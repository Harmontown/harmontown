WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:18.400
Hey everybody, welcome to the beautiful Dine-A-C typewriter, how's everybody doing tonight?

00:18.400 --> 00:25.760
Harmontown is now in session, you know what that means, let's give it up for our Dungeon

00:25.760 --> 00:42.280
Master Spencer Crittenden, I'm Rob Trabbe, I'm cop trolling tonight, thanks mom, let's

00:42.280 --> 00:55.920
give it up for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon, yeah, Dan Harmon, yeah.

00:55.920 --> 01:07.320
Thank you, thank you to my friends for showing up and supporting me, thank you, thank you

01:07.320 --> 01:15.760
to the audience for coming in and standing in line and buying a ticket at the right

01:15.760 --> 01:16.760
time.

01:16.760 --> 01:23.200
Damn, seems like back in the day you used to not come here the regular way, you used

01:23.200 --> 01:30.760
to come in a different way, and now it just seems like every time you come this other way.

01:30.760 --> 01:42.320
What happened to us, damn, I want to bring that back till the break is done, making love

01:42.320 --> 01:47.640
to you, damn.

01:47.640 --> 01:54.920
Okay, all right, what was the name of that song?

01:54.920 --> 01:58.200
I don't know, back in the day.

01:58.200 --> 02:05.680
So effort, lazy, lazy, lazy comedically, lazy creatively, lazy musically.

02:05.680 --> 02:13.240
Lazy opener, yeah, but also kind of in a positive way, like rolling out into the ocean, not a

02:13.240 --> 02:19.760
beached whale, the original whale to become a whale, after going like, I don't want to

02:19.760 --> 02:26.280
be a giant hippo, there's no market for this, I took a wrong turn at the Albuquerque of

02:26.280 --> 02:33.360
Tarwinian progress, like I somehow am basically like a big, blubbery pig on a beach.

02:33.360 --> 02:39.080
If these giant ham hocks were flippers, I could be the most powerful fucker in the ocean.

02:39.080 --> 02:42.960
I'm doing it, I'm going back, Todd, don't!

02:42.960 --> 02:50.600
Those are pre-whale, pre-aquatic whales, Steve Levy, Ice Bucket.

02:50.600 --> 03:04.160
Pre-whales, pre-whales, I went back to the water whale that I am, I also went back to

03:04.160 --> 03:13.000
the water, hey guys, what was I, am I not supposed to interpret that as you, he's practicing

03:13.000 --> 03:20.320
he needs to get in some errors, Rob is practicing hosting, because he's going to moderate run

03:20.320 --> 03:24.520
a Red Lobster.

03:24.520 --> 03:35.440
Table for five, follow that guy, pretty easy, pretty, doesn't seem that hard, a lot of the

03:35.440 --> 03:41.640
work seems to be being done by that guy and even the customer, follow that guy, yeah.

03:41.640 --> 03:45.440
It's a bit easy, it's not too, it's a bit easy.

03:45.440 --> 03:54.160
What is the deal with, when you go to a restaurant that has a host and also waiter people, is

03:54.160 --> 04:02.400
the host, is that a person, is it like the military, is it like the military where officer

04:02.400 --> 04:08.480
school is different from enlisted men, I was surprised to find out that never the twain

04:08.480 --> 04:09.480
shall meet.

04:09.480 --> 04:13.360
Yeah, the hosts are on the fast track, they get promoted to metal manager or whatever.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.440
They've never scrubbed a dish, possibly some of them have, some of them haven't, but at

04:16.440 --> 04:19.960
any rate, that's not really, they're like, I'd like to host.

04:19.960 --> 04:23.440
Well I believe that host is usually where you start and then you work up to waiter because

04:23.440 --> 04:25.320
then you get tips.

04:25.320 --> 04:35.520
Oh, the host is more like a shadow program, like Wonder Mutt at the Hall of Justice, yeah.

04:35.520 --> 04:42.160
I understand that sound you made, well because you're picturing a laborer and now I'm comparing

04:42.160 --> 04:43.640
them to an animal.

04:43.640 --> 04:44.640
Yes.

04:44.640 --> 04:48.040
But what an animal.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.560
First name is Wonder, yeah, exactly.

04:50.560 --> 04:55.880
I was more thinking in terms of the strata, like where you start, you're kind of in training

04:55.880 --> 05:00.800
because you're kind of like hanging back, but when you're the customer, you're perceiving

05:00.800 --> 05:06.680
the host as like some kind of, like they have power over things, I don't know, or at least

05:06.680 --> 05:07.680
I did.

05:07.680 --> 05:12.140
Yeah, they have a power over hospitality, like they're welcoming you.

05:12.140 --> 05:16.360
It feels like it's their place, but no, they can't even wait.

05:16.360 --> 05:26.240
I'm very conscious of my body today, I was inventorying my mood, that's a new word, inventorying,

05:26.240 --> 05:36.360
and I was like, I think maybe consciousness of your body should be like a mood, like sometimes

05:36.360 --> 05:39.720
you just feel, you're just like, there's nothing you're going to be able to do, sometimes

05:39.720 --> 05:46.400
you feel a little handsome.

05:46.400 --> 05:52.120
That's not, no, I did a little bit there at the end, I rift, I was like, go 90 degrees

05:52.120 --> 05:58.640
now, because like, what are you doing, you're telling them you feel fat, like what is your

05:58.640 --> 06:03.320
show and who are you, why are you talking into a microphone, who are they, what are

06:03.320 --> 06:04.320
they supposed to think about themselves?

06:04.320 --> 06:11.880
We're going to answer all these questions tonight on Dan Harmon's Harmontown.

06:11.880 --> 06:22.720
So Rob's going to be moderating the Rick and Morty Comic-Con panel, so he wants to practice

06:22.720 --> 06:23.720
hosting.

06:23.720 --> 06:31.920
Yeah, I want to practice, and I don't want it to turn into Harmontown, because no one

06:31.920 --> 06:34.200
wins that way.

06:34.200 --> 06:39.360
But you want to, well, yeah, and you picked a great place to practice.

06:39.360 --> 06:45.000
Well, no, no, no, hear me out, I'm usually not comptrolling, I'm usually here, and I

06:45.000 --> 06:49.280
usually come out, and you ignore me, and the only way I'm going to make it worth my drive

06:49.280 --> 06:57.240
here is pissing you off, so if I'm comptrolling, I'm kind of, you know, I have a job to do,

06:57.240 --> 07:03.800
you've said hi to me tonight, so, you know, bonus, win, win, win.

07:03.800 --> 07:07.360
I've got so much win.

07:07.360 --> 07:14.800
It is different, maybe I'm an elitist, and I think of hosts differently than guests,

07:14.800 --> 07:23.080
and busboys, like, it's connected, I'm thinking the same thing at a Benignans as I am in my

07:23.080 --> 07:25.800
stage craft, which hosts are important.

07:25.800 --> 07:29.320
You've done how many Comic-Con panels?

07:29.320 --> 07:31.480
Let's be serious for a second.

07:31.480 --> 07:36.800
Well, okay, so probably, there's been, like, what, three Rick and Morty ones, and then

07:36.800 --> 07:38.840
yeah, about three or five news.

07:38.840 --> 07:41.560
Well, let's just talk about Rick and Morty, okay, just talk about him.

07:41.560 --> 07:45.400
Okay, well, I'll go four, I think Rick and Morty's probably got four big panels.

07:45.400 --> 07:49.160
What are some do's and don'ts?

07:49.160 --> 07:55.400
Give me, start with the do's, go.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.680
Number one.

07:57.680 --> 08:04.320
I think, well, I think that big crowd dynamics in general, but you and I wrote on awards

08:04.320 --> 08:06.440
shows together.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.440
One and Emmy.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.440
Kid.

08:08.440 --> 08:13.720
But, you know, and so you're familiar with the kind, I don't have to advise you on this,

08:13.720 --> 08:19.560
but it's like, Hall H is like 3,000 people, like, or 6,000, how many does Hall H hold?

08:19.560 --> 08:20.560
Many, many thousands.

08:20.560 --> 08:21.560
I don't think that'll be a problem.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.560
My voice kind of carries.

08:22.560 --> 08:28.760
You know, crowds are different, like 150 people, like they, it's like you could get

08:28.760 --> 08:33.000
a laugh off of clearing your throat at the right time or taking the right pause and there's

08:33.000 --> 08:37.840
an interface and then the larger the crowd gets, it's not, they're dumber, it's just

08:37.840 --> 08:44.720
that they're kind of wearing gloves on their feelings, so like you're, it just, people

08:44.720 --> 08:48.680
make the mistake of thinking that that means that you have to dumb everything down.

08:48.680 --> 08:55.400
It's very close to that, but it's not, I think that's a negative thing to think that 3,000

08:55.400 --> 09:02.200
people aren't smarter than 150 people, but just in a different way.

09:02.200 --> 09:10.880
They're like, you're dealing with like a kind of like more of a on-off, like Frankenstein

09:10.880 --> 09:16.480
switch than a light switch in terms of like, you want to like be big and crisp with your

09:16.480 --> 09:23.800
hair, hey, who here wants to react to the word sandwich?

09:23.800 --> 09:28.920
And then you're like, shugunk, you know, well then it's just, it's just more, it's more

09:28.920 --> 09:33.480
of a big, it's a bigger, simpler, but more powerful machine.

09:33.480 --> 09:38.160
Is there anybody here going to Comic Con this year, anybody?

09:38.160 --> 09:39.160
Two people.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.160
Two people.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.160
All right.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.160
We'll see you in there.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.160
We'll see you in this room.

09:43.160 --> 09:46.360
That's riveting.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.720
Maybe they've seen you enough.

09:48.720 --> 09:49.720
Yeah.

09:49.720 --> 09:56.440
So, sorry, and then let's segue into, one of your jobs is going to be to introduce everybody.

09:56.440 --> 09:57.440
Right.

09:57.440 --> 10:00.760
Is there a story of somebody not doing that, right?

10:00.760 --> 10:01.760
No.

10:01.760 --> 10:02.760
No.

10:02.760 --> 10:03.760
No.

10:03.760 --> 10:07.120
We, we, we, we, We didn't Ryan Ridley come out dressed like...

10:07.120 --> 10:09.480
You guys remember Ryan Ridley?

10:09.480 --> 10:14.760
Well, I will, I will, I will let Ryan Ridley, I think we've already talked about it on the

10:14.760 --> 10:15.760
show.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.200
Ryan does a great job of explaining, like, what, what, what, what, what.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.440
I watched it online.

10:20.440 --> 10:27.480
It was way funnier than you told it, because it's, Ryan, Ryan, for those of you who don't

10:27.480 --> 10:31.520
know what we're talking about, Ryan Ridley, who was a writer on Rick and Morty, came out,

10:31.520 --> 10:37.520
he moderated, and he dressed up like a king of whatever, you know, something.

10:37.520 --> 10:41.480
He was a king, but like a king from a pack of cards almost.

10:41.480 --> 10:42.480
Right.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.680
He spent, he didn't like go, oh, I'm going to make a crown.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.840
And I'm going to get like my, oh, shitty wig or whatever.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.520
He spent some time on this costume.

10:51.520 --> 10:56.440
And then he comes out and he, like, and it's a huge room.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.200
So the silence is deafening.

10:58.200 --> 11:06.160
So he comes out and he's like, eh, expecting people to be laughing already.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.720
And it's, he sits there for a long time.

11:07.720 --> 11:13.200
Because the joke was, and it's a brilliant joke, Ryan's very, he's a genius, like, like

11:13.200 --> 11:20.160
the joke was that Game of Thrones panel was after ours and he was just there to, you know,

11:20.160 --> 11:25.000
kill the time, like, like the audience was waiting for, to get, he, he took the moderating

11:25.000 --> 11:27.920
gig so he could be at the Game of Thrones panel kind of thing.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.320
It didn't go over well.

11:29.320 --> 11:33.760
Well, because again, he looked like a deck of cards and he never said who he was.

11:33.760 --> 11:39.680
Yeah, he never, he never said, he didn't really kind of set up the bit for it to land.

11:39.680 --> 11:44.520
Well, and also, like, after it kind of like hit the skids, my memory is that he also never

11:44.520 --> 11:48.640
at any point said, by the way, my name is Ryan Ridley, I work on the show.

11:48.640 --> 11:55.200
I'm responsible for you, you like me, you just don't know, like, because a lot of the

11:55.200 --> 12:01.360
panels will be moderated by like some guy from Buzzfeed or something and I'm not diminishing

12:01.360 --> 12:02.360
that.

12:02.360 --> 12:05.800
It's just that people are used to in those halls with like, we don't, we don't, this

12:05.800 --> 12:11.960
person may be good at this job, bad at this job, inevitably who cares?

12:11.960 --> 12:17.040
Because like, what is being good or bad at that job, like, when the people are like,

12:17.040 --> 12:22.240
I just think the people are there to like, like, I don't want to use the word worship

12:22.240 --> 12:27.560
because we tend to punish, like, you know, like we, I don't know, we have like a negative

12:27.560 --> 12:34.240
view of like fandom in general kind of still, but, but like, you know, Comic Con is a mecca,

12:34.240 --> 12:39.160
we have journeyed there, blah, blah, blah, it is, the Kool-Aid is real.

12:39.160 --> 12:43.640
It's like, it's like, it's, it's, the Kool-Aid doesn't kill you, it's just good to drink

12:43.640 --> 12:44.640
it.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.360
And it take, because it's Kool-Aid, it tastes great.

12:46.360 --> 12:50.920
And it's like, the people are in this room of like, at least we can all fucking express

12:50.920 --> 12:56.680
that we love the Simpsons for the next 45 minutes without loving it wrong or like someone

12:56.680 --> 12:59.760
like letting us know that it was ugly the way we liked the Simpsons.

12:59.760 --> 13:02.880
It's like, it's like, it's just, there's something really powerful about that that

13:02.880 --> 13:07.320
probably is the same thing going on at a Grateful Dead concert, Burning Man, whatever.

13:07.320 --> 13:12.080
Why am I explaining audiences?

13:12.080 --> 13:15.680
Why don't we practice bringing people out, because that's going to be a big, that's the

13:15.680 --> 13:16.680
moderator thing.

13:16.680 --> 13:22.240
It's like, they're like there and, and like, they're like, who does this guy think he is?

13:22.240 --> 13:27.040
The meters, that meter's running, because like, it's like,

13:27.040 --> 13:30.840
But according to you, there's no way I can screw this up.

13:30.840 --> 13:36.960
Well, what about like, you're saying, you're saying, who cares?

13:36.960 --> 13:40.240
So I should just go on and be myself.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.240
Oh yeah.

13:41.240 --> 13:42.240
They'll love that.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.440
Why don't you bring someone out?

13:43.440 --> 13:44.440
Okay.

13:44.440 --> 13:55.400
Ladies and gentlemen, from his tour of America, is Jeff Bryan Davis from Whose Line Is It

13:55.400 --> 14:00.920
Anyway?

14:00.920 --> 14:03.040
Welcome back.

14:03.040 --> 14:06.600
This is Jeff Davis's first win.

14:06.600 --> 14:12.360
He's been on many different episodes of this podcast.

14:12.360 --> 14:13.360
Jeff Davis.

14:13.360 --> 14:14.360
Jeff Davis.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.920
Jeff Davis is now doing.

14:16.920 --> 14:17.920
Oh no.

14:17.920 --> 14:18.920
Oh damn.

14:18.920 --> 14:19.920
Okay.

14:19.920 --> 14:20.920
Okay.

14:20.920 --> 14:21.920
Okay.

14:21.920 --> 14:22.920
All right.

14:22.920 --> 14:23.920
All right.

14:23.920 --> 14:32.600
They just made out, no, no, no, I'm not kissing you.

14:32.600 --> 14:33.600
Okay.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.600
Oh, okay.

14:34.600 --> 14:39.280
Oh, well, if you're going to do it that way.

14:39.280 --> 14:44.760
That's like the fifth time I've made out with a man for comedy in 20 years and like,

14:44.760 --> 14:46.000
but it's all potent now.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.960
Like I'm like, yeah, I'm sorry, I was like, is there, the whole time I was going, Oh,

14:50.960 --> 14:54.000
is there such a thing called, is there gay face now?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.480
Is there like a, like Jeff Davis?

14:56.480 --> 14:57.480
What do you think?

14:57.480 --> 14:58.480
Is there gay face?

14:58.480 --> 15:02.120
Hey, that's a great interviewing question.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.320
Thank you.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.520
You are fucking ready to go.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.360
You know, I've been rehearsing.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.360
Yeah.

15:08.360 --> 15:09.520
The pump has been primed.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.520
You are ready.

15:10.520 --> 15:13.960
But I was also distracted by your tender lips.

15:13.960 --> 15:17.000
It was a loved kissing.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.200
It got kind of good there.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.120
I was like, I was like, I do this.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.920
There was a moment when we crossed, I mean, I don't know about you, I felt we crossed

15:24.920 --> 15:30.560
the threshold into kind of a, like a, a real thing.

15:30.560 --> 15:31.560
Yeah.

15:31.560 --> 15:38.160
Like I don't think I've ever felt the tender touch of another human being in the way that

15:38.160 --> 15:40.360
we experienced that just now.

15:40.360 --> 15:41.360
Okay.

15:41.360 --> 15:42.360
Good.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.360
Same page club.

15:43.360 --> 15:47.360
Also, if you, if you spend $5, you can see this on, for the subscription.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.360
Yeah.

15:48.360 --> 15:52.800
You can see Dan and me make up.

15:52.800 --> 15:56.120
We never said anything during all of Pride Month, by the way, we miss Pride Month.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.120
Like, I don't know.

15:57.120 --> 16:00.440
We'll say it now.

16:00.440 --> 16:04.760
I want to remind people that remember our guest, David Cummings, he is like, like Pride Month

16:04.760 --> 16:11.640
continues to be really like, strongly celebrated in horror fiction podcasts, like, or I'll

16:11.640 --> 16:16.760
just say the no sleep podcast, like they just do a fucking great job of like rolling out

16:16.760 --> 16:23.120
the LGBTQ carpet while without, and it's like, it's, it feels, you feel, you feel like you've

16:23.120 --> 16:28.240
done something for anyone by listening, but you feel also feel like you're cheating because

16:28.240 --> 16:30.520
you're like, but it's better.

16:30.520 --> 16:37.200
These stories about stories from gay couple perspectives that are about like not like how

16:37.200 --> 16:41.520
that are about like a hook coming through a window or like, it's like, it's more compelling.

16:41.520 --> 16:44.400
It's like here, you're, it's, it's better horror.

16:44.400 --> 16:45.400
Rob.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.240
I have a question for that.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.240
Where did the hook come from?

16:49.240 --> 16:50.240
I don't know.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.800
I got, I got high before the show interview.

16:52.800 --> 16:56.480
The hook coming from the window is cool idea.

16:56.480 --> 17:00.160
So what, what, what do you, yeah, like Rob, like, or what do you want to pretend it's

17:00.160 --> 17:03.040
a panel and get real hands on practice there?

17:03.040 --> 17:04.040
Yeah.

17:04.040 --> 17:07.400
Do you want to do some real like, yes, I guess, but are we pretending that, do you want to

17:07.400 --> 17:08.720
try pandering?

17:08.720 --> 17:15.360
Let's say like, get some pandering in, Dan, or Spencer, why don't you pitch me as a panelist

17:15.360 --> 17:19.920
like, like someone that Rob has to interview on the panel, all right, and I'll be that

17:19.920 --> 17:20.920
person.

17:20.920 --> 17:23.040
Rob, what do you think about this?

17:23.040 --> 17:28.880
Jeff is the guy who plays Morty.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.600
Okay.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.240
So Justin, yeah.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.400
Okay.

17:34.400 --> 17:44.920
So what's the nastiest, sickest, sexiest, like most like, oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck,

17:44.920 --> 17:52.440
oh, offensive thing that ever happened behind the scenes at Rick and Morty.

17:52.440 --> 18:02.080
Oh, well, one time we were in the edit bay, we were in the edit bay and, and Dan came

18:02.080 --> 18:09.880
into the edit bay with me and we just started really, really getting on each other's balls.

18:09.880 --> 18:15.120
And I mean, like, not in like a kissy, like touchy way, but we just, we really got on

18:15.120 --> 18:16.120
each other's balls.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.120
Oh, that's, yeah.

18:17.120 --> 18:21.880
And that's, and that's how, that's how we broke season four.

18:21.880 --> 18:22.880
Wow.

18:22.880 --> 18:23.880
Okay.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.480
Is that why the show takes so long to make?

18:26.480 --> 18:27.480
Yeah.

18:27.480 --> 18:28.720
That's another thing you want to hit a lot.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.840
When's the show coming out?

18:30.840 --> 18:31.840
What's taking so long?

18:31.840 --> 18:33.760
Why is the show coming out?

18:33.760 --> 18:34.760
What would be the best?

18:34.760 --> 18:37.160
Why is it so hard to make the damn show?

18:37.160 --> 18:38.160
Yeah.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.160
Why?

18:39.160 --> 18:41.120
Where are you at right now, Harmon?

18:41.120 --> 18:52.320
You and Justin, like where, in your 70 episode, Odyssey, 70 episodes, I don't like 70 anything.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.320
How are you?

18:53.320 --> 18:54.320
Where are you?

18:54.320 --> 18:55.320
Three?

18:55.320 --> 18:56.320
I mean, what the fuck are you gonna do?

18:56.320 --> 18:57.320
What the fuck are you faking?

18:57.320 --> 18:58.320
What the fuck?

18:58.320 --> 19:00.320
You bought a house with a giant pool.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.320
Jesus.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.320
You're gonna fucking die broke.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.320
Oh my God.

19:03.320 --> 19:04.320
You shine paperwork.

19:04.320 --> 19:07.800
There's no way that this is even humanly possible.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.800
And if it is, it's not even gonna be good.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.800
Yeah, you know, they're gonna be shit.

19:13.800 --> 19:14.800
Yeah.

19:14.800 --> 19:15.800
A.V.

19:15.800 --> 19:16.800
Clarke.

19:16.800 --> 19:23.800
This is Justin Roy, let's say that.

19:23.800 --> 19:28.040
I noticed, here's something, okay, I'm breaking the shit.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.800
This is me just breaking down.

19:29.800 --> 19:37.760
I was, I was looking at other cues and a panels and I noticed you were doing your homework.

19:37.760 --> 19:38.760
He really is.

19:38.760 --> 19:46.480
I, well, I don't phone anything in.

19:46.480 --> 19:49.520
Rob gave an insulting response to a high five.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.520
He will phone in a high five.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.520
Well, I cut my finger.

19:53.520 --> 19:54.520
I didn't.

19:54.520 --> 19:55.520
Oh, okay.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.520
You don't want to give me your age.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.520
You could make me feel better.

19:57.520 --> 19:58.520
Rob has AIDS.

19:58.520 --> 19:59.520
It's okay.

19:59.520 --> 20:00.520
We can talk about it.

20:00.520 --> 20:01.520
It's adorable.

20:01.520 --> 20:08.240
I noticed that your fans don't audition when they ask questions.

20:08.240 --> 20:16.520
Usually like when I've done panels, it's usually like, hello there, just one is new.

20:16.520 --> 20:22.240
And then they do like this very, they've been rehearsing this bit and then it comes off very

20:22.240 --> 20:28.000
like the whole audience goes what or whatever, but your, your, your fans at Rick and Morning

20:28.000 --> 20:34.480
fans, they're like, why did Doc do this or what's in his bottle or are those both trash

20:34.480 --> 20:39.800
cans from the, the, the Smith house or did he steal those or, or what, you know, like

20:39.800 --> 20:43.840
they have very specific question, which kind of cool, right?

20:43.840 --> 20:49.080
I mean, that's not really a question, but this is a, I don't know if you've noticed

20:49.080 --> 20:50.080
that.

20:50.080 --> 20:54.240
I think there's, well, I guess I haven't is my answer because I've only done panels

20:54.240 --> 20:59.200
for community and Rick and Morty and I, I don't, there's not a lot of like, I think

20:59.200 --> 21:03.160
there's like a self policing kind of enzyme in the air.

21:03.160 --> 21:08.600
People that might otherwise, like they want to, they want to, they want to contribute to

21:08.600 --> 21:13.280
like this very short runtime, you know, they don't want to be the one that asks the question

21:13.280 --> 21:19.880
that causes other people a problem of some kind, you know, like there's a lot of pressure,

21:19.880 --> 21:24.220
like you're lining up to ask your question into the mic and every once in a while, there's

21:24.220 --> 21:31.000
people that take us a shot at the moon with some kind of larger than just a regular question

21:31.000 --> 21:37.400
bit, but like 80% of those actually work, like they're good, like if somebody is just

21:37.400 --> 21:41.520
like in a costume and they go like, I have one question, when am I coming back?

21:41.520 --> 21:45.640
It's like, oh, Bluedow, next season when Popeye gets super.

21:45.640 --> 21:50.560
I dressed up as Mr. Poopy Butthole and asked Sarah like, why'd you shoot me?

21:50.560 --> 21:51.560
Right.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.560
That's funny.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.680
No, the audience loved it.

21:54.680 --> 21:55.680
Yeah.

21:55.680 --> 21:59.000
So who's going to be on the panel with who's on the on the dais?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.200
I think Dan is right.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.560
You're going to show up for that, right?

22:03.560 --> 22:04.560
Yeah.

22:04.560 --> 22:10.360
If I'm feeling better about my body, but just do head and shoulders with the camera.

22:10.360 --> 22:15.040
There's mirrors all over the green room and just kind of like, and it's it's what it's

22:15.040 --> 22:19.760
just one of those like, that's what I think it's like a bio rhythmic thing, like my body

22:19.760 --> 22:25.640
doesn't look any different to, but I just like my t-shirts like a tarp like laid over

22:25.640 --> 22:35.480
this bowling pin made of like like softening candle wax and like, that sounds like a lyric

22:35.480 --> 22:40.280
and I like, I like, I look in the mirror and I go like, hey, fix that posture that and

22:40.280 --> 22:45.400
then I'll like, go like this and it gets really depressing because it's like, ah, a

22:45.400 --> 22:51.680
fucking monster with good posture, like your belly didn't change shape at all.

22:51.680 --> 22:55.280
It just like moved on the Y axis.

22:55.280 --> 22:58.320
Have you been backsliding with your, with your Dave Klan workouts or?

22:58.320 --> 22:59.320
I don't know.

22:59.320 --> 23:00.320
Well, I don't know.

23:00.320 --> 23:01.320
Certainly.

23:01.320 --> 23:03.920
Well, I, maybe yes, but not through his fault.

23:03.920 --> 23:10.640
I, but you know, there's been, yeah, I'm sure it's like I'm sliding in, in a, in a way

23:10.640 --> 23:12.640
that I'm maybe noticing or whatever.

23:12.640 --> 23:13.640
Yeah.

23:13.640 --> 23:14.640
I mean, I don't want.

23:14.640 --> 23:15.640
He's up.

23:15.640 --> 23:16.640
I'm controlling.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.640
I did want it.

23:17.640 --> 23:18.640
Hey, you didn't answer that question.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.640
I'm going to get to the truth.

23:19.640 --> 23:20.640
Who's on the panel?

23:20.640 --> 23:21.640
You are.

23:21.640 --> 23:22.640
Justin.

23:22.640 --> 23:23.640
I don't know.

23:23.640 --> 23:24.640
Gee, I don't know.

23:24.640 --> 23:25.640
Yeah.

23:25.640 --> 23:26.640
I don't actually know.

23:26.640 --> 23:27.640
Another voice talent.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.640
Is it like not like Ryan Ridley?

23:28.640 --> 23:29.640
Who do you think?

23:29.640 --> 23:43.840
I would, I would assume that it's some voice, voice people, but I don't know how they pick

23:43.840 --> 23:44.840
them and voice people.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.840
Yeah.

23:45.840 --> 23:49.480
It's probably going to be Chris and Sarah and Spencer, right?

23:49.480 --> 23:58.320
I would, I would, you know, yeah, probably not me, but I would hate to be wrong about

23:58.320 --> 23:59.320
that.

23:59.320 --> 24:00.320
All right.

24:00.320 --> 24:02.480
Well, yeah, I said probably somebody you'll be there.

24:02.480 --> 24:08.160
Rob, Rob, if you could ask one question, right, what would it be, Dan, are you coming

24:08.160 --> 24:10.160
into work tomorrow?

24:10.160 --> 24:12.160
Yeah, good.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.320
I like it when you're there.

24:13.320 --> 24:14.320
Yeah.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.560
We got a lot done today.

24:15.560 --> 24:17.520
We got a lot done today.

24:17.520 --> 24:21.480
Kind of two, almost two episodes, almost two stories broken.

24:21.480 --> 24:22.480
Yeah.

24:22.480 --> 24:23.480
Are you working on it?

24:23.480 --> 24:25.720
Yeah, I think I am.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.600
I wouldn't call it working.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.000
Hello.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
He has his moments.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Are you a writer, producer?

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
What are you doing?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
I'm not sure.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.520
I just show up until they tell me to get the fuck out.

24:39.520 --> 24:40.760
I don't really know.

24:40.760 --> 24:43.200
We're communicating in this language in the writer's room.

24:43.200 --> 24:48.680
It's like an old married couple, and it's like, I don't, I assume it's bad for the other

24:48.680 --> 24:49.680
people.

24:49.680 --> 24:56.680
Why would that, because there's a showrunner and kind of guy that's deputized, like his

24:56.680 --> 25:03.080
job is to keep the trains running on time, but it's like, but he can't fire me.

25:03.080 --> 25:05.560
And then he's like, and then I'm just doing this bit with Schrab.

25:05.560 --> 25:10.840
I'll tell you what, I'll be like, okay, well, what if, what if the space suit had a thing?

25:10.840 --> 25:16.080
And if it had a thing, don't fucking question me.

25:16.080 --> 25:21.240
If you have something to contribute, fucking pitch something, otherwise shut the fuck up.

25:21.240 --> 25:25.840
I'm just trying to help, man.

25:25.840 --> 25:30.800
If you want to help pitch something, I pitched something a couple minutes ago.

25:30.800 --> 25:39.480
Your pitch was a question was like, why isn't Rick Morty?

25:39.480 --> 25:40.480
And this will go on.

25:40.480 --> 25:41.480
Bitch.

25:41.480 --> 25:42.480
No, there was a question.

25:42.480 --> 25:43.480
For a really long time.

25:43.480 --> 25:44.480
And anyways, it's center.

25:44.480 --> 25:50.800
And it's like, it's kind of like, it's just, it's just a 40 year, 30 years.

25:50.800 --> 25:51.800
It's just, it's just.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.160
How much does a job pay?

25:54.160 --> 25:57.760
I'll let you know at the end of the month.

25:57.760 --> 26:01.720
And I do have to wonder, like, why, yeah, why are you, are you making a living doing

26:01.720 --> 26:02.720
this?

26:02.720 --> 26:03.720
I hope so.

26:03.720 --> 26:06.200
I'm, Kate's going to be really pissed.

26:06.200 --> 26:10.440
I'm like, what about, what about, what about the younger writers that are like, fuck, man.

26:10.440 --> 26:13.560
I'm going to get, get up in the morning and they're like, maybe I went to Harvard.

26:13.560 --> 26:14.960
What the fuck is going on right now?

26:14.960 --> 26:16.320
Like, so wait, so what?

26:16.320 --> 26:17.320
What is this?

26:17.320 --> 26:22.960
Six years of the onion and now this is, he just, he just, he just wanted his husband

26:22.960 --> 26:23.960
at work.

26:23.960 --> 26:34.760
But we, they, they're coming around, they realize that's how we work and we do, we did a good

26:34.760 --> 26:35.760
job today.

26:35.760 --> 26:42.280
Yeah, but well, I wonder if my mind goes back to the note we would get in Milwaukee from

26:42.280 --> 26:45.920
the improv community.

26:45.920 --> 26:46.920
Conference sports or did LS?

26:46.920 --> 26:51.640
Well, but I mean, I feel like, I feel like we would, we got the same note in both, which

26:51.640 --> 26:56.800
goes to show you that we had the problem because one was like, they were very different from

26:56.800 --> 27:01.960
each other, but they both would express to us, basically, like, in the politest way,

27:01.960 --> 27:08.080
it was like, like, it would be nice when you guys are doing something, if you would let

27:08.080 --> 27:15.320
people know what it is and how they can help, like, like, and not just make, like, latch

27:15.320 --> 27:22.600
onto each other and make fun of everything around you in some, like, heavenly creatures,

27:22.600 --> 27:29.840
like, twisted, like, two British girls, like, fantasizing about homicide in the 50s, kind

27:29.840 --> 27:35.280
of, like, vibe you give off, like, it's like, all of a sudden, just talking in diehard references

27:35.280 --> 27:42.200
and there's like, you know, like, a referee, you know, I don't, what, so you recreated

27:42.200 --> 27:47.520
diehard, that's not the theater game, all right.

27:47.520 --> 27:51.360
I remember when I first met you, was it, like, 94?

27:51.360 --> 27:59.480
Probably, yeah, at Milwaukee Comedy Sports Tournament, and I had been in LA Comedy Sports

27:59.480 --> 28:04.560
for, like, I think, like, six months, like, I was pretty new, and I had heard about the

28:04.560 --> 28:10.320
New York Comedy Sports guys, like, Talman and Mike Rock and, like, all the other guys,

28:10.320 --> 28:16.600
and then you guys, the Dead L Wives, and I was so intimidated to meet you and we all,

28:16.600 --> 28:19.880
like, met and wanted to hang out with each other, but we never really talked, we just

28:19.880 --> 28:25.120
kind of stared at our feet and had a drink, but then I saw you guys do the Dead L Wives

28:25.120 --> 28:31.520
show and it fucking blew my mind, it was really, like, oh, like, you can be funny and weird

28:31.520 --> 28:37.720
and not give a fuck about the audience, because you guys truly didn't care about the quality

28:37.720 --> 28:42.840
of what was going on, but that's why it was funny, that you cared about quality in the

28:42.840 --> 28:45.880
right way, which is like, like, we're gonna do what we want.

28:45.880 --> 28:51.960
It just didn't, we didn't know, we didn't have any option of pleasing the audience,

28:51.960 --> 28:54.360
like, we wouldn't know how, so.

28:54.360 --> 28:58.680
But you were signing, like, Skud Books, and I think that's when I first met you, you

28:58.680 --> 29:03.440
were sitting at a little table and you were signing Skud, I didn't know what that was,

29:03.440 --> 29:04.440
and I just wanted-

29:04.440 --> 29:05.440
Most people don't.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.440
Right.

29:06.440 --> 29:07.440
All right.

29:07.440 --> 29:09.440
It's time for a segment.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.440
Oh, shit.

29:10.440 --> 29:14.080
One of your jobs as a host will be to deal with segments.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.080
Okay.

29:15.080 --> 29:20.120
And since you didn't bring music, you have to sing, like, if you want to add a musical

29:20.120 --> 29:21.120
sting to it.

29:21.120 --> 29:27.120
It's time for Spencer to update us on My Backyard B problem.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.120
Oh, okay.

29:28.120 --> 29:32.680
When it's time for Spencer to update you on the piece.

29:32.680 --> 29:35.400
Oh, thank you, Zach.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.280
Four wings, six legs.

29:38.280 --> 29:41.040
Do you guys remember when we tried really hard-

29:41.040 --> 29:42.600
I said musical sting.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.600
That was okay.

29:44.600 --> 29:47.040
And I don't think that got the full credit.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.040
It deserves.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.040
All right.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.040
Go ahead, Rob.

29:50.040 --> 29:57.800
You remember when we spent, like, an afternoon trying to break or figure out, like, how to

29:57.800 --> 30:03.720
do the Austin Powers as a B movie?

30:03.720 --> 30:06.520
We came up with, do I make you honey, B-B?

30:06.520 --> 30:08.520
Oh, my God.

30:08.520 --> 30:09.520
Wait, wait, wait.

30:09.520 --> 30:10.520
Wow.

30:10.520 --> 30:11.520
Oh, B-Hive.

30:11.520 --> 30:12.520
Oh, B-Hive.

30:12.520 --> 30:13.520
Oh, B-Hive.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.520
Oh, B-Hive.

30:14.520 --> 30:15.520
Oh, B-Hive.

30:15.520 --> 30:17.520
And we were, like, cackling, but we were just like, what would we call it?

30:17.520 --> 30:20.520
What would we call it?

30:20.520 --> 30:21.520
Austin pollen.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.520
Austin pollen.

30:22.520 --> 30:25.940
That's not nearly as good as O-B-Hive.

30:25.940 --> 30:27.040
Busting.

30:27.040 --> 30:28.520
Busting.

30:28.520 --> 30:29.920
B-Hive.

30:29.920 --> 30:30.900
Busting.

30:30.900 --> 30:32.400
O-B-Hive.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.400
O-B-Hive.

30:33.400 --> 30:37.400
Do I make you honey, baby?

30:37.400 --> 30:41.500
Do I make you honey?

30:41.500 --> 30:42.500
Honeymaker.

30:42.500 --> 30:43.500
Stinging water.

30:43.500 --> 30:45.000
Do I make you honey, baby?

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Do I make you honey, baby?

30:46.000 --> 30:54.040
Who was there when we did seven hours at the rustic end of about I just got back from so-and-so and my boy on my arms

30:54.040 --> 30:57.480
Tired were you there for that one? No, I wasn't there. That was there

30:58.360 --> 31:03.600
Damn, I don't know. Okay. I don't know. I was there when we spent seven hours

31:04.200 --> 31:06.760
re-enacting what the first submarine was

31:10.720 --> 31:15.280
People built a submarine ago. Okay, we're gonna have to get our best. We have to do what?

31:15.280 --> 31:17.280
We have to wait. We have to get our best

31:18.280 --> 31:23.240
Sailors we get everybody there and we're gonna put them in a lead tube and sink it

31:23.240 --> 31:26.680
I mean their job is to keep the boat up and then I go well

31:26.680 --> 31:56.520
We can't tell them until it's sink and so we keep redoing them like the Navy has trained

31:56.520 --> 31:58.520
These men their entire life

31:59.640 --> 32:05.460
On top of the water you're asking them to go against it every

32:15.000 --> 32:17.800
It's like getting BA on a plane in the A-Team. I

32:18.840 --> 32:20.840
Don't fly Hannibal like

32:20.840 --> 32:26.520
What BA we can't take a jeep to deal with killer ants in the Yucatan

32:27.200 --> 32:31.840
I don't care sucker. I pity the fool who tries to make me fly and then they're like, okay

32:31.840 --> 32:33.840
Have a glass of milk mr. T. You love it

32:34.840 --> 32:40.440
And it's like that's what they had to do with the sailors. They're like, you'll thank us at the fucking nautical Emmys. Yes

32:42.760 --> 32:47.120
Yeah, who is the first I mean, I know that like there was the first people that tried to make a

32:47.120 --> 32:55.200
Submersible thing they were crazy people. They had to determine the first time you built a U-boat or a submarine

32:55.200 --> 33:00.240
And you put a bunch of fuckers on that thing. That's crazy. Yeah, that's murder. Oh, man

33:00.960 --> 33:03.880
I did gentlemen your job is to sink. Yeah

33:04.920 --> 33:11.240
Are you fucking kidding me? This boat is made to sink. I'm not coming near it guys. Don't worry. We've packed

33:11.240 --> 33:18.440
Hey, 30% of this boat is packed with baking soda. Can I ask a little bit at Admiral?

33:18.680 --> 33:20.880
My name is Ensign Davis

33:21.880 --> 33:28.400
I'm noticing there's no sales on this boat. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it was I believe I may be wrong about this

33:28.400 --> 33:33.400
There's probably historians in the audience and things and there's but but I know there is a story about

33:34.080 --> 33:35.120
the

33:35.120 --> 33:41.920
Civil War what there was a con I think they were Confederates if you can believe that those little those little dickens

33:43.160 --> 33:45.160
What are they doing thinking about science?

33:47.120 --> 33:52.520
Well, God said I can own people however we might be able to breathe underwater

33:54.040 --> 33:56.680
Well, wait a minute pick a lane. Oh

33:57.360 --> 34:02.880
We're saying to you is one day. We'll live in a fucking hive mind. Yeah, but we're gonna fight that a little bit

34:02.880 --> 34:06.320
Think about how much you have to love slavery to think that you can breathe on

34:07.760 --> 34:11.800
To it's like being a flat earth or so dedicated to your cause that you

34:12.800 --> 34:17.300
Space program that works because you want to take pictures of the flat earth and you're like

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
Say cheese you round piece of shit. I

34:22.880 --> 34:28.120
Know you're flat and they're like holy shit. You made your own spaceship. Yeah, fuck you. I'm not a dummy

34:28.120 --> 34:32.120
It's just an accent

34:32.880 --> 34:35.080
There's a lot of smart southern people

34:35.840 --> 34:42.280
Fucking oodles of them. Yeah, it's just a way you talk John Oliver's got a real low-class British accent

34:42.600 --> 34:47.440
What was the first I know this way? I can't think right now. What was the first submersible in the Civil War?

34:47.440 --> 34:53.840
It was like Bathysphere is probably first right which is just on a big crane and so it's not like it's not a

34:53.840 --> 35:01.840
Self-contained it doesn't cruise around but they would use to go underwater and they would go up to like a like a sailing vessel and

35:02.360 --> 35:06.120
Like that's not bombs. Well the Civil War thing. I think was that yet

35:06.120 --> 35:14.000
It was basically like it was it was a higher tech equivalent of six dudes putting a bathtub over their heads and

35:14.960 --> 35:20.600
Carrying a spear with a bomb on the end of it. So they could walk up to ships and like

35:20.600 --> 35:26.760
It's kind of that's it. That's hyperbole. Is anybody in the audience like relatively is anybody here in the civil war like

35:27.440 --> 35:33.800
That's civil war. Do we have any Confederates in the house the guy they kind of blew themselves up

35:33.800 --> 35:36.360
But they also did accomplish like a lot

35:36.360 --> 35:40.840
I think there's a it's a very twisted strange story because there was also a bit of forensics to it like

35:41.440 --> 35:43.440
No one knows what happened down there

35:44.800 --> 35:49.880
They succeeded in their mission and then exploded I think is what it was and no one knows what went wrong

35:49.880 --> 35:51.880
Was there a lot of

35:52.080 --> 35:54.840
Naval battles during the Civil War. Yeah

35:55.880 --> 35:59.760
What was it? I can't yeah, there was a bunch of there was the ironclads and

36:00.800 --> 36:06.040
And there were also submersibles that would go and try to torpedo the it was more about I mean it was it was you're talking

36:06.040 --> 36:09.680
It's like blockades and things because you're talking about supply lines chiefly

36:09.680 --> 36:15.720
You're not you're not like competing for domination of the seas except in the but then again, that's a description of all war

36:15.720 --> 36:19.640
It's just that no there weren't there aren't a lot of famous like water lose happening

36:19.640 --> 36:25.920
On the water. Why did it water loo? I'm like I always pictured water loo. What did water loo the elbow?

36:26.960 --> 36:30.240
Hey, I'd rather you know enough about the

36:31.120 --> 36:39.000
Conquering the seas I want to hear about conquering the bees. Hello. Let's go back. Yeah, we have that intro music

36:39.000 --> 36:40.700
This is all part of that segment

36:40.700 --> 36:42.200
Yeah

36:42.200 --> 36:44.200
Hit it

36:44.280 --> 36:46.280
six legs

36:46.280 --> 36:52.720
Four wings four wings four wings four wings four wings pollen sacks on the knees

36:53.920 --> 37:01.480
Terrian neck cargo. You're the bees knees. You're the bees knees. You're the bees knees mother fucker. Please listen to my

37:02.040 --> 37:06.920
Please they don't know nothing. I'm the flea. I ain't a bee but Paula makes me sneeze

37:07.520 --> 37:08.760
yo

37:08.760 --> 37:10.760
King Kingdom

37:10.760 --> 37:12.760

37:12.760 --> 37:14.760
Oh

Phylum insect insectoid insect a insect a

37:22.280 --> 37:24.280
Order after Phylum King Philip

37:32.840 --> 37:37.840
Order height height height hymen hymenoptera hymenoptera. That's bees and ants

37:38.960 --> 37:40.480
Okay

37:40.480 --> 37:42.480
taxonomy right

37:42.480 --> 37:45.400
Hi, I'm a hymen. I'm a hymenologist

37:48.720 --> 37:50.720
I'm a hymenologist

37:52.440 --> 37:54.440
That's what I'm talking about

37:55.360 --> 37:59.880
It's in session. I'm the hymenologist. I'll remove that shit before you

38:02.040 --> 38:09.440
Spencer what what's the new deal with bees in the backyard? We're getting rid of them just quickly

38:09.440 --> 38:15.480
I looked it up. Wait, but don't ever get rid of the bees. We need bees submarine. No, we don't need bees

38:15.480 --> 38:17.240
That's a common misconception

38:17.240 --> 38:23.320
Call it or what do you call it colony collapse disorder is a natural thing that should be allowed to continue

38:23.920 --> 38:25.920
until all bees are gone

38:26.760 --> 38:29.440
And I won't hear anything else

38:30.160 --> 38:35.200
On the subject. No, but there was a seven-man submarine that yeah, they had a bomb spear

38:35.200 --> 38:40.640
They they sank a ship and then they've got lost before they returned and then they basically

38:41.480 --> 38:43.920
Mission did the monitor. That's what I'm thinking of

38:45.120 --> 38:50.640
Was it an ankle or was it a submersible? I don't know the HL Hunley was the Confederate submarine then they did it again

38:50.640 --> 38:53.840
And the same thing happened. They they sank a ship and the crew all died

38:54.400 --> 38:56.400
Great times. Anyway bees, huh?

38:57.120 --> 38:59.120
Well, the story isn't a good story

38:59.120 --> 39:02.800
I called I called up this this bee man the good bee man

39:02.800 --> 39:05.640
Okay, so last time we talked about the bees

39:05.640 --> 39:11.240
There's this this comical bee man who came and he was hammering on a wall and he wasn't getting too far

39:11.400 --> 39:16.680
It was great. Oh boy. I had a great time. He was collecting where are these bees that live in a tree

39:16.680 --> 39:22.280
What's going on? Oh, they live in a wall Jeff. Okay, there's a retaining wall that holds back some dirt

39:22.280 --> 39:25.760
And behind that wall are just a bunch of bees because there's like a hole

39:26.080 --> 39:31.280
The wall is adjacent to another wall and that wall not the retaining wall has a hole in it

39:31.280 --> 39:37.000
And so the bees crawl in that hole these bees are these the one. Oh, they're the worst. Yeah, they sting you

39:37.000 --> 39:42.760
Holy shit. Have you ever been stung by a bee? I've only no never I've never I've stepped on a bee

39:42.760 --> 39:46.000
And I got stung by stepping on a bee that counts as that's being

39:47.000 --> 39:54.600
That was me getting like stinging a bee by killing it mean I've never I've never had a be maybe maybe the bee

39:54.600 --> 39:56.600
Got stung by your foot. Oh

39:57.720 --> 39:59.720
Shit

39:59.720 --> 40:05.960
He was the true be all along, but this is like a colony of honey bees living in my wall. Yeah, honey bees

40:06.960 --> 40:10.920
But bees never did me any dirt bees are always just fucking minding their biz

40:11.360 --> 40:14.960
But one time I haven't had a whole colony in your house minding their biz

40:18.440 --> 40:26.400
You don't deserve me I don't you don't know deserve minding their biz. That's not great. It's great

40:26.400 --> 40:32.040
I don't know. This is a comedy Spencer. This is the kind of times right now. Yes, I

40:33.320 --> 40:38.840
Don't know. I mean, I don't want to shut your jokes, but I will if I have to

40:39.840 --> 40:42.600
No, I get it. We all get it. I'm a fucking genius

40:43.320 --> 40:47.960
Well, no one can argue that you see how easy this is not comfortable now. I'm just loose as a fucking Christmas

40:47.960 --> 40:52.360
I know you know what I have to go through now. You're fucking. Yeah, you're just torture

40:52.360 --> 41:00.600
You know, this is the podium here that the a little lectern is a fucking curse because it inhibits you they call it old coffin bones

41:02.280 --> 41:08.400
That's what the the the very small community of Comptroller is calling. I know you're jargon down in the galley

41:08.400 --> 41:16.000
I didn't know that you were so hip. I know you're you're your Comptroller slang that you try to use to say say stuff

41:16.000 --> 41:21.320
It's all time to time to go stand in front of old coffin bones. I know that means the lectern

41:21.320 --> 41:23.320
Yeah

41:23.560 --> 41:25.560
Lectern Clyde

41:26.880 --> 41:28.360
Damn

41:28.360 --> 41:34.200
All right, so Spencer. There's a colony of honey bees living in my back. How do you know they're honey bees? Well

41:34.640 --> 41:41.280
They have you like that every which way but loose reference. I just like drop on you

41:43.600 --> 41:49.320
He knows two people in the audience. Hey, yeah, somebody else is over 45

41:49.320 --> 41:57.140
Well, I mean how many kinds of bees are there like most of them are honey bees, right? Otherwise, they're like wasps or some shit

41:57.400 --> 42:04.000
Yeah, there's a bumblebee yellow jackets. Those are yeah, there's those guys. What are actually wasps

42:04.000 --> 42:09.200
We called those bees in Milwaukee. We were just like oh, it's a bee, but those were wasps the yellow jackets, right?

42:09.200 --> 42:15.000
What are you? Well, there's yellow jackets the for what I understand this all great people guessing about bugs

42:15.000 --> 42:21.600
To me the wasps are those giant ones that have the super long limbs and the super kind of extended

42:21.960 --> 42:24.160
Hornets, I would call those wasps, but I don't know

42:24.680 --> 42:29.960
We got a we got a real I would say yellow jackets or hornets basically, but I mean, I don't know

42:30.480 --> 42:36.080
There's not one entomologist in the audience not even like a we don't got a confederates scholar

42:36.080 --> 42:39.680
We've got no entomologists. No confederates. What do you people do?

42:40.960 --> 42:42.960
You're not very specialized

42:42.960 --> 42:46.400
You don't know about bugs and you don't support slavery with the fuck

42:47.880 --> 42:49.880
We're gonna find out what you're good at tonight

42:51.560 --> 42:55.520
What do you think kills you what do you think is the common denominator of these people out here?

42:55.520 --> 42:57.520
I think they're they're all morticians

42:58.240 --> 43:04.640
I don't know. I don't know they seem like nice people. I don't know what I mean that who plays

43:05.920 --> 43:07.920
recreational highlight

43:07.920 --> 43:16.320
Two people two people two people. All right, we're gonna we're getting there. We're we're tracking down a trail of clues over there

43:16.720 --> 43:18.720
It's like guess who?

43:18.720 --> 43:24.520
All right, so yeah, so there's a bunch of honey bees living in the back wall. Yeah, we had a guy out

43:24.520 --> 43:29.920
He was like, uh, you didn't tell me there was a wall. I was like, I definitely told you there's a wall

43:30.040 --> 43:34.760
That happened again. No, no this time around so so before that guy came

43:34.760 --> 43:39.200
We had the guy from this company came he looked like he looked like he was 16

43:39.200 --> 43:43.960
And like I know I must be getting old because I'm like you're an adult you can have a job or something

43:43.960 --> 43:46.840
He's like fuck you and you're like you can be offended by being called young

43:47.400 --> 43:50.880
Yeah, when you're young. Yeah, all right. You have to be really

43:53.800 --> 43:59.400
These bees are concerned like you're worried about what's what's the what's the what's the fucking well

43:59.400 --> 44:05.040
What's the for you guys have the yards come on there to all I know is that these electronic

44:05.040 --> 44:12.280
Dufuses are trying to like run wire somewhere so they can make my doorbell connect to just a gun that shoots me in the face

44:14.040 --> 44:19.520
And and and they're they're I I don't have that I can't look them in the eyes to tell them

44:19.520 --> 44:21.520
They're working on a house that no one lives in anymore and

44:22.680 --> 44:26.560
Because I feel like Allison might I feel like they

44:26.560 --> 44:30.680
Per this is their purgatory. They deserve to work on this house until they die and

44:31.440 --> 44:33.800
And and and so I don't talk to them

44:33.800 --> 44:35.600
But I guess they're stringing wire back there

44:35.600 --> 44:38.320
And they needed to go through a wall and one of the walls had bees in it

44:38.320 --> 44:43.240
So they the only one immediately quit ran away and said enjoy your doorbell

44:44.000 --> 44:48.640
And like they're waiting for us to deal with bees so they can is it around the wire

44:48.640 --> 44:54.520
This is a new house or the old house. I'm not never doing anything like this again at any house I ever live in

44:54.520 --> 44:59.680
You're just gonna get 12 boomboxes. Yeah, you don't have to these guys. These guys are afraid of bees

45:00.000 --> 45:07.920
Why do you got a wire the wall? I don't have to I don't even want to be there anymore be there. He doesn't want to be

45:08.920 --> 45:10.520
there

45:10.520 --> 45:12.520
Thank you

45:12.560 --> 45:15.060
You just want to mind your own business

45:16.720 --> 45:19.040
Hey, is this is this bit work?

45:19.040 --> 45:26.720
Okay, let me ask let me ask let me ask and and tell me if I'm not the first person to do this because this

45:38.640 --> 45:39.880
So far

45:55.600 --> 46:00.720

46:01.840 --> 46:03.840
Show business is called show fun

46:05.280 --> 46:09.600

46:50.840 --> 46:57.240
It's called show. That's not even that's not even how I understand that. Yeah, I've never heard people go like

46:57.240 --> 47:02.200
It's not called show friends. It's called show business, right? They don't abbreviate it and they don't say fun. I

47:02.200 --> 47:08.960
Hear fun all the time. I sign folks because it's a constant problem in Hollywood people having too much fun

47:08.960 --> 47:14.240
And it getting in the way of business. No, it's people having friendships. That's the thing that gets in the way

47:14.560 --> 47:21.000
Okay, all right. It's an agent that made up this thing. All right. It's like hey, it's not called show friends

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
You're saying don't open with this

Screwed it out. It's called so far. Yeah, I screwed it up

47:34.960 --> 47:41.720
It's like a Steve Martin thing, but it's not you need to you need to take the same Steve Martin absurdism and put it on a

47:41.960 --> 47:49.800
Different area entirely like where you go like, you know, two two two lefts don't make a or two two wrongs

47:49.800 --> 47:54.720
Don't make a right. They make a wrong wrong, you know, like that's the formula do it over there

47:55.520 --> 47:57.520
safer interesting

47:57.520 --> 48:01.320
Okay, if you're if we're gonna do the bee thing

49:06.400 --> 49:11.560
Million down I was putting his finger in so it's all based on why you put the pinky on your face. Well. Yeah

What is it based on your face? How did your face what what where would you put 75 cents?

49:18.520 --> 49:22.200
Like what's the pinky equivalent of 75 cents? Well, if this is 10

49:25.240 --> 49:27.240

49:37.840 --> 49:41.200
On YouTube not on YouTube in my apartment

49:42.120 --> 49:45.640
God damn it. You guys who by applause knows what Josh for is

49:46.840 --> 49:53.440
Who by applause knows what piece of anatomy is heavily featured the same people probably about half

49:56.520 --> 49:59.080
I think it was the best thing that's ever happened

49:59.600 --> 50:05.560
We all we were having lunch at home restaurant on Hillhurst and it was the Dan

50:05.560 --> 50:07.480
Rob

50:07.480 --> 50:09.480
Tom and I right maybe maybe Robin Roth

50:10.040 --> 50:12.040
Yeah, we all said let's make

50:12.080 --> 50:15.680
No one had ever seen just for we knew that I think that we knew that

50:16.320 --> 50:23.040
Mario van Peebles wasn't it Michael Cain Michael Cain wasn't it and that's all we knew and then we all said you

50:23.880 --> 50:26.400
meet back at Rob's place at three o'clock and

50:27.040 --> 50:30.360
Everybody make jobs for and whoever gets closest wins

50:30.360 --> 50:35.840
To what we think happened and we because we're gonna watch it. We're gonna watch it all and

50:36.240 --> 50:40.080
We got to Rob's place and I remember knocking on the door because it was the apartment

50:40.080 --> 50:44.680
I used to live inside and I'm knocking the door and I hear Rob laughing and he's so high

50:44.680 --> 50:48.080
You can just you can just feel the weed going on and he's

50:50.520 --> 50:52.520
And

50:54.320 --> 50:58.880
His jaws for Dan came closest Dan actually came closest to the actual story

50:58.880 --> 51:03.280
An animated like really impressive thing. It's super fun

51:03.280 --> 51:07.160
And you kind of got close to what the actual story structure was

51:07.560 --> 51:10.960
Rob put a piece of duct tape on his penis and

51:11.600 --> 51:13.600
made a shark fin

51:13.640 --> 51:16.000
With the numeral four on it

51:17.880 --> 51:20.920
And he put like a little eyeball on the head of his dick

51:21.680 --> 51:28.000
To make a shark called Jaws for and he fucked a lemon or orange or lemon

51:28.000 --> 51:35.760
It was like an orange orange, but it was you know, it came off lemony in the in the and the because you did a color pass on it, right?

51:38.920 --> 51:47.160
So it was like he had two oranges on pencils and one was Michael Cain and one was Catherine Deneuve for no reason yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and

51:48.920 --> 51:50.920
So fucking stone doing

51:50.920 --> 51:57.440
And so we're all sitting around watching this thing and then at one point just four comes in and it's Rob's

51:58.040 --> 52:02.000
Well, first you get to meet Michael Cain who for no reason talks like they

52:03.040 --> 52:05.040
Michael

52:05.640 --> 52:07.640
Find that shock

52:09.480 --> 52:11.480
I'm Catherine Deneuve

52:11.520 --> 52:16.920
And I hope and it's like a orange with a feminine like kissy face on it

52:16.920 --> 52:20.320
And then the Michael Cain one is just like square glass. Yeah, he's got the

52:22.520 --> 52:30.040
The if Chris files get harder like the fucking big so they're on a boat against like this construction paper ocean

52:30.040 --> 52:32.040
That's like

52:32.040 --> 52:38.120
Like before you shut all you didn't go back and edit you're just shooting it like like I was all in camera

52:38.120 --> 52:47.120
Edits camera edits and I could hear you laughing second. I'm almost got it. I've almost got it

52:53.760 --> 52:57.000
And then the shark comes in and it's his dick

52:57.680 --> 52:59.680
And he's got a duct tape

52:59.680 --> 53:05.320
Finn on it. It's Schrab going dur dur dur dur dur dur dur and his and his pants are around his thighs

53:05.320 --> 53:09.880
And his shirts like kind of pulled up like a fucking gross porn star

53:09.880 --> 53:16.280
But your shirt the bare minimum is like going through his own construction paper ocean. It's like

53:17.480 --> 53:23.440
The duality of man-child like like like look I made a whole ocean so I give

53:24.080 --> 53:28.200
My dick is a shark. I was I was trying to get a hard on yeah

53:28.200 --> 53:33.520
But you can't you can't you halfway succeed you can't you can't fluff because you have an impressive penis

53:33.520 --> 53:37.320
And I think it's Sarah Silverman herself. So like like you should be very proud of it

53:37.320 --> 53:39.960
Yeah, but you have to mess it you can't keep a

53:41.080 --> 53:44.120
I'm kind of glad I didn't because it would have been really like

53:45.120 --> 53:52.400
Yeah, but why are you still doing that? I think I don't think it's because you can't you can't fluff yourself while you have

53:53.200 --> 53:58.080
Like you're and it was under pressure. You guys were outside in the hall, but you have a little eyeball

53:58.080 --> 54:04.680
Take like tape like I was losing the light. Yeah, you lose your light. It was it was last look. Yeah

54:07.640 --> 54:11.960
You can't fluff it when you get you you're gonna ruin the costume if you try to fucking fluff it

54:11.960 --> 54:17.240
Yeah, and so you're you're digger. I would give it like I'll say you were kind of like 40% there

54:17.240 --> 54:21.680
Yeah, right and then but then that the final is it a spoiler if I tell you what happens at the end

54:21.680 --> 54:27.540
Yeah, that's a spoiler. No, no, so at the end you hear Michael Kang

54:29.960 --> 54:31.960
And his Rob

54:32.520 --> 54:35.240
Stuffing is now mostly flaccid shark

54:35.880 --> 54:41.200
Jaws for a penis into a hole. He had cut into the orange and

54:41.840 --> 54:43.640
it's him

54:43.640 --> 54:45.640
fucking Michael in

54:45.960 --> 54:47.760
the mouth and

54:47.760 --> 54:52.400
then and then the shark withdraws from the

54:53.080 --> 54:55.080
artificially gouged

54:55.560 --> 55:01.280
Stunt stunt mouth, right? Yeah, he had he had a standby orange with a stunt mouth carved in it

55:01.280 --> 55:03.760
That would be the size. It wasn't the hero orange

55:05.760 --> 55:07.640
And so the and Rob's

55:07.640 --> 55:11.960
flaccid penis withdraws from that hole is a little bit of drip memorably

55:11.960 --> 55:19.400
in 727 20p resolution the TV cameras at the time a slight string of

55:19.920 --> 55:26.720
Either citrus or what have you like briefly connects with the subject from the object

55:26.720 --> 55:33.360
As it withdraws and and it's got cartoon eyes glued on it for its its final shot of the segment as

55:33.360 --> 55:41.880
It was my Schrabs looks at Catherine de Nouve and says mind your own business woman

55:44.320 --> 55:47.040
Finn it's the greatest work you've ever done

55:48.800 --> 55:51.720
Silverman said I want that guy to direct my pilot

55:53.800 --> 56:00.480
That was it that was it the service of the program she chose Rob to direct the service of the program off of Jaws for

56:00.480 --> 56:04.880
that yeah, and that's what started my career as a director I

56:08.000 --> 56:12.400
Forgot that yeah awesome Coda. Yeah, yeah, that's she put it in her book

56:12.400 --> 56:17.440
She put it in her book. She put it in her book. She put it in her book

56:18.400 --> 56:24.240
Yeah, nobody was on the internet yet. It was we didn't we thought it was a hole where you like through

56:24.240 --> 56:31.680
That was a bad that video was ever got in Sarah Silverman's book

56:31.680 --> 56:34.960
That video was on the internet while you are working on Lego to

56:35.560 --> 56:44.120
Yeah, which is just crazy to think about it was also and Comedy Central did this they put it on their front page

56:44.800 --> 56:50.520
Because we just for yeah, what yeah, I think somebody went. Oh, ha ha because it was on

56:50.520 --> 56:56.840
101 for some reason for a really long time and then they and then the Comedy Central

56:57.480 --> 57:01.320
Probably didn't want to they go. Oh, this is a sample of what you know

57:01.320 --> 57:05.600
Sarah looked at to get it and put it up there and then there's this comments going holy shit

57:06.360 --> 57:08.360
Not safe for work

57:12.080 --> 57:14.960
The dick is the fucking the title character

57:14.960 --> 57:23.440
Also, I love the jaws people call the shark jaws or people call Bruce Willis die hard

57:23.440 --> 57:26.440
Even though that wasn't his name. Yeah, his name was John McClane

57:26.440 --> 57:33.080
Well, the whole thing starts with jaws waking up in the morning and there's a roaster crewing and that's when you first see

57:33.360 --> 57:37.320
Rob's dick is the shark and it goes over to a half-eaten bowl

57:37.320 --> 57:44.720
A bowl of cereal only milk and a couple fruit loops in it and and Rob's dick goes. What the hell?

57:46.040 --> 57:48.920
Michael Cain ate all my cereal

57:50.600 --> 57:53.800
Wait, I'm gonna get my revenge

57:54.800 --> 57:57.920
On him because the movie was called just for the revenge

57:58.920 --> 58:03.800
So wait, who's who's the protagonist is it just for is it Michael Cain or Catherine today?

58:03.800 --> 58:11.000
Yeah, that that that that questions the one who changes the most that questions viability is the sign of art certainly does

58:11.800 --> 58:15.800
He changes from not having a dick in his mouth to having a dick in his mouth

58:17.800 --> 58:19.800
Yes, that's true

58:23.800 --> 58:27.120
Michael Cain ate all my cereal

58:27.120 --> 58:29.120
Shut up woman

58:31.720 --> 58:36.440
There's a lot of dialogue that I won't repeat because there's one thing that it's problematic in this

58:36.440 --> 58:40.600
Yeah, but I was talking to Steve Agee like Steve Agee did a channel one-on-one thing

58:40.600 --> 58:43.480
Which I won't even say tell you cuz he wants to go away

58:44.120 --> 58:45.560
We can't talk about it

58:45.560 --> 58:51.920
But it's there's something that he he cannot get off of IMDB of something that he's done that was channel one-on-one

58:51.920 --> 58:58.840
When everything was just fun and now it's like it's the kind of shit that can ruin you and he cannot

58:59.080 --> 59:01.520
He could not expunge that from history. Yeah

59:07.120 --> 59:12.800
Me but like you what was the one where you fucked the baby in the cat? Oh, that's not good again

59:12.800 --> 59:18.560
Yeah, I definitely fucked a baby in the channel one-on-one video

59:20.320 --> 59:22.320
And then they were like hey look at this

59:23.520 --> 59:26.200
And I was like, why are you making everyone look at that?

59:27.960 --> 59:34.520
Cuz you should be fired my wall. Yeah, if that's what I'm doing now

59:35.520 --> 59:37.520
Like yeah, I shouldn't work

59:38.040 --> 59:40.040
Like oh

59:40.040 --> 59:47.160
How are you doing that? Yeah, check it out. I didn't say Siri anything to turn turn your wallet off

59:49.480 --> 59:52.560
Anyways, yeah, recording fun on the Internet

59:53.560 --> 59:57.120
Somebody was actually trying to record that get you busted again

59:57.120 --> 01:00:01.600
Is TMZ here Roseanne revenge my god Roseanne got fired

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.600
Dan got Roseanne fired

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.720
They had to take action. How come you fired Roseanne?

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:11.400
They had to take action. How come you fired Roseanne? You don't fire this guy

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.440
You guys love Roseanne. Give me a break. There's a fucking liar in this room

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:23.720
Anyways, I know I'm yeah, I'm actually I was thinking it was floating in my pool today

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:28.080
How grateful I am that right right before I became like

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:35.680
Too ridiculously privileged to like be charismatic that though that I got like that send off

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:41.080
It was like no one's ever gonna like you you fucking dork and and I was like oh good

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.800
Cuz I was just getting to that point where I would have to either give to charity or feel like a monster

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:49.520
And I'm just floating in my pool going. I don't have to do anything

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.960
Everyone picked on me the whole time

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:58.240
At the net the net result I can I can leave that paper trail in my own head

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:01.400
But do you give to charity? No, you're not listening to me

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.200
I

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.200
Don't have to do anything ever

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.720
People are mean like they're mean if you're nice they're mean if you're honest they're mean if you're

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.120
People are gross and mean you don't have to love them or trust them

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:22.760
You don't have to live get up in the morning and set your watch by what they give a fuck about like they're not real

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.360
They're bad people

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.520
So if you accidentally trip over a rock and there's a million dollars under it

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:36.680
You can actually sleep like a baby that night if you don't spend it on cheeseburgers that fall from drones over the poorest neighborhood

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:41.240
I think if you use the audience can take one thing away tonight

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.400
It's whatever the fuck then just said right now

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.960
True words

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:57.800
Rob you should try pandering to Rick and Morty fans. I mean truly an example of pandering to Rick and Morty fans

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.480
Well, you guys are more adorable than mr. Poopy but

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:11.080
Literally just go like oh man, that's more helpful than mr. Meeseeks like they'll fucking lose their fuck

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.800
That's what Dan met with this switch like you just go

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.120
The gun that shoots portals and people will be like

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:25.320
Why did why did Rob get the job and not Spencer this guy fucking seems ready to roll. Yeah, why would anyone not want me to do that?

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:31.040
You're on deck man. I look I didn't I wasn't part of this meeting. I

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:36.280
Was not being serious. How did this come about who's chosen like who chose I thought Dan

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:39.680
Requested me and

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.800
No, no, who?

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:50.160
No, I who would you want? I don't know. I don't care. It was pitched to me and I was like that's fine

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:56.480
Who did it? Well, I said I said there's no such thing as a bad idea

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.600
I thought you either did you wanted me to be there with you

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:10.000
Who did who did it before you Rob? Who did last year? Yeah name the last moderate. I don't know

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.040
I don't know it's such an honor. You do know don't you where you're researching

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:18.040
I don't remember not by name, but it was just some guy Jeffrey Epstein. Oh boy

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:24.640
I didn't write I didn't wreck. I don't recognize him. He's he's on a really popular show that I don't did they do

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.960
Is that why you're doing it this time? I don't know

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:33.560
Yes, I thought you know if my friend wants me there to be with him

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.720
I'm gonna I'm gonna try to do my best to support him

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:44.280
Let's bring out Steve Levy. Yeah, get to the bottom of this Steve Levy

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:47.640
Music music

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.520
Stephen Levy

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.120
Levy

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.120
Levy

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:20.120
You're gonna crush a comic-con. I'm gonna what you're gonna crush a comic-con. God, what if I what if I do?

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.640
This could be your big break. This could be it. This could be a real fucking game changer

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Was it your pitch?

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:33.040
Unfortunately, it wasn't my pitch the network came to me and said hey

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:38.240
We've seen Rob Schrab moderate things before we really like that guy. You think he'd be interested and I said, okay

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:43.160
Well, let me check. You got fans upstairs. Well, that's good

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.720
That's good

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:49.640
So you're just tolerating my presence. I'm he always is

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.880
So

01:04:54.320 --> 01:05:01.800
Dan and Justin both approved you doing the moderation totally approved it was an accurate adjust and did and Dan

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.160
and

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:09.640
The previous moderator was the impractical one of the impractical jokers. Yeah, just some guy Quinn Brian Quinn

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:16.080
What do you do in my Martin Quinn? I want to be doing some scene into Martin Quinn

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:23.520
Is Mojo Nixon yeah, Martha Quinn

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.680
Do you know what I'm eating Martha's muffin? No, Stefan Martha's muffin by Mojo

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:37.600
I'm assuming you're talking about yeah, Stefan Martha's muffin. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Mojo. I met Mojo Nixon once in Austin, Texas

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.360
And he was everything you wanted. What are you talking about?

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:47.760
Mojo Nixon if you go Mojo Nixon if you don't get Mojo Nixon then your story could get some fixin

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:54.560
Okay, that that's a good song Elvis is everywhere. Is that a Mojo Nixon song? Oh, he's a music guy

01:05:54.560 --> 01:06:00.400
Yeah, don't look at me. I don't know. He's practicing. Who's saying punk rock girl?

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.960
That's dead milk man dead milk man. Yes

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:08.280
That one they go. We went to record store. We asked for Mojo Nixon. They said he don't work here

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:14.320
I said if you got Mojo Nixon, then your story could use some fixin. I like that song Stuart

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:19.960
By them, you know that kid Stuart, you know that it goes like that

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:25.440
That was the precursor to Rick from Rick and Morty. I think is it right? Yeah, he sounds just like him

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.840
Very good with the aliens

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:34.280
This show is taking flight. No, I know I think this is we're making fucking podcast gold

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:37.600
right you can't create your own crisis and then be the hero

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:44.680
Like if that guy with the mustache was like hey sure nobles that poorly was pretty poorly made

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:50.760
You're like you made the test go up to three Radcliffe's whatever the Radcliffe's who is your

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:59.640
How many Radcliffe's how many Radcliffe's like 2.6 Radcliffe's it's oh, that's a like there was like a

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:13.240
I think that was very interesting isn't that kind of like a funny like a bizarro DC thing where it's like, oh, yeah

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:17.880
What do we call it? We call it like what it's just a name of some dude, right?

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:22.960
Like what is it like when you the clicks that you get guy guy guy guy guy like I'm sure there's like a geiger

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:29.000
He's probably a capitalist and like they have their own geiger because nuclear energy is a modern thing

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.000
It's post like this stance, so they're not gonna you they're not gonna measure it and whatever the fuck we do

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.960
People really wear the lead song where they put the fucking found lead and make a little bit of hope so to protect their balls

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.960
Like they thought that was gonna work

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.400
To what extent is that like yeah?

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.520
I

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:55.040
Wonder if there's proper actual science to that idea that you're most vulnerable to radiation in your reproductive organs

01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:00.520
That makes sense scientifically. Yeah, it certainly couldn't hurt. I don't want to say it makes sense because I don't I think their whole body

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:07.600
Except their dick, you know, who's your favorite? Who is your favorite gravelly voice character?

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:14.200
Obviously the the the guy that looked a little bit like Bill Murray the the guy that was like

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.560
Which was a guy though the one of the three the yeah, the I like the guy who shot dogs good

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.880
And he's like don't shoot the dogs badly or I'll shoot you badly

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:31.320
Did you wonder why they needed us to shoot the dogs?

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:35.120
Well like to be part of all that I guess it was just and I'm not and I'm not digging it

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:40.640
I'm just like did you think for any part of that where you kind of like I get it because it's sort of like they're

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:46.960
Wanted they want to they want to give you a full portrait of a of a crisis that

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.320
happened because people

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:56.800
Reserved political and literal power for their control and then when that melts down if those people aren't responsible

01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:00.040
It trickles down to a fucking dog

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.920
I I didn't watch the series. Yeah, all right

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:09.320
What went up when it melts down? I listened to my roommate watch it. I

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.800
Heard so many dogs getting shot. It was really well done. I'm going out on a limb here by recommending you watch chair noble

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.960
It's very good. It's very well done. I

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:27.280
Yeah, I watched it because all of you were watching it. I'm telling you my chair noble is good. I like that quite a bit

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:33.480
Did you like the part where they shot all the dogs? No, I fast forward over it. That's what that makes sense

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:41.040
Yeah, this guy can't watch that. No, I know I can watch people fucking dying horribly, but if they yeah, well, they're asking for it

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Okay, so

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Levy yeah

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
are you still a

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.760
Good guy. I

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:57.120
I would hope so. Okay. What do Waldron's bachelor party you want to give us?

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.120
Give me give me some scandal. Yeah, we went to the

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.640
I

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.120
Don't know how

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.280
Bahamas. Yeah, we went to the Atlantis. We were in Atlantis

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:10.440
What the big-ass water park that yeah, yeah

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:15.880
The one where you see all the commercials and you go down the slides to the shark tanks that who chose that he

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:21.280
Yeah, all right. Yeah, so you there's 20 20 guys there to sell

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:25.000
Well, you went to a water park, but you know, it's all a fancy hotel

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:29.640
What but it's got the big water slide thing you go through a pyramid. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:35.360
Doesn't this water park just seems like a great way to get all the hepatitis. There was a lazy river

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:39.920
Those are so fun. It was actually pretty fun. It's like swimming without trying

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.800
Yeah, and they had like little rapids so it felt like, you know, man, that sounds

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:48.880
With the children there was it was it all is it the rapid or is it lazy?

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:52.720
I mean make up your mind river pick a lane Atlantis

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:57.240
Little rapids, but you're lazy. I mean come on

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:03.400
We were we were at the adults hotel and then there are kids

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:09.600
Yeah, the adults and where the lotion goes on. Yeah, never had a real

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:16.280
Uh-uh jealousy of the people on the lazy river at the hotels that boast those

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:20.840
Yeah, but I do like the concept. I wouldn't take it away from anybody, right?

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:25.960
I'd really like to go on an inner tube actual river thing where it wasn't a lazy river

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:31.760
Because actually ironically I think that would play on a lot of my social anxieties because it's not lazy in terms of like

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:39.440
If you're going on a figure eight around a hotel, like you're like am I I'm on the lazy river, but like where's Kyle?

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.840
You know Kyle was on the lazy river

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.200
Am I gonna be uncool if I like

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:52.480
Back splash so I slow down for Kyle and he's gonna be like dude. It's a lazy river. Don't be clingy

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:58.560
Yeah, you know like like and oh do I knew am I supposed to speed ahead and maybe I'll lap Kyle and then like

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:04.640
I actually had a business trip. There's eight kiles and then you're like who why this is no lazy

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:07.600
Yeah, this is an exercise and we got shot down at different times

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.720
So I actually was like oh am I gonna are they gonna get too far ahead of me?

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:17.880
I paddled but for some reason in my mind that would be way more doable if you're on our actual river because then it's like

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.120
You'd be like oh man

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.680
I'm way behind or I'm way ahead and there is no like kind of you're like well

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:32.840
That's that's analogous to is it lazy all year long. I mean like if like there was a CSI in Miami

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:40.640
Where the a shark from one of the shark tank at one resort casino

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:45.760
Somehow ended up in the lazy river of another casino hotel

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.720
That was the that was the cold open call in shark attack in the lazy river

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:56.480
It's like one of the sharks was transplanted into what from one casino what show was this other?

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:59.360
I think it was CSI Miami because it was like there's no way a shark

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:05.280
Right then he ended like going like looks like you know, I don't know what he would have said

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.240
We're gonna need a bigger. We're gonna need a lazier lazier boat

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.600
Yeah

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:16.720
But I was like wow now I get what if this if this is every episode of this fucking show

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:21.240
Oh, but wait was in Las Vegas if why was CSI Miami in Las Vegas?

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.040
Never mind

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:28.120
Probably a different show. Why was it? Why did the Brady Bunch go to Hawaii? It's fucking

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.280
Tower in Las Vegas. Hello. Why did the

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:36.800
golfer wear two pairs of pants in case he got a hole in one

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:43.000
What damn he was ready for that. Oh well

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:50.680
Oh, yeah, how is how is y'all's fourth of July? Did you guys talk about that talk about that earthquake?

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.960
We didn't talk about either of those things talking about no earthquake

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:58.200
Rollin earthquake man ready for that big one seven point one one

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:02.600
I I spent all day. I spent all morning Saturday going through

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.080
Kate and I's emergency kits

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.520
Where did I do? Where did you keep your emergency kit damn?

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:16.040
I'll tell you what my emergency kids I got a gun. I'll shoot the danger. I'll shoot the

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.560
Tectonics

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.360
Shoot him with my gun

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.600
Hello earthquake

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:29.400
Never shoot seven point one. I got a 45. I'm gonna shoot you

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.760
Seven point one shoot you and right

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.760
I'm the

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.560
You guys laugh but Dan has so much water stored up

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.640
Like you're gonna run out of your fucking bags of water in like 20 minutes

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.720
but isn't all that water like just

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:53.880
Unhealthy because it's like been sitting there in five gallon plastic jugs forever. Yes. Oh, yeah

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:57.240
You'll certainly die of cancer instead of in the apocalypse

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.360
I'll be the I'll be an old man on the porch telling us and as before the

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:06.680
Uh, new california republic started their double reconstruction

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:11.480
Like but I'll have like a tumor the size of an eggplant in my shoulder from drinking like

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:14.680
You can take your gun out and shoot your cancer

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
They say there's the two kinds of earthquakes

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:25.800
I was saying that was fucking good, man. Oh, thank you. That was a fucking solid

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:31.320
You are so you're gonna burn you're gonna rock it at the fucking comic con

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:37.960
Thanks. Thank you so much nail it. Thank you so much. You are fucking killing it, bro. Man. Thank you. You're leaving it

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:43.160
You're killing killing it. Thank you. I don't know. Thank you

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:47.080
They say there's two kinds of earthquakes

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:50.520
There's like the rumbling rolling thing where you're like sitting there swaying

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:54.600
Which is the only kind I've ever experienced because I got here just after the north ridge quake

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.320
And the but the north ridge quake

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:03.320
Is the other kind right jolter where it just goes boom and like you're like people fly out of their beds

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:09.160
You were around for that. What was that like? Oh, man. What was that like for you, man? Dude, I would fucking own that one

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.400
Yeah, right

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.800
Tell me tell us of the north ridge quake. Yeah

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:19.160
What what what time of day was it was it nighttime or daytime? Well, we weren't here yet, huh?

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.560
Daytime there was one where I was in the shower and nearly broke my neck where I

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:28.760
Like it jolted and I like the completely like took a spill in the shower

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:35.720
And got up and it just everything was just warping and bending. That was a fucking bad one. That might have been north ridge

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.120
That would suck that would suck. No, no, no, that was the wittier narrows

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:44.840
I lived in wittier for the wittier narrows one and that was like we were pretty close to the epicenter of that one

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.240
and uh

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:49.240
I remember driving to

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.880
school that day

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.880
And I looked at

01:16:53.960 --> 01:17:00.360
Buildings and all the glass and the windows was just waving. It was really wild. No, okay answer some

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.680
No

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:13.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:16.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:18.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.060
God, that was a no.

01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:22.500
What's that, sir?

01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:26.840
These fucking stools are the most uncomfortable.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.260
They didn't give you pieces of shit.

01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:29.960
You suck at this as a shit.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:33.400
You fucking terrible fucking, give me a stool.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:34.360
Listen to these things.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:37.680
70 episodes can't get cushions on the goddamn chair.

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:40.360
We probably took those from like the other show.

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.200
We've always used those.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:44.640
Nobody's supposed to be sitting in those longer than an hour.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:45.480
All right, go ahead, Dan.

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:46.320
What are you saying?

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.360
A high chair for pain.

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:50.640
Well, here's a new segment.

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:55.840
It's called Dan Harmon's Earthquake Suppositions.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:56.800
Music stink.

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:57.800
Music stink.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:04.800
Dan Harmon's Earthquake Suppositions.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.800
Yeah.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:10.800
Dan Harmon's Earthquake Suppositions.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.800
Yeah, you know.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.600
Yeah.

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:16.320
OK, all right.

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.000
Good theme song.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.720
I think this segment's going to be coming back just for the.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:21.800
Yeah, this already has legs.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:22.800
It might be one of those.

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.960
We'll end it.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.560
We'll end the segment, too.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.360
Here's a couple of things in my old age

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.960
that I've come to assume about earthquakes.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.240
Number one.

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.000
How many are there, by the way?

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:33.560
I don't know.

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:34.320
I don't know.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.360
Sorry.

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.760
But we can say seven.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.520
And if I got a riff, you want to count it down.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:41.680
You want to count it up from one, two, two.

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.360
Let's do seven.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:46.360
Dan Harmon's seven Earthquake Suppositions.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.360
Hit it, Zach.

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:52.360
Dan Harmon's seven Earthquake Suppositions.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:56.200
Do you ever have six suppositions about something?

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.000
Guess what?

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.560
You just got a plus one.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.800
Earthquake Suppositions.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.560
Yo.

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.880
My name is Mad Dog Johnson.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.720
I just got out of the joint.

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:10.000
I'm going to rake.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.400
What?

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.040
Why did they let Mad Dog Johnson out?

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.960
Wait, what was Mad Dog Johnson in for?

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:18.800
I don't know.

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.600
But was it rape?

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.960
I think if you were listening to that theme song,

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.440
I think what you heard is commonly known in the audio

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:30.120
industry is that was a glitch where you're actually hearing

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:34.760
a tail on a recording session, where sometimes the theme song

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:38.280
for a segment actually also was used by a record label

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:43.480
for what they call walk-ins.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:47.240
And I guess the Mad Dog Johnson, I guess you heard a little more

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.680
than we bargained for.

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:51.800
When you buy your segment themes in bulk,

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:57.120
you end up with a couple pig anuses in your calamari.

01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:00.080
The cheaper it is, the more it is, the same shape.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.040
And then it's like, I guess that's what we were hearing there.

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.680
And I don't know if it'll be in the final edit.

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:07.920
But yeah, I have the same questions as you.

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:09.200
Why did they let him out?

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.360
How did he make parole?

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.200
Why was he?

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:15.960
I'll put myself on the shoes of Mad Dog Johnson.

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.760
If I've just gotten released from prison,

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:21.280
I'm certainly not going to rap about.

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.560
I think my upcoming rape.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.200
And that's the other question, of course,

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.760
is that what he said?

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.560
I'm going to.

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.520
It was kind of solid.

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.120
No, it's certainly what he said.

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.480
It's Mad Dog Johnson.

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:35.760
Was he like second guessing it?

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:39.600
The thing is, I actually just went through the court files.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.840
Raise up my marriage.

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.120
He was only in prison for tax fraud.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:47.600
But he got institutionalized, and now he's

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.360
going to go out and commit a series of horrible crimes.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.800
That's why it's important to know what he was in for.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.200
Because we don't want to judge convicts if they got out.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.920
But if he was in for tax evasion,

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.880
and he got out for good behavior,

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:01.680
then there's probably a misunderstanding happening here.

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.520
Mad Dog Johnson.

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:05.280
He just admitted he was going to go rape people.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:10.080
But if he was in for murder, and he wasn't supposed to get out.

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.360
Yeah, it informs everything.

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.200
Yeah, well, look.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.200
Revolving door.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.800
We buy in volume here.

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.680
All right, so anyway.

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:20.960
The segment is Dean Harmon's Top 7 Earthquake Suppositions.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:24.160
Top 7 Earthquake Suppositions.

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.280
All right, number 7.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:25.960
Number 7.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:30.520
We're coming in at number 7, Dan Harmon's Top 7

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:33.040
Earthquake Suppositions.

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.480
I suppose.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.560
This is number 7.

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:35.880
Yeah.

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.920
OK.

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:45.240
That if you're going to die in an earthquake

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:48.120
by something falling on top of you,

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:51.120
that that's also how you're going to wake up.

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:58.720
In my 30s, I was very scared about, oh god, the big earthquake.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.720
And it's like, oh my god, shit can fall on you.

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:05.480
And now in my 40s, I'm kind of like, wait a minute.

01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:06.880
There's two kinds of earthquakes.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.920
There's like rock and roll.

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.520
And those are damaging.

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:13.120
We see the grocery stores and like the fucking regus

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.880
falling everywhere.

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:18.720
Fatalities can occur in the rolling thunder thing.

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.920
I mean, that is a huge amount of fucking motion and energy.

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:23.480
When I think of all the lost ragu.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.760
But the earthquakes that result in, I think,

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:32.320
in disasters like global, where things are collapsed.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.200
This is my supposition, because I didn't research it at all.

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:43.720
This is my supposition, is that those society profits.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:46.280
We have six more of these, you guys.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.280
Six more.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.840
Who made that fucking straw sound?

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.520
Who did that?

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:57.080
Who went, come on, own it and say, OK, was that critical?

01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:00.840
Or were you kind of like, I don't want to tell you what

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:05.120
to tell me, but if you can just pretend that it was saying.

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.040
Nobody did anything.

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.760
No, he's raising his finger.

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:13.960
He's being, we're, and it was like, it's OK if it was mostly.

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.760
Can you do the sound again, because I missed it.

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:16.480
I missed it, too.

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:17.240
Yeah, OK.

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:19.440
Half of that's a lot of drinking.

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:22.960
That's what I wanted to hear, is that I'll own one half of it.

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.160
Is that you were kind of like, Jesus Christ,

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.400
this fucking fat idiot.

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:30.080
But I want you to just pallbear the other half,

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.960
where you're like, also, I've had a lot of coronas.

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.600
I'm like, I don't need this.

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.680
Yeah, fucking bros, see?

01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:36.280
OK.

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:37.320
I just needed that.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.320
What was the sound that you heard?

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.200
All right, let me get back to my fucking thing.

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.320
It was like an exhale.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.440
I think that in an earthquake that's

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:45.560
going to fucking kill you by dropping shit on your head,

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.520
I'm not saying don't prepare for earthquakes.

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.600
I'm just saying, in a nihilistic sense,

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.040
I think what they're not telling us

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.200
is that when the earthquake's that big,

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.560
like no amount of shoes and flashlights next to your bed

01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:00.760
are going to stop you from having a cinder block on your head.

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:04.080
That is how you wake up in an earthquake that kills you,

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.640
is the thing that kills you.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.880
You're waking up dead because the cinder block is on you?

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.640
And I say that optimistically, because I think

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:15.800
a lot of our worst nightmares are thoughts of where people

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.520
are like, because we hear survivors' horror stories.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.480
Number six.

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:21.480
OK.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:22.680
Thank you.

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:23.920
And now are we?

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:28.360
Because you're sobering me up, and you're moving it on,

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.240
and we're like, yeah, we need each other.

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:33.680
I could use a guy to kick my ass around here.

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.800
And it should be my shadow self.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.160
I can only see your silhouette, but you're basically

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.840
me, except you're less afraid of the color turquoise.

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.560
Like, that's all I know about you.

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.880
Like, I'm just like, I could never take that risk.

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:51.440
Like, that's too outgoing.

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:52.880
And you're like, I'm not on stage.

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:53.560
I don't care.

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:54.360
Turquoise.

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:56.400
Give me a turquoise shirt, you fuck.

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:56.880
I'm kidding.

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.040
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:59.920
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.400
Is it even turquoise or are we kidding?

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.640
I'm kidding.

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:04.320
Number six.

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.760
OK, number six.

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:06.880
Fuck, I think I'm out of them.

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:11.880
OK, all right, number six.

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:14.760
You can do a speed round from six to two.

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.960
Number six, there's no such thing as earthquake weather.

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:17.640
That's not a thing.

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:18.360
That's pop size.

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:18.880
Number five.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:25.360
Number five, the thing that you really need to be afraid of

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.560
is called liquefaction.

01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:32.320
It's when you're in a moisture area, then dry,

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.960
because earthquakes can then create instant quicksand that

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:40.520
will suck your body or house or golf cart instantly down.

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.920
Or golf cart.

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:43.120
Into the earth.

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:47.440
And as quickly as it happens, the dirt reconstitutes this dirt.

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:51.400
You are fucking Han Solo'd alive.

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:53.360
And it's going to happen to Portland.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:56.400
I think Han Solo was Han Solo'd alive, too.

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.480
OK, well, that's just a supposition.

01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:58.520
Number four.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:03.400
Number four, earthquakes.

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:04.240
Number three.

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:13.400
OK, we're sipping along now.

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:14.520
I almost breathed out.

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:18.160
Earthquakes are like when people start worrying about

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:27.160
aftershocks, as long as the next one isn't bigger, you're done.

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.600
If the first one didn't destroy anything,

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:33.880
and then the second one is smaller than the first one,

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:36.560
take that string off the back of your TV.

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:39.600
Fucking ride bareback for a while.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.680
Well, watch HBO with like a fucking unearthquake proof TV.

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.520
What the fuck is the string on a TV?

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.520
Who puts a string on a TV?

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:49.160
You guys don't have an earthquake proof TV.

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:54.560
I've never been more embarrassed for you in my life.

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.880
You have a string on your TV?

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:59.520
You're supposed to tell him to fuck no, but I'm just.

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.040
All right.

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.800
OK, but this guy started the sentence by meowing earlier,

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:06.560
so I'm not going to fucking take earthquake prep.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.880
There was an earthquake, and then remember when they said,

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:12.720
like, that was a foreshock, not an aftershock,

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.080
because the next one was bigger.

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.120
Yeah.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:18.120
And we were like, fuck, that was the time to panic,

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:20.920
because it was like, is this a foreshock?

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.160
It could be.

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:24.280
We won't know until the next one's even bigger.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.280
Where do you put this?

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.840
But if the next one's smaller, you

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:34.680
can jump into a lattice of jumper cables

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:39.720
that are all gingerly arranged to only make contact

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:41.520
with the leads that touch your body.

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.400
Where do you put the string on the TV,

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.960
and what are you putting the string?

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.560
You're supposed to just anchor your tippable furniture

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:51.080
to the wall with a screw and a stud.

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:54.880
This is especially for people that have kids and pets,

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:59.280
like because a relatively non-disasterous earthquake

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:04.320
can tip a bookcase, which can be a, this isn't funny, Steve.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.760
I'm looking at Spencer.

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:07.320
He's leading it.

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:10.000
Wait, what?

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.560
I'm not, this isn't easy to agree with, you.

01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:15.560
I do nothing.

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:18.720
I've had a great time.

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:24.200
Number two, we are two away from the Dan Harmon's top seven

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:25.360
suppositions about earthquakes.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:30.480
Dying.

01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:36.720
And the number one earthquake supposition.

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:49.840
The important things to have for an earthquake have less,

01:28:49.840 --> 01:29:00.360
you should have condoms and a lot of shoes.

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.360
I truly think a gun is a good thing,

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:05.000
because then you just roll into a fucking store

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.680
and be like, give me all the stuff.

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:08.480
It's an earthquake.

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:10.840
I need this for my family.

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:12.840
Have you ever fired your gun, actually?

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:13.480
No.

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:15.200
He's afraid that it'll explode.

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.000
I cleaned it.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.240
It's a deadly weapon.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:21.120
It's supposed to explode out the barrel.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:21.760
Right.

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:22.240
That's what my.

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:23.840
You're afraid that you cleaned it wrong?

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:24.480
You might have.

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:26.520
I'm saying cleaned it wrong.

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.240
Why did you clean it if you haven't fired it?

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:30.880
I always wanted to clean a gun.

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:32.200
I never wanted to fire one.

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:36.520
What kind of gun is it?

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:37.120
It's a Glock.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.960
Clean.

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.000
And broken, I'm sure of it.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.720
Clean and dangerous.

01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:48.440
All right, number one earthquake supposition,

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:51.200
I just learned that gas lines have

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:52.880
earthquake sensors on them.

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.320
Yeah.

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.680
Dan's hot water went out, and we didn't know why.

01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:00.240
And I called a guy, and he was like,

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.720
I'm going to check your earthquake sensor.

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.600
And I was like, the what now?

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.360
And he's like, yeah, all these houses,

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:07.000
they got earthquake sensors on them.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.520
And I was like, well, that's the great idea, actually.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.960
And it turns out that the electronics guys

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:17.440
were jackhammering or some such on the outside walkway

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:18.880
to lay some cable.

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:23.240
And that tremor sensation tripped the earthquake sensor

01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:25.000
and turned off the gas to the house.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.680
It didn't turn off with the earthquake sensors.

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:30.400
Imagine those poor earthquake sensors.

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:30.880
Yeah.

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:34.760
That story, those guys, imagine that Pixar movie.

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:38.280
Earthquake sensors, exclamation point.

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.680
Did you know earthquake sensors have a secret world

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:43.760
of their own?

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:46.280
And there's a one for one analogy of a lot of the problems

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:47.840
that you and I have.

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:52.520
And Tony earthquake sensor is like the earthquake sensor

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:53.600
that cried wolf.

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:58.360
He's like, guys, guys, there's an earthquake.

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:01.840
And it's like, wha wha, as the Randy Newman song starts,

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:05.000
it's like a reveal that yet again, it's just a guy installing

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.760
cable, oh, you got a tender touch.

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:12.200
Oh, you got a sensitivity.

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:16.520
Oh, you're the first to know about my love for you

01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:20.000
because, you know, you got a hair trigger for you

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.480
and you for me.

01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:24.320
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:27.320
Oh, the Council of Earthquake Sensor Elders

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:31.400
will now review the case of Tony once again.

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.400
Eye roll, eye roll, eye roll.

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.280
I'm a professional sensor, and I'm

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:38.520
picking up on your eye rolls.

01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:40.920
Yeah, that's not ironic.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.960
You pick up on, yeah, OK, never mind.

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:45.280
We'll workshop that bit.

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.800
We should pick up on more stuff.

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.360
Yes, we should have less of an eye roll.

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.560
Yes, OK, fucking, let's be on the same team.

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:54.640
Tony, come forth and explain yourself.

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:56.560
Hey, guys, come sorry.

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.440
Look, I really thought the earth was shaking

01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:00.320
and my job was to turn off the gas.

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:03.080
Who was celebrities voicing Tony?

01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:03.800
Bill Hader.

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:05.560
Bill Hader, all right.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:09.800
And then they're like, Tony, we sentence you

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:14.760
to re-education camp.

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.440
You will follow the unused gas lines that run underneath.

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:21.000
Oh, dear.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.800
So I'm sorry.

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:26.040
When I hear camp and gas, I went to, yeah.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:26.600
No, you should.

01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.600
This thing is not here to.

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.320
Yeah, it's not called show friends.

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.160
Yeah, OK, OK.

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.360
Go ahead.

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.240
It's Pixar.

01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:37.600
You weren't a character in the movie.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:40.800
You were like the producer watching a screen test.

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:45.440
Oh, I'm Jack Wapke going, whoa, boy.

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.520
Holy shit, why didn't we catch that?

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:49.280
My family died in the Holocaust.

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:51.560
Yikes.

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:52.880
I'm so proud of it.

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:55.360
There's a deep cut, but there was a community season

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.440
that was on Yahoo.

01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.040
And there was like an episode where

01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:01.240
like Steve Gutenberg played this guy that was like a producer.

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.800
And there was this whole thing about this movie

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.520
Abed made, and my favorite thing was that there's

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:08.560
the second act that is like Steve Gutenberg

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:11.440
guys, this producer character watching on a laptop,

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:13.560
the kind of like the Abed movie.

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.560
And I just love like the discovery of like,

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.160
he should be really into it.

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:18.000
Like there's nothing.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.400
The story doesn't have to turn on him being like,

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:24.720
he's like, he's like, we just got all these like reactions

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:27.880
from Gutenberg like watching this movie that Abed made.

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:30.160
And he's just like, oh, oh, oh, God.

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.600
And it's just to me, it's really funny

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.480
because it's vulnerable and funny.

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:36.080
It's like comedy where it's like everybody wins.

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.320
Like he's really into the movie.

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:42.480
So what is the Tony, the sensor act one?

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.720
Well, OK, so I want to do a little retconning here

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.800
because I got a little, it's like,

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:49.080
I think they sentenced him to be like a sprinkler

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:50.640
sensor or something.

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:53.880
And he, but then there's an actual emergency.

01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:55.480
So there's a real earthquake.

01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:56.800
And no one will listen to him.

01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:57.640
We know that story.

01:33:57.640 --> 01:33:58.800
Because he's cried wolf to me.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.040
But then because of where he is positioned,

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:04.280
like, so he's been sent to be a sprinkler sensor.

01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:08.760
And he, so he is actually privy to the fact

01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:09.960
that an earthquake is coming.

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:12.640
So these are like a fun like action movie thing,

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:15.640
like what's it called, San Fernando with the Rock

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:16.680
or whatever he's like going.

01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:17.200
San Andreas.

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:22.960
Yeah, it's like, he's, I thought it was more local.

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:24.240
San Fernando.

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.520
With the Rock.

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:27.200
The decommissioned roller rink is not

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:30.240
going to have enough arugula unless I rescue my girlfriend.

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:33.960
I've got to get past this film development lab.

01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:35.400
San Fernando jokes.

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:45.720
It's a movie that introduced the world to San Fernando

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.560
Boulevard culture.

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:50.240
San Fernando Boulevard.

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.120
That famous Boulevard.

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:53.680
All right.

01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:54.560
Street, what is it?

01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.960
What are you?

01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:59.400
So now there's a real emergency.

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:00.840
He works now as a sprinkler sensor.

01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:02.320
So there's an earthquake coming.

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.640
And it's like the earthquake has to,

01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.200
I do not want to do a Bugs Life here,

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:08.200
because I stopped watching Bugs Life when it was like, wait,

01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:11.600
you mean the fucking protagonist caused the problem?

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:12.920
Like, that's going to send him.

01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:16.480
And that's like, like, like, like, no, I don't know likey.

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:19.640
Like, I was like, I'm not going to watch a bunch of bugs

01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.560
go through a lot of shit that challenges them,

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:25.480
because Dave Foley's character did something wrong

01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:27.320
and then was like, guess we got to do a thing now.

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:28.880
Well, yeah, clean up your messes, baby.

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:30.240
Isn't that like risky business?

01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:32.240
Didn't Tom Cruise do something wrong

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.680
and he had to fix his own problem?

01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:35.080
No.

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:36.000
No, sir.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
No.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000
No.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.960
No, Tom Cruise is risky business.

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:44.320
His parents are leaving and they're like, be a good boy

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:45.000
or whatever he's.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.160
I mean, his thing has nothing to do with it.

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:49.760
He creates a crisis of his own design

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:52.760
and has to grow up and fix his own problem, doesn't he?

01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:58.360
Yeah, but he didn't like make his parents leave town.

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.640
But maybe that's why they left town,

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.280
because I fucking want to hang out with Tom Cruise

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:04.200
all the fucking time.

01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:09.160
That would be a less enjoyable story.

01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:10.160
That's why.

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:12.440
I was like, oh, he fucked up.

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:13.640
I've never seen Bugs Life.

01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:16.560
What did Dave Foley do in Bugs Life that created his own problem?

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:20.760
I feel like he like forgot to put out the grasshopper bird

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:21.240
seeds.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.480
No, no, they're collecting all the food.

01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:26.080
And then he fucked it all up and all went into the river.

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.920
Yeah, it's like, you dumb fuck.

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:31.520
And then he's like, well, boy, I guess I got to be willow now.

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:33.200
You're not willow?

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:34.680
God damn.

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:36.240
All right, anyways, whatever.

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.560
OK, so stick with me.

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:40.960
You'll write a million movies.

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:41.840
I suck.

01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:43.120
I suck worse than anything.

01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:45.040
That's why I'm so cynical.

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.200
All right, can we get back to what we were talking about?

01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:48.680
Sprinkler sensor, now we've got.

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.760
OK, so the sprinkler sensor, like, yeah.

01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:52.200
Oh, I want to be careful here, because I

01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:54.200
want to make sure you resonate with this character.

01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:55.800
You want them to be like.

01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.920
He's been demoted from earthquake sensor.

01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:59.320
So they know the earthquake's coming.

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.920
And then it's like, they fuck.

01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:03.840
I mean, we've got to put a pin in some stuff here.

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:08.160
But I'd skip to the idea that what ends up happening,

01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:09.800
because I like this device I created,

01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:14.320
is there's like an ancient, there's a lower tech.

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:19.320
Back when California was still being tamed.

01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:20.840
Excuse my belching.

01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:25.880
There was like, the water and the gas

01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:29.960
and the used to come in the same tubes.

01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:33.600
And there was less room for alarm.

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:37.480
It's like a regression to a more primitive world.

01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:39.360
And you got John Houston from Chinatown.

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.280
He's talking about how like.

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:48.280
It's like flushed away meets Chinatown, meets Rango.

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.080
What's the guy?

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:50.640
What's the lizard?

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:51.880
Yeah, yeah.

01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:53.040
Johnny Depp played Rango.

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:57.560
That had some problems that you could fix with this.

01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:59.040
I like the tone.

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.640
And then he's like, oh man, I can't believe I'm in a deeper

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:03.040
tube.

01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:05.720
So now that he's been demoted from high tech

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.760
to more analog, more old tech.

01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:10.840
But that puts him more in touch with the actual.

01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:12.160
So he just wants to contribute.

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:15.320
So he's like always going like, hey, something's shaking.

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.520
And they're always telling him, hey, pick your battles.

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.960
Your job's not to like rock the boat.

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.920
And he's like, but I'm an earthquake sensor.

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.920
And they're like, yeah, you can't just see earthquakes

01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:24.560
everywhere.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.640
So then a real earthquake, I think

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:29.120
it's got to be him actually being like, oh,

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.360
that can't be an earthquake.

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.120
And for that reason, he bothers to show up for work

01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:34.080
and no one else does.

01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:37.480
So there's like a kind of Simon Peggy kind of like,

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:40.040
shot of the dead thing where you're like, he's naive.

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:42.040
For a segment, you're kind of like, oh, that poor guy,

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:46.400
he doesn't know that there's been an evacuation, home alone.

01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:50.360
And so that's why he ends up like the only earthquake sensor

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:56.720
in a community where it really needs to be sensed.

01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:00.880
What's the meeting with the goddess here?

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:05.080
Where are we at in the story arc right now?

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:06.440
I mean, the meeting of the goddess

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.120
is he senses an earthquake, isn't it?

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:11.720
I think it's that he senses the destruction

01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:15.800
of a new unlikely family that he builds in a new community.

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:17.600
So you have to think about, what is

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:19.960
the opposite of an earthquake sensor, aesthetically,

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:23.200
and maybe not, if not purposefully?

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.800
There's no such thing as an earthquake sensor

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:29.640
on the earthquake side.

01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:31.320
Earthquakes don't have their own sensors.

01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:32.520
An earthquake sensor?

01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:33.040
Yeah.

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.440
Could there be a character that is the earthquake?

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.720
Can you anthropomorphize the actual earthquake?

01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:38.600
It could be earthquake.

01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:41.680
Like fern gully.

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:43.280
Well, you could in the form of someone

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:45.320
with a mental disorder that was like

01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:47.520
a human earthquake, like a character earthquake.

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:49.320
They're unpredictable.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.400
They're uncontrollable.

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:52.800
And so what our protagonist is learning

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:56.960
is it's not about the false dichotomy of alarmism

01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:58.720
versus stagnation.

01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:01.520
It's about mirroring and sensitivity.

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:06.120
He needs to become a person's sensor.

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:10.920
And when he thinks that there is a crisis,

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:14.040
it's true, but it's not a zero sum game in terms

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.760
of whether or not everyone needs to do something.

01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:19.560
He needs to realize that he's the most sensitive earthquake

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:21.320
sensor of all.

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:24.640
But there has to be something that he was not sensitive to,

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:27.360
that he has to become more sensitive to about himself

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.560
or about somebody that's important to him.

01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:31.240
His own self-esteem, maybe?

01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:32.080
Maybe, yeah.

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:34.160
Yeah.

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:37.640
Or maybe like his mother or some other character.

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:41.880
He realized that my job is to be sensitive,

01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:45.560
and yet look how insensitive I've been to the people that

01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:46.520
matter most to me.

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:49.840
I told Spencer today that my therapist asked

01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:53.320
me to start taking showers.

01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:55.400
We got the same, me and Dan have the same therapist.

01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:57.040
We're at the same wall in therapy now.

01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.560
He started seeing my therapist.

01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:01.600
But my therapist is like a super person that I was like,

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:02.960
man, she saved my life.

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.480
But I think she's just hitting that wall

01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:06.600
because she's like, god, damn, this dude's perfect,

01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.320
except he's fucking dirty and gross.

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.680
We've got nothing, no bubble left to pop.

01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:14.360
Well, she's saying, because I have another client coming in,

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:16.200
and you need to start taking showers,

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:17.720
or I have to start buying more for breeze.

01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:18.800
It started with a UTI conversation,

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:20.600
where I was like, I got a UTI, and she's kind of like,

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:22.560
what were you at, a fucking weird public pool

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.400
in the middle of a fucking dump?

01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.600
And I was like, well, I don't know how I got a UTI,

01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:29.640
and she's going to like, how many showers do you take?

01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:31.000
I was kind of like, where's this going?

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.640
God damn.

01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:33.960
Can I ask how many showers you take?

01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:35.800
I take a shower every time I work out.

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.360
I work out every other day.

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.120
That is 10,000 times more showers

01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.280
than I ever have taken in my life.

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:43.520
Because there's been times when you've gone weeks and months

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:44.360
without a shower.

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:45.560
And people are shocked by that.

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:47.520
And then I started working out, and I'm like, oh, now

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:48.520
I don't mind taking a shower.

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:50.400
Because after a workout, I'm like, jeez,

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.080
I don't want this to be the case.

01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:57.560
And then I have this almost inarticulable outrage

01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:59.360
that I know is now unfashioned anymore.

01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:03.440
But it's this idea of people being like,

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:07.800
it's OK that you're fascinated by like, oh, what?

01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:10.120
You don't want to take a shower.

01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:12.280
But will you just like fucking think

01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:15.760
about how much you want to take a shower, which is probably

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:17.360
a lot if you're doing it all the time,

01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.600
and that's not an accomplishment?

01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:22.560
You're not like fucking disciplined.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.960
Fuck you, you fucking shower addict.

01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:27.160
You're just a fucking shower person.

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.000
You don't get a medal for that.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.960
But you also don't get shit on it for that.

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:33.440
I'm never like fucking shower people.

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:36.560
Actually, problematically enough, as I was developing,

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:39.160
yeah, I was like fucking shower people,

01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.680
which is like that's a whammy you

01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:43.600
don't want to put on a guy that can fucking hurt you or help

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:44.100
you.

01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:48.200
And now I'm like, I think it's like I'm working out

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:48.720
every other day.

01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:50.680
So I'm like, this is like a million times more showers

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:51.560
than I've ever taken.

01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:54.760
And now my therapist is like, she's like,

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.720
I'm trying to explain to her.

01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:59.600
I'm like, look, man, if you're hanging out,

01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:01.440
you know if you wake up in the morning

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:03.520
and you're like, I can't believe my body's

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:08.360
been in this dirty bed for eight hours.

01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:11.360
I'm so proud of you for feeling that way

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:14.000
about your dirt level when you wake up.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:20.120
And I'm so extra proud of you for like having that carrying

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:25.480
you like a fucking black stallion to the fucking Kentucky

01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:27.000
Derby.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.400
Your destiny lies in you going into your tiled room

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:32.880
of your choosing and turning that knob

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:35.280
and just rubbing that water all over you.

01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:38.640
I mean, wow, I mean, if you're not a fucking hero,

01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:40.120
I don't know who is.

01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:42.240
Wait a minute, I'm being sarcastic.

01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:44.000
Shower in my sarcasm.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.000
It's as available as the fucking water

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.400
that you are not remarkable for desiring

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:51.440
to be cascading over you.

01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:53.760
I find it to be fucking weird.

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:58.120
I'm like, if I haven't wrestled with a turd

01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:00.920
in the last eight hours, I'm waking up in a clean bed.

01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:03.520
Wrestled with a turd?

01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:05.040
You've never wrestled with a turd?

01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:06.120
I didn't jog.

01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:07.920
I'm not feeling dirty.

01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:10.120
I'm not doing this thing.

01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:14.280
And I'm like, it's just, I'm not, it's not, it feels,

01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:17.120
I'm going to go into this cold tiled room, which

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:20.600
looks like the jigsaw room.

01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:23.880
Everything's tile and it's clinical.

01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:25.920
Your dogs don't go in the bathroom.

01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:26.720
You know why?

01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:29.600
It's like a vet's office.

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:32.720
You never said to your dog, get out of the bathroom.

01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:34.840
Your dog has a natural aversion to the bathroom.

01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:37.160
They're like, that seems like where you get cut open.

01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:39.280
But your new house has some really beautiful.

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:40.960
Yeah, and I'll probably take a million showers,

01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:42.320
and then I'll be president.

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.720
And that'll make me a great person.

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:46.840
You've like, the jig is up, people.

01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:48.640
I know you're full of shit.

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:51.680
I really think, I really think people who take showers

01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:53.920
are more disciplined, though.

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:56.840
Like, I think out of all the things that you could say,

01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:58.600
I think they're definitely, it's like, you know,

01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:01.040
the military, it's like, oh, you got to make your bed

01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.040
when you get up at, like, I think it really is,

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.800
like, this regimen that they're, like, resigned to.

01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:07.760
They just have good habits.

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:08.600
Right, yeah.

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:09.440
That's what discipline is.

01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:11.360
It's a habit, it's a good, yeah.

01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:13.200
So it's like, who fucking cares?

01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:16.040
So I got a habit that looks different from your habit,

01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:18.000
but then the people with the, they're like,

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.960
so don't you think you, don't you think maybe you're,

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:24.800
you don't have my habits because you're unhappy?

01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:27.760
That could very well be true, man.

01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:30.600
Like, I, like, that's definitely worth peeking into.

01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:34.200
Let's talk about neglect and, like, I assume, like,

01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:37.560
like, maybe taking your body into a fucking weird

01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:40.240
operating room and, like, spraying it with water,

01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:42.200
just so you can, like, dry it back off,

01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:45.080
get on the bus and have a fucking dude with a crew cut

01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:47.920
go, like, whoa, fucking, like,

01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:51.400
nerd faggot took a shower, dude, gimme five.

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:54.480
Man, I, I, like,

01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:58.920
I'm positive that the fact that I'm not into that,

01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:02.160
like, means I'm unhappier than you.

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:04.480
I, like, great.

01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:05.720
Unpack it, it will.

01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:09.600
But, like, but, like, stop patting yourself on the back.

01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:10.960
Wait, did you just say stop?

01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:11.960
He said Schrab.

01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:12.880
Oh, Schrab.

01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:14.240
Well, fuck you for saying either.

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:16.560
Like, that's a weird, or anything.

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:19.160
Like, it's just saying ketchup would be a bad idea.

01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:20.160
That would be better.

01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:23.000
Is it the act of starting the shower

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.640
and crossing that threshold, like,

01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:27.560
the effort it takes to start the process

01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:28.400
of getting into a shower?

01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:29.240
Yeah.

01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:30.600
Or is it, or do you not like the actual.

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.160
That's what I think the discipline comes from.

01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:34.240
Do you not enjoy the actual hot water,

01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.680
like, raining down on you?

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:39.320
I do, I do, if, if, if the alternative is being covered

01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:40.680
in sweat and dirt.

01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:41.520
Okay.

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:43.120
Then I'm like, I wish this was off of me.

01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:44.200
Time to solve that problem.

01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:45.960
With water all over my body.

01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:47.920
I don't feel that way about, like.

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:50.080
Lollie's the same way.

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:51.200
She does not, like.

01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:52.240
That's an obstacle.

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:54.520
She does not, like,

01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:57.440
being in the bathtub, getting a bath.

01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:59.680
She hates it, she hates it, she hates it.

01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:02.760
But once it's done, she's super happy.

01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:04.400
She's running around.

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:06.200
Okay, so. She's smiling.

01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:07.360
She's.

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:10.680
So is that everyone, or is Lollie just me?

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:14.680
Is everyone here going, like, I hate it too.

01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:17.960
I hate it too, but I still do it, little trooper.

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:18.800
No.

01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.320
Every morning I take that bullet.

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:23.280
You don't do shit that requires anything of you.

01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:24.760
You're not a tested person.

01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:25.680
Lollie every day.

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:27.480
But you also have a, you have a fiance,

01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:29.000
and a girlfriend, and a lover of your life,

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.840
and don't, don't you want to be clean

01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:32.280
when you guys are making Smoochie Towns?

01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:35.000
Yeah, and I don't, I don't, I don't,

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.640
I don't, I'm conscious of that.

01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:39.720
Like, I don't, like, yeah, I don't.

01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:43.320
You, no more bubble baths, you had a bubble bath phase

01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:47.280
where you were no more bubble in your baths.

01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:49.080
You don't do that anymore?

01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:50.920
No, not lately.

01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:51.760
Yeah.

01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:55.040
But you're pretty excited about bathing for a while.

01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:56.480
Yeah, that's true, yeah.

01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:58.800
And then you put your butt too close to the, to the jet,

01:47:58.800 --> 01:47:59.640
and you're.

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:00.480
It's true.

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:01.320
Greatest hits?

01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:03.400
And you, you feel, you feel just up like a water balloon.

01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.240
Early accident.

01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:06.080
You've all been there.

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:09.120
You enimized yourself all over the fucking shirt.

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:10.560
I'll never forget the text.

01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:14.120
He goes, Jeff, I, I flew a little too close to the sun.

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:14.960
Yeah.

01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:18.040
It was, it was bad.

01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:21.400
You're the, you're the Icarus of, of masturbating

01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:22.680
to a jacuzzi jet.

01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:24.080
I remember like running over to the toilet,

01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:25.200
and I sat on it, and it was like,

01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:27.200
I just heard like this bucket come out.

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:29.320
And I was like, Holy shit, that's what anenoma is.

01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:30.720
Like, cause then it was done.

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:33.720
And I was like, well, it's not bad.

01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:34.560
That is what anenoma is.

01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:35.400
I guess that's what that really is.

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:36.960
Yeah, no, no, that is what it is.

01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:39.040
But it was also, there was a residual kind of like,

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:42.960
like, like, like violation.

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.360
Yeah. Like, like that's not.

01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:46.600
Oh, so you, you didn't empty yourself in the bathtub.

01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:47.860
You actually made it to the toilet.

01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:49.960
Yeah. Well, that's the thing is that like,

01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:54.720
the little, my sphincter, my sphincter relaxed enough

01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:55.560
to let it in.

01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.720
Like for all of a sudden just I flood,

01:48:57.720 --> 01:48:59.560
like it's like, it filled instantly.

01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:01.400
And then the moment it felt something,

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:03.200
it snapped shut, I assume.

01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:05.040
So it wasn't like, I could sit in the bathtub

01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:07.640
and be like, like, and release.

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:10.360
It was like, I was like, ah, ah, what happened?

01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:11.200
What happened?

01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:13.000
And I, and it puckered up and like kept it.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.320
And then I sat on the toilet where my anus

01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:17.400
must have felt like safe to like,

01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:20.080
it's like, this is how we do things.

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:22.120
And then it just like let out this like,

01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:24.680
unprecedented torrent that I,

01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:25.840
but it sounded healthy.

01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:26.680
But it was like, it was like,

01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:28.440
not a sound to you associate with your butthole.

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:30.400
It was just like a bunch of water coming out.

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.680
And I was like, oh, paint, paint me.

01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:36.360
I'm so French paint for us.

01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:39.520
Paint for us the physical picture of what led up that

01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:41.360
you are on your hands and knees with your butt

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:44.560
against the edge of the, the edge of the tub.

01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:46.960
And there's a jet going into your butt.

01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:47.800
Yeah.

01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:49.000
And you're masturbating because you're getting

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.320
tantalized with the, with the jet.

01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:52.160
Yeah.

01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:53.000
And then you press,

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.600
cause I remember you saying for a few days,

01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:57.600
like I found out that the best thing in the world,

01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.720
I just put my butthole next to the thing

01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:01.560
and it teases your.

01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:02.400
Tickles the room.

01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:05.480
I can see what this bathing thing is all about.

01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:06.720
I finally get it.

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:07.720
That is what, yeah.

01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:10.200
But then you, as you said, I am on record there.

01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:11.880
Like Icarus, you flew so close to the sun

01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:13.560
and your, your feathers melted and you

01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:14.400
fucking put your butt.

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:17.040
It's ironic because I start my, my, my, my Kinsey

01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:20.200
like scale started to like probably drift.

01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:22.080
You know, I was like, Hey, maybe you're a guy

01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:24.000
that likes a little bit of butt play.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.920
Like, like, like who the fuck, like, like,

01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:27.480
like it doesn't put you in a category of people.

01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:29.800
You're just a dude taking a bath and like it allowed me

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:30.920
to be like, yeah, what the fuck?

01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:31.760
We're all different.

01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:32.580
Who cares?

01:50:32.580 --> 01:50:33.420
Like what's the line between?

01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:37.400
And then, and then the irony is that I got comfortable.

01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:40.040
I was like, I don't have any, I don't have enough shame

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:43.920
to keep my little keister tight as a little drum.

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:45.080
I was just like, like, like, like,

01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:47.280
it's probably like a sign of like, you're vulnerable

01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:49.360
and you're like, you know what, this makes me feel good.

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:50.200
Open.

01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:51.040
Wow.

01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:54.720
And then it was like, like, yeah.

01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:56.640
I think I just think that's poetic.

01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:59.560
I know it's not a, there's no moral to that story,

01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:00.880
but I like that geometry.

01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.600
There's certainly a moral to that story.

01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:04.640
Well, because my therapist had said to me recently,

01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:06.320
I thought this was a really powerful lesson.

01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:08.760
I think I might probably mention this in the podcast,

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:11.220
but when I was going through this like writer's block thing

01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:12.680
and I was like procrastinating and stuff

01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:16.240
and she said something really important to me

01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:19.280
because there was just a series of weeks that went by

01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:21.000
where I was like, you know that thing I said

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.280
I had an epiphany about last week, about writing

01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:25.760
and how I just need to do this and that, uh-huh.

01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:27.960
Yeah, and then I was absolutely positive of that

01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:30.160
when I walked out and then I went and did the same shit.

01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:31.640
Again, yeah, I did, yeah.

01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:35.000
But it was like, she made sure, like,

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.740
because she made sure that that was the place

01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:40.200
where I could always say that,

01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:41.920
so I would never stop saying it.

01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:44.840
So it was like, first of all, she had to make sure

01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:47.520
that my brain understood that this is the place

01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:51.960
where you come and say, whether it's five times in a row

01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:53.960
or a thousand times in a row,

01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:56.280
I walked out of here thinking I know how to write

01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:57.840
and I went home and I didn't write

01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:00.600
and I did the same fucking shit and I self-distracted

01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:02.920
and I ended up not writing anything and I'm back again

01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:04.280
and it's the same story as last time,

01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:06.280
even though then we had a 45 minute conversation

01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:08.480
about how it's all gonna change and then I did it again.

01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:11.480
And that she created this avenue

01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:14.480
where I could walk to my fucking little heart's content

01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:18.080
in that direction and like the fourth time

01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:20.080
I was in her office going, like, I did it again

01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:23.360
or it is again or it is again and this time I said,

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:25.240
but you know what, it's making me think that,

01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:27.080
you know what I think I'm doing wrong

01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:29.080
is that I need to do it this way instead of that way.

01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:31.920
And she said, you know what I think you're doing wrong

01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:35.020
is that you think that you know how to do it right

01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:40.020
and that makes you not sit and accept

01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:45.020
doing it wrong and like the pressure you put on yourself

01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:48.740
to be the guy that knows how to do it

01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:53.740
is gonna keep you in an eternity of trying to get it right

01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:55.820
and you're gonna be continually confused

01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:58.740
that you got it wrong again and here's what I hear

01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:01.420
when you say to me, you did it wrong again

01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:04.940
in spite of all odds, I hear that we're on to something

01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:09.160
because we decided last two weeks ago that like,

01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:10.820
oh, it's all about this or that.

01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:15.220
I think whatever makes you fuck up is scared.

01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:18.780
It's like, you don't walk away from die hard

01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:20.540
because the time lock engages.

01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:23.020
Like, you know you're almost there.

01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:25.540
You need to drill further.

01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:28.020
It's like, that's another way of saying,

01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:30.260
forgive yourself for fucking up

01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:32.660
as you have like cited the thing you wanna change

01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:37.660
about yourself, not changing overnight means you're at the

01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:40.580
you're at the site of the construction.

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:45.100
Like you're at the spot where a wall needs to be a door.

01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:46.380
Fucking idiots.

01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:53.320
But then she was like, why do you have dirty dick disease?

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.620
Why don't you take a shower, you fucking faggot.

01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:56.460
Clip hanger.

01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:04.860
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:07.940
You're Comptroller, Rob Trob.

01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:08.780
Yeah.

01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:13.980
No, you keep going.

01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:15.380
I don't know what to do.

01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:21.660
Goodbye to you and goodbye to Steve Levy

01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:27.220
and goodbye to Spencer and goodbye to Dan.

01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:34.540
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye from Harmontown.

01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:38.060
Harmontown is brought to you by Harmontown.

01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:41.940
What are you looking for, Harmon?

01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:43.140
Go to Harmontown.

01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:49.180
I can't smoke before the show.

01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:52.260
It's gonna be a good Comic-Con.

01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:54.380
Rob Trob, everybody, we'll see you all very fast.

01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:57.380
Take chances.

01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:18.860
Did you get any of that?

01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:25.860
It's a good show.
