WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Oh, yeah. I'm in that kind of mood, you guys. A hardcore mood.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
It's time for the five most magical of words. Harmontown is now in session.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
Everybody, Dan Harmon.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
Thank you very much. What a warm welcome.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
All right. We've got some guests. We've got some guests tonight.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
I was at the Creative Arts Emmys tonight.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
Did a little presentation with Joel McHale.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
I don't think there's anything to talk about there. It was fun at the Nokia Theater.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
I own a tux now. I finally bought a tux, so I don't keep renting them.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Is that televised or non-televised?

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
It'll be televised on the FXX network. FX has now created an FXX network.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
So it's non-televised.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
I mean, you know, from what I've heard, actually, you'd think it was just sort of like,

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
let's just start another thing like MTV2 or whatever, but it sounds like LandGraph,

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
who's the genius, one of the few suits that I really respect and love,

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
and LandGraph over at FXX.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
It sounds like he's moving all the comedy over to FXX.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
That's what I've heard, because he wants FX to be associated with their dramas.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
I mean, they're fucking, they're murdering it over there.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
That guy is like really, and Nick Grad and the people that work at FXX,

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
they're a true scientific demonstration of the fact that it's not just bullshit when you say,

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
hey, just be creatively respectful to the creatives and stay out of their way,

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
like make deals with the people you want to work with.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
They pay lip service to that philosophy and they execute it.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
They only help.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
They say, look, we're not giving you a ton of money.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
You can do whatever you want here.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
And look at all the programming on FX. It's fucking amazing.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
They went all kinds of awards. I don't know, whatever.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
I can't suck their little wieners enough.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Now I call them little wieners.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I wanted to colloquialize it a little more.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
I accidentally said they had little wieners.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
That'll be, now that'll be the quote in the headline.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
Dan Harmon bashes jabs, flip flops.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Dan Harmon took a shot at.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Dan Harmon jab dibs.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Dan Harmon bashes.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
Dan Harmon peen, pan, boom, bow.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
It's like I'm a professional wrestler.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Like I just say things.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Just go, can I have an omelet?

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
Dan Harmon jabs omelets.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah, well, I need to eat it.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I had to eat it. I had to put a fork in it.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Dan Harmon sticks it, sticks it to his omelet.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Click here for the details.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Oh, could I have a little, a little penny for my Bacardi ad?

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Will you click in it?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
I don't even know what songs you're here reading about

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
how Dan Harmon jabs and jabs.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
What is the difference between a jib and a jab?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I'm not sure.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
It doesn't matter, man.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Did you wear your eye Harmon with your tuxedo?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
No.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
Now, Dan, that's an opportunity to fucking market the eye Harmon.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
It would have been badass of me or whatever the opposite of badass is

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
to wear the eye Harmon to the Emmys on a stage.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
But I felt like it would be distracting.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I had a bit to do.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
I'm just not like I'm going to be meeting it up there.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I had to, I know I set up here.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
You can't pick and choose.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
You got to wear the eye Harmon.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
You got to make it work.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Did you miss it while it was away?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah, for a couple of times I was like,

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
I don't know what's going on with this, but there was a teleprompter.

03:50.000 --> 03:59.000
Anyways, congratulations to everyone that won a creative arts Emmy.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
They're still gold.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
The real Emmys are next week.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Jeff, did you know that Feral Audio is a network?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
It's a whole network.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
The what?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Harmontown is just one of many Feral Audio programs.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
What's under the mistake and assumption that we were the only podcast there is?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
No, no.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
I mean, we could be if we wanted to.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
We chose, like Han Solo choosing to be part of the rebellion,

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
we chose to be part of the alliance in hopes of taking down whatever the Death Star is,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I assume lack of listenership.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
What's in it for you and me?

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Han Solo, I believe, was paid for his services.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Well, see, that's the thing.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
See, that's where you're getting wrong.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
Han Solo was, that was him still being regular Han Solo.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Right.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
The celebrated pussy Han Solo from the end of Star Wars is the one who's going,

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
okay, I got my money.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Actually, that's not true, is it?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
No.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
He got his bounty.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
He got his money at the top of Empire.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
These guys don't even know.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
They're like, which one had the squeab squab in it?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
And I don't even know who you're talking about.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Who's squeab squab?

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Which race did he malign?

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Which weirdly racist CG character are you talking about, squeab squab?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
I don't know.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
In my day, there was flesh and blood on camera.

05:17.000 --> 05:25.000
Dan Harmon, jib jab, squeab squab.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
Click here to hear the real audio from the jibbing and jabbing.

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
One of our newest brethren at the Feral Audio Network, I looked at it.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
He's a partner of our friend.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Do you know James Adomian?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Did you know that guy?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
He's from Channel 101 alone.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
He's out in their appropriate.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
He's a very, very, very super talented, funny guy.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
He does incredible impressions.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
You probably haven't seen this, but there's that show.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
Marc Marons took WTF, his sort of Ilan from that.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
And he's doing this IFC show, Marin.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
And then they did this thing on the web called Marin in Space,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
where James Adomian is playing Marc Maron.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
And it's really fucking funny.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
It's an impression of Marc Maron.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
It's really, really fun to watch.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
It's just Marc Maron flying around in space.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
Anyways, his partner who produced that with him probably wrote it.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
I don't know, we'll ask him for the details.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
But he has a podcast on the Feral Audio Network.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
It's called Don't Ever Change.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
And we're going to bring him up right now and talk about it.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
His name is John Roy.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Hello, John.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
Grab any mic you want.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
Sorry, my intros take a while, but my interviews are even worse.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Awesome.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
I'm in.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I'm a bad interviewer.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
But I'm interested about your podcast because the cult don't ever change.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
And I haven't listened to it yet, but specifically you have guests on

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
and you talk about the person that they were in high school.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
That's it.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Just all about high school.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
So we've had, we've had Jonah Ray on.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
We had Matt Myra, Sean Patton.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
We've got Howard Cramer coming up.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
We just did Ron Funches.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
There's a lot of comedians just talking about what they were like in high school,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
what their town was like, what kind of the feel of that.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
And then any weird stories like Jonah Ray got in a fight with a Samoan guy.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
The Samoan guy ended up falling down the stairs without Jonah doing anything.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
And then they expelled Jonah from high school.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Like it's like weird stories like that because the dude was on the football team.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
So Jonah had to leave the school because he fell down the stairs essentially.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
So it's like weird stories like that.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
And it would have upset the balance for him to stay because it would have,

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Jonah Ray would have, would be the guy that beat up a Samoan guy.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
People would be gunning for it, man.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Like he'd have to defend it.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I don't even know.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
I think you go straight to the top of you, knock a Samoan down the stairs.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
I don't want to.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
That's, yeah.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Then you just, Mr. Saman, then Tyson and you're done.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
I think like I did pretty.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
In terms of high school politics, I think you're finished.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
You're Walter White season five.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I took the Samoan out.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Tread lightly.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
At my high school, at my high school, there was a girl and she was this,

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
she was big and she was in the Crips and she beat up three guys from another gang.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
She was Samoan.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Every detail that story gets better and better.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Like a ladder.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
She was as big as a house and she was very sweet.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
She got, there was a fight broke out and she beat up three guys.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
One on three, full, all three.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
And I won't say her name, but she, in front of an AMPM gas station,

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
she just boxed down three other dudes and like handily.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Well, there's not going to be four women who all did that.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Which one of us is he talking about?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Like he won't say the name.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
So I guess.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Well, I mean, yeah.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
People that went to my high school.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
They know who she is.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
They know who she is.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
And I wish her well.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
If you're listening and you're Samoan and you've,

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
and you're not a badass, like feel free to write into the show and go like,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
this is offensive stereotype.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
I mean, as sooner or later, we'll get around to that, right?

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Like we're, we're making good headway into our Roddenberry vision of tomorrow.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Where pretty soon it'll be not okay to say Samoans or badasses,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
but as of press time,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
I'm sad to say I don't meet enough Samoans in my life anymore.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I think that's part of it.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
It's an obscure group.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
But whenever you hear the word Samoan,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
it's in reference to somebody beating the shit.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Like that's not beating the shit out of it.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Like it's usually in profession.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Like there's a Samoan boxer, a Samoan wrestler,

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
a Samoan or a Samoan kid from your high school that was like a quarterback or something.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Like they, they, they, they color between the lines,

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
but they're, they're, they're, they're unstoppable.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
They're juggernaut people.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Again, if that's,

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
it's almost like in a role-playing game when certain races get certain bonuses,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
like you have a plus for two strength if you're a dwarf,

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
like if we were really had that for human groups,

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
maybe Samoans get like extra strength.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Let's, let's, let's clean that up.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
I'm assuming it can't be true.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
I'm sure I'm assuming that's, that's perfectly racist and like,

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
like tweet me or tumble me or whatever you want to say.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
I am a, I am a very, very mild, like, like, like,

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
but, but that's the other thing though is it's like, like, like,

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
they're, they're, I feel like good naturedness is also thrown in there.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Like it's like, happy people who could beat you up and aren't.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
They're going to hang out and have fun.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
That's part of it.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
It's not like, it's not like they eat a lot of them.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Their diet is basically root vegetables.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
But if you're, if you're a, if you're a scrawny, clumsy,

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
mean, like, like, like, like, like, like short tempered,

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
ineffective bully who always gets his ass kicked and you're Samoan,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
we'd love to hear from you.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
So we can get, just end this.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
If you're a Samoan, you've ever been the head in the arms length bully,

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
classic bully thing and you're unable to punch that guy and you flail away

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
in the air, then yeah, that's cool.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
That will help us know that people are just people.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
I can't believe it took us 72 or so Harmontowns to get to Samoans.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
It's not, it's, it's not like I'm operating with a scalpel.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
I'm sort of just keep banging a shovel on the wall.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I wish black people liked me.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
That's the way to do it.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I think that's how you get them to like you.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I'm very forgetful and I tend to repeat myself.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
And I, anyways, so John Roy, how long have you been doing this podcast

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
with people talk about themselves in high school?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
We've taped about, or taped Jesus Christ.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
No tape was ever used ever in any podcast, but I'm 39.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
So I still say tapes for everything.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
We've been doing it about, we've done about 10 episodes, but we've put out about six of them.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
So really recently we just started it.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
We started it all in the new studio.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
So we recorded every one up there in Burbank and it's been great.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
That's my studio.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Oh, well, well, thank you.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
It's pretty good, man.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I just hope people are, people love it.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
They, you can tell when they walk in like, oh, there's no visible moth balls.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
This is good.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
Like a lot of times you report, you record podcasts in like under a Murphy bed.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Like it can be bad.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Like you don't really know.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
So they like it.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
Yeah, I'm trying to become like the Howard Hughes of zero profit industry.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
This is my first move.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
Just skip directly to the urine and jars without the money part in the middle, I think.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
I was urinating in jars when I was 16.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I think that's why I got fixated on Howard Hughes.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
I'm like, you can make money doing this?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
The answer is no.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
No, but I'll figure it out.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Oh, fuck, fuck.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
God damn it.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
But so you've recorded 10 of them, you've done 10 of these interviews.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
Like I'm curious if they're like, are there patterns emerging?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Yeah.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah, absolutely.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
You know, there's kind of a, you know, a lot of the people I would say over now we've,

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
we've probably, most of the people were really fairly unpopular in high school that became comedians.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
But then every now and then you'll get one anomaly.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
Like Jay Larson was like the biggest stud of his entire school.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
And he's also super funny.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
So, but I'd say about for most, for the most part you get a fairly unpopular guy who learned

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
that all that shit didn't matter when he discovered either music or comedy or something.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
And then by about like 25 or so, he's pretty cool.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
And now he's a comedian.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Do you think, which chicken lays which egg there?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Or which egg lays which chicken is it?

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
Are people that are destined to play guitar or paint something well or make people laugh?

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Are they like, are their brain shaped differently?

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Therefore, they're not as facile at school politics.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
Or is it just like, hey, somebody's got to be the dork and it's you.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Therefore, you're going to end up drawing apples better.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Probably not the latter.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
I feel like, like there's certain personality traits and skills you have to have to be funny.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
And you can get the impetus to drive you to get those skills in different ways.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
If you are unpopular, it's like a defense mechanism.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Like I can't beat these guys up, but I can make fun of the teacher.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
They'll all laugh at that.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
Think I have some kind of anti-fear powers.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
And then they're like, oh, maybe he's got something to him.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Or you could be super popular at school, but you got to ship all home life.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
And the only way to make your dad fucking pay attention is you learn how to get this funny thing going.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
So I think there's a lot of ways that will teach a guy who has the aptitude for it

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
that maybe you should try, if he said something right now, maybe everybody will laugh.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
Is the same go for male and female comics?

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
We are just about to have our first female guest coming up.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
We're going to have Emily Gordon on.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
So that'll be the first opportunity to be like, hey, are we learning universal things?

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
Or are we learning just boys' clubs, crybaby in the room with quadrophenian earphones going,

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
why don't you wake me?

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
Is that just a male thing or is that an everybody thing?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
I don't know.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
That's always something I've wondered.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
I felt like this question has been very delicately trod on territory.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
It's like female comics versus male comics and stuff.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
I just felt like, for me, the male class clowns were rewarded for it.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
The female class clowns were punished for it.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
The teachers shut them off.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
The reinforcement was different.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Or the other classmates did.

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
It was not as okay for a gal in my junior high and high school to kind of wisecrack for some reason.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Like, I don't know where it came from.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
If it was everybody or from the top down.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
I'm going to ask that very question and we'll find out the answer to that.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
She'll be able to really bring...

14:50.000 --> 14:57.000
You'll make up for Ten Dude's interviews with her because she's also trained in the whole thinking about all that stuff as well.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Right.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
We want anyone thinking about anything.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
A lot of times our podcast is like, what is you eating Burger King?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Oh, fucking all that shit.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Chicken sandwich?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Oh yeah, chicken sandwich.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
We need to get a little bit more intellectual discourse on things.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
That's kind of like Harvard Town.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
It's a little like Harvard Town.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
Girls are definitely socialized to like...

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Socialize.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Right?

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
Like guys are told, at least maybe this is a generational thing and we're changing it now,

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
but it's always been the thing of like guys are told, don't change your mind about anything.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
That's a form of weakness.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
So you have these weird arguments with guys about like, I thought you said you hated the Matrix.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
What's up, fucker?

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
And it's like guys have emotional reactions to that stuff.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
I go like, no, I said, but I said I didn't like any Keanu Reeves movie.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
He did a good job with the Matrix.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
I'll give him that.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
I'll give him that.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
You can be the biggest nerd in the world, but you're having this like male socialized

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
experience.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
But even though no one's starting any punches and no one could, if it ever came to that.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
And the stakes get me lower.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
That's your opinion of the Matrix.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
You can change it.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
You can change it.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
I used to like the Matrix.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Now I don't.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Good.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Fine.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Are we getting food?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
What the fuck?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
I don't care.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.820
So, I suggest if you believe in your shooting while you're voting on progone asylum attacks,

16:12.820 --> 16:14.280
that's how you cover your life.

16:14.280 --> 16:17.220
It doesn't matter how bad your life is.

16:17.220 --> 16:22.000
You can turn something up where you're gonna be already.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.600
Challenge, religion, love.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.000
And you don't end up with the Matrix.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
It's still time.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
In that case, you gotta run out of time.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Frugal.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Is this the first time you've seen this funny?

16:35.000 --> 16:40.600
right. Well, I think that's why you, I think you make yourself right. Yeah, you pick, you'll go like

16:40.600 --> 16:44.440
ketchup's the worst and I'll tell you why. And then you just, you just plant a flag and then

16:44.440 --> 16:50.360
you're not gonna, you're not gonna stop until mustard is illegal. And it's like, you just, you just do

16:50.360 --> 16:58.760
it to do it. I do it because, I mean, I pick, I think in the past I would pick things like you say

16:58.760 --> 17:03.800
and then I would stick to them for no reason. I did do what you said is that, like sometimes I would

17:03.800 --> 17:09.160
just pick the diametrically opposed thing just to have that sort of interaction. Just get that

17:09.160 --> 17:13.240
thing going, whatever that is. I think I definitely outgrew that, but like I'll just go like, you

17:13.240 --> 17:17.480
know what, like fuck Wolf Blitzer, fuck Led Zeppelin, fuck this, fuck that. Well, the second

17:17.480 --> 17:24.200
one's controversial. Who's gonna go, wait a minute, fuck Wolf Blitzer? Did you just say something

17:24.200 --> 17:31.800
about News Candy Rogers? The camera pans over and there's like a Paul Bunyan guy who's just

17:31.800 --> 17:39.080
wiping his mouth with a napkin. I can tolerate a lot of things. I've watched my country go from

17:39.080 --> 17:45.000
a field of beautiful pine to a bunch of Walmart parking lots, but I won't have anybody selling

17:45.000 --> 17:52.280
a Wolf Blitzer's name. You sir can meet me outside. But like, you know, I, I, I, my joke was always

17:52.280 --> 17:57.640
that I can convince anybody that they don't actually like Rush because they don't, because

17:57.640 --> 18:01.560
you're right. They don't like them. No, you had, you had an older brother who did and you're, you're an

18:01.560 --> 18:07.800
idiot. And don't say they're technically a good man because Hitler was technically a good chancellor

18:07.800 --> 18:12.760
and shit. That's what I think Rush did and what bothers people that hate them. And I know people

18:12.760 --> 18:18.120
like them. They took rock and roll and then they drained all of the sex out, just all of it, just

18:18.120 --> 18:24.680
pulled all every amount of sex. And then they replaced it with Anne Rand and sci-fi, which is not

18:24.680 --> 18:29.480
a good substitute. Rock and roll with sex. It was Elvis, it was Elvis and all that shit. And I was

18:29.480 --> 18:35.480
like, no, we'll take all of the reason this music exists. We'll move that. It's about the fountain

18:35.480 --> 18:42.360
head with bass pedals and octagon trumps. Because Rush, Rush was like 70s, 80s, right? Like, yeah,

18:42.360 --> 18:48.120
yeah, it's a lot of sexy music. A lot of people were inseminated and conceived during-

18:48.120 --> 18:54.760
by touring the snow dogs. Nobody was conceived to a Rush song. Nobody put on red Marchetta and

18:54.760 --> 19:02.200
took his pants off. Nobody's father came drink, ah, salesman. Salesman!

19:07.320 --> 19:09.960
In fact, in fact, my sperm count just got lower with sales.

19:09.960 --> 19:17.480
Look, what, look, though his mind is not for red, to any God or government. It's reserved

19:17.480 --> 19:23.160
a quiet defense, lighting out the day's mess. Fucking Rush can go fucking.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.440
If you choose to not decide, you still have made a choice.

19:26.440 --> 19:30.200
No, no, you haven't. You haven't at all. Honey, not tonight. I have a headache again.

19:32.520 --> 19:38.520
I think I have a technically, I have a technical headache. Joe Hill, the author, totally hates Rush

19:38.520 --> 19:42.840
and he was tweeting some shit and somebody tweeted something about how he was just so mad

19:42.840 --> 19:47.000
that Rush was in the hall. So Joe Hill goes, in honor of Rush getting in the Rockin' Hall of

19:47.000 --> 19:51.320
Fame, I will now listen to all my favorite Rush records. And then a minute later, he goes, done!

19:53.000 --> 19:58.360
I mean, I, yeah, when I played Dungeons & Dragons in high school, my first Dungeon Master,

19:58.360 --> 20:04.360
no, not my first, my best Dungeon Master, Graham, had the jean jackets and he had the,

20:04.360 --> 20:09.480
all his t-shirts were like from different states that had state parks because he loved,

20:09.480 --> 20:14.040
he loved nature. He wanted to be an elf or like Spock. Like he was one of those personalities.

20:14.040 --> 20:20.200
He, he barefoot alighted himself on his, on his pit stains, like, like, and went to high school

20:20.200 --> 20:24.760
with a woman's briefcase and, and because he was like, I give zero fucks. Like, I guess you didn't know,

20:24.760 --> 20:28.200
okay, because, because he was like, he's like Spock, but like badass.

20:28.200 --> 20:33.000
He gave and received zero fucks. Yeah, it's like, fuck you, I'm smarter than you. Like,

20:33.000 --> 20:38.040
you know how you want, you want like the Columbine kid to, you want to reach back in time and go,

20:38.040 --> 20:42.280
it doesn't matter. Like, Graham was one of the kids that, he knew it didn't matter. Okay.

20:42.280 --> 20:45.080
That's the personality you get. He's just like, fuck this, fuck this, fuck all of it.

20:45.080 --> 20:50.360
He saw you losing the minute they presented it to him. But he loved Rush, yeah. He loved

20:50.360 --> 20:55.080
Denim and Rush and, and, and, and, and yeah, they were like, you know, he'd sign your yearbook with

20:55.080 --> 21:01.080
Rush lyrics and, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't hate him. I, he made me, he, he, he, he, because he

21:01.080 --> 21:04.760
loved him so much, I would, I would be like, I would be one of those diametrical guys and go,

21:04.760 --> 21:11.560
like, they're the worst. Pink Floyd's way better. Like, right. Is it yes, is it yes, the band that

21:11.560 --> 21:19.400
has like a, they're all good people. They may absolutely fuck off into the night forever.

21:21.880 --> 21:25.960
I'm sorry. I have a special guest, you know, I hate to, we're talking about music, but you

21:25.960 --> 21:31.080
know, I really, it's Neil Pert right behind me right now. You don't have to deal with the professor.

21:31.080 --> 21:36.600
One of, one of my favorite musicians of the world from the Michael Jackson Thriller song is

21:36.600 --> 21:42.200
Vincent Price. Did you, I don't know if you knew that, like, is he here tonight? Well, he's, yeah,

21:42.200 --> 21:48.440
a lot of people think he's dead, but Vincent Price is actually here. Is it Vincent Price, the actor,

21:48.440 --> 21:54.680
or Vincent Price from, from Thriller? It's, it's Vincent Price, it's Vincent Price, the actor.

21:54.680 --> 21:58.520
I don't know if he wants to do the, the Thriller bridge. Should I get, should I do a beat? Maybe

21:58.520 --> 22:02.280
you could rap a bit and he could do like the, the Vincent Price breakdown in the middle of it?

22:03.640 --> 22:10.600
I mean, we could. It's been so very long. It's James Adomian, everybody.

22:13.160 --> 22:16.920
That's one of my favorite impressions that he does is this Vincent Price. He did it in a,

22:16.920 --> 22:25.640
in a Yacht Rock episode. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. I'm rapping bout, rapping with my friend Vincent

22:25.640 --> 22:31.320
Price. Gonna do the rap, then he's gonna do the bridge. Nice. First I'm gonna talk about my favorite

22:31.320 --> 22:48.280
cereal. Yo, I like to pour it into a bowl and eat it down. Drain the milk, slowly. He just made

22:48.280 --> 22:57.240
cereal spooky. I don't know what else to do there. Mount Chocula brand cereal.

22:57.240 --> 23:03.960
Yeah, just, all right. Well, anyways, I don't know. I don't want to pimp you to do impressions

23:03.960 --> 23:07.560
and stuff, but. Oh, I love that. I love when he, when, I, when I was a kid, he used to do

23:07.560 --> 23:12.760
advertisements, like you would. Cousin subs, for instance? I don't know that one. What is it,

23:12.760 --> 23:16.600
how does it go? Well, I was, I was a local sub place hat. You've had Vincent Price on the, on

23:16.600 --> 23:22.680
the payroll and he would go, hello, sorry to interrupt your meal, but you could be having

23:22.680 --> 23:30.200
a spooky sandwich. I was just about, I was, and he would pull a cord and a cheap ass photo shop

23:30.200 --> 23:36.520
pendulum would cut the sandwich in half. That's how I cut my sandwiches. Ham has been murdered.

23:37.320 --> 23:42.600
Was that voice ever actually considered scary by society? Like, why that voice? It's weird.

23:42.600 --> 23:47.000
It dates back to really asshole landlords from the 1800s. That's why they're afraid

23:47.000 --> 23:51.640
they could cut off their gas oil at any moment. So that voice is terrifying. People really used

23:51.640 --> 23:56.200
to believe in vampires. I think it's, so you didn't have to be like ripped in order to be scary.

23:56.840 --> 24:01.320
We transitioned into a society where like we had enough security camera footage

24:02.120 --> 24:06.600
to realize that the really scary thing is physical fitness and, you know,

24:09.400 --> 24:15.560
sociopathic was no longer sociopathology, not people who are, I'm a gentleman. I like the

24:15.560 --> 24:21.640
smell of your blood. It's like, like that guy you can take down. Aesthetic reasons are the reasons

24:21.640 --> 24:27.800
I persecut you. I was like, there used to be a fear of people like Bella Legosi. Like that guy's

24:27.800 --> 24:32.680
not scary really through a modern lens. Yeah, look at that weak link. He's out to get us.

24:33.720 --> 24:38.200
Not after you see enough like Chinese babies getting run over in parking lots. Like I got

24:38.200 --> 24:43.560
four a chance. Hey, I didn't put them there. Jesus, why do I always bear the brunt for these

24:43.560 --> 24:48.840
videos I mentioned? Wait, tell me more about the Chinese baby parking lot.

24:49.960 --> 24:55.320
Dude, if you know what to look for and I do, no, there's horrible things that happen.

24:55.880 --> 24:59.480
If I type those keywords in, I'm looking at a video of babies being run over in a parking

24:59.480 --> 25:05.560
lot. There are so many cameras now and there's been that way for so long and the population

25:05.560 --> 25:12.200
is so high now and there are so many countries where, like China has different rules, by the way.

25:12.200 --> 25:17.320
I guess I'm rift. Oh, you're saying this surveillance footage of a baby accidentally

25:17.320 --> 25:22.040
being run over. There's not a parking lot full of babies that people as a blood sport like.

25:22.040 --> 25:25.880
Well, that might be a thing. I don't know. One child policy wasn't working.

25:27.320 --> 25:32.120
There's just horrible shit you can see. Like in countries that are overpopulated and that don't

25:32.120 --> 25:36.440
have good Samaritan laws, you know, where there's like, there's just like, oh, this guy was eating

25:36.440 --> 25:47.400
someone on a subway. Look at this. Anyways. Eating on a subway? Where? What would Vincent

25:47.400 --> 25:52.440
Price have to say about a Chinese baby getting run over? Oh, God. Nothing appropriate.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.040
My one son.

26:00.040 --> 26:08.280
My one precious son. Come unto the carbuncle.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.600
Come unto the carbuncle. That was a big post story, I think.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.800
Come unto the carbuncle. Wasn't that egg round? Oh, I think.

26:17.800 --> 26:21.960
All right, let's make it easier. Wait, keep the music on, Jeff. Hey, Vincent Price, maybe we

26:21.960 --> 26:29.320
should go. Vincent Price, I know you're my roommate. I was hoping that we could pay the bill

26:29.320 --> 26:38.360
to the Department of Water and Power. My card isn't work. Could we go to the grocery store together?

26:43.240 --> 26:49.720
I just, we need to get some Sudofan and some maple syrup. Do you mean some pseudo-athedron

26:49.720 --> 26:56.120
for your ills? Oh, my God. I have quite the elixir roommate of all mine. Oh, my God. It's

26:56.120 --> 27:02.840
making me drowsy. I don't know. Okay. I hope that's the first episode of a long series of

27:02.840 --> 27:12.440
Vincent Price's My Roommates. Can you do, can you do, can you do Marin on Q? Or is that?

27:13.480 --> 27:16.040
Let me do an interview with Marc Maron real quick. Yeah, what do you want? Yes.

27:17.960 --> 27:23.240
So I just, come on. What, really? Thanks for having me on your show, Marc Maron.

27:23.240 --> 27:28.200
Oh, yo, yeah. It's my show because I thought I was being interviewed. Yeah, fine. So you did

27:28.200 --> 27:35.640
this show. What was that like? That's awesome. Yeah, you got to say Marin in space is fucking

27:35.640 --> 27:42.520
amazing. Thank you. It's really, really, really funny. They're web shorts. You spend the whole

27:42.520 --> 27:49.400
time laughing. I was talking to you about this. This will sound pretentious to non-LA people who

27:49.400 --> 27:53.080
don't make stuff for a living and all this stuff. It's like we're up here jerking each other off

27:53.080 --> 28:01.240
but let's jerk each other off for a second. Your impressions, I think, because sometimes people

28:01.240 --> 28:04.520
feel about impressions the way they feel about magic. It's like, well, what are you really,

28:04.520 --> 28:08.440
what are you doing? You're just, you're sounding like somebody, but I think there's a, you do them

28:08.440 --> 28:14.520
in a strange, tender way, like you write up to your, when you're doing Marc Maron. Massage the

28:14.520 --> 28:18.280
muscles of the person you're impersonating. Like you're not, you're not sitting there watching

28:18.280 --> 28:23.320
Marc Maron and going, ah, fuck him. Here's how he talks, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh. Like you're,

28:23.320 --> 28:27.080
like you create a character for him. That was rich little process.

28:30.200 --> 28:33.240
I feel sometimes when I'm listening to an impression being done, I feel like, okay,

28:33.240 --> 28:37.320
congratulations. You figured out that, you know, Nick Nolte has an overbite, like, like,

28:37.320 --> 28:42.680
but that's, like, but you, I feel like your, your characters are a little more loving. Yeah, well,

28:42.680 --> 28:48.520
I like, sometimes I hate them. Like George B. Bush, I was trying to ruin him, but yeah, usually

28:48.520 --> 28:53.800
it's like something I'm fascinated by for good reasons. And then it's just fun to sort of imagine

28:53.800 --> 28:57.320
playing being that person. When you're, when you're, when you're in your head, you're like,

28:57.320 --> 29:00.760
you got a little simulator running, like you are the person, right? A little bit because you have

29:00.760 --> 29:05.160
to know what they might say. Yeah. Yeah. That's what helps with somebody like Jesse Ventura,

29:05.160 --> 29:10.120
because he can, he lives in so many worlds is that he, he, no matter what happens, there's either a

29:10.120 --> 29:16.840
conspiracy or an old match that's scarred him. So if I were to, if Jesse Ventura were my roommate

29:16.840 --> 29:24.680
and I needed him to. This is a real crowded apartment. I know, but you, you, you, you, we

29:24.680 --> 29:28.280
toured it together when we decided to sign the lease and I, you haven't paid the, you're part of the

29:28.280 --> 29:33.080
electric bill yet. You mean to the department of water and power? I want to know how high it goes.

29:33.080 --> 29:41.320
It just goes to the office. You just write your, your half is 1750. My half is 1750. And then we

29:41.320 --> 29:49.400
don't, why are there only two parties? It's just two halves of the check, man. It's like, like,

29:49.400 --> 29:55.240
did you go to work this week or? Yep. I was, I was commenting on some underground DVD titles.

29:58.280 --> 30:02.440
You seem defensive when you say that. How much does that pull down a year? I work. I was surfing.

30:02.440 --> 30:09.960
You don't need to know my business. All right, Jesse Ventura. He's an, he's an impressionist.

30:12.600 --> 30:16.600
I don't, I don't get to like a lot of impressionists. It's fun for me. Yeah, no, it is. Yeah, it's,

30:16.600 --> 30:20.200
there's a rarefied number that it's refreshing. You know what? I'm putting out the magician

30:20.200 --> 30:24.040
challenge. If you're a magician and you think that Jeff and I can like you come, come to harm it down.

30:25.560 --> 30:30.600
Do a little magic. Yeah. It'll be great for the listening. For me, like, when you think of

30:30.600 --> 30:33.560
impressionists, like, I have friends that, I have a couple of friends that can do impressions of

30:33.560 --> 30:37.160
almost anybody and it's great. But the reason why it's fun is because they're funny. The things

30:37.160 --> 30:41.560
they say are actually like, you're, you're being funny while saying them. Rich little for my money

30:41.560 --> 30:51.720
isn't a very funny guy. Ooh. He's taken on Wolf Blitzer and Rich little Jeff Davis bashes Rich

30:51.720 --> 31:03.160
little. Take that. Who's next? Frank Gorshin. Remember him? Like, he was actually funny. Like,

31:03.160 --> 31:07.240
when he did Bert Lancaster, it was a fucking riot because he said funny things. Like, so that's,

31:07.240 --> 31:10.840
that's the difference. Like, I wish I could, I can't do an, I can do like two impressions

31:10.840 --> 31:14.840
and no shitty. Like, what would piss me off is I would go on the road as a comic with these guys

31:14.840 --> 31:18.840
who would do impressions of people who are already funny. They were comedians like Rodney

31:18.840 --> 31:24.680
Dangerfield and then they would just do Rodney bits under the guys. I do that. I do that sometimes.

31:26.280 --> 31:31.080
No, I make up a new one. No, you make up a new one. These guys were doing actual Rodney bits.

31:31.080 --> 31:38.440
James, how much respect do you think that you get? You know, I get a little bit of respect.

31:39.960 --> 31:44.040
That's the worst Rodney Dangerfield I've ever heard in my life. You said James.

31:44.040 --> 31:48.440
Do you have to do it like Lipton? Is Rodney there?

31:50.440 --> 31:52.600
I'm always waiting for the James Lipton moment.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.880
Is Rodney inside you right now?

31:57.880 --> 32:03.640
I get, I can do, I can do some impressions. You can do a Liam? You thought you had Liam

32:03.640 --> 32:07.720
Neeson that we found out that you lost it? I thought I had him for a while. Can we try some Liam?

32:07.720 --> 32:12.520
Well, ask me a question about wolves.

32:16.840 --> 32:22.520
The wolves, are they nearby? It doesn't matter if they're nearby. They'll bite you.

32:25.560 --> 32:27.640
Did Liam Neeson? You know what? I walked into that.

32:28.600 --> 32:32.200
It's intimidating looking at him and doing it. Was Liam Neeson eating a sandwich during that one?

32:32.200 --> 32:37.240
There is no sandwich. There's just wolf bites.

32:39.240 --> 32:44.520
Yeah, I'm sorry. I pimped you for that. Who can you most confidently do? Who's your best impression?

32:44.520 --> 32:49.240
No, I don't think I have someone that I'm like, oh, slam dunk.

32:49.240 --> 32:52.840
You don't? You used to do a pretty good Rosie Perez.

32:54.680 --> 32:59.480
Maybe Mr. T. I think I could pity the fool and put something on my head,

32:59.480 --> 33:05.240
but that's more of a prop work kind of thing. Can we want to do a Jesse Ventura?

33:08.280 --> 33:11.400
Just turn your voice over like you've been shouting all day.

33:16.280 --> 33:22.120
You listen to me, rowdy rowdy piper. That's pretty good. It's like a different wrestler.

33:22.120 --> 33:29.240
Now, dad, do the gray, but instead of Liam Neeson put Jesse Ventura in there as the star of the gray.

33:29.240 --> 33:35.480
It doesn't matter how far along we are if they have copes we're already dead.

33:36.760 --> 33:42.760
I sound like Nick Nolte. Rich. This is Gary Busey.

33:46.120 --> 33:47.400
This is also Gary Busey.

33:47.400 --> 33:52.360
This is either Popeye or Marlon Brando.

33:54.200 --> 33:54.920
Or neither.

33:58.600 --> 33:59.800
Don't take that off the table.

34:01.400 --> 34:02.760
Could be neither. Could be neither.

34:02.760 --> 34:05.160
Don't remove that option. We're going to use it.

34:05.160 --> 34:05.960
Or Johnny Carson.

34:09.240 --> 34:12.280
Do Johnny Carson doing a scene from Streetcar named Desire?

34:12.280 --> 34:19.400
Oh, have you heard about the Napoleonic Clause? Johnny Carson was a nerd back in the old days.

34:19.400 --> 34:23.640
We would play a game you'd get high and then you would do what we called plausible Carson episode.

34:23.640 --> 34:27.000
And what it was was you had to introduce three people for a Carson, but it had to

34:27.000 --> 34:31.640
been people who would conceivably be on the same show during the actual run of the Tonight Show.

34:31.640 --> 34:35.400
So you'd be like, we have a great show tonight. We have Martin Moll from the hit movie Mr. Mom

34:35.400 --> 34:40.680
is here. Beautiful young singer Deon Warwick is here tonight. And from Lenny and Squeaky,

34:40.680 --> 34:43.960
Michael McKean, like it would have to be people that actually could have shared a

34:43.960 --> 34:47.320
Carson bill and it gets it. And the game is over when the third name is said.

34:47.320 --> 34:50.200
Yeah. When you just can't, when no one can make, can do it anymore.

34:50.200 --> 34:52.840
Like, and when you're not high enough to still think it's funny.

34:52.840 --> 34:56.600
I think those are like, those are, that's like when the game runs out.

34:56.600 --> 34:57.960
I would play that by mail with you.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.760
Does anyone play Peaks by Mail anymore?

35:04.760 --> 35:05.240
I do. I do.

35:05.240 --> 35:06.600
You don't really play by mail, do you?

35:06.600 --> 35:10.040
I play a game by mail with Matt Gurley from Super Ego.

35:10.040 --> 35:13.560
Super Ego is my favorite podcast. My friend Matt, who I've been, best friends with from

35:13.560 --> 35:18.600
like seventh grade on, we play a game called Death that we started doing in a...

35:18.600 --> 35:19.800
I think we're all playing that one.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.400
Especially the people that are mailing things to each other.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.160
They're the ones that are winning.

35:25.880 --> 35:28.520
I have a real kicker of a chess move.

35:30.280 --> 35:32.680
Make this stamp go down to the post office.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.280
Brook Four and the envelope. So excited.

35:36.280 --> 35:37.880
Two months later, let's see if it worked.

35:37.880 --> 35:42.200
We started in school. One of us would just draw like a guy.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.400
Like a middle of a piece of paper.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.480
We'd just draw a neutral guy standing there.

35:45.480 --> 35:47.640
And then you would draw him dying somehow.

35:47.640 --> 35:51.880
And then you would give it to the person who would slip it, like a note in class.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.520
And originally it was just like back and forth in school.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.840
And by the end of this page, and we have these from school,

35:56.840 --> 35:59.800
where there's just 30 million, like really, they get more and more obscure.

35:59.800 --> 36:00.840
You can't repeat it.

36:00.840 --> 36:01.960
So then they would get really weird.

36:01.960 --> 36:06.040
So now if Matt mails me one, there'll be a guy and there'll just be a fruit cart

36:06.040 --> 36:10.200
way in the background. That has a sign that says oranges,

36:10.200 --> 36:11.480
which is a Godfather reference.

36:12.200 --> 36:14.920
Because every time you see an orange in the Godfather, somebody dies.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.360
Oh, so the fruit cart doesn't have to kill him?

36:16.360 --> 36:20.760
Yeah, it's just, he's going to get whacked because there's oranges in the background.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.480
Right. It's not a fruit cart accident, per se.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.600
But when's the last time you did that?

36:24.600 --> 36:26.040
You're not doing that actively.

36:26.040 --> 36:26.680
It is active.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.760
Whose move is it right now?

36:28.760 --> 36:30.680
It's Matt's. It's on his refrigerator.

36:30.680 --> 36:32.840
And he's fucking taken a long sweet time about it.

36:32.840 --> 36:33.720
What a fucker.

36:33.720 --> 36:34.680
I know. Fuck that guy.

36:34.680 --> 36:38.920
All right. Well, John, Roy and James Adomian anything.

36:38.920 --> 36:41.560
You should listen to Don't Ever Change.

36:41.560 --> 36:43.400
And James, do you have anything going on?

36:43.400 --> 36:43.880
We can-

36:43.880 --> 36:46.920
Nope. Nope. I'm just sort of winding down my whole career.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.840
More podcasts. Just hear me on more podcasts.

36:52.840 --> 36:54.840
Oh, and Marinette Space is on IFC.com.

36:54.840 --> 36:55.320
Yes.

36:55.320 --> 36:56.360
Yeah. Yeah. Go check it out.

36:56.360 --> 36:57.800
It really is funny. I can't recommend it.

36:57.800 --> 36:58.280
All right.

36:58.280 --> 37:08.600
James and John, thanks for coming by.

37:09.880 --> 37:13.240
All right. Look, we've wasted too much time, Jeff.

37:13.240 --> 37:15.960
We got an old friend back that people are very excited is back.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.200
I'm sure they must be excited is back.

37:21.160 --> 37:25.080
I'm sure people love hearing from me about what's going on in my life.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.880
But I really, I swear to God, I got nothing because I'm so excited

37:27.880 --> 37:29.160
of the Kumail Nanjiani's back.

37:29.160 --> 37:29.720
Let's bring him up.

37:44.040 --> 37:47.160
Oh, man. That sounds like what my heart's doing right now.

37:47.160 --> 37:48.360
No, me too.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.960
I think that's why I picked that song today,

37:49.960 --> 37:53.000
because I feel like Sunshine and Lollipops and Moonbeam.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.320
I miss doing this show so much.

37:55.320 --> 37:59.160
We never really, we never officially said you were part of the family.

37:59.160 --> 38:01.080
It was, that's probably why you're part of it,

38:01.080 --> 38:02.360
because you're a very low maintenance guy.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.440
You just came, you know, and it was fun.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.120
So you came back and we just, you know,

38:06.120 --> 38:08.120
that's how I like to do my business, by the way.

38:08.120 --> 38:08.920
I just like...

38:08.920 --> 38:12.680
There was a giant power vacuum that took place to fill up your role in D&D.

38:12.680 --> 38:13.400
What happened?

38:13.400 --> 38:14.040
I'm kidding.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.040
We had Tyler, who did a fucking awesome job, everybody.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.160
Tyler.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.040
Hello, Tyler.

38:19.720 --> 38:21.640
Yeah. I was working.

38:21.640 --> 38:21.960
I was...

38:21.960 --> 38:23.960
What is this?

38:23.960 --> 38:25.960
The show is leaking.

38:25.960 --> 38:27.960
This is the hissing in the background.

38:27.960 --> 38:31.960
There's like a person deflating slowly.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.960
Aww.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.960
Spencer was a balloon the entire time.

38:37.960 --> 38:39.960
That's even more impressive.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.960
You didn't think a human was that unflappable.

38:41.960 --> 38:43.960
Yeah, exactly.

38:43.960 --> 38:45.960
He took everything in stride because he was filled with helium.

38:47.960 --> 38:49.960
Yeah, I was, and then I was in Europe for a couple weeks.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.960
Was that just for fun?

38:51.960 --> 38:53.960
It was just for fun.

38:53.960 --> 38:57.960
Your Instagram photos of Paris and Rome and Florence were outstanding.

38:57.960 --> 39:01.960
My wife and I hadn't taken a vacation in years,

39:01.960 --> 39:03.960
and it was sort of getting to me.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.960
My temper was getting short,

39:05.960 --> 39:07.960
and I just really, really needed to go.

39:07.960 --> 39:09.960
I'd never been there.

39:09.960 --> 39:11.960
And it was amazing.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.960
You give me a lot of great tips.

39:13.960 --> 39:15.960
Camille emailed me and said,

39:15.960 --> 39:17.960
hey, I'm going to be in Paris tomorrow.

39:17.960 --> 39:19.960
You seem well-traveled.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.960
Can you give me some tips?

39:21.960 --> 39:23.960
I don't have any Paris tips,

39:23.960 --> 39:25.960
but I will forward this to Greg Proup.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.960
Greg Proup sent you an email really long,

39:27.960 --> 39:29.960
and it should be published.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.960
It's a poll.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.960
It really should go online.

39:33.960 --> 39:35.960
Maybe I'll put it on the forum with Greg's approval.

39:35.960 --> 39:37.960
It makes you want to pick up everything you can right now

39:37.960 --> 39:39.960
if you could, and just go to Paris

39:39.960 --> 39:41.960
and check off everything off.

39:41.960 --> 39:43.960
Go to Notre Dame at night

39:43.960 --> 39:45.960
and have a cup of coffee at this place.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.960
And then, some night,

39:47.960 --> 39:49.960
just stay in, get bread and fruit,

39:49.960 --> 39:51.960
and watch French TV. It's awesome.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.960
There we go.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.960
It was a poem, and it was all lowercase,

39:55.960 --> 39:57.960
no punctuation, just like beauty, beauty, beauty.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.960
It was wonderful.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.960
It's a great well-rounded history.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.960
There's secret stuff.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.960
Check this out, because you have to see this.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.960
It made me want to go do it.

40:07.960 --> 40:09.960
You asked me, what about Florence?

40:09.960 --> 40:11.960
There's a sandwich place I like.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.960
Hey, it was a great sandwich place.

40:13.960 --> 40:15.960
I almost cried from the sandwich.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.960
This is a weird story.

40:17.960 --> 40:19.960
So we were in Paris, and so we'd missed Breaking Bad,

40:19.960 --> 40:21.960
and it was Monday morning.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.960
We were bummed out because we were out of the country.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.960
This is true. So we're at the Louvre,

40:25.960 --> 40:27.960
the fucking Louvre, where the Mona Lisa is.

40:27.960 --> 40:29.960
And we're sort of talking about Breaking Bad.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.960
We've been there four hours. We're sitting,

40:31.960 --> 40:33.960
and I look over and I'm like, Emily,

40:33.960 --> 40:35.960
is that Vince Gilligan?

40:35.960 --> 40:37.960
The creator of Breaking Bad?

40:37.960 --> 40:39.960
So Emily's like, no.

40:39.960 --> 40:41.960
I'm like, Google what he looks like.

40:41.960 --> 40:43.960
He's Googling it. I go over.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.960
I'm so sure. I'm like, hey, are you American?

40:45.960 --> 40:47.960
He's like, yes.

40:49.960 --> 40:51.960
I was like, are you Vince Gilligan?

40:51.960 --> 40:53.960
And he's like, fuck!

40:56.960 --> 40:58.960
Let me guess, you love Breaking Bad?

40:58.960 --> 41:01.960
Oh, God, what a shocker.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.960
I came to the Louvre,

41:03.960 --> 41:05.960
so I could be second best at something.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.960
Exactly.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.960
I had to escape my genius.

41:11.960 --> 41:13.960
I wanted to get away from the Mona Lisa of TV shows

41:13.960 --> 41:15.960
to see the Mona Lisa of painting.

41:15.960 --> 41:17.960
The Mona Lisa stops

41:17.960 --> 41:19.960
like looking straight out,

41:19.960 --> 41:21.960
looks at him, goes like, I love this.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.960
Oh, God. Big X-Files back, too.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.960
You look over and you see Mona Lisa has her iPhone out,

41:25.960 --> 41:27.960
and you're like, picture her.

41:29.960 --> 41:31.960
I never do this, but I got a picture with him,

41:31.960 --> 41:33.960
because I had my hands were shaking

41:33.960 --> 41:35.960
while I was talking to him.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.960
It was awesome. He was like a great guy.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.960
Nothing, I would have pictured him.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.960
I got to meet him at a function.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.960
I was invited to this TV guide

41:43.960 --> 41:45.960
showrunners dinner or something.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.960
It was the only place

41:47.960 --> 41:49.960
where I'd ever get to meet him,

41:49.960 --> 41:51.960
because he was technically the other.

41:51.960 --> 41:53.960
I just fanned out and took a picture with him.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.960
I don't have a story like that.

41:55.960 --> 41:57.960
But let's talk about his personality

41:57.960 --> 41:59.960
now that we've both met him.

41:59.960 --> 42:01.960
He seems like, he's such a laid-back, nice guy

42:01.960 --> 42:03.960
who, if you give him a compliment,

42:03.960 --> 42:05.960
he always deflects it.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.960
He wasn't me, that was this person,

42:07.960 --> 42:09.960
that was this person.

42:09.960 --> 42:11.960
He gives his whole team the credit

42:11.960 --> 42:13.960
for everything, and that show is...

42:13.960 --> 42:15.960
You know what's interesting?

42:15.960 --> 42:17.960
He's an old pro.

42:17.960 --> 42:19.960
He came up through the trenches

42:19.960 --> 42:21.960
and was like...

42:21.960 --> 42:23.960
He was a big X-Files guy.

42:23.960 --> 42:25.960
Knocking it out of the park on the X-Files

42:25.960 --> 42:27.960
and patiently waited for his turn at bat

42:27.960 --> 42:29.960
and is pioneering the golden age of TV.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.960
I still always anticipate

42:31.960 --> 42:33.960
when you really admire somebody,

42:33.960 --> 42:35.960
I always still picture

42:35.960 --> 42:37.960
a giant, fat mountain

42:37.960 --> 42:39.960
of a person with a huge beard

42:39.960 --> 42:41.960
with squirrels in it.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.960
It always blows my mind

42:43.960 --> 42:45.960
when these people are like clean cut

42:45.960 --> 42:47.960
and articulate and kind of...

42:47.960 --> 42:49.960
Very polite and well spoken.

42:49.960 --> 42:51.960
He was great.

42:51.960 --> 42:53.960
Did someone say a big beard

42:53.960 --> 42:55.960
with squirrels?

42:55.960 --> 42:57.960
Whoa! B.J.

42:57.960 --> 43:01.960
Okay, I feel like I've missed something.

43:01.960 --> 43:03.960
Camille, you haven't.

43:03.960 --> 43:05.960
This is what happened

43:05.960 --> 43:07.960
in the three weeks I was gone.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.960
For the home listener,

43:09.960 --> 43:11.960
B.J. walked up to almost no

43:11.960 --> 43:13.960
fanfare.

43:13.960 --> 43:15.960
What I also love is that he's got

43:15.960 --> 43:17.960
a full thing of frozen yogurt

43:17.960 --> 43:19.960
that's still frozen, so he just got here.

43:19.960 --> 43:21.960
He's dressed somewhere between Jesus

43:21.960 --> 43:23.960
and Mrs. Roper from

43:23.960 --> 43:25.960
Three's Company.

43:25.960 --> 43:27.960
He's holding some ice cream

43:27.960 --> 43:29.960
from Baskin Robbins.

43:29.960 --> 43:31.960
He just walked in, so you're late

43:31.960 --> 43:33.960
to the show, but have the gall

43:33.960 --> 43:35.960
to come right on stage.

43:35.960 --> 43:37.960
He's B.J.

43:37.960 --> 43:39.960
He really doesn't care.

43:39.960 --> 43:41.960
B.J. is a...

43:41.960 --> 43:43.960
I feel like you're just glossing

43:43.960 --> 43:45.960
over the possibility of time travel.

43:45.960 --> 43:47.960
Oh, well, I don't know.

43:47.960 --> 43:49.960
I mean, he...

43:49.960 --> 43:51.960
I don't know if he glossed over it.

43:51.960 --> 43:53.960
To know B.J.

43:53.960 --> 43:55.960
is to have to admit

43:55.960 --> 43:57.960
the possibility of time travel.

43:57.960 --> 43:59.960
But I mean, then his timing would be improved.

43:59.960 --> 44:01.960
I mean, I would like...

44:01.960 --> 44:03.960
If you had the power of time travel,

44:03.960 --> 44:05.960
you wouldn't think...

44:05.960 --> 44:07.960
You know, the awkwardness would be

44:07.960 --> 44:09.960
short off. I saw you at Comic-Con.

44:09.960 --> 44:11.960
I saw you on the sidewalk.

44:11.960 --> 44:13.960
I was gonna say, how are you shorted with him, but...

44:13.960 --> 44:15.960
B.J.,

44:15.960 --> 44:17.960
where does one pick up a smart tunic

44:17.960 --> 44:19.960
like that?

44:19.960 --> 44:21.960
How would you describe what you're wearing right now?

44:21.960 --> 44:23.960
It's apostolic.

44:23.960 --> 44:25.960
It's like...

44:25.960 --> 44:27.960
B.J., come over here.

44:27.960 --> 44:29.960
If you're gonna be up here, grab a mic like a person.

44:29.960 --> 44:31.960
There you go.

44:31.960 --> 44:33.960
Apologize.

44:33.960 --> 44:35.960
He's in bare feet.

44:35.960 --> 44:37.960
Like what?

44:37.960 --> 44:39.960
We had a guy on here

44:39.960 --> 44:41.960
that would give you a run for your money.

44:43.960 --> 44:45.960
Maybe not sartorily.

44:45.960 --> 44:47.960
The look on Camille's face right now

44:47.960 --> 44:49.960
is like, what the fuck?

44:49.960 --> 44:51.960
I go away for two weeks.

44:51.960 --> 44:53.960
Well, I'm thinking of all the decisions I've made

44:53.960 --> 44:55.960
in my life that have led to this exact thing happening.

44:57.960 --> 44:59.960
And I'm happy. I mean, no regrets.

44:59.960 --> 45:01.960
Is anybody getting a good Instagram

45:01.960 --> 45:03.960
to post this on the line for those who will be curious

45:03.960 --> 45:05.960
later on?

45:05.960 --> 45:07.960
B.J., I've been on Instagram.

45:07.960 --> 45:09.960
Can someone tell me how to get an Instagram account

45:09.960 --> 45:11.960
started?

45:11.960 --> 45:13.960
B.J. is a...

45:13.960 --> 45:15.960
Do you have a PhD in theology

45:15.960 --> 45:17.960
or just a master's? I have a PDF.

45:17.960 --> 45:21.960
And...

45:21.960 --> 45:23.960
All right, B.J.

45:23.960 --> 45:25.960
All right, we're okay.

45:25.960 --> 45:27.960
B.J.

45:27.960 --> 45:29.960
I don't know if we talked about this before.

45:29.960 --> 45:31.960
What was it?

45:31.960 --> 45:33.960
The reality show that you won?

45:33.960 --> 45:35.960
What was it?

45:35.960 --> 45:37.960
The great race?

45:37.960 --> 45:39.960
The amazing race?

45:39.960 --> 45:41.960
I'll just say it because he won't give a straight answer.

45:41.960 --> 45:43.960
He won a million dollars.

45:43.960 --> 45:45.960
He won the a million dollar prize.

45:45.960 --> 45:47.960
This is what happens when you win

45:47.960 --> 45:49.960
a reality show.

45:49.960 --> 45:51.960
You won... Okay, you won the amazing race.

45:51.960 --> 45:53.960
You did?

45:53.960 --> 45:55.960
Allegedly. No, he did.

45:55.960 --> 45:57.960
He won an amazing race.

45:57.960 --> 45:59.960
I mean, they had a few of them.

45:59.960 --> 46:01.960
Some were amazing than others.

46:01.960 --> 46:03.960
Did you win a million dollars?

46:03.960 --> 46:05.960
Well...

46:05.960 --> 46:07.960
Just say yes or no.

46:07.960 --> 46:09.960
Did you?

46:09.960 --> 46:11.960
Taxes and the economy and everything.

46:11.960 --> 46:13.960
Mama and everything that's happening

46:13.960 --> 46:15.960
in the news and football and everything.

46:15.960 --> 46:17.960
So, you know, I'm betting and everyone's like...

46:17.960 --> 46:19.960
B.J., do you think that million dollars changed you at all?

46:27.960 --> 46:29.960
And please say yes.

46:29.960 --> 46:31.960
What I want to do is I want to call the showrunners

46:31.960 --> 46:33.960
of amazing race and be like, this is what you did.

46:35.960 --> 46:37.960
I didn't do the show.

46:37.960 --> 46:39.960
You were always this B.J.

46:39.960 --> 46:41.960
You were this B.J. on the amazing race.

46:41.960 --> 46:43.960
I was the last B.J. in the past.

46:43.960 --> 46:45.960
Really?

46:45.960 --> 46:47.960
You were rounding off the edges a little bit

46:47.960 --> 46:49.960
back in the old days?

46:49.960 --> 46:51.960
Aaron knew him in the Clark Kent days.

46:51.960 --> 46:53.960
Oh, yeah.

46:53.960 --> 46:55.960
Before I got my superpowers.

46:55.960 --> 46:57.960
Before you got that hat.

46:57.960 --> 46:59.960
Before I got Lasik.

46:59.960 --> 47:01.960
That hat is his own kind of superpower.

47:01.960 --> 47:03.960
Well, he's actually not the hat I would prefer to be wearing right now.

47:03.960 --> 47:05.960
Really?

47:05.960 --> 47:07.960
That's your second favorite hat?

47:07.960 --> 47:09.960
That's Plan B.

47:13.960 --> 47:15.960
So, are you really, do you really have a Ph.D. in theology?

47:15.960 --> 47:17.960
You didn't answer it.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.960
I'm very good at dodging questions.

47:19.960 --> 47:21.960
Yeah.

47:21.960 --> 47:23.960
Oh, Camel, nice to meet you, man.

47:23.960 --> 47:25.960
Or do you have a Ph.D. in theology?

47:25.960 --> 47:27.960
It is a theology...

47:27.960 --> 47:29.960
Degree?

47:29.960 --> 47:31.960
Of some kind.

47:31.960 --> 47:33.960
I don't have it on me.

47:33.960 --> 47:35.960
I don't have any pockets.

47:35.960 --> 47:37.960
I just...

47:37.960 --> 47:39.960
How did you get that pinkberry?

47:39.960 --> 47:41.960
Did you just say, if you give it to me, I'll leave?

47:51.960 --> 47:53.960
I'm going to get picked apart on Reddit

47:53.960 --> 47:55.960
for that comment.

47:59.960 --> 48:01.960
What flavor of pinkberry did you go with, BJ?

48:01.960 --> 48:03.960
People want to know.

48:03.960 --> 48:05.960
Yeah, when they were like, what flavor do you want?

48:05.960 --> 48:07.960
What do you go?

48:07.960 --> 48:09.960
Oh, the football and economy.

48:11.960 --> 48:13.960
Isn't that vanilla?

48:13.960 --> 48:15.960
Well...

48:17.960 --> 48:19.960
BJ, BJ, if you're going to be that specific

48:19.960 --> 48:21.960
in your closing and your attire,

48:21.960 --> 48:23.960
it's funny how soft-spoken and ambiguous

48:23.960 --> 48:25.960
you are in your replies.

48:25.960 --> 48:27.960
You guys are talking to a million-dollar

48:27.960 --> 48:29.960
theology student here.

48:29.960 --> 48:31.960
I guarantee you, he doesn't have

48:31.960 --> 48:33.960
a lot of that left, right?

48:33.960 --> 48:35.960
That money goes quickly, right?

48:35.960 --> 48:37.960
It's hard to keep it.

48:37.960 --> 48:39.960
I could see your wheels turning

48:39.960 --> 48:41.960
to not answer the question

48:41.960 --> 48:43.960
but say something.

48:43.960 --> 48:45.960
How much of the money do you have?

48:45.960 --> 48:47.960
Are we falling in love?

48:47.960 --> 48:49.960
Is that what they say?

48:49.960 --> 48:51.960
You're like, you're misreading the signals.

48:51.960 --> 48:53.960
You're like, leaning in.

48:53.960 --> 48:55.960
This magic moment...

48:55.960 --> 48:57.960
You're like...

49:01.960 --> 49:03.960
I walk into Pinkberry.

49:03.960 --> 49:05.960
He's got a story. Go ahead.

49:05.960 --> 49:07.960
You guys, if you want to hear the story,

49:07.960 --> 49:09.960
you all have to stop interrupting me.

49:09.960 --> 49:11.960
Here we go.

49:11.960 --> 49:13.960
I walk into Pinkberry.

49:15.960 --> 49:17.960
I think I know what I'm going to get.

49:17.960 --> 49:19.960
I walk up and Chanel

49:21.960 --> 49:23.960
says to me,

49:23.960 --> 49:25.960
take a look to the right.

49:25.960 --> 49:27.960
There's all our choices.

49:27.960 --> 49:29.960
So many more choices

49:29.960 --> 49:31.960
than I thought there would be.

49:33.960 --> 49:35.960
Apparently, I was at the flagship

49:35.960 --> 49:37.960
of Pinkberry.

49:37.960 --> 49:39.960
I'm glad Tim Crouchy isn't alive to see this.

49:41.960 --> 49:43.960
So then,

49:43.960 --> 49:45.960
you got confused

49:45.960 --> 49:47.960
about the choices.

49:47.960 --> 49:49.960
So I said to Chanel,

49:51.960 --> 49:53.960
in my mind, we just cut to a

49:53.960 --> 49:55.960
second unit shot of you two at a convertible

49:55.960 --> 49:57.960
on a country road.

49:57.960 --> 49:59.960
If you guys are going to go find out why...

49:59.960 --> 50:01.960
They accidentally win another million dollars.

50:03.960 --> 50:05.960
It's no accident.

50:05.960 --> 50:07.960
I mean, that's a hat on a hat

50:07.960 --> 50:09.960
playing music while BJ's on stage.

50:09.960 --> 50:11.960
It's a hat on a hat on a hat.

50:11.960 --> 50:13.960
I used to live in a neighborhood with a man

50:13.960 --> 50:17.960
with two hats, and I thought, that guy is crazy.

50:17.960 --> 50:19.960
And that is an indictment.

50:21.960 --> 50:23.960
In the land of BJ's, the man with two hats

50:23.960 --> 50:25.960
is king.

50:25.960 --> 50:27.960
Well, I might as well bring

50:27.960 --> 50:29.960
Erin up. She's usually the BJ

50:29.960 --> 50:31.960
handler.

50:31.960 --> 50:33.960
She's the BJ whisperer, I should say.

50:33.960 --> 50:35.960
She's out here somewhere. She can make me tall.

50:37.960 --> 50:39.960
Here, sweetie.

50:39.960 --> 50:41.960
You can stay, Kumail.

50:41.960 --> 50:43.960
I'll stand here.

50:43.960 --> 50:45.960
Have this...

50:45.960 --> 50:47.960
Can we get another mic?

50:47.960 --> 50:49.960
Here, I'll grab Spencer's. You grab mine.

50:49.960 --> 50:51.960
Have a seat, Erin.

50:51.960 --> 50:53.960
I can stand up.

50:53.960 --> 50:55.960
BJ, you're dripping pink

50:55.960 --> 50:57.960
berry all over our stage.

50:57.960 --> 50:59.960
Oh, my goodness. I have to get a paper towel

50:59.960 --> 51:01.960
or something.

51:01.960 --> 51:03.960
This happens literally every time I

51:03.960 --> 51:05.960
walk into any place.

51:05.960 --> 51:07.960
Erin, talk to BJ.

51:07.960 --> 51:09.960
Hey, BJ.

51:09.960 --> 51:11.960
Hey, Erin. How's it going?

51:11.960 --> 51:13.960
Pretty okay, I guess.

51:13.960 --> 51:15.960
BJ and I used to do an improv show together.

51:15.960 --> 51:17.960
Really?

51:17.960 --> 51:19.960
Can we see a little bit of that

51:19.960 --> 51:21.960
improv?

51:21.960 --> 51:23.960
Can I see a little...

51:23.960 --> 51:25.960
You guys have actually known each other for a while.

51:25.960 --> 51:27.960
BJ's my friend.

51:27.960 --> 51:29.960
I'd like to see a little bit. Try to

51:29.960 --> 51:31.960
approximate the improv

51:31.960 --> 51:33.960
that you guys used to do together.

51:33.960 --> 51:35.960
Oh, hi.

51:35.960 --> 51:37.960
Okay, don't you want a situation?

51:37.960 --> 51:39.960
I guess this is enough of a situation.

51:39.960 --> 51:41.960
Okay, hey.

51:41.960 --> 51:43.960
Hey, are you okay?

51:47.960 --> 51:49.960
Pretty okay, I guess.

51:49.960 --> 51:51.960
Are you okay?

51:51.960 --> 51:53.960
I'm alright.

51:53.960 --> 51:55.960
Scene.

51:57.960 --> 51:59.960
Thank you.

51:59.960 --> 52:01.960
Should we do notes now or after the show?

52:01.960 --> 52:03.960
Erin, what was he like when you guys

52:03.960 --> 52:05.960
were doing...

52:05.960 --> 52:07.960
Was it very similar to the gentleman

52:09.960 --> 52:11.960
before us?

52:11.960 --> 52:13.960
Less dressy, maybe?

52:13.960 --> 52:15.960
I don't know.

52:15.960 --> 52:17.960
Is this dressy?

52:19.960 --> 52:21.960
BJ's...

52:21.960 --> 52:23.960
BJ? I love BJ.

52:25.960 --> 52:27.960
I love Erin.

52:27.960 --> 52:29.960
I love Dan.

52:29.960 --> 52:31.960
BJ's super smart and great.

52:31.960 --> 52:33.960
I love BJ.

52:33.960 --> 52:35.960
I have five dogs one time and I drove BJ home

52:35.960 --> 52:37.960
and we had a big old time and I think your lighter

52:37.960 --> 52:39.960
is still in my car, by the way, if you want it.

52:39.960 --> 52:41.960
Really? Yeah. I would love that.

52:41.960 --> 52:43.960
I thought you might...

52:43.960 --> 52:45.960
BJ's been walking the earth looking for a lighter.

52:47.960 --> 52:49.960
Who else wants to just wander up on stage?

52:49.960 --> 52:51.960
Does anybody...

52:51.960 --> 52:53.960
Let's get...

52:53.960 --> 52:55.960
I think all the people that want to wander on stage...

52:55.960 --> 52:57.960
Adam Goldberg, get up here.

52:57.960 --> 52:59.960
Adam Goldberg.

52:59.960 --> 53:01.960
Oh, he's getting light.

53:01.960 --> 53:03.960
Here, wow.

53:03.960 --> 53:05.960
Tomorrow...

53:05.960 --> 53:07.960
Let's just steer into this spin.

53:09.960 --> 53:11.960
I want to see how many donuts this car can do.

53:11.960 --> 53:13.960
This train only goes forward.

53:15.960 --> 53:17.960
If we ever had brake lines, we don't have them now.

53:17.960 --> 53:19.960
It's when I say a joke,

53:19.960 --> 53:21.960
because that's a pause that...

53:21.960 --> 53:23.960
Adam, tomorrow's your birthday.

53:23.960 --> 53:25.960
Tomorrow is my birthday.

53:25.960 --> 53:27.960
Quarter century club.

53:27.960 --> 53:29.960
I'm excited about that.

53:29.960 --> 53:31.960
Adam, talk to BJ.

53:31.960 --> 53:33.960
I will do my best.

53:33.960 --> 53:35.960
Sup, BJ?

53:35.960 --> 53:37.960
Hi, Adam.

53:37.960 --> 53:39.960
Yes, go right ahead.

53:39.960 --> 53:41.960
It is Vanilla.

53:41.960 --> 53:43.960
I'm not afraid of him. He's just like you.

53:43.960 --> 53:45.960
Maybe just is overselling it a bit.

53:49.960 --> 53:51.960
Adam Goldberg stuck his finger in BJ's pink berry,

53:51.960 --> 53:53.960
and when everyone went,

53:53.960 --> 53:55.960
uh, Adam's response was to say,

53:55.960 --> 53:57.960
I'm not afraid of him.

53:57.960 --> 53:59.960
That's what they were dressing.

53:59.960 --> 54:01.960
Which I think means that he's afraid of him.

54:01.960 --> 54:03.960
That was a total power move, by the way.

54:03.960 --> 54:05.960
Like, I want to put a finger in there.

54:05.960 --> 54:07.960
Well, you got...

54:07.960 --> 54:09.960
He was sunning you.

54:09.960 --> 54:11.960
Not in the sense of the

54:11.960 --> 54:13.960
heliocentric body, the sun.

54:13.960 --> 54:15.960
But he...

54:15.960 --> 54:17.960
We're familiar.

54:17.960 --> 54:19.960
Like Sunday.

54:19.960 --> 54:21.960
It's not here tonight, Dan.

54:21.960 --> 54:23.960
Dan's a dark place.

54:23.960 --> 54:25.960
Just pretend that only Dan can hear me right now.

54:25.960 --> 54:27.960
Like, Dan, if we just keep bringing people up,

54:27.960 --> 54:29.960
you and I can leave.

54:29.960 --> 54:31.960
Tyler, Tyler, go up and share Adam's mic.

54:31.960 --> 54:33.960
Tyler.

54:33.960 --> 54:35.960
Tyler to the stage.

54:35.960 --> 54:37.960
By the way, can I just point out

54:37.960 --> 54:39.960
that we were talking about the Mona Lisa

54:39.960 --> 54:41.960
when this happened.

54:41.960 --> 54:43.960
Oh, yeah.

54:43.960 --> 54:45.960
I don't know how this happened.

54:45.960 --> 54:47.960
Talk to BJ. That's what brought me up there.

54:47.960 --> 54:49.960
BJ's awesome. I'll try.

54:49.960 --> 54:51.960
I wanted to talk about Paris.

54:51.960 --> 54:53.960
I heard people talking about Paris.

54:53.960 --> 54:55.960
Have you been to Paris?

54:55.960 --> 54:57.960
Yeah.

54:57.960 --> 54:59.960
Hey, like...

54:59.960 --> 55:01.960
So you went to Paris?

55:01.960 --> 55:03.960
Going to security for you must be easy.

55:03.960 --> 55:05.960
Take off your shoes, you're like, ha-ha!

55:05.960 --> 55:07.960
One step ahead of you.

55:07.960 --> 55:09.960
Be fungus Bill.

55:09.960 --> 55:11.960
Get up here.

55:11.960 --> 55:13.960
Be fungus Bill to the stage.

55:13.960 --> 55:15.960
I feel like this is like the season finale

55:15.960 --> 55:17.960
of the Muppet Show.

55:17.960 --> 55:19.960
Oh.

55:19.960 --> 55:21.960
Glad it's night in the pips.

55:21.960 --> 55:23.960
Come on out.

55:23.960 --> 55:25.960
I try to leave, but they keep pulling me back in.

55:25.960 --> 55:27.960
Be fungus Bill, how you doing, mate?

55:27.960 --> 55:29.960
Here, here, here. BJ, how are you?

55:29.960 --> 55:31.960
I have this. How did you get this?

55:31.960 --> 55:33.960
It sort of got past me.

55:33.960 --> 55:35.960
That was real powerful. BJ?

55:35.960 --> 55:37.960
Nobody knows what's going on up here right now.

55:37.960 --> 55:39.960
BJ was one of the first people I met when I came to Harmon Down.

55:39.960 --> 55:41.960
BJ and Aaron, both.

55:41.960 --> 55:43.960
Everybody in the front row just come up on stage.

55:43.960 --> 55:45.960
Everybody just come up.

55:45.960 --> 55:47.960
Yeah.

55:47.960 --> 55:49.960
And it's totally wearing the cat shirt.

55:49.960 --> 55:51.960
And it's totally wearing the same shirt that Andrew was

55:51.960 --> 55:53.960
wearing last weekend.

55:53.960 --> 55:55.960
Now everybody, we're going to go shirts and skins.

55:55.960 --> 55:57.960
Jay, Jay.

55:57.960 --> 55:59.960
Hey, what's up, guys?

55:59.960 --> 56:01.960
All right.

56:01.960 --> 56:03.960
All right.

56:03.960 --> 56:05.960
Now what if we blew everyone else in the audience's mind

56:05.960 --> 56:07.960
and we had a perfect dance routine up there?

56:07.960 --> 56:09.960
That would be pretty good.

56:09.960 --> 56:11.960
Wait, and it totally, are you wearing Andrew's cat shirt?

56:11.960 --> 56:13.960
Fantastic, man.

56:13.960 --> 56:15.960
Wow.

56:15.960 --> 56:17.960
All right, so have we hit rock bottom

56:17.960 --> 56:19.960
or we're just about there, Dan?

56:19.960 --> 56:21.960
I don't know why.

56:21.960 --> 56:23.960
I think we should all sing Adelweiss

56:23.960 --> 56:25.960
like from our other guys.

56:25.960 --> 56:27.960
One, two.

56:27.960 --> 56:29.960
Adelweiss.

56:29.960 --> 56:31.960
Okay, get the fuck out of the stage.

56:31.960 --> 56:33.960
Thank you guys for coming out.

56:33.960 --> 56:35.960
All right, let's have a hand for everybody but Kumail, everybody.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.960
Everybody but Kumail.

56:37.960 --> 56:39.960
Thank you.

56:39.960 --> 56:41.960
Thank you for joining us.

56:41.960 --> 56:43.960
Thank you, B. Fungus Bill, Adam, Anatoly, BJ, Tyler.

56:43.960 --> 56:45.960
Who else was up here?

56:45.960 --> 56:47.960
Kurt, Greg, Kurt.

56:47.960 --> 56:49.960
Jay, what's going on, mate?

56:49.960 --> 56:51.960
It's always good when they drop by.

56:51.960 --> 56:53.960
That was pretty awesome. That was fucking great.

56:53.960 --> 56:55.960
Yeah, so not a lot happened while you were gone.

56:55.960 --> 56:57.960
What with BJ?

56:57.960 --> 56:59.960
I've never had more questions for a person

56:59.960 --> 57:01.960
none of which I really want to answer.

57:03.960 --> 57:05.960
I hung out with BJ a few times

57:05.960 --> 57:07.960
and we played some catchphrase back at your place

57:07.960 --> 57:09.960
and stuff and he's a great guy.

57:09.960 --> 57:11.960
I mean, if I just met him, I would say,

57:11.960 --> 57:13.960
that guy seems like he's ripped on ludes.

57:13.960 --> 57:15.960
Costume change!

57:15.960 --> 57:17.960
By the way, BJ's back

57:17.960 --> 57:19.960
completely different outfit.

57:21.960 --> 57:23.960
I thought I heard someone mention

57:23.960 --> 57:25.960
being ripped on ludes.

57:25.960 --> 57:27.960
Have you ever done Kway Ludes, BJ?

57:29.960 --> 57:31.960
Can you get a Kway Lude anymore?

57:31.960 --> 57:33.960
By the way, if we take a picture of you,

57:33.960 --> 57:35.960
this is...

57:35.960 --> 57:37.960
He's very shy, everybody. Please don't take his picture.

57:39.960 --> 57:41.960
I'm trying not to get any more famous.

57:41.960 --> 57:43.960
All right, but now this vacuum

57:43.960 --> 57:45.960
that happens, you come up and then it's like

57:45.960 --> 57:47.960
the excitement and then

57:47.960 --> 57:49.960
air gets sucked out of the room.

57:49.960 --> 57:51.960
Oh, really? I can fix that.

57:51.960 --> 57:53.960
Okay, fix it.

57:53.960 --> 57:55.960
Tell us something. If we ask you a question, answer it.

57:55.960 --> 57:57.960
I can do that.

57:57.960 --> 57:59.960
Do you still have a big chunk of that money?

57:59.960 --> 58:01.960
I've got lots of money.

58:01.960 --> 58:03.960
You do have lots of money. What do you do

58:03.960 --> 58:05.960
every day?

58:05.960 --> 58:07.960
I fancy feasts.

58:07.960 --> 58:09.960
The cat food?

58:11.960 --> 58:13.960
I'm aware that that's also

58:13.960 --> 58:15.960
a brand of cat food.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.960
Nothing gets by BJ.

58:19.960 --> 58:21.960
What time do you wake up in the morning, BJ?

58:21.960 --> 58:23.960
This morning I woke up at 7 a.m.

58:23.960 --> 58:25.960
What? With the sun?

58:25.960 --> 58:27.960
What was first on your agenda this morning, BJ?

58:27.960 --> 58:29.960
I had to move my car. It was parked.

58:29.960 --> 58:31.960
You have a car!

58:31.960 --> 58:33.960
Yeah. It's a Chrysler Lebaron.

58:33.960 --> 58:35.960
It's red. It's a convertible.

58:35.960 --> 58:37.960
I don't know how to put the top up.

58:37.960 --> 58:39.960
Chrysler Lebaron.

58:39.960 --> 58:41.960
Yeah. It's parked outside.

58:41.960 --> 58:43.960
So you have, like, a driver's license

58:43.960 --> 58:45.960
and everything. Yeah, it's inside that frog.

58:45.960 --> 58:47.960
It's back there.

58:47.960 --> 58:49.960
I keep forgetting to bring the frog

58:49.960 --> 58:51.960
every time I come up here.

58:51.960 --> 58:53.960
But it's back there. If someone can grab it

58:53.960 --> 58:55.960
and throw it up here,

58:55.960 --> 58:57.960
we'll take your word for it.

58:57.960 --> 58:59.960
I'll take your word for it.

58:59.960 --> 59:01.960
You have a frog-shaped wallet or satchel, probably.

59:01.960 --> 59:03.960
Exactly.

59:03.960 --> 59:05.960
Magic away from him, Dan.

59:05.960 --> 59:07.960
Yeah.

59:07.960 --> 59:09.960
What do you want?

59:09.960 --> 59:11.960
Do you like people?

59:11.960 --> 59:13.960
People? Yeah.

59:13.960 --> 59:15.960
Like, in general? In general, I like people.

59:15.960 --> 59:17.960
I just don't like when they ask me questions or tell me stories.

59:17.960 --> 59:19.960
No.

59:19.960 --> 59:21.960
So then why did you come up on stage?

59:21.960 --> 59:23.960
Why do you dress the way you dress if you don't like questions?

59:23.960 --> 59:25.960
That's a terrible...

59:25.960 --> 59:27.960
That's a terrible choice to make.

59:27.960 --> 59:29.960
That was a joke.

59:29.960 --> 59:31.960
That's for my friend Frank.

59:31.960 --> 59:33.960
Thank you, Taragula. I have to give him credit.

59:33.960 --> 59:35.960
I didn't come up with that. I actually like people.

59:35.960 --> 59:37.960
I thought that was funny.

59:37.960 --> 59:39.960
Camille, you get three questions to BJ.

59:39.960 --> 59:41.960
Oh, like a troll under a pig.

59:41.960 --> 59:43.960
You get to pick three questions to...

59:43.960 --> 59:45.960
To try...

59:45.960 --> 59:47.960
Yeah, a lot like that.

59:47.960 --> 59:49.960
To try to crack that nut.

59:49.960 --> 59:51.960
To try to get inside the shell.

59:51.960 --> 59:53.960
To learn something about BJ.

59:53.960 --> 59:55.960
All right. What are the three questions?

59:55.960 --> 59:57.960
Three questions and you will answer them?

59:57.960 --> 59:59.960
Yes.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.960
Okay.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.960
When was the last time you cried?

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.960
The last time I cried.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.960
I'll tell you the last time I cried.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.960
No, no, no. You answer first.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.960
Because if I tell mine, then you're not going to answer yours.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.960
You don't have to answer it.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.960
No, I'll be real.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.960
I think the last time I cried

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.960
was

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.960
breaking up with my ex-girlfriend.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.960
Okay. When was that?

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.960
How long ago?

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.960
It was like a few months ago.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.960
Okay, all right.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.960
Do you want me to...

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.960
If you are comfortable...

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.960
Oh, sure, yeah. I mean, this is going to be such a shitty answer.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.960
But I did cry looking at some of the

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.960
paintings in the loo.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.960
I know shit, really?

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.960
Well, I saw this one and it was this gorgeous huge...

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.960
I didn't even look up the name of the painting

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.960
or the guy because I just didn't want to look him up

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.960
and then people are like, oh, he's a hack.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.960
I wanted to have that experience

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.960
but it said that it took him five years to finish it

01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.960
and I just started the moment when it was like five years

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.960
and he was like, the last one, he was like, I'm done.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.960
And it's this beautiful big painting

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.960
in that moment where he's like, this is what I did.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.960
You're crying now? You're getting choked up now?

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.960
For real, right? Well, just a little bit.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.960
I mean, it's just really...

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.960
You know, seeing all these people like...

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.960
doing all this wonderful, beautiful stuff

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.960
it was very affecting. I was very affected

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.960
the entire time I went to all...

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.960
I think that's what's missing from my life

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.960
is any kind of like... I was just like

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.960
yelling at Aaron tonight about

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.960
yelling at some kid on the internet

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.960
about yelling at Sony

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.960
about getting yelled at

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.960
about yelling, about not being appreciated

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.960
about some TV show that I'm making.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.960
Well, but that's how I am too.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.960
I needed to go and look at a painting.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.960
I probably burst into tears myself.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.960
I probably ripped my own head off.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.960
Yeah, I mean, I'm very preoccupied.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.960
I'm not like a...

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.960
And then when I saw the statue of David,

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.960
this is true, I saw the statue of David.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.960
It's beautiful.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.960
It's huge and perfect.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.960
It's beautiful.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.960
And then this is true.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.960
I saw, then I read that he had

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:03.960
finished sculpting it

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.960
at the age of 29

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.960
and finished sculpting it.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.960
And this is true. I logged...

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.960
The first thing I did, I logged under the

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.960
wireless of the museum

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.960
and I canceled my pre-order of GTA 5.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.960
For real?

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.960
Yeah.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.960
But Camille, I will say,

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.960
in your defense,

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.960
back then,

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.960
a slab of marble

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.960
was a video game.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.960
Well, I...

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.960
You know what? David is my GTA 5.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.960
You're right.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.960
That's just him killing time.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.960
I went into the influence

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.960
to the Uffizi Gallery

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.960
where Bonacelli's

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.960
Primavera is,

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.960
which is Venus in the half-shell,

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.960
you see

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.960
a room after room after room after room

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.960
of just the things that you were allowed to paint back then,

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.960
religious themes. You just see Jesus and Mary,

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.960
Mary and Jesus, the Annunciation,

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.960
the Assumption and this and that.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.960
I don't know if that's a real thing,

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.960
it's just funny to me.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.960
It'd be a funny fate thing, the Assumption.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.960
It's a painting of a guy

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.960
Jesus just walked by him

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.960
outside of an ice cream shop

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.960
and the painting is capturing the moment of him going,

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.960
nah.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.960
That guy looked a lot like him

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.960
at Pinkberry earlier tonight.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.960
But you see all this stuff and it's all biblical,

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.960
biblical, biblical, biblical.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.960
It was illegal basically to paint anything else.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.960
And then you walk into a room

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.960
and I think it was for one of the Medici's

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.960
or something like that and there was a privately commissioned

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.960
thing that was humanist. It was like

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.960
mythology stuff, which is naked people

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.960
that weren't in the Bible, which is

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.960
like punk rock as can be.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.960
And you walk in and you see a naked woman

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.960
with sprites and cherubs and stuff

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.960
with human nudity and I just

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.960
plopped down in my chair

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.960
and it was like hearing

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.960
like

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.960
what a seminal

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.960
rock and roll record would have been

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.960
if you listened to Lawrence Walk all your life.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.960
Oh Jesus Christ, never mind the

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.960
bollocks was playing.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.960
But it's also beautiful

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.960
and I sat there and there was two other people

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.960
and there was a lot of people milling about

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.960
but there was two other people. There was an older woman

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.960
and a younger woman and the three of us

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.960
in about 15 minutes looked at each other

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.960
and we were all like not crying but like all

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.960
teared up and we all looked at each other

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.960
and just gave each other a look like

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.960
Jesus Christ.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.960
And we had this moment and we were like

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.960
yeah, I know. And we just sat there

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.960
and just dug it for a while.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.960
I've had this experience where I've turned a corner

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.960
in a museum in Cleveland one time

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.960
and saw a Cézanne painting that was half-finished

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.960
and what made me cry is you could see a thumbprint

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.960
on it and it was the most beautiful drawing

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.960
I've ever seen and it was half-finished

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.960
on it and I just like

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.960
completely came apart crying.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.960
When you see the David, there's like

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.960
six other huge marble blocks that

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.960
Da Vinci never finished.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.960
I mean Michelangelo never finished.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.960
She walked down the hallway. Yeah, so it's all these

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.960
blocks that and so it looks like

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.960
these figures are trying to escape from these

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.960
blocks. But you had like David prototypes,

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.960
is that what you were describing? No, after the David.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.960
This is the crazy thing, after the David

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.960
he was commissioned to make like these six other ones

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.960
and halfway through, this is true

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.960
the funding fell through. So when you

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:11.960
feel bad about like a guy who made

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:13.960
a great movie, like he can't get another

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.960
movie made, the movie was great. The guy

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.960
who made the statue of David

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.960
couldn't get his next statue done. So it's

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.960
like six of these and it's all like these

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.960
blocks and there's characters like that.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.960
He's sort of carved but not finished.

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.960
They look like they're trying to escape from this.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.960
I think in somebody who's an art student

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.960
correct me if I'm wrong, but I love when geniuses

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.960
describe the way they're geniuses like Bobby

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.960
Shaw, the way he talks about chess. Oh yeah,

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.960
Michelangelo said that

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.960
God put the image inside this block

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.960
of marble. I have just the

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.960
shitty task of removing the excess.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.960
Well, that's the thing is that if I was

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.960
a guy who was like, give me a tip on sculpting

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:51.960
and he said that, I'm like, you don't have to be a

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:53.960
dick about it. That's the thing

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.960
like that. That's something that drives me crazy

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.960
is I like, I want

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.960
to talk about like how passionate I

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.960
am about like, you know, making stuff,

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.960
but you do like when you run it through your head

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.960
because it does sound like stuff like that.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.960
Like you go like, I'm just going to sound

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.960
like the biggest dick in the world.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.960
But it's the most selfless stuff

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.960
because you're like, oh shit, like what are you going to say?

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.960
Like God wrote community episode

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.960
four at season two, you know.

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.960
Like it's not me, it's God.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.960
But the thing you want to communicate though

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.960
is the rapture like of

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.960
like the idea

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.960
that there's a creative

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.960
dimension and I think Campbell talked about

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.960
that there's shit outside of

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.960
you that's already done

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.960
and that you're

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.960
you get to participate

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.960
in the ether. Like you're just like

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.960
this weird splotch of iodine

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.960
that gets thrown onto a microscope slide

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.960
and reveals this thing that was already there.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.960
You might be a

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.960
hack like a good, like, you know,

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.960
it's like the middle of the road guy

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:53.960
like maybe just doing a sitcom. You might be

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.960
making like an industrial training video

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.960
in Pittsburgh about how to screw in a light bulb

01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.960
without getting electrocuted. You might be

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.960
doing the Sistine Chapel. Like it's different

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.960
different kinds of iodine, but like

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.960
it's all part of this like, you're just getting like

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.960
splats, you know, but it's like

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.960
it's the, it's like

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.960
mostly frustration. It's mostly

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.960
incompletion. It's like, I'm not

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.960
doing what I'm supposed to be doing and then like one second

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.960
every five years of like, oh

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.960
splat. I did it.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.960
I arrived. I'm

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.960
a sperm cell that got annihilated by this egg

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.960
and someone else gets a baby.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.960
And that's what's wonderful about being at the Louvre

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.960
is that it's all those

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.960
splats, one after the other.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.960
They're collecting all of the

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.960
splats. I never, I never

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.960
thought about it that way.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.960
It was like a Bucaki creation. It's like a big

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.960
collection of

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.960
of

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.960
really good paintings.

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.960
Episode 72, Dan Harmon

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.960
realizes what art is

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.960
and why museums are important.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.960
Wouldn't you take a listen?

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.960
What was hard for me was, so

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.960
I don't know anything about painting, but I was there

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.960
and I was having, I was having real connection

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.960
to it real and I realized like

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.960
music and painting are things

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.960
that you can really get someone

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.960
in the split second and just

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.960
grab them emotionally with writing

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.960
which is, you know, what we do

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.960
there's a, there's an intellectual component to it

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.960
so there's a little bit more processing going on

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.960
but with music or art

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.960
it can be so

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.960
almost animalistic. It feels like when you get it

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.960
like grab something inside you, no matter

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.960
what your background is and you just

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.960
like have this, you know, it really resonates.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.960
I was kind of like a little bummed

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.960
out seeing all this stuff and being like

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.960
I'll never do any of this. I mean it's not

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.960
it's not, it's amazing

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.960
that it resonates. I think, I think the one thing

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.960
you should take away from it as a pep talk

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.960
as an individual creative to another is that

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.960
you're, you're a, a tuned

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.960
enough antenna that you, that that

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.960
brought tears to you as a good sign. You're

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.960
not supposed to, you're not supposed to

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.960
walk in there and go like, let's find out how

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.960
I hold up. You're like, no, right now

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.960
it's the worst bar to try here.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.960
You're like, all right, DaVinci, let's

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.960
see what you got.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.960
But also like, all right, DaVinci on your best day

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.960
like not DaVinci on an open mic

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.960
working his shit out. But what's also

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.960
crazy is DaVinci was a scientist and after

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.960
he died they found plans for a helicopter

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.960
and for solar panels

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.960
and a calculator. But also for AIDS, also

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.960
for AIDS. They suppressed it.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.960
They suppressed it. Bit from Colomay.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.960
People think that DaVinci is so amazing

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.960
the helicopter, the jetpack, AIDS.

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.960
He designed AIDS and

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.960
no one will acknowledge that.

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.960
Are you, are you Jib-Jab and DaVinci?

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.960
Nothing is

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.960
sacred!

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.960
Wolf Pusser.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.960
Little sketches of AIDS. But it really is.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.960
Like he was like, next to the

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.960
next to the spiral.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.960
I want to, I want to go back to mail

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.960
to the unfinished, because I was

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.960
in that same room at the academia.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.960
Did you see those? Yeah.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.960
They do seem to be frozen

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.960
in the ice or emerging unsuccessfully.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.960
It's very visceral, seeing it.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.960
To lose funding. They already bought the marble.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.960
I

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.960
bet that's what those rich fuckers were betting on though.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.960
That's the thing that makes me happy about

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.960
hearing about the half-finished. David is that he had the balls

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.960
to walk away. Like

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.960
fuck you, fuck you man.

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.960
I bet that's what they thought. They probably

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.960
bet on his craftsmanship.

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.960
Like, why don't you just finish it anyway?

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.960
I'm working on getting a loan and he's like, fuck you.

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.960
I'll go carve another rock.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.960
He was like, I'll go make the Sistine Chapel

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.960
in Rome. And then he fucking did that.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.960
Because I saw that David and I was like, all right, everyone

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.960
can have one great day. What else

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.960
you got? Have you seen the Sistine Chapel?

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.960
You're like, oh, okay, I'll also this.

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:35.960
Also

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.960
this. Sistine Chapel got me

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.960
too. I looked up at the Senate. It's wonderful.

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.960
There's the

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.960
what's it the

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.960
Judgment Day on one wall and then you have the

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.960
God and Adam up there.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.960
That's the one you see a lot,

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.960
but that's like one fiftieth of the whole thing.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.960
Then aligning it are these giant

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.960
curved parts along the sides, like the railings

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.960
of the chapel. And they're huge.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.960
And he painted upside

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.960
down on a curved surface, things that

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.960
read absolutely two dimensionally.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.960
Like they don't look curved and they still

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.960
look three-dimensional surfaces. And that

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.960
was just demoralizing. Like that's

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.960
unbelievable. But I heard he stole

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.960
a lot of that stuff from the Sistine floor.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:15.960
And a lot of people

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.960
don't realize, you know, you never look down

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.960
when you go into that place, but it's

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.960
he took that. There's a guy named Harold

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.960
Johnson that did the Sistine floor

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.960
and it's gorgeous.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.960
And he did it first. They did the floor first.

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.960
It looks like perfect rectangles.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.960
That's what my friend was telling me.

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.960
You know, I went to the Louvre and she was telling me

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.960
like what to go see. And she was like, and then go see

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.960
the Mona Lisa, which is fine.

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.960
And I was like, you just whatever the Mona

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.960
Lisa. And I don't, now I don't feel as

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.960
bad about some of the comments

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.960
that people make about me online.

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.960
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.960
People are looking at the Mona Lisa.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.960
They should have a comment section.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.960
That would be an amazing experience.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.960
Just go and there's like, yeah, there just

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.960
be some guy goes, you've got a racist, you know,

01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.960
like under some thing.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:01.960
I saw the Mona Lisa.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.960
It's really small.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.960
People said that to me. It's really

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.960
small. I was like, that should make it

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:09.960
better. It's the biggest, it's the most

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.960
well-known portrait of all time.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.960
It's too small. It's a postage stamp, but that's

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.960
even better. Yeah, well, I just

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.960
think like whatever.

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.960
People said that to me.

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.960
Because she's smiling or not. I can't even tell.

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.960
Yeah.

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.960
That like really got. Will she, won't she?

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.960
Guys, I have one word for you.

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.960
Museum of Jurassic Technology.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.960
Oh yeah, that's great.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.960
Hey,

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:35.960
don't talk unless you have a microphone.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.960
Museum of Jurassic

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.960
Do you want to explain what that

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:41.960
have you been to the Museum of Jurassic

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.960
Technology? Yeah, I've heard about it.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.960
It's like an art installation. It's not

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.960
real, like

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.960
that real Jurassic technology. Yeah,

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.960
it's like it's an art installation.

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.960
Why do you love it? Have you been to the

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.960
roof? No.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.960
Whenever you go to a building, check out the

01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.960
roof first.

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:01.960
When you get there,

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.960
BJ will be there.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.960
And he will give you some

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.960
pinkberry.

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.960
And give you your next clue. Why?

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.960
Not everything is the

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:13.960
amazing race, bro.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.960
He's

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.960
he's been corrupted

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.960
by the amazing. Yeah, he thinks life is

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.960
like, all right. Where's my next clue?

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.960
What was the last time you cried?

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.960
It's the last time I cried.

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.960
I cry. The answer will

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.960
be absolutely unacceptable because the

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.960
answer will definitely be because I'm working on

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.960
a story.

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:35.960
Of my own. About my show.

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.960
About people going to community college.

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:39.960
But I cry.

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.960
I cry when

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.960
a story works.

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:45.960
It's not, it's like

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:47.960
I'll be going like,

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:49.960
and it's really embarrassing sometimes.

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.960
Like if I'm in a room full of writers and

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.960
I'll go like, well,

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:55.960
it's like, you know,

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.960
and that, oh no, that works perfectly because

01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:59.960
then Troy has to say goodbye to Abed.

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.960
But

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.960
I'll like, I'll like, I'll like just like

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.960
I'll hear my voice doing that. Like I feel

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.960
the, but it doesn't

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.960
that's a bad example because that sounds sad.

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.960
Like, but like, it's happening right now

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.960
a little bit. Well, because I can remember, I can have

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.960
sense memory of like what it feels like for a

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.960
story to finally something

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.960
that is not yielding

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:21.960
you know, something that because

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.960
stories

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.960
like, like when you're, when you're working on

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.960
them, you're working on this thing as I've talked about

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.960
it's like, oh, it's just not

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.960
it's, it's, it's kind of like

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.960
like, uh,

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.960
I don't know, like, like, like, like, like some

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.960
sappy movie about a kid in a horse or something

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.960
and it's like the horse doesn't want to eat out of the kid's hand

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.960
or something because it's like, so it's like this miraculous

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.960
moment when this thing is

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:45.960
behaving properly

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.960
because it's finally chosen you and it wants to do

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.960
something and you're like, like, Jesus fucking Christ.

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.960
I've been like, like, like

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.960
the pain that I've gone through

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.960
uh, uh, you

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.960
like, like, yeah, that's it

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.960
it's just, it's an emotional reaction

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.960
it's sort of like, there's a salt water

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.960
squirting out of your eyes

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.960
whether, whether what you

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.960
specifically broke was a truly

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.960
sad moment about a character loving

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.960
his father or something or just a fart joke

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.960
like it could really, if it clicks, it kind of like

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.960
is an emotional experience for me

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.960
catharsis

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.960
catharsis, yes, just yell anything out

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.960
laughter

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.960
laughter

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.960
I'm crying up here and you just

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.960
guys just connecting dots

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.960
verbally

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.960
that is, like, that's what

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.960
made me cry about that painting was that moment

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.960
when it, like, finally is like, oh, I'm done

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.960
and that's what you're talking about

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.960
is that moment where you're like, I mean

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.960
there's a lot more work to do but where you're like, oh, I did

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:43.960
something and this is

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.960
this works and it's beautiful

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.960
yeah

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.960
yeah, I wish

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:51.960
I could store all that information

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.960
so I could study it because like

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:55.960
what 80 plus whatever

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.960
episodes of

01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.960
community going through that process every time, there's been so

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.960
many, so many wasted tears

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.960
so many times when it's fun

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.960
like, we got it, we got it

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.960
feeling so good about something that

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:09.960
ends up being like, oh shit, this doesn't work

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.960
you know, it's funny, like

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.960
we toil at the feet

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.960
of this thing that just taunts us

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.960
you know

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.960
Jeff, do you want to answer?

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:21.960
about crying?

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.960
yeah

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:25.960
I took this huge shit

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:27.960
Jeff was like, I looked and it was 9-11

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.960
and I cried

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.960
I cried today

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.960
right before I came here

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.960
I was like, I cry about music a lot

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.960
I'm a crier, I'll cry

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.960
movies, I'll cry

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.960
like weather, like I get like kind of

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.960
overwhelmed by things, like if somebody strikes

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.960
me as incredibly singular

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.960
I just get really like overcome by stuff

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.960
I've always been one of those people

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.960
like if I get yelled at

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.960
when I was like bossed around on the playground

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.960
when I get angry, I think Dan we have the same thing

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.960
you get angry, my emotions well up

01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.960
and tears start falling

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.960
so I cry happy more than I cry sad

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.960
but I cry happy all the time

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.960
so today there's a song

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:07.960
called She by Charles Asnivore

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:09.960
Elvis Costello covered it

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.960
oh yeah, I've heard the Elvis Costello version

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.960
Jeff Lynn did an awesome version of it

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.960
and there's a lyric at the end of that

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.960
I just was singing it in my apartment

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.960
and I get to the end of it

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.960
and I can't even talk

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.960
I can't sing it, I can't even

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.960
my throat closes up

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.960
and it just makes me start crying

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.960
and what it is, it's just

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.960
beautifully written

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:33.960
and expresses it's a little turn that it makes

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.960
where it's not she, she, she, she

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.960
when it goes to me, then it goes

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.960
me, I'll take her laughter

01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.960
and her tears and make them all

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.960
my souvenirs and when it becomes

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.960
about like, this is the effect

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.960
that she has on me

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.960
then it becomes way more about she

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.960
every time, there's a lot of songs

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.960
I sing in the shower, all of a sudden

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.960
I just have to stop

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:57.960
I'm sobbing, like a music overwhelms me

01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.960
all the time

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.960
the album that always makes you cry

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.960
do you guys know Warren Zevon?

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.960
and everyone knows

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.960
I almost played a Warren Zevon song

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.960
his last time, he found out

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.960
he was going to die of lung cancer

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:13.960
and he was like, I gotta make a fucking album

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.960
before I die, so this album is like

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.960
goodbye to the world, it's called The Wind

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.960
and it is, it's so beautiful

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.960
because you can hear that he's very weak

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.960
and he has such a great

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.960
like, he's so at peace with it

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.960
like when he did the press conference

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:29.960
to announce that he was going to die in three months

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.960
he said, in his press conference

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:33.960
he said, I just want to live long

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.960
enough to see the new Bond movie

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.960
I hear they're taking it in a new direction

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:39.960
no pressure

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.960
and that was Christina Royale

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.960
so, they did

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.960
they took it in a new direction

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.960
special thanks, Warren Zevon

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.960
but that album was really, really good

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.960
this is one song called

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.960
keep me in your heart for a while

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.960
it's not like a grand thing, it's like

01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.960
I'm going to die soon, just keep me in your heart for a while

01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:59.960
just for a little bit

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.960
think of me every now, it's really wonderful

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.960
you know what I'm finding

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.960
I have a really crazy memory for lyrics

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:07.960
I remember songs I learned when I was a little kid

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.960
like, I did a lot of musical theater

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.960
I know all the lyrics

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.960
the ABCD song

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.960
same melody

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.960
somebody should get sued

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:19.960
but like

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.960
going back and listening to songs that you learned

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.960
when you were a kid and you didn't really

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.960
know what the meaning was about it

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.960
all of a sudden there's this little epiphany

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:29.960
that's what it's about

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.960
those moments really hit me right in the old days

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.960
I was a little kid and I loved four weddings in a funeral

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.960
and it wasn't until the 10th time I watched it

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.960
that I realized that those two characters were gay

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:39.960
and that like

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.960
changed my life

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.960
I was like, I guess they're not so bad

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.960
it's true, like you know

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.960
grew up very homophobic and stuff

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.960
because very religious and so

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.960
but that was part of the reason watching that movie

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.960
I was like, oh okay, people do whatever they want

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.960
I was watching West Side Story on TCM

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.960
like a few months ago

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.960
and I cried, like openly

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.960
alone at my place

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:03.960
but not at one of the sad songs

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.960
I want to be in America

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.960
you know why? because it's a fucking good number

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.960
it's a fucking good song

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.960
which one?

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.960
I want to be in America

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.960
fucking good! and the guy that plays

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.960
who's the sexy dude, what's his name?

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.960
Bernardo

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.960
he fucking rules, he's so good

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.960
and the music is great

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.960
and what's her name, Cheetah Rivera

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.960
it's just so good

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.960
it's like a triumphant moment

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.960
there's little things like that

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.960
that really fucking came together

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.960
there's a bunch of, that's 200 people making

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.960
something happen

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.960
that's another thing that always gets me

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.960
is when it's humanity working as one thing

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.960
like I went to a space shuttle launch and it's moving

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.960
there's like six people on that fucking thing

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.960
and like it's like

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.960
I was just sobbing crying

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.960
and there was a guy next to me and he's a colonel

01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.960
in the Air Force

01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.960
and he was sobbing crying

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:57.960
he had a friend on board that thing

01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.960
I thought he was gonna, he turned to you, suck it up pussy

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.960
let's get this bird in the air

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.960
we're not gonna do it with your tears

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.960
he's standing next to me

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.960
I knew, we had talked about it before

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.960
he goes, he's got a buddy on board this thing

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.960
it was like the last launch of Atlantis I think

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:13.960
or second to last, supposed to be the last

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.960
but they added one more I think

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.960
and so when it went up, I was just like

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.960
my jaw hit my chest and I was just streaming

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.960
not like, huh huh, crying

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.960
just a steady flow of tears

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.960
I've never really cried like that

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.960
it was just complete awe

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.960
it's so easy to think that

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.960
billions of years ago

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.960
there was a sun supernova

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:35.960
and one piece of dust or whatever settles

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.960
where Earth is and it just happens to spin and cool

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.960
the hot gases spin and spin for eons

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.960
and then they cool and it sort of forms

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.960
so that it just happens to be habitable

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:45.960
cut to us like launching shit into space

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.960
and next to me is this guy, he looks like the great Santini

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.960
he's a bad ass

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:51.960
pilot, test pilot

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.960
tough guy, ex astronaut

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.960
and I know he's got a buddy on board

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.960
and he's very sunflower about it

01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.960
and he was saying like

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.960
people don't really cheer

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.960
just so you know, when it launches

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.960
a lot of people cheer but the people that have been to these before

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.960
they don't cheer until the solid rocket boosters detach

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.960
because when those are still lit

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.960
and they're still attached to it, anything can go wrong

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.960
and there's no way to abort it

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:15.960
once they release, there's a possible way things go wrong

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.960
to have them return to the land side

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.960
they're going into space against God

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.960
and things can go wrong

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.960
and they're strapped to a bomb

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:25.960
and they can't turn off until those run off

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.960
and once the SRB is detached

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.960
then there's a way for them to nose over

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.960
and do a return to landing site

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.960
which has never been done thank God

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:35.960
did you tell him that there's a traditional

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.960
there's things that can go wrong when you're telling people how to cheer

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.960
I was asking him a million questions

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.960
I wanted to know

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.960
that was unsolicited, I'm sorry

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.960
he was just saying

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.960
I said how many of these have you been to

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.960
then I find out that he's a pilot

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:51.960
and he's got a buddy on board

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.960
and he's like

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:55.960
were you here for the Challenger

01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.960
he goes yes I was, we talked about that

01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.960
and so that's when he's saying

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.960
since then we don't cheer until the SRBs are released

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.960
and I go

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:05.960
wow, and so when I was having my own moments

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:07.960
and I'm filming it very poorly

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.960
on my iPhone

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.960
we're just like not looking through it

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:13.960
but holding it up kind of in the direction of it

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.960
and I'm crying and I look over

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.960
the thing that got me, among all the things

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.960
was this guy, it was going

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:21.960
go up Lannis

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.960
like crying

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.960
he's like make it

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.960
and everybody there, I'll start crying now

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.960
it's friends and family going

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:31.960
get those fucking solid rockabusters off

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.960
and make it

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.960
and it was just like

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:37.960
there's something incredibly

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:39.960
like

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:41.960
we get so irritated by little things humans do

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.960
and I'm such a road ragey

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.960
cock on the road and stuff like that

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:47.960
everything's irritable and Rush can go fuck himself

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.960
but you don't want Rush can go fuck himself

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.960
I know, I know

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.960
but the thing is the beauty of

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.960
it doesn't have to be people going into space

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.960
which is the craziest thing in the world

01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:59.960
but it's just crazy to go like

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:01.960
it's a very

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.960
human moment

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:05.960
where I just go like we're awesome

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.960
we're really cool and we have so much

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.960
mental capacity and it's very

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.960
difficult to do all the things we do

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.960
I don't know how you put lead in the fucking pencil

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.960
but there's heroic shit that goes

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.960
on to every little thing that we do

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.960
and it doesn't have to be going into space to make you realize that

01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:21.960
but there's so much

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.960
natural heroism

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:25.960
that that's the stuff that always

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.960
gets me and then you realize

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.960
how brief it all is

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.960
that's the beauty of it

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.960
so that's why sunsets are set

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:37.960
one day closer to death, it really is

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:39.960
I think that's genuinely part of the reason

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:41.960
I think seasons

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:43.960
are very

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.960
I always connected to seasons

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.960
when I was in Chicago and stuff and I feel

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.960
like part of the reason that California

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.960
people can be so cocky and get all

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.960
that work done and stuff is like

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.960
they don't see

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.960
seasons, they don't see like life

01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.960
dying and coming back and dying and coming back

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.960
so then one day they look in the mirror and they're like

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.960
I look slightly old, what the fuck

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.960
happened and then they get like work done and stuff

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.960
and I really think

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.960
seasons give you perspective that

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.960
like you know we sort of

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.960
don't have something, I was thinking about this today

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.960
this is slightly off topic but not really

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.960
off topic

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.960
we all know who the first man on the moon was

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.960
how many people know who the first man in space

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.960
was

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.960
okay like four people, his name is Yuri Gagarin

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.960
and just because he was Russian

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.960
we don't hear about him as much, to me that's

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.960
really sad because that's something again that humanity

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.960
did, it was in the fucking 60s

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.960
the first man in space, everyone

01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.960
should know his name and we don't know

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.960
it just because it's a Russian

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:43.960
and they didn't like Russia back then

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:45.960
it's like, it's like bombs me up

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.960
Anatoly, have you met Anatoly

01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.960
was he here before you left? Yes, I've met Anatoly

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:51.960
our resident Russian

01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.960
about Gagarin

01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.960
mostly

01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.960
actually about me, Gagarin

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.960
I knew it, this is the least surprising thing

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.960
Gagarin

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.960
here was studied

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.960
in a city where I grew up

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.960
oh wow

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.960
obviously four people raised their hands

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:17.960
one of them was the guy who grew up in the same city as him

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.960
that's the name that we should know

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:21.960
are there big statues of him in town?

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:23.960
that's great

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.960
it's him punching Neil Armstrong in the face

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:29.960
I think everybody knows

01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:31.960
Yuri Gagarin was the first guy in space

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:33.960
I think maybe because you asked it that way

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:35.960
people

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.960
paused and was like, maybe it wasn't Yuri Gagarin

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:39.960
a lot of people didn't know

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.960
well, because I grew up during the

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.960
when I learned that it was the Cold War

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.960
so we were supposed to

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.960
maybe they just passed it

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.960
they were like, space, fuck that

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.960
that is a bummer that wouldn't have happened

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.960
what about that dog?

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.960
the first thing was a Russian dog

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.960
it was two dogs

01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.960
and they were called

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.960
Belka and Strelka

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.960
those really

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:05.960
you made a thing that goes into space

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:07.960
you could name dogs two different things

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.960
Rover and Schmover

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:17.960
now those dogs and

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.960
I'm asking like he was there

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:21.960
those dogs

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.960
they didn't come back, right?

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:25.960
there's no like

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.960
imagine those dogs

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:29.960
they're well trained enough

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.960
that they're like

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.960
I imagine those are the best dogs on the planet

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:35.960
the best dogs

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:37.960
whatever you want boss

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:39.960
I have a question

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:41.960
for all the American space program

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:43.960
I forget what the number is

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:45.960
but it's below 20 I think

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:47.960
the two shuttle things

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.960
in the beginning of the Apollo

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.960
how many Russian

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:53.960
cosmonauts died?

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:55.960
does that mean they don't release that?

01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.960
some fuckers died

01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:59.960
I don't know the number

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:01.960
that'd be interesting to find out

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.960
it was like 20 some here

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.960
I forget the number

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.960
but it's like 18 or something like that

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.960
around there of Americans that died

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:11.960
through our space program

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.960
which is pretty crazy when you think of the amount

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:15.960
there's been something like 160 or 70 or 80

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:17.960
space shuttle missions or something like that

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.960
the amount of people that died

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:21.960
making the Golden Gate Bridge

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:23.960
the amount of people that died from poverty

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.960
and you think

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.960
flinging us into space

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.960
would have the highest casualty

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.960
looking at the moon and being like

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:33.960
let's go there

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.960
people are gonna die

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.960
cause of a lot of death

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:39.960
I'm gonna get all the numbers wrong so forgive me

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.960
but I think maybe seven people died

01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:43.960
in the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.960
which was considered an engineering marvel

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:47.960
the rule of thumb back then was

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.960
one person dead for every 100 foot of span

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:51.960
that was considered

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.960
feasible and okay insurance wise

01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:55.960
the fact that only

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.960
seven people died and held like 1300 feet

01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:59.960
or more than that

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.960
that was considered like we did it

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.960
we put fuckers in the moon

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.960
and only three people had died

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.960
I hate to be cynical

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.960
but it's really expensive

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.960
to kill an astronaut

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:13.960
it's a lot of training

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:15.960
a poor guy can die making a bridge

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:17.960
and that's what it is

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.960
that's why I'm wondering what I'm ranting about

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:21.960
that's a danger of capitalism

01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:23.960
where it's worth something

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:25.960
it's great and gets all kinds of shit done

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.960
but unfucking capped

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.960
without some rule about it

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:31.960
that a human life

01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:33.960
is absolutely

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.960
not only worth more than anything

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.960
but that the president's

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.960
human life is actually worth

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.960
we can wrap our brain around this

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:43.960
the president's human life is worth the exact same amount

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:45.960
it's like the guy

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:47.960
whose breath is terrible

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.960
to the cubicle next to you

01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:51.960
that looks creepy outside the 7-11

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:53.960
you don't have to want to be his best friend

01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:55.960
but the idea that his human life

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.960
is actually it's all equivalent

01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.960
all we have to do is put that

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:01.960
in place over capitalism

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.960
let capitalism run under it

01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:05.960
you wouldn't have stuff like that

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.960
by the way, Anatoly's wearing the cat shirt

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.960
from the sexy guy

01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:11.960
anybody else wearing the cat shirt

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.960
from last week?

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.960
what's the cat shirt story?

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:17.960
there was a gentleman named Andrew

01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:19.960
a guy who was last week

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:21.960
we mentioned him

01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:23.960
he just goes to different cities trying to get people to wear that shirt

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:25.960
he was in the front row and he was in a wheelchair

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:27.960
with arm brace crutches

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:29.960
and he had that shirt on

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.960
so we started talking to him and he has Tourette's

01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:33.960
and he's kind of got a spinal thing for 11 years

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:35.960
and we talked to him

01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:37.960
and Aaron fell in love with his cat shirts

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:39.960
so it's become something of a craze online

01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.960
we've run rampant

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.960
BJ, do you know where we are?

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.960
yeah, cat shirts

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:47.960
it's time to bring Spencer out

01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:57.960
we had a lot of catching up to do

01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.960
I'm curious to find out on Reddit

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:01.960
whether this is the best or worst episode in a while

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.960
it's had a lot of stuff

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:05.960
this episode has had everything

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.960
but I think that

01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:09.960
we've settled into an audience

01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.960
where it's like

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:15.960
my mom would listen to the home shopping network

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:17.960
while she's sewed

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:19.960
in the 80s

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.960
I would come home from school

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.960
my mom wasn't buying anything because we were poor

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:25.960
but she would sit there and sew stuff

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:27.960
and she would have the home shopping network on

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:29.960
because she had grown addicted to the voices

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:31.960
this is the people like oh Diane

01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:33.960
she gives you a toot every time you order a bracelet

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.960
she's just listening to Diane talk about

01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:37.960
it's like if you listen to people for hours a day

01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.960
you think that's what we've been reduced to?

01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:41.960
it's not reduced, elevated to

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:43.960
we're in their lives, we're their family

01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:45.960
if I cut my finger right now

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:47.960
someone in Illinois would be like oh he cut his finger

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:49.960
also they are listening

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:51.960
it's not just that they're listening to the songs

01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:53.960
that our voices make

01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:55.960
they're engaged

01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:57.960
hi Diane in Illinois

01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:59.960
are you chopping your salad

01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:01.960
hey Gary drive safe this morning

01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:03.960
all right Camille

01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:05.960
two speed round

01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:07.960
you have two BJ questions left

01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:09.960
this is the first question

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.960
hi Spencer Howard

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.960
hey guys

01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.960
continue

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.960
do you want to answer the question?

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:23.960
no, continue

01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.960
two quick questions

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:27.960
do you believe in God?

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:29.960
yes

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.960
I also cried during that home depot video

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:33.960
were the guys proposing to that other guy

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.960
I don't know this video

01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:37.960
how's it go?

01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:39.960
he's like

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.960
he's demonstrating

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:47.960
I have to come up with you?

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:49.960
and then imagine

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:51.960
all these people are dancing

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:53.960
and you're the guy

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.960
okay

01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:57.960
wait now I should be the guy

01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:59.960
you should be the guy who's proposing to me

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:03.960
wait you

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:05.960
you did improv

01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:17.960
I'm the guy or the girl?

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:19.960
you're a guy

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:21.960
we're in home depot

01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:23.960
all of our friends are back here dancing

01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:25.960
they're all dancing at the home depot

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:27.960
and then a bunch of kids walk in

01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:29.960
with iPads

01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:31.960
and start pulling them up

01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:33.960
and then here's someone you know

01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:35.960
face chatting you from somewhere else in America

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:37.960
or around the world

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:39.960
and you're like oh hi relatives

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.960
good to see you on the iPad

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.960
and then your fiance guy walks up

01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:45.960
your fiance guy walks up

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:47.960
because you're about to get married to a guy

01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:49.960
oh

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:53.960
come

01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:55.960
come on

01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:59.960
you've made me so happy

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.960
will you make the rest of my life

01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:05.960
the happiest life

01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:07.960
that I will ever have

01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.960
I do

01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:17.960
Jeff and BJ are both really actually crying

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.960
you just gave me your home depot card

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:25.960
BJ everybody thank you sir

01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:29.960
magic

01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:31.960
let's bring Erin McGathy up to the stage

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:33.960
Erin

01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:35.960
I got a little cheered up

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:37.960
I'm interpreting that correctly

01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:39.960
it's a viral video

01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:41.960
it's a same sex couple

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:43.960
proposal

01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:45.960
it certainly wasn't our reenactment

01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.960
cause it felt like a little golden railroad spike

01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.960
I imagine my mom watching that

01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:55.960
then

01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:57.960
when going like oh that's how you win

01:34:57.960 --> 01:34:59.960
those are the victories

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.960
when my mom goes like oh

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.960
they're just like us

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:05.960
that makes me cry

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:07.960
seeing the romance

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.960
if you could drag your mom to a gay wedding

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.960
this issue would be over

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:13.960
because believe me they're more romantic

01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:15.960
we've talked about it

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:17.960
hello Erin

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:19.960
did you get your hair colored

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:21.960
is that new hair

01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.960
it's a little too purpley

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:25.960
I don't think it's purpley

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.960
it worked

01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:33.960
I feel like a fool now

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:35.960
real quick because we're getting late on time

01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:37.960
Erin last time you cried

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:39.960
I cry all the time

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:41.960
constantly

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:43.960
the last time I really sobbed

01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:45.960
was watching the Stella sisters

01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:47.960
who are on Nashville

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:49.960
oh yeah

01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:51.960
we've talked about this

01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:53.960
these two little girls, Lennon and Maisie Stella

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:55.960
they're sisters and they sing a cappella

01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:57.960
and the way that they look at it

01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.960
if I start talking about it I'll cry

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:01.960
two and three

01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:03.960
they're not two and three

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.960
they're like six and ten or eight and ten

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.960
they're playing with like two tins of margarine

01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:09.960
as percussion

01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:11.960
they're probably in their forties now

01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:13.960
but they've been around

01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:15.960
not literally

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:17.960
they carry each other

01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:19.960
makes me sob

01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.960
but also paintings and

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:23.960
Dan you want to grab the character sheets

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.960
and let's get this underway

01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:27.960
we have precious little time for Spencer and D

01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:29.960
let's lightening through this D&D

01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.960
we had to catch Christopher up on his recent exploits

01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:33.960
tell me real quick what happened

01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:35.960
do you do that

01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:37.960
I don't really say any Christopher

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:39.960
specific things I don't think

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.960
I think you can jump right back in

01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:43.960
we have a skeleton army

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:45.960
I was there for that

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:47.960
I was there for their dance routine

01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:49.960
we fought a bunch of blob monsters

01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:51.960
and googas and I think it's all pretty

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.960
self-explanatory

01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:55.960
alright Spencer

01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:57.960
what

01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:59.960
take it away

01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:01.960
okay

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:03.960
you have a ribbon knife now do you know about that

01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:05.960
I mean

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.960
what

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:09.960
you have a knife that already

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.960
you guys

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:13.960
come to your tagger I guess

01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.960
I have a new story for the last time

01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:17.960
I cried

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:25.960
oh okay

01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:27.960
on the last episode of Harmontown

01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:29.960
our heroes were still

01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:31.960
in the depths of Admiral Darkstar's

01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:33.960
Black Keep

01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.960
after trekking north to lay a final

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:37.960
siege on the menacing marauder our heroes

01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:39.960
fell prey to Darkstar's illusionary

01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:41.960
fences and were trapped within its icy clutches

01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:43.960
after reuniting

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:45.960
the party defeated a snowflake

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.960
and then charged up some stairs

01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.960
encountering a porcupine in front

01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:51.960
of a room full of buttons

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.960
after dispatching the hellish

01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:55.960
hedgehog our heroes set to work

01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:57.960
pressing buttons and releasing terribly dangerous

01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:59.960
fluids until they stumbled

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:01.960
across one that unleashed the 23

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.960
flavors of refreshing

01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.960
satisfaction that is Dr Pepper

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:07.960
filling the room with Dr Pepper

01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:09.960
our heroes floated up

01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.960
towards a hole in the ceiling

01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:13.960
in the sticky effervescent embrace

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:15.960
of success and the taste that

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:17.960
Amazon site reviews call

01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:19.960
great tasting

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.960
the party crawled out of the hole

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:23.960
and onto the floor of a great hall

01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:25.960
in a great metal castle

01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:27.960
they were in the Black Keep

01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:29.960
but what would they do

01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:31.960
I don't know

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:35.960
thank you Spencer

01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:37.960
Spencer Crint, then as always

01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:39.960
brought to you by Dr Pepper

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.960
100% immersion

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:45.960
I'm just calling it out

01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.960
yeah so you guys

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:49.960
crawl into the hall of the Dark Keep

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:51.960
after you exit from

01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:53.960
this hole you feel the nurturing

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.960
Dr Pepper has healed you

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:57.960
you regain all your lost hit points

01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:59.960
okay

01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:01.960
alright

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:03.960
wow I feel so refreshed

01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:05.960
me too

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:07.960
I'm more of a Mr. Pip Guy

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:11.960
it's Pib Extra now

01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.960
oh is it? yeah

01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:17.960
you guys

01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:19.960
you guys and gal we finally made it

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.960
this is the Dark Keep, this is the stronghold

01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:23.960
of Admiral Darkstar

01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:25.960
it's quiet

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.960
too quiet

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:29.960
scared

01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:31.960
I cast light

01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:33.960
it lights up

01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:35.960
wait what do you cast it on

01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:37.960
my finger

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:39.960
it lights up

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:43.960
are you holding it to try and look around

01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:45.960
yeah okay

01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:47.960
examine my surroundings

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:49.960
you can see there's a large double door

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.960
to what I'm going to call for sake of reference

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.960
the south of this room

01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:55.960
you also see a wooden door on the east

01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:57.960
staircase leading from the north

01:39:57.960 --> 01:39:59.960
you just crawled out of a hole roughly in the center

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.960
out of the same hole

01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:03.960
you see your skeletons

01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:05.960
that you've been amassing

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:07.960
they float to the top and start to pull themselves

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:09.960
out of the Dr. Pepper

01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:11.960
do we still have all 50 of our skeletons?

01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:13.960
would you like to count them?

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:17.960
I count skeletons

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.960
you only count 46 somehow

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:21.960
okay

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:23.960
you're going to make an omelet

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:25.960
or recount

01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:27.960
46

01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:29.960
I'm sorry I doubted you

01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:33.960
I was hoping you were wrong

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.960
I didn't want to think

01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:37.960
what happened we lost you and you and Louis and Scrooge

01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:41.960
fellas

01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:43.960
that staircase I guess should be the first thing we go

01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:45.960
we check out

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.960
but behind you you hear the double doors flying open

01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:49.960
wow

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.960
out charges a well armored warrior

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:53.960
he's dazzling gold and he wears a great green cape

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.960
and clutches a blue gem on a rope

01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:57.960
in one hand

01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:59.960
speak at your name and intention

01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:01.960
I am light finger

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.960
that's not true

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.960
my name's Sharpie I don't want to start

01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:07.960
a relationship with a lie

01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:09.960
as he dashes in the room

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.960
and looks at your glowing finger

01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:13.960
he says asmodeus is pissant demons

01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:15.960
leave now

01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:17.960
or die where you stand

01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:19.960
you have us wrong

01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.960
my friend none of us are pissants

01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:23.960
my finger is only

01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:25.960
illuminated from the power

01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:27.960
of truth

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:29.960
the devil's illusions work

01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:31.960
great tricks on my mind

01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:33.960
hey look into my eyes

01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:35.960
do you see a devil's illusion right now

01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:37.960
yes

01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:39.960
okay look into my eyes do you see

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.960
a devil's illusion now

01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:43.960
not as much

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:45.960
alright work

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.960
we go down the circle

01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:49.960
we go down the line

01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:51.960
it's still about the same

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:53.960
okay what does his face look like

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:55.960
he looks it's gleaming

01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:57.960
and bright he has

01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:59.960
like a plus sign

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:01.960
that's just glowing on his face it's weird

01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:03.960
listen how many

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:05.960
people have you encountered

01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:07.960
since your travels here

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:09.960
that have told you that they're here to destroy

01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:11.960
Admiral Darkstar the last room

01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:13.960
was full of people such as that

01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.960
and they turned on you and I destroyed them

01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:17.960
okay

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:19.960
did you really check your math

01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:21.960
before you destroyed them because

01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:23.960
you're in the black keep of Admiral Darkstar

01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:25.960
that makes you one of his dark minions

01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:27.960
yeah but it hasn't turned out to be

01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:29.960
that deceptive a place you know

01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:31.960
it's sort of like hey I'm in an ice pit

01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:33.960
oh I'm in a soda room like

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:35.960

01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:37.960
no it's not

01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:39.960
that's your experience man

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:43.960
but yours has been one of like

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:45.960
holy shit like a hall of psychological

01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:47.960
mirrors like you've been running into people

01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:49.960
that seem like they're cool and then turn out they're not

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.960
yes and this seems like it's the third

01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:53.960
in a three trial set

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:55.960
no no no no no

01:42:57.960 --> 01:42:59.960

01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:05.960
ask us questions and we'll answer

01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:07.960
our answers will prove that we're not

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:09.960
the demons may I speak on behalf of

01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:11.960

really really cool by the way

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:21.960
I've been thinking about getting one of those quest signs

01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:23.960
on my head so that's

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:25.960

01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:41.960
this and I get on my knees

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.960
and I open my throat

01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:45.960

can we have a sidebar

01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:53.960
no that's what demons do

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:55.960
we know this guy

01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:57.960
proof that we're not demons because he's had

01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.960
two encounters

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:01.960
with demons so now

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:03.960
everyone in the world has to bend over

01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:05.960
backwards for him

01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:07.960
well fine fucking cut my head off

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:09.960
or let's move on

01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:11.960
can I just do a sense motive

01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:13.960
on callous I mean sure

01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:15.960
okay I try to sense motive on him

01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:17.960
his motive is to

01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:19.960
defeat all the demons and dark stars

01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:21.960
rain so he's a good guy

01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:23.960
as far as I can tell I'm still doing it I'm waiting

01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:25.960
I mean you remember time is money

01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:27.960
callous

01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:29.960
this is a good point I don't think any demons

01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:31.960
have done this before Jesus

01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:33.960
Christ I get

01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:35.960
up and dust myself off in that really aggressive

01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:37.960
way

01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:39.960
fucking

01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:41.960
A and I just I walk past him

01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:43.960
through the doors

01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:45.960
and I mutter as I just

01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:47.960
trails off as I fucking people halt

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:49.960
hey I'm sorry excuse me what

01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:51.960
just because you aren't demons

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:53.960
doesn't mean that you're good people

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:55.960
I was just

01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:57.960
thinking the same thing about you yeah

01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:59.960
as a paladin it is

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.960
my job to wipe out all evil

01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:03.960
not just demons

01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:05.960
new paladin customers

01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:07.960
seem pretty rough

01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.960
yeah no we're good guys

01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:11.960
I use my diplomacy and I look into his eyes

01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:13.960
and I

01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:15.960
take out my rope

01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:17.960
and I tie it

01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:19.960
to my

01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:21.960
bedroll

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:23.960
and I

01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:25.960
I look to my

01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:27.960
pals and give them a like

01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:29.960
it's gonna be fine

01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:31.960
I look confused

01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:33.960
we give her the look

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.960
we normally give her when she gets out

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:37.960
one of her arts and crafts

01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:39.960
I

01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:41.960
mouth I'm sorry to the guy

01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:47.960
I look at him

01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:49.960
and use my diplomacy he kind of goes

01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:51.960
we're not that tough

01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:53.960
I've known better than to take a trapped

01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:55.960
item before

01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:57.960
I use my diplomacy and I say

01:45:57.960 --> 01:45:59.960
callous I offer

01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.960
you this bedroll

01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:03.960
and a rope representing the

01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:05.960
tie to

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:07.960
our home

01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:09.960
that we are making

01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:11.960
vulnerable if we weren't

01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:13.960
good would we put up with this shit

01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:21.960
I guess you're right

01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:25.960
well then let's team up and work together

01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:27.960
you seem like a tough paladin let's go and do

01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:29.960
this thing

01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:31.960
okay all right

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:33.960

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:41.960
this is let it go

01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:49.960
last time you went on one of these

01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:51.960
you got stepped on by a giant

01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:53.960
a healing choir of

01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:55.960
that's not immersion

01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:57.960

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:05.960
all right

he wants to fight

01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:09.960
the demons but he wants to find the best allies

01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.960

why do you want to defeat Admiral

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:15.960
Darkstar because the shard

01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.960
of truth tells me so

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:19.960
fair enough

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:21.960

a skeleton army I'm pretty

01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:17.960
sure not pretty sure I know

01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:19.960
for a fact that skeletons cannot be

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.960
created without great evil being done

01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:23.960
we made a deal with a frost giant

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:25.960
who uh who said that

01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:27.960
you know we could team up and he didn't

01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:29.960
really help us a lot he tried to kill us all

01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:31.960
you've contracted with a dark force nope

01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:33.960
he's not a dark force have you been to

01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:35.960
forinheim the frozen

01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:37.960
city I've

01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:39.960
heard tell of such a city

01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:41.960
they're not great people either

01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:43.960
but they're not dark

01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:45.960
yeah they killed him but then they brought him

01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:47.960
it's all we did a busby Berkeley musical it's a whole

01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:49.960
thing you don't need to get into I go over

01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:51.960
and they were undead

01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:53.960
our skeletons are

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.960
no listen it came out wrong

01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:57.960
he's uh

01:48:57.960 --> 01:48:59.960
yes our skeletons are undead

01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:01.960
to doi they're skeletons

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:03.960
and they're moving around your compatriots

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.960
and you were once dead okay all right

01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:07.960
I was wrong I was dying

01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:09.960
he was dying he was so almost dead

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:11.960
I'm dead inside

01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:13.960
I had a dad like you

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:15.960
okay

01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:17.960
sharpie

01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:19.960
leave it we don't

01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:21.960
not looking at him

01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:23.960
not looking at him

01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:25.960
I walk over and examine the eastern door

01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:27.960
the eastern door

01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:29.960
you go over to the examine the eastern door

01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:31.960
and he's like

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:33.960
I wouldn't go there

01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.960
okay let's take his words

01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:37.960
what do you know about the eastern door callus

01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:39.960
demons roast on the east

01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:41.960
well if they're roasting

01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:43.960
that's good well I mean they're eating

01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:45.960
oh okay

01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.960
I thought they were being roasted

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:49.960
no no they do the roasting

01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.960
so the objective callus is to go to the demon list door

01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:53.960
I don't know

01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:55.960
which doors have you been to so far

01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:57.960
which area have you not explored

01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:59.960
I just know the east

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:01.960
I go to the southern door

01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:03.960
that's where I came out of

01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:05.960
all right Jesus you just said

01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:07.960
listen

01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:09.960
I'm on your side no sharpie

01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:11.960
no no no

01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.960
this alliance is uneasy

01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:15.960
I do a big sarcastic

01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:17.960
tiptoe over to the northern door

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:19.960
is this okay

01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:21.960
and then I laugh

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:23.960
he's so funny

01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:25.960
he

01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:27.960
he does a

01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:29.960
respond okay I examine

01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:31.960
I do it like a perception check on that door

01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:33.960
there's a large handle

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.960
I try

01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:37.960
I try the handle

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:39.960
you try the handle and as you grab it

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.960
you feel a sharp prick

01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:43.960
you pull your hand away and you see a needle

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:45.960
is poked out of the door

01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:47.960
and stabbed you in the hand

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:49.960
retracting in the door

01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:51.960
this perception check should have showed you

01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:53.960
that there was a needle on it

01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:55.960
it just showed me there was a handle

01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:57.960
it just popped out recently

01:50:57.960 --> 01:50:59.960
am I cut?

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.960
are you talking about the northern door or the western door

01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:03.960
the northern door

01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:05.960
what's your fortitude saved there

01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:07.960
my fortitude is

01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:09.960
alright

01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:11.960
everything's fine

01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:13.960
hey guys

01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:15.960
this door has a needle on it

01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:17.960
but I feel like I dodged a bullet on this one

01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:19.960
can I go grab it

01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:21.960
but not where the needle comes out of

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:23.960
like the different part of the handle

01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:25.960
because it's clearly an important door

01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:27.960
if it's protected by a needle

01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:29.960
so I grab the other part of it

01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:31.960
and I open it

01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:33.960
okay

01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:35.960
you see stairs that go up

01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:37.960
guys

01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:39.960
do you want to go up some stairs?

01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:41.960
what do you think Callis?

01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:43.960
I think I'm going through the other door

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:45.960
which door is that?

01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:47.960
the west

01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:49.960
you're going through the west door

01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:51.960
I'm going there now

01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:53.960
why?

01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:55.960
because you guys don't know what you're doing

01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.960
oh do you?

01:51:57.960 --> 01:51:59.960
can we be your minions then?

01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:01.960
he starts stomping towards this western door

01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:03.960
I stomped after him

01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:05.960
stomping

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:07.960
he throws open the door

01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:09.960
is there a needle on it?

01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:11.960
inside is nothing but darkness

01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:13.960
yeah

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:15.960
good choice Callis

01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:17.960
tasty pick

01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:19.960
he stops

01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:21.960
he gulps a bit and he's like

01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:23.960
you guys suck

01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:25.960
you don't know what's up

01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:27.960
I'm going through this door

01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:29.960
and you guys can't come

01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:31.960
what? we can't come

01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:33.960
he just threw the door and slams it shut

01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:35.960
alright you know what?

01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:37.960
I think that was Admiral Darkstar in disguise

01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:39.960
oh shit

01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:41.960
you hear blood curdling screams

01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:43.960
no

01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:45.960
he's a red shirt

01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:47.960
sorry I have metagaming

01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:49.960
let's go up the stairs of the other door

01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:51.960
the northern door

01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:53.960
you begin heading up the stairs but they seem longer

01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:55.960
than intended

01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:57.960
as if it might take a whole week to fight

01:52:57.960 --> 01:52:59.960
cliffhanger

01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:01.960
