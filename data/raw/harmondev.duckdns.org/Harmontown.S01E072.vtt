{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:15.000\nOh, yeah. I'm in that kind of mood, you guys. A hardcore mood.\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:22.000\nIt's time for the five most magical of words. Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:29.000\nPlease welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown.\n\n00:29.000 --> 00:35.000\nEverybody, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:42.000\nThank you very much. What a warm welcome.\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:45.000\nAll right. We've got some guests. We've got some guests tonight.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:48.000\nI was at the Creative Arts Emmys tonight.\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:52.000\nDid a little presentation with Joel McHale.\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:58.000\nI don't think there's anything to talk about there. It was fun at the Nokia Theater.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:01.000\nI own a tux now. I finally bought a tux, so I don't keep renting them.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:03.000\nIs that televised or non-televised?\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:08.000\nIt'll be televised on the FXX network. FX has now created an FXX network.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:11.000\nSo it's non-televised.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:17.000\nI mean, you know, from what I've heard, actually, you'd think it was just sort of like,\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:22.000\nlet's just start another thing like MTV2 or whatever, but it sounds like LandGraph,\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:27.000\nwho's the genius, one of the few suits that I really respect and love,\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:30.000\nand LandGraph over at FXX.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:33.000\nIt sounds like he's moving all the comedy over to FXX.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:38.000\nThat's what I've heard, because he wants FX to be associated with their dramas.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:41.000\nI mean, they're fucking, they're murdering it over there.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:45.000\nThat guy is like really, and Nick Grad and the people that work at FXX,\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:50.000\nthey're a true scientific demonstration of the fact that it's not just bullshit when you say,\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:54.000\nhey, just be creatively respectful to the creatives and stay out of their way,\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:57.000\nlike make deals with the people you want to work with.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:00.000\nThey pay lip service to that philosophy and they execute it.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:02.000\nThey only help.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:04.000\nThey say, look, we're not giving you a ton of money.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:06.000\nYou can do whatever you want here.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:09.000\nAnd look at all the programming on FX. It's fucking amazing.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:11.000\nThey went all kinds of awards. I don't know, whatever.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:14.000\nI can't suck their little wieners enough.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:17.000\nNow I call them little wieners.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nI wanted to colloquialize it a little more.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:22.000\nI accidentally said they had little wieners.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:25.000\nThat'll be, now that'll be the quote in the headline.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:29.000\nDan Harmon bashes jabs, flip flops.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:31.000\nDan Harmon took a shot at.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\nDan Harmon jab dibs.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:35.000\nDan Harmon bashes.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:40.000\nDan Harmon peen, pan, boom, bow.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:42.000\nIt's like I'm a professional wrestler.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:44.000\nLike I just say things.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:45.000\nJust go, can I have an omelet?\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:48.000\nDan Harmon jabs omelets.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:50.000\nYeah, well, I need to eat it.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:52.000\nI had to eat it. I had to put a fork in it.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:56.000\nDan Harmon sticks it, sticks it to his omelet.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.000\nClick here for the details.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:00.000\nOh, could I have a little, a little penny for my Bacardi ad?\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:03.000\nWill you click in it?\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:05.000\nI don't even know what songs you're here reading about\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:11.000\nhow Dan Harmon jabs and jabs.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:13.000\nWhat is the difference between a jib and a jab?\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:15.000\nI'm not sure.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:17.000\nIt doesn't matter, man.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:19.000\nDid you wear your eye Harmon with your tuxedo?\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:20.000\nNo.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:25.000\nNow, Dan, that's an opportunity to fucking market the eye Harmon.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:29.000\nIt would have been badass of me or whatever the opposite of badass is\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:32.000\nto wear the eye Harmon to the Emmys on a stage.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:34.000\nBut I felt like it would be distracting.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:36.000\nI had a bit to do.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:38.000\nI'm just not like I'm going to be meeting it up there.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\nI had to, I know I set up here.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:41.000\nYou can't pick and choose.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:42.000\nYou got to wear the eye Harmon.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:43.000\nYou got to make it work.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:45.000\nDid you miss it while it was away?\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nYeah, for a couple of times I was like,\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:50.000\nI don't know what's going on with this, but there was a teleprompter.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:59.000\nAnyways, congratulations to everyone that won a creative arts Emmy.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:03.000\nThey're still gold.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nThe real Emmys are next week.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:08.000\nJeff, did you know that Feral Audio is a network?\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:09.000\nIt's a whole network.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:10.000\nThe what?\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:11.000\nYeah.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:14.000\nHarmontown is just one of many Feral Audio programs.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:18.000\nWhat's under the mistake and assumption that we were the only podcast there is?\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:19.000\nNo, no.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:20.000\nI mean, we could be if we wanted to.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:23.000\nWe chose, like Han Solo choosing to be part of the rebellion,\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:29.000\nwe chose to be part of the alliance in hopes of taking down whatever the Death Star is,\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nI assume lack of listenership.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:35.000\nWhat's in it for you and me?\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:38.000\nHan Solo, I believe, was paid for his services.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:39.000\nWell, see, that's the thing.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:40.000\nSee, that's where you're getting wrong.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:45.000\nHan Solo was, that was him still being regular Han Solo.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:46.000\nRight.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:50.000\nThe celebrated pussy Han Solo from the end of Star Wars is the one who's going,\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:51.000\nokay, I got my money.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nActually, that's not true, is it?\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:54.000\nNo.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:55.000\nHe got his bounty.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.000\nHe got his money at the top of Empire.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.000\nThese guys don't even know.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:02.000\nThey're like, which one had the squeab squab in it?\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:04.000\nAnd I don't even know who you're talking about.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:05.000\nWho's squeab squab?\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:09.000\nWhich race did he malign?\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:13.000\nWhich weirdly racist CG character are you talking about, squeab squab?\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:14.000\nI don't know.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:17.000\nIn my day, there was flesh and blood on camera.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:25.000\nDan Harmon, jib jab, squeab squab.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:31.000\nClick here to hear the real audio from the jibbing and jabbing.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:38.000\nOne of our newest brethren at the Feral Audio Network, I looked at it.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nHe's a partner of our friend.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:41.000\nDo you know James Adomian?\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:42.000\nDid you know that guy?\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nHe's from Channel 101 alone.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nHe's out in their appropriate.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nHe's a very, very, very super talented, funny guy.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:54.000\nHe does incredible impressions.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:58.000\nYou probably haven't seen this, but there's that show.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:04.000\nMarc Marons took WTF, his sort of Ilan from that.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nAnd he's doing this IFC show, Marin.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nAnd then they did this thing on the web called Marin in Space,\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nwhere James Adomian is playing Marc Maron.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nAnd it's really fucking funny.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:17.000\nIt's an impression of Marc Maron.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nIt's really, really fun to watch.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nIt's just Marc Maron flying around in space.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:26.000\nAnyways, his partner who produced that with him probably wrote it.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:27.000\nI don't know, we'll ask him for the details.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:30.000\nBut he has a podcast on the Feral Audio Network.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:31.000\nIt's called Don't Ever Change.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nAnd we're going to bring him up right now and talk about it.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nHis name is John Roy.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nHello, John.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:44.000\nGrab any mic you want.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:50.000\nSorry, my intros take a while, but my interviews are even worse.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:51.000\nAwesome.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:52.000\nI'm in.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nI'm a bad interviewer.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:57.000\nBut I'm interested about your podcast because the cult don't ever change.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:00.000\nAnd I haven't listened to it yet, but specifically you have guests on\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nand you talk about the person that they were in high school.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\nThat's it.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:04.000\nJust all about high school.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nSo we've had, we've had Jonah Ray on.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nWe had Matt Myra, Sean Patton.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nWe've got Howard Cramer coming up.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:11.000\nWe just did Ron Funches.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:13.000\nThere's a lot of comedians just talking about what they were like in high school,\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:16.000\nwhat their town was like, what kind of the feel of that.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nAnd then any weird stories like Jonah Ray got in a fight with a Samoan guy.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:22.000\nThe Samoan guy ended up falling down the stairs without Jonah doing anything.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nAnd then they expelled Jonah from high school.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nLike it's like weird stories like that because the dude was on the football team.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:30.000\nSo Jonah had to leave the school because he fell down the stairs essentially.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nSo it's like weird stories like that.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:35.000\nAnd it would have upset the balance for him to stay because it would have,\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:39.000\nJonah Ray would have, would be the guy that beat up a Samoan guy.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nPeople would be gunning for it, man.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:42.000\nLike he'd have to defend it.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:43.000\nI don't even know.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:46.000\nI think you go straight to the top of you, knock a Samoan down the stairs.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:47.000\nI don't want to.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:48.000\nThat's, yeah.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nThen you just, Mr. Saman, then Tyson and you're done.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:51.000\nI think like I did pretty.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:54.000\nIn terms of high school politics, I think you're finished.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:57.000\nYou're Walter White season five.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nI took the Samoan out.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:00.000\nTread lightly.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:03.000\nAt my high school, at my high school, there was a girl and she was this,\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:08.000\nshe was big and she was in the Crips and she beat up three guys from another gang.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:09.000\nShe was Samoan.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:12.000\nEvery detail that story gets better and better.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:13.000\nLike a ladder.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:16.000\nShe was as big as a house and she was very sweet.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:19.000\nShe got, there was a fight broke out and she beat up three guys.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nOne on three, full, all three.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:25.000\nAnd I won't say her name, but she, in front of an AMPM gas station,\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.000\nshe just boxed down three other dudes and like handily.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nWell, there's not going to be four women who all did that.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nWhich one of us is he talking about?\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:33.000\nLike he won't say the name.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:34.000\nSo I guess.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.000\nWell, I mean, yeah.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:36.000\nPeople that went to my high school.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:37.000\nThey know who she is.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:38.000\nThey know who she is.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:42.000\nAnd I wish her well.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:45.000\nIf you're listening and you're Samoan and you've,\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:48.000\nand you're not a badass, like feel free to write into the show and go like,\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nthis is offensive stereotype.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:53.000\nI mean, as sooner or later, we'll get around to that, right?\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:56.000\nLike we're, we're making good headway into our Roddenberry vision of tomorrow.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:59.000\nWhere pretty soon it'll be not okay to say Samoans or badasses,\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nbut as of press time,\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:04.000\nI'm sad to say I don't meet enough Samoans in my life anymore.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:05.000\nI think that's part of it.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:06.000\nIt's an obscure group.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nBut whenever you hear the word Samoan,\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nit's in reference to somebody beating the shit.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nLike that's not beating the shit out of it.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:13.000\nLike it's usually in profession.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nLike there's a Samoan boxer, a Samoan wrestler,\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:19.000\na Samoan or a Samoan kid from your high school that was like a quarterback or something.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:22.000\nLike they, they, they, they color between the lines,\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:26.000\nbut they're, they're, they're, they're unstoppable.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nThey're juggernaut people.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nAgain, if that's,\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:34.000\nit's almost like in a role-playing game when certain races get certain bonuses,\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nlike you have a plus for two strength if you're a dwarf,\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:39.000\nlike if we were really had that for human groups,\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:40.000\nmaybe Samoans get like extra strength.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nLet's, let's, let's clean that up.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:43.000\nI'm assuming it can't be true.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:46.000\nI'm sure I'm assuming that's, that's perfectly racist and like,\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:49.000\nlike tweet me or tumble me or whatever you want to say.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:53.000\nI am a, I am a very, very mild, like, like, like,\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:57.000\nbut, but that's the other thing though is it's like, like, like,\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:01.000\nthey're, they're, I feel like good naturedness is also thrown in there.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nLike it's like, happy people who could beat you up and aren't.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nThey're going to hang out and have fun.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:06.000\nThat's part of it.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nIt's not like, it's not like they eat a lot of them.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nTheir diet is basically root vegetables.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:11.000\nYeah.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:15.000\nBut if you're, if you're a, if you're a scrawny, clumsy,\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:20.000\nmean, like, like, like, like, like, like short tempered,\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:24.000\nineffective bully who always gets his ass kicked and you're Samoan,\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.000\nwe'd love to hear from you.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nSo we can get, just end this.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:31.000\nIf you're a Samoan, you've ever been the head in the arms length bully,\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:35.000\nclassic bully thing and you're unable to punch that guy and you flail away\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nin the air, then yeah, that's cool.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nThat will help us know that people are just people.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:43.000\nI can't believe it took us 72 or so Harmontowns to get to Samoans.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:46.000\nIt's not, it's, it's not like I'm operating with a scalpel.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:49.000\nI'm sort of just keep banging a shovel on the wall.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nI wish black people liked me.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:52.000\nThat's the way to do it.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nI think that's how you get them to like you.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nI'm very forgetful and I tend to repeat myself.\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:00.000\nAnd I, anyways, so John Roy, how long have you been doing this podcast\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nwith people talk about themselves in high school?\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nWe've taped about, or taped Jesus Christ.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:08.000\nNo tape was ever used ever in any podcast, but I'm 39.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nSo I still say tapes for everything.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:14.000\nWe've been doing it about, we've done about 10 episodes, but we've put out about six of them.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nSo really recently we just started it.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nWe started it all in the new studio.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:22.000\nSo we recorded every one up there in Burbank and it's been great.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nThat's my studio.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nOh, well, well, thank you.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:29.000\nIt's pretty good, man.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nI just hope people are, people love it.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nThey, you can tell when they walk in like, oh, there's no visible moth balls.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:34.000\nThis is good.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:38.000\nLike a lot of times you report, you record podcasts in like under a Murphy bed.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:39.000\nLike it can be bad.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:40.000\nLike you don't really know.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nSo they like it.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:47.000\nYeah, I'm trying to become like the Howard Hughes of zero profit industry.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nThis is my first move.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:53.000\nJust skip directly to the urine and jars without the money part in the middle, I think.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:54.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:57.000\nI was urinating in jars when I was 16.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nI think that's why I got fixated on Howard Hughes.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:00.000\nI'm like, you can make money doing this?\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:01.000\nThe answer is no.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nNo, but I'll figure it out.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:04.000\nOh, fuck, fuck.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:05.000\nGod damn it.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:09.000\nBut so you've recorded 10 of them, you've done 10 of these interviews.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:12.000\nLike I'm curious if they're like, are there patterns emerging?\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:13.000\nYeah.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:18.000\nYou know, there's kind of a, you know, a lot of the people I would say over now we've,\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:23.000\nwe've probably, most of the people were really fairly unpopular in high school that became comedians.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nBut then every now and then you'll get one anomaly.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:29.000\nLike Jay Larson was like the biggest stud of his entire school.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:30.000\nAnd he's also super funny.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:35.000\nSo, but I'd say about for most, for the most part you get a fairly unpopular guy who learned\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:39.000\nthat all that shit didn't matter when he discovered either music or comedy or something.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:43.000\nAnd then by about like 25 or so, he's pretty cool.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:44.000\nAnd now he's a comedian.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nDo you think, which chicken lays which egg there?\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nOr which egg lays which chicken is it?\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:54.000\nAre people that are destined to play guitar or paint something well or make people laugh?\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:57.000\nAre they like, are their brain shaped differently?\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:00.000\nTherefore, they're not as facile at school politics.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:04.000\nOr is it just like, hey, somebody's got to be the dork and it's you.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:07.000\nTherefore, you're going to end up drawing apples better.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nProbably not the latter.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:14.000\nI feel like, like there's certain personality traits and skills you have to have to be funny.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:18.000\nAnd you can get the impetus to drive you to get those skills in different ways.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nIf you are unpopular, it's like a defense mechanism.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:23.000\nLike I can't beat these guys up, but I can make fun of the teacher.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:24.000\nThey'll all laugh at that.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:27.000\nThink I have some kind of anti-fear powers.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:30.000\nAnd then they're like, oh, maybe he's got something to him.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:33.000\nOr you could be super popular at school, but you got to ship all home life.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:38.000\nAnd the only way to make your dad fucking pay attention is you learn how to get this funny thing going.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:42.000\nSo I think there's a lot of ways that will teach a guy who has the aptitude for it\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:46.000\nthat maybe you should try, if he said something right now, maybe everybody will laugh.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:49.000\nIs the same go for male and female comics?\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:52.000\nWe are just about to have our first female guest coming up.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nWe're going to have Emily Gordon on.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:59.000\nSo that'll be the first opportunity to be like, hey, are we learning universal things?\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:04.000\nOr are we learning just boys' clubs, crybaby in the room with quadrophenian earphones going,\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:05.000\nwhy don't you wake me?\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:09.000\nIs that just a male thing or is that an everybody thing?\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:10.000\nI don't know.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:11.000\nThat's always something I've wondered.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:16.000\nI felt like this question has been very delicately trod on territory.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:20.000\nIt's like female comics versus male comics and stuff.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:24.000\nI just felt like, for me, the male class clowns were rewarded for it.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:28.000\nThe female class clowns were punished for it.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nThe teachers shut them off.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:31.000\nThe reinforcement was different.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:32.000\nOr the other classmates did.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:38.000\nIt was not as okay for a gal in my junior high and high school to kind of wisecrack for some reason.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nLike, I don't know where it came from.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nIf it was everybody or from the top down.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:47.000\nI'm going to ask that very question and we'll find out the answer to that.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:50.000\nShe'll be able to really bring...\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:57.000\nYou'll make up for Ten Dude's interviews with her because she's also trained in the whole thinking about all that stuff as well.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:58.000\nRight.\n\n14:58.000 --> 14:59.000\nWe want anyone thinking about anything.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:02.000\nA lot of times our podcast is like, what is you eating Burger King?\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:03.000\nOh, fucking all that shit.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.000\nChicken sandwich?\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:05.000\nOh yeah, chicken sandwich.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:10.000\nWe need to get a little bit more intellectual discourse on things.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.000\nThat's kind of like Harvard Town.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nIt's a little like Harvard Town.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:17.000\nGirls are definitely socialized to like...\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:18.000\nSocialize.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:19.000\nRight?\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:24.000\nLike guys are told, at least maybe this is a generational thing and we're changing it now,\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:29.000\nbut it's always been the thing of like guys are told, don't change your mind about anything.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:30.000\nThat's a form of weakness.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:34.000\nSo you have these weird arguments with guys about like, I thought you said you hated the Matrix.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:35.000\nWhat's up, fucker?\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:39.000\nAnd it's like guys have emotional reactions to that stuff.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:43.000\nI go like, no, I said, but I said I didn't like any Keanu Reeves movie.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:44.000\nHe did a good job with the Matrix.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nI'll give him that.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nI'll give him that.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:50.000\nYou can be the biggest nerd in the world, but you're having this like male socialized\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:51.000\nexperience.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:54.000\nBut even though no one's starting any punches and no one could, if it ever came to that.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:55.000\nAnd the stakes get me lower.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:56.000\nThat's your opinion of the Matrix.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:57.000\nYou can change it.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:58.000\nYeah.\n\n15:58.000 --> 15:59.000\nYou can change it.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:00.000\nI used to like the Matrix.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:01.000\nNow I don't.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:02.000\nGood.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:03.000\nFine.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:04.000\nAre we getting food?\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:05.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:06.000\nI don't care.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:12.820\nSo, I suggest if you believe in your shooting while you're voting on progone asylum attacks,\n\n16:12.820 --> 16:14.280\nthat's how you cover your life.\n\n16:14.280 --> 16:17.220\nIt doesn't matter how bad your life is.\n\n16:17.220 --> 16:22.000\nYou can turn something up where you're gonna be already.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:23.600\nChallenge, religion, love.\n\n16:23.600 --> 16:26.000\nAnd you don't end up with the Matrix.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nIt's still time.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:33.000\nIn that case, you gotta run out of time.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:34.000\nFrugal.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:35.000\nIs this the first time you've seen this funny?\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:40.600\nright. Well, I think that's why you, I think you make yourself right. Yeah, you pick, you'll go like\n\n16:40.600 --> 16:44.440\nketchup's the worst and I'll tell you why. And then you just, you just plant a flag and then\n\n16:44.440 --> 16:50.360\nyou're not gonna, you're not gonna stop until mustard is illegal. And it's like, you just, you just do\n\n16:50.360 --> 16:58.760\nit to do it. I do it because, I mean, I pick, I think in the past I would pick things like you say\n\n16:58.760 --> 17:03.800\nand then I would stick to them for no reason. I did do what you said is that, like sometimes I would\n\n17:03.800 --> 17:09.160\njust pick the diametrically opposed thing just to have that sort of interaction. Just get that\n\n17:09.160 --> 17:13.240\nthing going, whatever that is. I think I definitely outgrew that, but like I'll just go like, you\n\n17:13.240 --> 17:17.480\nknow what, like fuck Wolf Blitzer, fuck Led Zeppelin, fuck this, fuck that. Well, the second\n\n17:17.480 --> 17:24.200\none's controversial. Who's gonna go, wait a minute, fuck Wolf Blitzer? Did you just say something\n\n17:24.200 --> 17:31.800\nabout News Candy Rogers? The camera pans over and there's like a Paul Bunyan guy who's just\n\n17:31.800 --> 17:39.080\nwiping his mouth with a napkin. I can tolerate a lot of things. I've watched my country go from\n\n17:39.080 --> 17:45.000\na field of beautiful pine to a bunch of Walmart parking lots, but I won't have anybody selling\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:52.280\na Wolf Blitzer's name. You sir can meet me outside. But like, you know, I, I, I, my joke was always\n\n17:52.280 --> 17:57.640\nthat I can convince anybody that they don't actually like Rush because they don't, because\n\n17:57.640 --> 18:01.560\nyou're right. They don't like them. No, you had, you had an older brother who did and you're, you're an\n\n18:01.560 --> 18:07.800\nidiot. And don't say they're technically a good man because Hitler was technically a good chancellor\n\n18:07.800 --> 18:12.760\nand shit. That's what I think Rush did and what bothers people that hate them. And I know people\n\n18:12.760 --> 18:18.120\nlike them. They took rock and roll and then they drained all of the sex out, just all of it, just\n\n18:18.120 --> 18:24.680\npulled all every amount of sex. And then they replaced it with Anne Rand and sci-fi, which is not\n\n18:24.680 --> 18:29.480\na good substitute. Rock and roll with sex. It was Elvis, it was Elvis and all that shit. And I was\n\n18:29.480 --> 18:35.480\nlike, no, we'll take all of the reason this music exists. We'll move that. It's about the fountain\n\n18:35.480 --> 18:42.360\nhead with bass pedals and octagon trumps. Because Rush, Rush was like 70s, 80s, right? Like, yeah,\n\n18:42.360 --> 18:48.120\nyeah, it's a lot of sexy music. A lot of people were inseminated and conceived during-\n\n18:48.120 --> 18:54.760\nby touring the snow dogs. Nobody was conceived to a Rush song. Nobody put on red Marchetta and\n\n18:54.760 --> 19:02.200\ntook his pants off. Nobody's father came drink, ah, salesman. Salesman!\n\n19:07.320 --> 19:09.960\nIn fact, in fact, my sperm count just got lower with sales.\n\n19:09.960 --> 19:17.480\nLook, what, look, though his mind is not for red, to any God or government. It's reserved\n\n19:17.480 --> 19:23.160\na quiet defense, lighting out the day's mess. Fucking Rush can go fucking.\n\n19:23.160 --> 19:26.440\nIf you choose to not decide, you still have made a choice.\n\n19:26.440 --> 19:30.200\nNo, no, you haven't. You haven't at all. Honey, not tonight. I have a headache again.\n\n19:32.520 --> 19:38.520\nI think I have a technically, I have a technical headache. Joe Hill, the author, totally hates Rush\n\n19:38.520 --> 19:42.840\nand he was tweeting some shit and somebody tweeted something about how he was just so mad\n\n19:42.840 --> 19:47.000\nthat Rush was in the hall. So Joe Hill goes, in honor of Rush getting in the Rockin' Hall of\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:51.320\nFame, I will now listen to all my favorite Rush records. And then a minute later, he goes, done!\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:58.360\nI mean, I, yeah, when I played Dungeons & Dragons in high school, my first Dungeon Master,\n\n19:58.360 --> 20:04.360\nno, not my first, my best Dungeon Master, Graham, had the jean jackets and he had the,\n\n20:04.360 --> 20:09.480\nall his t-shirts were like from different states that had state parks because he loved,\n\n20:09.480 --> 20:14.040\nhe loved nature. He wanted to be an elf or like Spock. Like he was one of those personalities.\n\n20:14.040 --> 20:20.200\nHe, he barefoot alighted himself on his, on his pit stains, like, like, and went to high school\n\n20:20.200 --> 20:24.760\nwith a woman's briefcase and, and because he was like, I give zero fucks. Like, I guess you didn't know,\n\n20:24.760 --> 20:28.200\nokay, because, because he was like, he's like Spock, but like badass.\n\n20:28.200 --> 20:33.000\nHe gave and received zero fucks. Yeah, it's like, fuck you, I'm smarter than you. Like,\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:38.040\nyou know how you want, you want like the Columbine kid to, you want to reach back in time and go,\n\n20:38.040 --> 20:42.280\nit doesn't matter. Like, Graham was one of the kids that, he knew it didn't matter. Okay.\n\n20:42.280 --> 20:45.080\nThat's the personality you get. He's just like, fuck this, fuck this, fuck all of it.\n\n20:45.080 --> 20:50.360\nHe saw you losing the minute they presented it to him. But he loved Rush, yeah. He loved\n\n20:50.360 --> 20:55.080\nDenim and Rush and, and, and, and, and yeah, they were like, you know, he'd sign your yearbook with\n\n20:55.080 --> 21:01.080\nRush lyrics and, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't hate him. I, he made me, he, he, he, he, because he\n\n21:01.080 --> 21:04.760\nloved him so much, I would, I would be like, I would be one of those diametrical guys and go,\n\n21:04.760 --> 21:11.560\nlike, they're the worst. Pink Floyd's way better. Like, right. Is it yes, is it yes, the band that\n\n21:11.560 --> 21:19.400\nhas like a, they're all good people. They may absolutely fuck off into the night forever.\n\n21:21.880 --> 21:25.960\nI'm sorry. I have a special guest, you know, I hate to, we're talking about music, but you\n\n21:25.960 --> 21:31.080\nknow, I really, it's Neil Pert right behind me right now. You don't have to deal with the professor.\n\n21:31.080 --> 21:36.600\nOne of, one of my favorite musicians of the world from the Michael Jackson Thriller song is\n\n21:36.600 --> 21:42.200\nVincent Price. Did you, I don't know if you knew that, like, is he here tonight? Well, he's, yeah,\n\n21:42.200 --> 21:48.440\na lot of people think he's dead, but Vincent Price is actually here. Is it Vincent Price, the actor,\n\n21:48.440 --> 21:54.680\nor Vincent Price from, from Thriller? It's, it's Vincent Price, it's Vincent Price, the actor.\n\n21:54.680 --> 21:58.520\nI don't know if he wants to do the, the Thriller bridge. Should I get, should I do a beat? Maybe\n\n21:58.520 --> 22:02.280\nyou could rap a bit and he could do like the, the Vincent Price breakdown in the middle of it?\n\n22:03.640 --> 22:10.600\nI mean, we could. It's been so very long. It's James Adomian, everybody.\n\n22:13.160 --> 22:16.920\nThat's one of my favorite impressions that he does is this Vincent Price. He did it in a,\n\n22:16.920 --> 22:25.640\nin a Yacht Rock episode. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. I'm rapping bout, rapping with my friend Vincent\n\n22:25.640 --> 22:31.320\nPrice. Gonna do the rap, then he's gonna do the bridge. Nice. First I'm gonna talk about my favorite\n\n22:31.320 --> 22:48.280\ncereal. Yo, I like to pour it into a bowl and eat it down. Drain the milk, slowly. He just made\n\n22:48.280 --> 22:57.240\ncereal spooky. I don't know what else to do there. Mount Chocula brand cereal.\n\n22:57.240 --> 23:03.960\nYeah, just, all right. Well, anyways, I don't know. I don't want to pimp you to do impressions\n\n23:03.960 --> 23:07.560\nand stuff, but. Oh, I love that. I love when he, when, I, when I was a kid, he used to do\n\n23:07.560 --> 23:12.760\nadvertisements, like you would. Cousin subs, for instance? I don't know that one. What is it,\n\n23:12.760 --> 23:16.600\nhow does it go? Well, I was, I was a local sub place hat. You've had Vincent Price on the, on\n\n23:16.600 --> 23:22.680\nthe payroll and he would go, hello, sorry to interrupt your meal, but you could be having\n\n23:22.680 --> 23:30.200\na spooky sandwich. I was just about, I was, and he would pull a cord and a cheap ass photo shop\n\n23:30.200 --> 23:36.520\npendulum would cut the sandwich in half. That's how I cut my sandwiches. Ham has been murdered.\n\n23:37.320 --> 23:42.600\nWas that voice ever actually considered scary by society? Like, why that voice? It's weird.\n\n23:42.600 --> 23:47.000\nIt dates back to really asshole landlords from the 1800s. That's why they're afraid\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:51.640\nthey could cut off their gas oil at any moment. So that voice is terrifying. People really used\n\n23:51.640 --> 23:56.200\nto believe in vampires. I think it's, so you didn't have to be like ripped in order to be scary.\n\n23:56.840 --> 24:01.320\nWe transitioned into a society where like we had enough security camera footage\n\n24:02.120 --> 24:06.600\nto realize that the really scary thing is physical fitness and, you know,\n\n24:09.400 --> 24:15.560\nsociopathic was no longer sociopathology, not people who are, I'm a gentleman. I like the\n\n24:15.560 --> 24:21.640\nsmell of your blood. It's like, like that guy you can take down. Aesthetic reasons are the reasons\n\n24:21.640 --> 24:27.800\nI persecut you. I was like, there used to be a fear of people like Bella Legosi. Like that guy's\n\n24:27.800 --> 24:32.680\nnot scary really through a modern lens. Yeah, look at that weak link. He's out to get us.\n\n24:33.720 --> 24:38.200\nNot after you see enough like Chinese babies getting run over in parking lots. Like I got\n\n24:38.200 --> 24:43.560\nfour a chance. Hey, I didn't put them there. Jesus, why do I always bear the brunt for these\n\n24:43.560 --> 24:48.840\nvideos I mentioned? Wait, tell me more about the Chinese baby parking lot.\n\n24:49.960 --> 24:55.320\nDude, if you know what to look for and I do, no, there's horrible things that happen.\n\n24:55.880 --> 24:59.480\nIf I type those keywords in, I'm looking at a video of babies being run over in a parking\n\n24:59.480 --> 25:05.560\nlot. There are so many cameras now and there's been that way for so long and the population\n\n25:05.560 --> 25:12.200\nis so high now and there are so many countries where, like China has different rules, by the way.\n\n25:12.200 --> 25:17.320\nI guess I'm rift. Oh, you're saying this surveillance footage of a baby accidentally\n\n25:17.320 --> 25:22.040\nbeing run over. There's not a parking lot full of babies that people as a blood sport like.\n\n25:22.040 --> 25:25.880\nWell, that might be a thing. I don't know. One child policy wasn't working.\n\n25:27.320 --> 25:32.120\nThere's just horrible shit you can see. Like in countries that are overpopulated and that don't\n\n25:32.120 --> 25:36.440\nhave good Samaritan laws, you know, where there's like, there's just like, oh, this guy was eating\n\n25:36.440 --> 25:47.400\nsomeone on a subway. Look at this. Anyways. Eating on a subway? Where? What would Vincent\n\n25:47.400 --> 25:52.440\nPrice have to say about a Chinese baby getting run over? Oh, God. Nothing appropriate.\n\n25:58.920 --> 26:00.040\nMy one son.\n\n26:00.040 --> 26:08.280\nMy one precious son. Come unto the carbuncle.\n\n26:11.800 --> 26:14.600\nCome unto the carbuncle. That was a big post story, I think.\n\n26:15.640 --> 26:17.800\nCome unto the carbuncle. Wasn't that egg round? Oh, I think.\n\n26:17.800 --> 26:21.960\nAll right, let's make it easier. Wait, keep the music on, Jeff. Hey, Vincent Price, maybe we\n\n26:21.960 --> 26:29.320\nshould go. Vincent Price, I know you're my roommate. I was hoping that we could pay the bill\n\n26:29.320 --> 26:38.360\nto the Department of Water and Power. My card isn't work. Could we go to the grocery store together?\n\n26:43.240 --> 26:49.720\nI just, we need to get some Sudofan and some maple syrup. Do you mean some pseudo-athedron\n\n26:49.720 --> 26:56.120\nfor your ills? Oh, my God. I have quite the elixir roommate of all mine. Oh, my God. It's\n\n26:56.120 --> 27:02.840\nmaking me drowsy. I don't know. Okay. I hope that's the first episode of a long series of\n\n27:02.840 --> 27:12.440\nVincent Price's My Roommates. Can you do, can you do, can you do Marin on Q? Or is that?\n\n27:13.480 --> 27:16.040\nLet me do an interview with Marc Maron real quick. Yeah, what do you want? Yes.\n\n27:17.960 --> 27:23.240\nSo I just, come on. What, really? Thanks for having me on your show, Marc Maron.\n\n27:23.240 --> 27:28.200\nOh, yo, yeah. It's my show because I thought I was being interviewed. Yeah, fine. So you did\n\n27:28.200 --> 27:35.640\nthis show. What was that like? That's awesome. Yeah, you got to say Marin in space is fucking\n\n27:35.640 --> 27:42.520\namazing. Thank you. It's really, really, really funny. They're web shorts. You spend the whole\n\n27:42.520 --> 27:49.400\ntime laughing. I was talking to you about this. This will sound pretentious to non-LA people who\n\n27:49.400 --> 27:53.080\ndon't make stuff for a living and all this stuff. It's like we're up here jerking each other off\n\n27:53.080 --> 28:01.240\nbut let's jerk each other off for a second. Your impressions, I think, because sometimes people\n\n28:01.240 --> 28:04.520\nfeel about impressions the way they feel about magic. It's like, well, what are you really,\n\n28:04.520 --> 28:08.440\nwhat are you doing? You're just, you're sounding like somebody, but I think there's a, you do them\n\n28:08.440 --> 28:14.520\nin a strange, tender way, like you write up to your, when you're doing Marc Maron. Massage the\n\n28:14.520 --> 28:18.280\nmuscles of the person you're impersonating. Like you're not, you're not sitting there watching\n\n28:18.280 --> 28:23.320\nMarc Maron and going, ah, fuck him. Here's how he talks, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh. Like you're,\n\n28:23.320 --> 28:27.080\nlike you create a character for him. That was rich little process.\n\n28:30.200 --> 28:33.240\nI feel sometimes when I'm listening to an impression being done, I feel like, okay,\n\n28:33.240 --> 28:37.320\ncongratulations. You figured out that, you know, Nick Nolte has an overbite, like, like,\n\n28:37.320 --> 28:42.680\nbut that's, like, but you, I feel like your, your characters are a little more loving. Yeah, well,\n\n28:42.680 --> 28:48.520\nI like, sometimes I hate them. Like George B. Bush, I was trying to ruin him, but yeah, usually\n\n28:48.520 --> 28:53.800\nit's like something I'm fascinated by for good reasons. And then it's just fun to sort of imagine\n\n28:53.800 --> 28:57.320\nplaying being that person. When you're, when you're, when you're in your head, you're like,\n\n28:57.320 --> 29:00.760\nyou got a little simulator running, like you are the person, right? A little bit because you have\n\n29:00.760 --> 29:05.160\nto know what they might say. Yeah. Yeah. That's what helps with somebody like Jesse Ventura,\n\n29:05.160 --> 29:10.120\nbecause he can, he lives in so many worlds is that he, he, no matter what happens, there's either a\n\n29:10.120 --> 29:16.840\nconspiracy or an old match that's scarred him. So if I were to, if Jesse Ventura were my roommate\n\n29:16.840 --> 29:24.680\nand I needed him to. This is a real crowded apartment. I know, but you, you, you, you, we\n\n29:24.680 --> 29:28.280\ntoured it together when we decided to sign the lease and I, you haven't paid the, you're part of the\n\n29:28.280 --> 29:33.080\nelectric bill yet. You mean to the department of water and power? I want to know how high it goes.\n\n29:33.080 --> 29:41.320\nIt just goes to the office. You just write your, your half is 1750. My half is 1750. And then we\n\n29:41.320 --> 29:49.400\ndon't, why are there only two parties? It's just two halves of the check, man. It's like, like,\n\n29:49.400 --> 29:55.240\ndid you go to work this week or? Yep. I was, I was commenting on some underground DVD titles.\n\n29:58.280 --> 30:02.440\nYou seem defensive when you say that. How much does that pull down a year? I work. I was surfing.\n\n30:02.440 --> 30:09.960\nYou don't need to know my business. All right, Jesse Ventura. He's an, he's an impressionist.\n\n30:12.600 --> 30:16.600\nI don't, I don't get to like a lot of impressionists. It's fun for me. Yeah, no, it is. Yeah, it's,\n\n30:16.600 --> 30:20.200\nthere's a rarefied number that it's refreshing. You know what? I'm putting out the magician\n\n30:20.200 --> 30:24.040\nchallenge. If you're a magician and you think that Jeff and I can like you come, come to harm it down.\n\n30:25.560 --> 30:30.600\nDo a little magic. Yeah. It'll be great for the listening. For me, like, when you think of\n\n30:30.600 --> 30:33.560\nimpressionists, like, I have friends that, I have a couple of friends that can do impressions of\n\n30:33.560 --> 30:37.160\nalmost anybody and it's great. But the reason why it's fun is because they're funny. The things\n\n30:37.160 --> 30:41.560\nthey say are actually like, you're, you're being funny while saying them. Rich little for my money\n\n30:41.560 --> 30:51.720\nisn't a very funny guy. Ooh. He's taken on Wolf Blitzer and Rich little Jeff Davis bashes Rich\n\n30:51.720 --> 31:03.160\nlittle. Take that. Who's next? Frank Gorshin. Remember him? Like, he was actually funny. Like,\n\n31:03.160 --> 31:07.240\nwhen he did Bert Lancaster, it was a fucking riot because he said funny things. Like, so that's,\n\n31:07.240 --> 31:10.840\nthat's the difference. Like, I wish I could, I can't do an, I can do like two impressions\n\n31:10.840 --> 31:14.840\nand no shitty. Like, what would piss me off is I would go on the road as a comic with these guys\n\n31:14.840 --> 31:18.840\nwho would do impressions of people who are already funny. They were comedians like Rodney\n\n31:18.840 --> 31:24.680\nDangerfield and then they would just do Rodney bits under the guys. I do that. I do that sometimes.\n\n31:26.280 --> 31:31.080\nNo, I make up a new one. No, you make up a new one. These guys were doing actual Rodney bits.\n\n31:31.080 --> 31:38.440\nJames, how much respect do you think that you get? You know, I get a little bit of respect.\n\n31:39.960 --> 31:44.040\nThat's the worst Rodney Dangerfield I've ever heard in my life. You said James.\n\n31:44.040 --> 31:48.440\nDo you have to do it like Lipton? Is Rodney there?\n\n31:50.440 --> 31:52.600\nI'm always waiting for the James Lipton moment.\n\n31:54.200 --> 31:55.880\nIs Rodney inside you right now?\n\n31:57.880 --> 32:03.640\nI get, I can do, I can do some impressions. You can do a Liam? You thought you had Liam\n\n32:03.640 --> 32:07.720\nNeeson that we found out that you lost it? I thought I had him for a while. Can we try some Liam?\n\n32:07.720 --> 32:12.520\nWell, ask me a question about wolves.\n\n32:16.840 --> 32:22.520\nThe wolves, are they nearby? It doesn't matter if they're nearby. They'll bite you.\n\n32:25.560 --> 32:27.640\nDid Liam Neeson? You know what? I walked into that.\n\n32:28.600 --> 32:32.200\nIt's intimidating looking at him and doing it. Was Liam Neeson eating a sandwich during that one?\n\n32:32.200 --> 32:37.240\nThere is no sandwich. There's just wolf bites.\n\n32:39.240 --> 32:44.520\nYeah, I'm sorry. I pimped you for that. Who can you most confidently do? Who's your best impression?\n\n32:44.520 --> 32:49.240\nNo, I don't think I have someone that I'm like, oh, slam dunk.\n\n32:49.240 --> 32:52.840\nYou don't? You used to do a pretty good Rosie Perez.\n\n32:54.680 --> 32:59.480\nMaybe Mr. T. I think I could pity the fool and put something on my head,\n\n32:59.480 --> 33:05.240\nbut that's more of a prop work kind of thing. Can we want to do a Jesse Ventura?\n\n33:08.280 --> 33:11.400\nJust turn your voice over like you've been shouting all day.\n\n33:16.280 --> 33:22.120\nYou listen to me, rowdy rowdy piper. That's pretty good. It's like a different wrestler.\n\n33:22.120 --> 33:29.240\nNow, dad, do the gray, but instead of Liam Neeson put Jesse Ventura in there as the star of the gray.\n\n33:29.240 --> 33:35.480\nIt doesn't matter how far along we are if they have copes we're already dead.\n\n33:36.760 --> 33:42.760\nI sound like Nick Nolte. Rich. This is Gary Busey.\n\n33:46.120 --> 33:47.400\nThis is also Gary Busey.\n\n33:47.400 --> 33:52.360\nThis is either Popeye or Marlon Brando.\n\n33:54.200 --> 33:54.920\nOr neither.\n\n33:58.600 --> 33:59.800\nDon't take that off the table.\n\n34:01.400 --> 34:02.760\nCould be neither. Could be neither.\n\n34:02.760 --> 34:05.160\nDon't remove that option. We're going to use it.\n\n34:05.160 --> 34:05.960\nOr Johnny Carson.\n\n34:09.240 --> 34:12.280\nDo Johnny Carson doing a scene from Streetcar named Desire?\n\n34:12.280 --> 34:19.400\nOh, have you heard about the Napoleonic Clause? Johnny Carson was a nerd back in the old days.\n\n34:19.400 --> 34:23.640\nWe would play a game you'd get high and then you would do what we called plausible Carson episode.\n\n34:23.640 --> 34:27.000\nAnd what it was was you had to introduce three people for a Carson, but it had to\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:31.640\nbeen people who would conceivably be on the same show during the actual run of the Tonight Show.\n\n34:31.640 --> 34:35.400\nSo you'd be like, we have a great show tonight. We have Martin Moll from the hit movie Mr. Mom\n\n34:35.400 --> 34:40.680\nis here. Beautiful young singer Deon Warwick is here tonight. And from Lenny and Squeaky,\n\n34:40.680 --> 34:43.960\nMichael McKean, like it would have to be people that actually could have shared a\n\n34:43.960 --> 34:47.320\nCarson bill and it gets it. And the game is over when the third name is said.\n\n34:47.320 --> 34:50.200\nYeah. When you just can't, when no one can make, can do it anymore.\n\n34:50.200 --> 34:52.840\nLike, and when you're not high enough to still think it's funny.\n\n34:52.840 --> 34:56.600\nI think those are like, those are, that's like when the game runs out.\n\n34:56.600 --> 34:57.960\nI would play that by mail with you.\n\n35:02.760 --> 35:04.760\nDoes anyone play Peaks by Mail anymore?\n\n35:04.760 --> 35:05.240\nI do. I do.\n\n35:05.240 --> 35:06.600\nYou don't really play by mail, do you?\n\n35:06.600 --> 35:10.040\nI play a game by mail with Matt Gurley from Super Ego.\n\n35:10.040 --> 35:13.560\nSuper Ego is my favorite podcast. My friend Matt, who I've been, best friends with from\n\n35:13.560 --> 35:18.600\nlike seventh grade on, we play a game called Death that we started doing in a...\n\n35:18.600 --> 35:19.800\nI think we're all playing that one.\n\n35:21.480 --> 35:23.400\nEspecially the people that are mailing things to each other.\n\n35:24.120 --> 35:25.160\nThey're the ones that are winning.\n\n35:25.880 --> 35:28.520\nI have a real kicker of a chess move.\n\n35:30.280 --> 35:32.680\nMake this stamp go down to the post office.\n\n35:33.960 --> 35:36.280\nBrook Four and the envelope. So excited.\n\n35:36.280 --> 35:37.880\nTwo months later, let's see if it worked.\n\n35:37.880 --> 35:42.200\nWe started in school. One of us would just draw like a guy.\n\n35:42.200 --> 35:43.400\nLike a middle of a piece of paper.\n\n35:43.400 --> 35:45.480\nWe'd just draw a neutral guy standing there.\n\n35:45.480 --> 35:47.640\nAnd then you would draw him dying somehow.\n\n35:47.640 --> 35:51.880\nAnd then you would give it to the person who would slip it, like a note in class.\n\n35:51.880 --> 35:54.520\nAnd originally it was just like back and forth in school.\n\n35:54.520 --> 35:56.840\nAnd by the end of this page, and we have these from school,\n\n35:56.840 --> 35:59.800\nwhere there's just 30 million, like really, they get more and more obscure.\n\n35:59.800 --> 36:00.840\nYou can't repeat it.\n\n36:00.840 --> 36:01.960\nSo then they would get really weird.\n\n36:01.960 --> 36:06.040\nSo now if Matt mails me one, there'll be a guy and there'll just be a fruit cart\n\n36:06.040 --> 36:10.200\nway in the background. That has a sign that says oranges,\n\n36:10.200 --> 36:11.480\nwhich is a Godfather reference.\n\n36:12.200 --> 36:14.920\nBecause every time you see an orange in the Godfather, somebody dies.\n\n36:14.920 --> 36:16.360\nOh, so the fruit cart doesn't have to kill him?\n\n36:16.360 --> 36:20.760\nYeah, it's just, he's going to get whacked because there's oranges in the background.\n\n36:20.760 --> 36:23.480\nRight. It's not a fruit cart accident, per se.\n\n36:23.480 --> 36:24.600\nBut when's the last time you did that?\n\n36:24.600 --> 36:26.040\nYou're not doing that actively.\n\n36:26.040 --> 36:26.680\nIt is active.\n\n36:27.560 --> 36:28.760\nWhose move is it right now?\n\n36:28.760 --> 36:30.680\nIt's Matt's. It's on his refrigerator.\n\n36:30.680 --> 36:32.840\nAnd he's fucking taken a long sweet time about it.\n\n36:32.840 --> 36:33.720\nWhat a fucker.\n\n36:33.720 --> 36:34.680\nI know. Fuck that guy.\n\n36:34.680 --> 36:38.920\nAll right.

Go check it out.\n\n36:56.360 --> 36:57.800\nIt really is funny. I can't recommend it.\n\n36:57.800 --> 36:58.280\nAll right.\n\n36:58.280 --> 37:08.600\nJames and John, thanks for coming by.\n\n37:09.880 --> 37:13.240\nAll right.

me every now, it's really wonderful\n\n01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.960\nyou know what I'm finding\n\n01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.960\nI have a really crazy memory for lyrics\n\n01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:07.960\nI remember songs I learned when I was a little kid\n\n01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.960\nlike, I did a lot of musical theater\n\n01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.960\nI know all the lyrics\n\n01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.960\nthe ABCD song\n\n01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.960\nsame melody\n\n01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.960\nsomebody should get sued\n\n01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:19.960\nbut like\n\n01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.960\ngoing back and listening to songs that you learned\n\n01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.960\nwhen you were a kid and you didn't really\n\n01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.960\nknow what the meaning was about it\n\n01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.960\nall of a sudden there's this little epiphany\n\n01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:29.960\nthat's what it's about\n\n01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.960\nthose moments really hit me right in the old days\n\n01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.960\nI was a little kid and I loved four weddings in a funeral\n\n01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.960\nand it wasn't until the 10th time I watched it\n\n01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.960\nthat I realized that those two characters were gay\n\n01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:39.960\nand that like\n\n01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.960\nchanged my life\n\n01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.960\nI was like, I guess they're not so bad\n\n01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.960\nit's true, like you know\n\n01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.960\ngrew up very homophobic and stuff\n\n01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.960\nbecause very religious and so\n\n01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.960\nbut that was part of the reason watching that movie\n\n01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.960\nI was like, oh okay, people do whatever they want\n\n01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.960\nI was watching West Side Story on TCM\n\n01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.960\nlike a few months ago\n\n01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.960\nand I cried, like openly\n\n01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.960\nalone at my place\n\n01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:03.960\nbut not at one of the sad songs\n\n01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.960\nI want to be in America\n\n01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.960\nyou know why? because it's a fucking good number\n\n01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.960\nit's a fucking good song\n\n01:20:09.960 -->

sexy dude, what's his name?\n\n01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.960\nBernardo\n\n01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.960\nhe fucking rules, he's so good\n\n01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.960\nand the music is great\n\n01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.960\nand what's her name, Cheetah Rivera\n\n01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.960\nit's just so good\n\n01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.960\nit's like a triumphant moment\n\n01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.960\nthere's little things like that\n\n01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.960\nthat really fucking came together\n\n01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.960\nthere's a bunch of, that's 200 people making\n\n01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.960\nsomething happen\n\n01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.960\nthat's another thing that always gets me\n\n01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.960\nis when it's humanity working as one thing\n\n01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.960\nlike I went to a space shuttle launch and it's moving\n\n01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.960\nthere's like six people on that fucking thing\n\n01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.960\nand like it's like\n\n01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.960\nI was just sobbing crying\n\n01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.960\nand there was a guy next to me and he's a colonel\n\n01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.960\nin the Air Force\n\n01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.960\nand he was sobbing crying\n\n01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:57.960\nhe had a friend on board that thing\n\n01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.960\nI thought he was gonna, he turned to you, suck it up pussy\n\n01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.960\nlet's get this bird in the air\n\n01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.960\nwe're not gonna do it with your tears\n\n01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.960\nhe's standing next to me\n\n01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.960\nI knew, we had talked about it before\n\n01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.960\nhe goes, he's got a buddy on board this thing\n\n01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.960\nit was like the last launch of Atlantis I think\n\n01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:13.960\nor second to last, supposed to be the last\n\n01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.960\nbut they added one more I think\n\n01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.960\nand so when it went up, I was just like\n\n01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.960\nmy jaw hit my chest and I was just streaming\n\n01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.960\nnot like, huh huh, crying\n\n01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.960\njust a steady flow of tears\n\n01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.960\nI've never really cried like that\n\n01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.960\nit was just complete awe\n\n01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.960\nit's so easy to think that\n\n01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.960\nbillions of years ago\n\n01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.960\nthere was a sun supernova\n\n01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:35.960\nand one piece of dust or whatever settles\n\n01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.960\nwhere Earth is and it just happens to spin and cool\n\n01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.960\nthe hot gases spin and spin for eons\n\n01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.960\nand then they cool and it sort of forms\n\n01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.960\nso that it just happens to be habitable\n\n01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:45.960\ncut to us like launching shit into space\n\n01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.960\nand next to me is this guy, he looks like the great Santini\n\n01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.960\nhe's a bad ass\n\n01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:51.960\npilot, test pilot\n\n01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.960\ntough guy, ex astronaut\n\n01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.960\nand I know he's got a buddy on board\n\n01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.960\nand he's very sunflower about it\n\n01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.960\nand he was saying like\n\n01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.960\npeople don't really cheer\n\n01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.960\njust so you know, when it launches\n\n01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.960\na lot of people cheer but the people that have been to these before\n\n01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.960\nthey don't cheer until the solid rocket boosters detach\n\n01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.960\nbecause when those are still lit\n\n01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.960\nand they're still attached to it, anything can go wrong\n\n01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.960\nand there's no way to abort it\n\n01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:15.960\nonce they release, there's a possible way things go wrong\n\n01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.960\nto have them return to the land side\n\n01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.960\nthey're going into space against God\n\n01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.960\nand things can go wrong\n\n01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.960\nand they're strapped to a bomb\n\n01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:25.960\nand they can't turn off until those run off\n\n01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.960\nand once the SRB is detached\n\n01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.960\nthen there's a way for them to nose over\n\n01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.960\nand do a return to landing site\n\n01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.960\nwhich has never been done thank God\n\n01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:35.960\ndid you tell him that there's a traditional\n\n01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.960\nthere's things that can go wrong when you're telling people how to cheer\n\n01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.960\nI was asking him a million questions\n\n01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.960\nI wanted to know\n\n01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.960\nthat was unsolicited, I'm sorry\n\n01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.960\nhe was just saying\n\n01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.960\nI said how many of these have you been to\n\n01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:49.960\nthen I find out that he's a pilot\n\n01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:51.960\nand he's got a buddy on board\n\n01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.960\nand he's like\n\n01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:55.960\nwere you here for the Challenger\n\n01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.960\nhe goes yes I was, we talked about that\n\n01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.960\nand so that's when he's saying\n\n01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.960\nsince then we don't cheer until the SRBs are released\n\n01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.960\nand I go\n\n01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:05.960\nwow, and so when I was having my own moments\n\n01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:07.960\nand I'm filming it very poorly\n\n01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.960\non my iPhone\n\n01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.960\nwe're just like not looking through it\n\n01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:13.960\nbut holding it up kind of in the direction of it\n\n01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.960\nand I'm crying and I look over\n\n01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.960\nthe thing that got me, among all the things\n\n01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.960\nwas this guy, it was going\n\n01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:21.960\ngo up Lannis\n\n01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.960\nlike crying\n\n01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.960\nhe's like make it\n\n01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.960\nand everybody there, I'll start crying now\n\n01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.960\nit's friends and family going\n\n01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:31.960\nget those fucking solid rockabusters off\n\n01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.960\nand make it\n\n01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.960\nand it was just like\n\n01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:37.960\nthere's something incredibly\n\n01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:39.960\nlike\n\n01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:41.960\nwe get so irritated by little things humans do\n\n01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.960\nand I'm such a road ragey\n\n01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.960\ncock on the road and stuff like that\n\n01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:47.960\neverything's irritable and Rush can go fuck himself\n\n01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.960\nbut you don't want Rush can go fuck himself\n\n01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.960\nI know, I know\n\n01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.960\nbut the thing is the beauty of\n\n01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.960\nit doesn't have to be people going into space\n\n01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.960\nwhich is the craziest thing in the world\n\n01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:59.960\nbut it's just crazy to go like\n\n01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:01.960\nit's a very\n\n01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.960\nhuman moment\n\n01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:05.960\nwhere I just go like we're awesome\n\n01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.960\nwe're really cool and we have so much\n\n01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.960\nmental capacity and it's very\n\n01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:11.960\ndifficult to do all the things we do\n\n01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.960\nI don't know how you put lead in the fucking pencil\n\n01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.960\nbut there's heroic shit that goes\n\n01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.960\non to every little thing that we do\n\n01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.960\nand it doesn't have to be going into space to make you realize that\n\n01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:21.960\nbut there's so much\n\n01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.960\nnatural heroism\n\n01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:25.960\nthat that's the stuff that always\n\n01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.960\ngets me and then you realize\n\n01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.960\nhow brief it all is\n\n01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.960\nthat's the beauty of it\n\n01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.960\nso that's why sunsets are set\n\n01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:37.960\none day closer to death, it really is\n\n01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:39.960\nI think that's genuinely part of the reason\n\n01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:41.960\nI think seasons\n\n01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:43.960\nare very\n\n01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.960\nI always connected to seasons\n\n01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.960\nwhen I was in Chicago and stuff and I feel\n\n01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.960\nlike part of the reason that California\n\n01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.960\npeople can be so cocky and get all\n\n01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.960\nthat work done and stuff is like\n\n01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.960\nthey don't see\n\n01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.960\nseasons, they don't see like life\n\n01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.960\ndying and coming back and dying and coming back\n\n01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.960\nso then one day they look in the mirror and they're like\n\n01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.960\nI look slightly old, what the fuck\n\n01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.960\nhappened and then they get like work done and stuff\n\n01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.960\nand I really think\n\n01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.960\nseasons give you perspective that\n\n01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.960\nlike you know we sort of\n\n01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.960\ndon't have something, I was thinking about this today\n\n01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.960\nthis is slightly off topic but not really\n\n01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.960\noff topic\n\n01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.960\nwe all know who the first man on the moon was\n\n01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.960\nhow many

what the number is\n\n01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:45.960\nbut it's below 20 I think\n\n01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:47.960\nthe two shuttle things\n\n01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.960\nin the beginning of the

was like 20 some here\n\n01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.960\nI forget the number\n\n01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.960\nbut it's like 18 or something like that\n\n01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.960\naround there of Americans that died\n\n01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:11.960\nthrough our space program\n\n01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.960\nwhich is pretty crazy when you think of the amount\n\n01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:15.960\nthere's been something like 160 or 70 or 80\n\n01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:17.960\nspace shuttle missions or something like that\n\n01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.960\nthe amount of people that

think\n\n01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.960\nflinging us into space\n\n01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.960\nwould have the highest casualty\n\n01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.960\nlooking at the moon and being like\n\n01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:33.960\nlet's go there\n\n01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.960\npeople are gonna die\n\n01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.960\ncause of a lot of death\n\n01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:39.960\nI'm gonna get all the numbers wrong so forgive me\n\n01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.960\nbut I think maybe seven people died\n\n01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:43.960\nin the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge\n\n01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.960\nwhich was considered an engineering marvel\n\n01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:47.960\nthe rule of thumb back then was\n\n01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.960\none person dead for every 100 foot of span\n\n01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:51.960\nthat was considered\n\n01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.960\nfeasible and okay insurance wise\n\n01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:55.960\nthe fact that only\n\n01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.960\nseven people died and held like 1300 feet\n\n01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:59.960\nor more than that\n\n01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.960\nthat was considered like we did it\n\n01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.960\nwe put fuckers in the moon\n\n01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.960\nand only three people had died\n\n01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.960\nI hate to be cynical\n\n01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.960\nbut it's really expensive\n\n01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.960\nto kill an astronaut\n\n01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:13.960\nit's a lot of training\n\n01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:15.960\na poor guy can die making a bridge\n\n01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:17.960\nand that's what it is\n\n01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.960\nthat's why I'm wondering what I'm ranting about\n\n01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:21.960\nthat's a danger of capitalism\n\n01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:23.960\nwhere it's worth something\n\n01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:25.960\nit's great and gets all kinds of

01:29:33.960\nis absolutely\n\n01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.960\nnot only worth more than anything\n\n01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.960\nbut that the president's\n\n01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.960\nhuman life is actually worth\n\n01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.960\nwe can wrap our brain around this\n\n01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:43.960\nthe president's human life is worth the exact same amount\n\n01:29:43.960 -->
