WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:25.000
Music

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Thank you!

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Boy, what a show we have for you tonight.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
We do have a pretty great show.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
What an important show.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
I mean, we got to do the most important thing at the top of it.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
You know, I don't know if it's...

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
but it's got to be dealt with immediately.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
We had a show...

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
The last time we had a show,

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
the feedback was...

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
it was voluminous.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Really?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
I wasn't here for that show, so I don't...

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
I'm not caught up.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Talk to me as if I'm a baby, I don't know.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
There was a problem unique to just societal groupings.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Like, it's a problem that, you know, how do you...

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
how do you solve it?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
We've been through this before.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Harmontown is supposed to be a tribe of misfits.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
We're going to colonize the moon.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
And so what do you do about your Adam Goldbergs?

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
You know, are they...

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Are they mascots?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Because they're the misfits of misfits?

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Or are they somehow an opportunity for us to prove

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
that we too can rule the earth by, you know,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
we just crucify them?

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
And go like, yeah, no, even we have lines.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Oh.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Do I get to vote?

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
I'm voting against that.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
I think, you know, I believe in open systems.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I don't think that Key and Tumblr societies

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
are ever going to evolve.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I think you have to have one code,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
and you have to be able to follow it no matter what.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
And our code is, no one gets bullied, everyone fits in.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
So then last show, like, just from Twitter to Reddit

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
and everywhere in between,

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
a lot of feedback about this guy's laugh.

01:56.000 --> 02:07.000
Now, we're going to bring him up and put a face on this problem

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
because I think...

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
No, not in a shaming way.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Not in a shaming way at all, the opposite.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I want to humanize this guy

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
because I most of all just feel bad for him.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I also then second to that,

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
I feel bad for 30,000 people that were, like,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
unprecedentedly distracted by this guy's laugh.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Well, it's a tough one because you want people to laugh,

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
but then they laugh too much,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
and you're like, all right, calm down.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Their laugh just hits that chimpanzee distress call frequency

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
so it makes people go, like, I'm glad he's having a good time,

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
but now I feel like a spotted leopard's hunting me.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
I don't know.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
His laugh is like a crying baby on an airplane for some people.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
The difficult thing with a society, of course,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
this is the most difficult of all.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
What are we going to outlaw this guy's mirth?

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Tell him, have less fun.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Yeah, that moment when you're least self-conscious and full of joy.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Yeah.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Take it down a notch.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Then everything we say about the government up here,

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
every time a cop stabs a guy, a cop stab people.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
No, they just shoot them.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I don't read the, well, they stab him with those little,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
those flying knives that come out of the knife dispensers.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Okay.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Wait, you're thinking of Scorpion from Mortal Kombat.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Get over here.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Yeah.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
Actually, stay there.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
What was that?

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
No, but it's interesting you're saying that this is the first.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
This is where the line is.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
And we can't, you know, if we introduce this law,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
then everything falls apart.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Yeah.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
All the things that we make fun of governments and corporations

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
for doing when they're like,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
oh, hey, everybody make up a new flavor of Mountain Dew.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Just have fun.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
And fencing your humanity.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
And you're not allowed to do this.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
And you're not allowed to do that.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Then it all breaks down.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
We are judged tonight as a tribe by how we treat laughing men.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
The eyes of God are on us.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
And I don't, no, I'm excited about it because I don't know what the answer is.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
No.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Except that, you know, the first step is always communication.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
Always like, like, like, you know, let's, so if, I assume he's,

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
he's willing to come up because he sounds like he's having a wonderful time.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Are you, is it, it's Doug, right?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Okay.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
We put him in the front row away from the microphones tonight.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Doug.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Have a seat.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Hello.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I will say this.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Right off the bat, I'll tell you what pisses me off, Doug.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
You come to Meltdown every week and that's never been a fucking problem at Meltdown.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
Are we not funny enough for you?

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
It's just never been commented on at Meltdown.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Oh, okay.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
But we don't record Meltdown.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
So there isn't like Twitter, you know.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
It was like, I remember a night when I could hear it and I was like,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
my thing is like, it's not that I don't like it.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
My thing is it makes me feel like a liar.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
It sounds like my uncle's at the show and it's like the cream city comedy competition.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
And he's like, yeah.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
Drive thru his heart for the consumer.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Who's voting?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Who's voting?

05:31.000 --> 05:39.000
It makes me wonder how funny I really am because it sounds like above and beyond.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
But last week, I wasn't really that conscious of it,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
but then it must have been a microphone thing.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
It's like a sound mix thing or something.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
I've never gotten so many tweets about one topic.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
And we talk about race here.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
And you've said a lot of controversial crazy shit.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
I call the Irish dirty little potato people.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
I got seven tweets from Irish people going, you're right.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
We don't care.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Yeah.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
But this fucking, this guy is human Belfast.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Human Belfast.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
The time of troubles are upon us again.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Yeah.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
He's the potato fan of Marmontown.

06:14.000 --> 06:21.000
We need a peace wall built around him so that the Protestant laugh listeners can get along with the Catholic ones.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
So anyway, all right, Doug, I think you've been, you've been, you've been quiet through all this.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
What, what, was it different, was it different last week or last show?

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Uh, it was a little high last week.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
But I, oh no.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
I'll not, I'll pull the microphone away when I laugh.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
Um, but yeah, I know.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Should we, should we, I'm sorry, Doug.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
It's all right.

06:52.000 --> 06:59.000
Well, shouldn't we, shouldn't we get like a, shouldn't we, somebody tell him like a really funny joke so that, so we can measure the.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
He's literally hiding the microphone with his palm right now.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Cause some people might not know what we're talking about.

07:05.000 --> 07:20.000
If we were a sophisticated, like fancy broadcast show, we'd play a clip from last episode where you just hear me going like, like, like, like Jeff at one point, uh, I said, yeah, there's, I was talking about 9 11 conspiracies and back to the future, uh, regarding the Twin Pines parking lot.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
And Jeff said pine 11.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Yeah, put it to your, put it to your mouth.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
See, I love a good pun.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
What got you was pine 11.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Pine 11.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
That's the 9 11 of jokes.

07:41.000 --> 07:51.000
I'm also a huge back to the future fan. So, uh, and I, and I always knew consciously watching that, that yeah, there's only, it's lone pine mall. Cause he hit the pine back then.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
Right. And some guys going like, whoa, what about, why is there only one shower now?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
It's blowing my mind.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
Which is truly not even, not to get too grim, but that's not even a significant event in the 9 11 timeline.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
The time there was one tower.

08:04.000 --> 08:12.000
I know it happened for a couple of minutes on CNN, but like, we don't want to dwell on that. That's not like, oh, the one tower time.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
They fucking came down.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Oh my God, we had so much more hope back then, remember?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Oh, just half as much.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
People were outside chanting, you.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Yeah.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
You.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
And then it was like, it was like electric company.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
And then the other half for that loved the people in the other tower.

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
You.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Remember the electric company?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Snake.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
See, that's funnier than the pine, pine 11.

08:48.000 --> 08:55.000
Well, okay. So, so, I mean, you know, I think that I'm already, I'm already, I'm already encouraged by the conversation.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
You were high.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
That's me. I think we can't ask you to stop having fun.

09:01.000 --> 09:09.000
And I'm certainly, I certainly believe marijuana should be, should be legal, but maybe for you.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
It shouldn't be, it shouldn't be allowed before.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Before the show.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
This is how government start.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Okay.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Maybe for you.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
You kind of passive aggressive law.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Law is law.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
It starts with with with don't eviscerate a prostitute on a foggy cobblestone street.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Just to get rid of Jack the Ripper.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Next thing you know.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
Craft is running the world.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
The Tams is chocolate.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
Wait, that sounds great.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
Next time I get an inkling, I won't before coming to Harmonton.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
How about that?

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Oh, would you get an inkling to, to, when you want to get high, you mean?

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Yeah.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
To ease the back pain.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Oh, really?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Is that what it is?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Because of back pain?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Yeah.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Okay.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Okay.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
It's also, I mean, it's also great.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Like it also feels amazing.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Yeah.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
So Doug, were you aware of this controversy before tonight?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Before?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Jesus.

10:10.000 --> 10:19.000
Like, like, like, like Batman is on the toilet right now.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
She keeps getting halfway up.

10:22.000 --> 10:32.000
Goddamn, is there a, I know that laugh.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
But I'm on the toilet and I'm Batman.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
It's not Bruce Wayne in the toilet.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
It's Batman.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Yeah.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
He's in a cow.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
He's got his outfit.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
That's the weird thing about the, that's the thing they never explore in the movies

10:42.000 --> 10:48.000
is that, is that Bruce Wayne has a really, he extends his dichotomous, like weird schism

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
in its personality to the shits he takes.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Like he's like, I'm going to take a Batman shit.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Yeah.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
The one that flushes my bowels of the scum and crime that have.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I wish I had that option.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
Like every now and then I feel like I want to take a Batman shit, but I can't do it.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Yeah.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
So it's like.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
You just pinch out a little Alfred.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Yeah.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Pinch out a little Alfred.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
I do like five Alfreds in a row rather than one Batman.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
Technically speaking, sir, there is a certain amount of pebbles in your lower colon.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
They could be dispensed of optimum comfort.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
However, it could be put off to a later time.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
And then a Batman shit's like, get it out.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
My parents did.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
I'm going to take the shit out of this shit.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
All right.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Well, okay.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
So Doug, so, so, so what, well, I guess we got a human face.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Well, let's, let's monitor things.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Let's see how it goes.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
We love you and we're in your corner.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
I applaud everyone speaking out.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
I don't know if you needed to be so mean about some of your ways.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
I mean, what was some of the stuff they said, Dan?

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
You don't have to, you know, it's the internet.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
We're starting to realize not everything that you don't like makes you want to kill yourself.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
You don't have to use that language every time.

12:14.000 --> 12:20.000
There's real stuff in the world that should make you want to kill yourself starting with poverty.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
You can just dislike someone's laugh.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
It doesn't make you want to kill yourself.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
And it's not really a place of subtle opinions.

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
It's, it's either you love something and want to marry it or you want to kill it with fire.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
That's the internet.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
Extreme opinions are the only things that make it to the internet.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Alright, well let's, let's, let's thank Doug and Doug.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Thank you, Doug.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Thank you, guys.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
It's the human face that really solves half the problem.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
You just look at him and go, he looks like a fine young gentleman.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
It's also tough because everything we say he laughs at and it's hard to dislike that.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Yeah.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Yeah, I think we figured it out.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
Move away from the microphones and live your life, Doug.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
I was actually going to say that, well, in exchange for that, we told him, there's no way, why am I sharing this?

13:23.000 --> 13:31.000
Now I have to share it just because it's funny that I think Dustin told him like, look, if you, you know, we'll, we'll give you, we'll, we'll, we'll always have that seat away from the microphones available.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
But it's a good seat.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
So now tonight everyone's going to be like,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Look at me, look at me.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
It's, it's, it's gonna, yeah.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
But don't do that.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Be cool.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
There's shame involved, too, don't forget that.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I do most of the show like this.

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
All right, so we, we got, we got, we got, you know, normally I would babble about things I've seen.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
I share my Erin quote of the week.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.660
Yes, you have a music cue for this segment called Aaron my wife Aaron's funniest line of the week

14:10.720 --> 14:12.720
Yeah

14:13.200 --> 14:15.200
That's

14:15.520 --> 14:17.520
Perfect number of beats

14:18.080 --> 14:20.080
About six

14:20.640 --> 14:24.640
I want to make sure I get it right. I wrote it down. We were watching the movie

14:25.360 --> 14:27.800
The movie is called a most violent year

14:27.800 --> 14:31.720
Uh and about uh halfway through it

14:32.360 --> 14:36.040
Uh when joseph cambell says a hero should meet with his goddess

14:36.840 --> 14:40.280
Aaron met with one of her own uh that I didn't realize she was meeting with when she

14:40.920 --> 14:43.240
Exasperatingly said from the bed next to me

14:44.840 --> 14:48.600
Oh god just give them their Oscars so they can stop

14:48.600 --> 14:57.560
It's a movie about a guy who does not want to get involved with the movie that he's in

14:58.600 --> 15:06.120
And he succeeds for the whole movie. Did you you didn't like the movie? I actually did enjoy it quite a bit

15:06.280 --> 15:11.080
But but it's it's kind of remarkable how like the move there's a lot of good movies right now

15:11.080 --> 15:15.560
Am I am I have I passed my curmudgeon phase and I'm now just a wild-eyed babe in the woods

15:15.560 --> 15:19.560
Am I now in that weird creepy uncle like I love pokemon

15:21.080 --> 15:23.720
I I feel like like my birdman was really enjoying

15:23.720 --> 15:26.440
Yeah, you're gonna pick up like like I it's not like it

15:26.760 --> 15:30.920
I thought I thought for a while that I'd do enjoy the kind of movie that might get you know

15:31.240 --> 15:36.920
Might get awards or have some degree of so uh cultural efficacy that you you were down to transformers

15:37.000 --> 15:41.240
Or you had to just watch something in french and and you know, I don't know

15:41.240 --> 15:46.360
I've seen some movies that just saw that that Alan Turing movie the meditation thing if you can see that

15:47.480 --> 15:49.480
Man, it's gonna I don't understand why

15:50.360 --> 15:52.360
Why aren't gay people more angry?

15:53.080 --> 15:57.240
I didn't I didn't know they invented computers and that we killed them for it

15:59.320 --> 16:01.320
I use computers

16:01.320 --> 16:11.800
If I don't understand they're gay people they never did anything they literally are a problem that solves itself

16:11.800 --> 16:13.800
Jesus christ

16:13.800 --> 16:19.160
I would say I lost that you're scared of them like doing anything you don't have to be yeah

16:19.160 --> 16:24.280
There's always another gay person like that they they're not doing they're not trying to do anything

16:24.280 --> 16:30.520
I like the idea of someone is homophobic, but also like logical about it like they're a problem, but they'll solve themselves

16:30.520 --> 16:32.520
I'd say

16:32.520 --> 16:38.040
Even if you put yourself in the shoes of someone who's like terrified like what are you and then we get back to that conversation

16:38.040 --> 16:41.240
Well, obviously we know what they're terrified of they're terrified that they themselves are gay

16:41.240 --> 16:43.640
So they gotta I gotta make a law against how gay I am

16:44.200 --> 16:51.480
Um, but it's not just that I think it is there's people who are fully straight not afraid of being gay who hate gay people

16:52.280 --> 16:55.000
Do you are are we sure about that because there's

16:56.360 --> 16:59.320
There are so many things to hate like are we sure that all

16:59.320 --> 17:04.280
All straight homophobia is not ultimately rooted in

17:05.560 --> 17:07.560
Like a fear of like

17:08.280 --> 17:12.040
Man if this was legal, I would suck every dick in this room

17:13.080 --> 17:15.080
I and I wouldn't know who I am

17:15.640 --> 17:18.440
I'm gonna get to work in the morning. This has to stay

17:19.400 --> 17:21.400
Forbidden if it's legalized

17:21.720 --> 17:23.720
I'm gonna suck so much dick

17:23.720 --> 17:32.280
So I have to fight it well also like the gay marriage thing you can fell out because why would you hate that what if you already hated gay people

17:32.840 --> 17:37.240
Then you hated them for what wearing the police hats and dancing and like

17:37.880 --> 17:43.480
Being like promiscuous like archetypes of like like oh nothing sacred honey child. I'm gay. Whoo

17:43.800 --> 17:44.760
I want to dance

17:44.760 --> 17:51.720
Why for that mindset wouldn't them wanting to get married and to have georgia kite stroll down the street with his husband holding hands

17:51.720 --> 17:56.200
And with it with fro yo it why wouldn't that make you go? Oh, okay fine

17:56.440 --> 18:00.360
The only reason is because you're thinking well, why did I marry a woman then?

18:03.240 --> 18:05.240
I didn't know I could have it all

18:06.840 --> 18:12.600
But it's I think it's also the elected and the thing I love to do in bathrooms

18:12.600 --> 18:20.200
It doesn't count as long as it's in a public bathroom. God can't see through stall doors

18:22.840 --> 18:27.960
Um, I I think then because then they're like oh then it's harder to tell which ones they are

18:28.280 --> 18:32.600
You know, like what are they gonna do save us from overpopulation? What's the worst thing they're gonna do?

18:33.320 --> 18:37.480
Well, but it's true. I mean if you look at like religion and stuff a lot of religions are against that

18:37.560 --> 18:39.640
So it's not just people who are gay and scared of it

18:39.640 --> 18:44.440
It's also people who are scared of something that is different from them or that they see as being different

18:44.520 --> 18:49.160
Those religions come from a time when if you weren't having a baby every nine months you were treasonous

18:50.040 --> 18:52.680
Because our species was at war with the weather

18:53.320 --> 18:55.320
Yeah

18:56.040 --> 19:00.360
Like penguins were eyeing us up for the throne right

19:01.480 --> 19:07.560
Like like well, we're both being eaten by predators who's to say you're not the penguins and we're like keep fucking

19:07.560 --> 19:10.520
In hurry up get more kids in the field

19:10.600 --> 19:14.840
They're gonna pick corn and then you walk in on your friend steve and your friend neal

19:15.400 --> 19:19.880
And you're and you're like guys come on knock it off. We're we're trying something

19:20.760 --> 19:25.400
We're going for something maybe I mean so maybe there was like I'm not I don't want to use the word justification

19:25.480 --> 19:27.480
that's the terrible word but but a

19:28.200 --> 19:31.080
Hey, I mean they were they those people thought stars could talk

19:31.080 --> 19:37.080
They they they they believed that logs were we're we're good luck on thursday if you

19:37.640 --> 19:41.800
Painted them black and they had they had reasons to believe that stuff because they didn't have telescopes

19:41.880 --> 19:45.400
All right, but once you get a telescope you look through it at your gay friend and you go

19:46.120 --> 19:48.280
It just looks like a very up close gay person. I mean

19:50.120 --> 19:52.440
There's Saturn there's there's steve and let's

19:53.000 --> 19:57.960
No, it's true. I mean it's religion is from a time when before we had like we get a new iPhone every year

19:57.960 --> 20:02.200
And we can't get someone to take another pass at the Quran like you can't

20:04.280 --> 20:09.160
There should be some firmware there should be there should be some religion firmware

20:10.280 --> 20:15.560
Just an update that you have to get and then it's like it was a different time women can aim

20:15.800 --> 20:18.280
Own the same amount of property. It's fine

20:18.920 --> 20:20.760
We were wrong then

20:20.760 --> 20:26.280
I think I think we whipped a cauldron into a froth that that our guests is is going to be the most at home

20:26.280 --> 20:28.280
And let's bring up David cross

20:43.640 --> 20:45.640
All right

20:51.080 --> 20:55.640
There was some extended applause there, I think uh, I think your legacy is palpable in this room

20:55.640 --> 20:58.840
Can you can you uh in post can you give it another minute?

21:01.400 --> 21:03.400
One of you was clapping too hard

21:04.440 --> 21:09.720
I know there's a there's one guy in the front that makes looping impossible. That's like there's always like this seam

21:11.800 --> 21:18.520
But uh, yeah, well, we just started we started touching on this the unsolvable but always fun subject of like

21:19.000 --> 21:24.040
Of of a most violent year sucking. I know I saw it. I did not care for it

21:24.040 --> 21:28.680
Uh, for so many reasons, uh, I thought he sounded a little too much like Andy Garcia

21:29.320 --> 21:33.000
I don't care about that. I just thought I mean it's uh, it was

21:34.200 --> 21:36.200
uh

21:36.200 --> 21:39.080
It was everything about it was halfway

21:39.720 --> 21:47.800
The the the story was halfway the resolution was halfway the acting was halfway. Well, that was it was like

21:48.280 --> 21:49.560
um

21:49.560 --> 21:51.560
Well halfway to good, but it was um

21:51.560 --> 21:56.040
It was like uh, you it's like what your wife was saying. It's like they're they're

21:56.600 --> 22:01.080
They all think they're gonna get an Oscar you can tell they're all they're all that's in the back of their heads

22:01.240 --> 22:06.200
I like that you're saying everything is halfway, but the name is the most extreme name possible

22:07.080 --> 22:13.800
A most violent year. I know we kept thinking because in the beginning there's like I got a gas truck gets gets hijacked

22:13.880 --> 22:19.160
And then Aaron and I were saying oh, is this like the cold open and as the truck drives away you pan over to a calendar

22:19.160 --> 22:21.160
And it says january 1st

22:24.680 --> 22:26.680
Is the whole movie just like

22:27.960 --> 22:29.960
I I really uh

22:31.080 --> 22:34.760
Yeah, I didn't I didn't care for that movie and uh, have you seen some stuff you do care for?

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Did what did you think of bird man?

22:37.000 --> 22:37.880
um

22:37.880 --> 22:42.360
I I enjoyed watching it and I I liked the first two of the six endings

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I preferred the first two

22:45.000 --> 22:51.560
Then endings uh, three four five and six. I they lost me but um, I will say like I got

22:52.040 --> 22:56.760
There's some movies I get to a point around if I can get the three quarters through

22:57.640 --> 23:03.880
I've already written the mental blog entry of like why this is the best movie ever and if the the last 20 minutes can

23:03.960 --> 23:06.760
Take a fucking those dive and I'll kind of just push it out of the rug

23:06.920 --> 23:10.680
Well, the it was it was really enjoyable to watch the acting was great

23:11.160 --> 23:13.000
uh

23:13.000 --> 23:17.400
But I I I'll tell you where I really hit a roadblock

23:17.400 --> 23:22.680
And it was a big one because I really wasn't enjoying it up until this moment, but the the scene with the

23:23.400 --> 23:25.160
uh, theater reviewer

23:25.160 --> 23:30.840
The dialogue was written. It's it felt to me like the dialogue that she her review

23:31.400 --> 23:37.560
And then the thing that he says back to her and then her actual review later all sounded like somebody who's never read a review

23:38.440 --> 23:42.120
Because that's not how reviewers talk. That's how when you parody or if you're like, uh, uh

23:42.120 --> 23:43.080
A

23:43.080 --> 23:46.040
Sophomore in college. That's what you think a reviewer

23:46.600 --> 23:49.640
Uh, and it's just it was bogus. That's a good point

23:50.440 --> 23:55.480
Like the Emma stone monologue when she's yelling at him for giving a shit about something that's all out of ego

23:55.560 --> 23:59.400
And he doesn't he pretends he's above twitter, but he's doing this ridiculous thing

23:59.400 --> 24:04.040
I was like, I thought that monologue was really great. It was a well-written like teenage daughter monologue yelling

24:04.040 --> 24:07.560
There's a lot of great stuff in there. I just had a but that was the one

24:07.560 --> 24:13.160
Uh dialogue wise, uh, the one yeah, I mean that like that's not how they talk if they were as good at writing

24:13.160 --> 24:17.160
But that that reviewer could have easily just been super like they could have written up to her

24:17.720 --> 24:23.640
And had her be a normal a human with her own value system is the hero of her own story with lots of thoughtful things to say

24:23.640 --> 24:27.640
And it would have been just as good. You're right. I never I didn't even think about that. There is a way to hate things

24:27.720 --> 24:31.960
Thank you. No, uh, did you guys see the hobbit?

24:31.960 --> 24:33.960
I

24:38.040 --> 24:43.800
Have I saw the second movie and I was like the second of three. Yeah, yeah, it was one book by the way

24:43.800 --> 24:45.640
I don't know if you guys know there was one book

24:45.640 --> 24:49.960
You can't make three movies in a one book. It's so baffling like I love the lord of the rings movie so much

24:49.960 --> 24:52.840
So each one of these I watch I said this on twitter

24:52.840 --> 24:56.760
But to me like lord of the rings was like making love with the love of your life

24:56.760 --> 25:04.840
And hobbit is like jacking off on a sex doll you found in the trash. It's still a fine way to spend your time

25:05.800 --> 25:08.360
You just don't want your wife to be around for one of them, you know

25:08.600 --> 25:15.720
Wait, are you are you jerking off in the exact space place where you found the sex doll? Yeah, no, it's still in the trash

25:16.040 --> 25:17.320
Oh, okay

25:17.320 --> 25:21.160
So to onlookers you're just jacking off into the trash and you're like no, no, no, there's a sex doll

25:21.160 --> 25:28.360
Right, right, right, right a little bit of a thrill to it. Yeah. Yeah, there's an excitement to it. There's a weird

25:29.080 --> 25:30.920
part where there's like

25:30.920 --> 25:32.920
You know, there's like 15 new dwarves in it

25:33.640 --> 25:36.600
There's like I don't I haven't seen any of those things. I don't uh

25:37.160 --> 25:42.760
Not not for you know, not like out of anger or obstinance. I just those things are so silly and

25:43.720 --> 25:49.320
Even even the original lord of the rings. I didn't see him though. Okay, wait. Oh gosh. I didn't see it

25:49.320 --> 25:51.320
I you're like a unicorn

25:53.320 --> 25:56.360
Ironically, I don't I mean I don't get uh, I mean I don't

25:57.160 --> 26:01.400
I don't no judgment. I just know I know myself enough to know I'm not gonna like it

26:01.400 --> 26:06.760
Yeah, yeah, so so that's a good time to bring up that you now just finally I say finally have

26:07.160 --> 26:12.440
Have launched a career as a director you just made that movie hits which I haven't seen and frankly didn't know existed

26:12.440 --> 26:19.160
Uh, which looks from the trailer to be like everything you would want when you hear that David cross is directing

26:20.040 --> 26:24.200
Well, uh after the last 10 minutes of what I've just said it better be

26:24.760 --> 26:26.760
The most amazing fucking

26:27.320 --> 26:29.320
Perfect. It has to be perfect

26:30.200 --> 26:31.240
Uh

26:31.240 --> 26:32.600
But it looks great and more importantly

26:32.600 --> 26:37.880
I think the reason why I thought you might want to come on here is because I'm sure you're already at your kickstarter goal

26:37.880 --> 26:44.040
Because you're only asking for the kickstarter pitch. I saw was that you you made this movie. It's it's good

26:44.920 --> 26:50.840
The distributors involved had this plan to do like new york and la and then throw it onto itunes and come up

26:50.840 --> 26:51.720
May yep

26:51.720 --> 26:55.240
And and you know whether yeah, and you're and you're just going come on

26:55.320 --> 27:01.320
Let's do the let's do the 20 city thing and you looked into it and it costs like a nominal amount

27:01.320 --> 27:09.320
They just wouldn't the nobody was interested in pursuing that and the and i'm not knocking uh, the the people involved

27:09.320 --> 27:14.120
But the you know distributors are doing a job. They don't care about the movie per se

27:14.120 --> 27:19.400
They want to get the best deal they can or at least the sales agents who you hire to represent you to

27:19.880 --> 27:23.240
Make the deal with distributors, which I found out later. I'm not I'm not

27:24.440 --> 27:28.440
Well-versed by choice in the business of aspect of things

27:28.440 --> 27:33.880
Uh, uh, I just don't care to I should care to know I'm sure my

27:34.760 --> 27:42.120
Wife would be happier about that, but uh, I I just don't I can't I don't want to think about those things and and um

27:44.360 --> 27:49.160
And so the the what they were what the offers were very there were the absolute

27:49.880 --> 27:51.880
Standard thing, you know

27:51.880 --> 27:57.800
Like you were saying it's new york and la and then pick four cities out of the ten biggest cities and they go there

27:58.680 --> 28:00.680
You know one college town, you know

28:01.400 --> 28:03.880
Got to get it in an harbor man, you know and um

28:04.840 --> 28:07.560
And then that was it and then as you said and and that was really

28:08.120 --> 28:11.080
Kind of depressing and then the producers were the ones who said let's

28:11.640 --> 28:19.240
Let's figure out a way to get this movie in theaters that it would never play in and uh, and so I credit them

28:19.240 --> 28:24.600
They're the ones who came up with the idea and they went to a bit torrent and and then we'd we had the idea to

28:25.080 --> 28:29.240
To do the Kickstarter, which just allows us to get the movie. We're already at uh

28:30.200 --> 28:37.960
If should it trigger we've got 35 cities not even I mean towns places. I've never even heard of saint saint

28:38.840 --> 28:41.000
Thompsonville in vermont and I don't know

28:41.960 --> 28:43.800
uh

28:43.800 --> 28:47.480
I mean places it would never play like um, uh, Daytona

28:47.480 --> 28:50.680
What just in the middle of the racetracks?

28:53.080 --> 28:55.080
Yep, just a guy

28:55.080 --> 29:00.360
The one guy who's not into racing in Daytona and he lives in the middle. He's running to the drivers so they can see it

29:01.560 --> 29:03.560
He's got he's got it on his iphone

29:04.600 --> 29:09.240
I was like when bugs bunny had that hill that hole that they built a construction site around

29:09.320 --> 29:12.120
Yeah, and then in the future. He was the opposite. He was the only guy

29:12.360 --> 29:13.640
Yeah

29:13.640 --> 29:18.840
So is it like these theaters sort of signed up to be like hey, we wanted to play in our theater

29:18.920 --> 29:23.560
So if if this Kickstarter thing goes then we would like to play because it's pay what you want

29:23.800 --> 29:28.280
So uh in order to do that we need at least enough money to get into the theater

29:28.280 --> 29:32.680
It doesn't cost a whole lot, but you have to it does cost something you have to rent the theater pay for the staff

29:33.400 --> 29:38.840
Get your uh, make sure the film can play in their system. Um, and and you know a small

29:38.840 --> 29:43.080
All modicum of uh, you know marketing and stuff gets mads out

29:43.480 --> 29:44.680
um

29:44.680 --> 29:46.680
And that would allow us to go to uh

29:47.880 --> 29:53.000
It was uh 22. I think we figured it would allow us to get to and uh, and now we're at all these

29:53.640 --> 29:55.640
theaters have approached us and uh,

29:55.800 --> 30:01.720
It's cool. I've never been done before. Yeah, this is like I've never heard of any bit torrent is the one who's distributing it

30:01.960 --> 30:05.960
Online you said right there is this is the first movie that bit torrent is

30:05.960 --> 30:09.720
Uh, yeah putting out there officially officially. Yeah

30:10.280 --> 30:12.840
Yeah, yeah after years in the business. Yeah

30:13.320 --> 30:16.840
Yeah, they've uh before this they ever make any money

30:18.360 --> 30:21.820
Yeah before this they've put out every movie ever made

30:22.840 --> 30:24.840
Yeah

30:25.240 --> 30:27.800
Yes unofficially, but that's such a cool

30:28.520 --> 30:32.840
Like how did the bit torrent thing happen like that was the producers they they're the ones who went out

30:32.840 --> 30:35.560
Uh, you know, we were all little uh

30:36.360 --> 30:38.680
You know the movie screened well at Sundance. Um

30:39.720 --> 30:41.240
and

30:41.240 --> 30:43.240
I don't think anybody had this uh

30:43.800 --> 30:48.120
You know illusion that we were gonna somehow become this, you know, amazing

30:48.680 --> 30:50.200
You know one of those

30:50.200 --> 30:53.800
bidding war things where harvey weinstein is you know in between

30:54.520 --> 30:58.200
Champagne shots and piles of blow is like I want this movie, you know

30:58.200 --> 31:02.520
So Skyping from his yacht on the on top of a mountain and um

31:04.840 --> 31:06.840
You know the yacht's on the mountain

31:07.640 --> 31:10.360
The yacht's on the mountain. Yeah, very he's very wealthy

31:11.880 --> 31:13.880
Yeah, it's his mountain

31:15.080 --> 31:19.720
Uh, it's something his dad said he couldn't do it's the one thing

31:21.080 --> 31:24.840
Hey, man, that's a good engine trying to do shit your dad says you can't do

31:24.840 --> 31:30.920
Um, so it's yeah, you're where I mean you were within spitting distance of your goal when I looked

31:31.400 --> 31:37.320
Several days ago, um, but more money's probably better than than less if you're interested the more money we get the more

31:38.360 --> 31:41.640
Theaters we go right right so go to the Kickstarter if you're interested you can find it

31:42.200 --> 31:45.800
Really easily and uh, you know first give to leukemia if you've got like that

31:46.360 --> 31:48.360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

31:49.480 --> 31:53.000
No, no, no, no see that's that's short-sighted thinking

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
All right

31:55.960 --> 31:59.320
Listen his movie's coming out once leukemia is gonna be there

32:00.360 --> 32:04.280
Leukemia will keep is the slogan for the movie. Don't worry

32:05.320 --> 32:11.960
I mean a hundred dollars to the uh leukemia foundation ain't doing I mean that's like that's nothing. No, that's nothing

32:12.200 --> 32:15.560
No, and a hundred dollars to us. You're gonna make some

32:16.440 --> 32:18.440
Loser with leukemia laugh for two

32:18.440 --> 32:20.440
You know

32:21.000 --> 32:26.120
I mean you give it give him a little escape two of the last hours of his life

32:27.080 --> 32:29.080
he'll laugh

32:30.040 --> 32:36.920
It's it's 2015 so now we have to follow that with a paragraph of we're not saying it's funny to have leukemia

32:37.240 --> 32:40.440
We're saying it's so unfunny to have it that it's funny and the blah blah blah blah

32:40.760 --> 32:46.840
Um the uh, yeah, I I understand that the money that goes to leukemia a lot of times what happens because it's such an intense

32:46.840 --> 32:48.840
diagnosis to give

32:49.000 --> 32:52.040
That a lot of times they'll just give the person a hundred dollars along with

32:53.880 --> 32:55.880
Hey good news and bad news

32:55.880 --> 33:00.280
Like so that is that is a that is a furnace that you're shoveling your money into it

33:00.680 --> 33:06.440
It needs to be shoveled in but but you could you could light a little little dollar bill on fire for david cross

33:06.440 --> 33:07.960
And it'll go a lot longer

33:07.960 --> 33:11.720
Uh, I don't I really really did make a pretty

33:11.720 --> 33:19.320
We made a point that was like hey gift to his movie more than gift to leukemia and it made sense. Yeah

33:21.560 --> 33:27.000
Yeah, yeah, I mean it's that's the great thing about uh this podcast is if if you're

33:27.960 --> 33:29.960
If you pay attention you might learn something

33:32.520 --> 33:38.840
Movies called hits it's called hits right called hits. Yes. So is there is there ever going to be a rule about

33:38.840 --> 33:43.240
So you got your um, you got your hebdo

33:43.880 --> 33:48.120
Deaths with the more of the mohammed thing. This is a fuck of a segue. Yeah

33:50.920 --> 33:55.160
And so this isn't the first time it's happened and it's like like this thing keeps coming up where it's like, okay

33:55.160 --> 34:00.680
So some people get get get really upset about the fact that for instance, okay, so these guys are

34:01.400 --> 34:05.320
Uh a cartoon made them hurt people and that obviously makes them the bad guy

34:05.320 --> 34:10.200
But then why cnn? Well, you're doing the story and then you hold up the cartoon as it blurred out

34:10.520 --> 34:14.680
And then there's other people and I because I don't want to jump on that bandwagon and go well

34:15.000 --> 34:16.920
But wait a minute. You're watching cnn

34:16.920 --> 34:23.000
What are you a big fan of like overriding all societal like taboo because otherwise there would just be

34:23.240 --> 34:28.200
You know what a corporation would put on tv to make you keep watching it would just be a big dick with toothpaste coming out of it

34:28.200 --> 34:29.160
like

34:29.160 --> 34:31.880
They wouldn't they wouldn't if you didn't give a fuck they wouldn't give a fuck

34:31.880 --> 34:37.400
They would just be twinkies and fucking tits on the tv and they would go back go back to the dick with toothpaste

34:39.160 --> 34:42.120
What I backed off of that because that's a pitch that i'm trying to sell

34:43.960 --> 34:48.280
Well, what kind of toothpaste did you guys see did you guys see stripe red and white?

34:48.360 --> 34:51.720
Did you guys see sparkly bubblegum like kid toothpaste?

34:52.520 --> 34:54.520
red and white stripes would be gross

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Right, that's crazy

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
I

35:01.720 --> 35:04.600
Just I'm saying I don't want to see a red stripe coming out of my dick

35:05.400 --> 35:08.600
But you want to see other kind of toothpaste coming out of your dick

35:08.680 --> 35:14.920
Whoa, if I came and it didn't hurt and it was blue with crystals in it

35:16.200 --> 35:18.440
I I would I would I would be like

35:19.160 --> 35:21.160
Whoa, what the fuck

35:21.160 --> 35:27.720
But if I if there was a red stripe in it, I'd be like fuck. There's a difference

35:27.800 --> 35:31.720
You don't think the crystals are gonna hurt the inside of your urethra. It's so naive

35:31.720 --> 35:34.360
I just said it didn't hurt. That's why I prefer it was not hurting because

35:34.840 --> 35:38.440
Okay, I did say that I I would I would think you're more of a toms guy

35:42.520 --> 35:47.720
Given your druthers I just I don't even come I might but the head of my dick is one of those crystals

35:47.720 --> 35:53.240
You just rub it on your skin and it uh, I switched I switched to deodorant

35:54.200 --> 35:56.200
But finish that sentence

35:57.080 --> 36:00.200
It didn't make sense because I switched to deodorant analogy and it doesn't make sense

36:00.440 --> 36:04.600
Finish the sentence. So I see so deodorant. Yeah, that's so you don't get Alzheimer's

36:04.600 --> 36:07.800
So when you when you masturbate you don't get Alzheimer's right

36:08.440 --> 36:12.520
Because what you do no you it is the crystal. Oh no the crystal. All right, all right

36:12.520 --> 36:20.040
The crystal deodorant is because people are afraid they because uh, uh, somebody read something somewhere 15 years ago

36:20.440 --> 36:25.960
And they're like, oh shit. This has aluminum in it. That's gonna make give us Alzheimer's. So give me that rock

36:27.960 --> 36:31.640
Give me the rock that the woman who calls herself the a good witch

36:32.600 --> 36:35.480
Sold me on venice beach for 60 dollars

36:36.520 --> 36:40.040
There's a witchcraft store. There was a witchcraft store in my neighborhood

36:40.040 --> 36:44.120
Where they would sell like bullshit like that and it just shut down and now it's a shoe store

36:44.440 --> 36:49.320
And I was like kind of happy and sad at the same time because it's like kind of fucked that woman

36:49.560 --> 36:51.080
but also

36:51.080 --> 36:53.080
I could buy shoes anywhere, but

36:53.240 --> 36:57.240
But here's the thing here's the thing about those folks. I don't think they're I I

36:57.800 --> 37:02.200
You don't think they're hucksters. No, I don't I don't think a lot of the people that I'm that I

37:02.680 --> 37:08.520
Think about when I think of you know, like those women or guys on venice beach or in woodstock or

37:08.520 --> 37:11.240
Or, you know, san francisco, whatever the fuck they are and

37:13.160 --> 37:15.160
You know, uh

37:15.160 --> 37:22.680
I don't think they're trying to rip you off. I really don't I think they're I think they're, uh, uh, naive and dumb sort of

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Because they believe those things but

37:28.280 --> 37:30.280
But now now I'm getting close to

37:30.760 --> 37:34.120
I'm describing, you know people in my life that I love so I can't

37:34.120 --> 37:37.160
I have to step it back a notch

37:38.840 --> 37:41.000
I I mean there was a the so

37:42.680 --> 37:46.760
What a pin in my so you're holding up a a picture of mohammed on the news

37:47.720 --> 37:51.640
And they're blurring out really derailed by the toothpaste out of the dick thing, huh?

37:52.280 --> 37:55.320
So now next to that somebody tweeted me this story, which I didn't know was a thing

37:55.880 --> 37:58.920
If you live in new york and you go back and forth between new york and israel

37:59.160 --> 38:01.080
So I don't know how long this has been a thing

38:01.080 --> 38:05.480
But someone tweeted me an article about how it's a thing the heretti on the yes. Yes

38:06.440 --> 38:10.040
They they can I put a quick plug for a website?

38:10.600 --> 38:12.040
Seriously, I'm not joking

38:12.040 --> 38:19.000
Where they have there's a website called failed messiah.com and I am I am one of the very few people who

38:19.720 --> 38:26.120
Says that we should make more fun of jews and I and I not reform jews. They're boring, but I'm talking about

38:26.600 --> 38:28.600
Orthodox jews. They're just

38:28.600 --> 38:31.640
Awful terrible backwards people that

38:33.240 --> 38:35.240
That they really are

38:35.400 --> 38:37.400
sexist

38:37.400 --> 38:39.400
And there's a lot of

38:40.040 --> 38:42.040
They're just terrible. They're terrible

38:42.040 --> 38:47.160
And um, well, but they there are always they always linked to those articles

38:48.600 --> 38:52.280
And I think well, it's so so there's a little theme that we constantly see happen

38:52.280 --> 38:57.800
What is the article about well the article is that well the article that I read was an editorial by somebody that was just fed up

38:57.800 --> 39:03.560
And just going like enough already. Can we make this fucking illegal? You cannot obstruct a god damn tell them what what is it?

39:03.560 --> 39:09.560
Yeah, I don't understand. Okay, so if I if I'm explaining this correctly, there's a you know as you get into the more

39:10.200 --> 39:12.200
orthodox

39:12.520 --> 39:18.200
Forms of Judaism there's what depending on what sect I don't know if I'm using the right language, but there's some dudes

39:18.200 --> 39:20.120
It's a chesedom the heretti there

39:20.120 --> 39:26.440
There's different factions of all if you're ultra orthodox and they they're all kinds of ultra orthodox

39:26.440 --> 39:29.800
And they can't they get on the plane and they go, oh

39:30.440 --> 39:32.840
I I can't sit next to a woman

39:33.400 --> 39:36.440
But not I can't I won't all right, right?

39:36.840 --> 39:39.880
Um, and so some you know, it's uh, you read the comment section

39:39.880 --> 39:43.000
It's like on fire and it's like it and all kind of comes down to me for like well

39:43.000 --> 39:49.080
How is this is this is this guy an 18 year old traveler and like like like what is this really the first time that he's

39:49.320 --> 39:53.160
You know, is he is he actually being brave this person who's going like oh, shit

39:53.160 --> 39:58.520
I I'm being pressured by this secular machine to like do this thing. No one warned me about this

39:58.760 --> 40:04.440
Because it's it when I read the article is like this this stinks of airlines need to nut up

40:05.000 --> 40:08.440
Like corporations that we give all this power to stop letting women on your plane

40:12.120 --> 40:18.680
Put a fucking sign up explaining to anyone flying from new york to israel or vice versa that that there is a very likely chance

40:18.680 --> 40:20.680
You will be sitting next to half the population

40:20.680 --> 40:22.680
50 percent chance

40:23.240 --> 40:25.240
Well, you know, they're also

40:25.960 --> 40:30.760
point zero zero one percent of the population who still believes in this archaic

40:31.400 --> 40:33.960
thing and and we but we accept it

40:34.440 --> 40:40.120
Um, and and one of the issues and I didn't read this particular editorial, but I know one of the issues is that

40:40.680 --> 40:47.000
Uh, it was in particular was delta airlines. Um, they don't want to lose their business because is it a it is a lot

40:47.000 --> 40:52.040
That's exactly what I'm saying. It always ends up being money. It's never this difficult west wing thing where it's like

40:52.040 --> 40:55.800
Well, what's the right thing to do? It's money. You follow the money. It's somebody's being greedy by not

40:56.360 --> 41:01.560
Explaining to these people and it's fucking awful what they do what they what they let them get away with and eventually

41:01.880 --> 41:07.960
Eventually people are are pressured and it's it's a major flight new york to israel. You know, it's uh, it's a long

41:08.520 --> 41:12.040
But I mean, it's like if you got to get there. I assume you have to get there for a reason

41:12.040 --> 41:14.040
You're not like I got a couple days ago

41:14.040 --> 41:16.760
You know, so so eventually people are like

41:17.560 --> 41:19.880
Fine. I'll give them a right about you. You know

41:20.920 --> 41:28.280
Uh, the the the I mean, I think that the I I put those side by side for one because I don't want anybody to perceive

41:28.360 --> 41:33.400
Me talking about what we got to figure this out as having to do with any particular religion

41:33.400 --> 41:39.080
I think that all of religion in its most like kind of like concentrated forms

41:39.080 --> 41:43.720
Um, the word archaic could be used like like like because it's like let's face it

41:43.720 --> 41:49.720
These are being held over from from times before airplanes and things and so they're they're rubbing up against modern

41:50.280 --> 41:51.880
completely secularized society

41:51.880 --> 41:57.320
It's like what are the rules because we're all wearing pants and if you get on a plane without pants and you say

41:57.720 --> 42:00.600
It's my religion. They're gonna say I don't give a shit

42:01.000 --> 42:06.520
And so if and I want people to fess up that it's not it's not really about freedom of religion

42:06.520 --> 42:11.640
If a airline is cow-towing to yeah, fuck that anyway. I mean, uh

42:12.360 --> 42:15.640
I mean because if it was I would I would apply I would be like, well, okay

42:15.640 --> 42:20.040
Let's try really hard to figure out how nobody ever ever has their bubble births. Let's try

42:20.200 --> 42:22.520
Let's try and see if we can do it make it happen

42:22.920 --> 42:28.600
Uh, but we'll do it in tears so that some for instance some poor woman who didn't buy a ticket to this fucking ride

42:28.680 --> 42:34.280
Or if she bought a ticket to the plane, but not this goddamn global roller coaster gets on a plane has a guy in an Indiana Jones hat

42:34.360 --> 42:35.960
get on the plane

42:35.960 --> 42:41.720
Look at her stifle vomit go to this flight attendant then double back fall back into the I mean

42:41.880 --> 42:44.520
What do these people do when they're sealed in this tube? There's women everywhere

42:44.680 --> 42:49.560
Um, but and then some is explaining that they can't they can't do this and they can't do that

42:49.720 --> 42:55.320
And everyone in the plane is like what the fuck I'm like he said I'm on a goddamn deadline. I got a whale at this wall

42:58.920 --> 43:03.640
Or actually that's the one thing I don't have to do right the whale the wall wales for you is that uh, I don't know

43:03.640 --> 43:08.360
I only know it by name. I assume the wailing wall. Yeah, it's I think it's I know you go and you dovid

43:08.440 --> 43:10.920
And you pray and then you put the prayer slips

43:11.720 --> 43:13.720
Into the cracks in the wall

43:14.280 --> 43:19.560
And then and then at night between midnight and 12 o'clock 5 a.m. God tiptoes in

43:20.440 --> 43:21.960
They seal it up

43:21.960 --> 43:23.960
it got tiptoes in

43:24.840 --> 43:26.840
and uh, he

43:27.480 --> 43:32.280
It's and it's they he and Muhammad and jesus go to the dome of the rock, right?

43:32.280 --> 43:37.480
Where they all had there were the three major world religions

43:37.960 --> 43:42.840
Uh, have claimed to that the dome of the rock and then they on the temple mount and then

43:43.480 --> 43:49.240
They each go in there and it's all uh, they've reduced they've figured out science has figured out that

43:50.920 --> 43:56.840
They've they've reduced it to the actual grain of sand that each one can claim to and then they all go and they

43:57.480 --> 43:59.480
This is between 12 and 12 o'clock 5

43:59.480 --> 44:05.880
They they lick the grain of sand. They lick it. They lick it and then they wink to each other

44:08.040 --> 44:11.320
Give a little pat on the back side and then they go they're separate way and they go

44:12.360 --> 44:14.360
They're like what a racket, huh?

44:16.360 --> 44:18.360
True story

44:18.440 --> 44:24.840
I want to I want to start a religion where if you're a woman on the plane you'd have to sit next to an orthodox jew

44:24.840 --> 44:26.840
And

44:27.960 --> 44:29.960
Then let's see what happens

44:30.600 --> 44:33.800
I uh, yeah, I mean, there's a you know, there's the thing of what you wanted to scream

44:33.880 --> 44:37.960
What we'll start your own airline, but it's like what is that a mandate? We all got to be like fucking they have one

44:37.960 --> 44:44.840
It's called LL. Get on fucking LL. Is that yeah, I the so okay, so what's that? I think the pale israel's

44:46.280 --> 44:48.280
I mean israel being a secular

44:48.600 --> 44:51.160
country, um, it's their their airline

44:51.160 --> 44:55.160
They're not oh, oh, yeah, okay, and what are the what is okay?

44:55.320 --> 45:00.920
So if that or this is a hugely important question that know that that what did they do on that airline?

45:00.920 --> 45:02.920
They must be no strangers to this concept

45:03.080 --> 45:05.240
So they must have a speedy way of dealing with it

45:05.880 --> 45:10.120
And what is that? I don't know. I I've never been on that flight nor would I ever I know

45:11.080 --> 45:12.840
It was it was more of a rhetorical question

45:12.840 --> 45:15.400
I'm saying like this is the question that needs to be asked like well, okay

45:15.480 --> 45:19.320
What is the what are the experts do that are in charge of both?

45:19.320 --> 45:21.960
Ex expedient aviation and

45:22.520 --> 45:25.000
Uh, you know not offending, uh

45:25.560 --> 45:32.040
Here's the core of what bothers me about this situation is they have the ability because they buy their

45:32.680 --> 45:37.320
Tickets and blocks and they travel together in groups. They have the ability

45:38.280 --> 45:39.880
to

45:39.880 --> 45:44.040
Buy seats around them or make sure that they're all sitting next to each other and not

45:44.040 --> 45:50.440
Delay the flight, but they they truly don't care and part of the reason they don't care is because they are

45:50.920 --> 45:57.000
Led to believe that they are pure and they are better than everyone on that plane. Who's not an orthodox do they're better

45:57.880 --> 46:02.280
God views them as better people those other people are not worthy

46:03.080 --> 46:05.080
And that's and so they don't even care

46:05.720 --> 46:11.320
That's part of the the the mindset that bothers me you percent. You're like you think like they're

46:11.320 --> 46:16.520
They know in advance. They're like, well, we're gonna get on the plane. There's gonna be some chicks and we're gonna have to

46:16.680 --> 46:22.200
Of course they do. We're gonna hold everybody up. That's pretty insidious. I mean, it's like like like your religious

46:22.680 --> 46:25.240
They could take a a a simple

46:26.120 --> 46:28.120
action to

46:28.840 --> 46:31.320
Not to protect their own little corner of the world

46:31.480 --> 46:38.680
Yeah, and also to be to be a decent human being with amongst other human beings and a live and let live way to be

46:38.680 --> 46:45.080
Accommodating to be polite to have a you know, civil discourse. They could they could do that should they want

46:45.720 --> 46:47.000
But they don't

46:47.000 --> 46:52.760
Yeah, I think and they don't care to I think there's something like like I'll I'll move off of this hot oven

46:54.520 --> 47:02.280
With this I think like I you this conversation confirms my thought like I'm more prone to I mean kumail was raised

47:02.280 --> 47:07.400
Uh, uh, uh Muslim, but it's not practicing. Is that accurate?

47:15.800 --> 47:17.800
What if he is gone?

47:20.040 --> 47:22.040
Yeah, amazing

47:22.920 --> 47:26.760
I like the idea of someone who's like so against orthodox Judaism

47:26.760 --> 47:32.120
Um, but it must have come on. No, it is a it's a razor thin wire. This guy walks theologically

47:33.960 --> 47:37.960
There actually is a razor thin wire in Islam where that's how you get to heaven

47:37.960 --> 47:42.120
Is it you have to cross the razor thin wire and if you fall down you go to hell? That's actually true

47:42.280 --> 47:46.360
That's actually that's so weird because well, that's that makes sense scientifically

47:48.120 --> 47:50.120
That I get that I understand

47:50.120 --> 47:58.360
Um, I I I'm I'm you you guys I think like yeah, you're you're I'm not gonna get any argument out of you when I say something

47:58.360 --> 48:02.840
That's part some valve in my body makes me go like well, don't say it all the way

48:03.240 --> 48:08.280
Because to some degree I feel like I'm speaking on behalf of a lot of people that I don't like when I say this a lot of

48:08.360 --> 48:13.720
Organizations a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the world around us that I don't like when I say yeah

48:14.280 --> 48:18.520
Um get over your bogeymen to the extent that it's going to affect other people

48:18.520 --> 48:21.080
You just gotta there has to be like this global

48:21.800 --> 48:27.560
Recognition that you know if you're Amish you you can be as Amish as you want on your Amish farm

48:27.880 --> 48:31.560
And unfortunately it's like still you're being marginalized and you're being disempowered

48:31.560 --> 48:35.400
But we got to move on with this fucking planet. We got to get off it before it dies

48:35.480 --> 48:41.560
We do that with lasers late. You say you say lasers are are bad luck. Uh, we don't believe you

48:42.040 --> 48:46.280
Um, we I got to get to work. Um, I'm a woman

48:46.280 --> 48:52.040
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna grow a dick. I gotta invent a laser in israel

48:52.520 --> 48:56.280
Um, so so I I think that it's like we we have made that choice

48:56.360 --> 49:01.640
We've done but we have we also like feel very queasy about saying it because I don't

49:02.760 --> 49:04.200
And that's I think that's admirable

49:04.200 --> 49:07.400
I do because it actually is like it's easier to do what I'm doing

49:07.400 --> 49:09.720
Which is be Allen all day like like like kind of

49:09.720 --> 49:15.960
I appreciate the the like let's let's uh, you know be

49:16.600 --> 49:19.880
Civil about this. Let's listen all sides. Let's let's think about this, but uh

49:21.320 --> 49:27.160
I didn't have this early on uh, and now at 50. I really don't have it and I I live in

49:29.640 --> 49:36.200
An area upstate in New York and um, it's one of the poorest it's near one of the poorest

49:36.200 --> 49:38.200
Uh

49:38.360 --> 49:45.640
Counties and it's the poorest county because there's a place called. I don't know if I'm pronouncing correctly curious joel and it's um

49:46.360 --> 49:48.360
it's where

49:49.160 --> 49:57.160
Tens of thousands of orthodox have come in and they're um, and they breed like fucking like catholic rabbits and um

49:58.520 --> 50:00.280
And uh

50:00.280 --> 50:02.840
You know, they're they're sapping the public services

50:02.840 --> 50:09.880
Uh, and and the the monies that are and and they're they're like, you know, nine to a room and these in public housing and uh,

50:10.280 --> 50:12.280
and they have their own

50:12.520 --> 50:20.200
They have their they won't let like police. Um, I mean, it's crazy. Uh, and I wish I had more solid anecdotal stuff, but they're uh

50:20.920 --> 50:22.920
Um, they're really rude

50:23.800 --> 50:27.240
Like if you ever have an interaction with them, they're really rude and they will not

50:27.240 --> 50:34.040
Uh, acknowledge you and if uh, you know, god forbid you're a woman and you're you hold the door open for them

50:34.200 --> 50:38.360
You know, like in a market or something that just won't even right and that's the big deal breaker

50:38.360 --> 50:44.040
It's like half the population is women women's rights is like that's the that's what they do their own woman is criminal

50:44.280 --> 50:50.920
Right, that shit is criminal and that's the that's that's I think going to be finally the the interesting thing about it is that women who

50:51.400 --> 50:56.600
Who we we freed slaves and let them vote before we before we finally somehow

50:56.600 --> 50:58.920
But grudgingly found it in ourselves to say that women could

50:59.400 --> 51:01.960
Well that I get if you watch any of the real housewives shows

51:02.600 --> 51:08.120
That's I mean there's there's a point that it's valid like um, and a lot of the slaves had dicks

51:08.120 --> 51:10.520
Which is where the voting power comes from so

51:11.240 --> 51:16.520
But it'll be amazing the fact that women are actually like kind of like this weird shield slash weapon that is the final

51:17.160 --> 51:20.840
Like decision maker in the battle. That's very difficult to have between

51:21.400 --> 51:23.240
um, look

51:23.240 --> 51:31.160
There's 8 billion of us now. Are we gonna are we gonna keep entertaining this notion that every single fucking conception

51:31.560 --> 51:36.440
Gets to have its own barbed wire fence around it protected by every goddamn thing

51:37.080 --> 51:43.160
If if you believe in this society that that if somebody's hitting their wife and no matter where they're living

51:43.480 --> 51:45.880
That you're that they're supposed to stop hitting their wife

51:45.960 --> 51:49.800
Then we we all agree that we have to like then there's certain freedoms

51:49.800 --> 51:56.600
That we have been protecting that may have to kind of erode under the problem is the the uh, the people you're talking about

51:56.840 --> 51:58.840
talking to the people that uh

51:59.400 --> 52:02.760
I mean, I don't probably not a lot of people in this room or listen to this podcast

52:02.840 --> 52:07.640
But most people in america and most people in other countries are religious and they have a different

52:07.880 --> 52:15.320
They have a different but equally kind of crazy notion. And so if they if anybody points to what is, uh,

52:16.120 --> 52:17.640
markedly

52:17.640 --> 52:22.280
Near criminal behavior from, uh, certain orthodox jews and sex

52:22.680 --> 52:28.040
Then the finger is going to be pointed to them and then it's a slippery slope. It dominoes down to and uh,

52:28.440 --> 52:30.600
And then do you think they're thinking that far ahead those people?

52:31.800 --> 52:35.560
Aren't those people the the ones you can really count on if I go to billy grams audience and go

52:35.640 --> 52:39.320
Hey, who wants to make laws against praying to a different god than yours?

52:39.400 --> 52:41.800
Don't you think they'd sign up immediately and then I could go gotcha

52:41.800 --> 52:47.560
Um, I don't know if they're are they like, whoa, stay your hand. Jebediah. It's the classic trap

52:49.240 --> 52:52.200
I think they're we love islam. Yeah, come on

52:53.960 --> 52:56.280
That was a lot of stereotypes I made on a whole like

52:59.000 --> 53:03.560
No, I think that uh, uh, you know, there there is

53:05.160 --> 53:09.000
There's the the if you said, hey, I've got this magic piece of paper

53:09.000 --> 53:12.280
If you sign this then this thing will happen and people will sign it happily

53:12.520 --> 53:18.840
But it just doesn't work that way and uh, I think you know, um, I mean, let's let's uh, yeah

53:18.840 --> 53:22.840
Let's go back to islam, which is obviously the much more uh, um

53:23.720 --> 53:25.720
Be very careful

53:27.640 --> 53:29.640
It's it's the more, uh

53:31.320 --> 53:33.320
It's the uh, it's the king of beers

53:34.280 --> 53:37.800
It's the it's the flashpoint, you know, it's the it's the easy one

53:37.800 --> 53:40.680
It's the easy one to uh, to uh

53:42.360 --> 53:45.720
Make fun of and and and ask questions about like like like yeah

53:45.800 --> 53:49.800
And look at the examine the line between what we perceive as women's rights human rights

53:50.440 --> 53:54.520
across the planet and and and like freedom of religion

53:54.840 --> 54:01.560
Yes, it makes the easy surf. I'm happy to say I have I have zero power, but I'm happy to say it's all wrong

54:01.640 --> 54:05.800
It's all bullshit. It all should be I mean certain behaviors should be outlawed as as

54:05.800 --> 54:09.960
Uh, you know, I think if it affects other people inside. Yeah, absolutely

54:10.040 --> 54:12.280
We got I mean someone has to like stand up and say

54:12.840 --> 54:18.840
We are a human planet now that the you know, like like when Jesus said render unto Caesar what is Caesar's like

54:18.840 --> 54:23.000
Like, you know, because they were trying to get him in like gotcha scenarios where they're like, well, you're gonna pay taxes bro

54:23.000 --> 54:27.640
Because if you are isn't that kind of like praying to Caesar and and he's like I if I'm interpreting this passage, right?

54:27.640 --> 54:29.640
He's like don't try to catch me in that shit

54:29.880 --> 54:33.960
You can be you can be a really holy person in your living room and like pay your taxes go ahead

54:33.960 --> 54:39.640
Like revolution is not going to happen because you like ran up the court steps and spit in someone's eye necessarily

54:39.640 --> 54:41.160
I'm not telling you not to do that either

54:41.160 --> 54:42.200
but like

54:42.200 --> 54:46.120
Caesar made the fucking money Caesar loves the money give Caesar his fucking money

54:46.440 --> 54:52.360
Like let's let's get back to talking about about this other shit. Um, the the like like that idea

54:53.080 --> 54:56.120
Extended to a now like like like we are

54:56.760 --> 54:59.960
I mean atheism wins like there is a like the

54:59.960 --> 55:03.240
The the like you you look into space and you

55:03.960 --> 55:11.800
Um, you you you you it's we need to continue to have a relationship with the fact that we're psychomonkeys that don't know what we're doing

55:11.800 --> 55:15.640
Right, but I want to I want to go back to something you said before I was even brought up here

55:15.640 --> 55:18.520
And you were talking about gay rights and you were talking about

55:20.360 --> 55:22.360
Why would

55:23.240 --> 55:25.000
Straight

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
homophobic men not

55:27.000 --> 55:31.320
allow gay marriage and and uh, I mean and if

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
By proxy just tolerate

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
homosexuals in society and

55:37.880 --> 55:41.960
I think the answer I don't know this isn't I've got no scientific

55:42.680 --> 55:44.680
basis in this but

55:45.080 --> 55:48.680
Those are people with some form of religious

55:49.720 --> 55:55.640
Training right that's what I was saying exactly. I don't think uh, I don't wear my atheism on my sleeve

55:55.640 --> 55:57.880
If I do a show like this, which I don't do that often

55:58.520 --> 56:04.120
I'll I'm happy to mention it if you get me uh in a in a bar or a pub and we've got a couple pints

56:04.120 --> 56:10.040
I'll fucking scream to the ratchets, but I don't I don't belong to an atheist society. I don't I'm not a spokesman. I

56:10.600 --> 56:11.960
firmly

56:11.960 --> 56:13.960
vehemently believe in my belief

56:15.880 --> 56:17.880
That's there's no belief dude

56:18.520 --> 56:21.160
You just fucked yourself with your words

56:21.160 --> 56:28.360
Um, but I imagine I imagine an orthodox jew saying that to you in that voice. Yeah

56:29.160 --> 56:32.520
He just converted. Yeah, and uh, he's in it to win it

56:32.680 --> 56:40.280
But no one of the things that makes me proud to be an atheist is I oddly enough to because those people can't understand it

56:40.360 --> 56:44.200
Is I am tolerant. I'm not tolerant of people who aren't intolerant

56:44.520 --> 56:47.880
But I am but I don't know of any atheists who go

56:47.880 --> 56:55.640
Oh, man fucking fags really weird me out. I don't I don't I think uh, I think gays should be shouldn't be allowed to marry

56:55.960 --> 57:01.400
I think uh, I think it's wrong. I think it goes against everything that's natural is like well

57:01.880 --> 57:03.880
Who taught you that who told you that?

57:04.200 --> 57:06.200
me

57:07.800 --> 57:09.480
You just don't

57:09.480 --> 57:15.400
Atheists don't do that. That's a really really I'm sure that point's been been been been pounded at me a lot

57:15.400 --> 57:19.080
But it just sunk in like that is a huge just very

57:19.800 --> 57:21.800
anecdotal but powerful example

57:22.120 --> 57:28.760
In favor of atheisms like like evangelism, which my pet peeve is is evangelical atheists

57:28.840 --> 57:32.680
Zealots who they don't I don't like them either. I don't they're not just defending me off

57:32.760 --> 57:35.640
Women from being abused under the guise of religion

57:35.720 --> 57:43.400
They're bothering to say and that's why if you're in kmart and you think that if you genuflect you might get a better lottery pick

57:43.400 --> 57:49.320
You're an asshole and should die. It's kind of like you don't need to let's let's clean up the clean up the living room

57:49.320 --> 57:50.840
One potted plant at a time

57:50.840 --> 57:53.560
I mean, I mean I agree with a lot of what you guys are saying

57:53.640 --> 57:57.720
But also like there's a lot of people who are very religious who are doing

57:58.280 --> 58:01.160
The right kinds of things and that they're not infringing on other people's rights

58:01.240 --> 58:06.600
And it's whatever whatever you believe that gets you through the day if you think it's a you know rubbing a stone in your armpit

58:06.680 --> 58:12.440
Will stop it from sweating and not give you Alzheimer's or that there's a god that's watching out for you

58:12.440 --> 58:16.120
Well, so there's so much human not you beautiful human mythology

58:16.520 --> 58:19.240
Arriving out of the core need for it

58:19.320 --> 58:24.200
Which is that when you become a conscious mammal before you have a microscope to tell you anything and by the way what you find

58:24.200 --> 58:26.120
Are the microscope ain't that heartening?

58:26.120 --> 58:31.480
But before you even have that it is a fucked up thing to realize as a mammal that you are alive and that you're gonna die

58:31.800 --> 58:35.880
And and six million years before well, okay, that's going back a little far

58:35.880 --> 58:43.240
Uh three million years before you get to be somewhat comforted by the fact that milk can be pasteurized

58:43.560 --> 58:50.200
Like you're you're alone in a dark world that basically on the fundamental level still to this day

58:50.840 --> 58:56.200
Fucks you up in the same way, which is like, uh, I'm like why I I start to love my my wife

58:56.280 --> 59:02.040
Like I was holding her hand in couples therapy and and the therapist was asking me what I think about when I hold her hand

59:02.040 --> 59:05.640
And I burst into tears and said I think about the fact that one of us is going to die

59:06.920 --> 59:11.880
And that's that's existence and that is something that we use mythology with which to to cope with

59:11.960 --> 59:14.200
Which is what we were talking about earlier today, right?

59:14.200 --> 59:19.800
You and I we were like nothing really means anything if you look at how insignificant we are in the universe

59:20.040 --> 59:21.960
Nothing we do means anything we lie to ourselves

59:21.960 --> 59:24.440
We tell us that we do podcasts and that's important and we make

59:24.840 --> 59:28.600
Movies and tv shows and that's how we get through the day and that's the lies

59:28.600 --> 59:33.080
We tell ourselves and then some people tell different lies as long as they don't infringe on my lies

59:33.160 --> 59:39.880
That's fine. And the and the and the and the cancer is the cancer comes in when it's when you say you're not allowed to say lies

59:40.200 --> 59:43.800
Right, you can't say that. What do you mean? It's a lie. That's that's where the problem starts

59:43.800 --> 59:49.560
So joseph gamble said like when religion loses its its transparency when it becomes opaque when you start looking at a stained glass window

59:49.560 --> 59:54.600
Like it's like a thing that has a use instead of just looking at it like this is a neat way to frame something

59:54.600 --> 59:59.800
We don't understand and couldn't otherwise see unless it was decorated with this fun fucking flimsy transparent shit

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:07.000
Like in this dance we do like when we when we start when we're when we're shooting people because we have because our religion has rules

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:10.520
That should be your first indication in my opinion that that is not a religion

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:14.280
You are not practicing a religion. You are practicing something much more real than religion

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.360
religion's bottle says

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.360
There should not be bullets involved

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:24.680
Because that's politics politics bottle says buy bullets it comes with bullets in the bottle

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:29.240
I think you're wrong. I wish that was true, but I think religion is bullets

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.720
I think religion has become bullets and

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:38.600
But maybe we could both be agree that politics is the one that exploits that aspect of religion and keeps it going

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:42.040
Whereas religion could be your lucky or power power maybe

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.120
Yeah

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.800
but yeah

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.240
But but religion is a and certainly can be

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.360
of violent

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.000
You know, what are you talking about? Give me one example

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.240
Of religion ever causing any violence

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.240
All right, well, uh, I want to thank

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:13.480
Let's uh, let's let's soften up this hard penis like conversation about open-mindedness

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:18.600
And the importance of our policy regarding religion with the soft

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:23.480
Intuitive influence of my wife's vagina. Please welcome

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.440
Erin McGathy

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.240
Can you feel it the vibrations of my vagina

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:44.680
Any any thoughts sweetie you you've been listening

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.960
Um, uh, I uh, I love it

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.400
I feel like you haven't been listening

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.400
I mean just the thing when he said the

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:05.960
I remember when I was first dating Aaron you brought we went back to my place and you you insisted on playing a 10 minute

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:10.680
Like david cross a bit about gold foil being used on desserts

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:17.480
And we just sat and listened to it like we were like like like listening to the grateful debt or something

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:22.440
And I think it was like a little test right like if I had gone. Oh, I don't know. Gold foil is pretty cool in desserts

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.640
like you would

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.640
You wouldn't you would have done

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:31.560
My dad is a is a bath Baptist minister and when I was in college I cleaned houses

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:37.560
And the thing that I listened to over and over again was shut up. You fucking baby. You're 2002

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.600
Which I wasn't gonna mention I was gonna be real cool

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:48.040
Um, but I I feel I feel very empowered by david cross's atheism and not

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:54.520
That like talent challenged by it in 2002. I was 18 years old 17 years old

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.800
I feel like an idiot, but I've never connected those dots. There is there. There are very

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.800
that like

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:08.360
Like 11 11 11 like atheism has has a has a harder work to do to connect to things like

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:14.360
Misogyny and homophobia. That's the hard thing is like religion. You have to buy and do all this crazy shit

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.960
All right, what do I get in return?

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:21.000
You get to go to heaven and it's rivers of milk and all the babes you can fuck and it's

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.640
That's the promise of religion, right?

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:29.960
Atheism is like this is all there is but we can have fun and it'll make sense and then you die and everything goes away

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:36.120
I feel very empowered by like I I wouldn't consider myself an atheist, but I feel very empowered by

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:44.440
Humanism and like the the way that you talk about atheism in that way the way that you approach it. It doesn't feel hateful

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.480
to me. Well, that's good. I uh,

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:53.880
I certainly I've certainly been accused of the opposite. I always feel like the most attractive thing about atheism is the fact

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.440
Is the same reason why I don't bother quite to uh to go all the way over to it

01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.960
Which is it's the edge of the pool

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.640
It is is the real thing that is there to hold you up and keep you from drowning and in the meantime

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.840
I'm like, I'm gonna try I'm gonna try to talk about it. I like the holidays

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.240
It's uh

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.000
People who try to convince you to be atheists are wrong

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:22.840
You either are or you weren't and you should be left alone to do and everybody should be left alone as long as you don't

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.480
impinge on their

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:29.960
their day-to-day week-to-week year-to-year life or your children and

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.600
That's why like you were saying I really can't stand those

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:40.600
proselytizing. Yeah, and uh, it's annoying. It's off-putting and you just you are a yarn

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.960
You you don't it's not like a big struggle and if it is

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:47.400
God bless you on your oh ironic on your um

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:51.400
On your journey, but you you the the the

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:56.840
I guess the credo of the atheist should just be simply to yourself

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.800
I don't need a book to tell me

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.360
The right way to treat people

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.840
What happens to your skin?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.760
Like when you say

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:11.800
You're atheist like to the world like what what happens? Well, I'm dark skin. I'm Jew

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.440
so

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.240
I used to be white then I became super atheist

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:27.000
And then this happened I will say I mean I won't say I'm atheist or not because

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:34.280
People would have a weird reaction to it and I want to be careful, but for me if you

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:38.120
If you do a thought experiment and you're like there's no religion

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:44.040
There's no it's atheism and then you look at the world from a purely atheist perspective

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:52.520
That is the world that makes the most sense to me like just scientifically from the things we understand and know

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:59.080
That's the version that seems to make the most sense except that the human eye is so complicated kidding

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.120
kidding

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:10.920
Right, you're saying that a windstorm could come through an airplane. What is the thing or

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.880
Airport no, it's a what's the the anti-atheist thing. It's a

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.080
Yeah, that that uh

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:23.160
Yeah, there's like a scattered graveyard of airport parts

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:29.560
In this story and oh god and then the idea that the wind would come and then it would just magically create this air

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:36.600
Well, but there's logic to try to prove what the thing is they go like how come when I open peanut butter, there's no ants in it

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.280
right

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:44.040
What who told you that would well the plane thing doesn't make sense because it's evolution so there were

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:49.720
Millions of other planes that didn't get made and they're just like I mean waiting on a seat

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.360
You can't tell us that we want you to know you don't have to

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:58.760
Like I'm like marveling at the like those guys are like look doesn't it seem like the banana was meant to fit in a hand?

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.600
Atheist wears nightmare

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.680
Yeah, they have videos like that

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:11.960
And there's a guy that like takes you through the banana the added irony by the way forget the fact that monkeys came after bananas

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:13.720
but

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:19.960
Um, just the added irony that the banana he's holding is the result of a post human genetic like uh

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:25.560
Experiment like there's no banana that ever looked like that before we invented fucking DNA manipulation

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.160
Look, it's a whole fruit. That's a handle. That means there's a god

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:36.360
And the extra irony is he keeps demonstrating how to eat the banana and how natural is so he just like it looks so I'm sure it's his nightmare

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.520
How gay he looks he's got this spray on tan and he's like I need to go like this

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:45.160
Isn't this great? Oh great. And then the the guy next to him's like, yeah, that's great. Ha those atheists are

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:49.880
Are really crying right now anything shaped like this is god's answer

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.080
Put it in your mouth

01:07:53.800 --> 01:08:01.080
And there's like I my favorite thing is when people get upset that when they get insulted at the notion

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:08.040
That of evolution when they're like, they're trying to um say that we came from monkeys. I didn't we didn't come

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.200
They're not saying like your dad

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:16.040
Fuck the monkey really. Yeah, why how come if you stay at the zoo long enough, you don't see a person all of a sudden going

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.040
Let me out of here. Yeah

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Why doesn't that ever happen? We've had zoos for 700 years. You know, I seriously watch playing into the apes backwards

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.400
That'll explain everything

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:35.480
There was this I read that the school had this creation science fair and the person who came in the first place put like glass jar

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:41.400
Put sand and rocks inside it and sealed it and a couple weeks later. Nothing. It evolves. So evolution disproved

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.960
But I thought it'd be so awesome if they pull it out and there's like a little giraffe in there

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:55.880
Oh, fuck. Well, the the crazy thing is that the scientific version of what we're talking about almost disturbing like operans hypothesis was like

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.600
like like didn't didn't operan like take a

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.240
tank full of like

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.240
primordial kind of like like

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.920
The shit that would exist in the in the beginning when and like

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:13.400
Put electric currents through it to simulate like lightning and and simulated like

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:21.000
The the real jar of peanut butter that would have a giraffe in it and the the actual scientific giraffe did like come out of nowhere

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.480
Is this the guy from the 20s though? Uh, yeah, I think

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.720
Wait, who's discredited though?

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.960
Because they couldn't find um

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:30.280
He lost all his uh

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:32.920
Uh, or he's a place caught on fire

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:37.880
Uh, one of his labs or something. That was the frog guy. I think I know you're that's what I'm thinking. Yeah

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.800
I wonder if that's the same guy. I really thought you said operas hypothesis

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.520
Welcome to my new science podcast. We should look this up later

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:53.560
If you're joining us you're on a device that gives you more information than we have

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.200
Well, we're just gonna talk about it

01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:01.400
But yeah, I thought yeah, I remember learning in high school operas hypothesis is locked in my head is like, holy shit

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:05.240
There's a certain kind of like a manner of shit. It wasn't like it wasn't like a giraffe

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:12.360
It wasn't even a cell or even a strand of RNA, but it was like an amino acid or a protein or something like spontaneously assembled itself

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:17.720
So it was like non-living to living is basically what you're saying is that what is no not non-living to living

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:22.120
But non-living to a building building block of future living's kind of stuff

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:27.880
Sure, sure, but but but but as David says because you should probably check in if you if the last science fact

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.640
You knew is from high school on your 42 years old. That's a lot

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.200
There's different number of planets in my solar system since when I went to high school

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.600
So David, I know you did you graciously got off a plane and came over here

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:43.240
So we don't want to keep you but is there any are there any?

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:48.920
I don't know like while you have the attention of hundreds and hundreds of people that love you

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:55.480
Uh anything else you need to plug or uh or say plant in their heads. I would not debase myself

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.240
After this

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:01.240
Heady intellectual discussion

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:06.280
I thought it was really nice. I I I hope you I hope you had a good enough time that you'd like to come back at some point

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.360
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, people here really

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:18.360
Thank you. All right, javid prash ladies and gentlemen

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.360
Dan I sat right next to him like a weirdo. I missed him

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:32.600
Remember when david was here? Yeah. Yeah, that was fun. Yeah

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.320
Are you are you taking a dig at me? No

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:41.080
Oh, wait, how am I taking a dig at you because you because he stepped off the stage and you immediately started missing him

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.160
I'm the only one left. I

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.520
know

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.480
Not a dig no now suddenly people understood

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:53.160
Now they think it's a dig. It was never a no no there what they started understanding is how fucked up. I am. Yes

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.720
They went whoa, that's a pretzel brain

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:01.480
I always think there's a video with that banana thing. That's yes. It's amazing

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.560
Whenever people are like, well, this is proof of a benevolent god. I'm always like, yeah

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:12.520
But there's also fucking tigers around, you know, those people fascinate me the most because it's like well, they're they're they have the

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.760
They have the easiest

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:19.720
Move in the magic deck, which is faith. I don't care and they don't use it

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:24.040
They choose the logic path to be a christian and what are you doing?

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.000
Why are you playing basketball in skis?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Yeah, my dad my dad who's a who I said earlier is a Baptist minister after sermons

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Sometimes I would see people come up to him the same way that someone would come up to

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.800
Come on Aaron. Who's one person who is in Star Trek?

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.440
God damn it Aaron. Who is one actor whoopee Goldberg?

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:50.440
Cratal robber

01:12:50.440 --> 01:13:00.440
Wait, why didn't you want to say a Star Trek person because because it's analogous to people who come up to

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:07.880
Actors and in Star Trek and say like hey like I was just thinking about it and and this could actually happen because I did the math and

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.440
You guys got to this planet at this certain speed

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:16.120
And in the same way to my dad after sermons a guy would be like yeah, I took all the bees out of

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:23.240
Genesis and I added them together and that number is the same number of days that no one had no I had lunch

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.560
with Sarah and

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:32.280
So like this stuff is totally real and I might I would be like, all right. Well, yeah, you can find patterns wherever

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:37.400
And that's what I love about your dad. I know if I told like one of the tail when I was like, okay

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:42.440
This is my father-in-law. I'm gonna. I just have I just have to marry his daughter still

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:48.840
Uh, when you when you told me about how he was like he's a navy chaplain, but like one of his

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.560
Uh navy crewman seaman

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.600
Crewman seaman

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:58.200
I don't want to call someone a seaman unless I absolutely know that I'm supposed to

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.320
They call him the jizz boys

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:04.840
One of his jizz boys

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:10.760
His jizz boys that's what my dad said is that one of one of the guys one of the guys within his flock was a

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:16.920
Scientologist and so he had a stat he went out and bought Scientology books. He's a he's a Baptist

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.920
Uh, uh preacher. He he's he's fine with gay marriage

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.240
He he has to go up against his own congregation sometimes in the powers that be above him

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:29.720
But in addition to that he's like he's he knows that his role is to like like these are

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:35.800
These are soldiers and they're in a time of crisis no matter what and like like my job is to like

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.160
You know

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:41.800
Be there for any kind of like emergency. I need spiritually and like he read

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:50.360
Scientology books so that in a pinch if somebody that is the one Scientologist aboard got his pinky stuck in a in a canon door

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.760
He'd be like, oh

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.760
Mixo plicks, please help me

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.240
And your dad would be like, I know what he means

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:58.600
Yeah

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.600
Mixo plicks

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.880
Yeah, my dad also carries a wand

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:08.280
Uh, some of you Scientologists in the audience may have been offended by my

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.960
depiction of your religion

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.800
Uh

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.480
Okay, so well, yeah, I mean we're we're we're on a we're on a bullet train here. We gotta

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:23.000
Should we bring out? Yeah, we gotta we gotta bring out the boys. Uh, let's bring out the boys. Let's bring out the jizz boys

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:30.280
The jizz boys, let's we're gonna bring out uh game master spencer crittenden

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:47.400
And uh, he was with us last time when we're creating our characters that he's still here. I'm assuming he's coming up DeMorge Brown

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:53.400
Down town DeMorge Brown we call him

01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:00.280
Because there's another DeMorge Brown who uh, does like

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.520
So downtown DeMorge Brown is the vj version

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:08.120
Doing references from 1982

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:14.840
You will get them if you go home and ask your parents for the vcr in their floorboards

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.840
When I was a kid

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.560
There was a kid a kid named Wesley brown who was bigger than I was and had a bald head

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:28.040
And glasses and he used to say downtown DeMorge Brown every time I came in the room

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:32.840
That sounds like an oracle. There was a difference. You liked that though, right? Like that sounds nice

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:37.960
He did that to everybody. He was like a like a basketball announcer sort of uh, but he didn't well, okay

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:42.680
All right. Yeah, I guess that that that that that uh, I enjoy the lies the illusion

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:46.200
I think downtown julie brown missing for a while

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:52.280
But they found her in the uh least likely of places. Yeah uptown

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:05.080
It's the story everyone's talking about a celebrity disappears with a nomenclature old twist

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:17.640
Um, yes downtown julie brown, um, I wonder how that works. Remember julie. Does anybody just remember remember julie brown the non downtown julie brown?

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:21.240
Yeah, she just did a comedy show in los filos a couple weeks ago

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.440
In the character of julie brown

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:30.840
Which I was very confused by because I thought that was her but she said I'm doing a show in the character of julie brown

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:33.960
Did she like write earth girls are easy or would she just in it?

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:36.520
I don't know. She was very creatively active

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:43.400
Back before there was an internet to be like kind of fringy, but also funny as she was she was a hero to some people

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:47.320
Uh, should have her on the show talk to her about about about

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.560
Looking at jeff gold blooms. Like do you ever see do you ever see earth girls are easy?

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.960
I've seen the cover of the tape. I watched the last christmas. All right

01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:01.320
So was whippy goldberg in it because she's the only I know someone just said no. Thank you

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.320
So

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:08.360
Can you follow me around in my life so I can pick up a shoe and I'd be like lunch and you'd be like no, that's not lunch

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.440
Aaron

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.600
Damon Wayans is in it though, right?

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:19.240
Isn't Damon Wayans. Yes. Yes. Damon Wayans jim carrey and jeff goldbloom and it's half of aliens that come that are like like

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:24.360
hairy furry alien people that descend on the valley and oh my god

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.200
The only earthlings that they meet are like these valley girls

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:33.400
Which was like a thing and then they shave them and they're like, oh my god, you're totally hot underneath all that fur

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.320
What did they shave on them?

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:39.080
Their bodies they have like red and yellow or even they shave the girls

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:42.920
No, no, no god. No the girls don't have fur all over them

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:47.640
The the aliens do and they shave them and they look like the girls do have fur all over them

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:51.160
But they've been conditioned by society to take care of that before it becomes the aliens problem

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:56.760
When they're fat like jim carrey's great, they're different colors. Yeah, they're like

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:04.440
Different teletubbies almost like these live bodies. It's a it's a it's a it's an interesting movie in a world where uh, yeah

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:05.720
like

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:07.720
Yeah, I don't know kids should watch it

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.520
Zardaz hudson hawk

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.400
Watch watch watch movies that kind of

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:18.840
You know, what is it? I is the title ironic earth girls not actually easy

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.880
I don't know they were in that movie. They were easy

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:25.800
Huh, I think I think the title obviously just bridges

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:31.560
At the time an ironic coupling which is sci-fi with sexual sounds like a movie that was written after somebody said

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.720
We should have a movie called earth girls are easy

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.440
I think it might have been based on a julie brown novelty song, frankly

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:44.600
I don't know if she made that because she was yeah, look it up google it again. Thank you. Thank you for coming to pop culture

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.560
We'll look it up later

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.960
Spencer is here. Yeah

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.960
Yeah

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.040
Thanks audience I needed that

01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:02.120
So I got a weird anecdote. I got a share. Okay, so I hang out with my friend matt landsman

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:07.640
He's a friend of mine and I've I've had the convention of when I enter the room

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.720
I have a wireless jam box speaker

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:17.160
When I when I enter the room I I play I play the john sena theme song right as I open the door

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:21.640
I I hope you guys know the theme song anyway the the other night

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:25.400
I was at my friend matt's house and his roommate was just coming home and

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:31.320
And I didn't have the song quite queued up and we all realized what had to happen

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.800
I had to get the song queued up before he got in the house

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.960
And no one knew how that was going to happen

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:39.080
So I was like lock the door and my friend runs and does that chain

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:42.040
You know the chain where you yeah locks the door like that

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:45.400
And I'm queuing up the song. I got it. It starts playing

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:51.080
You know it takes about six seconds to really kick in and like as right as the guy is going up

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:57.400
Part like the the roommate literally kicks the in the door

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.320
And enters the room right as john sena is like

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.440
It was amazing and horrifying

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:12.040
That's the culmination of that whole

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:18.440
You can never play that song. I know it's it's ruined now. Yeah to destroy property to play the song

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:24.440
That story requires familiarity with that song for sure. Yeah, I wish I kind of wanted to lock on

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:27.000
Otherwise it's just a story that your friend came home and kicked in the door

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:33.560
Yeah, you need to know the song, but I feel confident that most everyone has heard that song before so

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:39.160
Well, I I don't know the song, but I really got the story. I was there with you

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:46.440
Well, I was you got to listen to the song man john sena theme song on google third video result down

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:55.560
I know how to get it if I pop if I type j o into uh into google it says john sena theme song

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.880
I think that's just you Spencer. Oh, no, I know it's that's what I'm saying. It's I do that so often

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:07.800
It's it's two letters for me. I have to I have to tell this story now because it just I'll never I'll never remember it

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:15.960
And I just remembered it the I I had a girl over to my apartment like like when I back in my horrible flawed bachelor days

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:19.720
Very small two bedroom apartment

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:26.520
Los feliz and for some reason we were you know, we had been on like a couple dates and I I guess this is

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:30.920
You're gonna find out that I'm a bad third date, but we were gonna watch 2001

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:34.920
um

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:43.320
Whatever we ate or whatever was happening to me as I this is a small apartment and like the bathroom is right next to the living room

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:49.160
And the door is thin and it was like like there's just no I hadn't hadn't made those calculations

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:56.280
It was like I like this girl. We're watching 2001. Oh gurgle gurgle. I gotta go do something that I can tell already

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.440
It's gonna have acoustic

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:08.360
Attributes to it. So I go in the bathroom and I swear to God even though it seems like a really dumb sit-com pitch or like like not even

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:13.160
Because it looks like like I but I like I'm listening to her watching 2001

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:16.280
Because I didn't want to pause it because I didn't want silence while I did this

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Yeah, I'm listening to it and I'm turned the volume up because then she knows so my only choice is I'm waiting

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.800
for the spake there Sarah thruster

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:30.440
To crescendo. Yeah, that's my plan

01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:38.600
But like and I I know it sounds fake. It sounds like I'm a spaulding grain. I'm like

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:42.200
Like like like does not sound like you're spawning gray

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:50.440
I I mean like a spaulding gray like uh, no, I know. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you guys. Can you give us a minute?

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:58.040
Baby, baby, you're no you're spaulding gray. No, you're gonna die on the stage. Don't worry. Leave it alone. You're good

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:01.160
You know, it's been my life being a joke. I'm gonna be a joke with you, too

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:05.720
Anyways, we're back and so later

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:11.640
Mr. Recipe is gonna come out and show you a strudel that will

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.160
Shit your pants off

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:24.200
So I I was I was I was on the toilet trying to look wait for the this calm serene

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:26.680
epic

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:33.880
Investigation of the human condition to reach its point in the overture when the timpani drums covered my fucking

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.920
And it didn't it worked the exact opposite

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:43.160
Because I was like prepping it and then I framed it and I swear what happened was just like drums going boom boom

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.160
Boom

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:50.360
Like it was like the song was like I was doing it with the song. It was framed by it

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:55.240
And I and I just after a point was just like just get it out

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:59.080
Stop it because everything you're doing to try to your daffy duck now

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:05.720
Everything you do is like making you knot bucks bunny. Just flush it and just finish it. Just just just just see how this goes

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:11.320
And and I just and I came out and I and I went and I went I went like

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:13.320
Say sorry about that

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:21.400
And she was like like like

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:27.800
It's like about what but like like also like the look on her face was like kind of like now that I look back on and I'm like

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.240
She was saying about what as if to say don't talk about your shit

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:36.760
After making me listen to it. Well, that's that's that's her problem. Well, I don't know

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:41.800
She was she was like about what and then I was like well about the noisy shit I took and I kind of

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:44.120
And she's like I didn't hear it

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:47.080
She's like stop stop third date third date

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.480
Uh, all right, so word for word spaulding gray's final performance

01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:58.440
I gotta look up spaulding gray

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.440
I

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.680
Feel weird and also like

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:12.360
David I went my whole thing was in fealty to David

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:17.400
I wanted to like let him go because I didn't want to hold him up, but he went he went backstage and he's watching the show

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.240
And now I feel like

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:29.240
Bring him back out bring him back out

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:40.040
Oh, that's wow. All right, we'll understand if you leave very quickly after your hardcore

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:45.880
I don't know. I'm happy uh, uh, were you letting me go just uh

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:51.000
Because well, I have this awkward thing where I um, I'm not a self-loathing nerd

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.440
But I've had enough guests where toward the end of the show. I've had to explain to them

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:57.320
We're about to do something you might not understand

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:04.920
Because around this hour we we go into a role-playing game and we're starting a new one tonight and uh, I don't I never know

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.480
First of all what how prepared Spencer is to throw

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:12.760
Uh new random people into something and I also never know how the people feel about it

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.520
And so I well, we're not doing the adventure today, right? We're just introducing the character

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:21.880
Well, you know, I I thought that we told the audience we'd play. Um, so I there's

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:28.680
No one knows shadow run. There's this thing in shadow run. That's like a quick start rules guide that comes shadow run. Yeah

01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:36.280
Yeah, the guys the guys right here dan your instinct was correct

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:47.240
David have you ever played any role-playing games? Um, like that kind of thing no

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:51.800
But like it's kind of like if lord of the rings was oh

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.800
Fuck

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:59.880
Would you have you ever heard the word shadow run before? No

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:07.640
Lake 70 song by uh, lily joe and the fish

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.360
Baby you make my shadow run

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:23.480
Oh, can you go on and explain what that would mean like if someone was to make your shadow run

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:30.520
It's your it's your spirit your soul. You're uh, you're the idea of who and what you are what you stand for what you believe

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.920
um, but you but

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.760
It's inside you, but then you're going to the forest for this whole other reason

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:41.320
There's a whole backstory and you're you're going to the edge of the forest and then

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:45.160
Uh, you get scared, but not it's a it's a switch

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:46.760
um

01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.320
Because you ate a funny cake and you're

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:56.520
So your body the body would normally be scared, but your essence would not be scared would stand up and fight

01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:58.840
but in this switcheroo

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:00.360
uh

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.360
because the uh, the

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:08.040
The warlock of glen bore falls and you've already gone through the valley of tears

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:13.000
So you go so now you're at the of course and that so your essence gets scared and then it runs through

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.600
And shadow is just a shortcut

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:21.800
Turn for for everything. Yeah, I thought it was like you you you make me want to be a better person

01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:23.800
You make the dark parts of me flee

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:29.800
I mean, you know, it's interesting. I I had your explanation to think about mine

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:41.400
I thought it meant that like in a relationship you lose yourself. So you make your shadow run. You don't see yourself anymore. You just like

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:49.240
You're absorbed. Oh, you lose the self in a way that that's selfless. Wow this wait, what do you mean? Wait, I didn't get that

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.040
shadow run

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:59.080
Well, you see your shadow you see you see yourself you see your reflection of yourself you make my shadow run

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:04.200
I like what you are so much and I am at such a deficit as a person that you make my shadow run

01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:09.480
I'm just you now. I am going to be absorbed. Oh, I thought it's a more positive thing in that you're not

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:13.800
You're not obsessed with yourself and the way you were before now

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.800
There's someone else that you care for

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:22.280
And so you're not just self-reflexive all right. You're okay. No, wait a second. That's a better way to look at

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:27.000
I thought I mean obviously you've been joking around

01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:35.800
I thought it's it's from uh from 12 o'clock in the afternoon until just about five o'clock

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:44.440
During the spring and fall and then uh, but time it time goes quicker. So your shadow actually a long

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.320
Time goes by like a long time with you

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:53.400
You made my shadow run. Oh, that's beautiful. That's beautiful

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:58.040
Yeah, I just saw an older guy who looked a lot like my dad and wore blue jeans and

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:04.920
Would walk along the roadside at like one o'clock in the morning singing to himself. That one's wrong. That one's wrong

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.800
The exception that proves the rule classic dad

01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:16.920
I know that the I think I think I think what this song has going for it is that sun rhymes with run

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:19.960
And the sun makes a shadow go away

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:24.200
I like the sundial theory, which is what I'm calling david's

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:27.800
I think the sun makes the shadow show up. I don't

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.520
No, no, no, no, no

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:38.200
At 12 noon, there's no shadow because the sun is I tried to block myself from everything in your sun

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:40.600
But in the end

01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:42.600
baby, you make my shadow

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:46.040
all right like

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.840
Like it you you you move through the sky and the

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:52.200
Like you no matter I no matter how hard I try

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.840
You move through the sky

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:57.160
And and make my darkness come undone

01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:00.440
You make my shadow look you make my shadow

01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:04.200
From nine to five. I got a plier in my hand and I

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:12.440
What is that job? That's just blue collar flavor like a little a little fun fun fact is uh

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:18.360
Uh, he recorded that he recorded that with over 30. I think it was 32 different tools

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:30.680
Huey Lewis's song when he's like milwaukey like yeah, the hard-o rock and roll seattle

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:36.200
Well, honey, that's our city. I didn't even know we were fans of this guy

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.640
How do you do that? Is he in our radio?

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:41.640
I

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:48.120
I have that shadow wrongs run song stuck in my head now for real

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:54.680
I block your light, but when the day is done

01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:59.160
Baby you make my shadow

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.880
My shadow

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:12.120
That's a duet from the tv movie, but in the morning the light comes again

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:16.120
All right, so

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.640
So you do know what shadow run is

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:29.640
I was just gonna say that's gonna make everything a lot easier now. We are all on the same page

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:31.640
I

01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:38.440
I was so hoping you were just stewing there. You're like this is a serious thing and you're about to snap

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:41.960
That is not what shadow run is guys

01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:46.280
Somebody worked hard on this

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.320
I mean

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.800
Not even in a joke in all seriousness

01:33:53.800 --> 01:34:00.840
I've encountered like seven of those kinds of shadow run enthusiasts already and I'm getting kind of sick of that so

01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:04.920
People who are like two and do it. Yeah, I'm gonna lean in that other direction

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:08.920
I mean when you're talking about fairies and shit, you can't take yourself seriously

01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.120
That's what the irish do

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.640
Look what it got him

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:23.240
That brings the whole theme into it both gay rights and religious

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:28.600
Transparency. Yeah, it's like well, don't cry. I'm not archie bunker. I'm just saying like

01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:34.280
Like like like yeah, if you take anything too seriously, you lose you lose your shadow

01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:40.520
I thought when he like irish fairies you were trying to connect those two

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:42.040
Yeah

01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:47.880
Like what if what if yeah, what if the irish believed in fairies so much that they that when they when you flew air lingus

01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:50.200
If an irish guy got on the plane, he was like, I'm sorry

01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.160
That person's got salt on their shoe

01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:57.800
We wouldn't tolerate it from them

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:02.040
Air lingus sounds really sexual it does. Yeah

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:04.040
Yeah

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:06.040
That joy of that

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:11.000
But there's no fairies in shadow run world, right? It's like a cyberpunk

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.240
No, I mean there's orcs and elves and shit. I don't think there's fairies necessarily. Yeah, come on man

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:18.360
There are no fairies

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:21.800
But it's like technology base. I did read the elves

01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:26.280
Contract the one of those viruses they could turn into a banshee and I know that a banshee is a

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
fairy. Yep

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:32.680
Shit yeah marveling I

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.280
I will I will take that sound at face value. You are marveling at me

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:40.920
As people don't laugh when evil can evil makes a landing like

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:43.640
I know that sound was

01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:45.480
You were breathless

01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:54.440
Shadowrunner is like dnd if trolls had pink mohawks and spray paint and ipad spray paint the the hallmark of technology

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:02.280
But but yes

01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:07.000
That's true though. Yeah aliens are gonna come and be like these guys and oh they have spray paint cannons

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.720
Leave them alone

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:15.320
Your paint ain't confined to just a can and a brush it's in the air

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:21.880
What air doesn't rhyme with shadow run

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.400
It's not going to no matter how long we wait

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:34.440
So what what is uh shout you everyone's familiar with no, I don't I don't think anyone's familiar with it

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:39.720
It's a it's a role-playing game in which like collectively we tell a story together

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:44.760
Where these guys play as characters. I know that's your justification for playing it. So what is

01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:48.280
Oh, no

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.800
That one cut a little deep

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:55.640
Uh, yeah, you don't get rid of the rumble

01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:00.760
It's it's uh, but it's like uh

01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:02.840
It's like uh

01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:08.280
Dungeons and dragons where there's a there's a it's a story but the the context is different, but it's the same

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:14.440
It's a different world. It's not as sort of sorcery. It's more technology and magic in the future

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:20.680
Laser is and spray paint. Yeah, it's like a dystopian earth. So technology is like where uh, and I'm

01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:21.640
I'm

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:23.240
Literally, I'm not trying to be funny

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:28.840
But no where the where you'd have a spell that would do a certain thing now you have technology that does a certain thing

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:32.680
Well, it's actually both so you got like you got your guys who cast magic

01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:36.600
But then you also have guys who you know just have guns and robot parts that

01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:38.920
Wow

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:42.920
David David David you said you weren't

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:47.640
Too much

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:54.520
And hacking it's a lot to digest. I think he's got he's got a good grasp on it. It's it's it's uh, it's it's it's uh,

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:57.080
if like uh

01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:04.440
William Gibson's future, uh, or blade runner like if the in the midst of blade runner then someone said, ah, there's elves now

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.200
It's dystopian hobbit. It's a mishmash

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:14.600
Yeah, no, that's a good way of putting it. It's just distilled. It is just like blade runner except also magic

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.160
It seems like it seems like lazy writing. Okay

01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:25.240
Yeah, it's how you get around like how are they gonna be out of magic so they can do whatever the fuck they want

01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:29.960
It's like the giant eagles and the hobbit. Anyway, uh, we don't have to get into it

01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:35.000
Are you are you a d&d guy? Uh, I don't really know it. I just know it from playing here

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000
I love like fantasy stuff. But do you like sci-fi stuff? Do you like like blade runner and shit like that?

01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.600
I like blade runner, uh, I don't I don't

01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:44.200
don't some science fiction stuff

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:50.120
I I do but as as a I'm not drawn to the genre like other people are you only like the best examples of it probably

01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:54.040
Just good. Yeah. Yeah, good I'm fine with good

01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:58.440
There just isn't a lot of good

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:04.360
And since the first the first edition of chat around was introduced in 1987. Is that right?

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.480
I think yeah

01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:11.000
For a while, but they there were now in the fifth edition

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Yeah, meanwhile, we can't get somebody to take another pass at the Quran.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000
We've got...

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I should stop saying that.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Before it becomes your catchphrase.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000
It won't be it for very long.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
I'll get heptode.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
What?

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000
I can say it.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.000
He's right. He didn't make the rules.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000
He's just riding him across the finish line.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.000
So, yeah, I mean,

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000
originally we were going to present characters,

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
you know, even if, you know,

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000
that might take the whole time we have left.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
But let's present the characters, right?

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.000
So, I could pass these out.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I'll do that. Make funnies.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Shadow.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Do you make the characters or are the characters part of the game?

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000
We consulted with him because it's a new game with a new milieu.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
So we talked last episode about the kinds of characters we'd like to play.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
And so there's been a sort of interplay between Spencer doing, arguably,

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:30.000
probably the hardest, most joyless work of, like, rolling our characters.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Yeah, but the guys like that love that shit.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
I hate it.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
I love it.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.000
I really, it took me about a combined 16 hours for all of these.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000
It was, it was not...

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Yeah, you got something to do. Great.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
All right.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
That's true, though.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
I was actually at work not doing anything during those 16 hours.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
But you love doing it. You get joy from it, right?

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
This isn't a war.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.000
I mean, there's, joy happens at some point in the equation.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Sure, there's joy.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
I mean, there was joy.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000
So, David, what it is, is there'll be, like, different races you can choose from, like, or...

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
It's a pencil, Dan.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Or, like, wizards or hackers or whatever it is, so we all...

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Yeah, I made, you know, folders for everyone.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.000
There's a lot of bullets in this game, so you really need to be marking your own inventory and shit.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000
I would say the thread that the pencil is attached to is really above and beyond.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Yeah.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
That's because you guys are going to lose them.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
I feel like I'm at a bank.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000
I mean...

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I don't want to lose these things.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
No, thank you.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
You take them home otherwise or something. I don't know.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
No, this is...

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I can't just buy pencils every day.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
That's great, so let's talk about these guys.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Yeah, let's...

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
So I, can we start with my guy?

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Yeah, do you know about your guy?

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
I actually sent you an email about him. I don't know if you read it.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Oh, yeah, I...

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000
I read mine.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Yeah.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000
No, so assume I didn't read it.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Okay, well, I'll just pull up this email I sent you.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
All right.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
What email address did you send it to? Do not say that.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:28.000
It's karanreboot at AOL.com.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000
All right, well, all read...

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:39.000
It's your new gimmick. You're the Yakov Smirnov of...

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000
I'm really pushing for the rewrite of the Koran.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
That's my stance.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.000
So if you haven't read yours, let's not start with yours.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Let's start with Dan or something.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Dan or something?

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
And then I could do it.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I could read it, but not the first one.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Let Dan start off.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Wait, you want me to...

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Tell us about your character.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Don't read your sheet. It's about your background and stuff.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Okay, yeah, well, I just want to ask this.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
My character, it feels like he's...

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000
I don't know how much stuff the other people should know,

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
but do you think I should just let it all out?

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Yeah, I mean, let it all out.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
They're skilled professionals.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
I think if anything you say that's secret,

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
they can pretend it's secret.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Okay, so my character was born James Gundram III

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:39.000
in Wisconsin in 2034.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:46.000
And his dad was a prominent member

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.000
of the anti-meta-human hate group.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Humanitous...

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Humanus populi, I think.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
What was it?

01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Populi?

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.000
They're kind of a Ku Klux Klan of when people started

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:06.000
turning into elves and stuff.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
There was a human...

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
But the uplifting thing is that black people

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
could be in this group and hate goblins.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000
It was great.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000
It's just when you think you're going to achieve everything

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000
that's like...

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
It's a whole new way to hate people.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.000
So my dad was like a founding member,

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.000
kind of a thug, an arsonist assassin within that group.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.000
And he taught me how to fight and how to be scrappy,

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
but also I was smart and I could talk

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
so they thought let's send him to the academy

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
to be a lone star officer.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
A lone star is sort of a police force

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000
that services a lot of the city-states in the future.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Maybe he could eventually be a politician or something

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
and he could make our horrible racist cause

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
like a law.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Put it into legislation.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
And then I went to school and I fell in love

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.000
with an elf girl.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.000
And then I begged my dad to reconsider his ways,

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
but he couldn't.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
And as I was attempting to flee the state with her,

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000
she was killed under mysterious circumstances.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
And I blamed my father for it

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.000
and signed on with the lone star security services

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000
under the condition that my dad would be among those put away

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
when I infiltrated this horrible hate group.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
And so I did all that.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000
And then because I needed my identity wiped

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
because I betrayed everybody I knew at that job,

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
then I just became this horrible,

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000
like the government just used me and sent me to every city

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
and made me change my name every time

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
and taught me how to do that.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000
And I would just narc on and like shadow runners

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000
like in every city.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.000
And then I found out my dad didn't actually kill my girlfriend.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Like I think actually the cops did to make me available

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
for that employment opportunity.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Cause you're such a good cop.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Well, cause they were like,

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.000
boy, this guy's going to be amazing if we just kill his girlfriend.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Give him the right motivation.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
His family is so racist.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000
He'll think this is a fucking, this is not a seven 10 split.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
I don't know what the opposite of that is.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Remember, I'm from Wisconsin.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Okay, so it's all bowling analogies.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Yeah.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
I like it.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
So then I was betrayed by the people that owned me

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
and like they used me to do shitty stuff.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
I was like a narc and I believed in it

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000
and now I don't believe in it.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
And so I had to escape with my life

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000
cause they were going to kill me.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:32.000
And I used the most, the only identity I had that no one knew about

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000
which was a generic identity pulled from like a textbook in the academy.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
So my name is Jim Nightblade.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:47.000
A former cop trapped in the life of the crime he used to fight.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
That's a pitch.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Motherfucker, everything I do is a pitch.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.000
What if this microphone had to hang out with an anti-phone?

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Okay, great. Aaron.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
I don't know why I affected an urban dialect.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Yeah, I don't know.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Anti-phone?

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.000
I found that email Spencer, it reminds me of going to my spam.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.000
But I have it and I can read it, but you guys go first.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Spencer, you came up with all the stuff, right?

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
No, he came up with his, Aaron came up with her backstory

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.000
and then I came up with DeMorge and Coomale's backstory because, yeah.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Not nerds.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000
This is fascinating.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:43.000
I can't, I've never seen anything from this side where you're telling the story

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
and people are like, oh.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Like the thing where when you said he, and I found out my dad didn't kill my girl.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.000
No, when you said that my dad killed my girlfriend, there were people here who were like, oh.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Yeah, but you've seen, that's just the power of like an audience's grace when they're like,

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
oh, we trust you and know you like, you, you listen.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000
That was, no, that was honest, that wasn't, there was nothing.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000
When you listen to Prairie Home Companion, like Gears and Keeler goes like,

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:16.000
and then the blueberry pie, paddle, boop-a-doop-a-doo, and everyone goes like, ah.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Joe went fishing for the first time in six months.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000
It's called Stockholm Syndrome.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000
If I don't like my coffee this morning, Munich's gonna go bad.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Okay.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Out to your Ubers.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
If we're not gonna have a sh-

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Out to your Ubers.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Out to your Ubers.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Alright, so my character is named Mercy O'Donnell,

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:47.000
and I'll just read the short email that I sent Spencer earlier today.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
It's a historical hostage event.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Well within my right to use that to illustrate.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Sorry.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Made a movie about it for kids.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Yeah, Munich was for kids.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Alright, this is Mercy O'Donnell.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Former publicist for Ares Macro Technology, an ex-wife of its CEO, Damian Knight,

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Mercy O'Donnell is a madam for megacorporations and the underground alike.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Two years ago, Mercy left her husband after he beat their teenage son to death in an argument.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:33.000
When she fled, when she fled Ares Macro Technology manipulated evidence at the scene,

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:40.000
and the corporate court charged Mercy with a murder as a madam, Mercy, so she's on the run.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:47.000
As a madam, Mercy works almost exclusively with magic users who may or may not procure payment

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:53.000
without quote-unquote natural sexual services rendered, regardless her Johns always leave happy.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:59.000
With a name that is always changing, she is known by her many contacts as the eyes,

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.000
because I have the best face ever, is the thing that was established before.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
I'm looking at David.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000
And you're a hooker.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
You're a prostitute?

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Uh, no.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:15.000
No, I'm a madam, but I work mostly with magic users.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
I work mostly with people who are able-

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
What does madam mean?

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.000
What is a madam?

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Like a prostitute king?

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Oh, yeah, like a prostitute king.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.000
King of all the prostitutes, that's true.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:38.000
The first conversation between the worst representatives of an indigenous and an invading population.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
That's their tatanka.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000
In a way.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000
How do whores work?

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
You need a king of whores?

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Yes.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Yeah, so I'm working as a madam, but that's my cover.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.000
But Camille, a madam is somebody who's like an agent for prostitutes.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000
It's like CAA for prostitutes.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Oh, you're the CAA of prostitutes?

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.000
I thought CAA was the CAA of prostitutes.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:18.000
You know in the movies when you run into a brothel, and then there's like, there's all of the sad, broken-hearted, carnival-

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
There's a woman who's just turned 35.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Yeah, there's the milf who's eight years younger than me.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:29.000
But I am more a madam as a cover.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:37.000
I don't know how much I should say about my character, but she's fiercely anti-male.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
And the way that that's...

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Shocker.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Well, why is that? What?

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000
I mean, you're just saying that. That doesn't mean anything.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:49.000
You can say shocker after almost anything. Try it tonight, kids, as you go home.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
It's a button.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Maybe because she watched her husband, whom she loved when they got married, kill her son.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
So she has like an imbalanced hatred.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:07.000
But the son is also male, so why is she a male hater?

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Well, I mean, sometimes hatred doesn't make sense.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Right.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:18.000
She's afraid of men, and now she's wanting to protect women.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.000
But God, she has this face.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
She's got a great face.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000
She has a great face, but it's not for you.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
What do you mean? Why is it not for me?

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.000
I don't know. I'm spiraling. It's not for men.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
If I can afford it, it's for me, right?

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.000
No, because I am the agent.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Sorry, right.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000
I am the agent.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000
You're the agent.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:46.000
But the idea is that she is making her money by employing magic-using prostitutes,

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.000
her convincing men that they're getting off, and they're not really.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Oh.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Okay, got it, got it, got it, got it.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:56.000
But maybe not exclusively.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Being convinced that you got off is identical.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000
You're getting off.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000
I wouldn't even have a complaint.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Well, this is interesting.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:09.000
It's different in that the girl doesn't have to put a orc dick in her mouth.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Oh, that's great for her.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.000
That's like when the hotel says, we turn your lights off because the planet needs to be saved.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Fine for you.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:22.000
I'm saying as a male customer, if you told me, listen, sorry, if you're out of...

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000
No, exactly.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000
I wouldn't demand my money back.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
No, I know.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
I thought I got the best blow job ever.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Well, that's a thing.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Except I think egos would get in the way where guys would be like,

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.000
I thought the best girl last night is almost like you didn't actually.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000
That's the perfect scene to introduce your character in the movie version,

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
where there's a guy that's like that.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Because then you can demonstrate how you lay down the law to protect these ladies.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Right.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
That's what I like about the archetype of the hooker matron,

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000
who's in a world where the government doesn't care about humanity.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.000
There's a woman who's like a den mother to these lost souls.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Yeah, I'm like a mother hen, but young.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000
And a great face.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
And hotter than all of them.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Hotter than all of them.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000
It's like...

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Yeah, okay.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Got it.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:14.000
So, DeMores, I don't know if you want to talk through, but I also have the write-up that I sent you,

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
so I can read that or you could do it.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Just to caution the audience.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Yeah, I know the characters.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Just because of the bills we have to pay.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:27.000
DeMores' character is basically the noid from Pizza Hut.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.000
It's called branded content.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000
There's no commercials during the podcast.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000
No, no.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.000
But Pizza Hut tastes so good that we're okay.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000
And it's very cheap.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000
And it's a real thing.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000
I mean, it's a real thing to not want cool pizza.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000
I can hear you guys.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Yeah, go ahead.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000
My character's name is Horde God.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I'm an elf.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000
You're a dwarf.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
I'm a dwarf.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
I was just testing you.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000
People don't know the difference these days.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000
My mother was a dwarf.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
My father was a dwarf.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:13.000
They were both very smart and came to the United States as a science team.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:18.000
I do not have the most beautiful face, but I have reasonable looks.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:24.000
And for some reason, a characteristic of not aging,

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.000
I was always a precognitive child.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:33.000
I was born a precog, that is to say that I can sense future events.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Oh, you're like Jeff.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:47.000
There is a gelatin that floats in the sky that you cannot see or touch,

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:53.000
but I can perceive it and perceive from it and draw from it such things as horrible accidents

01:55:53.000 --> 01:56:00.000
and crimes and misdemeanors, et cetera.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:07.000
My mother sensing this would put me to some sort of persecution, built a precog bath in the basement.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:12.000
My father, being scared of this, ran away.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.000
She educated me in the ways of precognition, though she herself was not the precog,

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.000
but she was a good reader and a great teacher.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.000
At a certain time, I was urged to leave and try to find employment.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Children would laugh at me in school, and I did not do very well because of this,

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
and so I took small jobs.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.000
I was very old, and I got a job as a busboy.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:43.000
I worked with the underground restaurants and bars.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
They did not know if I was a boy or a man.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000
I was at this age a man, but they would say, hey.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
How old were you?

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.000
At this point, I was some 26 years old.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000
So, of course, this is 2074.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Is that correct?

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Close enough.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:11.000
I worked making the most money onto the table in cash with mafia and jacuzzi families,

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:16.000
both in the nighttime working in the little Italy section

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:23.000
and in the evening working in a little Osaka.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000
They had no problem spilling their information to me,

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.000
so I learned a lot about the underground and how it works.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.000
You'd be very surprised to know that the underground is really the overground.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Everything that works in front of you is moved by people you do not see.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:43.000
It is not called shadow run for no reason.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:51.000
You must think into opposites, and you must be neither.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Because I still have precognition, I like to go outside at night

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:05.000
when the machines are humming and whirring and the night air is moist.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
It is there that these thoughts come to me,

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:13.000
and once such night to go out and the boss of my place in little Italy is crying.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
He's smoking a cigarette and crying.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000
I say, what is your problem?

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
He says, you can go home.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
There will be no restaurant tomorrow.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.000
I cannot explain.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:30.000
I go back to my studio apartment, which is not so much an apartment

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000
because there is no floor.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:39.000
There's only a tub of water in which I built a precognition tub for myself.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:45.000
From this, I put on opera, sauvage, a composition by Vangelis.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Tasty choice.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:56.000
A precognition suit such as Samantha Morton might wear to an event or a gala.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
You love that minority report.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:07.000
I lay myself above and using the power of rear thought suspend myself without a net over the water.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:12.000
And I saw an incident at which a man with a loaded pistol would come to him

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.000
and shoot my boss's brains out.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:20.000
I waited for the vision of a woman with a wristwatch to walk by

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:26.000
and focused on the wristwatch, got the time of day knowing that it was night

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:33.000
and there is no 2.36 that PM that is at night.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.000
I sensed it was 2.36 a.m.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.000
I went to the cross streets and waited.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000
What time was this at?

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000
2.36 a.m.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
What time did you get the vision?

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I got the vision at 2.34, but this was the day before.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Oh, okay, so you had plenty of time to get there.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000
I had plenty of time to get there, but no, I had to get a weapon.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.000
I had to stuff the man with the weapon.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:04.000
I got the weapon from a Yucuza boss in Osaka.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:09.000
I then waited on the corner when I recognized the man and I saw the woman with the watch.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
I raised the gun, I shot him in the head.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:18.000
I then had to go on the run deep into the annals or annals of Little Italy

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:21.000
where I met a man who would become my father figure.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:27.000
His name was Gepetto 5.0

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:35.000
who outfitted me with silicon and cyber devices, arms.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000
I'm sorry.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
We just heard the cold open.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.000
He's just now becoming...

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:48.000
This is the opening narration.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:53.000
At what point do you flee to Brazil as a Nazi doctor?

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Because you sound like a Nazi doctor.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:00.000
At what point do you launch an award-winning career as a documentary director?

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Anyway, sorry.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.000
If I were, I would do something like this and something different.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.000
But anyway, I have a cyber device to touch on.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Excuse me, go ahead.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Would you better 5.0 continue?

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Yes.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:15.000
He just gives me a number of attachments and things and ways to better myself,

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:20.000
including skill softs which are programs that allow me to master certain tasks

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
and things through a cranial implant.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.000
And with this, I can function for myself.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.000
But I cannot go back into that world, although I have all of this knowledge of how they operate.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:37.000
And so I run around in the shadows between streets and avenues and boulevards and byways,

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.000
bartering with what I know to do best.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:47.000
And that is to sneak up and stop problems, sense problems, eliminate situations.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Sometimes with weapons, otherwise with cunning and guile.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:58.000
I can occasionally step out into the light because everyone still thinks I'm a boy.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Oh.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Oh.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Wow.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Uh-oh.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Wow.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Everyone still thinks I'm a boy.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Wow.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:14.000
I guess if David wants to tell us about his character, we'll just...

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:19.000
My name is Chrissy Tilmick.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:26.000
I am a 12-year-old LGBT transgender.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:35.000
I was born with six toes on each foot, but I now currently have three on each foot.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:42.000
And my father killed chickens with his mind.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:46.000
We would travel from small town to small town.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Some people were enamored of that.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Some people thought he had great powers.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Some people were scared of him and frightened.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000
As a result, we were constantly moving.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.000
We had a 1969 Dodge Dart.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:06.000
And one day, my mother and father were very much in love.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.000
He had sworn on their wedding day.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:14.000
They loped, but it was still a wedding and it was a day, so it was a wedding day.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:19.000
That he would never use his ability to kill chickens with his mind in any negative way

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:20.000
towards her.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:29.000
One day, we were chased out of a town, Birmingham, Alabama, and he was drinking heavily

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:35.000
and he started what looked like the process of trying to kill my mom.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
It was gone.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
That upset me terribly.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
I went running out.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:49.000
My mom chased me and she was killed by a heronado, which is a...

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:54.000
As everyone knows, after the year 2021,

02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:02.000
government Obama was still in office and invented heronados,

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.000
which is a combination of a hurricane and a tornado.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:11.000
That was shortly before they revealed chemtrails are a real thing.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.000
They're not just silicon.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
So my mom was killed.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000
It was a terrifying thing for me to witness.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
As I looked behind my...

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I had three shoulders and I looked behind the middle one.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:30.000
I could see my dad running after and the entire town of Birmingham, Alabama,

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
he got swallowed into the...

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.000
As they grabbed him and they pulled him and he was like,

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Chrissy, Chrissy!

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.000
And I could see it was scratching at the ground and blood came from his nails

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000
and went down to stubs as he was trying to claw his way to me.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:52.000
I just knew it was fight or flight and I decided I'm going to flight.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:59.000
And I went to Birmingham International Airport

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.000
and I used all my remaining...

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:07.000
I had some fun bucks left over from a Chuck E. Cheese and I turned them in.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:17.000
I got on a plane to 2032, which was the only time I could afford.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
And there I...

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:25.000
When I got off the plane, I just did that classic Chrissy Tillman thing where I looked down

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:30.000
and the first sign I saw was for Davos and I went,

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:38.000
I'm your guy and I got in the car and ended up at a Davos conference.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Jenna Bush was speaking and I managed to sneak into her hotel room

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.000
in a way that I'd only seen in hollow movies,

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000
which is a way that people watch movies in the future.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:57.000
He got that right, he got that right.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.000
By being underneath the catering tray table

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:07.000
and then I snuck out and I assumed Jenna Bush's personality

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:12.000
and her identification tron.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Which was, she didn't even put away, it was in the closet, the closet was open.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
I just took Jenna Bush's...

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
She just left her identification tron.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000
He just added tron.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Yeah, this shit is easy.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:41.000
And I remembered, as I was climbing the antenna spire,

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:46.000
I remembered, wait, my mother, her last dying thing,

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:52.000
as the heronata was sucking her into the vortex,

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:56.000
and she threw the pills at me and said,

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:00.000
should anything happen, take these pills.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.000
And I did, and then I went back in time to where we were a happy family,

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.000
but I was always able to access everything post that.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:11.000
So not only am I currently with my happy family

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.000
knowing what the future will bring,

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.000
but I also concurrently run in the shadows,

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:21.000
because I fucking love that song.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Wow, what a character.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
I think that's the end of our show.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Wait, I have my guy.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000
What's that?

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.000
I have a guy too.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Oh god, oh god, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Don't forget me saying, I think that's the end of our show.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:43.000
I'm just gonna read this, and that'll be the end of the show.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.000
My guy talks like me.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:49.000
I'm just gonna read what you said, is that okay?

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Unless you have any great ideas that have come up to the surface

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
from these wonderful narrations.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Is there a him, Nato?

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:05.000
When we looked at it, what we thought was...

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:10.000
It sounded like a herstory moment, but...

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.000
I'll have to check with the ladies at Vassar and Sarah Lawrence,

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:17.000
the feminist studies group, see what they think.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Spencer, what is a shadow runner?

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:22.000
A shadow runner is basically like a member of the A team.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:25.000
When people need their help and they can afford it,

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
they get the A team, you know?

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
And they do illegal stuff, they do cool things.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
But they're usually good guys?

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000
No, I mean, they're criminals, they could be murderers, assassins.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:38.000
They ride in a van and they have lunchboxes with their faces on it.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Typical mercenary.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.000
I'm just gonna read the paragraph.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Dr. Friend, that's my guy's name.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Unless you have a better name.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:53.000
I don't think you can talk Dr. Friend.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Dentist, Frank.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Dentist friend is the troll doctor, dentist.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:08.000
A criminal slash doctor whose practice is everywhere the core aren't.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Corpse, like corpse corporations.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Sorry, everybody.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Dr. Friend is a troll doctor.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.000
I have to start over every time someone says something.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Do try periodonist.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Periodonist friend is a troll periodonist.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:37.000
A criminal slash periodonist whose practice is everywhere the core aren't.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Periodonist friend has a magical mastery over medicine and the metahuman body.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.000
With a less than firm commitment to the Hippocratic Oath.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Nice.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
That was a little glib.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:56.000
With a less than firm commitment.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Alright, CW, I see what you mean.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Periodonist friend is bound to never harm anyone who hasn't harmed him first.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Originally a corporate periodonist.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
For fun, can you say endodontist?

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Endodontist? What is that?

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.000
It's root canals.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Just root canals?

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Yeah, basically it's nerves.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Periodontist is guns and endodontist is root canals.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Sounds so drunk right now.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.000
It's basically nerves.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.000
It's nerves, roots, root canals, nerves.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Endodontist?

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Endodontist.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Okay, I mean, it's not important.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Oh no, I didn't mean to qualify that as being important.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.000
It's not important, say whatever you want, say periodontist.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:56.000
I thought we were giving a request like you were a DJ at a birthday party.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
So I said endodontist.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Originally a corporate endodontist.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:04.000
One friend, one friend, that's me.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.000
That's me.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.000
One friend goblinized into a troll.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Goblin is not a verb.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Goblinization is a thing that happens in the history of the Shadowrun milieu.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Vampiric virus.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
I turn from human into a troll.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Yeah, trolls just get turned into them from humans.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:28.000
He was cast out of the corporation with extreme prejudice,

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:31.000
forced to ply his trade in the streets.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Despite this fall from grace, he only accepts payment from the moderately wealthy

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000
for his superior service.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Treating the poor and needy free of charge.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Sounds like a good guy.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Sounds like a friend.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Sounds like a friend, that's right.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
That's all I need to say, right?

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.000
I prefer not to fight, but when I must, I tend to favor not only the weapons

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:59.000
such as a stun baton or gel and shock rounds from my silent submachine gun.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.000
That sounds like a very violent weapon.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.000
I use no weaponry other than this submachine gun.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:11.000
I think at a moment when someone would go,

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:16.000
that's really nice that you take care of poor people for free.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:20.000
You say it in an alleyway just to that other person, you go,

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:23.000
the poor become the rich.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.000
And the rich are always dying.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.000
And they'll always be more poor.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Did you just come up with that quote?

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
That's really good.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Are you being sarcastic?

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000
No.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Really?

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:38.000
It's really good.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.000
It's like the blind guy in Minority Report.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.000
I like it.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
I think I might be a little drunk.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.000
I should be riffing dialogue for you.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.000
That was really good.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Thank you.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Doesn't the logic collapse under the poor become the rich?

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Doesn't that stop right there?

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
This is a fantasy world, David.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:01.000
It's a weird world where if you're poor, you're safe.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
But you have teeth problems.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:07.000
And then only your ambition to become rich eventually kills you.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.000
I like that this is the least believable bit of this for you.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
The poor become the rich.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.000
No, I've heard everything.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Shadowrun's a fun game, but in terms of wealth distribution,

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.000
a lot like our world.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
I'm not sure I believe it.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.000
All right.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Well, we've conquered all these worlds.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Now how do we end things?

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Probably with a rap, right?

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.000
I'll do a rap.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Do a rap.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap,

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.000
clappity clap time to rap.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Every rap has some kind of rap jazz.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:53.000
When you rap your ass, the person you came in as,

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
and I accept you.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:58.000
To get to do, to get to do, to get to do.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:13:59.000
I accept you.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:02.000
It's funny that David thinks that this is your rap every time.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
The great thing would be to do a rap

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.000
and have David Cross, who has a beautiful angelic voice,

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:13.000
do the rap bridge, the R&B, like, do, do, do.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Do we have a rap beat?

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
I think so, yeah, yeah.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.000
All right.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
So I'll do a little bit and then I'll cue you

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.000
and then you do like the, you do like the, you know, the bridge.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
The singing part.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:40.000
We hope you come back to the show.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:50.000
City sirens, police in the distance, cityscape.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:53.000
I'm gonna go the distance up.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.000
I'm Dr. Urban Anthropy.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.000
I'm gonna cut you, can't you see?

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
I'm going through the shadows at night.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.000
I'm gonna rap for my life, gonna fight for your life.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
I'm gonna, I'm Mr. Mixa Plick.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
I'm gonna shoot you.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:12.000
I'm gonna fucking shoot you in the, in the tooth you.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
I'm gonna shoot you in the shoot you.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:18.000
And then I put your life inside my shoe though.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:24.000
I'm in shoot you with shoot you.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:28.000
I'm gonna rhyme a life with life.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Gonna rhyme one word with the exact word again.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Let's grab a dammit.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:41.000
And that's how I wrap my life.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:45.000
Alright.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
David Cross.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
That's our show.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.000
We'll see you next week, I think.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Did you get any of that?

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:06.000
It's a good show.
