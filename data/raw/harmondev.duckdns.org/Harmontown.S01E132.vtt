{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:25.000\nMusic\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:26.000\nThank you!\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:30.000\nBoy, what a show we have for you tonight.\n\n00:30.000 --> 00:32.000\nWe do have a pretty great show.\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:33.000\nWhat an important show.\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:35.000\nI mean, we got to do the most important thing at the top of it.\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:37.000\nYou know, I don't know if it's...\n\n00:37.000 --> 00:39.000\nbut it's got to be dealt with immediately.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:40.000\nWe had a show...\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:42.000\nThe last time we had a show,\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:45.000\nthe feedback was...\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:47.000\nit was voluminous.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:48.000\nReally?\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:50.000\nI wasn't here for that show, so I don't...\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:51.000\nI'm not caught up.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:55.000\nTalk to me as if I'm a baby, I don't know.\n\n00:55.000 --> 01:01.000\nThere was a problem unique to just societal groupings.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:03.000\nLike, it's a problem that, you know, how do you...\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:04.000\nhow do you solve it?\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:05.000\nWe've been through this before.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:07.000\nHarmontown is supposed to be a tribe of misfits.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:09.000\nWe're going to colonize the moon.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:11.000\nAnd so what do you do about your Adam Goldbergs?\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:12.000\nYou know, are they...\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:13.000\nAre they mascots?\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:15.000\nBecause they're the misfits of misfits?\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:18.000\nOr are they somehow an opportunity for us to prove\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:20.000\nthat we too can rule the earth by, you know,\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:22.000\nwe just crucify them?\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:26.000\nAnd go like, yeah, no, even we have lines.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:27.000\nOh.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:29.000\nDo I get to vote?\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:32.000\nI'm voting against that.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:35.000\nI think, you know, I believe in open systems.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:38.000\nI don't think that Key and Tumblr societies\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:40.000\nare ever going to evolve.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:42.000\nI think you have to have one code,\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:44.000\nand you have to be able to follow it no matter what.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:47.000\nAnd our code is, no one gets bullied, everyone fits in.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:52.000\nSo then last show, like, just from Twitter to Reddit\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:53.000\nand everywhere in between,\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:56.000\na lot of feedback about this guy's laugh.\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:07.000\nNow, we're going to bring him up and put a face on this problem\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:08.000\nbecause I think...\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:10.000\nNo, not in a shaming way.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:11.000\nNot in a shaming way at all, the opposite.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.000\nI want to humanize this guy\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:17.000\nbecause I most of all just feel bad for him.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nI also then second to that,\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:26.000\nI feel bad for 30,000 people that were, like,\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:29.000\nunprecedentedly distracted by this guy's laugh.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:32.000\nWell, it's a tough one because you want people to laugh,\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:33.000\nbut then they laugh too much,\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:35.000\nand you're like, all right, calm down.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:39.000\nTheir laugh just hits that chimpanzee distress call frequency\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:41.000\nso it makes people go, like, I'm glad he's having a good time,\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:45.000\nbut now I feel like a spotted leopard's hunting me.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:46.000\nI don't know.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:49.000\nHis laugh is like a crying baby on an airplane for some people.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:52.000\nThe difficult thing with a society, of course,\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:54.000\nthis is the most difficult of all.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:58.000\nWhat are we going to outlaw this guy's mirth?\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:02.000\nTell him, have less fun.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:05.000\nYeah, that moment when you're least self-conscious and full of joy.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:06.000\nYeah.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:07.000\nTake it down a notch.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:09.000\nYeah.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:12.000\nThen everything we say about the government up here,\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:17.000\nevery time a cop stabs a guy, a cop stab people.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:20.000\nNo, they just shoot them.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:22.000\nI don't read the, well, they stab him with those little,\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nthose flying knives that come out of the knife dispensers.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:25.000\nOkay.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:29.000\nWait, you're thinking of Scorpion from Mortal Kombat.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:30.000\nGet over here.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:31.000\nYeah.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:37.000\nActually, stay there.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:40.000\nWhat was that?\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:43.000\nNo, but it's interesting you're saying that this is the first.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:44.000\nThis is where the line is.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:47.000\nAnd we can't, you know, if we introduce this law,\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:49.000\nthen everything falls apart.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:50.000\nYeah.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nAll the things that we make fun of governments and corporations\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:53.000\nfor doing when they're like,\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:55.000\noh, hey, everybody make up a new flavor of Mountain Dew.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:57.000\nJust have fun.\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nAnd fencing your humanity.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:01.000\nAnd you're not allowed to do this.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:02.000\nAnd you're not allowed to do that.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:04.000\nThen it all breaks down.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:10.000\nWe are judged tonight as a tribe by how we treat laughing men.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:12.000\nThe eyes of God are on us.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:15.000\nAnd I don't, no, I'm excited about it because I don't know what the answer is.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:16.000\nNo.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:19.000\nExcept that, you know, the first step is always communication.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:23.000\nAlways like, like, like, you know, let's, so if, I assume he's,\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:28.000\nhe's willing to come up because he sounds like he's having a wonderful time.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:30.000\nAre you, is it, it's Doug, right?\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:31.000\nOkay.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:35.000\nWe put him in the front row away from the microphones tonight.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:38.000\nDoug.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:41.000\nHave a seat.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:42.000\nHello.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:44.000\nI will say this.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:48.000\nRight off the bat, I'll tell you what pisses me off, Doug.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:52.000\nYou come to Meltdown every week and that's never been a fucking problem at Meltdown.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:57.000\nAre we not funny enough for you?\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:00.000\nIt's just never been commented on at Meltdown.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:01.000\nOh, okay.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:03.000\nBut we don't record Meltdown.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nSo there isn't like Twitter, you know.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:09.000\nIt was like, I remember a night when I could hear it and I was like,\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nmy thing is like, it's not that I don't like it.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:14.000\nMy thing is it makes me feel like a liar.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:19.000\nIt sounds like my uncle's at the show and it's like the cream city comedy competition.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:23.000\nAnd he's like, yeah.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:29.000\nDrive thru his heart for the consumer.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:30.000\nWho's voting?\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:31.000\nWho's voting?\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:39.000\nIt makes me wonder how funny I really am because it sounds like above and beyond.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nBut last week, I wasn't really that conscious of it,\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nbut then it must have been a microphone thing.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nIt's like a sound mix thing or something.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:49.000\nI've never gotten so many tweets about one topic.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nAnd we talk about race here.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:55.000\nAnd you've said a lot of controversial crazy shit.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:58.000\nI call the Irish dirty little potato people.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:01.000\nI got seven tweets from Irish people going, you're right.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:02.000\nWe don't care.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:03.000\nYeah.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:07.000\nBut this fucking, this guy is human Belfast.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:08.000\nHuman Belfast.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:11.000\nThe time of troubles are upon us again.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:12.000\nYeah.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:14.000\nHe's the potato fan of Marmontown.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:21.000\nWe need a peace wall built around him so that the Protestant laugh listeners can get along with the Catholic ones.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:27.000\nSo anyway, all right, Doug, I think you've been, you've been, you've been quiet through all this.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:28.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:33.000\nWhat, what, was it different, was it different last week or last show?\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:37.000\nUh, it was a little high last week.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:40.000\nBut I, oh no.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:44.000\nI'll not, I'll pull the microphone away when I laugh.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:49.000\nUm, but yeah, I know.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\nShould we, should we, I'm sorry, Doug.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:52.000\nIt's all right.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:59.000\nWell, shouldn't we, shouldn't we get like a, shouldn't we, somebody tell him like a really funny joke so that, so we can measure the.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:03.000\nHe's literally hiding the microphone with his palm right now.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nCause some people might not know what we're talking about.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:20.000\nIf we were a sophisticated, like fancy broadcast show, we'd play a clip from last episode where you just hear me going like, like, like, like Jeff at one point, uh, I said, yeah, there's, I was talking about 9 11 conspiracies and back to the future, uh, regarding the Twin Pines parking lot.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:24.000\nAnd Jeff said pine 11.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nYeah, put it to your, put it to your mouth.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:31.000\nSee, I love a good pun.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:35.000\nWhat got you was pine 11.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nPine 11.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:41.000\nThat's the 9 11 of jokes.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:51.000\nI'm also a huge back to the future fan. So, uh, and I, and I always knew consciously watching that, that yeah, there's only, it's lone pine mall. Cause he hit the pine back then.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:55.000\nRight. And some guys going like, whoa, what about, why is there only one shower now?\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nIt's blowing my mind.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:02.000\nWhich is truly not even, not to get too grim, but that's not even a significant event in the 9 11 timeline.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nThe time there was one tower.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:12.000\nI know it happened for a couple of minutes on CNN, but like, we don't want to dwell on that. That's not like, oh, the one tower time.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nThey fucking came down.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nOh my God, we had so much more hope back then, remember?\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nOh, just half as much.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nYeah.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nPeople were outside chanting, you.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nYeah.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:25.000\nYou.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.000\nAnd then it was like, it was like electric company.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:31.000\nAnd then the other half for that loved the people in the other tower.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:38.000\nYou.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nRemember the electric company?\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nSnake.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:48.000\nSee, that's funnier than the pine, pine 11.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:55.000\nWell, okay. So, so, I mean, you know, I think that I'm already, I'm already, I'm already encouraged by the conversation.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nYou were high.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:01.000\nThat's me. I think we can't ask you to stop having fun.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:09.000\nAnd I'm certainly, I certainly believe marijuana should be, should be legal, but maybe for you.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:13.000\nIt shouldn't be, it shouldn't be allowed before.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:14.000\nBefore the show.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nThis is how government start.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nOkay.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:19.000\nMaybe for you.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nYou kind of passive aggressive law.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:22.000\nLaw is law.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:26.000\nIt starts with with with don't eviscerate a prostitute on a foggy cobblestone street.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:27.000\nYeah.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nJust to get rid of Jack the Ripper.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:30.000\nYeah.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:31.000\nNext thing you know.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:36.000\nCraft is running the world.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nThe Tams is chocolate.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:42.000\nWait, that sounds great.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:46.000\nNext time I get an inkling, I won't before coming to Harmonton.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:47.000\nHow about that?\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:51.000\nOh, would you get an inkling to, to, when you want to get high, you mean?\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:52.000\nYeah.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nTo ease the back pain.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:55.000\nOh, really?\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nIs that what it is?\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nBecause of back pain?\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:00.000\nYeah.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:01.000\nOkay.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nOkay.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:03.000\nIt's also, I mean, it's also great.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:04.000\nLike it also feels amazing.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:05.000\nYeah.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:08.000\nSo Doug, were you aware of this controversy before tonight?\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nBefore?\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:10.000\nJesus.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:19.000\nLike, like, like, like Batman is on the toilet right now.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:22.000\nShe keeps getting halfway up.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:32.000\nGoddamn, is there a, I know that laugh.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nBut I'm on the toilet and I'm Batman.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:35.000\nIt's not Bruce Wayne in the toilet.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nIt's Batman.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:37.000\nYeah.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:38.000\nHe's in a cow.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:39.000\nHe's got his outfit.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nThat's the weird thing about the, that's the thing they never explore in the movies\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:48.000\nis that, is that Bruce Wayne has a really, he extends his dichotomous, like weird schism\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nin its personality to the shits he takes.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nLike he's like, I'm going to take a Batman shit.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.000\nYeah.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:58.000\nThe one that flushes my bowels of the scum and crime that have.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nI wish I had that option.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:04.000\nLike every now and then I feel like I want to take a Batman shit, but I can't do it.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:05.000\nYeah.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:06.000\nSo it's like.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:07.000\nYou just pinch out a little Alfred.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:08.000\nYeah.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nPinch out a little Alfred.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nYeah.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:16.000\nI do like five Alfreds in a row rather than one Batman.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:22.000\nTechnically speaking, sir, there is a certain amount of pebbles in your lower colon.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:26.000\nThey could be dispensed of optimum comfort.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:29.000\nHowever, it could be put off to a later time.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:34.000\nAnd then a Batman shit's like, get it out.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:35.000\nYeah.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:36.000\nMy parents did.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:41.000\nI'm going to take the shit out of this shit.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:42.000\nAll right.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:43.000\nWell, okay.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:47.000\nSo Doug, so, so, so what, well, I guess we got a human face.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nWell, let's, let's monitor things.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nLet's see how it goes.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:54.000\nWe love you and we're in your corner.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:57.000\nI applaud everyone speaking out.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:02.000\nI don't know if you needed to be so mean about some of your ways.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:06.000\nI mean, what was some of the stuff they said, Dan?\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:09.000\nYou don't have to, you know, it's the internet.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:12.000\nWe're starting to realize not everything that you don't like makes you want to kill yourself.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:14.000\nYou don't have to use that language every time.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:20.000\nThere's real stuff in the world that should make you want to kill yourself starting with poverty.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nYou can just dislike someone's laugh.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.000\nIt doesn't make you want to kill yourself.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:27.000\nAnd it's not really a place of subtle opinions.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:34.000\nIt's, it's either you love something and want to marry it or you want to kill it with fire.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:36.000\nThat's the internet.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:40.000\nExtreme opinions are the only things that make it to the internet.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:44.000\nAlright, well let's, let's, let's thank Doug and Doug.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nThank you, Doug.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nThank you, guys.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:56.000\nIt's the human face that really solves half the problem.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:59.000\nYou just look at him and go, he looks like a fine young gentleman.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:04.000\nIt's also tough because everything we say he laughs at and it's hard to dislike that.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nYeah.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:09.000\nYeah, I think we figured it out.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:12.000\nMove away from the microphones and live your life, Doug.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:23.000\nI was actually going to say that, well, in exchange for that, we told him, there's no way, why am I sharing this?\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:31.000\nNow I have to share it just because it's funny that I think Dustin told him like, look, if you, you know, we'll, we'll give you, we'll, we'll, we'll always have that seat away from the microphones available.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:32.000\nBut it's a good seat.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nSo now tonight everyone's going to be like,\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nLook at me, look at me.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:39.000\nIt's, it's, it's gonna, yeah.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:40.000\nBut don't do that.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:41.000\nBe cool.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nThere's shame involved, too, don't forget that.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nI do most of the show like this.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:56.000\nAll right, so we, we got, we got, we got, you know, normally I would babble about things I've seen.\n\n13:56.000 --> 14:00.000\nI share my Erin quote of the week.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:05.660\nYes, you have a music cue for this segment called Aaron my wife Aaron's funniest line of the week\n\n14:10.720 --> 14:12.720\nYeah\n\n14:13.200 --> 14:15.200\nThat's\n\n14:15.520 --> 14:17.520\nPerfect number of beats\n\n14:18.080 --> 14:20.080\nAbout six\n\n14:20.640 --> 14:24.640\nI want to make sure I get it right. I wrote it down. We were watching the movie\n\n14:25.360 --> 14:27.800\nThe movie is called a most violent year\n\n14:27.800 --> 14:31.720\nUh and about uh halfway through it\n\n14:32.360 --> 14:36.040\nUh when joseph cambell says a hero should meet with his goddess\n\n14:36.840 --> 14:40.280\nAaron met with one of her own uh that I didn't realize she was meeting with when she\n\n14:40.920 --> 14:43.240\nExasperatingly said from the bed next to me\n\n14:44.840 --> 14:48.600\nOh god just give them their Oscars so they can stop\n\n14:48.600 --> 14:57.560\nIt's a movie about a guy who does not want to get involved with the movie that he's in\n\n14:58.600 --> 15:06.120\nAnd he succeeds for the whole movie. Did you you didn't like the movie? I actually did enjoy it quite a bit\n\n15:06.280 --> 15:11.080\nBut but it's it's kind of remarkable how like the move there's a lot of good movies right now\n\n15:11.080 --> 15:15.560\nAm I am I have I passed my curmudgeon phase and I'm now just a wild-eyed babe in the woods\n\n15:15.560 --> 15:19.560\nAm I now in that weird creepy uncle like I love pokemon\n\n15:21.080 --> 15:23.720\nI I feel like like my birdman was really enjoying\n\n15:23.720 --> 15:26.440\nYeah, you're gonna pick up like like I it's not like it\n\n15:26.760 --> 15:30.920\nI thought I thought for a while that I'd do enjoy the kind of movie that might get you know\n\n15:31.240 --> 15:36.920\nMight get awards or have some degree of so uh cultural efficacy that you you were down to transformers\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:41.240\nOr you had to just watch something in french and and you know, I don't know\n\n15:41.240 --> 15:46.360\nI've seen some movies that just saw that that Alan Turing movie the meditation thing if you can see that\n\n15:47.480 --> 15:49.480\nMan, it's gonna I don't understand why\n\n15:50.360 --> 15:52.360\nWhy aren't gay people more angry?\n\n15:53.080 --> 15:57.240\nI didn't I didn't know they invented computers and that we killed them for it\n\n15:59.320 --> 16:01.320\nI use computers\n\n16:01.320 --> 16:11.800\nIf I don't understand they're gay people they never did anything they literally are a problem that solves itself\n\n16:11.800 --> 16:13.800\nJesus christ\n\n16:13.800 --> 16:19.160\nI would say I lost that you're scared of them like doing anything you don't have to be yeah\n\n16:19.160 --> 16:24.280\nThere's always another gay person like that they they're not doing they're not trying to do anything\n\n16:24.280 --> 16:30.520\nI like the idea of someone is homophobic, but also like logical about it like they're a problem, but they'll solve themselves\n\n16:30.520 --> 16:32.520\nI'd say\n\n16:32.520 --> 16:38.040\nEven if you put yourself in the shoes of someone who's like terrified like what are you and then we get back to that conversation\n\n16:38.040 --> 16:41.240\nWell, obviously we know what they're terrified of they're terrified that they themselves are gay\n\n16:41.240 --> 16:43.640\nSo they gotta I gotta make a law against how gay I am\n\n16:44.200 --> 16:51.480\nUm, but it's not just that I think it is there's people who are fully straight not afraid of being gay who hate gay people\n\n16:52.280 --> 16:55.000\nDo you are are we sure about that because there's\n\n16:56.360 --> 16:59.320\nThere are so many things to hate like are we sure that all\n\n16:59.320 --> 17:04.280\nAll straight homophobia is not ultimately rooted in\n\n17:05.560 --> 17:07.560\nLike a fear of like\n\n17:08.280 --> 17:12.040\nMan if this was legal, I would suck every dick in this room\n\n17:13.080 --> 17:15.080\nI and I wouldn't know who I am\n\n17:15.640 --> 17:18.440\nI'm gonna get to work in the morning. This has to stay\n\n17:19.400 --> 17:21.400\nForbidden if it's legalized\n\n17:21.720 --> 17:23.720\nI'm gonna suck so much dick\n\n17:23.720 --> 17:32.280\nSo I have to fight it well also like the gay marriage thing you can fell out because why would you hate that what if you already hated gay people\n\n17:32.840 --> 17:37.240\nThen you hated them for what wearing the police hats and dancing and like\n\n17:37.880 --> 17:43.480\nBeing like promiscuous like archetypes of like like oh nothing sacred honey child. I'm gay. Whoo\n\n17:43.800 --> 17:44.760\nI want to dance\n\n17:44.760 --> 17:51.720\nWhy for that mindset wouldn't them wanting to get married and to have georgia kite stroll down the street with his husband holding hands\n\n17:51.720 --> 17:56.200\nAnd with it with fro yo it why wouldn't that make you go? Oh, okay fine\n\n17:56.440 --> 18:00.360\nThe only reason is because you're thinking well, why did I marry a woman then?\n\n18:03.240 --> 18:05.240\nI didn't know I could have it all\n\n18:06.840 --> 18:12.600\nBut it's I think it's also the elected and the thing I love to do in bathrooms\n\n18:12.600 --> 18:20.200\nIt doesn't count as long as it's in a public bathroom. God can't see through stall doors\n\n18:22.840 --> 18:27.960\nUm, I I think then because then they're like oh then it's harder to tell which ones they are\n\n18:28.280 --> 18:32.600\nYou know, like what are they gonna do save us from overpopulation? What's the worst thing they're gonna do?\n\n18:33.320 --> 18:37.480\nWell, but it's true. I mean if you look at like religion and stuff a lot of religions are against that\n\n18:37.560 --> 18:39.640\nSo it's not just people who are gay and scared of it\n\n18:39.640 --> 18:44.440\nIt's also people who are scared of something that is different from them or that they see as being different\n\n18:44.520 --> 18:49.160\nThose religions come from a time when if you weren't having a baby every nine months you were treasonous\n\n18:50.040 --> 18:52.680\nBecause our species was at war with the weather\n\n18:53.320 --> 18:55.320\nYeah\n\n18:56.040 --> 19:00.360\nLike penguins were eyeing us up for the throne right\n\n19:01.480 --> 19:07.560\nLike like well, we're both being eaten by predators who's to say you're not the penguins and we're like keep fucking\n\n19:07.560 --> 19:10.520\nIn hurry up get more kids in the field\n\n19:10.600 --> 19:14.840\nThey're gonna pick corn and then you walk in on your friend steve and your friend neal\n\n19:15.400 --> 19:19.880\nAnd you're and you're like guys come on knock it off. We're we're trying something\n\n19:20.760 --> 19:25.400\nWe're going for something maybe I mean so maybe there was like I'm not I don't want to use the word justification\n\n19:25.480 --> 19:27.480\nthat's the terrible word but but a\n\n19:28.200 --> 19:31.080\nHey, I mean they were they those people thought stars could talk\n\n19:31.080 --> 19:37.080\nThey they they they believed that logs were we're we're good luck on thursday if you\n\n19:37.640 --> 19:41.800\nPainted them black and they had they had reasons to believe that stuff because they didn't have telescopes\n\n19:41.880 --> 19:45.400\nAll right, but once you get a telescope you look through it at your gay friend and you go\n\n19:46.120 --> 19:48.280\nIt just looks like a very up close gay person. I mean\n\n19:50.120 --> 19:52.440\nThere's Saturn there's there's steve and let's\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:57.960\nNo, it's true. I mean it's religion is from a time when before we had like we get a new iPhone every year\n\n19:57.960 --> 20:02.200\nAnd we can't get someone to take another pass at the Quran like you can't\n\n20:04.280 --> 20:09.160\nThere should be some firmware there should be there should be some religion firmware\n\n20:10.280 --> 20:15.560\nJust an update that you have to get and then it's like it was a different time women can aim\n\n20:15.800 --> 20:18.280\nOwn the same amount of property. It's fine\n\n20:18.920 --> 20:20.760\nWe were wrong then\n\n20:20.760 --> 20:26.280\nI think I think we whipped a cauldron into a froth that that our guests is is going to be the most at home\n\n20:26.280 --> 20:28.280\nAnd let's bring up David cross\n\n20:43.640 --> 20:45.640\nAll right\n\n20:51.080 --> 20:55.640\nThere was some extended applause there, I think uh, I think your legacy is palpable in this room\n\n20:55.640 --> 20:58.840\nCan you can you uh in post can you give it another minute?\n\n21:01.400 --> 21:03.400\nOne of you was clapping too hard\n\n21:04.440 --> 21:09.720\nI know there's a there's one guy in the front that makes looping impossible. That's like there's always like this seam\n\n21:11.800 --> 21:18.520\nBut uh, yeah, well, we just started we started touching on this the unsolvable but always fun subject of like\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:24.040\nOf of a most violent year sucking. I know I saw it. I did not care for it\n\n21:24.040 --> 21:28.680\nUh, for so many reasons, uh, I thought he sounded a little too much like Andy Garcia\n\n21:29.320 --> 21:33.000\nI don't care about that. I just thought I mean it's uh, it was\n\n21:34.200 --> 21:36.200\nuh\n\n21:36.200 --> 21:39.080\nIt was everything about it was halfway\n\n21:39.720 --> 21:47.800\nThe the the story was halfway the resolution was halfway the acting was halfway. Well, that was it was like\n\n21:48.280 --> 21:49.560\num\n\n21:49.560 --> 21:51.560\nWell halfway to good, but it was um\n\n21:51.560 --> 21:56.040\nIt was like uh, you it's like what your wife was saying. It's like they're they're\n\n21:56.600 --> 22:01.080\nThey all think they're gonna get an Oscar you can tell they're all they're all that's in the back of their heads\n\n22:01.240 --> 22:06.200\nI like that you're saying everything is halfway, but the name is the most extreme name possible\n\n22:07.080 --> 22:13.800\nA most violent year. I know we kept thinking because in the beginning there's like I got a gas truck gets gets hijacked\n\n22:13.880 --> 22:19.160\nAnd then Aaron and I were saying oh, is this like the cold open and as the truck drives away you pan over to a calendar\n\n22:19.160 --> 22:21.160\nAnd it says january 1st\n\n22:24.680 --> 22:26.680\nIs the whole movie just like\n\n22:27.960 --> 22:29.960\nI I really uh\n\n22:31.080 --> 22:34.760\nYeah, I didn't I didn't care for that movie and uh, have you seen some stuff you do care for?\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nDid what did you think of bird man?\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:37.880\num\n\n22:37.880 --> 22:42.360\nI I enjoyed watching it and I I liked the first two of the six endings\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:45.000\nI preferred the first two\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:51.560\nThen endings uh, three four five and six. I they lost me but um, I will say like I got\n\n22:52.040 --> 22:56.760\nThere's some movies I get to a point around if I can get the three quarters through\n\n22:57.640 --> 23:03.880\nI've already written the mental blog entry of like why this is the best movie ever and if the the last 20 minutes can\n\n23:03.960 --> 23:06.760\nTake a fucking those dive and I'll kind of just push it out of the rug\n\n23:06.920 --> 23:10.680\nWell, the it was it was really enjoyable to watch the acting was great\n\n23:11.160 --> 23:13.000\nuh\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:17.400\nBut I I I'll tell you where I really hit a roadblock\n\n23:17.400 --> 23:22.680\nAnd it was a big one because I really wasn't enjoying it up until this moment, but the the scene with the\n\n23:23.400 --> 23:25.160\nuh, theater reviewer\n\n23:25.160 --> 23:30.840\nThe dialogue was written. It's it felt to me like the dialogue that she her review\n\n23:31.400 --> 23:37.560\nAnd then the thing that he says back to her and then her actual review later all sounded like somebody who's never read a review\n\n23:38.440 --> 23:42.120\nBecause that's not how reviewers talk. That's how when you parody or if you're like, uh, uh\n\n23:42.120 --> 23:43.080\nA\n\n23:43.080 --> 23:46.040\nSophomore in college. That's what you think a reviewer\n\n23:46.600 --> 23:49.640\nUh, and it's just it was bogus. That's a good point\n\n23:50.440 --> 23:55.480\nLike the Emma stone monologue when she's yelling at him for giving a shit about something that's all out of ego\n\n23:55.560 --> 23:59.400\nAnd he doesn't he pretends he's above twitter, but he's doing this ridiculous thing\n\n23:59.400 --> 24:04.040\nI was like, I thought that monologue was really great. It was a well-written like teenage daughter monologue yelling\n\n24:04.040 --> 24:07.560\nThere's a lot of great stuff in there. I just had a but that was the one\n\n24:07.560 --> 24:13.160\nUh dialogue wise, uh, the one yeah, I mean that like that's not how they talk if they were as good at writing\n\n24:13.160 --> 24:17.160\nBut that that reviewer could have easily just been super like they could have written up to her\n\n24:17.720 --> 24:23.640\nAnd had her be a normal a human with her own value system is the hero of her own story with lots of thoughtful things to say\n\n24:23.640 --> 24:27.640\nAnd it would have been just as good. You're right. I never I didn't even think about that. There is a way to hate things\n\n24:27.720 --> 24:31.960\nThank you. No, uh, did you guys see the hobbit?\n\n24:31.960 --> 24:33.960\nI\n\n24:38.040 --> 24:43.800\nHave I saw the second movie and I was like the second of three. Yeah, yeah, it was one book by the way\n\n24:43.800 --> 24:45.640\nI don't know if you guys know there was one book\n\n24:45.640 --> 24:49.960\nYou can't make three movies in a one book. It's so baffling like I love the lord of the rings movie so much\n\n24:49.960 --> 24:52.840\nSo each one of these I watch I said this on twitter\n\n24:52.840 --> 24:56.760\nBut to me like lord of the rings was like making love with the love of your life\n\n24:56.760 --> 25:04.840\nAnd hobbit is like jacking off on a sex doll you found in the trash. It's still a fine way to spend your time\n\n25:05.800 --> 25:08.360\nYou just don't want your wife to be around for one of them, you know\n\n25:08.600 --> 25:15.720\nWait, are you are you jerking off in the exact space place where you found the sex doll? Yeah, no, it's still in the trash\n\n25:16.040 --> 25:17.320\nOh, okay\n\n25:17.320 --> 25:21.160\nSo to onlookers you're just jacking off into the trash and you're like no, no, no, there's a sex doll\n\n25:21.160 --> 25:28.360\nRight, right, right, right a little bit of a thrill to it. Yeah. Yeah, there's an excitement to it. There's a weird\n\n25:29.080 --> 25:30.920\npart where there's like\n\n25:30.920 --> 25:32.920\nYou know, there's like 15 new dwarves in it\n\n25:33.640 --> 25:36.600\nThere's like I don't I haven't seen any of those things. I don't uh\n\n25:37.160 --> 25:42.760\nNot not for you know, not like out of anger or obstinance. I just those things are so silly and\n\n25:43.720 --> 25:49.320\nEven even the original lord of the rings. I didn't see him though. Okay, wait. Oh gosh. I didn't see it\n\n25:49.320 --> 25:51.320\nI you're like a unicorn\n\n25:53.320 --> 25:56.360\nIronically, I don't I mean I don't get uh, I mean I don't\n\n25:57.160 --> 26:01.400\nI don't no judgment. I just know I know myself enough to know I'm not gonna like it\n\n26:01.400 --> 26:06.760\nYeah, yeah, so so that's a good time to bring up that you now just finally I say finally have\n\n26:07.160 --> 26:12.440\nHave launched a career as a director you just made that movie hits which I haven't seen and frankly didn't know existed\n\n26:12.440 --> 26:19.160\nUh, which looks from the trailer to be like everything you would want when you hear that David cross is directing\n\n26:20.040 --> 26:24.200\nWell, uh after the last 10 minutes of what I've just said it better be\n\n26:24.760 --> 26:26.760\nThe most amazing fucking\n\n26:27.320 --> 26:29.320\nPerfect. It has to be perfect\n\n26:30.200 --> 26:31.240\nUh\n\n26:31.240 --> 26:32.600\nBut it looks great and more importantly\n\n26:32.600 --> 26:37.880\nI think the reason why I thought you might want to come on here is because I'm sure you're already at your kickstarter goal\n\n26:37.880 --> 26:44.040\nBecause you're only asking for the kickstarter pitch. I saw was that you you made this movie. It's it's good\n\n26:44.920 --> 26:50.840\nThe distributors involved had this plan to do like new york and la and then throw it onto itunes and come up\n\n26:50.840 --> 26:51.720\nMay yep\n\n26:51.720 --> 26:55.240\nAnd and you know whether yeah, and you're and you're just going come on\n\n26:55.320 --> 27:01.320\nLet's do the let's do the 20 city thing and you looked into it and it costs like a nominal amount\n\n27:01.320 --> 27:09.320\nThey just wouldn't the nobody was interested in pursuing that and the and i'm not knocking uh, the the people involved\n\n27:09.320 --> 27:14.120\nBut the you know distributors are doing a job. They don't care about the movie per se\n\n27:14.120 --> 27:19.400\nThey want to get the best deal they can or at least the sales agents who you hire to represent you to\n\n27:19.880 --> 27:23.240\nMake the deal with distributors, which I found out later. I'm not I'm not\n\n27:24.440 --> 27:28.440\nWell-versed by choice in the business of aspect of things\n\n27:28.440 --> 27:33.880\nUh, uh, I just don't care to I should care to know I'm sure my\n\n27:34.760 --> 27:42.120\nWife would be happier about that, but uh, I I just don't I can't I don't want to think about those things and and um\n\n27:44.360 --> 27:49.160\nAnd so the the what they were what the offers were very there were the absolute\n\n27:49.880 --> 27:51.880\nStandard thing, you know\n\n27:51.880 --> 27:57.800\nLike you were saying it's new york and la and then pick four cities out of the ten biggest cities and they go there\n\n27:58.680 --> 28:00.680\nYou know one college town, you know\n\n28:01.400 --> 28:03.880\nGot to get it in an harbor man, you know and um\n\n28:04.840 --> 28:07.560\nAnd then that was it and then as you said and and that was really\n\n28:08.120 --> 28:11.080\nKind of depressing and then the producers were the ones who said let's\n\n28:11.640 --> 28:19.240\nLet's figure out a way to get this movie in theaters that it would never play in and uh, and so I credit them\n\n28:19.240 --> 28:24.600\nThey're the ones who came up with the idea and they went to a bit torrent and and then we'd we had the idea to\n\n28:25.080 --> 28:29.240\nTo do the Kickstarter, which just allows us to get the movie. We're already at uh\n\n28:30.200 --> 28:37.960\nIf should it trigger we've got 35 cities not even I mean towns places. I've never even heard of saint saint\n\n28:38.840 --> 28:41.000\nThompsonville in vermont and I don't know\n\n28:41.960 --> 28:43.800\nuh\n\n28:43.800 --> 28:47.480\nI mean places it would never play like um, uh, Daytona\n\n28:47.480 --> 28:50.680\nWhat just in the middle of the racetracks?\n\n28:53.080 --> 28:55.080\nYep, just a guy\n\n28:55.080 --> 29:00.360\nThe one guy who's not into racing in Daytona and he lives in the middle. He's running to the drivers so they can see it\n\n29:01.560 --> 29:03.560\nHe's got he's got it on his iphone\n\n29:04.600 --> 29:09.240\nI was like when bugs bunny had that hill that hole that they built a construction site around\n\n29:09.320 --> 29:12.120\nYeah, and then in the future. He was the opposite. He was the only guy\n\n29:12.360 --> 29:13.640\nYeah\n\n29:13.640 --> 29:18.840\nSo is it like these theaters sort of signed up to be like hey, we wanted to play in our theater\n\n29:18.920 --> 29:23.560\nSo if if this Kickstarter thing goes then we would like to play because it's pay what you want\n\n29:23.800 --> 29:28.280\nSo uh in order to do that we need at least enough money to get into the theater\n\n29:28.280 --> 29:32.680\nIt doesn't cost a whole lot, but you have to it does cost something you have to rent the theater pay for the staff\n\n29:33.400 --> 29:38.840\nGet your uh, make sure the film can play in their system. Um, and and you know a small\n\n29:38.840 --> 29:43.080\nAll modicum of uh, you know marketing and stuff gets mads out\n\n29:43.480 --> 29:44.680\num\n\n29:44.680 --> 29:46.680\nAnd that would allow us to go to uh\n\n29:47.880 --> 29:53.000\nIt was uh 22. I think we figured it would allow us to get to and uh, and now we're at all these\n\n29:53.640 --> 29:55.640\ntheaters have approached us and uh,\n\n29:55.800 --> 30:01.720\nIt's cool. I've never been done before. Yeah, this is like I've never heard of any bit torrent is the one who's distributing it\n\n30:01.960 --> 30:05.960\nOnline you said right there is this is the first movie that bit torrent is\n\n30:05.960 --> 30:09.720\nUh, yeah putting out there officially officially. Yeah\n\n30:10.280 --> 30:12.840\nYeah, yeah after years in the business. Yeah\n\n30:13.320 --> 30:16.840\nYeah, they've uh before this they ever make any money\n\n30:18.360 --> 30:21.820\nYeah before this they've put out every movie ever made\n\n30:22.840 --> 30:24.840\nYeah\n\n30:25.240 --> 30:27.800\nYes unofficially, but that's such a cool\n\n30:28.520 --> 30:32.840\nLike how did the bit torrent thing happen like that was the producers they they're the ones who went out\n\n30:32.840 --> 30:35.560\nUh, you know, we were all little uh\n\n30:36.360 --> 30:38.680\nYou know the movie screened well at Sundance. Um\n\n30:39.720 --> 30:41.240\nand\n\n30:41.240 --> 30:43.240\nI don't think anybody had this uh\n\n30:43.800 --> 30:48.120\nYou know illusion that we were gonna somehow become this, you know, amazing\n\n30:48.680 --> 30:50.200\nYou know one of those\n\n30:50.200 --> 30:53.800\nbidding war things where harvey weinstein is you know in between\n\n30:54.520 --> 30:58.200\nChampagne shots and piles of blow is like I want this movie, you know\n\n30:58.200 --> 31:02.520\nSo Skyping from his yacht on the on top of a mountain and um\n\n31:04.840 --> 31:06.840\nYou know the yacht's on the mountain\n\n31:07.640 --> 31:10.360\nThe yacht's on the mountain. Yeah, very he's very wealthy\n\n31:11.880 --> 31:13.880\nYeah, it's his mountain\n\n31:15.080 --> 31:19.720\nUh, it's something his dad said he couldn't do it's the one thing\n\n31:21.080 --> 31:24.840\nHey, man, that's a good engine trying to do shit your dad says you can't do\n\n31:24.840 --> 31:30.920\nUm, so it's yeah, you're where I mean you were within spitting distance of your goal when I looked\n\n31:31.400 --> 31:37.320\nSeveral days ago, um, but more money's probably better than than less if you're interested the more money we get the more\n\n31:38.360 --> 31:41.640\nTheaters we go right right so go to the Kickstarter if you're interested you can find it\n\n31:42.200 --> 31:45.800\nReally easily and uh, you know first give to leukemia if you've got like that\n\n31:46.360 --> 31:48.360\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no\n\n31:49.480 --> 31:53.000\nNo, no, no, no see that's that's short-sighted thinking\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nAll right\n\n31:55.960 --> 31:59.320\nListen his movie's coming out once leukemia is gonna be there\n\n32:00.360 --> 32:04.280\nLeukemia will keep is the slogan for the movie. Don't worry\n\n32:05.320 --> 32:11.960\nI mean a hundred dollars to the uh leukemia foundation ain't doing I mean that's like that's nothing. No, that's nothing\n\n32:12.200 --> 32:15.560\nNo, and a hundred dollars to us. You're gonna make some\n\n32:16.440 --> 32:18.440\nLoser with leukemia laugh for two\n\n32:18.440 --> 32:20.440\nYou know\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:26.120\nI mean you give it give him a little escape two of the last hours of his life\n\n32:27.080 --> 32:29.080\nhe'll laugh\n\n32:30.040 --> 32:36.920\nIt's it's 2015 so now we have to follow that with a paragraph of we're not saying it's funny to have leukemia\n\n32:37.240 --> 32:40.440\nWe're saying it's so unfunny to have it that it's funny and the blah blah blah blah\n\n32:40.760 --> 32:46.840\nUm the uh, yeah, I I understand that the money that goes to leukemia a lot of times what happens because it's such an intense\n\n32:46.840 --> 32:48.840\ndiagnosis to give\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:52.040\nThat a lot of times they'll just give the person a hundred dollars along with\n\n32:53.880 --> 32:55.880\nHey good news and bad news\n\n32:55.880 --> 33:00.280\nLike so that is that is a that is a furnace that you're shoveling your money into it\n\n33:00.680 --> 33:06.440\nIt needs to be shoveled in but but you could you could light a little little dollar bill on fire for david cross\n\n33:06.440 --> 33:07.960\nAnd it'll go a lot longer\n\n33:07.960 --> 33:11.720\nUh, I don't I really really did make a pretty\n\n33:11.720 --> 33:19.320\nWe made a point that was like hey gift to his movie more than gift to leukemia and it made sense. Yeah\n\n33:21.560 --> 33:27.000\nYeah, yeah, I mean it's that's the great thing about uh this podcast is if if you're\n\n33:27.960 --> 33:29.960\nIf you pay attention you might learn something\n\n33:32.520 --> 33:38.840\nMovies called hits it's called hits right called hits. Yes. So is there is there ever going to be a rule about\n\n33:38.840 --> 33:43.240\nSo you got your um, you got your hebdo\n\n33:43.880 --> 33:48.120\nDeaths with the more of the mohammed thing. This is a fuck of a segue. Yeah\n\n33:50.920 --> 33:55.160\nAnd so this isn't the first time it's happened and it's like like this thing keeps coming up where it's like, okay\n\n33:55.160 --> 34:00.680\nSo some people get get get really upset about the fact that for instance, okay, so these guys are\n\n34:01.400 --> 34:05.320\nUh a cartoon made them hurt people and that obviously makes them the bad guy\n\n34:05.320 --> 34:10.200\nBut then why cnn? Well, you're doing the story and then you hold up the cartoon as it blurred out\n\n34:10.520 --> 34:14.680\nAnd then there's other people and I because I don't want to jump on that bandwagon and go well\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:16.920\nBut wait a minute. You're watching cnn\n\n34:16.920 --> 34:23.000\nWhat are you a big fan of like overriding all societal like taboo because otherwise there would just be\n\n34:23.240 --> 34:28.200\nYou know what a corporation would put on tv to make you keep watching it would just be a big dick with toothpaste coming out of it\n\n34:28.200 --> 34:29.160\nlike\n\n34:29.160 --> 34:31.880\nThey wouldn't they wouldn't if you didn't give a fuck they wouldn't give a fuck\n\n34:31.880 --> 34:37.400\nThey would just be twinkies and fucking tits on the tv and they would go back go back to the dick with toothpaste\n\n34:39.160 --> 34:42.120\nWhat I backed off of that because that's a pitch that i'm trying to sell\n\n34:43.960 --> 34:48.280\nWell, what kind of toothpaste did you guys see did you guys see stripe red and white?\n\n34:48.360 --> 34:51.720\nDid you guys see sparkly bubblegum like kid toothpaste?\n\n34:52.520 --> 34:54.520\nred and white stripes would be gross\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nRight, that's crazy\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nI\n\n35:01.720 --> 35:04.600\nJust I'm saying I don't want to see a red stripe coming out of my dick\n\n35:05.400 --> 35:08.600\nBut you want to see other kind of toothpaste coming out of your dick\n\n35:08.680 --> 35:14.920\nWhoa, if I came and it didn't hurt and it was blue with crystals in it\n\n35:16.200 --> 35:18.440\nI I would I would I would be like\n\n35:19.160 --> 35:21.160\nWhoa, what the fuck\n\n35:21.160 --> 35:27.720\nBut if I if there was a red stripe in it, I'd be like fuck. There's a difference\n\n35:27.800 --> 35:31.720\nYou don't think the crystals are gonna hurt the inside of your urethra. It's so naive\n\n35:31.720 --> 35:34.360\nI just said it didn't hurt. That's why I prefer it was not hurting because\n\n35:34.840 --> 35:38.440\nOkay, I did say that I I would I would think you're more of a toms guy\n\n35:42.520 --> 35:47.720\nGiven your druthers I just I don't even come I might but the head of my dick is one of those crystals\n\n35:47.720 --> 35:53.240\nYou just rub it on your skin and it uh, I switched I switched to deodorant\n\n35:54.200 --> 35:56.200\nBut finish that sentence\n\n35:57.080 --> 36:00.200\nIt didn't make sense because I switched to deodorant analogy and it doesn't make sense\n\n36:00.440 --> 36:04.600\nFinish the sentence. So I see so deodorant. Yeah, that's so you don't get Alzheimer's\n\n36:04.600 --> 36:07.800\nSo when you when you masturbate you don't get Alzheimer's right\n\n36:08.440 --> 36:12.520\nBecause what you do no you it is the crystal. Oh no the crystal. All right, all right\n\n36:12.520 --> 36:20.040\nThe crystal deodorant is because people are afraid they because uh, uh, somebody read something somewhere 15 years ago\n\n36:20.440 --> 36:25.960\nAnd they're like, oh shit. This has aluminum in it. That's gonna make give us Alzheimer's. So give me that rock\n\n36:27.960 --> 36:31.640\nGive me the rock that the woman who calls herself the a good witch\n\n36:32.600 --> 36:35.480\nSold me on venice beach for 60 dollars\n\n36:36.520 --> 36:40.040\nThere's a witchcraft store. There was a witchcraft store in my neighborhood\n\n36:40.040 --> 36:44.120\nWhere they would sell like bullshit like that and it just shut down and now it's a shoe store\n\n36:44.440 --> 36:49.320\nAnd I was like kind of happy and sad at the same time because it's like kind of fucked that woman\n\n36:49.560 --> 36:51.080\nbut also\n\n36:51.080 --> 36:53.080\nI could buy shoes anywhere, but\n\n36:53.240 --> 36:57.240\nBut here's the thing here's the thing about those folks. I don't think they're I I\n\n36:57.800 --> 37:02.200\nYou don't think they're hucksters. No, I don't I don't think a lot of the people that I'm that I\n\n37:02.680 --> 37:08.520\nThink about when I think of you know, like those women or guys on venice beach or in woodstock or\n\n37:08.520 --> 37:11.240\nOr, you know, san francisco, whatever the fuck they are and\n\n37:13.160 --> 37:15.160\nYou know, uh\n\n37:15.160 --> 37:22.680\nI don't think they're trying to rip you off. I really don't I think they're I think they're, uh, uh, naive and dumb sort of\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nBecause they believe those things but\n\n37:28.280 --> 37:30.280\nBut now now I'm getting close to\n\n37:30.760 --> 37:34.120\nI'm describing, you know people in my life that I love so I can't\n\n37:34.120 --> 37:37.160\nI have to step it back a notch\n\n37:38.840 --> 37:41.000\nI I mean there was a the so\n\n37:42.680 --> 37:46.760\nWhat a pin in my so you're holding up a a picture of mohammed on the news\n\n37:47.720 --> 37:51.640\nAnd they're blurring out really derailed by the toothpaste out of the dick thing, huh?\n\n37:52.280 --> 37:55.320\nSo now next to that somebody tweeted me this story, which I didn't know was a thing\n\n37:55.880 --> 37:58.920\nIf you live in new york and you go back and forth between new york and israel\n\n37:59.160 --> 38:01.080\nSo I don't know how long this has been a thing\n\n38:01.080 --> 38:05.480\nBut someone tweeted me an article about how it's a thing the heretti on the yes. Yes\n\n38:06.440 --> 38:10.040\nThey they can I put a quick plug for a website?\n\n38:10.600 --> 38:12.040\nSeriously, I'm not joking\n\n38:12.040 --> 38:19.000\nWhere they have there's a website called failed messiah.com and I am I am one of the very few people who\n\n38:19.720 --> 38:26.120\nSays that we should make more fun of jews and I and I not reform jews. They're boring, but I'm talking about\n\n38:26.600 --> 38:28.600\nOrthodox jews. They're just\n\n38:28.600 --> 38:31.640\nAwful terrible backwards people that\n\n38:33.240 --> 38:35.240\nThat they really are\n\n38:35.400 --> 38:37.400\nsexist\n\n38:37.400 --> 38:39.400\nAnd there's a lot of\n\n38:40.040 --> 38:42.040\nThey're just terrible. They're terrible\n\n38:42.040 --> 38:47.160\nAnd um, well, but they there are always they always linked to those articles\n\n38:48.600 --> 38:52.280\nAnd I think well, it's so so there's a little theme that we constantly see happen\n\n38:52.280 --> 38:57.800\nWhat is the article about well the article is that well the article that I read was an editorial by somebody that was just fed up\n\n38:57.800 --> 39:03.560\nAnd just going like enough already. Can we make this fucking illegal? You cannot obstruct a god damn tell them what what is it?\n\n39:03.560 --> 39:09.560\nYeah, I don't understand. Okay, so if I if I'm explaining this correctly, there's a you know as you get into the more\n\n39:10.200 --> 39:12.200\northodox\n\n39:12.520 --> 39:18.200\nForms of Judaism there's what depending on what sect I don't know if I'm using the right language, but there's some dudes\n\n39:18.200 --> 39:20.120\nIt's a chesedom the heretti there\n\n39:20.120 --> 39:26.440\nThere's different factions of all if you're ultra orthodox and they they're all kinds of ultra orthodox\n\n39:26.440 --> 39:29.800\nAnd they can't they get on the plane and they go, oh\n\n39:30.440 --> 39:32.840\nI I can't sit next to a woman\n\n39:33.400 --> 39:36.440\nBut not I can't I won't all right, right?\n\n39:36.840 --> 39:39.880\nUm, and so some you know, it's uh, you read the comment section\n\n39:39.880 --> 39:43.000\nIt's like on fire and it's like it and all kind of comes down to me for like well\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:49.080\nHow is this is this is this guy an 18 year old traveler and like like like what is this really the first time that he's\n\n39:49.320 --> 39:53.160\nYou know, is he is he actually being brave this person who's going like oh, shit\n\n39:53.160 --> 39:58.520\nI I'm being pressured by this secular machine to like do this thing. No one warned me about this\n\n39:58.760 --> 40:04.440\nBecause it's it when I read the article is like this this stinks of airlines need to nut up\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:08.440\nLike corporations that we give all this power to stop letting women on your plane\n\n40:12.120 --> 40:18.680\nPut a fucking sign up explaining to anyone flying from new york to israel or vice versa that that there is a very likely chance\n\n40:18.680 --> 40:20.680\nYou will be sitting next to half the population\n\n40:20.680 --> 40:22.680\n50 percent chance\n\n40:23.240 --> 40:25.240\nWell, you know, they're also\n\n40:25.960 --> 40:30.760\npoint zero zero one percent of the population who still believes in this archaic\n\n40:31.400 --> 40:33.960\nthing and and we but we accept it\n\n40:34.440 --> 40:40.120\nUm, and and one of the issues and I didn't read this particular editorial, but I know one of the issues is that\n\n40:40.680 --> 40:47.000\nUh, it was in particular was delta airlines. Um, they don't want to lose their business because is it a it is a lot\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:52.040\nThat's exactly what I'm saying. It always ends up being money. It's never this difficult west wing thing where it's like\n\n40:52.040 --> 40:55.800\nWell, what's the right thing to do? It's money. You follow the money. It's somebody's being greedy by not\n\n40:56.360 --> 41:01.560\nExplaining to these people and it's fucking awful what they do what they what they let them get away with and eventually\n\n41:01.880 --> 41:07.960\nEventually people are are pressured and it's it's a major flight new york to israel. You know, it's uh, it's a long\n\n41:08.520 --> 41:12.040\nBut I mean, it's like if you got to get there. I assume you have to get there for a reason\n\n41:12.040 --> 41:14.040\nYou're not like I got a couple days ago\n\n41:14.040 --> 41:16.760\nYou know, so so eventually people are like\n\n41:17.560 --> 41:19.880\nFine. I'll give them a right about you. You know\n\n41:20.920 --> 41:28.280\nUh, the the the I mean, I think that the I I put those side by side for one because I don't want anybody to perceive\n\n41:28.360 --> 41:33.400\nMe talking about what we got to figure this out as having to do with any particular religion\n\n41:33.400 --> 41:39.080\nI think that all of religion in its most like kind of like concentrated forms\n\n41:39.080 --> 41:43.720\nUm, the word archaic could be used like like like because it's like let's face it\n\n41:43.720 --> 41:49.720\nThese are being held over from from times before airplanes and things and so they're they're rubbing up against modern\n\n41:50.280 --> 41:51.880\ncompletely secularized society\n\n41:51.880 --> 41:57.320\nIt's like what are the rules because we're all wearing pants and if you get on a plane without pants and you say\n\n41:57.720 --> 42:00.600\nIt's my religion. They're gonna say I don't give a shit\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:06.520\nAnd so if and I want people to fess up that it's not it's not really about freedom of religion\n\n42:06.520 --> 42:11.640\nIf a airline is cow-towing to yeah, fuck that anyway. I mean, uh\n\n42:12.360 --> 42:15.640\nI mean because if it was I would I would apply I would be like, well, okay\n\n42:15.640 --> 42:20.040\nLet's try really hard to figure out how nobody ever ever has their bubble births. Let's try\n\n42:20.200 --> 42:22.520\nLet's try and see if we can do it make it happen\n\n42:22.920 --> 42:28.600\nUh, but we'll do it in tears so that some for instance some poor woman who didn't buy a ticket to this fucking ride\n\n42:28.680 --> 42:34.280\nOr if she bought a ticket to the plane, but not this goddamn global roller coaster gets on a plane has a guy in an Indiana Jones hat\n\n42:34.360 --> 42:35.960\nget on the plane\n\n42:35.960 --> 42:41.720\nLook at her stifle vomit go to this flight attendant then double back fall back into the I mean\n\n42:41.880 --> 42:44.520\nWhat do these people do when they're sealed in this tube? There's women everywhere\n\n42:44.680 --> 42:49.560\nUm, but and then some is explaining that they can't they can't do this and they can't do that\n\n42:49.720 --> 42:55.320\nAnd everyone in the plane is like what the fuck I'm like he said I'm on a goddamn deadline. I got a whale at this wall\n\n42:58.920 --> 43:03.640\nOr actually that's the one thing I don't have to do right the whale the wall wales for you is that uh, I don't know\n\n43:03.640 --> 43:08.360\nI only know it by name. I assume the wailing wall. Yeah, it's I think it's I know you go and you dovid\n\n43:08.440 --> 43:10.920\nAnd you pray and then you put the prayer slips\n\n43:11.720 --> 43:13.720\nInto the cracks in the wall\n\n43:14.280 --> 43:19.560\nAnd then and then at night between midnight and 12 o'clock 5 a.m. God tiptoes in\n\n43:20.440 --> 43:21.960\nThey seal it up\n\n43:21.960 --> 43:23.960\nit got tiptoes in\n\n43:24.840 --> 43:26.840\nand uh, he\n\n43:27.480 --> 43:32.280\nIt's and it's they he and Muhammad and jesus go to the dome of the rock, right?\n\n43:32.280 --> 43:37.480\nWhere they all had there were the three major world religions\n\n43:37.960 --> 43:42.840\nUh, have claimed to that the dome of the rock and then they on the temple mount and then\n\n43:43.480 --> 43:49.240\nThey each go in there and it's all uh, they've reduced they've figured out science has figured out that\n\n43:50.920 --> 43:56.840\nThey've they've reduced it to the actual grain of sand that each one can claim to and then they all go and they\n\n43:57.480 --> 43:59.480\nThis is between 12 and 12 o'clock 5\n\n43:59.480 --> 44:05.880\nThey they lick the grain of sand. They lick it. They lick it and then they wink to each other\n\n44:08.040 --> 44:11.320\nGive a little pat on the back side and then they go they're separate way and they go\n\n44:12.360 --> 44:14.360\nThey're like what a racket, huh?\n\n44:16.360 --> 44:18.360\nTrue story\n\n44:18.440 --> 44:24.840\nI want to I want to start a religion where if you're a woman on the plane you'd have to sit next to an orthodox jew\n\n44:24.840 --> 44:26.840\nAnd\n\n44:27.960 --> 44:29.960\nThen let's see what happens\n\n44:30.600 --> 44:33.800\nI uh, yeah, I mean, there's a you know, there's the thing of what you wanted to scream\n\n44:33.880 --> 44:37.960\nWhat we'll start your own airline, but it's like what is that a mandate? We all got to be like fucking they have one\n\n44:37.960 --> 44:44.840\nIt's called LL. Get on fucking LL. Is that yeah, I the so okay, so what's that? I think the pale israel's\n\n44:46.280 --> 44:48.280\nI mean israel being a secular\n\n44:48.600 --> 44:51.160\ncountry, um, it's their their airline\n\n44:51.160 --> 44:55.160\nThey're not oh, oh, yeah, okay, and what are the what is okay?\n\n44:55.320 --> 45:00.920\nSo if that or this is a hugely important question that know that that what did they do on that airline?\n\n45:00.920 --> 45:02.920\nThey must be no strangers to this concept\n\n45:03.080 --> 45:05.240\nSo they must have a speedy way of dealing with it\n\n45:05.880 --> 45:10.120\nAnd what is that? I don't know. I I've never been on that flight nor would I ever I know\n\n45:11.080 --> 45:12.840\nIt was it was more of a rhetorical question\n\n45:12.840 --> 45:15.400\nI'm saying like this is the question that needs to be asked like well, okay\n\n45:15.480 --> 45:19.320\nWhat is the what are the experts do that are in charge of both?\n\n45:19.320 --> 45:21.960\nEx expedient aviation and\n\n45:22.520 --> 45:25.000\nUh, you know not offending, uh\n\n45:25.560 --> 45:32.040\nHere's the core of what bothers me about this situation is they have the ability because they buy their\n\n45:32.680 --> 45:37.320\nTickets and blocks and they travel together in groups. They have the ability\n\n45:38.280 --> 45:39.880\nto\n\n45:39.880 --> 45:44.040\nBuy seats around them or make sure that they're all sitting next to each other and not\n\n45:44.040 --> 45:50.440\nDelay the flight, but they they truly don't care and part of the reason they don't care is because they are\n\n45:50.920 --> 45:57.000\nLed to believe that they are pure and they are better than everyone on that plane. Who's not an orthodox do they're better\n\n45:57.880 --> 46:02.280\nGod views them as better people those other people are not worthy\n\n46:03.080 --> 46:05.080\nAnd that's and so they don't even care\n\n46:05.720 --> 46:11.320\nThat's part of the the the mindset that bothers me you percent. You're like you think like they're\n\n46:11.320 --> 46:16.520\nThey know in advance. They're like, well, we're gonna get on the plane. There's gonna be some chicks and we're gonna have to\n\n46:16.680 --> 46:22.200\nOf course they do. We're gonna hold everybody up. That's pretty insidious. I mean, it's like like like your religious\n\n46:22.680 --> 46:25.240\nThey could take a a a simple\n\n46:26.120 --> 46:28.120\naction to\n\n46:28.840 --> 46:31.320\nNot to protect their own little corner of the world\n\n46:31.480 --> 46:38.680\nYeah, and also to be to be a decent human being with amongst other human beings and a live and let live way to be\n\n46:38.680 --> 46:45.080\nAccommodating to be polite to have a you know, civil discourse. They could they could do that should they want\n\n46:45.720 --> 46:47.000\nBut they don't\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:52.760\nYeah, I think and they don't care to I think there's something like like I'll I'll move off of this hot oven\n\n46:54.520 --> 47:02.280\nWith this I think like I you this conversation confirms my thought like I'm more prone to I mean kumail was raised\n\n47:02.280 --> 47:07.400\nUh, uh, uh Muslim, but it's not practicing. Is that accurate?\n\n47:15.800 --> 47:17.800\nWhat if he is gone?\n\n47:20.040 --> 47:22.040\nYeah, amazing\n\n47:22.920 --> 47:26.760\nI like the idea of someone who's like so against orthodox Judaism\n\n47:26.760 --> 47:32.120\nUm, but it must have come on. No, it is a it's a razor thin wire. This guy walks theologically\n\n47:33.960 --> 47:37.960\nThere actually is a razor thin wire in Islam where that's how you get to heaven\n\n47:37.960 --> 47:42.120\nIs it you have to cross the razor thin wire and if you fall down you go to hell? That's actually true\n\n47:42.280 --> 47:46.360\nThat's actually that's so weird because well, that's that makes sense scientifically\n\n47:48.120 --> 47:50.120\nThat I get that I understand\n\n47:50.120 --> 47:58.360\nUm, I I I'm I'm you you guys I think like yeah, you're you're I'm not gonna get any argument out of you when I say something\n\n47:58.360 --> 48:02.840\nThat's part some valve in my body makes me go like well, don't say it all the way\n\n48:03.240 --> 48:08.280\nBecause to some degree I feel like I'm speaking on behalf of a lot of people that I don't like when I say this a lot of\n\n48:08.360 --> 48:13.720\nOrganizations a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the world around us that I don't like when I say yeah\n\n48:14.280 --> 48:18.520\nUm get over your bogeymen to the extent that it's going to affect other people\n\n48:18.520 --> 48:21.080\nYou just gotta there has to be like this global\n\n48:21.800 --> 48:27.560\nRecognition that you know if you're Amish you you can be as Amish as you want on your Amish farm\n\n48:27.880 --> 48:31.560\nAnd unfortunately it's like still you're being marginalized and you're being disempowered\n\n48:31.560 --> 48:35.400\nBut we got to move on with this fucking planet. We got to get off it before it dies\n\n48:35.480 --> 48:41.560\nWe do that with lasers late. You say you say lasers are are bad luck. Uh, we don't believe you\n\n48:42.040 --> 48:46.280\nUm, we I got to get to work. Um, I'm a woman\n\n48:46.280 --> 48:52.040\nI'm not gonna I'm not gonna grow a dick. I gotta invent a laser in israel\n\n48:52.520 --> 48:56.280\nUm, so so I I think that it's like we we have made that choice\n\n48:56.360 --> 49:01.640\nWe've done but we have we also like feel very queasy about saying it because I don't\n\n49:02.760 --> 49:04.200\nAnd that's I think that's admirable\n\n49:04.200 --> 49:07.400\nI do because it actually is like it's easier to do what I'm doing\n\n49:07.400 --> 49:09.720\nWhich is be Allen all day like like like kind of\n\n49:09.720 --> 49:15.960\nI appreciate the the like let's let's uh, you know be\n\n49:16.600 --> 49:19.880\nCivil about this. Let's listen all sides. Let's let's think about this, but uh\n\n49:21.320 --> 49:27.160\nI didn't have this early on uh, and now at 50. I really don't have it and I I live in\n\n49:29.640 --> 49:36.200\nAn area upstate in New York and um, it's one of the poorest it's near one of the poorest\n\n49:36.200 --> 49:38.200\nUh\n\n49:38.360 --> 49:45.640\nCounties and it's the poorest county because there's a place called. I don't know if I'm pronouncing correctly curious joel and it's um\n\n49:46.360 --> 49:48.360\nit's where\n\n49:49.160 --> 49:57.160\nTens of thousands of orthodox have come in and they're um, and they breed like fucking like catholic rabbits and um\n\n49:58.520 --> 50:00.280\nAnd uh\n\n50:00.280 --> 50:02.840\nYou know, they're they're sapping the public services\n\n50:02.840 --> 50:09.880\nUh, and and the the monies that are and and they're they're like, you know, nine to a room and these in public housing and uh,\n\n50:10.280 --> 50:12.280\nand they have their own\n\n50:12.520 --> 50:20.200\nThey have their they won't let like police. Um, I mean, it's crazy. Uh, and I wish I had more solid anecdotal stuff, but they're uh\n\n50:20.920 --> 50:22.920\nUm, they're really rude\n\n50:23.800 --> 50:27.240\nLike if you ever have an interaction with them, they're really rude and they will not\n\n50:27.240 --> 50:34.040\nUh, acknowledge you and if uh, you know, god forbid you're a woman and you're you hold the door open for them\n\n50:34.200 --> 50:38.360\nYou know, like in a market or something that just won't even right and that's the big deal breaker\n\n50:38.360 --> 50:44.040\nIt's like half the population is women women's rights is like that's the that's what they do their own woman is criminal\n\n50:44.280 --> 50:50.920\nRight, that shit is criminal and that's the that's that's I think going to be finally the the interesting thing about it is that women who\n\n50:51.400 --> 50:56.600\nWho we we freed slaves and let them vote before we before we finally somehow\n\n50:56.600 --> 50:58.920\nBut grudgingly found it in ourselves to say that women could\n\n50:59.400 --> 51:01.960\nWell that I get if you watch any of the real housewives shows\n\n51:02.600 --> 51:08.120\nThat's I mean there's there's a point that it's valid like um, and a lot of the slaves had dicks\n\n51:08.120 --> 51:10.520\nWhich is where the voting power comes from so\n\n51:11.240 --> 51:16.520\nBut it'll be amazing the fact that women are actually like kind of like this weird shield slash weapon that is the final\n\n51:17.160 --> 51:20.840\nLike decision maker in the battle. That's very difficult to have between\n\n51:21.400 --> 51:23.240\num, look\n\n51:23.240 --> 51:31.160\nThere's 8 billion of us now. Are we gonna are we gonna keep entertaining this notion that every single fucking conception\n\n51:31.560 --> 51:36.440\nGets to have its own barbed wire fence around it protected by every goddamn thing\n\n51:37.080 --> 51:43.160\nIf if you believe in this society that that if somebody's hitting their wife and no matter where they're living\n\n51:43.480 --> 51:45.880\nThat you're that they're supposed to stop hitting their wife\n\n51:45.960 --> 51:49.800\nThen we we all agree that we have to like then there's certain freedoms\n\n51:49.800 --> 51:56.600\nThat we have been protecting that may have to kind of erode under the problem is the the uh, the people you're talking about\n\n51:56.840 --> 51:58.840\ntalking to the people that uh\n\n51:59.400 --> 52:02.760\nI mean, I don't probably not a lot of people in this room or listen to this podcast\n\n52:02.840 --> 52:07.640\nBut most people in america and most people in other countries are religious and they have a different\n\n52:07.880 --> 52:15.320\nThey have a different but equally kind of crazy notion. And so if they if anybody points to what is, uh,\n\n52:16.120 --> 52:17.640\nmarkedly\n\n52:17.640 --> 52:22.280\nNear criminal behavior from, uh, certain orthodox jews and sex\n\n52:22.680 --> 52:28.040\nThen the finger is going to be pointed to them and then it's a slippery slope. It dominoes down to and uh,\n\n52:28.440 --> 52:30.600\nAnd then do you think they're thinking that far ahead those people?\n\n52:31.800 --> 52:35.560\nAren't those people the the ones you can really count on if I go to billy grams audience and go\n\n52:35.640 --> 52:39.320\nHey, who wants to make laws against praying to a different god than yours?\n\n52:39.400 --> 52:41.800\nDon't you think they'd sign up immediately and then I could go gotcha\n\n52:41.800 --> 52:47.560\nUm, I don't know if they're are they like, whoa, stay your hand. Jebediah. It's the classic trap\n\n52:49.240 --> 52:52.200\nI think they're we love islam. Yeah, come on\n\n52:53.960 --> 52:56.280\nThat was a lot of stereotypes I made on a whole like\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:03.560\nNo, I think that uh, uh, you know, there there is\n\n53:05.160 --> 53:09.000\nThere's the the if you said, hey, I've got this magic piece of paper\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:12.280\nIf you sign this then this thing will happen and people will sign it happily\n\n53:12.520 --> 53:18.840\nBut it just doesn't work that way and uh, I think you know, um, I mean, let's let's uh, yeah\n\n53:18.840 --> 53:22.840\nLet's go back to islam, which is obviously the much more uh, um\n\n53:23.720 --> 53:25.720\nBe very careful\n\n53:27.640 --> 53:29.640\nIt's it's the more, uh\n\n53:31.320 --> 53:33.320\nIt's the uh, it's the king of beers\n\n53:34.280 --> 53:37.800\nIt's the it's the flashpoint, you know, it's the it's the easy one\n\n53:37.800 --> 53:40.680\nIt's the easy one to uh, to uh\n\n53:42.360 --> 53:45.720\nMake fun of and and and ask questions about like like like yeah\n\n53:45.800 --> 53:49.800\nAnd look at the examine the line between what we perceive as women's rights human rights\n\n53:50.440 --> 53:54.520\nacross the planet and and and like freedom of religion\n\n53:54.840 --> 54:01.560\nYes, it makes the easy surf. I'm happy to say I have I have zero power, but I'm happy to say it's all wrong\n\n54:01.640 --> 54:05.800\nIt's all bullshit. It all should be I mean certain behaviors should be outlawed as as\n\n54:05.800 --> 54:09.960\nUh, you know, I think if it affects other people inside. Yeah, absolutely\n\n54:10.040 --> 54:12.280\nWe got I mean someone has to like stand up and say\n\n54:12.840 --> 54:18.840\nWe are a human planet now that the you know, like like when Jesus said render unto Caesar what is Caesar's like\n\n54:18.840 --> 54:23.000\nLike, you know, because they were trying to get him in like gotcha scenarios where they're like, well, you're gonna pay taxes bro\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:27.640\nBecause if you are isn't that kind of like praying to Caesar and and he's like I if I'm interpreting this passage, right?\n\n54:27.640 --> 54:29.640\nHe's like don't try to catch me in that shit\n\n54:29.880 --> 54:33.960\nYou can be you can be a really holy person in your living room and like pay your taxes go ahead\n\n54:33.960 --> 54:39.640\nLike revolution is not going to happen because you like ran up the court steps and spit in someone's eye necessarily\n\n54:39.640 --> 54:41.160\nI'm not telling you not to do that either\n\n54:41.160 --> 54:42.200\nbut like\n\n54:42.200 --> 54:46.120\nCaesar made the fucking money Caesar loves the money give Caesar his fucking money\n\n54:46.440 --> 54:52.360\nLike let's let's get back to talking about about this other shit. Um, the the like like that idea\n\n54:53.080 --> 54:56.120\nExtended to a now like like like we are\n\n54:56.760 --> 54:59.960\nI mean atheism wins like there is a like the\n\n54:59.960 --> 55:03.240\nThe the like you you look into space and you\n\n55:03.960 --> 55:11.800\nUm, you you you you it's we need to continue to have a relationship with the fact that we're psychomonkeys that don't know what we're doing\n\n55:11.800 --> 55:15.640\nRight, but I want to I want to go back to something you said before I was even brought up here\n\n55:15.640 --> 55:18.520\nAnd you were talking about gay rights and you were talking about\n\n55:20.360 --> 55:22.360\nWhy would\n\n55:23.240 --> 55:25.000\nStraight\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:27.000\nhomophobic men not\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:31.320\nallow gay marriage and and uh, I mean and if\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:35.000\nBy proxy just tolerate\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:37.000\nhomosexuals in society and\n\n55:37.880 --> 55:41.960\nI think the answer I don't know this isn't I've got no scientific\n\n55:42.680 --> 55:44.680\nbasis in this but\n\n55:45.080 --> 55:48.680\nThose are people with some form of religious\n\n55:49.720 --> 55:55.640\nTraining right that's what I was saying exactly. I don't think uh, I don't wear my atheism on my sleeve\n\n55:55.640 --> 55:57.880\nIf I do a show like this, which I don't do that often\n\n55:58.520 --> 56:04.120\nI'll I'm happy to mention it if you get me uh in a in a bar or a pub and we've got a couple pints\n\n56:04.120 --> 56:10.040\nI'll fucking scream to the ratchets, but I don't I don't belong to an atheist society. I don't I'm not a spokesman. I\n\n56:10.600 --> 56:11.960\nfirmly\n\n56:11.960 --> 56:13.960\nvehemently believe in my belief\n\n56:15.880 --> 56:17.880\nThat's there's no belief dude\n\n56:18.520 --> 56:21.160\nYou just fucked yourself with your words\n\n56:21.160 --> 56:28.360\nUm, but I imagine I imagine an orthodox jew saying that to you in that voice. Yeah\n\n56:29.160 --> 56:32.520\nHe just converted. Yeah, and uh, he's in it to win it\n\n56:32.680 --> 56:40.280\nBut no one of the things that makes me proud to be an atheist is I oddly enough to because those people can't understand it\n\n56:40.360 --> 56:44.200\nIs I am tolerant. I'm not tolerant of people who aren't intolerant\n\n56:44.520 --> 56:47.880\nBut I am but I don't know of any atheists who go\n\n56:47.880 --> 56:55.640\nOh, man fucking fags really weird me out. I don't I don't I think uh, I think gays should be shouldn't be allowed to marry\n\n56:55.960 --> 57:01.400\nI think uh, I think it's wrong. I think it goes against everything that's natural is like well\n\n57:01.880 --> 57:03.880\nWho taught you that who told you that?\n\n57:04.200 --> 57:06.200\nme\n\n57:07.800 --> 57:09.480\nYou just don't\n\n57:09.480 --> 57:15.400\nAtheists don't do that. That's a really really I'm sure that point's been been been been pounded at me a lot\n\n57:15.400 --> 57:19.080\nBut it just sunk in like that is a huge just very\n\n57:19.800 --> 57:21.800\nanecdotal but powerful example\n\n57:22.120 --> 57:28.760\nIn favor of atheisms like like evangelism, which my pet peeve is is evangelical atheists\n\n57:28.840 --> 57:32.680\nZealots who they don't I don't like them either. I don't they're not just defending me off\n\n57:32.760 --> 57:35.640\nWomen from being abused under the guise of religion\n\n57:35.720 --> 57:43.400\nThey're bothering to say and that's why if you're in kmart and you think that if you genuflect you might get a better lottery pick\n\n57:43.400 --> 57:49.320\nYou're an asshole and should die. It's kind of like you don't need to let's let's clean up the clean up the living room\n\n57:49.320 --> 57:50.840\nOne potted plant at a time\n\n57:50.840 --> 57:53.560\nI mean, I mean I agree with a lot of what you guys are saying\n\n57:53.640 --> 57:57.720\nBut also like there's a lot of people who are very religious who are doing\n\n57:58.280 --> 58:01.160\nThe right kinds of things and that they're not infringing on other people's rights\n\n58:01.240 --> 58:06.600\nAnd it's whatever whatever you believe that gets you through the day if you think it's a you know rubbing a stone in your armpit\n\n58:06.680 --> 58:12.440\nWill stop it from sweating and not give you Alzheimer's or that there's a god that's watching out for you\n\n58:12.440 --> 58:16.120\nWell, so there's so much human not you beautiful human mythology\n\n58:16.520 --> 58:19.240\nArriving out of the core need for it\n\n58:19.320 --> 58:24.200\nWhich is that when you become a conscious mammal before you have a microscope to tell you anything and by the way what you find\n\n58:24.200 --> 58:26.120\nAre the microscope ain't that heartening?\n\n58:26.120 --> 58:31.480\nBut before you even have that it is a fucked up thing to realize as a mammal that you are alive and that you're gonna die\n\n58:31.800 --> 58:35.880\nAnd and six million years before well, okay, that's going back a little far\n\n58:35.880 --> 58:43.240\nUh three million years before you get to be somewhat comforted by the fact that milk can be pasteurized\n\n58:43.560 --> 58:50.200\nLike you're you're alone in a dark world that basically on the fundamental level still to this day\n\n58:50.840 --> 58:56.200\nFucks you up in the same way, which is like, uh, I'm like why I I start to love my my wife\n\n58:56.280 --> 59:02.040\nLike I was holding her hand in couples therapy and and the therapist was asking me what I think about when I hold her hand\n\n59:02.040 --> 59:05.640\nAnd I burst into tears and said I think about the fact that one of us is going to die\n\n59:06.920 --> 59:11.880\nAnd that's that's existence and that is something that we use mythology with which to to cope with\n\n59:11.960 --> 59:14.200\nWhich is what we were talking about earlier today, right?\n\n59:14.200 --> 59:19.800\nYou and I we were like nothing really means anything if you look at how insignificant we are in the universe\n\n59:20.040 --> 59:21.960\nNothing we do means anything we lie to ourselves\n\n59:21.960 --> 59:24.440\nWe tell us that we do podcasts and that's important and we make\n\n59:24.840 --> 59:28.600\nMovies and tv shows and that's how we get through the day and that's the lies\n\n59:28.600 --> 59:33.080\nWe tell ourselves and then some people tell different lies as long as they don't infringe on my lies\n\n59:33.160 --> 59:39.880\nThat's fine. And the and the and the and the cancer is the cancer comes in when it's when you say you're not allowed to say lies\n\n59:40.200 --> 59:43.800\nRight, you can't say that. What do you mean? It's a lie. That's that's where the problem starts\n\n59:43.800 --> 59:49.560\nSo joseph gamble said like when religion loses its its transparency when it becomes opaque when you start looking at a stained glass window\n\n59:49.560 --> 59:54.600\nLike it's like a thing that has a use instead of just looking at it like this is a neat way to frame something\n\n59:54.600 --> 59:59.800\nWe don't understand and couldn't otherwise see unless it was decorated with this fun fucking flimsy transparent shit\n\n01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:07.000\nLike in this dance we do like when we when we start when we're when we're shooting people because we have because our religion has rules\n\n01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:10.520\nThat should be your first indication in my opinion that that is not a religion\n\n01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:14.280\nYou are not practicing a religion. You are practicing something much more real than religion\n\n01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.360\nreligion's bottle says\n\n01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.360\nThere should not be bullets involved\n\n01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:24.680\nBecause that's politics politics bottle says buy bullets it comes with bullets in the bottle\n\n01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:29.240\nI think you're wrong. I wish that was true, but I think religion is bullets\n\n01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.720\nI think religion has become bullets and\n\n01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:38.600\nBut maybe we could both be agree that politics is the one that exploits that aspect of religion and keeps it going\n\n01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:42.040\nWhereas religion could be your lucky or power power maybe\n\n01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.120\nYeah\n\n01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.800\nbut yeah\n\n01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:49.240\nBut but religion is a and certainly can be\n\n01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.360\nof violent\n\n01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.000\nYou know, what are you talking about? Give me one example\n\n01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.240\nOf religion ever causing any violence\n\n01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.240\nAll right, well, uh, I want to thank\n\n01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:13.480\nLet's uh, let's let's soften up this hard penis like conversation about open-mindedness\n\n01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:18.600\nAnd the importance of our policy regarding religion with the soft\n\n01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:23.480\nIntuitive influence of my wife's vagina. Please welcome\n\n01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.440\nErin McGathy\n\n01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.240\nCan you feel it the vibrations of my vagina\n\n01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:44.680\nAny any thoughts sweetie you you've been listening\n\n01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.960\nUm, uh, I uh, I love it\n\n01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.400\nI feel like you haven't been listening\n\n01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.400\nI mean just the thing when he said the\n\n01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:05.960\nI remember when I was first dating Aaron you brought we went back to my place and you you insisted on playing a 10 minute\n\n01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:10.680\nLike david cross a bit about gold foil being used on desserts\n\n01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:17.480\nAnd we just sat and listened to it like we were like like like listening to the grateful debt or something\n\n01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:22.440\nAnd I think it was like a little test right like if I had gone. Oh, I don't know. Gold foil is pretty cool in desserts\n\n01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.640\nlike you would\n\n01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.640\nYou wouldn't you would have done\n\n01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:31.560\nMy dad is a is a bath Baptist minister and when I was in college I cleaned houses\n\n01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:37.560\nAnd the thing that I listened to over and over again was shut up. You fucking baby. You're 2002\n\n01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.600\nWhich I wasn't gonna mention I was gonna be real cool\n\n01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:48.040\nUm, but I I feel I feel very empowered by david cross's atheism and not\n\n01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:54.520\nThat like talent challenged by it in 2002. I was 18 years old 17 years old\n\n01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.800\nI feel like an idiot, but I've never connected those dots. There is there. There are very\n\n01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.800\nthat like\n\n01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:08.360\nLike 11 11 11 like atheism has has a has a harder work to do to connect to things like\n\n01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:14.360\nMisogyny and homophobia. That's the hard thing is like religion. You have to buy and do all this crazy shit\n\n01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.960\nAll right, what do I get in return?\n\n01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:21.000\nYou get to go to heaven and it's rivers of milk and all the babes you can fuck and it's\n\n01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.640\nThat's the promise of religion, right?\n\n01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:29.960\nAtheism is like this is all there is but we can have fun and it'll make sense and then you die and everything goes away\n\n01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:36.120\nI feel very empowered by like I I wouldn't consider myself an atheist, but I feel very empowered by\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:44.440\nHumanism and like the the way that you talk about atheism in that way the way that you approach it. It doesn't feel hateful\n\n01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.480\nto me. Well, that's good. I uh,\n\n01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:53.880\nI certainly I've certainly been accused of the opposite. I always feel like the most attractive thing about atheism is the fact\n\n01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.440\nIs the same reason why I don't bother quite to uh to go all the way over to it\n\n01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.960\nWhich is it's the edge of the pool\n\n01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.640\nIt is is the real thing that is there to hold you up and keep you from drowning and in the meantime\n\n01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.840\nI'm like, I'm gonna try I'm gonna try to talk about it. I like the holidays\n\n01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.240\nIt's uh\n\n01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.000\nPeople who try to convince you to be atheists are wrong\n\n01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:22.840\nYou either are or you weren't and you should be left alone to do and everybody should be left alone as long as you don't\n\n01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.480\nimpinge on their\n\n01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:29.960\ntheir day-to-day week-to-week year-to-year life or your children and\n\n01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.600\nThat's why like you were saying I really can't stand those\n\n01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:40.600\nproselytizing. Yeah, and uh, it's annoying. It's off-putting and you just you are a yarn\n\n01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.960\nYou you don't it's not like a big struggle and if it is\n\n01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:47.400\nGod bless you on your oh ironic on your um\n\n01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:51.400\nOn your journey, but you you the the the\n\n01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:56.840\nI guess the credo of the atheist should just be simply to yourself\n\n01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.800\nI don't need a book to tell me\n\n01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.360\nThe right way to treat people\n\n01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.840\nWhat happens to your skin?\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.760\nLike when you say\n\n01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:11.800\nYou're atheist like to the world like what what happens? Well, I'm dark skin. I'm Jew\n\n01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.440\nso\n\n01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.240\nI used to be white then I became super atheist\n\n01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:27.000\nAnd then this happened I will say I mean I won't say I'm atheist or not because\n\n01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:34.280\nPeople would have a weird reaction to it and I want to be careful, but for me if you\n\n01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:38.120\nIf you do a thought experiment and you're like there's no religion\n\n01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:44.040\nThere's no it's atheism and then you look at the world from a purely atheist perspective\n\n01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:52.520\nThat is the world that makes the most sense to me like just scientifically from the things we understand and know\n\n01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:59.080\nThat's the version that seems to make the most sense except that the human eye is so complicated kidding\n\n01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.120\nkidding\n\n01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:10.920\nRight, you're saying that a windstorm could come through an airplane. What is the thing or\n\n01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.880\nAirport no, it's a what's the the anti-atheist thing. It's a\n\n01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.080\nYeah, that that uh\n\n01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:23.160\nYeah, there's like a scattered graveyard of airport parts\n\n01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:29.560\nIn this story and oh god and then the idea that the wind would come and then it would just magically create this air\n\n01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:36.600\nWell, but there's logic to try to prove what the thing is they go like how come when I open peanut butter, there's no ants in it\n\n01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.280\nright\n\n01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:44.040\nWhat who told you that would well the plane thing doesn't make sense because it's evolution so there were\n\n01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:49.720\nMillions of other planes that didn't get made and they're just like I mean waiting on a seat\n\n01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.360\nYou can't tell us that we want you to know you don't have to\n\n01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:58.760\nLike I'm like marveling at the like those guys are like look doesn't it seem like the banana was meant to fit in a hand?\n\n01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.600\nAtheist wears nightmare\n\n01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.680\nYeah, they have videos like that\n\n01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:11.960\nAnd there's a guy that like takes you through the banana the added irony by the way forget the fact that monkeys came after bananas\n\n01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:13.720\nbut\n\n01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:19.960\nUm, just the added irony that the banana he's holding is the result of a post human genetic like uh\n\n01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:25.560\nExperiment like there's no banana that ever looked like that before we invented fucking DNA manipulation\n\n01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.160\nLook, it's a whole fruit. That's a handle. That means there's a god\n\n01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:36.360\nAnd the extra irony is he keeps demonstrating how to eat the banana and how natural is so he just like it looks so I'm sure it's his nightmare\n\n01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.520\nHow gay he looks he's got this spray on tan and he's like I need to go like this\n\n01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:45.160\nIsn't this great? Oh great. And then the the guy next to him's like, yeah, that's great. Ha those atheists are\n\n01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:49.880\nAre really crying right now anything shaped like this is god's answer\n\n01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.080\nPut it in your mouth\n\n01:07:53.800 --> 01:08:01.080\nAnd there's like I my favorite thing is when people get upset that when they get insulted at the notion\n\n01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:08.040\nThat of evolution when they're like, they're trying to um say that we came from monkeys. I didn't we didn't come\n\n01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.200\nThey're not saying like your dad\n\n01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:16.040\nFuck the monkey really. Yeah, why how come if you stay at the zoo long enough, you don't see a person all of a sudden going\n\n01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.040\nLet me out of here. Yeah\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nWhy doesn't that ever happen? We've had zoos for 700 years. You know, I seriously watch playing into the apes backwards\n\n01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.400\nThat'll explain everything\n\n01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:35.480\nThere was this I read that the school had this creation science fair and the person who came in the first place put like glass jar\n\n01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:41.400\nPut sand and rocks inside it and sealed it and a couple weeks later. Nothing. It evolves. So evolution disproved\n\n01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.960\nBut I thought it'd be so awesome if they pull it out and there's like a little giraffe in there\n\n01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:55.880\nOh, fuck. Well, the the crazy thing is that the scientific version of what we're talking about almost disturbing like operans hypothesis was like\n\n01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.600\nlike like didn't didn't operan like take a\n\n01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.240\ntank full of like\n\n01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.240\nprimordial kind of like like\n\n01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.920\nThe shit that would exist in the in the beginning when and like\n\n01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:13.400\nPut electric currents through it to simulate like lightning and and simulated like\n\n01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:21.000\nThe the real jar of peanut butter that would have a giraffe in it and the the actual scientific giraffe did like come out of nowhere\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.480\nIs this the guy from the 20s though? Uh, yeah, I think\n\n01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.720\nWait, who's discredited though?\n\n01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.960\nBecause they couldn't find um\n\n01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:30.280\nHe lost all his uh\n\n01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:32.920\nUh, or he's a place caught on fire\n\n01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:37.880\nUh, one of his labs or something. That was the frog guy. I think I know you're that's what I'm thinking. Yeah\n\n01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.800\nI wonder if that's the same guy. I really thought you said operas hypothesis\n\n01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.520\nWelcome to my new science podcast. We should look this up later\n\n01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:53.560\nIf you're joining us you're on a device that gives you more information than we have\n\n01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.200\nWell, we're just gonna talk about it\n\n01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:01.400\nBut yeah, I thought yeah, I remember learning in high school operas hypothesis is locked in my head is like, holy shit\n\n01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:05.240\nThere's a certain kind of like a manner of shit. It wasn't like it wasn't like a giraffe\n\n01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:12.360\nIt wasn't even a cell or even a strand of RNA, but it was like an amino acid or a protein or something like spontaneously assembled itself\n\n01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:17.720\nSo it was like non-living to living is basically what you're saying is that what is no not non-living to living\n\n01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:22.120\nBut non-living to a building building block of future living's kind of stuff\n\n01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:27.880\nSure, sure, but but but but as David says because you should probably check in if you if the last science fact\n\n01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.640\nYou knew is from high school on your 42 years old. That's a lot\n\n01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.200\nThere's different number of planets in my solar system since when I went to high school\n\n01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.600\nSo David, I know you did you graciously got off a plane and came over here\n\n01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:43.240\nSo we don't want to keep you but is there any are there any?\n\n01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:48.920\nI don't know like while you have the attention of hundreds and hundreds of people that love you\n\n01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:55.480\nUh anything else you need to plug or uh or say plant in their heads. I would not debase myself\n\n01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.240\nAfter this\n\n01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:01.240\nHeady intellectual discussion\n\n01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:06.280\nI thought it was really nice. I I I hope you I hope you had a good enough time that you'd like to come back at some point\n\n01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.360\nYeah, absolutely. Yeah, people here really\n\n01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:18.360\nThank you. All right, javid prash ladies and gentlemen\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.360\nDan I sat right next to him like a weirdo. I missed him\n\n01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:32.600\nRemember when david was here? Yeah. Yeah, that was fun. Yeah\n\n01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.320\nAre you are you taking a dig at me? No\n\n01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:41.080\nOh, wait, how am I taking a dig at you because you because he stepped off the stage and you immediately started missing him\n\n01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.160\nI'm the only one left. I\n\n01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.520\nknow\n\n01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.480\nNot a dig no now suddenly people understood\n\n01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:53.160\nNow they think it's a dig. It was never a no no there what they started understanding is how fucked up. I am. Yes\n\n01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.720\nThey went whoa, that's a pretzel brain\n\n01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:01.480\nI always think there's a video with that banana thing. That's yes. It's amazing\n\n01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.560\nWhenever people are like, well, this is proof of a benevolent god. I'm always like, yeah\n\n01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:12.520\nBut there's also fucking tigers around, you know, those people fascinate me the most because it's like well, they're they're they have the\n\n01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.760\nThey have the easiest\n\n01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:19.720\nMove in the magic deck, which is faith. I don't care and they don't use it\n\n01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:24.040\nThey choose the logic path to be a christian and what are you doing?\n\n01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.000\nWhy are you playing basketball in skis?\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nYeah, my dad my dad who's a who I said earlier is a Baptist minister after sermons\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000\nSometimes I would see people come up to him the same way that someone would come up to\n\n01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.800\nCome on Aaron. Who's one person who is in Star Trek?\n\n01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.440\nGod damn it Aaron. Who is one actor whoopee Goldberg?\n\n01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:50.440\nCratal robber\n\n01:12:50.440 --> 01:13:00.440\nWait, why didn't you want to say a Star Trek person because because it's analogous to people who come up to\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:07.880\nActors and in Star Trek and say like hey like I was just thinking about it and and this could actually happen because I did the math and\n\n01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.440\nYou guys got to this planet at this certain speed\n\n01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:16.120\nAnd in the same way to my dad after sermons a guy would be like yeah, I took all the bees out of\n\n01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:23.240\nGenesis and I added them together and that number is the same number of days that no one had no I had lunch\n\n01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.560\nwith Sarah and\n\n01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:32.280\nSo like this stuff is totally real and I might I would be like, all right. Well, yeah, you can find patterns wherever\n\n01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:37.400\nAnd that's what I love about your dad. I know if I told like one of the tail when I was like, okay\n\n01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:42.440\nThis is my father-in-law. I'm gonna. I just have I just have to marry his daughter still\n\n01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:48.840\nUh, when you when you told me about how he was like he's a navy chaplain, but like one of his\n\n01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.560\nUh navy crewman seaman\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.600\nCrewman seaman\n\n01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:58.200\nI don't want to call someone a seaman unless I absolutely know that I'm supposed to\n\n01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.320\nThey call him the jizz boys\n\n01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:04.840\nOne of his jizz boys\n\n01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:10.760\nHis jizz boys that's what my dad said is that one of one of the guys one of the guys within his flock was a\n\n01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:16.920\nScientologist and so he had a stat he went out and bought Scientology books. He's a he's a Baptist\n\n01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.920\nUh, uh preacher. He he's he's fine with gay marriage\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.240\nHe he has to go up against his own congregation sometimes in the powers that be above him\n\n01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:29.720\nBut in addition to that he's like he's he knows that his role is to like like these are\n\n01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:35.800\nThese are soldiers and they're in a time of crisis no matter what and like like my job is to like\n\n01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.160\nYou know\n\n01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:41.800\nBe there for any kind of like emergency. I need spiritually and like he read\n\n01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:50.360\nScientology books so that in a pinch if somebody that is the one Scientologist aboard got his pinky stuck in a in a canon door\n\n01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.760\nHe'd be like, oh\n\n01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.760\nMixo plicks, please help me\n\n01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.240\nAnd your dad would be like, I know what he means\n\n01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:58.600\nYeah\n\n01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.600\nMixo plicks\n\n01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.880\nYeah, my dad also carries a wand\n\n01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:08.280\nUh, some of you Scientologists in the audience may have been offended by my\n\n01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.960\ndepiction of your religion\n\n01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.800\nUh\n\n01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.480\nOkay, so well, yeah, I mean we're we're we're on a we're on a bullet train here.

Let's bring out the jizz boys\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:30.280\nThe jizz boys, let's we're gonna bring out uh game master spencer crittenden\n\n01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:47.400\nAnd uh, he was with us last time when we're creating our characters that he's still here. I'm assuming he's coming up DeMorge Brown\n\n01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:53.400\nDown town DeMorge Brown we call him\n\n01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:00.280\nBecause there's another DeMorge Brown who uh, does like\n\n01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.520\nSo downtown DeMorge Brown is the vj version\n\n01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:08.120\nDoing references from 1982\n\n01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:14.840\nYou will get them if you go home and ask your parents for the vcr in their floorboards\n\n01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.840\nWhen I was a kid\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.560\nThere was a kid a kid named Wesley brown who was bigger than I was and had a bald head\n\n01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:28.040\nAnd glasses and he used to say downtown DeMorge Brown every time I came in the room\n\n01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:32.840\nThat sounds like an oracle. There was a difference. You liked that though, right? Like that sounds nice\n\n01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:37.960\nHe did that to everybody. He was like a like a basketball announcer sort of uh, but he didn't well, okay\n\n01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:42.680\nAll right. Yeah, I guess that that that that that uh, I enjoy the lies the illusion\n\n01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:46.200\nI think downtown julie brown missing for a while\n\n01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:52.280\nBut they found her in the uh least likely of places. Yeah uptown\n\n01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:05.080\nIt's the story everyone's talking about a celebrity disappears with a nomenclature old twist\n\n01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:17.640\nUm, yes downtown julie brown, um, I wonder how that works. Remember julie. Does anybody just remember remember julie brown the non downtown julie brown?\n\n01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:21.240\nYeah, she just did a comedy show in los filos a couple weeks ago\n\n01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.440\nIn the character of julie brown\n\n01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:30.840\nWhich I was very confused by because I thought that was her but she said I'm doing a show in the character of julie brown\n\n01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:33.960\nDid she like write earth girls are easy or would she just in it?\n\n01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:36.520\nI don't know. She was very creatively active\n\n01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:43.400\nBack before there was an internet to be like kind of fringy, but also funny as she was she was a hero to some people\n\n01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:47.320\nUh, should have her on the show talk to her about about about\n\n01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.560\nLooking at jeff gold blooms. Like do you ever see do you ever see earth girls are easy?\n\n01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.960\nI've seen the cover of the tape. I watched the last christmas.

Thank you\n\n01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.320\nSo\n\n01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:08.360\nCan you follow me around in my life so I can pick up a shoe and I'd be like lunch and you'd be like no, that's not lunch\n\n01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.440\nAaron\n\n01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.600\nDamon Wayans is in it though, right?\n\n01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:19.240\nIsn't Damon Wayans. Yes. Yes. Damon Wayans jim carrey and jeff goldbloom and it's half of aliens that come that are like like\n\n01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:24.360\nhairy furry alien people that descend on the valley and oh my god\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.200\nThe only earthlings that they meet are like these valley girls\n\n01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:33.400\nWhich was like a thing and then they shave them and they're like, oh my god, you're totally hot underneath all that fur\n\n01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.320\nWhat did they shave on them?\n\n01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:39.080\nTheir bodies they have like red and yellow or even they shave the girls\n\n01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:42.920\nNo, no, no god. No the girls don't have fur all over them\n\n01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:47.640\nThe the aliens do and they shave them and they look like the girls do have fur all over them\n\n01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:51.160\nBut they've been conditioned by society to take care of that before it becomes the aliens problem\n\n01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:56.760\nWhen they're fat like jim carrey's great, they're different colors. Yeah, they're like\n\n01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:04.440\nDifferent teletubbies almost like these live bodies. It's a it's a it's a it's an interesting movie in a world where uh, yeah\n\n01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:05.720\nlike\n\n01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:07.720\nYeah, I don't know kids should watch it\n\n01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.520\nZardaz hudson hawk\n\n01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.400\nWatch watch watch movies that kind of\n\n01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:18.840\nYou know, what is it? I is the title ironic earth girls not actually easy\n\n01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.880\nI don't know they were in that movie. They were easy\n\n01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:25.800\nHuh, I think I think the title obviously just bridges\n\n01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:31.560\nAt the time an ironic coupling which is sci-fi with sexual sounds like a movie that was written after somebody said\n\n01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.720\nWe should have a movie called earth girls are easy\n\n01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.440\nI think it might have been based on a julie brown novelty song, frankly\n\n01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:44.600\nI don't know if she made that because she was yeah, look it up google it again. Thank you. Thank you for coming to pop culture\n\n01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.560\nWe'll look it up later\n\n01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.960\nSpencer is here. Yeah\n\n01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.960\nYeah\n\n01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.040\nThanks audience I needed that\n\n01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:02.120\nSo I got a weird anecdote. I got a share. Okay, so I hang out with my friend matt landsman\n\n01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:07.640\nHe's a friend of mine and I've I've had the convention of when I enter the room\n\n01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.720\nI have a wireless jam box speaker\n\n01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:17.160\nWhen I when I enter the room I I play I play the john sena theme song right as I open the door\n\n01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:21.640\nI I hope you guys know the theme song anyway the the other night\n\n01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:25.400\nI was at my friend matt's house and his roommate was just coming home and\n\n01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:31.320\nAnd I didn't have the song quite queued up and we all realized what had to happen\n\n01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.800\nI had to get the song queued up before he got in the house\n\n01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.960\nAnd no one knew how that was going to happen\n\n01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:39.080\nSo I was like lock the door and my friend runs and does that chain\n\n01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:42.040\nYou know the chain where you yeah locks the door like that\n\n01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:45.400\nAnd I'm queuing up the song. I got it. It starts playing\n\n01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:51.080\nYou know it takes about six seconds to really kick in and like as right as the guy is going up\n\n01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:57.400\nPart like the the roommate literally kicks the in the door\n\n01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.320\nAnd enters the room right as john sena is like\n\n01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.440\nIt was amazing and horrifying\n\n01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:12.040\nThat's the culmination of that whole\n\n01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:18.440\nYou can never play that song. I know it's it's ruined now. Yeah to destroy property to play the song\n\n01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:24.440\nThat story requires familiarity with that song for sure. Yeah, I wish I kind of wanted to lock on\n\n01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:27.000\nOtherwise it's just a story that your friend came home and kicked in the door\n\n01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:33.560\nYeah, you need to know the song, but I feel confident that most everyone has heard that song before so\n\n01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:39.160\nWell, I I don't know the song, but I really got the story. I was there with you\n\n01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:46.440\nWell, I was you got to listen to the song man john sena theme song on google third video result down\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:55.560\nI know how to get it if I pop if I type j o into uh into google it says john sena theme song\n\n01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.880\nI think that's just you Spencer. Oh, no, I know it's that's what I'm saying. It's I do that so often\n\n01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:07.800\nIt's it's two letters for me.

So I go in the bathroom and I swear to God even though it seems like a really dumb sit-com pitch or like like not even\n\n01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:13.160\nBecause it looks like like I but I like I'm listening to her watching 2001\n\n01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:16.280\nBecause I didn't want to pause it because I didn't want silence while I did this\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nYeah, I'm listening to it and I'm turned the volume up because then she knows so my only choice is I'm waiting\n\n01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.800\nfor the spake there Sarah thruster\n\n01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:30.440\nTo crescendo.

Yeah, I thought it was like you you you make me want to be a better person\n\n01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:23.800\nYou make the dark parts of me flee\n\n01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:29.800\nI mean, you know, it's interesting. I I had your explanation to think about mine\n\n01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:41.400\nI thought it meant that like in a relationship you lose yourself. So you make your shadow run. You don't see yourself anymore. You just like\n\n01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:49.240\nYou're absorbed. Oh, you lose the self in a way that that's selfless. Wow this wait, what do you mean? Wait, I didn't get that\n\n01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.040\nshadow run\n\n01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:59.080\nWell, you see your shadow you see you see yourself you see your reflection of yourself you make my shadow run\n\n01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:04.200\nI like what you are so much and I am at such a deficit as a person that you make my shadow run\n\n01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:09.480\nI'm just you now. I am going to be absorbed. Oh, I thought it's a more positive thing in that you're not\n\n01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:13.800\nYou're not obsessed with yourself and the way you were before now\n\n01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.800\nThere's someone else that you care for\n\n01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:22.280\nAnd so you're not just self-reflexive all right. You're okay. No, wait a second. That's a better way to look at\n\n01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:27.000\nI thought I mean obviously you've been joking around\n\n01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:35.800\nI thought it's it's from uh from 12 o'clock in the afternoon until just about five o'clock\n\n01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:44.440\nDuring the spring and fall and then uh, but time it time goes quicker. So your shadow actually a long\n\n01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.320\nTime goes by like a long time with you\n\n01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:53.400\nYou made my shadow run. Oh, that's beautiful. That's beautiful\n\n01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:58.040\nYeah, I just saw an older guy who looked a lot like my dad and wore blue jeans and\n\n01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:04.920\nWould walk along the roadside at like one o'clock in the morning singing to himself. That one's wrong. That one's wrong\n\n01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.800\nThe exception that proves the rule classic dad\n\n01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:16.920\nI know that the I think I think I think what this song has going for it is that sun rhymes with run\n\n01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:19.960\nAnd the sun makes a shadow go away\n\n01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:24.200\nI like the sundial theory, which is what I'm calling david's\n\n01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:27.800\nI think the sun makes the shadow show up. I don't\n\n01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.520\nNo, no, no, no, no\n\n01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:38.200\nAt 12 noon, there's no shadow because the sun is I tried to block myself from everything in your sun\n\n01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:40.600\nBut in the end\n\n01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:42.600\nbaby, you make my shadow\n\n01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:46.040\nall right like\n\n01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.840\nLike it you you you move through the sky and the\n\n01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:52.200\nLike you no matter I no matter how hard I try\n\n01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.840\nYou move through the sky\n\n01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:57.160\nAnd and make my darkness come undone\n\n01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:00.440\nYou make my shadow look you make my shadow\n\n01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:04.200\nFrom nine to five. I got a plier in my hand and I\n\n01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:12.440\nWhat is that job? That's just blue collar flavor like a little a little fun fun fact is uh\n\n01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:18.360\nUh, he recorded that he recorded that with over 30. I think it was 32 different tools\n\n01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:30.680\nHuey Lewis's song when he's like milwaukey like yeah, the hard-o rock and roll seattle\n\n01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:36.200\nWell, honey, that's our city.

Is he in our radio?\n\n01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:41.640\nI\n\n01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:48.120\nI have that shadow wrongs run song stuck in my head now for real\n\n01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:54.680\nI block your light, but when the day is done\n\n01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:59.160\nBaby you make my shadow\n\n01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.880\nMy shadow\n\n01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:12.120\nThat's a duet from the tv movie, but in the morning the light comes again\n\n01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:16.120\nAll right, so\n\n01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.640\nSo you do know what shadow run is\n\n01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:29.640\nI was just gonna say that's gonna make everything a lot easier now. We are all on the same page\n\n01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:31.640\nI\n\n01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:38.440\nI was so hoping you were just stewing there. You're like this is a serious thing and you're about to snap\n\n01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:41.960\nThat is not what shadow run is guys\n\n01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:46.280\nSomebody worked hard on this\n\n01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.320\nI mean\n\n01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.800\nNot even in a joke in all seriousness\n\n01:33:53.800 --> 01:34:00.840\nI've encountered like seven of those kinds of shadow run enthusiasts already and I'm getting kind of sick of that so\n\n01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:04.920\nPeople who are like two and do it. Yeah, I'm gonna lean in that other direction\n\n01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:08.920\nI mean when you're talking about fairies and shit, you can't take yourself seriously\n\n01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.120\nThat's what the irish do\n\n01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.640\nLook what it got him\n\n01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:23.240\nThat brings the whole theme into it both gay rights and religious\n\n01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:28.600\nTransparency. Yeah, it's like well, don't cry. I'm not archie bunker. I'm just saying like\n\n01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:34.280\nLike like like yeah, if you take anything too seriously, you lose you lose your shadow\n\n01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:40.520\nI thought when he like irish fairies you were trying to connect those two\n\n01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:42.040\nYeah\n\n01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:47.880\nLike what if what if yeah, what if the irish believed in fairies so much that they that when they when you flew air lingus\n\n01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:50.200\nIf an irish guy got on the plane, he was like, I'm sorry\n\n01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.160\nThat person's got salt on their shoe\n\n01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:57.800\nWe wouldn't tolerate it from them\n\n01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:02.040\nAir lingus sounds really sexual it does. Yeah\n\n01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:04.040\nYeah\n\n01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:06.040\nThat joy of that\n\n01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:11.000\nBut there's no fairies in shadow run world, right? It's like a cyberpunk\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.240\nNo, I mean there's orcs and elves and shit. I don't think there's fairies necessarily. Yeah, come on man\n\n01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:18.360\nThere are no fairies\n\n01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:21.800\nBut it's like technology base. I did read the elves\n\n01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:26.280\nContract the one of those viruses they could turn into a banshee and I know that a banshee is a\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nfairy. Yep\n\n01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:32.680\nShit yeah marveling I\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.280\nI will I will take that sound at face value. You are marveling at me\n\n01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:40.920\nAs people don't laugh when evil can evil makes a landing like\n\n01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:43.640\nI know that sound was\n\n01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:45.480\nYou were breathless\n\n01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:54.440\nShadowrunner is like dnd if trolls had pink mohawks and spray paint and ipad spray paint the the hallmark of technology\n\n01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:02.280\nBut but yes\n\n01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:07.000\nThat's true though. Yeah aliens are gonna come and be like these guys and oh they have spray paint cannons\n\n01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.720\nLeave them alone\n\n01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:15.320\nYour paint ain't confined to just a can and a brush it's in the air\n\n01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:21.880\nWhat air doesn't rhyme with shadow run\n\n01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.400\nIt's not going to no matter how long we wait\n\n01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:34.440\nSo what what is uh shout you everyone's familiar with no, I don't I don't think anyone's familiar with it\n\n01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:39.720\nIt's a it's a role-playing game in which like collectively we tell a story together\n\n01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:44.760\nWhere these guys play as characters. I know that's your justification for playing it. So what is\n\n01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:48.280\nOh, no\n\n01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.800\nThat one cut a little deep\n\n01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:55.640\nUh, yeah, you don't get rid of the rumble\n\n01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:00.760\nIt's it's uh, but it's like uh\n\n01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:02.840\nIt's like uh\n\n01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:08.280\nDungeons and dragons where there's a there's a it's a story but the the context is different, but it's the same\n\n01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:14.440\nIt's a different world. It's not as sort of sorcery. It's more technology and magic in the future\n\n01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:20.680\nLaser is and spray paint. Yeah, it's like a dystopian earth. So technology is like where uh, and I'm\n\n01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:21.640\nI'm\n\n01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:23.240\nLiterally, I'm not trying to be funny\n\n01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:28.840\nBut no where the where you'd have a spell that would do a certain thing now you have technology that does a certain thing\n\n01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:32.680\nWell, it's actually both so you got like you got your guys who cast magic\n\n01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:36.600\nBut then you also have guys who you know just have guns and robot parts that\n\n01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:38.920\nWow\n\n01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:42.920\nDavid David David you said you weren't\n\n01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:47.640\nToo much\n\n01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:54.520\nAnd hacking it's a lot to digest. I think he's got he's got a good grasp on it. It's it's it's uh, it's it's it's uh,\n\n01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:57.080\nif like uh\n\n01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:04.440\nWilliam Gibson's future, uh, or blade runner like if the in the midst of blade runner then someone said, ah, there's elves now\n\n01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.200\nIt's dystopian hobbit. It's a mishmash\n\n01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:14.600\nYeah, no, that's a good way of putting it. It's just distilled. It is just like blade runner except also magic\n\n01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.160\nIt seems like it seems like lazy writing. Okay\n\n01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:25.240\nYeah, it's how you get around like how are they gonna be out of magic so they can do whatever the fuck they want\n\n01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:29.960\nIt's like the giant eagles and the hobbit. Anyway, uh, we don't have to get into it\n\n01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:35.000\nAre you are you a d&d guy? Uh, I don't really know it. I just know it from playing here\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000\nI love like fantasy stuff. But do you like sci-fi stuff? Do you like like blade runner and shit like that?\n\n01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.600\nI like blade runner, uh, I don't I don't\n\n01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:44.200\ndon't some science fiction stuff\n\n01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:50.120\nI I do but as as a I'm not drawn to the genre like other people are you only like the best examples of it probably\n\n01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:54.040\nJust good. Yeah. Yeah, good I'm fine with good\n\n01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:58.440\nThere just isn't a lot of good\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:04.360\nAnd since the first the first edition of chat around was introduced in 1987. Is that right?\n\n01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.480\nI think yeah\n\n01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:11.000\nFor a while, but they there were now in the fifth edition\n\n01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.000\nYeah, meanwhile, we can't get somebody to take another pass at the Quran.\n\n01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000\nWe've got...\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000\nI should stop saying that.\n\n01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000\nBefore it becomes your catchphrase.\n\n01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000\nIt won't be it for very long.\n\n01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000\nI'll get heptode.\n\n01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000\nWhat?\n\n01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000\nI can say it.\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.000\nHe's right. He didn't make the rules.\n\n01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000\nHe's just riding him across the finish line.\n\n01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.000\nSo, yeah, I mean,\n\n01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000\noriginally we were going to present characters,\n\n01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000\nyou know, even if, you know,\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000\nthat might take the whole time we have left.\n\n01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000\nBut let's present the characters, right?\n\n01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.000\nSo, I could pass these out.\n\n01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.000\nI'll do that. Make funnies.\n\n01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000\nShadow.\n\n01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000\nDo you make the characters or are the characters part of the game?\n\n01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000\nWe consulted with him because it's a new game with a new milieu.\n\n01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000\nSo we talked last episode about the kinds of characters we'd like to play.\n\n01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000\nAnd so there's been a sort of interplay between Spencer doing, arguably,\n\n01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:30.000\nprobably the hardest, most joyless work of, like, rolling our characters.\n\n01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000\nYeah, but the guys like that love that shit.\n\n01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000\nI hate it.\n\n01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000\nI love it.\n\n01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.000\nI really, it took me about a combined 16 hours for all of these.\n\n01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000\nIt was, it was not...\n\n01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000\nYeah, you got something to do. Great.\n\n01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000\nAll right.\n\n01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000\nThat's true, though.\n\n01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000\nI was actually at work not doing anything during those 16 hours.\n\n01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000\nBut you love doing it. You get joy from it, right?\n\n01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000\nThis isn't a war.\n\n01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.000\nI mean, there's, joy happens at some point in the equation.\n\n01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000\nSure, there's joy.\n\n01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000\nI mean, there was joy.\n\n01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000\nSo, David, what it is, is there'll be, like, different races you can choose from, like, or...\n\n01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000\nIt's a pencil, Dan.\n\n01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:18.000\nOr, like, wizards or hackers or whatever it is, so we all...\n\n01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.000\nYeah, I made, you know, folders for everyone.\n\n01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.000\nThere's a lot of bullets in this game, so you really need to be marking your own inventory and shit.\n\n01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000\nI would say the thread that the pencil is attached to is really above and beyond.\n\n01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000\nYeah.\n\n01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000\nThat's because you guys are going to lose them.\n\n01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000\nI feel like I'm at a bank.\n\n01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000\nI mean...\n\n01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000\nI don't want to lose these things.\n\n01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000\nNo, thank you.\n\n01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000\nYou take them home otherwise or something. I don't know.\n\n01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000\nNo, this is...\n\n01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000\nI can't just buy pencils every day.\n\n01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000\nThat's great, so let's talk about these guys.\n\n01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000\nYeah, let's...\n\n01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000\nSo I, can we start with my guy?\n\n01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000\nYeah, do you know about your guy?\n\n01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000\nI actually sent you an email about him. I don't know if you read it.\n\n01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000\nOh, yeah, I...\n\n01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000\nI read mine.\n\n01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000\nYeah.\n\n01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000\nNo, so assume I didn't read it.\n\n01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000\nOkay, well, I'll just pull up this email I sent you.\n\n01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000\nAll right.\n\n01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000\nWhat email address did you send it to? Do not say that.\n\n01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:28.000\nIt's karanreboot at AOL.com.\n\n01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000\nAll right, well, all read...\n\n01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:39.000\nIt's your new gimmick. You're the Yakov Smirnov of...\n\n01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000\nI'm really pushing for the rewrite of the Koran.\n\n01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000\nThat's my stance.\n\n01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.000\nSo if you haven't read yours, let's not start with yours.\n\n01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000\nLet's start with Dan or something.\n\n01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000\nDan or something?\n\n01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000\nAnd then I could do it.\n\n01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000\nI could read it, but not the first one.\n\n01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000\nLet Dan start off.\n\n01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000\nWait, you want me to...\n\n01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000\nTell us about your character.\n\n01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000\nDon't read your sheet. It's about your background and stuff.\n\n01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000\nOkay, yeah, well, I just want to ask this.\n\n01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000\nMy character, it feels like he's...\n\n01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000\nI don't know how much stuff the other people should know,\n\n01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000\nbut do you think I should just let it all out?\n\n01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000\nYeah, I mean, let it all out.\n\n01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000\nThey're skilled professionals.\n\n01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000\nI think if anything you say that's secret,\n\n01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000\nthey can pretend it's secret.\n\n01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:33.000\nOkay, so my character was born James Gundram III\n\n01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:39.000\nin Wisconsin in 2034.\n\n01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:46.000\nAnd his dad was a prominent member\n\n01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.000\nof the anti-meta-human hate group.\n\n01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.000\nHumanitous...\n\n01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000\nHumanus populi, I think.\n\n01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000\nWhat was it?\n\n01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000\nPopuli?\n\n01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.000\nThey're kind of a Ku Klux Klan of when people started\n\n01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:06.000\nturning into elves and stuff.\n\n01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000\nThere was a human...\n\n01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000\nBut the uplifting thing is that black people\n\n01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000\ncould be in this group and hate goblins.\n\n01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000\nIt was great.\n\n01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000\nIt's just when you think you're going to achieve everything\n\n01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000\nthat's like...\n\n01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000\nIt's a whole new way to hate people.\n\n01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.000\nSo my dad was like a founding member,\n\n01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.000\nkind of a thug, an arsonist assassin within that group.\n\n01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.000\nAnd he taught me how to fight and how to be scrappy,\n\n01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000\nbut also I was smart and I could talk\n\n01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000\nso they thought let's send him to the academy\n\n01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000\nto be a lone star officer.\n\n01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000\nA lone star is sort of a police force\n\n01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000\nthat services a lot of the city-states in the future.\n\n01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000\nMaybe he could eventually be a politician or something\n\n01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000\nand he could make our horrible racist cause\n\n01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000\nlike a law.\n\n01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000\nPut it into legislation.\n\n01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000\nAnd then I went to school and I fell in love\n\n01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.000\nwith an elf girl.\n\n01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.000\nAnd then I begged my dad to reconsider his ways,\n\n01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000\nbut he couldn't.\n\n01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000\nAnd as I was attempting to flee the state with her,\n\n01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000\nshe was killed under mysterious circumstances.\n\n01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000\nAnd I blamed my father for it\n\n01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.000\nand signed on with the lone star security services\n\n01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000\nunder the condition that my dad would be among those put away\n\n01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000\nwhen I infiltrated this horrible hate group.\n\n01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000\nAnd so I did all that.\n\n01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000\nAnd then because I needed my identity wiped\n\n01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000\nbecause I betrayed everybody I knew at that job,\n\n01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000\nthen I just became this horrible,\n\n01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000\nlike the government just used me and sent me to every city\n\n01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000\nand made me change my name every time\n\n01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000\nand taught me how to do that.\n\n01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000\nAnd I would just narc on and like shadow runners\n\n01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000\nlike in every city.\n\n01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.000\nAnd then I found out my dad didn't actually kill my girlfriend.\n\n01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.000\nLike I think actually the cops did to make me available\n\n01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000\nfor that employment opportunity.\n\n01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000\nCause you're such a good cop.\n\n01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000\nWell, cause they were like,\n\n01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.000\nboy, this guy's going to be amazing if we just kill his girlfriend.\n\n01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000\nGive him the right motivation.\n\n01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000\nHis family is so racist.\n\n01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000\nHe'll think this is a fucking, this is not a seven 10 split.\n\n01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000\nI don't know what the opposite of that is.\n\n01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000\nRemember, I'm from Wisconsin.\n\n01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.000\nOkay, so it's all bowling analogies.\n\n01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000\nYeah.\n\n01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000\nI like it.\n\n01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000\nSo then I was betrayed by the people that owned me\n\n01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000\nand like they used me to do shitty stuff.\n\n01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000\nI was like a narc and I believed in it\n\n01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000\nand now I don't believe in it.\n\n01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000\nAnd so I had to escape with my life\n\n01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000\ncause they were going to kill me.\n\n01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:32.000\nAnd I used the most, the only identity I had that no one knew about\n\n01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000\nwhich was a generic identity pulled from like a textbook in the academy.\n\n01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000\nSo my name is Jim Nightblade.\n\n01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:47.000\nA former cop trapped in the life of the crime he used to fight.\n\n01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000\nThat's a pitch.\n\n01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.000\nMotherfucker, everything I do is a pitch.\n\n01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.000\nWhat if this microphone had to hang out with an anti-phone?\n\n01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000\nOkay, great. Aaron.\n\n01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000\nI don't know why I affected an urban dialect.\n\n01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000\nAnti-phone?\n\n01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.000\nI found that email Spencer, it reminds me of going to my spam.\n\n01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.000\nBut I have it and I can read it, but you guys go first.\n\n01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000\nSpencer, you came up with all the stuff, right?\n\n01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000\nNo, he came up with his, Aaron came up with her backstory\n\n01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.000\nand then I came up with DeMorge and Coomale's backstory because, yeah.\n\n01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000\nNot nerds.\n\n01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000\nThis is fascinating.\n\n01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:43.000\nI can't, I've never seen anything from this side where you're telling the story\n\n01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000\nand people are like, oh.\n\n01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000\nLike the thing where when you said he, and I found out my dad didn't kill my girl.\n\n01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.000\nNo, when you said that my dad killed my girlfriend, there were people here who were like, oh.\n\n01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.000\nYeah, but you've seen, that's just the power of like an audience's grace when they're like,\n\n01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000\noh, we trust you and know you like, you, you listen.\n\n01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000\nThat was, no, that was honest, that wasn't, there was nothing.\n\n01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000\nWhen you listen to Prairie Home Companion, like Gears and Keeler goes like,\n\n01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:16.000\nand then the blueberry pie, paddle, boop-a-doop-a-doo, and everyone goes like, ah.\n\n01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000\nJoe went fishing for the first time in six months.\n\n01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000\nIt's called Stockholm Syndrome.\n\n01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000\nIf I don't like my coffee this morning, Munich's gonna go bad.\n\n01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000\nOkay.\n\n01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000\nOut to your Ubers.\n\n01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000\nIf we're not gonna have a sh-\n\n01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000\nOut to your Ubers.\n\n01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000\nOut to your Ubers.\n\n01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000\nAlright, so my character is named Mercy O'Donnell,\n\n01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:47.000\nand I'll just read the short email that I sent Spencer earlier today.\n\n01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000\nIt's a historical hostage event.\n\n01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000\nWell within my right to use that to illustrate.\n\n01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000\nSorry.\n\n01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000\nMade a movie about it for kids.\n\n01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000\nYeah, Munich was for kids.\n\n01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.000\nAlright, this is Mercy O'Donnell.\n\n01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:13.000\nFormer publicist for Ares Macro Technology, an ex-wife of its CEO, Damian Knight,\n\n01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:19.000\nMercy O'Donnell is a madam for megacorporations and the underground alike.\n\n01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:24.000\nTwo years ago, Mercy left her husband after he beat their teenage son to death in an argument.\n\n01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:33.000\nWhen she fled, when she fled Ares Macro Technology manipulated evidence at the scene,\n\n01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:40.000\nand the corporate court charged Mercy with a murder as a madam, Mercy, so she's on the run.\n\n01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:47.000\nAs a madam, Mercy works almost exclusively with magic users who may or may not procure payment\n\n01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:53.000\nwithout quote-unquote natural sexual services rendered, regardless her Johns always leave happy.\n\n01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:59.000\nWith a name that is always changing, she is known by her many contacts as the eyes,\n\n01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:03.000\nbecause I have the best face ever, is the thing that was established before.\n\n01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000\nI'm looking at David.\n\n01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000\nAnd you're a hooker.\n\n01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000\nYou're a prostitute?\n\n01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000\nUh, no.\n\n01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:15.000\nNo, I'm a madam, but I work mostly with magic users.\n\n01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000\nI work mostly with people who are able-\n\n01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000\nWhat does madam mean?\n\n01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.000\nWhat is a madam?\n\n01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000\nLike a prostitute king?\n\n01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000\nOh, yeah, like a prostitute king.\n\n01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.000\nKing of all the prostitutes, that's true.\n\n01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:38.000\nThe first conversation between the worst representatives of an indigenous and an invading population.\n\n01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000\nThat's their tatanka.\n\n01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000\nIn a way.\n\n01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000\nHow do whores work?\n\n01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000\nYou need a king of whores?\n\n01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:52.000\nYes.\n\n01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000\nYeah, so I'm working as a madam, but that's my cover.\n\n01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.000\nBut Camille, a madam is somebody who's like an agent for prostitutes.\n\n01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000\nIt's like CAA for prostitutes.\n\n01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000\nOh, you're the CAA of prostitutes?\n\n01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.000\nI thought CAA was the CAA of prostitutes.\n\n01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:18.000\nYou know in the movies when you run into a brothel, and then there's like, there's all of the sad, broken-hearted, carnival-\n\n01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000\nThere's a woman who's just turned 35.\n\n01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:24.000\nYeah, there's the milf who's eight years younger than me.\n\n01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:29.000\nBut I am more a madam as a cover.\n\n01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:37.000\nI don't know how much I should say about my character, but she's fiercely anti-male.\n\n01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000\nAnd the way that that's...\n\n01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000\nShocker.\n\n01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000\nWell, why is that? What?\n\n01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000\nI mean, you're just saying that. That doesn't mean anything.\n\n01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:49.000\nYou can say shocker after almost anything. Try it tonight, kids, as you go home.\n\n01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000\nIt's a button.\n\n01:51:51.000 --> 01:52:00.000\nMaybe because she watched her husband, whom she loved when they got married, kill her son.\n\n01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000\nSo she has like an imbalanced hatred.\n\n01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:07.000\nBut the son is also male, so why is she a male hater?\n\n01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000\nWell, I mean, sometimes hatred doesn't make sense.\n\n01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000\nRight.\n\n01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:18.000\nShe's afraid of men, and now she's wanting to protect women.\n\n01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.000\nBut God, she has this face.\n\n01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000\nShe's got a great face.\n\n01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.000\nShe has a great face, but it's not for you.\n\n01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000\nWhat do you mean? Why is it not for me?\n\n01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.000\nI don't know. I'm spiraling. It's not for men.\n\n01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000\nIf I can afford it, it's for me, right?\n\n01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.000\nNo, because I am the agent.\n\n01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.000\nSorry, right.\n\n01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000\nI am the agent.\n\n01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000\nYou're the agent.\n\n01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:46.000\nBut the idea is that she is making her money by employing magic-using prostitutes,\n\n01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.000\nher convincing men that they're getting off, and they're not really.\n\n01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000\nOh.\n\n01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000\nOkay, got it, got it, got it, got it.\n\n01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:56.000\nBut maybe not exclusively.\n\n01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.000\nBeing convinced that you got off is identical.\n\n01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000\nYou're getting off.\n\n01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000\nI wouldn't even have a complaint.\n\n01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000\nWell, this is interesting.\n\n01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:09.000\nIt's different in that the girl doesn't have to put a orc dick in her mouth.\n\n01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.000\nOh, that's great for her.\n\n01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.000\nThat's like when the hotel says, we turn your lights off because the planet needs to be saved.\n\n01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000\nFine for you.\n\n01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:22.000\nI'm saying as a male customer, if you told me, listen, sorry, if you're out of...\n\n01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000\nNo, exactly.\n\n01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000\nI wouldn't demand my money back.\n\n01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000\nNo, I know.\n\n01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000\nI thought I got the best blow job ever.\n\n01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.000\nWell, that's a thing.\n\n01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000\nExcept I think egos would get in the way where guys would be like,\n\n01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.000\nI thought the best girl last night is almost like you didn't actually.\n\n01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000\nThat's the perfect scene to introduce your character in the movie version,\n\n01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000\nwhere there's a guy that's like that.\n\n01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:47.000\nBecause then you can demonstrate how you lay down the law to protect these ladies.\n\n01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000\nRight.\n\n01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000\nThat's what I like about the archetype of the hooker matron,\n\n01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000\nwho's in a world where the government doesn't care about humanity.\n\n01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.000\nThere's a woman who's like a den mother to these lost souls.\n\n01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.000\nYeah, I'm like a mother hen, but young.\n\n01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000\nAnd a great face.\n\n01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000\nAnd hotter than all of them.\n\n01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000\nHotter than all of them.\n\n01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000\nIt's like...\n\n01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000\nGot it.\n\n01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:14.000\nSo, DeMores, I don't know if you want to talk through, but I also have the write-up that I sent you,\n\n01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000\nso I can read that or you could do it.\n\n01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000\nJust to caution the audience.\n\n01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000\nYeah, I know the characters.\n\n01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000\nJust because of the bills we have to pay.\n\n01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:27.000\nDeMores' character is basically the noid from Pizza Hut.\n\n01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.000\nIt's called branded content.\n\n01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000\nThere's no commercials during the podcast.\n\n01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000\nNo, no.\n\n01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.000\nBut Pizza Hut tastes so good that we're okay.\n\n01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000\nAnd it's very cheap.\n\n01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000\nAnd it's a real thing.\n\n01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000\nI mean, it's a real thing to not want cool pizza.\n\n01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000\nI can hear you guys.\n\n01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000\nYeah, go ahead.\n\n01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000\nMy character's name is Horde God.\n\n01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000\nI'm an elf.\n\n01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000\nYou're a dwarf.\n\n01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000\nI'm a dwarf.\n\n01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000\nI was just testing you.\n\n01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000\nPeople don't know the difference these days.\n\n01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000\nMy mother was a dwarf.\n\n01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000\nMy father was a dwarf.\n\n01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:13.000\nThey were both very smart and came to the United States as a science team.\n\n01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:18.000\nI do not have the most beautiful face, but I have reasonable looks.\n\n01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:24.000\nAnd for some reason, a characteristic of not aging,\n\n01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.000\nI was always a precognitive child.\n\n01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:33.000\nI was born a precog, that is to say that I can sense future events.\n\n01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000\nOh, you're like Jeff.\n\n01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:47.000\nThere is a gelatin that floats in the sky that you cannot see or touch,\n\n01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:53.000\nbut I can perceive it and perceive from it and draw from it such things as horrible accidents\n\n01:55:53.000 --> 01:56:00.000\nand crimes and misdemeanors, et cetera.\n\n01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:07.000\nMy mother sensing this would put me to some sort of persecution, built a precog bath in the basement.\n\n01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:12.000\nMy father, being scared of this, ran away.\n\n01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.000\nShe educated me in the ways of precognition, though she herself was not the precog,\n\n01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.000\nbut she was a good reader and a great teacher.\n\n01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.000\nAt a certain time, I was urged to leave and try to find employment.\n\n01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.000\nChildren would laugh at me in school, and I did not do very well because of this,\n\n01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000\nand so I took small jobs.\n\n01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.000\nI was very old, and I got a job as a busboy.\n\n01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:43.000\nI worked with the underground restaurants and bars.\n\n01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000\nThey did not know if I was a boy or a man.\n\n01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000\nI was at this age a man, but they would say, hey.\n\n01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000\nHow old were you?\n\n01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.000\nAt this point, I was some 26 years old.\n\n01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000\nSo, of course, this is 2074.\n\n01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000\nIs that correct?\n\n01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000\nClose enough.\n\n01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:11.000\nI worked making the most money onto the table in cash with mafia and jacuzzi families,\n\n01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:16.000\nboth in the nighttime working in the little Italy section\n\n01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:23.000\nand in the evening working in a little Osaka.\n\n01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000\nThey had no problem spilling their information to me,\n\n01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.000\nso I learned a lot about the underground and how it works.\n\n01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.000\nYou'd be very surprised to know that the underground is really the overground.\n\n01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:38.000\nEverything that works in front of you is moved by people you do not see.\n\n01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:43.000\nIt is not called shadow run for no reason.\n\n01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:51.000\nYou must think into opposites, and you must be neither.\n\n01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:59.000\nBecause I still have precognition, I like to go outside at night\n\n01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:05.000\nwhen the machines are humming and whirring and the night air is moist.\n\n01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000\nIt is there that these thoughts come to me,\n\n01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:13.000\nand once such night to go out and the boss of my place in little Italy is crying.\n\n01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000\nHe's smoking a cigarette and crying.\n\n01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.000\nI say, what is your problem?\n\n01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000\nHe says, you can go home.\n\n01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000\nThere will be no restaurant tomorrow.\n\n01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.000\nI cannot explain.\n\n01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:30.000\nI go back to my studio apartment, which is not so much an apartment\n\n01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000\nbecause there is no floor.\n\n01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:39.000\nThere's only a tub of water in which I built a precognition tub for myself.\n\n01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:45.000\nFrom this, I put on opera, sauvage, a composition by Vangelis.\n\n01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000\nTasty choice.\n\n01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:56.000\nA precognition suit such as Samantha Morton might wear to an event or a gala.\n\n01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000\nYou love that minority report.\n\n01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:07.000\nI lay myself above and using the power of rear thought suspend myself without a net over the water.\n\n01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:12.000\nAnd I saw an incident at which a man with a loaded pistol would come to him\n\n01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.000\nand shoot my boss's brains out.\n\n01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:20.000\nI waited for the vision of a woman with a wristwatch to walk by\n\n01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:26.000\nand focused on the wristwatch, got the time of day knowing that it was night\n\n01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:33.000\nand there is no 2.36 that PM that is at night.\n\n01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.000\nI sensed it was 2.36 a.m.\n\n01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.000\nI went to the cross streets and waited.\n\n01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000\nWhat time was this at?\n\n01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000\n2.36 a.m.\n\n01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000\nWhat time did you get the vision?\n\n01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:51.000\nI got the vision at 2.34, but this was the day before.\n\n01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000\nOh, okay, so you had plenty of time to get there.\n\n01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000\nI had plenty of time to get there, but no, I had to get a weapon.\n\n01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.000\nI had to stuff the man with the weapon.\n\n02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:04.000\nI got the weapon from a Yucuza boss in Osaka.\n\n02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:09.000\nI then waited on the corner when I recognized the man and I saw the woman with the watch.\n\n02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000\nI raised the gun, I shot him in the head.\n\n02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:18.000\nI then had to go on the run deep into the annals or annals of Little Italy\n\n02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:21.000\nwhere I met a man who would become my father figure.\n\n02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:27.000\nHis name was Gepetto 5.0\n\n02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:35.000\nwho outfitted me with silicon and cyber devices, arms.\n\n02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000\nWe just heard the cold open.\n\n02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.000\nHe's just now becoming...\n\n02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:48.000\nThis is the opening narration.\n\n02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:53.000\nAt what point do you flee to Brazil as a Nazi doctor?\n\n02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000\nBecause you sound like a Nazi doctor.\n\n02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:00.000\nAt what point do you launch an award-winning career as a documentary director?\n\n02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000\nAnyway, sorry.\n\n02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.000\nIf I were, I would do something like this and something different.\n\n02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.000\nBut anyway, I have a cyber device to touch on.\n\n02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000\nExcuse me, go ahead.\n\n02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.000\nWould you better 5.0 continue?\n\n02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000\nYes.\n\n02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:15.000\nHe just gives me a number of attachments and things and ways to better myself,\n\n02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:20.000\nincluding skill softs which are programs that allow me to master certain tasks\n\n02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000\nand things through a cranial implant.\n\n02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.000\nAnd with this, I can function for myself.\n\n02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.000\nBut I cannot go back into that world, although I have all of this knowledge of how they operate.\n\n02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:37.000\nAnd so I run around in the shadows between streets and avenues and boulevards and byways,\n\n02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.000\nbartering with what I know to do best.\n\n02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:47.000\nAnd that is to sneak up and stop problems, sense problems, eliminate situations.\n\n02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:53.000\nSometimes with weapons, otherwise with cunning and guile.\n\n02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:58.000\nI can occasionally step out into the light because everyone still thinks I'm a boy.\n\n02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.000\nOh.\n\n02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.000\nOh.\n\n02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:01.000\nWow.\n\n02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:02.000\nUh-oh.\n\n02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:03.000\nWow.\n\n02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:07.000\nEveryone still thinks I'm a boy.\n\n02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:08.000\nWow.\n\n02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:14.000\nI guess if David wants to tell us about his character, we'll just...\n\n02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:19.000\nMy name is Chrissy Tilmick.\n\n02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:26.000\nI am a 12-year-old LGBT transgender.\n\n02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:35.000\nI was born with six toes on each foot, but I now currently have three on each foot.\n\n02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:42.000\nAnd my father killed chickens with his mind.\n\n02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:46.000\nWe would travel from small town to small town.\n\n02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000\nSome people were enamored of that.\n\n02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000\nSome people thought he had great powers.\n\n02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000\nSome people were scared of him and frightened.\n\n02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000\nAs a result, we were constantly moving.\n\n02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.000\nWe had a 1969 Dodge Dart.\n\n02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:06.000\nAnd one day, my mother and father were very much in love.\n\n02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.000\nHe had sworn on their wedding day.\n\n02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:14.000\nThey loped, but it was still a wedding and it was a day, so it was a wedding day.\n\n02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:19.000\nThat he would never use his ability to kill chickens with his mind in any negative way\n\n02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:20.000\ntowards her.\n\n02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:29.000\nOne day, we were chased out of a town, Birmingham, Alabama, and he was drinking heavily\n\n02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:35.000\nand he started what looked like the process of trying to kill my mom.\n\n02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000\nIt was gone.\n\n02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000\nThat upset me terribly.\n\n02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000\nI went running out.\n\n02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:49.000\nMy mom chased me and she was killed by a heronado, which is a...\n\n02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:54.000\nAs everyone knows, after the year 2021,\n\n02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:02.000\ngovernment Obama was still in office and invented heronados,\n\n02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.000\nwhich is a combination of a hurricane and a tornado.\n\n02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:11.000\nThat was shortly before they revealed chemtrails are a real thing.\n\n02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.000\nThey're not just silicon.\n\n02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000\nSo my mom was killed.\n\n02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000\nIt was a terrifying thing for me to witness.\n\n02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000\nAs I looked behind my...\n\n02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.000\nI had three shoulders and I looked behind the middle one.\n\n02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:30.000\nI could see my dad running after and the entire town of Birmingham, Alabama,\n\n02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000\nhe got swallowed into the...\n\n02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.000\nAs they grabbed him and they pulled him and he was like,\n\n02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000\nChrissy, Chrissy!\n\n02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.000\nAnd I could see it was scratching at the ground and blood came from his nails\n\n02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000\nand went down to stubs as he was trying to claw his way to me.\n\n02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:52.000\nI just knew it was fight or flight and I decided I'm going to flight.\n\n02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:59.000\nAnd I went to Birmingham International Airport\n\n02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.000\nand I used all my remaining...\n\n02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:07.000\nI had some fun bucks left over from a Chuck E. Cheese and I turned them in.\n\n02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:17.000\nI got on a plane to 2032, which was the only time I could afford.\n\n02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000\nAnd there I...\n\n02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:25.000\nWhen I got off the plane, I just did that classic Chrissy Tillman thing where I looked down\n\n02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:30.000\nand the first sign I saw was for Davos and I went,\n\n02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:38.000\nI'm your guy and I got in the car and ended up at a Davos conference.\n\n02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:45.000\nJenna Bush was speaking and I managed to sneak into her hotel room\n\n02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.000\nin a way that I'd only seen in hollow movies,\n\n02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000\nwhich is a way that people watch movies in the future.\n\n02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:57.000\nHe got that right, he got that right.\n\n02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.000\nBy being underneath the catering tray table\n\n02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:07.000\nand then I snuck out and I assumed Jenna Bush's personality\n\n02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:12.000\nand her identification tron.\n\n02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:19.000\nWhich was, she didn't even put away, it was in the closet, the closet was open.\n\n02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000\nI just took Jenna Bush's...\n\n02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000\nShe just left her identification tron.\n\n02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000\nHe just added tron.\n\n02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000\nYeah, this shit is easy.\n\n02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:41.000\nAnd I remembered, as I was climbing the antenna spire,\n\n02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:46.000\nI remembered, wait, my mother, her last dying thing,\n\n02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:52.000\nas the heronata was sucking her into the vortex,\n\n02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:56.000\nand she threw the pills at me and said,\n\n02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:00.000\nshould anything happen, take these pills.\n\n02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.000\nAnd I did, and then I went back in time to where we were a happy family,\n\n02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.000\nbut I was always able to access everything post that.\n\n02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:11.000\nSo not only am I currently with my happy family\n\n02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.000\nknowing what the future will bring,\n\n02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.000\nbut I also concurrently run in the shadows,\n\n02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:21.000\nbecause I fucking love that song.\n\n02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:25.000\nWow, what a character.\n\n02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000\nI think that's the end of our show.\n\n02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000\nWait, I have my guy.\n\n02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000\nWhat's that?\n\n02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.000\nI have a guy too.\n\n02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:34.000\nOh god, oh god, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n\n02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:39.000\nDon't forget me saying, I think that's the end of our show.\n\n02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:43.000\nI'm just gonna read this, and that'll be the end of the show.\n\n02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.000\nMy guy talks like me.\n\n02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:49.000\nI'm just gonna read what you said, is that okay?\n\n02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:53.000\nUnless you have any great ideas that have come up to the surface\n\n02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000\nfrom these wonderful narrations.\n\n02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:00.000\nIs there a him, Nato?\n\n02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:05.000\nWhen we looked at it, what we thought was...\n\n02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:10.000\nIt sounded like a herstory moment, but...\n\n02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.000\nI'll have to check with the ladies at Vassar and Sarah Lawrence,\n\n02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:17.000\nthe feminist studies group, see what they think.\n\n02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000\nSpencer, what is a shadow runner?\n\n02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:22.000\nA shadow runner is basically like a member of the A team.\n\n02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:25.000\nWhen people need their help and they can afford it,\n\n02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000\nthey get the A team, you know?\n\n02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000\nAnd they do illegal stuff, they do cool things.\n\n02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000\nBut they're usually good guys?\n\n02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000\nNo, I mean, they're criminals, they could be murderers, assassins.\n\n02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:38.000\nThey ride in a van and they have lunchboxes with their faces on it.\n\n02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:42.000\nTypical mercenary.\n\n02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.000\nI'm just gonna read the paragraph.\n\n02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000\nDr. Friend, that's my guy's name.\n\n02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000\nUnless you have a better name.\n\n02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:53.000\nI don't think you can talk Dr. Friend.\n\n02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:57.000\nDentist, Frank.\n\n02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:03.000\nDentist friend is the troll doctor, dentist.\n\n02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:08.000\nA criminal slash doctor whose practice is everywhere the core aren't.\n\n02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.000\nCorpse, like corpse corporations.\n\n02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000\nSorry, everybody.\n\n02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.000\nDr. Friend is a troll doctor.\n\n02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.000\nI have to start over every time someone says something.\n\n02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:25.000\nDo try periodonist.\n\n02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:30.000\nPeriodonist friend is a troll periodonist.\n\n02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:37.000\nA criminal slash periodonist whose practice is everywhere the core aren't.\n\n02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:43.000\nPeriodonist friend has a magical mastery over medicine and the metahuman body.\n\n02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.000\nWith a less than firm commitment to the Hippocratic Oath.\n\n02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:51.000\nNice.\n\n02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000\nThat was a little glib.\n\n02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:56.000\nWith a less than firm commitment.\n\n02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:00.000\nAlright, CW, I see what you mean.\n\n02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:06.000\nPeriodonist friend is bound to never harm anyone who hasn't harmed him first.\n\n02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:09.000\nOriginally a corporate periodonist.\n\n02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000\nFor fun, can you say endodontist?\n\n02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000\nEndodontist? What is that?\n\n02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.000\nIt's root canals.\n\n02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000\nJust root canals?\n\n02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000\nYeah, basically it's nerves.\n\n02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000\nPeriodontist is guns and endodontist is root canals.\n\n02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000\nSounds so drunk right now.\n\n02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.000\nIt's basically nerves.\n\n02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.000\nIt's nerves, roots, root canals, nerves.\n\n02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000\nEndodontist?\n\n02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000\nEndodontist.\n\n02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:44.000\nOkay, I mean, it's not important.\n\n02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:48.000\nOh no, I didn't mean to qualify that as being important.\n\n02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.000\nIt's not important, say whatever you want, say periodontist.\n\n02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:56.000\nI thought we were giving a request like you were a DJ at a birthday party.\n\n02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000\nSo I said endodontist.\n\n02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000\nOriginally a corporate endodontist.\n\n02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:04.000\nOne friend, one friend, that's me.\n\n02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.000\nThat's me.\n\n02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.000\nOne friend goblinized into a troll.\n\n02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.000\nGoblin is not a verb.\n\n02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:17.000\nGoblinization is a thing that happens in the history of the Shadowrun milieu.\n\n02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000\nVampiric virus.\n\n02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000\nI turn from human into a troll.\n\n02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.000\nYeah, trolls just get turned into them from humans.\n\n02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:28.000\nHe was cast out of the corporation with extreme prejudice,\n\n02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:31.000\nforced to ply his trade in the streets.\n\n02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:36.000\nDespite this fall from grace, he only accepts payment from the moderately wealthy\n\n02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000\nfor his superior service.\n\n02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.000\nTreating the poor and needy free of charge.\n\n02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.000\nSounds like a good guy.\n\n02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000\nSounds like a friend.\n\n02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000\nSounds like a friend, that's right.\n\n02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000\nThat's all I need to say, right?\n\n02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.000\nI prefer not to fight, but when I must, I tend to favor not only the weapons\n\n02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:59.000\nsuch as a stun baton or gel and shock rounds from my silent submachine gun.\n\n02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.000\nThat sounds like a very violent weapon.\n\n02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.000\nI use no weaponry other than this submachine gun.\n\n02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:11.000\nI think at a moment when someone would go,\n\n02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:16.000\nthat's really nice that you take care of poor people for free.\n\n02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:20.000\nYou say it in an alleyway just to that other person, you go,\n\n02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:23.000\nthe poor become the rich.\n\n02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.000\nAnd the rich are always dying.\n\n02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.000\nAnd they'll always be more poor.\n\n02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000\nDid you just come up with that quote?\n\n02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000\nThat's really good.\n\n02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.000\nAre you being sarcastic?\n\n02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000\nNo.\n\n02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.000\nReally?\n\n02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:38.000\nIt's really good.\n\n02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.000\nIt's like the blind guy in Minority Report.\n\n02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:42.000\nI like it.\n\n02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000\nI think I might be a little drunk.\n\n02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.000\nI should be riffing dialogue for you.\n\n02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.000\nThat was really good.\n\n02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:49.000\nThank you.\n\n02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:52.000\nDoesn't the logic collapse under the poor become the rich?\n\n02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:56.000\nDoesn't that stop right there?\n\n02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000\nThis is a fantasy world, David.\n\n02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:01.000\nIt's a weird world where if you're poor, you're safe.\n\n02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000\nBut you have teeth problems.\n\n02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:07.000\nAnd then only your ambition to become rich eventually kills you.\n\n02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.000\nI like that this is the least believable bit of this for you.\n\n02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000\nThe poor become the rich.\n\n02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.000\nNo, I've heard everything.\n\n02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.000\nShadowrun's a fun game, but in terms of wealth distribution,\n\n02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.000\na lot like our world.\n\n02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000\nI'm not sure I believe it.\n\n02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.000\nAll right.\n\n02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000\nWell, we've conquered all these worlds.\n\n02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000\nNow how do we end things?\n\n02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:30.000\nProbably with a rap, right?\n\n02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.000\nI'll do a rap.\n\n02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000\nDo a rap.\n\n02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:42.000\nRap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap,\n\n02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.000\nclappity clap time to rap.\n\n02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:49.000\nEvery rap has some kind of rap jazz.\n\n02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:53.000\nWhen you rap your ass, the person you came in as,\n\n02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000\nand I accept you.\n\n02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:58.000\nTo get to do, to get to do, to get to do.\n\n02:13:58.000 --> 02:13:59.000\nI accept you.\n\n02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:02.000\nIt's funny that David thinks that this is your rap every time.\n\n02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000\nThe great thing would be to do a rap\n\n02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.000\nand have David Cross, who has a beautiful angelic voice,\n\n02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:13.000\ndo the rap bridge, the R&B, like, do, do, do.\n\n02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000\nDo we have a rap beat?\n\n02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000\nI think so, yeah, yeah.\n\n02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.000\nAll right.\n\n02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000\nSo I'll do a little bit and then I'll cue you\n\n02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.000\nand then you do like the, you do like the, you know, the bridge.\n\n02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000\nThe singing part.\n\n02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:40.000\nWe hope you come back to the show.\n\n02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:46.000\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:50.000\nCity sirens, police in the distance, cityscape.\n\n02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:53.000\nI'm gonna go the distance up.\n\n02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.000\nI'm Dr. Urban Anthropy.\n\n02:14:56.000 -->
