Welcome to Miltown Comics in beautiful Hollywood, California!

00:22.000 --> 00:50.000
Welcome to Miltown Comics in beautiful Hollywood, California!

00:50.000 --> 01:02.000
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:02.000 --> 01:15.000
Fucking shit! Shit! Fucking shit, man! Oh, shit!

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
Oh, my ass!

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
No, no. I'm very excited to be here tonight, Dan, Daniel.

01:29.000 --> 01:39.000
I don't know if I've mentioned this to you in the past 25 years, but your sincerity sounds sarcastic.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
That's my Midwest accent.

01:42.000 --> 01:56.000
Let's bring Game Master Spencer Crittenden out. Game Master!

01:56.000 --> 02:06.000
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Shit! Shit!

02:06.000 --> 02:15.000
Fucking shit!

02:15.000 --> 02:24.000
All right. It was great. Thank you. It was good. It was pretty good.

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
It was great. It was freezing. I was walking home from the bar tonight, and it was freezing.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
It was freezing outside. It was cold out. You were wearing a shirt.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
So nice. I went into the Froyo. You went into the Froyo?

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
It's warmer in the Froyo. That's how cold it is.

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
Well, I got to get out of this Arctic chill. I better go to the frozen yogurt area.

02:50.000 --> 02:57.000
No, because the Froyo was not packed. It was deserted. That's how cold it was.

02:57.000 --> 03:06.000
It was deserted. Look at this guy. Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
We're like the lions in front of the Chicago Museum of Natural History.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Oh, shit! That's what they're saying, right?

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
You want a book? Shit! Oh, shit!

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
So Halloween's upon us. You must be excited. You're one of those people.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
I'm one of those people that is excited. What does that mean?

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Well, you like to put effort into the Halloween. I like putting effort into the Halloween.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
You make the costumes there. I make the costumes.

03:36.000 --> 03:49.000
You're like one of those Adam Savage art school, I don't know, dyslexic people.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
This is true. It's a big day of the year for you.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
You like to go like, oh, look at me. I'm a big robot.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Dan, what are you going to go for Halloween? Are you going to dress up this year?

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
I am proud to say that it's a decision I have never made until three hours before any party I go to on Halloween.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
And I have always done it with items in and around my neighborhood.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
What is your favorite Halloween costume that you've ever done since knowing me?

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
Well, I'm not counting the ones that you made for me. You made me a ghostbuster.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Yes, I did.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
I was a ghostbuster. That was my best Halloween costume that I ever had.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I didn't make that costume.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
That's true. I made it.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
You made me a proton pack out of household objects. It looked like a proton pack.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
It looked like one.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
It was great.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
It was good.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Great.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
So here's the thing. So you know these people...

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
That was the best one.

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
Yeah, it was. My favorite one is when I found that computer monitor on the street, the day of Halloween.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
I took it home. I took all the stuff out. I put the monitor on my head.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I glued Viking horns to it from a helmet.

04:56.000 --> 05:05.000
I put on a fur diaper and a tail, and I was a monitor.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
And it was comfortable. I could sit.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
And all the fratty guys at the park, because I was going out.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
That was the only time in my life that fratty guys liked me.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
I won a costume contest, because I kind of had like a Belushi-ish kind of hairy appeal.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Let me just explain.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
You only had the furry diaper and monitor. You were shirtless.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Yeah.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Yeah.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
I had a little fur cape because of my shoulder acne.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I remember that. Yes.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Okay.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
So...

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
That was a good one.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
So Halloween... So Dino and I were just talking about this.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
So you know those people... So when they meet you...

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Some of you are listening that are these people.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
I've never been so certain about something.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I'm not a guy who proclaims things.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
You know me. This show is about me being old and going like, I don't know what to make of this.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
What do you kids think?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
You're like, you're racist.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
And I go, you're right.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Dad's racist.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
You know what? What is race?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
And they're like, you're right. Stop talking about it so much.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
I'm like, I talk about it too much. You kids are right.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
But here's something I'm absolutely certain of that I don't care.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I don't care if I'm the one person on Earth saying this.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
If you're one of those people who when you meet somebody, if you ever hear yourself saying the words,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
you don't remember my name, do you?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Yeah.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
I'm not going to say you're a terrible piece of shit.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Because you might be doing it because you learned...

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
You know how dogs learn to lift their leg from other dogs?

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Some dogs spend their whole life going like that.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Like Harvey. And then Nigel's just like, fuck it.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
And then after a while, I guess they actually learned...

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
That's not important.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
But you might have learned that behavior.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
You might have learned that by being rewarded for it.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
That's why I'm telling you.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
If you're doing that, you are doing a bad thing to another person.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Why is it bad?

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
I know why it's bad, but I want education to happen.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Okay, so let's break it down.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Okay, do you want to VR this? Should we VR it?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Wait, VR it?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
What, very...

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Virtual reality.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Veronica Robbins.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
I don't... Why would VR? We are VR.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
It's a show.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Okay, great.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Okay, we're at a party.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Oh, okay.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
That's role-playing.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Tomato, tomato, all right.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Okay, here we go.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Okay, all right. I'm at a party.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Hello.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Hello.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Oh, hey, hey.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Hey.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Hey.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Hi, Dan.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
How's it going?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
It's going pretty good.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
You don't remember me, do you?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
This party's amazing.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Kevin, who invited me to the party, and whose name I know,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
did a great job hanging all these streamers,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I work with him.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
He's my special effects engineer.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
I had conversations with him about his children.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
Kevin, his party, Dan, no.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Freeze it.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
What happened?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Let's...

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Hitchhiker's guide.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
What happened?

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
What happened there?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
I know what happened.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
You know what happened.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
They need to know what happened.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
What happened is that my...

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Well, okay, so here's the thing, but I've been...

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
It's a bait and switch.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
What?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
What?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
It's a...

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Because it always starts with this face.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Yeah.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Why is that a bait and switch?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
It seems like a bait and bait.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Well, I don't know.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Maybe I'm using bait and switch, Ron.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
But it's...

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Entrapment is what it is.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
But is it even that?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
It's just somebody coming up, I mean,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
it's like if a cop just came up and said,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
you're doing drugs, you're doing drugs, you're doing drugs,

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
you're doing drugs, it's not entrapment.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I think it's somebody who comes up to,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
knows that you're not going to remember their name

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
and goes, hello, Dan.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Makes it a point to say your name.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Right?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Well, let's get...

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I'm going to go one orbit beyond that.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Because what I want to say is like,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
let's really break this down.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
So let's say someone doesn't remember your name.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
So how is that on them?

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
If you're a human being and you acknowledge that

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
memory of your name is somehow currency,

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
then aren't you the poor one?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah, it's your fault.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
You didn't make an impression.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Right.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
And it's not...

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
That would be the way...

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
That's the way to flip it,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
because those people push your shame button

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
and you go, oh, I should remember your name.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
So then you want to flip it 180 degrees ago.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
No, you're a piece of shit and you're unmemorable.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
But like, somewhere in the middle there is just fucking reality.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Yeah.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Like, who cares?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Maybe I have a fucking illness.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Maybe I...

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Maybe you...

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Maybe you meet more people than the person who's complaining.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Maybe you look like my uncle.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
Maybe my eye has a fucking like baby's finger in it.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Like maybe I'm in a Japanese horror movie

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
where I got baby fingers in my eye.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Baby fingers in the eye.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Maybe an asteroid passed through the fucking Earth's orbit

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
and like made a gas that only I'm allergic to

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
and that only I can sense.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
It made me forget.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
It doesn't matter.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Why does that matter?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
It doesn't matter.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
When people drop their wallet on the floor,

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
which is as much like an accident as them not knowing your name,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
nobody ever goes like...

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Um...

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Uh...

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Uh...

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Uh...

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Uh...

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Uh...

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Uh...

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Uh...

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Uh...

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Uh...

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Uh...

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Uh...

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Uh...

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Uh...

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Uh...

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Uh...

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Uh...

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Save that jungle, man.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Save the jungle.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
From the great white hunter of you having dropped your wallet.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Aren't you thankful you met me?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
You're all stoked when someone drops their wallet.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yes.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
When they forget your name, you're like...

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Ow!

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Someone pooped their pants.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
But you know that you don't really think that.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
You know what you're thinking is,

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
uh-oh, I pooped the pants of memorability.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
And it's like...

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
And here's the thing.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
So this is why I've turned around on tattoos

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
and piercings and all that stuff.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Because I'm not saying like,

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
oh thank you and you're doing that for me,

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
so I remember who you are.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Your steel face or like, you know,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
spider neck or whatever.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
But these are people who...

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Okay, so I used to think, I was like,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
oh man, I don't trust you if you have tattoos.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
This is me 20 years ago.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Everybody in the audience has fucking tattoos now.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
And I love you all.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
But I used to be like,

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
when they first started becoming like a thing,

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
and I was always like,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
man, somebody's got like a tattoo

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
or like a thing through their face.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
And all I see is like somebody that's like,

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
thinking like, oh, I don't know who I am.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
They don't know who you are.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
And I'm like, I'm gonna move to California.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
That's who I am.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I'm gonna make everybody know who I am.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Everybody will know who I am

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
when I move to California.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
But now, in this apoc...

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
You're being sarcastic the whole night.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
No, I'm not.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
No, no.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
This is like...

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Ed McMahon did this to Johnny.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
No, no, no, no, no.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
You never knew.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
He could never nail him down.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
He was just always over there going,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
oh yeah.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
What a great job.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Everybody.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
I'm supporting.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And Johnny would go home and he'd go,

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I know that fucking asshole is fucking...

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
I'm gonna catch him.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
I'm gonna catch him.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I'm on your side.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
I'm on your side.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
So at least if you...

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
We all wake up with that feeling.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Oh boy, I hope people remember me.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Oh, I just met...

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I just ran into the sixth person this week

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
who it became clear like they had me confused

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
with someone else.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Like, I now told...

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Like the person who takes that onto themself,

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
I'm not saying it makes them a better or worse person,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
but like, at least they're...

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Well, I am saying it makes them a better person

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
because they're pretending their own garden.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Like I'm not saying they should do what they do

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
and people are gonna be offended because they're gonna go,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
I have a tattoo and guess what?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
It's an expression of this.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
You're saying that it's because I'm an incomplete person.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
I'm not saying that.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
I'm just saying like,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
now when I see somebody who has something weird about them,

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
like a funny hat but at an angle

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
or like a bird on their shoulder.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Like one boot's big and the other one's like really small.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
The small boot.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Or your name.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Your name is like Trisha,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
but it's spelled with nine i's.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Yeah.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
And one of them's an e, but it's called an i.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
Now I'm like, oh, this is a person who is kind of saying like...

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I'm meaning you halfway.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
They're saying like, I'm making this my problem, not yours.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
I don't know if it's true.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
I don't know if it's not true,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
but I'm doing something about it by myself.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
I'm going down to the corner.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
I'm going to say stick a needle in my face

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
and draw a scorpion on it

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
and like fucking like take some shit,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
put it up my butt and give me a tail.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
You're asking people to do that too?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
No.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
You just said I'm...

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Okay, I lost you with the needle in the butt.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
But I also started paying attention.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
But the people who go like, you don't know my name, do you?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
So just don't do that because you might have...

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Don't do it.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
It's like a social thing where you're like,

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
oh, I have leverage now.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
You don't have leverage.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
They're going to...

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
Everyone that you hope that would affect in your favor,

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
like that's exactly the person that's going to bum out the most.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Like the thing that it's like...

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Always just always...

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
I always do this.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Like I just go like...

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Just be the person that says,

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
if there's even 10% of a reason to be unsure,

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
just say, oh, Matt Dawson,

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
just in case you don't remember or something like that.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
That's what I do.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
I always say, you know,

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
hey, I don't know if you remember,

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
or even I don't know if you remember is kind of like sets them up.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
But we'll figure it out.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
But I do it from a point of,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I don't expect you to remember,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
maybe because you probably have a busy day.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
You have children.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
You have a car.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
You have shows that you watch with other names of characters

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
and stuff like that.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
That's a lot to process.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
So I'm saying, hey, hey, how you doing?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Oh, you remembered me.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Oh, bonus for me that you remembered me.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Oh.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
So make that noise more often.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
So here's the funny thing.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
This Halloween, now watch for this.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
So this is why I brought this all up.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Because Dino and I were talking about this.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
We're talking about that topic.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
And then we started talking about Halloween costumes.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
And we started talking about the people who do like the puns.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
Like the one that I really remember very clearly

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
was somebody in Milwaukee that was like,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
he was like pitching somebody their Halloween costume

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
in front of me.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
And I was just like sitting there at the bar.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
And he's like, this is what I'm going to do.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Paint myself blue, head to toe,

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
and look with a frame, like an empty frame.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I'm going to carry it around.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
And I'm making you guess.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Gay or New England?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
I just noticed.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Because I'm trying to do an actual impression of this guy.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
And I'm like, wait, is he gay or is he from New England?

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
I was like, I'm going to have a painting frame.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
And then tampons on strings just all around.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
And then he waits.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
He waits for the five second pause, which is what people do.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
And they just, when they pitch you,

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
their fucking pun Halloween costumes.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
And then he goes, Picasso's blue period.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
And the, yeah.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Because what, and where in the world,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
what dimension is anyone going to go like,

16:53.000 --> 17:03.000
oh, God, I knew the words blue and period would be involved.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
Because you painted yourself blue.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
And then tampons are for periods.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Did that person ever follow through and make that costume?

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
I bet he didn't because he talked it out.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
You don't see Woody Allen being like,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
what if I did a drama?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
He's like, tippy-tap, tap, tap.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
He doesn't give a shit if the movie's good or bad.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
He's like, now he's getting 90 movies.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
So of course he has five great ones.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Obviously I have access to grind hair.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Ooh, here we go.

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
Shots fired.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
So, okay.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
So just give me a second.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Just let me say so for a second.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Just give me a second.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Just give me a second.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
So this Halloween, so here's the thing.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
So you're going to be walking around

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
and there's going to be, of course,

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
there's the usual amount of now aging kitty cats.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
I think that's like a baby boomer thing right now.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Kitty cats.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Yeah, kitty cats, a sexy kitty cat.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Oh, okay.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Right.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
And then there's that whole thing.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
And then there's a lot of puns, a lot of pun people.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
So pay attention to this, these pun people,

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
these pun costume people.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
Because Dino was telling the story about how a guy came up

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
and he was wearing blue from the neck down

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
and then he had like a white cotton thing on top.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
And this is the thing that happens at Halloween parties.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
And he goes like, what do you think?

18:37.000 --> 18:43.000
And Dino's like, oh, very scary.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
And the guy goes, I'm a Q-tip.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
And Dino's like, why aren't your shoes furry?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
And why am I having this conversation

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
and why is this not Riddle Day?

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
And if it was, you're cheating like Bilbo Bag and saying,

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
what's in my pocket?

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
Like you're not doing a good, your fantasy is to be a Q-tip

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
and to have people go, ah, it's Q-tip.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
Or is it, and underneath that Q-tip costume,

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
isn't there a guy who on Monday morning

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
at the water cooler is going to be saying,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
you don't know my name, do you?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
No.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
It's the same fucking guy.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
You just watch them.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
And they're reptile people.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
They go to Halloween and they go like,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
they purposely make the shitty pun costume

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
and then they walk around and go,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
because they can't take one day off

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
of being, of everyone else's fault,

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
of it being everyone else's fault that they're not memorable.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Halloween should be their fucking leg.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
That should be their Achilles heel, baby,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
because they get to be whoever they want.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
And then it's their fault if you don't know them.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Because if they were, if they're Fred Flintstone

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
and you don't know, it's their fault.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
They're hoping.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
And I'm telling you, it's just as much their fault

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
that you don't know they're Bob Johnson.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
364 days a year.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
So they fucking check it out.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
And they go like, they make the Fred Flintstone shirt

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
like kind of purple.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
And they put the tire on their shoulder

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
so that they're like, I'm Fred Flintstone

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
after the OJ trials or something.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
And it's like, you always think like,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
oh, the joke didn't land.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
No, reptile person.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
Like, can't fuck a cold-blooded animal.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Can't fucking do it.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
If you have to go, guess what I am,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
you did it wrong.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Hey, yeah, you know, if you got to go,

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
ask me what I'm, what I am,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
you did it wrong.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Oh, not just kind of wrong.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
I mean, if you're...

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
If your idea of a seven-course meal

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
is a six-pack and a hot dog,

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
you might have a Halloween costume.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
Here comes the phone.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
Hello, driver's license?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Yeah, and I don't know if you people

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
are familiar with this problem,

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
but I haven't done my left hand on my phone yet.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Oh, man.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
So I have to, it's just, it's a nightmare.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
You got to bite that bullet.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
I haven't scanned my left thumb yet.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
You got to scan it, man.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
I know.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
It takes like two minutes.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
The worst.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
My hands are too sweaty for those things.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
They don't read it.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
I swear, if these people knew how we really lived,

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
it must be nice for them.

21:38.000 --> 21:44.000
My thumbs are greasy from all those chips that I eat.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I eat a lot of chips.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
All right, I don't have anything else to say.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Chips are delicious.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
I have some chips before I came here.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
All right, hey, so I think we'll do things in...

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
Hashtag Chips.

21:59.000 --> 22:06.000
Why would you hashtag chips?

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Oh, you have a gift for you?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Oh, you have a gift?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Yeah.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Okay.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Did you, is this a plant?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
What happened?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
What's going on?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Does this happen every show?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
I should know about this stuff.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
I'm controlling.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
No, this is a world tour.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
This is hot sauce.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
People will fuck you up, man.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Oh, no.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
You should stick it up your butt.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
You should definitely stick it up your butt.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
If you don't, you're using it wrong.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
No, I also gave you some toothpicks.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
So the whole point of the hot sauce...

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
It's got to be thick, then.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
I can also come up and show you if you buy it.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
All right, well, yeah, I mean, it would be weird

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
to not bring you up now.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
This is the hottest hot sauce in the world.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
What voice is coming out of the darkness?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Sit in this chair if you can.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Oh, damn, excuse me here.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
There's a lot of hot sauce in the world with some toothpicks.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
This is encouraging behavior that is going to snowball

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
for the rest of the show.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Yeah, if we're not careful, this show could lose it.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I've got the most poisonous poison in the world.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Here we go.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
No, honestly, like...

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
What's next, beef jerky?

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
This honestly shows how easy it would be to poison people.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Yeah, look at it.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
It looks like blood.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
What's your name, young man?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
My name is Garrett Harvey.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
And are you 12 years old?

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Well, he didn't say...

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
You know, I wish.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
The important thing is he'll...

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
When I asked him his name, he didn't say

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
Garrett Jason Harvey or Garrett Lee Harvey.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
He's only got two names, so this should be safe.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Well...

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
That age joke was a diss on us, not you.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
You know that, right?

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
No, no, no, it's fine.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
So...

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
He's probably so young.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
He probably goes home and goes,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
someone called me 11 again.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
And he's back in Goldblum.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Mom!

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Does this look 11?

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
Does this look 11?

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
So, pretty much...

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
And the two picks are what for?

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
They're for eating the hot sauce,

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
which I wouldn't recommend.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Oh, really?

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Well, no, no, no.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
Who just eats fucking hot sauce on a toothpick?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
What?

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
What it is, is a...

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
You gotta put that shit on some chia...

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
You gotta get the chips out.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Where are the chips?

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Get some chips on here.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Get some chips.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
You put the hot sauce on a toothpick.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
No, no, no.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
What the fuck are you putting the hot sauce on a toothpick?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Who's got some chips?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Someone's got chips?

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
I think you should try it.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
His reaction would actually be pretty fucking awesome.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Well, I don't...

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
The thing that's confusing to me about this,

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
and I don't want to be like a negative,

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
a negative Nelly or Slur thing, but it just seems like...

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Well, of course...

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
You could bring battery acid up here,

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
and I was like...

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Oh, that's very hot.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
And then you're talking to me like,

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
oh, that hurts.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
I'm not like an adrenaline junkie or a...

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
I don't...

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
That's not gonna get me drunk or...

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
If you have enough of it, maybe.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
But it doesn't...

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
I mean, it's not...

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
It's not like jackass or anything.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
No, no, no.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
But it might make the show.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
It might make the show.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Well, I mean, insult taken, but...

25:17.000 --> 25:25.000
I hope to God, we don't get to that point, but...

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
If there's chips, if there's chips...

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
We got some chips!

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
We got some chips!

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Okay.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
We got chips!

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Okay, we got some chips.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Dan, we got chips.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
I'll have some.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Dan will have some.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Okay.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Well, why don't you...

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
We can't show the label.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I'll do it with all of you.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
You're gonna do it, too.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Why doesn't just he do it,

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
in case, you know, we have to do a show after this.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Right.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
Now, these are potato chips.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
They're not standard regulation chips.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Like, the possibility that this is great,

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
let's say it's one in four, but...

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Out of a thousand.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
The possibility of it going wrong,

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
the consequences of that are much, much more dire

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
than I think any possible...

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Right.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
I would say...

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Is it just physical pain?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Yeah, no, it just hurts, and there's no milk,

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
so you'll drink water or something,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
and then it'll hurt more, and it'll get worse.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Yeah.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Right.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Well, I'm as wide open, same as you,

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
but it's weird to just say no.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Hey, man.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I'm too trained for the theater.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
I'm not gonna do it.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
I already said yes!

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
We got the chips!

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I'm too shaped for the show, man!

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
Got the hashtag chips right there in the cup!

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Come on!

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Yeah, just...

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Make it alive.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
So, you want to do the chips and not the toothpick,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
because I'm offering you to just dip the tip of the toothpick

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
and just put it in your mouth.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Why would you...

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
See, if he's...

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
I'm offering you an easy way out.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
How do you eat it?

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
How do you eat it?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Dip the toothpick.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Okay, see...

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
For fun?

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
It doesn't make any sense.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
You're an insane person, then.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Like, why are you...

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
You're like a cone head.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
You're like Mark from Orc.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
What the hell?

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Are you...

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Put it on some chips!

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Okay!

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
But...

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Why do you put hot sauce on a toothpick?

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
But it's not food, Rob.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
It's not even a kind of...

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
He's going to hurt us really bad to the point where he doesn't even eat it on a chip.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
I'll do it.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
You'll eat it on a chip.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Let's see that.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Okay, but we got to do it all at the same time.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
This is the worst...

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
I hope you're proud of yourself, young man.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Like, I mean...

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
I'm doing this specifically because my sister listens to the podcast

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
and she told me not to embarrass her.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
What?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Yeah.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Ow!

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Ow!

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
Who makes the hottest hot sauce ever?

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
It's called Satan's Blood, so probably Satan.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Ask a stupid question.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
No, I don't...

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Let's just...

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
It's called Satan's Blood.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
What do you do?

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
You just hang out and you just dip toothpicks in Satan's Blood.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
I mean, don't pour it on.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Wipe the toothpick on it.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
I mean, you...

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
The joke is up.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
You might as well come up here with a stapler and go put this through your nuts

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
and we're like, why would I do that?

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
And then it's like, okay, here we go.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Here, you freaking amount.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
I mean...

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
I don't want that chip.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Give that chip to Spencer.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I'm not touching none of that.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
All right, so, I mean...

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Don't wait.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
I just don't know how it'll work on the chip.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
What, are you a foodie now?

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
I don't know!

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
You should really have white wine and fish with this.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Right, right, right.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
It's just acid.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
It's just a hurtful acid.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Look at him shake.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
This is some hot sauce.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Well, because he's like, gee, I hope I'm not...

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
What if I kill both of them?

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
I hope I didn't...

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
Yeah, we're gonna like shit our pants and die.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
Yes.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
I mean, it's just...

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
So, again, I mean, I wouldn't recommend this at all.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Like, it's not a joke.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Yeah, you're right.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
We shouldn't do it right now.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Why don't we just didn't do it right now?

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
Just think about the hottest hot sauce you've ever had.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
My tongue will swell.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
This is a lot hotter than any of that.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
My tongue will swell?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
It could...

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Any number of terrible things may happen.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
But all that could happen, and that's good, is maybe it'll be kind of entertaining for

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
five minutes or so.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I just don't think the math works out.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Okay, I totally agree with you.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Wait!

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Absolutely 100% agree with you, but there's no choice.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
It's like, can you go going up to the...

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
You're saying no?

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
I'd be a hero if I didn't do it.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
All right, go ahead. They're saying no.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
They're saying no.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
No, they would be disappointed in me for doing that.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
So, just walk me through this.

29:41.000 --> 29:50.000
Like, it's a Friday afternoon, and you're like, hey, man, let's skip class and stick...

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Two picks in the hot...

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
It's Satan's blood, and just like, have a good time, man.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
I honestly...

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
It's for a laugh factor, so you just give it to people who've never had it before.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Just be like, hey, this is what you expect from the group.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
All right.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
We're going to fuck with you.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
All right, let's all have a hand for...

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
It's like a hand buzzer in your mouth.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
I'm not gonna...

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
It's not even temporary.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Like, Spencer, he's saying your tongue could swell up.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
It could.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
They said don't do it.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Okay, I'm gonna hold onto it.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
If the show starts dying, I'm gonna eat it.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Okay.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Yeah, mine's right here.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Okay, if it comes down to that, then we'll do it.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Sounds good.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
The rest of this is for you.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Okay, thank you.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Terrific.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
Now, we fuck off, ladies.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
We'll do that.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
We got a lot of guests tonight.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
That's the thing.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
Some of them are aneurysm survivors, not to make you feel too guilty.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Kind of a letdown.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Do with that information what you will.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
Well, Schrab could do it.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
That's fine if Schrab doesn't.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
I'm gonna wait.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
You're saying it was a letdown and I didn't eat the chipper.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
There's a letdown that he...

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
I'm so happy.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
That his food turned out to be a practical joke.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
What are you saying?

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Yes.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
All right.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
We gotta move on.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
Can we move the fuck on with the fucking show?

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Schrab.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
Because I got a lot of shit to do tonight.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
A lot of shit.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
All right.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Hey, I'm gonna yell at me.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I've had it with you.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
I know.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Let's bring out both...

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Wait, wait.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Hold on.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
I'm gonna figure out what order to do this in.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Because we gotta check...

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Do it in the right order.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I'm trying to...

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Well, I'm trying to figure out what that is.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Mmm.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
That fucking hot sauce guy.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Now we have him to blame for the whole night.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
That's what's nice about it.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
I liked what happened.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
You liked what happened?

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Yeah, I know.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
It's not a popular opinion.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Well, it was sort of a defiance of the usual dynamic that I was struggling with.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
I was like, well, this is like Evil Knievel goes up to the Grand Canyon and then turns around.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
But like, how entertaining is it that he just goes over the Grand Canyon?

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
And then he's like, oh, I broke my leg.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
And it's like, what's wrong with our society?

31:50.000 --> 31:56.000
Evil Knievel was a stuntman from 2,000 years ago.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
For anybody who doesn't know what Dan is talking about.

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
In case you thought he was an accountant.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
I don't know.

32:06.000 --> 32:13.000
Hey, he didn't name himself Evil Knievel because he thought, oh, I only want to be famous in 1975.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
He's like, they're gonna remember this name.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
Even if they don't, they're gonna know what I do from it.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Right.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Evil Knievel.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
I'm gonna evil all the Knievels.

32:25.000 --> 32:34.000
All right, let's bring out both at the same time because they both belong to the same family.

32:34.000 --> 32:39.000
We talked to Felicia Day last week and these are two good friends of hers.

32:39.000 --> 32:47.000
They've both done stuff for geek and sundry if you're a geek sundering around there.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
But they're just two folks that I've always wanted to have a chat with.

32:51.000 --> 33:01.000
Let's bring out In Order of Gender.

33:01.000 --> 33:13.000
Don't fuck this up, Dan.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Don't fuck this up.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
Oh, Jesus, God.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
The chip's like breaking glass.

33:22.000 --> 33:27.000
He's just gonna pop it in his mouth and start screaming.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
I'll do it for you, man.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
In Order of Gender descending.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Oh, God.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
What?

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
You don't know who I'm bringing up first.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
How is that an O?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Oh, because I'm pitting the genders against each other.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Yeah, you can't do that anymore.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
In Order of Gender randomly.

33:46.000 --> 33:55.000
And also, while recognizing that either one of them at any given time,

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
we do not have the right to know what's going on in either of their pants or their brains.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
True.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
And gender shouldn't be a thing.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Why?

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I did it!

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Legalize it!

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Legalize it!

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Legalize it!

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Legalize it!

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Legalize it!

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Legalize it!

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Legalize it!

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Legalize it!

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Legalize lack of gender?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Yep.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
This guy, when you tried to do the butter, he was like,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
He went like that, and then I said,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
sorry, and he went, oh, you're good.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
And I was like, well, you're not then.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
You're not good.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
I don't want to.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Because I thought maybe he was like, I'm in pain.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Stop.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
No.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
But he's just like, no, I'm terrible at your stage dive.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
I don't want to.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
I don't want to do it.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
I wouldn't know how to participate in a stage dive.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
I've only done one.

34:52.000 --> 34:57.000
And I mean...

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
He's too far back, though.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
That's a problem.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Too far back!

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Is that Dave Kline?

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Oh, Dave Kline's here.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
I bet Dave Kline would have you.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
For dinner.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
He's Dracula.

35:11.000 --> 35:16.000
You guys reacted like that was just a Dracula joke.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
All right.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
God damn it.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
Let's bring out our fucking guests.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
You're the host.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
I can't help it.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Did you get control of your own show?

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
I have no idea where the vaginas and penises are

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
on either of them.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Say both at the same time.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
One's a writer.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
One's a...

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I might offend one of them that way, too.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
I don't...

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
They're just nerds doing what we do.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
They're part of our family.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
Let's bring out randomly...

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Amy Berg and Will Wheaton.

35:43.000 --> 36:02.000
I hope you guys like chips.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I'm so glad you didn't eat that.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
Oh, good.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
That's great.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Thank you.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Well, you're going to waste our night, man.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
So what's the worst you've ever seen?

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
You'd be crying.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
You'd have to go to the bathroom.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Really?

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Yeah, you'd be sobbing.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
So they have stuff they make that's like...

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
That's what that is, literally.

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
You would be getting blood for like four hours.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
I just...

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Okay.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
I mean, I don't want the kids.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Food that's based on a dare.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Just go have dim sum.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
So I kept trying to say,

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
I'm not that kind of show kid.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
And he's like,

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
I'm like, your sister told you don't embarrass her.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
And he's like, but she's my sister.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
This is the telekinetic conversation.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Yeah.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Telekinetic.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
We've moved each other's eyebrows.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
So anyways, so last couple of weeks I've had authors on

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
who have books that I've read before the thing.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
And then I walked through the entire book.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
And some people enjoy it and some people don't.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
But I just wanted to like,

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
we could just hang out, right?

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Because I researched your guys' shit today

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
and I'm excited because of that to talk to you guys.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
But I'm hoping we can...

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
I want to hang out and talk nonsense,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
hopefully, for most of the time.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Why did I say that?

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
What are you supposed to do?

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
No, I want to talk about...

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
I'd like to talk about the series issues.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Or the book I...

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I prefer sense.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
But also the thing is,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
I don't know where to start because we have...

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Because there's another friend I want to bring up here tonight.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
I want to check in with him.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
And I'm trying to figure out...

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
I'm not talking about my dick or anything.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Is that why you...

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Oh.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Oh.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Where are they laughing at?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
My hair went up in the air?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
The maybe.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
That's...

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
It looked good.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
That's their deal breaker with my hair?

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
This is the first...

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
Yo, Dan's hair looked like shit tonight.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
It's like he doesn't know how to take care of himself.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
I just couldn't get into the show.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I couldn't get past that.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
I come here from Burbank to...

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
to see a guy whose hair looks good.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Yeah.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
All the time.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
I wanted to see somebody with bad hair.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
I wouldn't have gone to the Hollywood Bowl tonight.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Oh.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Ooh, Hollywood Bowl.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Van Halen.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Ooh.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
These guys, I don't understand them ever.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Almost ever.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Ooh, the Hollywood Bowl.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
But they were really helpful about the chip.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
They were very protective and helpful with the hot sauce.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Yeah.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
You guys were looking out.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
But then you say something like Hollywood Bowl and they're like racist.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
I know.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
It's terrible.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Well...

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
Ooh.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Yeah.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
I don't know.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
I'm assuming with the best of intentions.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
I think they're good kids.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
I think they're going to make a great society.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Yeah.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Yeah.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
You're welcome.

38:34.000 --> 38:40.000
I'm sorry about the earth burning to a cinder when you're 38.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Good luck.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
Seriously, millennials, learn how to swim.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
It is a skill you're going to.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Also, yeah.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
And you know what?

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Forget the apostrophe thing.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
I've been on you for 20 years.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Just forget it at this point.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
You're...

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
You're...

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Who cares?

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
We are going to die.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
It doesn't matter anymore.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
I'm not mad at you anymore.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Who cares?

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Don't learn to spell.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
It would be wasting your time at this point.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
You'd be wasting your time.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
Just keep...

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
So Amy Berg, like a no-necessary order.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
Here's the random things I want to talk to you guys about.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Amy is working on this show right now.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
It's not on yet at all.

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
As you said, you were doing a 10-episode order and then they're going to air it later.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
So I'm assuming this is like some new media thing.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Like this isn't CBS.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
No, it's stars.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
It's premium cable.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Stars, okay.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Premium cable.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
Woo!

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Ooh la la!

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Ow!

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
That means we can have sexy time.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
And swearing, which is more important to me.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
But they killed Party Down.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
They're the worst ever.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Yay!

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Also my favorite.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Racist.

39:59.000 --> 40:05.000
What star slogan?

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
What stars?

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
Where the...

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Watch...

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
Watch...

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
Watch us.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Cause we're...

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
There.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
And we're bright.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
At night.

40:20.000 --> 40:25.000
We put the Z in movies.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
I like it.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
I'll watch them.

40:29.000 --> 40:36.000
Their slogan is because you wouldn't watch writers.

40:36.000 --> 40:42.000
And they just have a picture of us, me and Amy, like with potato chips in our hands.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Because who wants to watch writers?

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Right.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
And then it pans to me and they're like, no, we don't want to watch hit.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
What stars?

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Do we get HBO?

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
Anyways, this show you're working on, I was so excited you just described it.

40:55.000 --> 40:59.000
J.K. Simmons, who's like I've loved since Law and Order.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Since Law and Order?

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
That's your J.K. reference?

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
What is he before that?

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Spider-Man.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Who's Oz, which is an awesome show.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
No, that's after Law and Order though, isn't it?

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Well, that's true.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
Yeah, so I'm OG.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
I got so scared I was going to find out he was Butch Cassidy.

41:19.000 --> 41:24.000
No, I could have sworn there was Paul Newman.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
I thought I was going to get really like shamed for, you know.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
But no, I'm clearly the superior J.K. Simmons fan.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
I was like, who's that guy that they're going to?

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
I hope this person's mentally ill, or at least there's a question of it.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
Because he would play the, because that means we get to see that guy.

41:39.000 --> 41:45.000
Emil Skoda was his character's name, then I saw him in Juno and I was like, I like that guy again.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
I hope he's in all of stuff and then he was.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
That's me.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
So he, we can talk about the show, right?

41:55.000 --> 42:01.000
You said it, it's called Point of Departure, Counterparts, Counterparts.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Counterpart.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Counterpart.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
Yes.

42:04.000 --> 42:09.000
It's about a split universe, but the universe knows it's split.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Yes.

42:10.000 --> 42:16.000
It's like parallel timelines that shared one history, but they actively split and they know they split.

42:16.000 --> 42:22.000
So J.K. Simmons is playing two different versions of himself and it's like a spy Cold War thing going back.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Yeah.

42:23.000 --> 42:30.000
That's my audience.

42:30.000 --> 42:36.000
Just in case somebody wasn't paying attention, maybe repeat that.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Just in case.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
No, their reaction made you think that you should, you should have missed it.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
See, that's what happens when you...

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
I don't know why I'm in this conversation.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
You described it better than I could have, I think.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
That's pretty great.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
This is what I do.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
That's how I interview people.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
It sounds like a really fucking cool show.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
I bring them out and I go, your book's about autism.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
And they go, it is.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
And I'm like, ginkabugabugabugaboo.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
Let's have a hand.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
I'm getting a little sick of myself lately.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Well, I mean, anything else to say about it?

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
You guys are working on it.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
Do you think it's good?

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
You can't say otherwise.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
No, it's actually really good.

43:10.000 --> 43:16.000
There's a genre that they've invented for the show called spy-fi.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
I'll take it.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
I like it.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
No.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
No, no, no.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
You will take it, will we?

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
No, listen.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
I love the genre.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
I love the idea of the genre.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
That name is way too cute.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
I'm not okay with that.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
How is it spelled?

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
The show is not cute.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Well, the why aren't I spy-fi?

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
Yeah, exactly.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Good question.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Do you know?

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
It's who fucking knows.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Okay.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Well, we're going to find out.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
It's going to start out spelled the right way.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
And then right around the time you really get into it,

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
they're going to change the spelling of it.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
And then all the content is just going to go to hell.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
You mean like those fucking Berenstein bears?

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Like the Berenstein bears.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Exactly like them.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Will, have I ever told you about that?

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Yeah.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
No, Will was just going on about that.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
You guys all know about it.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
I've been, I swear to God, five years before this hit the internet,

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
I was like, you guys, they changed the names on the bears.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
And then like now, you know, no one cared or believed me.

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
But now, now fucking everyone's on that goddamn Berenstein bears trap.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
You are like the hipster of Berenstein bears.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Yeah.

44:17.000 --> 44:22.000
Are you, are you, are you being like a reality blurring event hipster?

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Yeah.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
I was there before reality blurred and, you know,

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
no one believed it was blurred.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Yeah.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
But that's the whole point.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
We were all there before reality blurred.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
Which is why we all remember the name being the right way.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
And we know that it's not the way it is now.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Do you guys know what this Berenstein bears thing is?

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
All right.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Then I don't have to explain.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
You can Google it.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Another thing you should.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Your name changed.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
Okay.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
Continue.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Another thing you should goggle is Will's show.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Goggle.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
What are you saying?

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
It's pronounced goggle.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
It always has.

44:51.000 --> 44:56.000
I could have done that for an hour.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
But I'm not that confident.

44:58.000 --> 45:03.000
The, but, but, but at Geek and Sundry is, is your thing,

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
because I know you did that show Caper.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
I watched an episode of that today for, for,

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
and Fleece Executive Produce,

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
because that was on Geek and Sundry and Hulu at the same time,

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
because you guys had to deal with Hulu.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
And is Tabletop on Hulu as well?

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I don't know.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
I think it, you know, I think we talked to them about it.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
I know it's on Netflix, but I don't know if it's on Hulu,

45:22.000 --> 45:27.000
but I do know that it has a huge audience on the pirate bay,

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
which I think is awesome because it lets me know that,

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
like, there's a lot of people that want to watch this,

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
that for whatever reason,

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
I don't know YouTube is blocked in their country or something.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
Oh, yeah.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
That's the geo blocking thing is like explains a lot of the piracy,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
because it's like people don't want to watch a pro commercial,

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
you know, but I just, I think it's cool.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
I think like, like when, when there is,

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
when there's an audience demand for a show that isn't being

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
served in some way and the audience is like,

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
give us the show.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
I mean, like, I love that.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Of course.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
That's what I mean.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
It's like, yeah, how do you feel about piracy?

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
Well, we're supposed to be making things that are basically free

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
and addictive and we're like, we're going to get offended that,

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
yeah, it's dumb.

46:04.000 --> 46:09.000
I view piracy as a failure on behalf of the industry

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
to serve the needs of the audience.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Of course.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
And they would, too, if they knew how to serve them,

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
because then they could charge them.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
Like, like, we were, you know, oh God, MP3 technology.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
Oh my God.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
And then iTunes is like, no, that means now you can listen to music

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
more than ever for a dollar.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
And everyone's like, that's fine.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
And Apple's like, we have a billion dollars.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
And everyone's like, that's fine, too.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
Music industry saved.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
Go, go, go.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
Sorry, we wasted 15 years of your life taking it to the Supreme Court,

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
like we did with cassette tapes before that.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Well, home taping is killing music.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
I've seen the tape.

46:39.000 --> 46:44.000
But anyways, the, the, but you're, the show, Tabletop,

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
like I, I'm like, you turned me around on something.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
It took somebody as passionate as you,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
because there has been this revolution.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
As you say in the show, like once upon a time,

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
there was this thing called D&D.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
And we, like people of our generation were like, oh,

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
the, like the pencils and the dice and the complicated rules

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
and the million books.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
And, and like just the, the Harry Potter,

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
but more complicated of it all.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
That's the secret society of it.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Like the fact that it was the opposite of football,

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
to, including the fact that if you talked about it in front of other people,

47:15.000 --> 47:20.000
they would, they would actually actively like back up from you.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
And that was kind of like part of the appeal.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
And, and,

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
You have completely described my childhood.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
Me too.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Yeah.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
It was, it was like, it was sort of, I mean, it's the same thing.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
That's what kids do.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
If they're going to be exceptional,

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
they have to practice being exceptional in school

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
while the other kids practice being part of a horrible mindless hoard.

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
And, and, and they end up doing great because everything is for them.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
And not a tear in my eye for them.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
But, but, but, but every, the rest of us,

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
and sometimes it seems like the majority of us,

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
like we're also practicing in that grade.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
And we have to practice like fucking not giving a shit.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
And so we, we, this is not my point.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
Your point was like that people like me,

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
I'm one of these people that you were kind of talking about

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
between the lines is like a purist who therefore,

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
when I hear the word tabletop, I'm like,

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
you mean like ever since magic, the gathering,

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
I think was the sort of beginning of it for me.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
My experience was like, wait.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
That's a fine game.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
Well, I mean, that's a look.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
What do you, yes.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Okay.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
What the hell am I in the middle of saying that I was wrong?

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
That it was, but it was like, oh, it's cards,

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
but instead of the thing, you know, it's like,

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
somehow it was wrong.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
But then, so he does this show called tabletop where he like,

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
he just like is just very, very enthusiastic about the million

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
types of games that are sort of like they're,

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
they're halfway between those things that we used to play

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
that are really complicated and things that we remember

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
from, from our other half of our childhood,

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
like Monopoly and like when mom and dad weren't fighting,

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
like the, the shoots and ladders and, you know,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
like, like, like the board, there's, there's something

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
between this, this new era of these thousands of games

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
somewhere between board game and, and, and role playing.

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
It is weird to play ants in the pants without the sound

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
of dishes breaking kitchen.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
That is a, that is a strange experience for me.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
You know, when Felicia asked me if I wanted to do a show

49:04.000 --> 49:08.000
for Geek and Sundry, I said yes because she's,

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
everything that she's done has been really smart

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
and really interesting and, and I love the idea of

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
being able to create and produce in a medium where

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
I wasn't going to be answering to like a network douchebag

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
who didn't understand the audience.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
I did that when I worked with sci-fi.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
But, but with, with, with this show she said,

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
so what do you want to do?

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
And I said, you know, I don't know, I want to do something

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
but I don't know what.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
And she said, well, how about a show where you review,

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
get board games.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
I know how much you love board games.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
And I said, you know, I think honestly the best way

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
to review a board game is to just play the board game

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
and show people how much fun it is and oh, and the,

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
the idea like exploded in my brain.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Like it all came together all at once.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
I will be the first person to say on paper that sounds

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
like a really terrible idea.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
Like, like, you literally play a game with your family

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
for two episodes.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Like it's your family.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
Yes.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
That just sounds like, not really sure where you're going

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
with that.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
You know exactly where I'm going because you know how

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
that sounds on paper.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
Yeah, but my family's red.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
I know it turns out, but it turns out.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
I wouldn't, I wouldn't put my family on my show

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
if they were lame.

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
I'd be like, sorry guys, I'm going to hire some actors

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
to be my family who are lame.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Did you, did you adopt from, from, from Asgard

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
or something?

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Your children are, you're both, you're,

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
you have two boys at that table.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
They both are nine feet tall.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
They, they, they look like, they both look like Thor.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
Yeah.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
In fact, my son Nolan's in Germany right now

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
and people keep coming up to him and taking pictures

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
with him because they're like Thor, Thor, Thor.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
You know, Dave, Dave Kline likes that.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
He's descended from Thor as well.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
It's interesting that you say it sounds like a bad idea

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
because I thought that the success of a show like

50:52.000 --> 50:57.000
Celebrity Poker and, and the success of just shows

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
where you like watch people, you know,

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
you watch people play cards and stuff, I thought,

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
well, this is something that I'm super passionate about

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
and what's going to make this show live is not

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
what's happening on the table.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
It's what's happening with the people around the table.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Right.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
And I was a huge fan of Dinner for Five and I wanted

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
to like put together those two shows and,

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
and have people come in and do, you know,

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
and, and, and just play these games that I love.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Well, it works really well.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
It works, one of the things that makes it work really well

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
is that you, you played this game Dread,

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
which is like this, this indie game that is a stack

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
of things you can't call Jenga.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
Yeah.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
But like, and it's similar to, but legally distinctly

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
different from, from Jenga.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
It's just a collaborative storytelling game where

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
you were walking through players through this scenario

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
and they were like role playing and they had their

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
characters figured out, which were figured out by

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
questionnaires, like psychological profiles that

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
you answer for a fictional character that you make up.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Yeah.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
And, and then you're just going through it and

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
instead of rolling dice, you pull, it sounds a little

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
dumb, but it's like, it works like as a storytelling

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
thing. It's like as, as, at key points of the story,

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
you have to like keep pulling these Jenga blocks out.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
Yeah.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
And then as, as the story becomes more intense and

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
as the stakes get higher and higher and the players

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
are more like their adrenaline is up, the tower is

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
becoming more and more unstable because you're

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
pulling blocks out of it.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
And when the bottom of the tower falls, the player

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
pulling from it dies.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
Right.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Like that's it.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
You're dead.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
And as an actual narrative, it is, it is.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
It's a great metaphor.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
It's inevitable.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
If you're in a movie, you know that this can't last.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
Otherwise it would be a bad movie.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Like this camping trip, someone's going to die.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
And so you can, and when you're in a really scary

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
situation, that's what scares you.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
You feel like something's going to happen.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
That was one of my favorite episodes we've done in

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
three seasons.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
And I'm really, it means a lot to me though.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I'm really glad that you liked it because I wanted

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
to do a thing that was about storytelling.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Right.

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
And because I wanted to, that's because your, your

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
skills as a GM, I thought were astounding in that,

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
in that thing when you watch it.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Like your ability to actually, your, your, your,

52:54.000 --> 52:58.000
your tonality and your pacing and your like making a,

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
it just felt, and then the thing I thought was,

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
holy shit, we got to, we got to play something with Will.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
And it's like, oh, he'll play Shadowrun with us and Amy

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
will play with us and stuff.

53:06.000 --> 53:10.000
But, but also then I thought like the, of this game

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
Werewolf that we always played, that Justin Reiland

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
introduced me to with this stupid deck thing.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
What are you, you don't like, now you don't like Justin?

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
No, I love Justin.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Were you thinking about, were you thinking about

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
the Hollywood Bowl again?

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
No, no, no.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
All right, I'm going to try it.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
Pulling out cards, we're going to play a game.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
It's talk to Amy Berg about writing science fiction

53:36.000 --> 53:40.000
for, for while I write a W on one of these pieces of paper.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
Hi.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
Hi.

53:42.000 --> 53:52.000
So tell us about your science fiction.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Wow.

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
It's very, it has a lot of science in it, and it's made up.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
It's pretty great.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
Awesome.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
You know what, there's people here for this.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Someone do this.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Here, I'm throwing this one away.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
We just got started, Dan.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
One, two, three, four, five.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
DeMorge wasn't here, right?

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
I don't see, DeMorge wasn't here?

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
No?

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Okay.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
All right.

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
I need, I need to, hey, Steve Levy, come out here.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Yeah.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
Wow.

54:20.000 --> 54:26.000
If Jeff were here, he'd say, and the crowd goes mild.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
All right, so first thing I need is for somebody to write

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
one, two, three, four, five, six.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
He's asking you to do stuff.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
No, he's up here playing with us.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
He's playing?

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
Yeah.

54:37.000 --> 54:45.000
I need somebody to turn this wad of envelopes and this pen into six identical sheets of

54:45.000 --> 54:51.000
paper, five of which have a, oh, God damn it.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
What?

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
I'm gonna do it.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
What's that?

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
Yeah.

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
Like five of them will have a V on them, and one of them will have a W on it.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
It's just, it's that simple.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Christ.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
What are you, what are you doing?

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
What are you doing right now?

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
What are you doing?

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
I'm talking under my breath.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
No, you're not.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
You're talking on microphone.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
I know.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
It's the opposite of breath.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Your breath is ruining the world.

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
It's above, it's above my breath then.

55:17.000 --> 55:22.000
Your attitude is, is discouraging and disappointing.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
I like it.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
And you know, I came here tonight with a good attitude.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Your attitude is great.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
This game fucking sucks.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
You like this game?

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
No, I don't.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
You just check out what you're doing.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
I fucking hate this game.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
You just always lose.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
I'd rather play baseball than this shit.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
You go play baseball.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
You play fucking baseball.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Does anybody have a copy of ants in the pants?

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
I feel like I should be playing it right now.

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
This is the reason why I don't like games.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Somebody, somebody just ignore him.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Never.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Six sheets of paper.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Somebody, God damn it.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Five of them have a V.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
One of them has a W.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
Don't fuck around.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
I know those are similar letters.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
It's not going to be,

56:09.000 --> 56:13.000
your joke's not going to land if there's a confusion.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
We might have a good time.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
You're in charge, Dustin, you're in charge.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Because I'm going to GM,

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
even though Will would do a much better job.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
No, I'm awful at running.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
Game master.

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
I'm so much better, you're going to see.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
So, so, what, Dustin, when I cue you.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
I don't want to play.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
How do we know, wait, wait, wait,

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
how do we know who's looking at who

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
when it comes time to kill people?

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Because we're all standing in a line.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
We got to stand to?

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
To play werewolf.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Shut up, nobody has to see you but me.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
Nobody's asking for any of your input on any of this.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
You guys are pissing me off.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
I'm going to fucking like,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I'm going to dig a hole and stick you all in it.

56:56.000 --> 57:00.000
And call it a tabletop game called,

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
fuck the fuck faces.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Like, what the fuck?

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
You're going to dig a hole.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
You two want to talk about it.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
You're going to dig a hole.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Steve Levy, he's going to dig a hole.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
You guys want to talk about hang gliding?

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
You dumb pieces of shit.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
The fuck do you want to do?

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
It's my goddamn show.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
We're going to play fucking werewolf.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
All right.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
And you're making it longer.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
All right, stop yelling.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
Then it would have to be.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
Stop yelling.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
You're hurting his feelings.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
He's already finished.

57:23.000 --> 57:30.000
All right, so anyways, let's have some fun.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
And if it doesn't work, Spencer, I tried something.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
I just want to troubleshoot, you know.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
You shoot yourself, not trouble.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Avoid the problem when it comes up.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
You're mad because you see what's happening.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
I'm threatening you.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
I'm not mad.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
I'm not going to turn this into a whole thing.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
I'm not going to become a Game Master professionally.

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
You're going to become a GM.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
It's going to work.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
And I made up my mind about something, and I'm at a very volatile point in my life.

57:58.000 --> 58:04.000
And Will Wheaton's here, and you guys are fucking around.

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
And that V looks a lot like a fucking W.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
He's looking at the cards.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
He's always cheating.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
He's a GM.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
It's fine.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
I'm cheating.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
I know that I'm going to fucking murder.

58:17.000 --> 58:22.000
This is why I never win, because he cheats all the time.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Yeah, because look at the card.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
I'm going to hold them close to my chest.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
You're not even looking.

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
All right, so Dustin, do you have scary music, like creepy ambient music?

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
Oh, yeah.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
Get ready for some scary music.

58:38.000 --> 58:45.000
I don't suppose you also have kind of nice world of common day music.

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
And we could go back between the two, like when I cue you.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
It'd be really cool if we had Castlevania songs.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
You'd have the day and the night.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
Yeah.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Yeah, man.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
Castlevania.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
You could take a second to fight.

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
Has anybody in this room gotten to the last level of Castlevania?

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
No, man.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
Right?

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
Like, you can't even get past the level with the Medusa heads, right?

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
With the stairs?

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
Fuck those guys.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
Yeah.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Yeah, it's awful, and it's so hard.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
What is he doing?

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
What's he doing?

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
He's handing out the things.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
He's going through with this.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Okay, nobody look at these.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
I mean, you can look at them, but don't look at them.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
Don't show them to other people.

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
Don't let them, sir.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
Don't cheat.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
So you either have a V or a W.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
If you have a W, you're the werewolf.

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
And so everything else is basically kind of a self-explanatory.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
You gave me two.

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
Well, you could pick which one you want.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
What do you mean?

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Does one have a V and one has a W?

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
No, one's blank and one has a W.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
I solved the problem.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
They both have letters on them.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
Okay.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Pick the one you want.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
Start over.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
No, no, we're good.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
We're good.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
You guys are doing this on purpose.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
I'm good.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
You're not good.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
You can't do it that way.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Steve's good.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
No, he's not good.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
No, give me your papers back.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Give them back.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
It has the same letter.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
We're going to have fucking fun tonight.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Give me your papers back.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Give me your shit, give them back.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I'm having a ball.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Piece of shit.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
You were a villager.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Yeah, no, I was.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I knew it.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Who is the werewolf?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I think it was Amy Bird.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Oh, who is the werewolf?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Shut up.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
That's my guess.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Oh, no.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I'm angry with all of you.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Spencer was right about that.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Yeah, no, I know.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I'm really sorry.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Who is the werewolf?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I tweeted Will about this.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I was like, what if we played werewolf?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I was so excited.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
And he's like, I don't know if that'll work.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And I was like, fuck you, Will Wheaton.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Fuck you.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Two.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Fuck you.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
You don't know anything about gaming?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I was a little taken aback by the use of all caps.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And the emojis were very intense.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:53.000
The black Santa means I'm kidding.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I really wish I'd known that six hours ago.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
You guys are texting each other.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Yeah, no, I'm going to text you instead.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Maybe if you had more fun playing games, you could get in on this.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
God damn it.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Thank you, sir.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Never returns my shit texts.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Make it real discreet.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
God forbid this was done wrong.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
All right.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I counted too many.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
That's what happened.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
That's not a werewolf.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
We did it.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
We did it.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Okay.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Have a good night, everybody.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Okay.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
So here we go.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
We're just going to play.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
We're just going to play.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
You know how to play.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
You guys know.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
You guys know what's going on.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Is this a scary music?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
This is ordinary.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
You know stories don't start scary, Amy Berg.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:01.000
You know it starts with the nice version of J.K. Simmons hanging out in his village where we begin our story.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:11.000
It's a village of happy town where everyone makes their own corn and hangs out and likes each other.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:22.000
And people who know each other for 20 years treat each other with respect.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.000
They overcome their compulsions for irony and pettiness.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
And they remember that the town is what's important.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
You're going to eat that chip.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Are we in a neighboring village?

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:50.000
However...

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.000
There's a darkness to every town.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:04.000
A sinister underbelly which kind of sounds like a more of a relaxing quit smoking tape.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
But...

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Which is really sinister if you don't want to quit smoking because you feel like you have to.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000
A part of the town where cravings no longer exist.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Where self-confidence is heightened the following day at work.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Through the use of dark magics.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
And one of the most horrific symptoms of this dark underbelly.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:37.000
The insatiable bloodthirsty lycanthrope.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Otherwise known as the werewolf.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Werewolf?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Here, wolf.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Here in the town of happy town.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
One of these villagers up here is not just a villager.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:58.000
One of you is a fucking monster.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
But during the day you walk around and you hang out and you act like friends.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
And then at night you turn into dickheads.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Monsters.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Monster dickheads.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Because it's not enough.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Everything's going to be eaten and destroyed.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
What do I do in this town?

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Watch everyone to go to sleep.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
That means you close your eyes.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Everyone up here close your eyes.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Am I married?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Lower the lights.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Close the eyes.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Hang your heads down.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
All of you hang your heads down.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Do not be in a position where you would be able to see what any of the other people are doing.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Don't be dicks about this.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Do not fuck me on this.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:53.000
This is a fun game and you're going to have fun and you're going to eat shit and die.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Lower the lights.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Just a little bit.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
We're worried about the cameras.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Okay, I get it.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I get it.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I get it.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I'm covering my eyes.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
You're not talking when you sleep.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
You're a villager and you're sleeping.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.000
And you're all dreaming about corn and villaging.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
But one of you isn't dreaming.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:31.000
One of you spent his day dreaming that he or she was a man or a woman.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000
But that's a different issue that we're not going to tackle with this game because you

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
have a right to think whatever you want.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000
It's absolutely your own thing unless the government tries to step in the way and we'll

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
deal with that together and even the werewolves will help us at that point.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Because there are monsters out there that are scarier than werewolves called bigotry.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Have I said enough of that shit?

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Can we move on?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Jesus Christ, I'm from the 70s.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Man meant person.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
All right, so one of you is a werewolf.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
One of you is a werewolf.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Will the person that is the werewolf very, very carefully indicate to me who you are

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:31.000
as your wolfy, wolfy, wolfiness.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000
This werewolf cannot be quenched by sleep.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
This werewolf needs human flesh.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000
And we'll go out its window into the village and kill one of the villagers.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Who will it be, werewolf?

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Oh, werewolf.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Okay.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Regular music, wake up, wake up everybody.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Oh, it's such a good day to eat some corn and hang out.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Because there's nothing wrong, society's going to keep going the same way it did.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Spencer's dead.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000
He's ripped open by the well and his blood is in the water.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Do I live next door to him?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Yes, I live next door to him.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
So I open up the window and I see him ripped up.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
It's not that much of a role-playing game.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Yes, that's what happens.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Am I close to him?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Spencer, did you do something important in the town?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Oh, yeah, I was, no, there was just villagers and werewolves.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
All right, fade down the music a little.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Turns out I don't miss you then.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000
You guys have a serious problem because I'm the doctor of this town.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
And I recognize this as werewolf bites.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
That means that one of you is a werewolf.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:12.000
And that means you've got to figure out, you've got to, before sundown, you've got to hang somebody.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
You have to kill somebody that might be the werewolf.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Yes, Rob?

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
If he was bit, doesn't he turn into a werewolf?

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000
He was bit all the way to death.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
He was eaten.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
It's not like a vampire.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
It's not like a vampire, though.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Well, it is.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Except there's biting involved.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And sometimes you turn into the thing that bit you, but that's also...

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I saw a thing once where a vampire turned into a werewolf.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Who's right? You or the movie I watched?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Why am I, why is it either of those?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Why do I have to be against this movie?

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:01.000
If a werewolf bit a vampire is immortal, then I would understand if a werewolf bit a vampire,

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
then obviously the vampire would turn into a werewolf vampire.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I have no quarrel with the writer of that.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Okay, okay, I just want clarification.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Roger Corbin says thank you.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I thought we were talking about underworld.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I'll take a side of that beckon sale for my...

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I was going to do a word play.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
I'll go take a...

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Put some of those beckon sales on my boat.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
They can blow me around.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
50% off on that beckon sale.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Those sales are beckoning meh.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
All this week of beckon sale.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Figure out who's the werewolf.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I know the werewolf is.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
You're fucking dead, shut up.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
How do you think I know?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
That's what I'm saying.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.000
He's talking, you know, he seems alive.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Who do you think is the werewolf?

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
There's only four of you.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
9-11.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
It's 9-11.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Oh shit.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Which is the other answer.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
I know, there are other things more important than werewolves.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Bigotry in 9-11.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
We get it.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
I feel like there was something I was supposed to remember about this.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Alright, who's the werewolf?

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
You guys are ruining the game by not guessing.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Why did you fucking look at me?

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
It would be amazing if it were you, Schrab.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
It would be amazing.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I want to vote for you to be the werewolf just because it's poetically perfect.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Oh no, maybe Will Wheaton's the werewolf.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Oh, maybe I am the werewolf and I'm trying to throw suspicion off from me.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Yeah.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Or maybe you're the werewolf and you're trying to throw suspicion onto me.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Could be, but- You were the first one to look at me.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Me?

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Yes.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I just love you.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Do you love him enough to eat him to death?

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Like you ate Spencer to death?

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
You're pretty vocal.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Well, yeah.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I think Steve's getting really defensive right now so he's clearly the werewolf.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Oh man, you're going to be so wrong.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Alright, I don't know how the process should work.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I'm the kind of three everyone pointed who they think the werewolf is.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
One, two, three.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Oh man.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Oh shit.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
You guys dragged Steve Levy into the courtyard.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Oh, take off his pants, man.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And you take off his pants and you-

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Take off that pants, man.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Scary music.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Yeah.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Low lights.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Low lights.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Take off his pants.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Make it all six in.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And you hang him.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Yeah.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
You hang him and he dies.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Yeah.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Oh, we hang him.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
But as he dies-

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Oh, look at the pants are all-

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
He doesn't turn back into-

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
He doesn't turn into briefly into a werewolf

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
and then turn back into a person and say thank you,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
which is what werewolves do when they die.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
No.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
He simply hangs there and dies.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
And I, the doctor go up and I feel his foot and I go,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
this guy was human.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Why did you feel his foot before we hung up?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Because you can't tell unless the foot is dead.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Why?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Are you a doctor?

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
You-

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
You hanged me.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Schrab.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Well, if I knew feeling the foot was an option,

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
we would have-

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
You can only do that after they're dead.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Now three villagers remain.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And one is a werewolf.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Close your eyes and go to sleep, villagers.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I'm not tired.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
I want to wake because somebody just got fucking mauled and hung.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
You think I'm gonna sleep in this shit?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Fuck that, man.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I'm just sleeping.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
My eyes open.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Yeah, I'm with Rob.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Yeah, we're gonna stay up all night.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
All right, fine.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Stay up all night.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Fine, stay up all night.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Okay.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Fine, that's what you do.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Yeah, silver bullet.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
You stay up all night.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Silver bullet.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Turn the daylight music back on.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
You stay up all night.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
So obviously one of you is still a werewolf

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
that just stayed up all night with you.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
And now you have to live tired with a werewolf all day again.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Shit, I gotta-

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
You sleep.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Now you're fucking tired.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
And we can do that over and over all week.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
You do it for a thousand years.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000
You don't sleep.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Eventually you sleep.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Everybody sleeps.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
All right.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
You're going to sleep.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
All right.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Now put the scary music on.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
All right.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
We're gonna have fucking fun.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
You're losing the audience.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
You're losing the audience.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I'm not losing.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
That guy has to take a shit.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Okay.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Scary, scary fun.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Fun, scary music.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Uh-oh.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Batman.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Okay.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
All right.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
I want you to tell all your friends about me, he says.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Batman, we lost Batman.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Why did he do anything?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
He's the first guy you'd lose in a nuanced thing.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Two people have died already.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Well, he can.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
He's like, I'm gonna go do something about this.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Go to sleep.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Maybe Batman's the werewolf.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
All right, I'm tired.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I gotta get up and work in the morning.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Go to sleep.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Close your eyes.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
And hang your heads.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Oh, God.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
If you don't like the game, the best way to finish it is to do it.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000
So fine.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Go to sleep.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
It's very upset with all of you.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Except, I don't know, well, Will and Amy have been fine.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
And Steve.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Really, it's Schrab, obviously.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
And a little bit, Spencer, for egging you on.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I'm trying to help.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I don't...

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Thank you for driving me around for two years.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I love it.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I'm trying to fucking sleep here.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Shut the fuck up.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
All right.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
You slept to sleep.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Yeah, Schrab slept us up all night last night.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
It's fucked.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
It's hard to sleep, even though you're tired.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
So fucking tired of this game.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
You know, there's no game.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000
You're in the game, so you don't know there's a game.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
That would be unmarketable.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Oh, that canine thirst for blood.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Oh, that lupine hunger for the kibble

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:11.000
that cannot be provided by name brand products.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Oh, wherewolf awake and indicate to me

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000
who you are going to eat next.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:35.000
I think I understand.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
All right, normal music and daylight.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000
You guys wake up.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
I'm still fucking alive.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
And you're still tired because you wasted that whole night

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
and it didn't help anything because now

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
I was strangled with typewriter ribbon

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
next to a half finished TV pilot

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
that would have been fucking great.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Oh, shit.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
It could be me.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I could be a TV pilot writer.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Is it me?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Oh, shit.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
We all know fully well the best writer up here

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
is Amy Burke.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Now slain by wherewolf.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Eaton.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Eaton devoured.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Her bones licked clean.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Yeah.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Your fault, kind of.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
No.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
How is it my fault?

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Because you fucked around.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Instead of playing the game, which you now have to do,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
it's a matter of life or death.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
There is, wait.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Wait, how do you outvote each other?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000
There's two people.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Oh, you idiot.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
You lost.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Well, Eaton's the werewolf.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Fuck you.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
You lost.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
And that's fun.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
But the day.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
That was a fun game.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000
I had a lot of fun playing that game.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Eat the chip if you hate everything so much.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
No, I'm not going to eat the chip.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Yeah, everyone wants you to do it now.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Eat the chip.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Eat the chip, you pussy.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Now I'm not going to eat the chip.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I was going to wait for it to be really, really funny,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
and now I'm not going to even wait.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Yeah, but it's Chekhov's chip, man.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
He's right.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
It's Chekhov's chip.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
It's been there since the first act.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
He read Chekhov's chip.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Rob loves reading.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:26.000
That's why he loves me.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
That's right.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Because you went to art school.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Right.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
And I went to writing school.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
You went to word school.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And I went to word school, and you went to art school.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Rob, when I met Rob, one of Rob's big pet peeves

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
was the word utensil, which he swore was invented

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
by smart people to make him feel stupid.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Writing utensil.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Writing utensil.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Well, yeah.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Because the word is utensil.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Excuse me, could I have a writing utensil?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Just say pencil.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Maybe you don't want a pencil.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Then say that.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
But what if they're both there?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Then say what you want.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
What if you don't know what to do?

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000
What if you don't know what you want?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Maybe you want to be polite because you're talking

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
to someone who's not that smart.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Can I have a writing utensil?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
OK.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000
All right.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Well, now, do you hate instrument just as much?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
No.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I'm fine with that.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Writing instrument doesn't bother you?

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
No.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Writing utensil.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Could I have a writing utensil, please?

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Just say pencil, dude.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
I don't know.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I might be hashtag team Rob tonight.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Well, he's always more entertaining,

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
but it's because he's disruptive.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
He waits until something's happening,

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
and then he disrupts it.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
That's like a luxury for him.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
You know, it's like, if you sit around, everybody.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Ah!

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Yeah, must be nice having that job.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
He's like Pizza Hut's Noid.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Was it Domino's?

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Was the Noid from Domino's?

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Do you know the reason why they stopped doing the Noid?

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Because people didn't know?

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
No, no, no.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Does anybody know why?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Oh, yeah.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Oh, yeah.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Do you know, sir?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Stand up and tell the Wikipedia.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I think there was a dude who's actually named Noid.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.000
He was paranoid that Domino's was talking to him.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Right.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Yeah.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
And he went into...

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000
The guy said, for those who didn't hear it,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
there was a guy whose name was Noid

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
who thought that Domino's was like fucking with him.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
He was talking to him through the television,

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
so he went into a...

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
not a Pizza Hut, the other one.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
With a machine gun, thank you.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
And started killing people.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
We have one fucking story in America

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
that doesn't end with someone taking a gun somewhere

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
and fucking murdering people.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I'm so fucking sick of this story.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Do you know there's one like...

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
What is it, 95 this year?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
That's why we lost the Noid.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
That's why we lost him?

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Fuck that guy.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Yep.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I don't know.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
The Noid was the one thing that couldn't possibly

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
have had anything to do with a mass shooting.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
That's why you loved it.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
You were like, this is safe.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Not anymore, apparently.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
But how many is it this year, Steve?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
How many school shootings?

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Well, it was 45 school shootings.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
In a year!

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
And now we're making fun of like, you know...

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Not even, it's...

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Jeb Bush didn't know what school we were talking about.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
It's like, well, come on, it's getting to the fucking point

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
where the obscene thing is that it's hard to keep track.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
It's a goddamn epidemic.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
I don't know what my point is.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I'm not in a soapbox.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
There's no one on the other side of this issue.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I mean, there are.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
By the way, we'll have a conversation about that,

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
because I want to say, without...

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
obviously, not a gun nut, not a guy who's like...

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
and it's hard to get into this conversation

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
because everyone's hyper-vigilant

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
against which person are you.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
But speaking as a person who just wants everyone

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
to stop dying and is absolutely fine

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
with any legislation we need to make happen,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000
whatever makes people feel fine,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
because I've given up on this earth anyway.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
It's not like I've got to make sure that Constitution

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
is upheld perfectly.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
I don't give a fuck about you morons.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
I'm not...

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Fuck you.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I'm just kidding.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I love you, but...

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I was given a hard time during that werewolf game

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
by all of you.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
And just like...

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
I don't want any of you to get shot,

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
but I also don't care about your Constitution.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Okay, so...

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
We're focused on this legislative issue.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
We're like...

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Obviously, if you are a person who's been saying

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
for 30 years we need to mitigate this

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
legislatively every time one of these things

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
happens, obviously it's going to be

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
like a big fucking rage-full

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
moment, and obviously

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
if you're somebody that's always

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
worried that someone's going to come take their guns,

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
then you're going to play the other part

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
and all this stuff.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
But just outside of that Heathcliff fight

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
with the claws going around,

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
like the...

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Thank you, Will Wheaton.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I love that image so much.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
The...

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Hashtag in our rage.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
The...

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Are we going to...

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
What are we going to do?

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
What is step two in a hypothetical universe

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
where we would say to all...

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
The guns are in circulation in the last 30 years.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Like, we're going to be all dead shot or not.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Like, we're all going to be dead before

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
legislation would stop the insanity.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
There are more guns in America than there are

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
people.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Yeah, so...

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
So is there another step to this?

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Or are we...

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
No, we're not ever going to do anything about it

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
because we sat by as a nation and allowed

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
a classroom full of six-year-olds to be

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
murdered and then would not

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
even at a legislative level

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
do the most fucking useless

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
thing that could possibly have been

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
reasonably passed.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
We as a nation would know it's way more

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
important that we jerk off our guns

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
than our kids go to school without ever

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
having to worry about dying.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
I go into a movie theater and wonder,

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
well, am I going to be another? I mean,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
am I going to be on the news now?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Because fucking gun nuts, like,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
have created this delusion in their life

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
that, like, the president is going to walk

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
up to their house and go, give me your guns

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
unless you have a lot of them.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Right.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
It's insane.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
But we know that

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
that's never going to happen because we're going to keep

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
sure, because it's like a football game where we just keep...

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
But it's almost like our Ouija board

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
or something where people want to just go like this.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
I'm not saying that neither side wants a resolution,

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
but I am saying, like,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
not only would you need to then

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
have one of those teams win,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
but then also in addition

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
to that, you'd need definitely something else.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
What is that something else? Does anyone

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
have a fucking idea?

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Because, like, if you

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
make guns completely illegal

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
to the point where

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
the image of one

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
is banned

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
and everyone's home is

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
searched and you gather them all, there's still going to be

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
so many guns.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
And is this

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
a mental health issue?

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
It goes so much beyond this, right?

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Is it some kind of, like, national psyche thing?

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Like, no one ever...

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
What the hell are we supposed to...

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
We're nuts. We're obviously

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
a million insane people collectively, right?

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I'm so angry about it

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
that it's not possible for me to be rational.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I mean, I'm so

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
like, just blind rage,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
fuck everyone who has a fucking assault rifle.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
You're being more rational than I am,

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
because you're able to have the rationality

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
about the legislative thing,

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
at least to be able to look at that.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I'm being less rational because I'm going like,

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Jesus fucking Christ, we're so fucked.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
We're just so much

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
unlike any country in the world.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
And when a presidential candidate

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
responds to a shooting

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
like the one we just had by saying,

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
stuff happens,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
we are beyond fucked.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
There's no way out.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
So are we...

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Isn't it the absolute only

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
solution you could possibly think of?

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
There's no economic solution,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
there's no legislative issue.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
First of all, you do background

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
checks, restrict who could get guns,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
just make it a bit harder.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Any of that at all. I mean, there's not none of that.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
But it's not good at all.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Second of all, stop the manufacture

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
of certain types of guns or new guns.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
You don't have to take people's guns away.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
You just stop new ones. Third of all,

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
you could do a trade-in program

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
offer cash for guns. It's proven to work.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
You know, get more guns off the streets.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
And I mean, a combination of those

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
options and then ratcheting them up,

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
that would work. It would just take

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
a lot of separate programs

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
working independently and together

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
to try to make it happen. And that's what's impossible.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
People to pass any

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
of those legislative measures is impossible.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Yeah, no, I know. I'm saying that's how you do it.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Not how it will be done.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
And do you think that's going to happen?

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
It's going to happen at a state level.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
And it'll be like, you know,

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
anyone who thinks that it's a good

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
idea to vote for any of the people

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
in the GOP clown car,

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
have to only look at

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
what Brownback did to Kansas,

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
which is like

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
they're basically turned an American state

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
into Somalia. And they're

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
just like created this

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
libertarian paradise for businesses.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
And it's ruined the economy for every other person

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
there. It's easily

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
like just all you have to do is look at

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
the numbers before Brownback was elected

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
and after. And you can't

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
just you can't deny the data.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
And in counties and places

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
where there are more gun laws, there's fewer

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
gun deaths. So if you could do it

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
at a state level and then say like,

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
you know, it'd be great if it was California,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
then there's, you know,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
there's not as many gun deaths

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
or this is working.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Then you start to put pressure on

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
you know, candidates to get it to go.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
But you still have one entire

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
half of the political

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
environment who refuses to accept

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
that global warming is a thing.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
I mean, like it's

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
you know, like there, if

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I was four looking at the moon,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
you know, they would be like, well, we can't look at the moon

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
anymore.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Because lip tards, look at the moon.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Lip tards?

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Oh, lip tards. Yeah.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Oh, lip tards. Oh, Jesus.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Okay. It's one of their more clever

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
lip tards.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I went to you.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
They suck, right?

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Do you think that

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
do you think the internet has made it has made this

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
this this political like this

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
by this bunch of lip tards

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
out there? Do you think we've become

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
worse or better? I guess we

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I think it's both because we have so much

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
now it's just like you just anonymous

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
like I can't watch out. You can't watch a music

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
video with like underneath it.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
It's just like people devolve into some

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
crazy heated fucking like

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
two party culture war

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
about something it doesn't necessarily

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
be it's not as like gun control underneath

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
a Madonna video, but it's like if unless she has

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
a gun in the video or like like Madonna

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
was an artist in the 80s.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
She was

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
she was also an author did a great art

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
book about naked people called sex.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Yeah.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
I wonder whatever happened to her.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
But I guess it doesn't matter.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
It's like because there's just as many

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
it's it's it's every every medium brings like

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
more good and more bad. It's just fucking like

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I don't know what my point is. We got to get out of here.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
We got to get I got to get back to making a

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
rocket ship. We're going to get out of here.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I'm going to talk to Elon Musk and see if you can do us a solid.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
So I'm tired of waiting for

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
I can't I'm not going to come up with this shit.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
They invited us from Geek and Sundry to go

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
have a tour of the SpaceX facility.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Yeah. So we're going like

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
in like yeah we're going in like I think it's like

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
a month from now I get to go and

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
actually why no right I'm very excited

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
and go see the whole thing.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Steve told me that the Tesla has

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
an Armageddon feature on it.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Yeah right it's got the like bio

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
it's something

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
an apocalypse button.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Just in case

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
you're in the apocalypse

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
what it does is it

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
makes the apocalypse happen.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
No. Why do we have that?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
If there's a zombie apocalypse

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
or if there's like a airborne virus

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
and it's like killing everybody off

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
I don't know why this is in the car

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
but you press the button and it

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
pressurizes the cabin of the car

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
so that no air from the outside can get in

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
and then it has a filter

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
that filters

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
the air from the outside and cleans it

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
so that you're safe.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
It's an underwater button.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
It's just going to be great to be in a car

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
with somebody on a road trip who's just

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
farting a lot.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
It's going to be great to be in a car

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
in a guy's Tesla when the world ends

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
to that degree.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
I'm sure you're going to be alive for the next hour

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
like oh everyone but me can breathe

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
like you're not going to be like

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
people are going to be applauding and waving at you

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
look at him he bought a Tesla good for him

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
my children are dying

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
I'm not going to figure out if that glass can break

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
I'm going to

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I'd feel terrible he seems

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
like he's had a rough life

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
but he'll be alive for the next 300 miles

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
so that's

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
unless there's no internet don't those cars

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
not start if there's no internet

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
don't they need to like check in with the website

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
and

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I don't know that maybe that's a myth I guess

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
if it has an apocalypse mode somebody

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
check to see if it can start without the internet

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
it's not like an electronic arts game

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
like

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
it's like

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
they're afraid you're going to copy the car

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
so that's like

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
there's a root kid in my Tesla

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
there's a root kid in my Tesla

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
there's one other thing

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
there's one other thing

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I would talk about which is

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
this weird thing I noticed because

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
you've been around I've been to your Twitter buddy

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
for years and

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
what's that like

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I just ignore him

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
it's illuminating actually

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
I know you're on his side tonight

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
but I'm a good person too

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
and

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
what's it like to kind of have your

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
identity like all of a sudden

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
you

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
writers are not pretentious people

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
you're even less so than me

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I'm one of these assholes that's like

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
my name's Dan Harmon

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
as unpretentious people

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
all we have is our name

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
and your name has always been Amy Berg

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
the WGA has you registered as Amy Berg

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
and there's this director

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
now she's not

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
out of kindergarten but she just started

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
she just joined the DGA and now her name is Amy Berg

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
and she's just like Amy Berg

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I saw you on Twitter going no I didn't

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
she makes movies

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
and you're like answering questions

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
well it would be awesome if all she did

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
was win awards

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
she tends to get into

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
trouble a lot and there's like

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
you know

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
like on the top of

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
all these websites that

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
everyone who would ever employ me

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
see like the name like

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
SAG-AFTRA I want to file suit against

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Amy Berg and I'm like no it's not me

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
it's not me

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
but yeah she's a documentary

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
director and

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
she refuses to use her

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
middle initial like everyone else in the town

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
does when they have you know someone else

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
who has the same you know like P.T. Anderson

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
probably doesn't prefer to be called P.T.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
but he has to because there's another Paul Anderson

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
but she

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
she's refused to and

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
you know because she doesn't technically have to

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
because it's the DGA and I didn't

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
even realize the DGA and the WGA

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
don't crossover like that

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
it's just that they have been automatically for 80 years

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
like no this is

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
the first time anyone's just been like fuck it

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
I don't care

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
which is I mean I don't want to throw

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
her under the bus I don't know if she's a good person

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
or bad person but I'm like holy shit

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
I'm sure she is a good person

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
you know it's problematic

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
because like there's a tension that falls

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
on me both positive and negative

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
that you know kind of sucks

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
and it's not my responsibility to tell

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
the audience that that's not me

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
that's her and

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
you know it's just a pain in the ass

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
what do we do

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
you should have

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
a boxing match

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
and you fight her should we egg her house

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
well you can't say it

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
it's too late oh yeah

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
well let's

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I'm going to hand out six sheets of paper one has an egg on it

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
one of us is going to go egg her house

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
did you like it Rob when we

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
stopped playing where we started talking about gun control

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
did you like that yes I loved it

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
yeah you love politics don't you you little

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
piece of shit I'm not a piece of shit

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
you are a piece of shit I am not a piece of shit

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
you are you are a piece of shit no

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000

I am not a piece of shit you're a piece of shit

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I'm a really good person

I'm not

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
a piece of shit

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
I'm not a piece of shit

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
you're a piece of shit

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
you're a piece of

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
shit calling someone else a piece of shit it doesn't

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
mean anything a piece of shit could call licorice

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
candy and it doesn't matter yeah

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
you're licorice

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000

pumpkin pie

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
pumpkin pie

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
it was in the fridge and they don't care

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
because it's still good your mom didn't mind

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
she came out of a can

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
that's right she didn't

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
mind how old my pie was

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
your mom didn't

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
so you

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
do you guys want to play shadow run with

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
we're gonna get sued

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
we're gonna get sued no we're not gonna get sued

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
why aren't we getting sued because we don't ever play

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
for more than 10 actual minutes no one cares

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
I will take all the heat

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
why wouldn't we get sued

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
just don't even talk about it

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
how could we get sued

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
tonight we're supposed

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
to play for 10 minutes

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
we're contractually obligated to play for 10 or less

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
minutes of a non fantasy role

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
let's just talk really slow

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I'm starting now

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
aren't you proud of me this is responsible

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
of me I would be if we weren't

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
contractually obligated to play

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
we're gonna get distracted by a topic

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
as we hand out the character cheese

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
alright alright how is

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
your family I watched

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
them on on you know what playing

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
mice and mystic mice

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
what was it mouse and mystics mice and mystics

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
which seems like an interesting table

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
time game where's your wife seems like

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
like I saw like from what I've seen

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
it's like like where did you meet her

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
I met her because what you're actually saying

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
is she's way too

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
how did that happen

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
this is a thing that I wrestle with

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
all the time

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
it's possible what I was gonna say was worse than

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
that but that's not what I was gonna say

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
very very handsome

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
luminary and an intellect

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
I would I would assume that you would have a wife

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
that was like a

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
wish anything less for you than

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
an Amazonian statuesque

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
princess

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
with a body that never quits

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
you just described my wife

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
she is

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
the best part of being me

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
really she is

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
seriously

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
and I wrestle with it all the time

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I feel like I got

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
not that hard Dan

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
he's making that personal

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
yeah it's weird like I have

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
imposter syndrome in like everything that I can do

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
and I like

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I don't understand how I like have somehow

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
tricked her to stay with me for 20 years

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
but it's working

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
she's into those games

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
you know what's interesting is that

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
she doesn't like doesn't like all the games that I like

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
there's like some like really strategic games

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
that she has an example with

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
she doesn't like agricola

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
she doesn't like Puerto Rico

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
she doesn't like power grid

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
but she loves ticket to ride

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
and she loves blockus

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
and she really liked my mystics

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
even though she could not

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
remember how many dice she was supposed to roll

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
and when she was supposed to roll them

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
it's one of those weird things like when you were talking

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
about not remembering people's names

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
I have the same problem

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
and there's people that I've known for a really long time

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
but I know them situationally

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
and I don't know what their name is

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
and now it's too late to ask

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I'm an asshole I've been like being like

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
hey man for like

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
that guy's been standing there behind that camera

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
for 12 years

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
and he's like he's always running

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
he runs the show

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
he's there running those cameras

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
hey we haven't met what's your name

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
I knew that

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
okay see there I just did you saw

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
thanks for standing there for 12 years

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
this is one of the great tricks

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
that my wife does

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
is I'll be like oh fuck I can't remember this guy's name

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
and she'll go hi I'm in what's your name

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
oh you got me you got it

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
I had a girlfriend that did that

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
and she and but I still I was so

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
I'd become so good at

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
masking

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
like I just have these like

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
you know I just living that life my whole life

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
so when I see people I'm just always

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
I'm not saying like I'm a

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
I'm just so used to it I was like hey oh yeah

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
I'm like I kind of like

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
if I think you might be one of two people

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
I kind of have a conversation

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
that kind of applies to both people

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
sure yeah

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
so you get to a point on the dialogue tree

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
to make a choice exactly

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
and I've there was a girlfriend

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I explained this to and she had heard the NPR

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
story and prosopagnosia

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
or whatever it was and she was like oh if that's a real

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
thing then that's cute I'll I'll help you out

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
and I'll like and she would like always

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
like do that that thing

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
but then one time I was like doing it so

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
I was like talking to a guy at the editor

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
awards who had a beard and a baseball

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
cap and a tuxedo and glasses

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
and it was like gee like

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
like you either edited the Sarah Silverman

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
program or the

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Community Christmas episode I have no idea

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
so I just I talked to him for 25 minutes

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
about things that were true regardless of which

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
person he was

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
unfortunately things like I really

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
enjoy working with you I really respect

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
you a lot which are all true

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
for both people but also things

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
that if 25 minutes later you find

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
out I don't know who you are you're gonna be

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
really really bummed out

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
because you're not gonna think any of it was true

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
and and I did that

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
the whole time and then my girlfriend who was

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
listening to the whole conversation

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
was just also convinced

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
and so she's like I'm sorry what's your name

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
and I'm sorry she didn't say

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
that she's like Dan are you gonna

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
introduce us

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
and I was like ahhh

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
and I just went this is

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Garrett and he went oh no

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
no

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
no

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
no no

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
no

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
man or whatever

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
and I'm like I'm so sorry

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
I'm so sorry

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
he's like it's okay it's alright

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
it's okay it's okay it's alright

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
and he walked off to win an editor's award or something

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
and I was like I'm just

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
staring at the table my girlfriend was like I'm so sorry

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
I'm so sorry I didn't know I thought you knew him

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
I'm like you're supposed to think I know him that's what I'm good at

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
he's like help me

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
it's a disease

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
dude I have a worse

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
story than that because I have the

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
herpes

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
she just drops the mic

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I'm out

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I have the unfortunate combination

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
of having a terrible memory and

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
vapid overconfidence

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
to where like you know I will

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
I just think I know

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I just know I know someone and I once

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
introduced someone to an ex-boyfriend

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
by the wrong ex-boyfriend

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
and he was like

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
I need to purse that for a second

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
you introduced someone to an ex-boyfriend

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
yeah I thought he was a different

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
ex-boyfriend

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
so I called him by the wrong name

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
and he said

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
actually it's Matt we've slept together

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
but you're like I knew we slept together

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
I just didn't know which

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
I was not confused by that part

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
I've slept with a lot of people

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
this part of the story

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
is not in dispute

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
you just didn't do it very

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
remarkably

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
now Steve I remember

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
he had the feathers

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
not as a tool

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
he was a shaman

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
don't shake your head at me

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
I'm not shaking my head at you

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
yeah you are

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
eat the chip

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
eat the chip

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
eat the chip

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
eat the chip

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
eat the chip

so did I

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
why would you grow

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
hate this generation I hate your generation

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
you're a terrible terrible people

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
you make everything worse

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
you don't understand

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
self deprecation or dry comedy

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
or irony at all you're terrible

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Seinfeld was right about you

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
and he's the one who said it wasn't funny

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
when kramer was on letterman apologizing

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
and he was wrong about that

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
he was right about you

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
you're bad unfunny people

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
seek yeah thank you

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I like you

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
nice try nice try

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
seek how are you seek for new listeners

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
so you don't have to go back all the way through

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
multiple aneurysm survivor

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
which is

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
which is like

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
sounds kind of

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
more positive than multiple aneurysm non-survivor

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
but and yet carries with it

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
this life of uncertainty

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
and you

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
the last time we saw you you were

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
finishing up various projects but you had most importantly

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
made this life decision where you weren't gonna keep doing these

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
like medical things and we check in with you

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
from time to time and what's what's going on

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
you talk instead of me

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
all right I'd cliff note version

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
I'll try not to be too sad but

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
so

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I left the doctors I kind of

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
went off on my own I still see

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
one doctor

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
you know time to get checkups

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
I'm on my 12th aneurysm

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
in my head right now

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
and but for the most

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
part I'm doing a little bit better

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
do you mean it's happening right now

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
I mean I think most of us

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
I'll speak for myself like the word

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
aneurysm sounds like explosion which

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
you mean you're on one?

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
yeah so it's in my head and they put

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
coils in it and that's to

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
kind of deflate it

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
so that the blood can... is that something that's happened

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
since we last talked to you?

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
yes oh okay so you're going to somebody

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
that's still checking and able to see

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
these things okay sorry

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
so to backtrack

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
the one thing I want to talk about was a

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Kickstarter project that you guys all helped me fund

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
and how important it's been

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
to my progress

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
but to get there real quickly

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
back before I started the project

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
I was

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
I was kind of told around

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
2013 when I first was in a hospital in

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
2010 that the

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
some of the procedures I went through

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
they don't know the long term effects of them because they were new procedures

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
so we weren't sure

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
if I would survive past

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
a couple years and so

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
I think subconsciously I was

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
ready to go at any time

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
so I did

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
like the book soul star and then we put it online

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
and we you know we're trying to

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
you know get out there try to raise money for the aneurysm foundation

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
the book didn't do well

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
so then I

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
faced like my first

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
you know failure in a way

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
and then as that kind of fed

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
it started to

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
where I was waking up like hey another day

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
you know another day is another gift

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
and then I guess like most people

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
as you get older you get jaded and cynical

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
and I had to go from

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
being essentially an infant

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
when I had my aneurysm for not talking and not walking

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
and relearning all that

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
and then in the span of three years

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
get back into a 32 year old's body

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
so my life went hyper fast

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
so once I hit that wall

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
and things were going slow

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
reality really hit me and I wasn't really

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
coping with things very well

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
so I tried to take my own life

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
this has happened

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
you really made that effort

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
oh yeah I mean I had not a good

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
effort I just have I was on a lot

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
of pills at the time so I just took a bunch

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
of them and then the shitty part was

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
that I obviously it didn't work

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
and the next day I woke up really

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
sick and my stomach and chest were hurting

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
and I didn't have the money to go to the hospital

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
so I had to just

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
tough out some of the pain

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
and then

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
after that time is when I started

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
talking to my mom again

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
and I figured well okay

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
now I know what the bottom looks like

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
let's try to

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
build from that let's try to see

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
where I can go

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
so I started becoming friends with my mom again

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
which was nice and then I got to see

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
her last Christmas for the first time in a while

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
and now she currently

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
helps me hunt down Star Wars figures from the new movie

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
she's like she's at Walmart

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
like I'm at Walmart do you want one

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
because we're rednecks

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
and she

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
so then

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
what happened was I did this project that I honestly

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
thought no one would care about

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
and then you guys all funded it

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
in like a day

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
so I'm sorry I see you guys

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
I need to make get this clear

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
because the timeline of this is were you just catching

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
this up because when you've talked

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
to us in the past you're like you had reforges

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
relationship with your mom are you talking about this suicide attempt

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
this isn't the thing that has happened

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
that's new to listeners of our show

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
it's new to listeners of the show

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
but I haven't told it on the show

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
but it predates your reconciliation with your mom

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
and stuff like that

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
it was like last February

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
yeah last February

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
sorry I just wanted to make that clear

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
just because people like

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
they listen and they hear your story and they want to check

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
yeah no I'm glad I don't think linearly

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
so it's good thank you

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
yeah you're a fucking messy asshole

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
get your

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
fucking suicide right

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
fucking

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
when did it happen you piece of shit

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
you would Schrab

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
fucking

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
sorry

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
so

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
now he's good cop

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
now

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
instead of bad person

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
it's his usual role

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
that's okay Dan it's alright

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
so this project

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
I wanted to do you know I lost a lot of the

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
visual and creative side of my brain

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
I used to I moved out here to want to be a comic

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
book artist when I first moved out here

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
and then I lost a good chunk of that

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
so I started you know but I still want to

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
be a storyteller so I started writing

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
and I thought well what if I did an art

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
book like what would that look like

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
someone who can't

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
doesn't know what an apple looks like unless he's looking at one

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
what does someone like that create

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
and then as I was going through it

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
some

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
of my visual memory started to come back

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
and then I started remembering like my life

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
and then on top of the worst part

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
about that was that I could also remember

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
things like dreams and I couldn't

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
differentiate what was a dream and what was

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
what actually happened to me

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
because all the visuals were just coming

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
like tidal wave after tidal wave

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
and so instead of letting that

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
continue to depress me

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
what I did was I put it into the book

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
so this book I created called Alon

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Vitao that you guys all help fund

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
thank you

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
it started off really small

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
but then because you guys funded it so quickly

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
and we raised almost double what I

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
intended I wanted to make it twice

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
a special and I wanted to make it a love letter

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
to Harmontown and

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
the people that come here

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
so the book is about a robot

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
who

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
was struggling with emotions and

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
he

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
at some point in his life

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
he started once a scientist

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
gave him a soul and then he had

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
to struggle with the memories that came

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
with that soul and then when it

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
ends up happening is he

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
like all good robots will do

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
he wiped out humanity

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
and then

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
but the thing is he regrets it

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
he misses us and so

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
this book is his digital

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
journal so there will be a small

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
print run but mostly it's a digital book

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
so as you're going through the pages

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
I do stuff like surrealism, purism

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
I took some tracks that Dustin

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Marshall made and I remixed them

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
and made some music I also composed

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
a song for it as well

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
I did a dance

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
for it

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
I basically tried 50 to 60

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
different art styles that are out there cooking

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
you know things and I said you know

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
I can't be a comic book artist

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
what kind of artist can I be

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
and so this book was my

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
exploration of that so

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
through these digital memories you go

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
through the pages and you can press

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
the purism piece I did and it will tell

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
you the history of purism and then

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
you can manipulate things there's

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
voice acting on each page that you can

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
press and there's like you can hear the

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
characters talk and then there's

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
movies at play while you're watching it

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
the soundtrack plays while you're reading

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
it and I thought

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
well if I'm going to do something special

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
if these guys everyone sees something special

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
in this then I want to make it the most

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
unique project so I'm proud to say

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
that it's probably less than a month

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
from being completed finally

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
cool

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
and

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
when it comes out

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
I'm really looking forward

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
if you want to see a preview I put

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
30 pages on the subreddit

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
which is about a third of the book

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
oh jeez seek that's terrible marketing

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
that's what NBC

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
did with every scene of community

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
that I gave them

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
I do some

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
marketing for a comic book company

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
and I do some editing but

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
the truth is I'm not a business

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
person I'm not a sales person

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
I just know how to take pieces of

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
myself and share it with people

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Trump Trump Trump

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Trump

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
that sounds awesome

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
that's fantastic news

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
I mean where are you at

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
personally like what is your

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
so what that has done for me is

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
when I thought about

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
that I could check out any day

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
now I'm at the point where I'm like

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
you know what I have

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
goals and I don't want to check out anymore

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
I used to

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
just be ready to go at any moment

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
and now I'm

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
I never had a five year plan

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
I never gave love a chance

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
because I just was like well what's the point

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
if I'm just going to go now I'm like

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
no I'm here so let's

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
actually try to be

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
human and let's try to do some of this stuff

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
as flawed as I may be

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
and you were telling me backstage

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
that you started experimenting

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
with racism

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
and that that's really

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
yeah see

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
you applaud and then he turns out to be racist

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
I'm sorry New Zealand

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
I'm sorry

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
how amazing was that

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
I started my dreams

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
became my memories and then I remembered

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
oh my god I hate black people

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
actually I must hate white people

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
because of all the things I've written since soul star

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
everyone says where are your white characters

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
I go I think I hate them

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
yeah that's the only good

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
kind of white person you could be

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
that's the only choice I could make

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
I have to be racist

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
so I'm going to assume all white people are racist

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
that's my racism

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
is this called soul star

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
oh yeah that's on Amazon

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
it's a superhero book

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Elan Vitale is this book

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
okay I just wanted to make sure that got out there

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
oh thank you

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
yeah Elan Vitale is called

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
it's based on a French theory

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
philosopher that he thought

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
you could transfer the human soul into an inanimate object

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
so

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
the book's very meta

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
not only is the robot

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
does he have a soul transferred into him

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
but he actually has my soul

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
so in the book you're reading

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
he has my memories

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
so you actually see me go from the hospital

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
to where I am now

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
in the book through his memories

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
into this book

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
so why did he wipe out humanity if he got your soul

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
does he

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
there's an anger

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
we've established he's a racist

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
he's just racist

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
against humans

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
is it

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
yeah well what I've noticed is what you guys were talking about

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
earlier gun control like I'm on

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
obviously your side with it

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
I hate anything that takes human life

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
and I hate that

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
number one thing humans

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
and I hate that there's even a debate about it

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
to me it's

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
that's insanity and I know why

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
obviously I know money's involved in everything

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
people in power but so I thought

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
what would I do

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
how would I save the world

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
so Elan

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
he doesn't want to kill anyone

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
I would never want to kill anyone

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
so he releases an airborne virus that renders everyone sterile

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
and

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
so this

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
generation of humanity is the last generation

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
that's what I do

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
yeah

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
except now what you've done is

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
you've forced natural selection to leave

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
only people who can afford Teslas to breed

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
well actually

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I actually mentioned that in the book

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
he shuts down the power to all the Teslas

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
oh

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
smart

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
all those chambers that

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
seal you in he shuts them all down before he does it

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
yeah

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
clever robot

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
I like that idea making everyone

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
yeah I mean that would be nice

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
I

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
so hot

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
you know what would be sad

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
so hot

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
if you could render them not only sterile but also kind of sexless

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
so that they could

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
this would be tragic but also beautiful

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
that they could spend their last

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
generation of humanity could actually give you some hope

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
for humanity because everybody would be like well

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
I don't have like fucking

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
all these like because don't you think like hormones

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
are like

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
what he does is yeah I mean there is a

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
I don't want to spoil the ending

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
but there's I definitely touch on things like that

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
towards the end of the story

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
I'm just trying to make it because I just

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
around my 42nd birthday I was like

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
I don't really want to jerk off anymore

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
and then I see those commercials

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
where the guy catches a football and goes like hey

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
I'm coach Johnson

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
uh

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
my dick stopped working but

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
my pharmacist said I could get

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
a dickula

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
now and then he throws the football

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
really hard and you watch it

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
go into it like a pussy

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
I'm like why would they put a pussy

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
and use a football

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
it's not even clever and he's like

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
get your football back in a pussy

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
with dickula

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
like dickula that doesn't sound like a pill

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
sounds like Dracula

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
it does

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
coach Johnson

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
it's a terrible commercial but

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
I'm like I don't want

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
I saw the commercial and I'm like yeah but

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
these are the best days of my life

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
I'm like friends with women

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
these are the salad days

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
I feel like I'm a better person

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
since I became more like a fucking

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
yeah I don't call you anymore

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
because you know why

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
because you dick doesn't work

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
what the fuck are you

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
what are you saying

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
yeah

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
yeah

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
my dick doesn't work

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
it turned Schrab's text

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
but he invites me over

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
what the fuck

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
I don't want you to come over now

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
weird

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
seriously since I

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
I'm 43 now and I've spent the last year

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
trying to throw a football at a tire swing

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
and I cannot do it

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
and it's because

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
I

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
would rather be having sex

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
yeah

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
well good for you

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
must be nice

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
I like Minecraft

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
oh I play Minecraft too

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
and you still fuck women

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
god damn it

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
well then life just isn't fair

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
it's not

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
you get to be at the same age

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
when I was a kid

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
you were the kid on Star Trek

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
now we're both the same age

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
and you're the guy

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
who plays games for a living

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
and fucks while he's playing Minecraft

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
not while I'm playing Minecraft

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
I really need to be focused

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I got a whole set of diamond armor

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
that I don't want to lose

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
because I got fucking knocked to me

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
I've worked a long time

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
on my crafting table

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
if you catch my drift

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
and the Minecraft's important too

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
yeah

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
she's good

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
alright

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
well let's

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
let's give Seeker our two handed

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
hug

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
we

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
we went till 10 o'clock

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
I think it's a great show

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
I already know you don't care

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
you played a great game

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
of non-fantasy role-playing games

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
earlier

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
yeah I kind of made you

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
absolute with my werewolf

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
yeah and then Will Wheaton made me dead

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
it was all part of the long game

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
it was a good move

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
that's what always happens

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
is I always am too smart and get killed right off the bat

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
but that means

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
we have to substitute the game of Shadowrun

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
which is usually just a rip-ro-ring

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
show-closer

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
and the only other thing I can think of

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
is a wrap

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
right Dustin?

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
alright here we go

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
he just needs a minute

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
give him a minute

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
give him a minute

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
I got a beat

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Batman's got a beat

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
I don't want anybody's sloppy-ass beatboxing

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
I'm gonna wrap clean tonight

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
wrap clean

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
wrap it clean

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
clean tempo

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
oh my god and beatboxing beat

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
it's like too sloppy

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
let's do it right

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
let's do it nice decent

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
decent for once

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
let's have a decent wrap

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
with some good rhymes

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
and a whack-ass beat

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
come on

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
look for

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
god damn it

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
the particulate

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
the reticulate

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
counterpart

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
with JK Simmons

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
who I've known since Law & Order

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
and posers like you

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
just remember from

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
when he was naked on the Oz

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
look for that, that sounds awesome

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
it'll be out at some point next year

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
it's gonna be a well

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
and Will just wants you to

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
man, he guns you cock-suckers

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
that's pretty much sums up

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
my whole position on life

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
do you want to plug in anything?

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
nah, I'm on hiatus

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
I'm just being a writer right now

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
tabletop is surprisingly addictive

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
oh thanks man

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
big surprise

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
what do you mean surprisingly?

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
because on paper

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
there's no shame in saying that on paper

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
it sounds like a crazy idea

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
to watch people play a tabletop again

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
I like the idea

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
god damn it

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
that's

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
I was so excited

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
about it and so passionate about it

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
and I never felt any pressure

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
because I don't have to

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
make a network happy

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
so I just had to make a thing that made me happy

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
and I felt like look if the audience comes along

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
great and if the audience doesn't come along

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
well I really had a good time making this

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
that's what I care about

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
so it never occurred to me

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
that if this doesn't work

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
that wasn't the goal

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
that's what's so great about it

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
of course you wouldn't be thinking that

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
and apologizing for it in your head

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
that's what's neat though

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
there are people who understand that shit

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
and there are people

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
who don't

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
yo

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
like the fire up

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
yo

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
like the fire up

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
yo

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
like sit in the fire

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
and settle my fire

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
gonna sit around the fire

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
until we get tired

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
on a camping trip

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
roasting marshmallows

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
gonna fuck your mama

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
every way with the fellas

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
gonna

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
I'm sorry that sounds rapey

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
just start over

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
yo

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
let's just go camping

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
and then maybe we'll start vamping

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
some people call me eccentric

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
my name is eccentric

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
2B4

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
I'm a new kind of rapper with my dicks through the floor

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
I like to crouch down

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
and put it between the boards

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
and I fuck it so low

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
I found some gourds

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
I lift them out and I look at the seeds

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
and I throw them in the garden

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
cause that's what my family needs

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
need some food that is organic

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
I wanna fucking eat it

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
cause I don't wanna panic

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
environments and climate change

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
I fuck your mama in the city

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
fuck your mama on the range

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
