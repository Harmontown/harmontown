Oh, shit! Oh, shit!\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:15.000\nFucking shit! Shit! Fucking shit, man! Oh, shit!\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:22.000\nOh, my ass!\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:29.000\nNo, no. I'm very excited to be here tonight, Dan, Daniel.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:39.000\nI don't know if I've mentioned this to you in the past 25 years, but your sincerity sounds sarcastic.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:42.000\nThat's my Midwest accent.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:56.000\nLet's bring Game Master Spencer Crittenden out. Game Master!\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:06.000\nOh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Shit! Shit!\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:15.000\nFucking shit!\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:24.000\nAll right. It was great. Thank you. It was good. It was pretty good.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:31.000\nIt was great. It was freezing. I was walking home from the bar tonight, and it was freezing.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:34.000\nIt was freezing outside. It was cold out. You were wearing a shirt.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:39.000\nSo nice. I went into the Froyo. You went into the Froyo?\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:43.000\nIt's warmer in the Froyo. That's how cold it is.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:50.000\nWell, I got to get out of this Arctic chill. I better go to the frozen yogurt area.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:57.000\nNo, because the Froyo was not packed. It was deserted. That's how cold it was.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:06.000\nIt was deserted. Look at this guy. Oh, shit! Oh, shit!\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:12.000\nWe're like the lions in front of the Chicago Museum of Natural History.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:17.000\nOh, shit! That's what they're saying, right?\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:23.000\nYou want a book? Shit! Oh, shit!\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:26.000\nSo Halloween's upon us. You must be excited. You're one of those people.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:30.000\nI'm one of those people that is excited. What does that mean?\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:34.000\nWell, you like to put effort into the Halloween. I like putting effort into the Halloween.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:36.000\nYou make the costumes there. I make the costumes.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:49.000\nYou're like one of those Adam Savage art school, I don't know, dyslexic people.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:54.000\nThis is true. It's a big day of the year for you.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:59.000\nYou like to go like, oh, look at me. I'm a big robot.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:03.000\nDan, what are you going to go for Halloween? Are you going to dress up this year?\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:09.000\nI am proud to say that it's a decision I have never made until three hours before any party I go to on Halloween.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:13.000\nAnd I have always done it with items in and around my neighborhood.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:19.000\nWhat is your favorite Halloween costume that you've ever done since knowing me?\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:24.000\nWell, I'm not counting the ones that you made for me. You made me a ghostbuster.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:25.000\nYes, I did.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:28.000\nI was a ghostbuster. That was my best Halloween costume that I ever had.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:30.000\nI didn't make that costume.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:31.000\nThat's true. I made it.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:35.000\nYou made me a proton pack out of household objects. It looked like a proton pack.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:36.000\nIt looked like one.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:37.000\nIt was great.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:38.000\nIt was good.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:39.000\nGreat.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:41.000\nSo here's the thing. So you know these people...\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nThat was the best one.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:50.000\nYeah, it was. My favorite one is when I found that computer monitor on the street, the day of Halloween.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:54.000\nI took it home. I took all the stuff out. I put the monitor on my head.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nI glued Viking horns to it from a helmet.\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:05.000\nI put on a fur diaper and a tail, and I was a monitor.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:09.000\nAnd it was comfortable. I could sit.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:14.000\nAnd all the fratty guys at the park, because I was going out.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:18.000\nThat was the only time in my life that fratty guys liked me.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:24.000\nI won a costume contest, because I kind of had like a Belushi-ish kind of hairy appeal.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nLet me just explain.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:31.000\nYou only had the furry diaper and monitor. You were shirtless.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:32.000\nYeah.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:33.000\nYeah.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:34.000\nYeah.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:38.000\nI had a little fur cape because of my shoulder acne.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nI remember that. Yes.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:41.000\nOkay.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:42.000\nSo...\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:43.000\nThat was a good one.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:46.000\nSo Halloween... So Dino and I were just talking about this.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:51.000\nSo you know those people... So when they meet you...\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:55.000\nSome of you are listening that are these people.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:58.000\nI've never been so certain about something.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nI'm not a guy who proclaims things.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:05.000\nYou know me. This show is about me being old and going like, I don't know what to make of this.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:06.000\nWhat do you kids think?\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nYou're like, you're racist.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nAnd I go, you're right.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.000\nDad's racist.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:14.000\nYou know what? What is race?\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nAnd they're like, you're right. Stop talking about it so much.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nI'm like, I talk about it too much. You kids are right.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:24.000\nBut here's something I'm absolutely certain of that I don't care.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nI don't care if I'm the one person on Earth saying this.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:32.000\nIf you're one of those people who when you meet somebody, if you ever hear yourself saying the words,\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:35.000\nyou don't remember my name, do you?\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nYeah.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:40.000\nI'm not going to say you're a terrible piece of shit.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:43.000\nBecause you might be doing it because you learned...\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nYou know how dogs learn to lift their leg from other dogs?\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\nSome dogs spend their whole life going like that.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:51.000\nLike Harvey. And then Nigel's just like, fuck it.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nAnd then after a while, I guess they actually learned...\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:54.000\nThat's not important.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:58.000\nBut you might have learned that behavior.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nYou might have learned that by being rewarded for it.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:01.000\nThat's why I'm telling you.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:06.000\nIf you're doing that, you are doing a bad thing to another person.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:07.000\nWhy is it bad?\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:10.000\nI know why it's bad, but I want education to happen.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.000\nOkay, so let's break it down.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:16.000\nOkay, do you want to VR this? Should we VR it?\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nWait, VR it?\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nWhat, very...\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nVirtual reality.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:28.000\nVeronica Robbins.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:31.000\nI don't... Why would VR? We are VR.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:32.000\nIt's a show.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:33.000\nOkay, great.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nOkay, we're at a party.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:36.000\nOh, okay.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nThat's role-playing.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nTomato, tomato, all right.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nOkay, here we go.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nOkay, all right. I'm at a party.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nHello.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nHello.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nOh, hey, hey.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nHey.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:01.000\nHey.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:04.000\nHi, Dan.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nHow's it going?\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nIt's going pretty good.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nYou don't remember me, do you?\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nThis party's amazing.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:19.000\nKevin, who invited me to the party, and whose name I know,\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\ndid a great job hanging all these streamers,\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nI work with him.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:26.000\nHe's my special effects engineer.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nI had conversations with him about his children.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:34.000\nKevin, his party, Dan, no.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:38.000\nFreeze it.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:39.000\nWhat happened?\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:40.000\nLet's...\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:41.000\nHitchhiker's guide.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:42.000\nWhat happened?\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:47.000\nWhat happened there?\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:48.000\nI know what happened.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nYou know what happened.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nThey need to know what happened.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:53.000\nWhat happened is that my...\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nWell, okay, so here's the thing, but I've been...\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nIt's a bait and switch.\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:59.000\nWhat?\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:00.000\nWhat?\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.000\nIt's a...\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.000\nBecause it always starts with this face.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nYeah.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:08.000\nWhy is that a bait and switch?\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:09.000\nIt seems like a bait and bait.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:10.000\nWell, I don't know.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:11.000\nMaybe I'm using bait and switch, Ron.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nBut it's...\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nEntrapment is what it is.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nBut is it even that?\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nIt's just somebody coming up, I mean,\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nit's like if a cop just came up and said,\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nyou're doing drugs, you're doing drugs, you're doing drugs,\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:23.000\nyou're doing drugs, it's not entrapment.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nI think it's somebody who comes up to,\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nknows that you're not going to remember their name\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nand goes, hello, Dan.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:32.000\nMakes it a point to say your name.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:33.000\nRight?\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:34.000\nWell, let's get...\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nI'm going to go one orbit beyond that.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nBecause what I want to say is like,\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nlet's really break this down.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:42.000\nSo let's say someone doesn't remember your name.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:46.000\nSo how is that on them?\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:49.000\nIf you're a human being and you acknowledge that\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:53.000\nmemory of your name is somehow currency,\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nthen aren't you the poor one?\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nYeah, it's your fault.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nYou didn't make an impression.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:01.000\nRight.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nAnd it's not...\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:03.000\nThat would be the way...\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:04.000\nThat's the way to flip it,\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nbecause those people push your shame button\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nand you go, oh, I should remember your name.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nSo then you want to flip it 180 degrees ago.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nNo, you're a piece of shit and you're unmemorable.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:16.000\nBut like, somewhere in the middle there is just fucking reality.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:17.000\nYeah.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nLike, who cares?\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nMaybe I have a fucking illness.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:22.000\nMaybe I...\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:23.000\nMaybe you...\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:26.000\nMaybe you meet more people than the person who's complaining.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nMaybe you look like my uncle.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:33.000\nMaybe my eye has a fucking like baby's finger in it.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nLike maybe I'm in a Japanese horror movie\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nwhere I got baby fingers in my eye.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:38.000\nBaby fingers in the eye.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:41.000\nMaybe an asteroid passed through the fucking Earth's orbit\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:44.000\nand like made a gas that only I'm allergic to\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nand that only I can sense.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:47.000\nIt made me forget.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:48.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:49.000\nWhy does that matter?\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:50.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nWhen people drop their wallet on the floor,\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:57.000\nwhich is as much like an accident as them not knowing your name,\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nnobody ever goes like...\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:00.000\nUm...\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:01.000\nUh...\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:02.000\nUh...\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:03.000\nUh...\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:04.000\nUh...\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:05.000\nUh...\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:06.000\nUh...\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:07.000\nUh...\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:08.000\nUh...\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:09.000\nUh...\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:10.000\nUh...\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.000\nUh...\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:12.000\nUh...\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.000\nUh...\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:14.000\nUh...\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:15.000\nUh...\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nUh...\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nSave that jungle, man.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:19.000\nSave the jungle.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nFrom the great white hunter of you having dropped your wallet.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:22.000\nAren't you thankful you met me?\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nYou're all stoked when someone drops their wallet.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:25.000\nYes.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nWhen they forget your name, you're like...\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:27.000\nOw!\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nSomeone pooped their pants.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:32.000\nBut you know that you don't really think that.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:33.000\nYou know what you're thinking is,\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:38.000\nuh-oh, I pooped the pants of memorability.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:39.000\nAnd it's like...\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:40.000\nAnd here's the thing.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nSo this is why I've turned around on tattoos\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.000\nand piercings and all that stuff.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:45.000\nBecause I'm not saying like,\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:46.000\noh thank you and you're doing that for me,\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:47.000\nso I remember who you are.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nYour steel face or like, you know,\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nspider neck or whatever.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nBut these are people who...\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nOkay, so I used to think, I was like,\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\noh man, I don't trust you if you have tattoos.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nThis is me 20 years ago.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nEverybody in the audience has fucking tattoos now.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:02.000\nAnd I love you all.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:03.000\nBut I used to be like,\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:06.000\nwhen they first started becoming like a thing,\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:07.000\nand I was always like,\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nman, somebody's got like a tattoo\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nor like a thing through their face.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:14.000\nAnd all I see is like somebody that's like,\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:17.000\nthinking like, oh, I don't know who I am.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:18.000\nThey don't know who you are.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:19.000\nAnd I'm like, I'm gonna move to California.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.000\nThat's who I am.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nI'm gonna make everybody know who I am.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nEverybody will know who I am\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:24.000\nwhen I move to California.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.000\nBut now, in this apoc...\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nYou're being sarcastic the whole night.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nNo, I'm not.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nNo, no.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nThis is like...\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nEd McMahon did this to Johnny.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:35.000\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:36.000\nYou never knew.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:37.000\nHe could never nail him down.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:38.000\nHe was just always over there going,\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\noh yeah.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:41.000\nWhat a great job.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nEverybody.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:43.000\nI'm supporting.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nAnd Johnny would go home and he'd go,\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:48.000\nI know that fucking asshole is fucking...\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:49.000\nI'm gonna catch him.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:50.000\nI'm gonna catch him.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:51.000\nI'm on your side.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:52.000\nI'm on your side.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:53.000\nSo at least if you...\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nWe all wake up with that feeling.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nOh boy, I hope people remember me.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:58.000\nOh, I just met...\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:00.000\nI just ran into the sixth person this week\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:03.000\nwho it became clear like they had me confused\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\nwith someone else.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nLike, I now told...\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:09.000\nLike the person who takes that onto themself,\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:12.000\nI'm not saying it makes them a better or worse person,\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:13.000\nbut like, at least they're...\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:14.000\nWell, I am saying it makes them a better person\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.000\nbecause they're pretending their own garden.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nLike I'm not saying they should do what they do\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nand people are gonna be offended because they're gonna go,\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:21.000\nI have a tattoo and guess what?\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:22.000\nIt's an expression of this.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nYou're saying that it's because I'm an incomplete person.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:25.000\nI'm not saying that.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:26.000\nI'm just saying like,\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:29.000\nnow when I see somebody who has something weird about them,\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:32.000\nlike a funny hat but at an angle\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:35.000\nor like a bird on their shoulder.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.000\nLike one boot's big and the other one's like really small.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:39.000\nThe small boot.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:40.000\nOr your name.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:42.000\nYour name is like Trisha,\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nbut it's spelled with nine i's.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:45.000\nYeah.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:49.000\nAnd one of them's an e, but it's called an i.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:55.000\nNow I'm like, oh, this is a person who is kind of saying like...\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nI'm meaning you halfway.\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:02.000\nThey're saying like, I'm making this my problem, not yours.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:03.000\nI don't know if it's true.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:04.000\nI don't know if it's not true,\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:07.000\nbut I'm doing something about it by myself.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nI'm going down to the corner.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nI'm going to say stick a needle in my face\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nand draw a scorpion on it\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nand like fucking like take some shit,\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nput it up my butt and give me a tail.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nYou're asking people to do that too?\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:19.000\nNo.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nYou just said I'm...\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:24.000\nOkay, I lost you with the needle in the butt.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:28.000\nBut I also started paying attention.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:32.000\nBut the people who go like, you don't know my name, do you?\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nSo just don't do that because you might have...\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:35.000\nDon't do it.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nIt's like a social thing where you're like,\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.000\noh, I have leverage now.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nYou don't have leverage.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:40.000\nThey're going to...\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:43.000\nEveryone that you hope that would affect in your favor,\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:47.000\nlike that's exactly the person that's going to bum out the most.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.000\nLike the thing that it's like...\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nAlways just always...\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:52.000\nI always do this.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nLike I just go like...\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nJust be the person that says,\n\n14:56.000 --> 15:00.000\nif there's even 10% of a reason to be unsure,\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\njust say, oh, Matt Dawson,\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:06.000\njust in case you don't remember or something like that.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:07.000\nThat's what I do.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:08.000\nI always say, you know,\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:11.000\nhey, I don't know if you remember,\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:14.000\nor even I don't know if you remember is kind of like sets them up.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nBut we'll figure it out.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:19.000\nBut I do it from a point of,\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nI don't expect you to remember,\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nmaybe because you probably have a busy day.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:24.000\nYou have children.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nYou have a car.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:30.000\nYou have shows that you watch with other names of characters\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:31.000\nand stuff like that.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nThat's a lot to process.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nSo I'm saying, hey, hey, how you doing?\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.000\nOh, you remembered me.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nOh, bonus for me that you remembered me.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:39.000\nOh.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:44.000\nSo make that noise more often.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nSo here's the funny thing.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nThis Halloween, now watch for this.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nSo this is why I brought this all up.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:50.000\nBecause Dino and I were talking about this.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:51.000\nWe're talking about that topic.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:53.000\nAnd then we started talking about Halloween costumes.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nAnd we started talking about the people who do like the puns.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:59.000\nLike the one that I really remember very clearly\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nwas somebody in Milwaukee that was like,\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nhe was like pitching somebody their Halloween costume\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:04.000\nin front of me.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nAnd I was just like sitting there at the bar.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nAnd he's like, this is what I'm going to do.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:11.000\nPaint myself blue, head to toe,\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:14.000\nand look with a frame, like an empty frame.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nI'm going to carry it around.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:19.000\nAnd I'm making you guess.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nGay or New England?\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:25.000\nI just noticed.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nBecause I'm trying to do an actual impression of this guy.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:30.000\nAnd I'm like, wait, is he gay or is he from New England?\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:33.000\nI was like, I'm going to have a painting frame.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:37.000\nAnd then tampons on strings just all around.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:38.000\nAnd then he waits.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nHe waits for the five second pause, which is what people do.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nAnd they just, when they pitch you,\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:43.000\ntheir fucking pun Halloween costumes.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:46.000\nAnd then he goes, Picasso's blue period.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:49.000\nAnd the, yeah.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nBecause what, and where in the world,\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nwhat dimension is anyone going to go like,\n\n16:53.000 --> 17:03.000\noh, God, I knew the words blue and period would be involved.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:08.000\nBecause you painted yourself blue.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:12.000\nAnd then tampons are for periods.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:16.000\nDid that person ever follow through and make that costume?\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:19.000\nI bet he didn't because he talked it out.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nYou don't see Woody Allen being like,\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nwhat if I did a drama?\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nHe's like, tippy-tap, tap, tap.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nHe doesn't give a shit if the movie's good or bad.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nHe's like, now he's getting 90 movies.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nSo of course he has five great ones.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nObviously I have access to grind hair.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:35.000\nOoh, here we go.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:41.000\nShots fired.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nSo, okay.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nSo just give me a second.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nJust let me say so for a second.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.000\nJust give me a second.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nJust give me a second.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:53.000\nSo this Halloween, so here's the thing.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nSo you're going to be walking around\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:56.000\nand there's going to be, of course,\n\n17:56.000 --> 18:00.000\nthere's the usual amount of now aging kitty cats.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:03.000\nI think that's like a baby boomer thing right now.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:04.000\nKitty cats.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nYeah, kitty cats, a sexy kitty cat.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:07.000\nOh, okay.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:08.000\nRight.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:11.000\nAnd then there's that whole thing.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:16.000\nAnd then there's a lot of puns, a lot of pun people.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:19.000\nSo pay attention to this, these pun people,\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:20.000\nthese pun costume people.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:23.000\nBecause Dino was telling the story about how a guy came up\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:27.000\nand he was wearing blue from the neck down\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:31.000\nand then he had like a white cotton thing on top.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:34.000\nAnd this is the thing that happens at Halloween parties.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:37.000\nAnd he goes like, what do you think?\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:43.000\nAnd Dino's like, oh, very scary.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:47.000\nAnd the guy goes, I'm a Q-tip.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:50.000\nAnd Dino's like, why aren't your shoes furry?\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nAnd why am I having this conversation\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:55.000\nand why is this not Riddle Day?\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:58.000\nAnd if it was, you're cheating like Bilbo Bag and saying,\n\n18:58.000 --> 18:59.000\nwhat's in my pocket?\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:03.000\nLike you're not doing a good, your fantasy is to be a Q-tip\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nand to have people go, ah, it's Q-tip.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:09.000\nOr is it, and underneath that Q-tip costume,\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:12.000\nisn't there a guy who on Monday morning\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nat the water cooler is going to be saying,\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nyou don't know my name, do you?\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:17.000\nNo.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:20.000\nIt's the same fucking guy.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nYou just watch them.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nAnd they're reptile people.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nThey go to Halloween and they go like,\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nthey purposely make the shitty pun costume\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nand then they walk around and go,\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:33.000\nbecause they can't take one day off\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:36.000\nof being, of everyone else's fault,\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:40.000\nof it being everyone else's fault that they're not memorable.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nHalloween should be their fucking leg.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nThat should be their Achilles heel, baby,\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nbecause they get to be whoever they want.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:49.000\nAnd then it's their fault if you don't know them.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nBecause if they were, if they're Fred Flintstone\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nand you don't know, it's their fault.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:54.000\nThey're hoping.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nAnd I'm telling you, it's just as much their fault\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nthat you don't know they're Bob Johnson.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\n364 days a year.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:03.000\nSo they fucking check it out.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:06.000\nAnd they go like, they make the Fred Flintstone shirt\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nlike kind of purple.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nAnd they put the tire on their shoulder\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nso that they're like, I'm Fred Flintstone\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nafter the OJ trials or something.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:17.000\nAnd it's like, you always think like,\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\noh, the joke didn't land.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nNo, reptile person.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:24.000\nLike, can't fuck a cold-blooded animal.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:25.000\nCan't fucking do it.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nIf you have to go, guess what I am,\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:30.000\nyou did it wrong.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nHey, yeah, you know, if you got to go,\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:35.000\nask me what I'm, what I am,\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nyou did it wrong.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:39.000\nOh, not just kind of wrong.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:42.000\nI mean, if you're...\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:45.000\nIf your idea of a seven-course meal\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:48.000\nis a six-pack and a hot dog,\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:51.000\nyou might have a Halloween costume.\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:00.000\nHere comes the phone.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:03.000\nHello, driver's license?\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nYeah, and I don't know if you people\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nare familiar with this problem,\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:13.000\nbut I haven't done my left hand on my phone yet.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:14.000\nOh, man.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nSo I have to, it's just, it's a nightmare.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:17.000\nYou got to bite that bullet.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:18.000\nI haven't scanned my left thumb yet.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:20.000\nYou got to scan it, man.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:23.000\nI know.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nIt takes like two minutes.\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:28.000\nThe worst.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:31.000\nMy hands are too sweaty for those things.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:32.000\nThey don't read it.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:35.000\nI swear, if these people knew how we really lived,\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:38.000\nit must be nice for them.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:44.000\nMy thumbs are greasy from all those chips that I eat.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\nI eat a lot of chips.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nAll right, I don't have anything else to say.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nChips are delicious.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:53.000\nI have some chips before I came here.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:56.000\nAll right, hey, so I think we'll do things in...\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:59.000\nHashtag Chips.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:06.000\nWhy would you hashtag chips?\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.000\nOh, you have a gift for you?\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:09.000\nOh, you have a gift?\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nYeah.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:11.000\nOkay.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:12.000\nDid you, is this a plant?\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nWhat happened?\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:14.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:15.000\nDoes this happen every show?\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:16.000\nI should know about this stuff.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:17.000\nI'm controlling.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nNo, this is a world tour.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:20.000\nThis is hot sauce.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:21.000\nPeople will fuck you up, man.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:22.000\nOh, no.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nYou should stick it up your butt.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:26.000\nYou should definitely stick it up your butt.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:28.000\nIf you don't, you're using it wrong.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:31.000\nNo, I also gave you some toothpicks.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:33.000\nSo the whole point of the hot sauce...\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:35.000\nIt's got to be thick, then.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:40.000\nI can also come up and show you if you buy it.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nAll right, well, yeah, I mean, it would be weird\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nto not bring you up now.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:52.000\nThis is the hottest hot sauce in the world.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nWhat voice is coming out of the darkness?\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:55.000\nSit in this chair if you can.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nOh, damn, excuse me here.\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:00.000\nThere's a lot of hot sauce in the world with some toothpicks.\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:05.000\nThis is encouraging behavior that is going to snowball\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:06.000\nfor the rest of the show.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nYeah, if we're not careful, this show could lose it.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nI've got the most poisonous poison in the world.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nHere we go.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nNo, honestly, like...\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nWhat's next, beef jerky?\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:18.000\nThis honestly shows how easy it would be to poison people.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nYeah, I mean, yeah.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nYeah, look at it.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\nIt looks like blood.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:24.000\nWhat's your name, young man?\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:25.000\nMy name is Garrett Harvey.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:27.000\nAnd are you 12 years old?\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:29.000\nWell, he didn't say...\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nYou know, I wish.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nThe important thing is he'll...\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nWhen I asked him his name, he didn't say\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:38.000\nGarrett Jason Harvey or Garrett Lee Harvey.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:41.000\nHe's only got two names, so this should be safe.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:43.000\nWell...\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:47.000\nThat age joke was a diss on us, not you.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:48.000\nYou know that, right?\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:49.000\nNo, no, no, it's fine.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:50.000\nSo...\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nHe's probably so young.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:53.000\nHe probably goes home and goes,\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nsomeone called me 11 again.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nAnd he's back in Goldblum.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:58.000\nMom!\n\n23:58.000 --> 23:59.000\nDoes this look 11?\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:02.000\nDoes this look 11?\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:07.000\nSo, pretty much...\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nAnd the two picks are what for?\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:10.000\nThey're for eating the hot sauce,\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:11.000\nwhich I wouldn't recommend.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:12.000\nOh, really?\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:13.000\nWell, no, no, no.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:16.000\nWho just eats fucking hot sauce on a toothpick?\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:17.000\nWhat?\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:18.000\nWhat it is, is a...\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:21.000\nYou gotta put that shit on some chia...\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:24.000\nYou gotta get the chips out.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nWhere are the chips?\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:29.000\nGet some chips on here.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nGet some chips.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:34.000\nYou put the hot sauce on a toothpick.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:35.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:39.000\nWhat the fuck are you putting the hot sauce on a toothpick?\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:40.000\nWho's got some chips?\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:41.000\nSomeone's got chips?\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:42.000\nI think you should try it.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:45.000\nHis reaction would actually be pretty fucking awesome.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:46.000\nWell, I don't...\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:47.000\nThe thing that's confusing to me about this,\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:48.000\nand I don't want to be like a negative,\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:51.000\na negative Nelly or Slur thing, but it just seems like...\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:52.000\nWell, of course...\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:53.000\nYou could bring battery acid up here,\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:54.000\nand I was like...\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:55.000\nOh, that's very hot.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:56.000\nAnd then you're talking to me like,\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:57.000\noh, that hurts.\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:00.000\nI'm not like an adrenaline junkie or a...\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:01.000\nI don't...\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nThat's not gonna get me drunk or...\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nIf you have enough of it, maybe.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:06.000\nBut it doesn't...\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:07.000\nI mean, it's not...\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nIt's not like jackass or anything.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:10.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:13.000\nBut it might make the show.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:14.000\nIt might make the show.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:17.000\nWell, I mean, insult taken, but...\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:25.000\nI hope to God, we don't get to that point, but...\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nIf there's chips, if there's chips...\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:28.000\nWe got some chips!\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:29.000\nWe got some chips!\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nOkay.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nWe got chips!\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nOkay, we got some chips.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nDan, we got chips.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:36.000\nI'll have some.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:37.000\nDan will have some.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:38.000\nOkay.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nWell, why don't you...\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\nWe can't show the label.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.000\nI'll do it with all of you.\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:44.000\nYou're gonna do it, too.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:45.000\nWhy doesn't just he do it,\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:48.000\nin case, you know, we have to do a show after this.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:49.000\nRight.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:53.000\nNow, these are potato chips.\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:56.000\nThey're not standard regulation chips.\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nLike, the possibility that this is great,\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:03.000\nlet's say it's one in four, but...\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:04.000\nOut of a thousand.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\nThe possibility of it going wrong,\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:10.000\nthe consequences of that are much, much more dire\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:11.000\nthan I think any possible...\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:12.000\nRight.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:13.000\nI would say...\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:14.000\nIs it just physical pain?\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:16.000\nYeah, no, it just hurts, and there's no milk,\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nso you'll drink water or something,\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nand then it'll hurt more, and it'll get worse.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.000\nYeah.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:22.000\nRight.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.000\nWell, I'm as wide open, same as you,\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:27.000\nbut it's weird to just say no.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:28.000\nHey, man.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nI'm too trained for the theater.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:31.000\nI'm not gonna do it.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.000\nI already said yes!\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:34.000\nWe got the chips!\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:36.000\nI'm too shaped for the show, man!\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:39.000\nGot the hashtag chips right there in the cup!\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:40.000\nCome on!\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nYeah, just...\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:43.000\nMake it alive.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:46.000\nSo, you want to do the chips and not the toothpick,\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nbecause I'm offering you to just dip the tip of the toothpick\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:49.000\nand just put it in your mouth.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:50.000\nWhy would you...\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:51.000\nSee, if he's...\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:52.000\nI'm offering you an easy way out.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.000\nHow do you eat it?\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:54.000\nHow do you eat it?\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:55.000\nDip the toothpick.\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:56.000\nOkay, see...\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:57.000\nFor fun?\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:58.000\nIt doesn't make any sense.\n\n26:58.000 --> 26:59.000\nYou're an insane person, then.\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:01.000\nLike, why are you...\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:02.000\nYou're like a cone head.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:03.000\nYou're like Mark from Orc.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:04.000\nWhat the hell?\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:05.000\nAre you...\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:07.000\nPut it on some chips!\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:08.000\nOkay!\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:09.000\nBut...\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nWhy do you put hot sauce on a toothpick?\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nBut it's not food, Rob.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:14.000\nIt's not even a kind of...\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:18.000\nHe's going to hurt us really bad to the point where he doesn't even eat it on a chip.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:19.000\nI'll do it.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:20.000\nYou'll eat it on a chip.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:21.000\nLet's see that.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:22.000\nOkay, but we got to do it all at the same time.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nThis is the worst...\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:27.000\nI hope you're proud of yourself, young man.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nLike, I mean...\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:32.000\nI'm doing this specifically because my sister listens to the podcast\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:34.000\nand she told me not to embarrass her.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:35.000\nWhat?\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:36.000\nYeah.\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:37.000\nOw!\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:38.000\nOw!\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:41.000\nWho makes the hottest hot sauce ever?\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:44.000\nIt's called Satan's Blood, so probably Satan.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:46.000\nAsk a stupid question.\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:48.000\nNo, I don't...\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:49.000\nLet's just...\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:51.000\nIt's called Satan's Blood.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:52.000\nWhat do you do?\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:57.000\nYou just hang out and you just dip toothpicks in Satan's Blood.\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:58.000\nI mean, don't pour it on.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\nWipe the toothpick on it.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:01.000\nI mean, you...\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:02.000\nThe joke is up.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:05.000\nYou might as well come up here with a stapler and go put this through your nuts\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nand we're like, why would I do that?\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:09.000\nAnd then it's like, okay, here we go.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:11.000\nHere, you freaking amount.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:12.000\nI mean...\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nI don't want that chip.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.000\nGive that chip to Spencer.\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nI'm not touching none of that.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nAll right, so, I mean...\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:21.000\nDon't wait.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:24.000\nI just don't know how it'll work on the chip.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nWhat, are you a foodie now?\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:29.000\nI don't know!\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:32.000\nYou should really have white wine and fish with this.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nRight, right, right.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.000\nIt's just acid.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:37.000\nIt's just a hurtful acid.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:38.000\nLook at him shake.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:39.000\nThis is some hot sauce.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nWell, because he's like, gee, I hope I'm not...\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nWhat if I kill both of them?\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:44.000\nI hope I didn't...\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:47.000\nYeah, we're gonna like shit our pants and die.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:50.000\nYes.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nI mean, it's just...\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:56.000\nSo, again, I mean, I wouldn't recommend this at all.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:57.000\nLike, it's not a joke.\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:58.000\nYeah, you're right.\n\n28:58.000 --> 28:59.000\nWe shouldn't do it right now.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nWhy don't we just didn't do it right now?\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:05.000\nJust think about the hottest hot sauce you've ever had.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.000\nMy tongue will swell.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nThis is a lot hotter than any of that.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.000\nMy tongue will swell?\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:10.000\nIt could...\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nAny number of terrible things may happen.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:16.000\nBut all that could happen, and that's good, is maybe it'll be kind of entertaining for\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nfive minutes or so.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nI just don't think the math works out.\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nOkay, I totally agree with you.\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:23.000\nWait!\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nAbsolutely 100% agree with you, but there's no choice.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nIt's like, can you go going up to the...\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nYou're saying no?\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:32.000\nI'd be a hero if I didn't do it.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:35.000\nAll right, go ahead. They're saying no.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:36.000\nThey're saying no.\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nNo, they would be disappointed in me for doing that.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.000\nWait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.000\nSo, just walk me through this.\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:50.000\nLike, it's a Friday afternoon, and you're like, hey, man, let's skip class and stick...\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:51.000\nTwo picks in the hot...\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:55.000\nIt's Satan's blood, and just like, have a good time, man.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:56.000\nI honestly...\n\n29:56.000 --> 30:00.000\nIt's for a laugh factor, so you just give it to people who've never had it before.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nJust be like, hey, this is what you expect from the group.\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:03.000\nAll right.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:04.000\nWe're going to fuck with you.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nAll right, let's all have a hand for...\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nI'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nIt's like a hand buzzer in your mouth.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:11.000\nI'm not gonna...\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:12.000\nIt's not even temporary.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nLike, Spencer, he's saying your tongue could swell up.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:15.000\nIt could.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:16.000\nThey said don't do it.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nOkay, I'm gonna hold onto it.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:20.000\nIf the show starts dying, I'm gonna eat it.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:21.000\nOkay.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:22.000\nYeah, mine's right here.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nOkay, if it comes down to that, then we'll do it.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:25.000\nSounds good.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nThe rest of this is for you.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nOkay, thank you.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nTerrific.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:33.000\nNow, we fuck off, ladies.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:34.000\nWe'll do that.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:35.000\nWe got a lot of guests tonight.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:36.000\nThat's the thing.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:39.000\nSome of them are aneurysm survivors, not to make you feel too guilty.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:42.000\nKind of a letdown.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nDo with that information what you will.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:45.000\nWell, Schrab could do it.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.000\nThat's fine if Schrab doesn't.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:47.000\nI'm gonna wait.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:50.000\nYou're saying it was a letdown and I didn't eat the chipper.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nThere's a letdown that he...\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:53.000\nI'm so happy.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nThat his food turned out to be a practical joke.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nWhat are you saying?\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:58.000\nYes.\n\n30:58.000 --> 30:59.000\nAll right.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:00.000\nWe gotta move on.\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:03.000\nCan we move the fuck on with the fucking show?\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:04.000\nSchrab.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:08.000\nBecause I got a lot of shit to do tonight.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:11.000\nA lot of shit.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:12.000\nAll right.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nHey, I'm gonna yell at me.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:16.000\nI've had it with you.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:17.000\nI know.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nLet's bring out both...\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:20.000\nWait, wait.\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:21.000\nHold on.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:22.000\nI'm gonna figure out what order to do this in.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:23.000\nBecause we gotta check...\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nDo it in the right order.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:26.000\nI'm trying to...\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:27.000\nWell, I'm trying to figure out what that is.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:28.000\nMmm.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:29.000\nThat fucking hot sauce guy.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nNow we have him to blame for the whole night.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nThat's what's nice about it.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:34.000\nI liked what happened.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:35.000\nYou liked what happened?\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:36.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:37.000\nIt's not a popular opinion.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:40.000\nWell, it was sort of a defiance of the usual dynamic that I was struggling with.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:44.000\nI was like, well, this is like Evil Knievel goes up to the Grand Canyon and then turns around.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:47.000\nBut like, how entertaining is it that he just goes over the Grand Canyon?\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:48.000\nAnd then he's like, oh, I broke my leg.\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nAnd it's like, what's wrong with our society?\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:56.000\nEvil Knievel was a stuntman from 2,000 years ago.\n\n31:56.000 --> 32:00.000\nFor anybody who doesn't know what Dan is talking about.\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:05.000\nIn case you thought he was an accountant.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:06.000\nI don't know.\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:13.000\nHey, he didn't name himself Evil Knievel because he thought, oh, I only want to be famous in 1975.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nHe's like, they're gonna remember this name.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:18.000\nEven if they don't, they're gonna know what I do from it.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:19.000\nRight.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:20.000\nEvil Knievel.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:25.000\nI'm gonna evil all the Knievels.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:34.000\nAll right, let's bring out both at the same time because they both belong to the same family.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:39.000\nWe talked to Felicia Day last week and these are two good friends of hers.\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:47.000\nThey've both done stuff for geek and sundry if you're a geek sundering around there.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:51.000\nBut they're just two folks that I've always wanted to have a chat with.\n\n32:51.000 --> 33:01.000\nLet's bring out In Order of Gender.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:13.000\nDon't fuck this up, Dan.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nDon't fuck this up.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:19.000\nOh, Jesus, God.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:22.000\nThe chip's like breaking glass.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:27.000\nHe's just gonna pop it in his mouth and start screaming.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:31.000\nI'll do it for you, man.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:34.000\nIn Order of Gender descending.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.000\nOh, God.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:37.000\nWhat?\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nYou don't know who I'm bringing up first.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:40.000\nHow is that an O?\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:42.000\nOh, because I'm pitting the genders against each other.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:43.000\nYeah, you can't do that anymore.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:46.000\nIn Order of Gender randomly.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:55.000\nAnd also, while recognizing that either one of them at any given time,\n\n33:55.000 --> 34:00.000\nwe do not have the right to know what's going on in either of their pants or their brains.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:01.000\nTrue.\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nAnd gender shouldn't be a thing.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:04.000\nWhy?\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nI did it!\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\nLegalize it!\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:10.000\nLegalize it!\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\nLegalize it!\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nLegalize it!\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:16.000\nLegalize it!\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nLegalize it!\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nLegalize it!\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nLegalize it!\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nLegalize lack of gender?\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.000\nYep.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nThis guy, when you tried to do the butter, he was like,\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nHe went like that, and then I said,\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nsorry, and he went, oh, you're good.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nAnd I was like, well, you're not then.\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:35.000\nYou're not good.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:36.000\nI don't want to.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nBecause I thought maybe he was like, I'm in pain.\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:39.000\nStop.\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:40.000\nNo.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:43.000\nBut he's just like, no, I'm terrible at your stage dive.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:44.000\nI don't want to.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:48.000\nI don't want to do it.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:51.000\nI wouldn't know how to participate in a stage dive.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:52.000\nI've only done one.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:57.000\nAnd I mean...\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:58.000\nHe's too far back, though.\n\n34:58.000 --> 34:59.000\nThat's a problem.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:00.000\nToo far back!\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:01.000\nIs that Dave Kline?\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:02.000\nOh, Dave Kline's here.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:06.000\nI bet Dave Kline would have you.\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:09.000\nFor dinner.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nHe's Dracula.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:16.000\nYou guys reacted like that was just a Dracula joke.\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:17.000\nAll right.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:18.000\nGod damn it.\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:19.000\nLet's bring out our fucking guests.\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:20.000\nYou're the host.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:21.000\nI can't help it.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:22.000\nDid you get control of your own show?\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:25.000\nI have no idea where the vaginas and penises are\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:26.000\non either of them.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\nSay both at the same time.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:29.000\nOne's a writer.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:30.000\nOne's a...\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nI might offend one of them that way, too.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:33.000\nI don't...\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:36.000\nThey're just nerds doing what we do.\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:38.000\nThey're part of our family.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:41.000\nLet's bring out randomly...\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nAmy Berg and Will Wheaton.\n\n35:43.000 --> 36:02.000\nI hope you guys like chips.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.000\nI'm so glad you didn't eat that.\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:05.000\nOh, good.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:06.000\nThat's great.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:07.000\nThank you.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nWell, you're going to waste our night, man.\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nSo what's the worst you've ever seen?\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:12.000\nYou'd be crying.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:14.000\nYou'd have to go to the bathroom.\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:15.000\nReally?\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:16.000\nYeah, you'd be sobbing.\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:18.000\nSo they have stuff they make that's like...\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nThat's what that is, literally.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:24.000\nYou would be getting blood for like four hours.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:25.000\nI just...\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:26.000\nOkay.\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:27.000\nI mean, I don't want the kids.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:28.000\nFood that's based on a dare.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nJust go have dim sum.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:31.000\nSo I kept trying to say,\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:34.000\nI'm not that kind of show kid.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:35.000\nAnd he's like,\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nI'm like, your sister told you don't embarrass her.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nAnd he's like, but she's my sister.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:41.000\nThis is the telekinetic conversation.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:42.000\nYeah.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:43.000\nTelekinetic.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:47.000\nWe've moved each other's eyebrows.\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:50.000\nSo anyways, so last couple of weeks I've had authors on\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:52.000\nwho have books that I've read before the thing.\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nAnd then I walked through the entire book.\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nAnd some people enjoy it and some people don't.\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:57.000\nBut I just wanted to like,\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:58.000\nwe could just hang out, right?\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nBecause I researched your guys' shit today\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:02.000\nand I'm excited because of that to talk to you guys.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nBut I'm hoping we can...\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nI want to hang out and talk nonsense,\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:08.000\nhopefully, for most of the time.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:09.000\nWhy did I say that?\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:10.000\nWhat are you supposed to do?\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:11.000\nNo, I want to talk about...\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:14.000\nI'd like to talk about the series issues.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:16.000\nOr the book I...\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:18.000\nI prefer sense.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nBut also the thing is,\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nI don't know where to start because we have...\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nBecause there's another friend I want to bring up here tonight.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:25.000\nI want to check in with him.\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nAnd I'm trying to figure out...\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nI'm not talking about my dick or anything.\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:30.000\nIs that why you...\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:31.000\nOh.\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:32.000\nOh.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:33.000\nWhere are they laughing at?\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:34.000\nMy hair went up in the air?\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:35.000\nThe maybe.\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:36.000\nThat's...\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:37.000\nIt looked good.\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nThat's their deal breaker with my hair?\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:40.000\nThis is the first...\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:43.000\nYo, Dan's hair looked like shit tonight.\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:45.000\nIt's like he doesn't know how to take care of himself.\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:46.000\nI just couldn't get into the show.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:48.000\nI couldn't get past that.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:51.000\nI come here from Burbank to...\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:54.000\nto see a guy whose hair looks good.\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:55.000\nYeah.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:56.000\nAll the time.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:57.000\nI wanted to see somebody with bad hair.\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nI wouldn't have gone to the Hollywood Bowl tonight.\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:00.000\nOh.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.000\nOoh, Hollywood Bowl.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:03.000\nVan Halen.\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:04.000\nOoh.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:09.000\nThese guys, I don't understand them ever.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:10.000\nAlmost ever.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:11.000\nOoh, the Hollywood Bowl.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nBut they were really helpful about the chip.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nThey were very protective and helpful with the hot sauce.\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:16.000\nYeah.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:17.000\nYou guys were looking out.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:20.000\nBut then you say something like Hollywood Bowl and they're like racist.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:21.000\nI know.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:22.000\nIt's terrible.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:23.000\nWell...\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:24.000\nOoh.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:25.000\nYeah.\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:26.000\nI don't know.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.000\nI'm assuming with the best of intentions.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:29.000\nI think they're good kids.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nI think they're going to make a great society.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:32.000\nYeah.\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:33.000\nYeah.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:34.000\nYou're welcome.\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:40.000\nI'm sorry about the earth burning to a cinder when you're 38.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nGood luck.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:45.000\nSeriously, millennials, learn how to swim.\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:48.000\nIt is a skill you're going to.\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:49.000\nAlso, yeah.\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:50.000\nAnd you know what?\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:51.000\nForget the apostrophe thing.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:52.000\nI've been on you for 20 years.\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:54.000\nJust forget it at this point.\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:55.000\nYou're...\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:56.000\nYou're...\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:57.000\nWho cares?\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\nWe are going to die.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nIt doesn't matter anymore.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nI'm not mad at you anymore.\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:04.000\nWho cares?\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:06.000\nDon't learn to spell.\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:09.000\nIt would be wasting your time at this point.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nYou'd be wasting your time.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:15.000\nJust keep...\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:18.000\nSo Amy Berg, like a no-necessary order.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:21.000\nHere's the random things I want to talk to you guys about.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nAmy is working on this show right now.\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nIt's not on yet at all.\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:29.000\nAs you said, you were doing a 10-episode order and then they're going to air it later.\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:32.000\nSo I'm assuming this is like some new media thing.\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:33.000\nLike this isn't CBS.\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:34.000\nNo, it's stars.\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:35.000\nIt's premium cable.\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:36.000\nStars, okay.\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:38.000\nPremium cable.\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:39.000\nWoo!\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nOoh la la!\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nOw!\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:47.000\nThat means we can have sexy time.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:50.000\nAnd swearing, which is more important to me.\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:52.000\nBut they killed Party Down.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:54.000\nThey're the worst ever.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nYay!\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:57.000\nAlso my favorite.\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nRacist.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:05.000\nWhat star slogan?\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:06.000\nWhat stars?\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:09.000\nWhere the...\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:10.000\nWatch...\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:11.000\nWatch...\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:12.000\nWatch us.\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:14.000\nCause we're...\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nThere.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:18.000\nAnd we're bright.\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:20.000\nAt night.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:25.000\nWe put the Z in movies.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:26.000\nI like it.\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:29.000\nI'll watch them.\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:36.000\nTheir slogan is because you wouldn't watch writers.\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:42.000\nAnd they just have a picture of us, me and Amy, like with potato chips in our hands.\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.000\nBecause who wants to watch writers?\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:45.000\nRight.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:48.000\nAnd then it pans to me and they're like, no, we don't want to watch hit.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:50.000\nWhat stars?\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:51.000\nDo we get HBO?\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:55.000\nAnyways, this show you're working on, I was so excited you just described it.\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:59.000\nJ.K. Simmons, who's like I've loved since Law and Order.\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nSince Law and Order?\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:04.000\nThat's your J.K. reference?\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:06.000\nWhat is he before that?\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:07.000\nSpider-Man.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\nWho's Oz, which is an awesome show.\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nNo, that's after Law and Order though, isn't it?\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:12.000\nWell, that's true.\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:15.000\nYeah, so I'm OG.\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:19.000\nI got so scared I was going to find out he was Butch Cassidy.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:24.000\nNo, I could have sworn there was Paul Newman.\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:27.000\nI thought I was going to get really like shamed for, you know.\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:30.000\nBut no, I'm clearly the superior J.K. Simmons fan.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:33.000\nI was like, who's that guy that they're going to?\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:36.000\nI hope this person's mentally ill, or at least there's a question of it.\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:39.000\nBecause he would play the, because that means we get to see that guy.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:45.000\nEmil Skoda was his character's name, then I saw him in Juno and I was like, I like that guy again.\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:49.000\nI hope he's in all of stuff and then he was.\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nThat's me.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:55.000\nSo he, we can talk about the show, right?\n\n41:55.000 --> 42:01.000\nYou said it, it's called Point of Departure, Counterparts, Counterparts.\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:02.000\nCounterpart.\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:03.000\nCounterpart.\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:04.000\nYes.\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:09.000\nIt's about a split universe, but the universe knows it's split.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:10.000\nYes.\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:16.000\nIt's like parallel timelines that shared one history, but they actively split and they know they split.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:22.000\nSo J.K. Simmons is playing two different versions of himself and it's like a spy Cold War thing going back.\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:23.000\nYeah.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:30.000\nThat's my audience.\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:36.000\nJust in case somebody wasn't paying attention, maybe repeat that.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:37.000\nJust in case.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:40.000\nNo, their reaction made you think that you should, you should have missed it.\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:41.000\nSee, that's what happens when you...\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:44.000\nI don't know why I'm in this conversation.\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:46.000\nYou described it better than I could have, I think.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:47.000\nThat's pretty great.\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:48.000\nThis is what I do.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:49.000\nThat's how I interview people.\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:50.000\nIt sounds like a really fucking cool show.\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.000\nI bring them out and I go, your book's about autism.\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:53.000\nAnd they go, it is.\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nAnd I'm like, ginkabugabugabugaboo.\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:59.000\nLet's have a hand.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:03.000\nI'm getting a little sick of myself lately.\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nWell, I mean, anything else to say about it?\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:06.000\nYou guys are working on it.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:07.000\nDo you think it's good?\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:08.000\nYou can't say otherwise.\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:10.000\nNo, it's actually really good.\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:16.000\nThere's a genre that they've invented for the show called spy-fi.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:17.000\nI'll take it.\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:18.000\nI like it.\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:19.000\nNo.\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:20.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:22.000\nYou will take it, will we?\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:23.000\nNo, listen.\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:24.000\nI love the genre.\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:26.000\nI love the idea of the genre.\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:28.000\nThat name is way too cute.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nI'm not okay with that.\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:31.000\nHow is it spelled?\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:32.000\nThe show is not cute.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:34.000\nWell, the why aren't I spy-fi?\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:35.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:36.000\nGood question.\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:37.000\nDo you know?\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:38.000\nIt's who fucking knows.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:39.000\nOkay.\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:40.000\nWell, we're going to find out.\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:41.000\nIt's going to start out spelled the right way.\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nAnd then right around the time you really get into it,\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nthey're going to change the spelling of it.\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nAnd then all the content is just going to go to hell.\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:48.000\nYou mean like those fucking Berenstein bears?\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:50.000\nLike the Berenstein bears.\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:51.000\nExactly like them.\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nWill, have I ever told you about that?\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:54.000\nYeah.\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\nNo, Will was just going on about that.\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:58.000\nYou guys all know about it.\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:01.000\nI've been, I swear to God, five years before this hit the internet,\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:05.000\nI was like, you guys, they changed the names on the bears.\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:08.000\nAnd then like now, you know, no one cared or believed me.\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:13.000\nBut now, now fucking everyone's on that goddamn Berenstein bears trap.\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:16.000\nYou are like the hipster of Berenstein bears.\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:17.000\nYeah.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:22.000\nAre you, are you, are you being like a reality blurring event hipster?\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:23.000\nYeah.\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:26.000\nI was there before reality blurred and, you know,\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:27.000\nno one believed it was blurred.\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:28.000\nYeah.\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:29.000\nBut that's the whole point.\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:30.000\nWe were all there before reality blurred.\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:33.000\nWhich is why we all remember the name being the right way.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nAnd we know that it's not the way it is now.\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nDo you guys know what this Berenstein bears thing is?\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:38.000\nAll right.\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:39.000\nThen I don't have to explain.\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nYou can Google it.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:42.000\nAnother thing you should.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:43.000\nYour name changed.\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:44.000\nOkay.\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:45.000\nContinue.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nAnother thing you should goggle is Will's show.\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:48.000\nGoggle.\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:49.000\nWhat are you saying?\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:50.000\nIt's pronounced goggle.\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:51.000\nIt always has.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:56.000\nI could have done that for an hour.\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:58.000\nBut I'm not that confident.\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:03.000\nThe, but, but, but at Geek and Sundry is, is your thing,\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:04.000\nbecause I know you did that show Caper.\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:07.000\nI watched an episode of that today for, for,\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:08.000\nand Fleece Executive Produce,\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:11.000\nbecause that was on Geek and Sundry and Hulu at the same time,\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:12.000\nbecause you guys had to deal with Hulu.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:15.000\nAnd is Tabletop on Hulu as well?\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.000\nI don't know.\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.000\nI think it, you know, I think we talked to them about it.\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:22.000\nI know it's on Netflix, but I don't know if it's on Hulu,\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:27.000\nbut I do know that it has a huge audience on the pirate bay,\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:30.000\nwhich I think is awesome because it lets me know that,\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:33.000\nlike, there's a lot of people that want to watch this,\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:34.000\nthat for whatever reason,\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:37.000\nI don't know YouTube is blocked in their country or something.\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:38.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nThat's the geo blocking thing is like explains a lot of the piracy,\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nbecause it's like people don't want to watch a pro commercial,\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nyou know, but I just, I think it's cool.\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:46.000\nI think like, like when, when there is,\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.000\nwhen there's an audience demand for a show that isn't being\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nserved in some way and the audience is like,\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:51.000\ngive us the show.\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nI mean, like, I love that.\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:54.000\nOf course.\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:55.000\nThat's what I mean.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nIt's like, yeah, how do you feel about piracy?\n\n45:57.000 --> 46:00.000\nWell, we're supposed to be making things that are basically free\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:03.000\nand addictive and we're like, we're going to get offended that,\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:04.000\nyeah, it's dumb.\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:09.000\nI view piracy as a failure on behalf of the industry\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nto serve the needs of the audience.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:12.000\nOf course.\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nAnd they would, too, if they knew how to serve them,\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:15.000\nbecause then they could charge them.\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:18.000\nLike, like, we were, you know, oh God, MP3 technology.\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:19.000\nOh my God.\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:22.000\nAnd then iTunes is like, no, that means now you can listen to music\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:24.000\nmore than ever for a dollar.\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:25.000\nAnd everyone's like, that's fine.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:26.000\nAnd Apple's like, we have a billion dollars.\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nAnd everyone's like, that's fine, too.\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:29.000\nMusic industry saved.\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:30.000\nGo, go, go.\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:33.000\nSorry, we wasted 15 years of your life taking it to the Supreme Court,\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.000\nlike we did with cassette tapes before that.\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nWell, home taping is killing music.\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nI've seen the tape.\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:44.000\nBut anyways, the, the, but you're, the show, Tabletop,\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:48.000\nlike I, I'm like, you turned me around on something.\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.000\nIt took somebody as passionate as you,\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.000\nbecause there has been this revolution.\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:55.000\nAs you say in the show, like once upon a time,\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:57.000\nthere was this thing called D&D.\n\n46:57.000 --> 47:00.000\nAnd we, like people of our generation were like, oh,\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:03.000\nthe, like the pencils and the dice and the complicated rules\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:04.000\nand the million books.\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nAnd, and like just the, the Harry Potter,\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\nbut more complicated of it all.\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.000\nThat's the secret society of it.\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\nLike the fact that it was the opposite of football,\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:15.000\nto, including the fact that if you talked about it in front of other people,\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:20.000\nthey would, they would actually actively like back up from you.\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nAnd that was kind of like part of the appeal.\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:23.000\nAnd, and,\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nYou have completely described my childhood.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:26.000\nMe too.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:27.000\nYeah.\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:29.000\nIt was, it was like, it was sort of, I mean, it's the same thing.\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:30.000\nThat's what kids do.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:31.000\nIf they're going to be exceptional,\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nthey have to practice being exceptional in school\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:36.000\nwhile the other kids practice being part of a horrible mindless hoard.\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:40.000\nAnd, and, and they end up doing great because everything is for them.\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:42.000\nAnd not a tear in my eye for them.\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:45.000\nBut, but, but, but every, the rest of us,\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:47.000\nand sometimes it seems like the majority of us,\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.000\nlike we're also practicing in that grade.\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nAnd we have to practice like fucking not giving a shit.\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:53.000\nAnd so we, we, this is not my point.\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:56.000\nYour point was like that people like me,\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:59.000\nI'm one of these people that you were kind of talking about\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nbetween the lines is like a purist who therefore,\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:03.000\nwhen I hear the word tabletop, I'm like,\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:06.000\nyou mean like ever since magic, the gathering,\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:08.000\nI think was the sort of beginning of it for me.\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:10.000\nMy experience was like, wait.\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:11.000\nThat's a fine game.\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:12.000\nWell, I mean, that's a look.\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:13.000\nWhat do you, yes.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:14.000\nOkay.\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:17.000\nWhat the hell am I in the middle of saying that I was wrong?\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nThat it was, but it was like, oh, it's cards,\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:21.000\nbut instead of the thing, you know, it's like,\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:22.000\nsomehow it was wrong.\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:25.000\nBut then, so he does this show called tabletop where he like,\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:28.000\nhe just like is just very, very enthusiastic about the million\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:31.000\ntypes of games that are sort of like they're,\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:33.000\nthey're halfway between those things that we used to play\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:36.000\nthat are really complicated and things that we remember\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:38.000\nfrom, from our other half of our childhood,\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:41.000\nlike Monopoly and like when mom and dad weren't fighting,\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:44.000\nlike the, the shoots and ladders and, you know,\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:46.000\nlike, like, like the board, there's, there's something\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:49.000\nbetween this, this new era of these thousands of games\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:52.000\nsomewhere between board game and, and, and role playing.\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:55.000\nIt is weird to play ants in the pants without the sound\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:57.000\nof dishes breaking kitchen.\n\n48:57.000 --> 49:01.000\nThat is a, that is a strange experience for me.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:04.000\nYou know, when Felicia asked me if I wanted to do a show\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:08.000\nfor Geek and Sundry, I said yes because she's,\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:11.000\neverything that she's done has been really smart\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:14.000\nand really interesting and, and I love the idea of\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:18.000\nbeing able to create and produce in a medium where\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:22.000\nI wasn't going to be answering to like a network douchebag\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:25.000\nwho didn't understand the audience.\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:27.000\nI did that when I worked with sci-fi.\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:30.000\nBut, but with, with, with this show she said,\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:31.000\nso what do you want to do?\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:33.000\nAnd I said, you know, I don't know, I want to do something\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:34.000\nbut I don't know what.\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:36.000\nAnd she said, well, how about a show where you review,\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:37.000\nget board games.\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:38.000\nI know how much you love board games.\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:40.000\nAnd I said, you know, I think honestly the best way\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.000\nto review a board game is to just play the board game\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:45.000\nand show people how much fun it is and oh, and the,\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:47.000\nthe idea like exploded in my brain.\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:49.000\nLike it all came together all at once.\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\nI will be the first person to say on paper that sounds\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:52.000\nlike a really terrible idea.\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:55.000\nLike, like, you literally play a game with your family\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:56.000\nfor two episodes.\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nLike it's your family.\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:01.000\nYes.\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:03.000\nThat just sounds like, not really sure where you're going\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:04.000\nwith that.\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:06.000\nYou know exactly where I'm going because you know how\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:07.000\nthat sounds on paper.\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:08.000\nYeah, but my family's red.\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:11.000\nI know it turns out, but it turns out.\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:13.000\nI wouldn't, I wouldn't put my family on my show\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:15.000\nif they were lame.\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:18.000\nI'd be like, sorry guys, I'm going to hire some actors\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:20.000\nto be my family who are lame.\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nDid you, did you adopt from, from, from Asgard\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:23.000\nor something?\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:25.000\nYour children are, you're both, you're,\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:27.000\nyou have two boys at that table.\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nThey both are nine feet tall.\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:32.000\nThey, they, they look like, they both look like Thor.\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:33.000\nYeah.\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:35.000\nIn fact, my son Nolan's in Germany right now\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:38.000\nand people keep coming up to him and taking pictures\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:42.000\nwith him because they're like Thor, Thor, Thor.\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\nYou know, Dave, Dave Kline likes that.\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:47.000\nHe's descended from Thor as well.\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:49.000\nIt's interesting that you say it sounds like a bad idea\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:52.000\nbecause I thought that the success of a show like\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:57.000\nCelebrity Poker and, and the success of just shows\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:59.000\nwhere you like watch people, you know,\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:01.000\nyou watch people play cards and stuff, I thought,\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:03.000\nwell, this is something that I'm super passionate about\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:05.000\nand what's going to make this show live is not\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:06.000\nwhat's happening on the table.\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\nIt's what's happening with the people around the table.\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:09.000\nRight.\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nAnd I was a huge fan of Dinner for Five and I wanted\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:14.000\nto like put together those two shows and,\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:16.000\nand have people come in and do, you know,\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:18.000\nand, and, and just play these games that I love.\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:20.000\nWell, it works really well.\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nIt works, one of the things that makes it work really well\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:25.000\nis that you, you played this game Dread,\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:28.000\nwhich is like this, this indie game that is a stack\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nof things you can't call Jenga.\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:31.000\nYeah.\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:33.000\nBut like, and it's similar to, but legally distinctly\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:35.000\ndifferent from, from Jenga.\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:37.000\nIt's just a collaborative storytelling game where\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:39.000\nyou were walking through players through this scenario\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:41.000\nand they were like role playing and they had their\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:43.000\ncharacters figured out, which were figured out by\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:45.000\nquestionnaires, like psychological profiles that\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:47.000\nyou answer for a fictional character that you make up.\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:48.000\nYeah.\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:49.000\nAnd, and then you're just going through it and\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:51.000\ninstead of rolling dice, you pull, it sounds a little\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:53.000\ndumb, but it's like, it works like as a storytelling\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:56.000\nthing. It's like as, as, at key points of the story,\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:58.000\nyou have to like keep pulling these Jenga blocks out.\n\n51:58.000 --> 51:59.000\nYeah.\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:02.000\nAnd then as, as the story becomes more intense and\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:05.000\nas the stakes get higher and higher and the players\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:08.000\nare more like their adrenaline is up, the tower is\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:11.000\nbecoming more and more unstable because you're\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:12.000\npulling blocks out of it.\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:14.000\nAnd when the bottom of the tower falls, the player\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:15.000\npulling from it dies.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:16.000\nRight.\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:17.000\nLike that's it.\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:18.000\nYou're dead.\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nAnd as an actual narrative, it is, it is.\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:21.000\nIt's a great metaphor.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:22.000\nIt's inevitable.\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\nIf you're in a movie, you know that this can't last.\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:25.000\nOtherwise it would be a bad movie.\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:27.000\nLike this camping trip, someone's going to die.\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:29.000\nAnd so you can, and when you're in a really scary\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:31.000\nsituation, that's what scares you.\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:33.000\nYou feel like something's going to happen.\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:35.000\nThat was one of my favorite episodes we've done in\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:36.000\nthree seasons.\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\nAnd I'm really, it means a lot to me though.\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nI'm really glad that you liked it because I wanted\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nto do a thing that was about storytelling.\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:43.000\nRight.\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:46.000\nAnd because I wanted to, that's because your, your\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:50.000\nskills as a GM, I thought were astounding in that,\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.000\nin that thing when you watch it.\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:54.000\nLike your ability to actually, your, your, your,\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:58.000\nyour tonality and your pacing and your like making a,\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:01.000\nit just felt, and then the thing I thought was,\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:03.000\nholy shit, we got to, we got to play something with Will.\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:05.000\nAnd it's like, oh, he'll play Shadowrun with us and Amy\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:06.000\nwill play with us and stuff.\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:10.000\nBut, but also then I thought like the, of this game\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:13.000\nWerewolf that we always played, that Justin Reiland\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:16.000\nintroduced me to with this stupid deck thing.\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:19.000\nWhat are you, you don't like, now you don't like Justin?\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:23.000\nNo, I love Justin.\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nWere you thinking about, were you thinking about\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:26.000\nthe Hollywood Bowl again?\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nAll right, I'm going to try it.\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:33.000\nPulling out cards, we're going to play a game.\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:36.000\nIt's talk to Amy Berg about writing science fiction\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:40.000\nfor, for while I write a W on one of these pieces of paper.\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:41.000\nHi.\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:42.000\nHi.\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:52.000\nSo tell us about your science fiction.\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:53.000\nWow.\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:57.000\nIt's very, it has a lot of science in it, and it's made up.\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:58.000\nIt's pretty great.\n\n53:58.000 --> 53:59.000\nAwesome.\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:00.000\nYou know what, there's people here for this.\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nSomeone do this.\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:04.000\nHere, I'm throwing this one away.\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:05.000\nWe just got started, Dan.\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:08.000\nOne, two, three, four, five.\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:09.000\nDeMorge wasn't here, right?\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:11.000\nI don't see, DeMorge wasn't here?\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:12.000\nNo?\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:13.000\nOkay.\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:14.000\nAll right.\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:18.000\nI need, I need to, hey, Steve Levy, come out here.\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:19.000\nYeah.\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:20.000\nWow.\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:26.000\nIf Jeff were here, he'd say, and the crowd goes mild.\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:29.000\nAll right, so first thing I need is for somebody to write\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:32.000\none, two, three, four, five, six.\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:33.000\nHe's asking you to do stuff.\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:35.000\nNo, he's up here playing with us.\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:36.000\nHe's playing?\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:37.000\nYeah.\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:45.000\nI need somebody to turn this wad of envelopes and this pen into six identical sheets of\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:51.000\npaper, five of which have a, oh, God damn it.\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:52.000\nWhat?\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:53.000\nI'm gonna do it.\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:54.000\nWhat's that?\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:55.000\nYeah.\n\n54:55.000 --> 55:00.000\nLike five of them will have a V on them, and one of them will have a W on it.\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:01.000\nIt's just, it's that simple.\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:02.000\nChrist.\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:03.000\nWhat are you, what are you doing?\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:04.000\nWhat are you doing right now?\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:05.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:07.000\nI'm talking under my breath.\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:08.000\nNo, you're not.\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:09.000\nYou're talking on microphone.\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:10.000\nI know.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:12.000\nIt's the opposite of breath.\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:14.000\nYour breath is ruining the world.\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:17.000\nIt's above, it's above my breath then.\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:22.000\nYour attitude is, is discouraging and disappointing.\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:23.000\nI like it.\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.000\nAnd you know, I came here tonight with a good attitude.\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:27.000\nYour attitude is great.\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:30.000\nThis game fucking sucks.\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:32.000\nYou like this game?\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:33.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:35.000\nYou just check out what you're doing.\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:36.000\nI fucking hate this game.\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:38.000\nYou just always lose.\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:41.000\nI'd rather play baseball than this shit.\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:43.000\nYou go play baseball.\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:45.000\nYou play fucking baseball.\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:47.000\nDoes anybody have a copy of ants in the pants?\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:50.000\nI feel like I should be playing it right now.\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:53.000\nThis is the reason why I don't like games.\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:55.000\nSomebody, somebody just ignore him.\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:56.000\nNever.\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:58.000\nSix sheets of paper.\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:00.000\nSomebody, God damn it.\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:02.000\nFive of them have a V.\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:04.000\nOne of them has a W.\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:05.000\nDon't fuck around.\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:07.000\nI know those are similar letters.\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:09.000\nIt's not going to be,\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:13.000\nyour joke's not going to land if there's a confusion.\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:16.000\nWe might have a good time.\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:19.000\nYou're in charge, Dustin, you're in charge.\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.000\nBecause I'm going to GM,\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:23.000\neven though Will would do a much better job.\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:25.000\nNo, I'm awful at running.\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:26.000\nGame master.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:30.000\nI'm so much better, you're going to see.\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:33.000\nSo, so, what, Dustin, when I cue you.\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:34.000\nI don't want to play.\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:36.000\nHow do we know, wait, wait, wait,\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:38.000\nhow do we know who's looking at who\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:40.000\nwhen it comes time to kill people?\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:42.000\nBecause we're all standing in a line.\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:45.000\nWe got to stand to?\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:47.000\nTo play werewolf.\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:49.000\nShut up, nobody has to see you but me.\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:52.000\nNobody's asking for any of your input on any of this.\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:53.000\nYou guys are pissing me off.\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:54.000\nI'm going to fucking like,\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:56.000\nI'm going to dig a hole and stick you all in it.\n\n56:56.000 --> 57:00.000\nAnd call it a tabletop game called,\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:02.000\nfuck the fuck faces.\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:04.000\nLike, what the fuck?\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:05.000\nYou're going to dig a hole.\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:06.000\nYou two want to talk about it.\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:07.000\nYou're going to dig a hole.\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:09.000\nSteve Levy, he's going to dig a hole.\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:10.000\nYou guys want to talk about hang gliding?\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:12.000\nYou dumb pieces of shit.\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:13.000\nThe fuck do you want to do?\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:15.000\nIt's my goddamn show.\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:16.000\nWe're going to play fucking werewolf.\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:17.000\nAll right.\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:18.000\nAnd you're making it longer.\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:19.000\nAll right, stop yelling.\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:20.000\nThen it would have to be.\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:21.000\nStop yelling.\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:22.000\nYou're hurting his feelings.\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:23.000\nHe's already finished.\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:30.000\nAll right, so anyways, let's have some fun.\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:33.000\nAnd if it doesn't work, Spencer, I tried something.\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:35.000\nI just want to troubleshoot, you know.\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:37.000\nYou shoot yourself, not trouble.\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:39.000\nAvoid the problem when it comes up.\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:41.000\nYou're mad because you see what's happening.\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:42.000\nI'm threatening you.\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:43.000\nI'm not mad.\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:46.000\nI'm not going to turn this into a whole thing.\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:49.000\nI'm not going to become a Game Master professionally.\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:52.000\nYou're going to become a GM.\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:54.000\nIt's going to work.\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:58.000\nAnd I made up my mind about something, and I'm at a very volatile point in my life.\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:04.000\nAnd Will Wheaton's here, and you guys are fucking around.\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:08.000\nAnd that V looks a lot like a fucking W.\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:10.000\nHe's looking at the cards.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:11.000\nHe's always cheating.\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:12.000\nHe's a GM.\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:13.000\nIt's fine.\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:14.000\nI'm cheating.\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:17.000\nI know that I'm going to fucking murder.\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:22.000\nThis is why I never win, because he cheats all the time.\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:24.000\nYeah, because look at the card.\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:27.000\nI'm going to hold them close to my chest.\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:28.000\nYou're not even looking.\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:32.000\nAll right, so Dustin, do you have scary music, like creepy ambient music?\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:35.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:38.000\nGet ready for some scary music.\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:45.000\nI don't suppose you also have kind of nice world of common day music.\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:48.000\nAnd we could go back between the two, like when I cue you.\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:51.000\nIt'd be really cool if we had Castlevania songs.\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:52.000\nYou'd have the day and the night.\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:55.000\nYeah.\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:56.000\nYeah, man.\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:57.000\nCastlevania.\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:58.000\nYou could take a second to fight.\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:02.000\nHas anybody in this room gotten to the last level of Castlevania?\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:03.000\nNo, man.\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:04.000\nRight?\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:07.000\nLike, you can't even get past the level with the Medusa heads, right?\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:08.000\nWith the stairs?\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:09.000\nFuck those guys.\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:10.000\nYeah.\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:12.000\nYeah, it's awful, and it's so hard.\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:13.000\nWhat is he doing?\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.000\nWhat's he doing?\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:17.000\nHe's handing out the things.\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:19.000\nHe's going through with this.\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:21.000\nOkay, nobody look at these.\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:24.000\nI mean, you can look at them, but don't look at them.\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:25.000\nDon't show them to other people.\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:26.000\nDon't let them, sir.\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:27.000\nDon't cheat.\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:28.000\nSo you either have a V or a W.\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:30.000\nIf you have a W, you're the werewolf.\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:34.000\nAnd so everything else is basically kind of a self-explanatory.\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:35.000\nYou gave me two.\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:38.000\nWell, you could pick which one you want.\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:39.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:41.000\nDoes one have a V and one has a W?\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:42.000\nNo, one's blank and one has a W.\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:43.000\nI solved the problem.\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:44.000\nThey both have letters on them.\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:45.000\nOkay.\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:46.000\nPick the one you want.\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:47.000\nStart over.\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:48.000\nNo, no, we're good.\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:49.000\nWe're good.\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.000\nYou guys are doing this on purpose.\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:52.000\nI'm good.\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:53.000\nYou're not good.\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:57.000\nYou can't do it that way.\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:58.000\nSteve's good.\n\n59:58.000 --> 59:59.000\nNo, he's not good.\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nNo, give me your papers back.\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nGive them back.\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000\nIt has the same letter.\n\n01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nWe're going to have fucking fun tonight.\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nGive me your papers back.\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nGive me your shit, give them back.\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nI'm having a ball.\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nPiece of shit.\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nYou were a villager.\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nYeah, no, I was.\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nI knew it.\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nWho is the werewolf?\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nI think it was Amy Bird.\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nOh, who is the werewolf?\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nShut up.\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nThat's my guess.\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nOh, no.\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nI'm angry with all of you.\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nSpencer was right about that.\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nYeah, no, I know.\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nI'm really sorry.\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nWho is the werewolf?\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000\nI tweeted Will about this.\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nI was like, what if we played werewolf?\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nI was so excited.\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nAnd he's like, I don't know if that'll work.\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nAnd I was like, fuck you, Will Wheaton.\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nFuck you.\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nTwo.\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nFuck you.\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nYou don't know anything about gaming?\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nI was a little taken aback by the use of all caps.\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nAnd the emojis were very intense.\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nThe black Santa means I'm kidding.\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nI really wish I'd known that six hours ago.\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nYou guys are texting each other.\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nYeah, no, I'm going to text you instead.\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nMaybe if you had more fun playing games, you could get in on this.\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nGod damn it.\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nThank you, sir.\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nNever returns my shit texts.\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nMake it real discreet.\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nGod forbid this was done wrong.\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nAll right.\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nI counted too many.\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nThat's what happened.\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nThat's not a werewolf.\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nWe did it.\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nWe did it.\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nOkay.\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nHave a good night, everybody.\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nOkay.\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nSo here we go.\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nWe're just going to play.\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nWe're just going to play.\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nYou know how to play.\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nYou guys know.\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nYou guys know what's going on.\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nIs this a scary music?\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nThis is ordinary.\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nYou know stories don't start scary, Amy Berg.\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nYou know it starts with the nice version of J.K. Simmons hanging out in his village where we begin our story.\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nIt's a village of happy town where everyone makes their own corn and hangs out and likes each other.\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:22.000\nAnd people who know each other for 20 years treat each other with respect.\n\n01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.000\nThey overcome their compulsions for irony and pettiness.\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nAnd they remember that the town is what's important.\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nYou're going to eat that chip.\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nAre we in a neighboring village?\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:50.000\nHowever...\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.000\nThere's a darkness to every town.\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:04.000\nA sinister underbelly which kind of sounds like a more of a relaxing quit smoking tape.\n\n01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nBut...\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nWhich is really sinister if you don't want to quit smoking because you feel like you have to.\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nA part of the town where cravings no longer exist.\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000\nWhere self-confidence is heightened the following day at work.\n\n01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nThrough the use of dark magics.\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nAnd one of the most horrific symptoms of this dark underbelly.\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nThe insatiable bloodthirsty lycanthrope.\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nOtherwise known as the werewolf.\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000\nWerewolf?\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000\nHere, wolf.\n\n01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nHere in the town of happy town.\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nOne of these villagers up here is not just a villager.\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:58.000\nOne of you is a fucking monster.\n\n01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nBut during the day you walk around and you hang out and you act like friends.\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nAnd then at night you turn into dickheads.\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000\nMonsters.\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nMonster dickheads.\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000\nBecause it's not enough.\n\n01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nEverything's going to be eaten and destroyed.\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000\nWhat do I do in this town?\n\n01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nWatch everyone to go to sleep.\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nThat means you close your eyes.\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nEveryone up here close your eyes.\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nAm I married?\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nLower the lights.\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nClose the eyes.\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000\nHang your heads down.\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000\nAll of you hang your heads down.\n\n01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nDo not be in a position where you would be able to see what any of the other people are doing.\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nDon't be dicks about this.\n\n01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000\nDo not fuck me on this.\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nThis is a fun game and you're going to have fun and you're going to eat shit and die.\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000\nLower the lights.\n\n01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nJust a little bit.\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nWe're worried about the cameras.\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nOkay, I get it.\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000\nI get it.\n\n01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nI get it.\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nI'm covering my eyes.\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nYou're not talking when you sleep.\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000\nYou're a villager and you're sleeping.\n\n01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.000\nAnd you're all dreaming about corn and villaging.\n\n01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nBut one of you isn't dreaming.\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nOne of you spent his day dreaming that he or she was a man or a woman.\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000\nBut that's a different issue that we're not going to tackle with this game because you\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nhave a right to think whatever you want.\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nIt's absolutely your own thing unless the government tries to step in the way and we'll\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000\ndeal with that together and even the werewolves will help us at that point.\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nBecause there are monsters out there that are scarier than werewolves called bigotry.\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nHave I said enough of that shit?\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nCan we move on?\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nJesus Christ, I'm from the 70s.\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nMan meant person.\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nAll right, so one of you is a werewolf.\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nOne of you is a werewolf.\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nWill the person that is the werewolf very, very carefully indicate to me who you are\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nas your wolfy, wolfy, wolfiness.\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nThis werewolf cannot be quenched by sleep.\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nThis werewolf needs human flesh.\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nAnd we'll go out its window into the village and kill one of the villagers.\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nWho will it be, werewolf?\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nOh, werewolf.\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nOkay.\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000\nRegular music, wake up, wake up everybody.\n\n01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nOh, it's such a good day to eat some corn and hang out.\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nBecause there's nothing wrong, society's going to keep going the same way it did.\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nOh, wait, what the fuck?\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000\nSpencer's dead.\n\n01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nHe's ripped open by the well and his blood is in the water.\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nDo I live next door to him?\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nYes, I live next door to him.\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000\nSo I open up the window and I see him ripped up.\n\n01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nIt's not that much of a role-playing game.\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nYes, that's what happens.\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nAm I close to him?\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nSpencer, did you do something important in the town?\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000\nOh, yeah, I was, no, there was just villagers and werewolves.\n\n01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000\nAll right, fade down the music a little.\n\n01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000\nTurns out I don't miss you then.\n\n01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nYou guys have a serious problem because I'm the doctor of this town.\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000\nAnd I recognize this as werewolf bites.\n\n01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nThat means that one of you is a werewolf.\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:12.000\nAnd that means you've got to figure out, you've got to, before sundown, you've got to hang somebody.\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nYou have to kill somebody that might be the werewolf.\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nYes, Rob?\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nIf he was bit, doesn't he turn into a werewolf?\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000\nHe was bit all the way to death.\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000\nHe was eaten.\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000\nIt's not like a vampire.\n\n01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000\nIt's not like a vampire, though.\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000\nWell, it is.\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nExcept there's biting involved.\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nAnd sometimes you turn into the thing that bit you, but that's also...\n\n01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nI saw a thing once where a vampire turned into a werewolf.\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nWho's right? You or the movie I watched?\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000\nWhy am I, why is it either of those?\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nWhy do I have to be against this movie?\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:01.000\nIf a werewolf bit a vampire is immortal, then I would understand if a werewolf bit a vampire,\n\n01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000\nthen obviously the vampire would turn into a werewolf vampire.\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nI have no quarrel with the writer of that.\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nOkay, okay, I just want clarification.\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000\nRoger Corbin says thank you.\n\n01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nI thought we were talking about underworld.\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nI'll take a side of that beckon sale for my...\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nI was going to do a word play.\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nI'll go take a...\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nPut some of those beckon sales on my boat.\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nThey can blow me around.\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000\n50% off on that beckon sale.\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nThose sales are beckoning meh.\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000\nBlow, blow, blow, blow, blow.\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000\nAll this week of beckon sale.\n\n01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000\nFigure out who's the werewolf.\n\n01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000\nI know the werewolf is.\n\n01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000\nYou're fucking dead, shut up.\n\n01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nHow do you think I know?\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.000\nHe's talking, you know, he seems alive.\n\n01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nWho do you think is the werewolf?\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nThere's only four of you.\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000\n9-11.\n\n01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nIt's 9-11.\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000\nOh shit.\n\n01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nWhich is the other answer.\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nI know, there are other things more important than werewolves.\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nBigotry in 9-11.\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000\nWe get it.\n\n01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000\nI feel like there was something I was supposed to remember about this.\n\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nAlright, who's the werewolf?\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000\nYou guys are ruining the game by not guessing.\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000\nWhy did you fucking look at me?\n\n01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nIt would be amazing if it were you, Schrab.\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nIt would be amazing.\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nI want to vote for you to be the werewolf just because it's poetically perfect.\n\n01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000\nOh no, maybe Will Wheaton's the werewolf.\n\n01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000\nOh, maybe I am the werewolf and I'm trying to throw suspicion off from me.\n\n01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nYeah.\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000\nOr maybe you're the werewolf and you're trying to throw suspicion onto me.\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nCould be, but- You were the first one to look at me.\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000\nMe?\n\n01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nYes.\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000\nI just love you.\n\n01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000\nDo you love him enough to eat him to death?\n\n01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000\nLike you ate Spencer to death?\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nYou're pretty vocal.\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nI think Steve's getting really defensive right now so he's clearly the werewolf.\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nOh man, you're going to be so wrong.\n\n01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nAlright, I don't know how the process should work.\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000\nI'm the kind of three everyone pointed who they think the werewolf is.\n\n01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000\nOne, two, three.\n\n01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000\nOh man.\n\n01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000\nOh shit.\n\n01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nYou guys dragged Steve Levy into the courtyard.\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nOh, take off his pants, man.\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nAnd you take off his pants and you-\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nTake off that pants, man.\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000\nScary music.\n\n01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nYeah.\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000\nLow lights.\n\n01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nLow lights.\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000\nTake off his pants.\n\n01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nMake it all six in.\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000\nAnd you hang him.\n\n01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nYeah.\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000\nYou hang him and he dies.\n\n01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nYeah.\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000\nOh, we hang him.\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nBut as he dies-\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000\nOh, look at the pants are all-\n\n01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nHe doesn't turn back into-\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000\nHe doesn't turn into briefly into a werewolf\n\n01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000\nand then turn back into a person and say thank you,\n\n01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000\nwhich is what werewolves do when they die.\n\n01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000\nNo.\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000\nHe simply hangs there and dies.\n\n01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nAnd I, the doctor go up and I feel his foot and I go,\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nthis guy was human.\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000\nWhy did you feel his foot before we hung up?\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000\nBecause you can't tell unless the foot is dead.\n\n01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nWhy?\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nAre you a doctor?\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000\nYou-\n\n01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nYou hanged me.\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nSchrab.\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nWell, if I knew feeling the foot was an option,\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000\nwe would have-\n\n01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nYou can only do that after they're dead.\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nNow three villagers remain.\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nAnd one is a werewolf.\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000\nClose your eyes and go to sleep, villagers.\n\n01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000\nI'm not tired.\n\n01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000\nI want to wake because somebody just got fucking mauled and hung.\n\n01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nYou think I'm gonna sleep in this shit?\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000\nFuck that, man.\n\n01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nI'm just sleeping.\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000\nMy eyes open.\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000\nYeah, I'm with Rob.\n\n01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000\nYeah, we're gonna stay up all night.\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nAll right, fine.\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nStay up all night.\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000\nFine, stay up all night.\n\n01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nOkay.\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000\nFine, that's what you do.\n\n01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nYeah, silver bullet.\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000\nYou stay up all night.\n\n01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nSilver bullet.\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nTurn the daylight music back on.\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000\nYou stay up all night.\n\n01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000\nSo obviously one of you is still a werewolf\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000\nthat just stayed up all night with you.\n\n01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000\nAnd now you have to live tired with a werewolf all day again.\n\n01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nShit, I gotta-\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000\nYou sleep.\n\n01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nNow you're fucking tired.\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nAnd we can do that over and over all week.\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nYou do it for a thousand years.\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000\nYou don't sleep.\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nEventually you sleep.\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000\nEverybody sleeps.\n\n01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nAll right.\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nYou're going to sleep.\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000\nAll right.\n\n01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000\nNow put the scary music on.\n\n01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nAll right.\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nWe're gonna have fucking fun.\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000\nYou're losing the audience.\n\n01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nYou're losing the audience.\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000\nI'm not losing.\n\n01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nThat guy has to take a shit.\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nOkay.\n\n01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000\nScary, scary fun.\n\n01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000\nFun, scary music.\n\n01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000\nUh-oh.\n\n01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000\nBatman.\n\n01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nOkay.\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000\nAll right.\n\n01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000\nI want you to tell all your friends about me, he says.\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000\nBatman, we lost Batman.\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000\nWhy did he do anything?\n\n01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000\nHe's the first guy you'd lose in a nuanced thing.\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000\nTwo people have died already.\n\n01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000\nWell, he can.\n\n01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000\nHe's like, I'm gonna go do something about this.\n\n01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000\nGo to sleep.\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000\nMaybe Batman's the werewolf.\n\n01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nAll right, I'm tired.\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000\nI gotta get up and work in the morning.\n\n01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000\nGo to sleep.\n\n01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000\nClose your eyes.\n\n01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000\nAnd hang your heads.\n\n01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000\nOh, God.\n\n01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000\nIf you don't like the game, the best way to finish it is to do it.\n\n01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nSo fine.\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000\nGo to sleep.\n\n01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nIt's very upset with all of you.\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000\nExcept, I don't know, well, Will and Amy have been fine.\n\n01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000\nAnd Steve.\n\n01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000\nReally, it's Schrab, obviously.\n\n01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000\nAnd a little bit, Spencer, for egging you on.\n\n01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000\nI'm trying to help.\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000\nI don't...\n\n01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000\nThank you for driving me around for two years.\n\n01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000\nI love it.\n\n01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000\nI'm trying to fucking sleep here.\n\n01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000\nShut the fuck up.\n\n01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000\nAll right.\n\n01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nYou slept to sleep.\n\n01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000\nYeah, Schrab slept us up all night last night.\n\n01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000\nIt's fucked.\n\n01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000\nIt's hard to sleep, even though you're tired.\n\n01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000\nSo fucking tired of this game.\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000\nYou know, there's no game.\n\n01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000\nYou're in the game, so you don't know there's a game.\n\n01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000\nThat would be unmarketable.\n\n01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000\nOh, that canine thirst for blood.\n\n01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000\nOh, that lupine hunger for the kibble\n\n01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nthat cannot be provided by name brand products.\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nOh, wherewolf awake and indicate to me\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000\nwho you are going to eat next.\n\n01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nI think I understand.\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000\nAll right, normal music and daylight.\n\n01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000\nYou guys wake up.\n\n01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nI'm still fucking alive.\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000\nAnd you're still tired because you wasted that whole night\n\n01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000\nand it didn't help anything because now\n\n01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000\nI was strangled with typewriter ribbon\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nnext to a half finished TV pilot\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nthat would have been fucking great.\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000\nIt could be me.\n\n01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000\nI could be a TV pilot writer.\n\n01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nIs it me?\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000\nWe all know fully well the best writer up here\n\n01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nis Amy Burke.\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nNow slain by wherewolf.\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nEaton.\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nEaton devoured.\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000\nHer bones licked clean.\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000\nYeah.\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000\nYour fault, kind of.\n\n01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nNo.\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000\nHow is it my fault?\n\n01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000\nBecause you fucked around.\n\n01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000\nInstead of playing the game, which you now have to do,\n\n01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000\nit's a matter of life or death.\n\n01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000\nThere is, wait.\n\n01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nWait, how do you outvote each other?\n\n01:16:25.000 -->

werewolf.\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000\nFuck you.\n\n01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000\nYou lost.\n\n01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000\nAnd that's fun.\n\n01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nBut the day.\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000\nThat was a fun game.\n\n01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000\nI had a lot of fun playing that game.\n\n01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000\nEat the chip if you hate everything so much.\n\n01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000\nNo, I'm not going to eat the chip.\n\n01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nYeah, everyone wants you to do it now.\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000\nEat the chip.\n\n01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000\nEat the chip, you pussy.\n\n01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000\nNow I'm not going to eat the chip.\n\n01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nI was going to wait for it to be really, really funny,\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nand now I'm not going to even wait.\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nYeah, but it's Chekhov's chip, man.\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000\nHe's right.\n\n01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000\nIt's Chekhov's chip.\n\n01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000\nIt's been there since the first act.\n\n01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000\nHe read Chekhov's chip.\n\n01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000\nRob loves reading.\n\n01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:26.000\nThat's why he loves me.\n\n01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nThat's right.\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nBecause you went to art school.\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000\nRight.\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nAnd I went to writing school.\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000\nYou went to word school.\n\n01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nAnd I went to word school, and you went to art school.\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.000\nRob, when I met Rob, one of Rob's big pet peeves\n\n01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nwas the word utensil, which he swore was invented\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nby smart people to make him feel stupid.\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000\nWriting utensil.\n\n01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nWriting utensil.\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000\nBecause the word is utensil.\n\n01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000\nExcuse me, could I have a writing utensil?\n\n01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000\nJust say pencil.\n\n01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000\nMaybe you don't want a pencil.\n\n01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000\nThen say that.\n\n01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000\nBut what if they're both there?\n\n01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nThen say what you want.\n\n01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nWhat if you don't know what to do?\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000\nWhat if you don't know what you want?\n\n01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000\nMaybe you want to be polite because you're talking\n\n01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nto someone who's not that smart.\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nCan I have a writing utensil?\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000\nOK.\n\n01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nAll right.\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nWell, now, do you hate instrument just as much?\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000\nNo.\n\n01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nI'm fine with that.\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nWriting instrument doesn't bother you?\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000\nNo.\n\n01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000\nWriting utensil.\n\n01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nCould I have a writing utensil, please?\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nJust say pencil, dude.\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nI might be hashtag team Rob tonight.\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nWell, he's always more entertaining,\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nbut it's because he's disruptive.\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000\nHe waits until something's happening,\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nand then he disrupts it.\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nThat's like a luxury for him.\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000\nYou know, it's like, if you sit around, everybody.\n\n01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nAh!\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:04.000\nYeah, must be nice having that job.\n\n01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000\nHe's like Pizza Hut's Noid.\n\n01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nWas it Domino's?\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nWas the Noid from Domino's?\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000\nDo you know the reason why they stopped doing the Noid?\n\n01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nBecause people didn't know?\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000\nDoes anybody know why?\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000\nDo you know, sir?\n\n01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000\nStand up and tell the Wikipedia.\n\n01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nI think there was a dude who's actually named Noid.\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.000\nHe was paranoid that Domino's was talking to him.\n\n01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nRight.\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000\nYeah.\n\n01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000\nAnd he went into...\n\n01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nThe guy said, for those who didn't hear it,\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nthere was a guy whose name was Noid\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nwho thought that Domino's was like fucking with him.\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nHe was talking to him through the television,\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nso he went into a...\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000\nnot a Pizza Hut, the other one.\n\n01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000\nWith a machine gun, thank you.\n\n01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nAnd started killing people.\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000\nWe have one fucking story in America\n\n01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nthat doesn't end with someone taking a gun somewhere\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nand fucking murdering people.\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000\nI'm so fucking sick of this story.\n\n01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000\nDo you know there's one like...\n\n01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000\nWhat is it, 95 this year?\n\n01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000\nThat's why we lost the Noid.\n\n01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nThat's why we lost him?\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000\nFuck that guy.\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nYep.\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nThe Noid was the one thing that couldn't possibly\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000\nhave had anything to do with a mass shooting.\n\n01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000\nThat's why you loved it.\n\n01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nYou were like, this is safe.\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nNot anymore, apparently.\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nBut how many is it this year, Steve?\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000\nHow many school shootings?\n\n01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000\nWell, it was 45 school shootings.\n\n01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000\nIn a year!\n\n01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000\nAnd now we're making fun of like, you know...\n\n01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nNot even, it's...\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nJeb Bush didn't know what school we were talking about.\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nIt's like, well, come on, it's getting to the fucking point\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nwhere the obscene thing is that it's hard to keep track.\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nIt's a goddamn epidemic.\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nI don't know what my point is.\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000\nI'm not in a soapbox.\n\n01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000\nThere's no one on the other side of this issue.\n\n01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000\nI mean, there are.\n\n01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000\nBy the way, we'll have a conversation about that,\n\n01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000\nbecause I want to say, without...\n\n01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000\nobviously, not a gun nut, not a guy who's like...\n\n01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000\nand it's hard to get into this conversation\n\n01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000\nbecause everyone's hyper-vigilant\n\n01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000\nagainst which person are you.\n\n01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000\nBut speaking as a person who just wants everyone\n\n01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000\nto stop dying and is absolutely fine\n\n01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000\nwith any legislation we need to make happen,\n\n01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nwhatever makes people feel fine,\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000\nbecause I've given up on this earth anyway.\n\n01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000\nIt's not like I've got to make sure that Constitution\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000\nis upheld perfectly.\n\n01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000\nI don't give a fuck about you morons.\n\n01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000\nI'm not...\n\n01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nFuck you.\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000\nI'm just kidding.\n\n01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000\nI love you, but...\n\n01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000\nI was given a hard time during that werewolf game\n\n01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000\nby all of you.\n\n01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000\nAnd just like...\n\n01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000\nI don't want any of you to get shot,\n\n01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000\nbut I also don't care about your Constitution.\n\n01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000\nOkay, so...\n\n01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000\nWe're focused on this legislative issue.\n\n01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000\nWe're like...\n\n01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000\nObviously, if you are a person who's been saying\n\n01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000\nfor 30 years we need to mitigate this\n\n01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000\nlegislatively every time one of these things\n\n01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000\nhappens, obviously it's going to be\n\n01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000\nlike a big fucking rage-full\n\n01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000\nmoment, and obviously\n\n01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000\nif you're somebody that's always\n\n01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000\nworried that someone's going to come take their guns,\n\n01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000\nthen you're going to play the other part\n\n01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000\nand all this stuff.\n\n01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000\nBut just outside of that Heathcliff fight\n\n01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000\nwith the claws going around,\n\n01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000\nlike the...\n\n01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000\nThank you, Will Wheaton.\n\n01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000\nI love that image so much.\n\n01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000\nThe...\n\n01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000\nHashtag in our rage.\n\n01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000\nThe...\n\n01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000\nAre we going to...\n\n01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000\nWhat are we going to do?\n\n01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000\nWhat is step two in a hypothetical universe\n\n01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000\nwhere we would say to all...\n\n01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000\nThe guns are in circulation in the last 30 years.\n\n01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000\nLike, we're going to be all dead shot or not.\n\n01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000\nLike, we're all going to be dead before\n\n01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000\nlegislation would stop the insanity.\n\n01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000\nThere are more guns in America than there are\n\n01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000\npeople.\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000\nYeah, so...\n\n01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000\nSo is there another step to this?\n\n01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000\nOr are we...\n\n01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000\nNo, we're not ever going to do anything about it\n\n01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nbecause we sat by as a nation and allowed\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000\na classroom full of six-year-olds to be\n\n01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000\nmurdered and then would not\n\n01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000\neven at a legislative level\n\n01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000\ndo the most fucking useless\n\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nthing that could possibly have been\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nreasonably passed.\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000\nWe as a nation would know it's way more\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nimportant that we jerk off our guns\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000\nthan our kids go to school without ever\n\n01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nhaving to worry about dying.\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000\nI go into a movie theater and wonder,\n\n01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nwell, am I going to be another?

It's easily\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000\nlike just all you have to do is look at\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000\nthe numbers before Brownback was elected\n\n01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nand after.

which\n\n01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000\nyou mean you're on one?\n\n01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000\nyeah so it's in my head and they put\n\n01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000\ncoils in it and that's to\n\n01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000\nkind of deflate it\n\n01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000\nso that the blood can... is that something that's happened\n\n01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000\nsince we last

things okay sorry\n\n01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000\nso to backtrack\n\n01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000\nthe one thing I want to talk about was a\n\n01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000\nKickstarter project that you guys all helped me fund\n\n01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000\nand how important it's been\n\n01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000\nto my progress\n\n01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000\nbut to get there real quickly\n\n01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000\nback before I started the project\n\n01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000\nI was\n\n01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000\nI was kind of told around\n\n01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000\n2013 when I first was in a hospital in\n\n01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000\n2010 that the\n\n01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000\nsome of the procedures I went through\n\n01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000\nthey don't know the long term effects of them because they were new procedures\n\n01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000\nso we weren't sure\n\n01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000\nif I would survive past\n\n01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000\na couple years and so\n\n01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000\nI think subconsciously I was\n\n01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000\nready to go at any time\n\n01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000\nso I did\n\n01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000\nlike the book soul star and then we put it online\n\n01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000\nand we you know we're trying to\n\n01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000\nyou know get out there try to raise money for the aneurysm foundation\n\n01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000\nthe book didn't do well\n\n01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000\nso then I\n\n01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000\nfaced like my first\n\n01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000\nyou know failure in a way\n\n01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000\nand then as that kind of fed\n\n01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000\nit started to\n\n01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000\nwhere I was waking up like hey another day\n\n01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000\nyou know another day is another gift\n\n01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000\nand then I guess like most people\n\n01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000\nas you get older you get jaded and cynical\n\n01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000\nand I had to go from\n\n01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000\nbeing essentially an infant\n\n01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000\nwhen I had my aneurysm for not talking and not walking\n\n01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000\nand relearning all that\n\n01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000\nand then in the span of three years\n\n01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000\nget back into a 32 year old's body\n\n01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000\nso my life went hyper fast\n\n01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000\nso once I hit that wall\n\n01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000\nand things were going slow\n\n01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000\nreality really hit me and I wasn't really\n\n01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000\ncoping with things very well\n\n01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000\nso I tried to take my own life\n\n01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000\nthis has happened\n\n01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000\nyou really made that effort\n\n01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000\noh yeah I mean I had not a good\n\n01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000\neffort I just have I was on a lot\n\n01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000\nof pills at the time so I just took a bunch\n\n01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000\nof them and then the shitty part was\n\n01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000\nthat I obviously it didn't work\n\n01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000\nand the next day I woke up really\n\n01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000\nsick and my stomach and chest were hurting\n\n01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000\nand I didn't have the money to go to the hospital\n\n01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000\nso I had to just\n\n01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000\ntough out some of the pain\n\n01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000\nand then\n\n01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000\nafter that time is when I started\n\n01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000\ntalking to my mom again\n\n01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000\nand I figured well okay\n\n01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000\nnow I know what the bottom looks like\n\n01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000\nlet's try to\n\n01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000\nbuild from that let's try to see\n\n01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000\nwhere I can go\n\n01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000\nso I started becoming friends with my mom again\n\n01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000\nwhich was nice and then I got to see\n\n01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000\nher last Christmas for the first time in a while\n\n01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000\nand now she currently\n\n01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000\nhelps me hunt down Star Wars figures from the new movie\n\n01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000\nshe's like she's at Walmart\n\n01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000\nlike I'm at Walmart do you want one\n\n01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000\nbecause we're rednecks\n\n01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000\nand she\n\n01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000\nso then\n\n01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000\nwhat happened was I did this project that I honestly\n\n01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000\nthought no one would care about\n\n01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000\nand then you guys all funded it\n\n01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000\nin like a day\n\n01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000\nso I'm sorry I see you guys\n\n01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000\nI need to make get this clear\n\n01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000\nbecause the timeline of this is were you just catching\n\n01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000\nthis up because when you've talked\n\n01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000\nto us in the past you're like you had reforges\n\n01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000\nrelationship with your mom are you talking about this suicide attempt\n\n01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000\nthis isn't the thing that has happened\n\n01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000\nthat's new to listeners of our show\n\n01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000\nit's new to listeners of the show\n\n01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000\nbut I haven't told it on the show\n\n01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000\nbut it predates your reconciliation with your mom\n\n01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000\nand stuff like that\n\n01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000\nit was like last February\n\n01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000\nyeah last February\n\n01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000\nsorry I just wanted to make that clear\n\n01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000\njust because people like\n\n01:48:45.000 -->

01:48:59.000\nfucking\n\n01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000\nwhen did it happen you piece of shit\n\n01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000\nyou would Schrab\n\n01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000\nfucking\n\n01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000\nsorry\n\n01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000\nso\n\n01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000\nnow he's good cop\n\n01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000\nnow\n\n01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000\ninstead of bad person\n\n01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000\nit's his usual role\n\n01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000\nthat's okay Dan it's alright\n\n01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000\nso this project\n\n01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000\nI wanted to do you know I lost a lot of the\n\n01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000\nvisual and creative side of my brain\n\n01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000\nI used to I moved out here to want to be a comic\n\n01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000\nbook artist when I first moved out here\n\n01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000\nand then I lost a good chunk of that\n\n01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000\nso I started you know but I still want to\n\n01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000\nbe a storyteller so I started writing\n\n01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000\nand I thought well what if I did an art\n\n01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000\nbook like what would that look like\n\n01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000\nsomeone who can't\n\n01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000\ndoesn't know what an apple looks like unless he's looking at one\n\n01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000\nwhat does someone like that create\n\n01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000\nand then as I was going through it\n\n01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000\nsome\n\n01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000\nof my visual memory started to come back\n\n01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000\nand then I started remembering like my life\n\n01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000\nand then on top of the worst part\n\n01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000\nabout that was that I could also remember\n\n01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000\nthings like dreams and I couldn't\n\n01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000\ndifferentiate what was a dream and what was\n\n01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000\nwhat actually happened to me\n\n01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000\nbecause all the visuals were just coming\n\n01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000\nlike tidal wave after tidal wave\n\n01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000\nand so instead of letting that\n\n01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000\ncontinue to depress me\n\n01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000\nwhat I did was I put it into the book\n\n01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000\nso this book I created called Alon\n\n01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000\nVitao that you guys all help fund\n\n01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000\nthank you\n\n01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000\nit started off really small\n\n01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000\nbut then because you guys funded it so quickly\n\n01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000\nand we raised almost double what I\n\n01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000\nintended I wanted to make it
