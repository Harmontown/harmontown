00:17.000\nHarmontown the podcast starting now is the time.\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:22.000\nHarmontown is starting now it's starting now.\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:24.000\nHarmontown.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:25.000\nDamn.\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:26.000\nNailed it.\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:31.000\nHello everybody, welcome to Harmontown from the cozy confines of the\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:34.000\nStar Burns Box booth.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:37.000\nI'm sitting here with Steve Levy, Spencer Crittenden your Game Master.\n\n00:37.000 --> 00:39.000\nI'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:42.000\nLet's give it up for the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:45.000\nAlright, thanks for joining us.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:53.000\nAlright, top item I think for those of our, you know, for anybody who's been like an avid listener\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:55.000\nas of the last month or so.\n\n00:55.000 --> 01:00.000\nA couple of weeks ago, I don't remember how long ago, we were talking about an\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:02.000\nencounter you had with Ron Jeremy.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:04.000\nYes.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:07.000\nAnd we, I forgot to address this last week.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:11.000\nLast week we had a gale time and they were like, there's whatever.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:14.000\nI'm not going to waste time talking about the stuff I didn't get a chance to bring up.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:23.000\nBut so to recap the story is that Jeff was at a party and Ron Jeremy walked by him and had a\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:25.000\nbanana peel on his shoulder.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:26.000\nYes.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:29.000\nAnd said, and Jeff said, you got a banana peel on your shoulder.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:31.000\nAnd Ron Jeremy was like, I know, and walked out.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:33.000\nSo we spent like 20 minutes speculating.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:34.000\nYes.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:37.000\nLike why would, what's the explanation for that?\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:43.000\nOur first guess collectively, I think, like that we were all very satisfied with was,\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:48.000\noh, he walks around with a banana peel on his shoulder because there's some gross kind\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:53.000\nof like banana in your window that he does for the ladies.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:55.000\nAnd Jeff's not like a pretty lady.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:57.000\nSo like he, he wasn't worth it.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:00.000\nSo I got the truth becomes fascinating.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:07.000\nSo somebody on Reddit or somebody sent an AMA or somebody wants to hit like you sent me a\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:11.000\nthing that somebody went to Ron Jeremy's Reddit page.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.000\nThis is the beauty of the internet.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:17.000\nAnd let's put a pin in a very temporary pin because I do want to talk about this too.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nIt's like, how do we feel about what this guy did?\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:22.000\nBecause it's like, it's sort of like that's the internet for you.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:29.000\nLike somebody just blatantly, just bluntly messaged Ron Jeremy and said, Jeff Davis on\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:33.000\nHarmontown said you had an encounter with him and that you seemed mad at him when you're\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:34.000\nasking about it.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:39.000\nBut you know, it's like, like no, no story is, is it just, it makes you cringe in the\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:40.000\nretelling.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:43.000\nLike a Larry King reading Eminem lyrics.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.000\nYou know, it's like, I didn't mean it that way.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:49.000\nBut this kid says to Ron Jeremy, this happened.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:50.000\nWhat do you have to say?\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:53.000\nRon Jeremy responds.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:56.000\nIt makes me more appealing.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:57.000\nRight.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:02.000\nSo it was our theory was correct except for one fascinating detail, which is that it\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:03.000\nwasn't pornographic.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:05.000\nIt doesn't have to be though.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:07.000\nIf you're Ron Jeremy, everything you do is pornographic.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:08.000\nExactly.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:15.000\nSo he had this cutesy like, like Richard scary Mr. Rogers kind of connect.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:17.000\nSo we were essentially right.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:18.000\nYeah.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:19.000\nYeah.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:20.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:27.000\nIs his built in joke or admission in that like, I'm not an appealing person.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:30.000\nLike I am not an attractive gentleman.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:31.000\nI'm not.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:34.000\nAnd so I'm going to get out in front of that.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:36.000\nI never even thought about it that way.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:39.000\nI called myself ugly before you did.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:40.000\nI haven't.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:46.000\nI'm more appealing than you, than you, you know, now because I have trash on my shoulder.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:51.000\nSo I will say, yeah, remember when we talked about that, how I took a big long chunk aside\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:54.000\nbecause I was like, I love my porn.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nI love my monsters.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:58.000\nI love my underground people.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:05.000\nI hate our societies like hypocritical treatment of, of what we're now calling sex workers.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:09.000\nBut, but, but, and I was like, you know, it's like, I don't, I think we have a very unhealthy\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:11.000\nrelationship with that stuff.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:15.000\nAnd like, I, every time I hear that Ron Jeremy was at a party and like so much, you know,\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:18.000\nsomeone will make some joke that's like, well, it kind of, you're talking about this person\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:21.000\nlike a second class citizen and stuff.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:26.000\nIt was all wasted effort because, you know, he now, now I can judge him.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:30.000\nHe put a banana peel on his shoulder and the answer was something cute.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:32.000\nHe could have just used it on you.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\nHe could have just said, it makes me more appealing to you.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\nAnd he, but he didn't.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:41.000\nAnd now I like, I'm a little mad at him.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:44.000\nWait, church, you had a banana before.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:45.000\nDo we ever talk about this?\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:46.000\nYeah.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.000\nThere was bananas involved, but we took them off the table.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:49.000\nYeah.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:50.000\nYeah.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:51.000\nYeah.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:52.000\nI don't know.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:58.000\nIt's like the person that does that, that goes on Reddit and says, hey, he didn't, he\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:03.000\nor she did not say, hey, Jeff Davis from Harmontown just said Jeff Davis, like that\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nmatters to Ron Jeremy.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:06.000\nOkay.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:10.000\nSo Jeff Davis said that you, well, the banana peel and you, you're all pissed off about it.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nI don't get the instinct of that person.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:16.000\nIs that, is that someone trying to prove that I made up a story?\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:17.000\nThat, yeah.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:18.000\nOkay.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:19.000\nYeah.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nI want to talk about that too because do we love that person or hate that person?\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:22.000\nI don't know.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:26.000\nI mean, because there was another time and because now someone also, by the way, not to\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:28.000\ninterject is going to now.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:29.000\nOkay.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:31.000\nNow we're talking about it and it's interesting that we're talking about it.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:38.000\nNow, now, now two more people will, will message him and go, you have a beef on this\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:39.000\nthing and something.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nIt's a, it's a stupid instinct by stupid people like that.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nHowever, it got us an answer.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:47.000\nBut, well, but then again, he doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nWho's Jeff Davis?\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nHe probably was a banana peel around all the goddamn time.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nHe didn't know why he had a banana peel on his shoulder.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:55.000\nHe was also engaged in fucking cryptography.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:56.000\nYeah.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nRemember a long, long time ago.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:05.000\nIt took a troll to get to the, to hack and leak the rope, Jeremy leaks.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:09.000\nIn the early, I think the first time I ever even heard of Reddit, I told a story about\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:13.000\nthe neurologist that I worked with who did this crazy thing and somebody went online,\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nasked her, did this happen?\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:19.000\nJeff Davis said that you did this thing and she wrote back, I don't know what you're talking\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:20.000\nabout.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:24.000\nNow either she doesn't remember what, what, what, that she doesn't remember that moment\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:27.000\nin the way that I and other people in that room remembered that moment.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nWait, can you rewind that a little bit because I don't.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:33.000\nI did a pilot with a woman who is a neurologist from Boston General.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:34.000\nOh.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:39.000\nAnd we were doing a pilot and it's based on her and there was an actor who was trying to.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:42.000\nOkay, you had a story and somebody during her AMA, okay.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:45.000\nWent, no, no, no emailed her, tracked her down.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nThis is pre AMAs.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:51.000\nLike at least as far as this doctor is concerned, someone just tracked her down and said, hey,\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:54.000\nthis guy, Jeff Davis, the show with you said this thing happened.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:55.000\nBullshit, right?\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:57.000\nAnd she's like, I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:00.000\nI think he's probably like combining this story and that story.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nThe thing is, I remember what happened.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:07.000\nAnd also there's, there's five or six people I could track down to absolutely back that\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:11.000\nup, but she's not going to go online and say, oh yeah, I'm a crazy person.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:14.000\nLike the story is about her being a crazy genius.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:18.000\nEven she didn't remember it because she didn't because she's got bigger fish to fry because\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:22.000\nshe's a neurologist and heals people for a living.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:27.000\nOr she doesn't want to go out on record saying, oh yeah, I see dead people.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nLike I have crazy superpowers.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:30.000\nRight.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:35.000\nBecause she already got like decommissioned ones and had to get locked up for it.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:40.000\nSo the fact that somebody goes out there and tries to debunk this story.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:48.000\nWell, okay, but that's, so like this person that approached Ron Jeremy digitally, you\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:58.000\nknow, I, it's a, it boils down to like, oh, we wish that they had taken the time to like\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nbe more nuanced in their language.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nBut really what they were doing was not debunking.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nI don't think that they were.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:05.000\nI think for that.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:06.000\nYou're using an example.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:11.000\nI get it because like you're saying somebody like fucking actually, you told an interesting\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:15.000\nstory and somebody was like, yeah, but did that ever happen and like ask somebody else?\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:19.000\nFor instance, like one of the first times I went on Reddit was I told the story about\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:23.000\nmy understudy and the king and I getting slapped the shit out of by Gil Brenner.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nNow that's a fucking actual story.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:30.000\nBut I went on Reddit like I'm like an idiot, which you really must not do because it's\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\na dent of sadness.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:36.000\nAnd I, I went on there and feel like that didn't fucking happen.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:40.000\nI'm like, dude, I can't even tell my good stories on the air because it's too fucking,\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nthey're too scandalous.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nLike I was there.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\nIt's a real story, but people think I'm full of shit.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:50.000\nNow, have I exaggerated in the past or maybe fucked up a detail or two?\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:51.000\nOf course.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:56.000\nBut the thing is, I don't, when I saw the Ron Jeremy thing, I was like, is it, is that\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nsomebody trying to zing me?\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:04.000\nYeah, I would categorize that person as what they actually, I think they were kind of,\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nI think they believed the story.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:09.000\nAnd they're fans of us and Ron Jeremy.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.000\nThey're fans of us and maybe not so much Ron Jeremy.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:16.000\nThat's the minor problem I have with that person.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:23.000\nIt's just, it was just like, well, and look, I'm, do as I, like, I'm, that person, like,\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:27.000\nthey're not a, to me, they're not a villain because it's like,\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:31.000\nI didn't see villainy in that person doing, I think they were saying like, oh, like,\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:32.000\nI'm on the internet.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:35.000\nI get to ask Ron Jeremy about Harmontown.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:40.000\nAnd we would prefer to have so much control over the universe that the way Ron Jeremy hears\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:47.000\nabout that interaction wouldn't come through like a channel that removes all the empathy.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:52.000\nBecause if Ron Jeremy walked in here off the street, we would be nice to him and we would\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:56.000\nask him what the hell was going on with the banana peel and there would be humanity involved.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:59.000\nIf he came in here right now, I would ask him about that.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:04.000\nAnd I tend to think that it's not a thing he does a lot.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:09.000\nI don't think that was a, that's a, that's a costume he wears all the time around town.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nHe puts a banana peel on the shoulder.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nI think he was probably doing some sort of riff.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:18.000\nHe had a banana peel, put it on his shoulder, did a funny joke to somebody left it there.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nBut I was a guy, not a girl.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nI mean, I just think it was a momentary thing.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:27.000\nI really don't think Ron Jeremy walks around occasionally or frequently.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:28.000\nI'm squinting at you.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:29.000\nYou are.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:33.000\nSubscribers can see if you choose to pay us $5 a month to watch the podcast.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:34.000\nYou can see that I'm squinting at you.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nDan, nobody's subscribing anymore.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:37.000\nThey'll stop listening when we stop having.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nWell, I'm trying, I'm trying to change that by squinting at you.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:40.000\nOkay, well.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nSo I'm trying to add an element to the podcast that requires $5.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:45.000\nShould I just book Ron Jeremy and get to the bottom of this?\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:46.000\nSure.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:47.000\nI know.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:51.000\nFor $5 a month, you could see Dan casting me a jaundiced eye.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:55.000\nOnly because in your defense, kind of, I guess.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:58.000\nI think I'm just giving him the big benefit of the doubt.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:03.000\nHis response to that kid saying, what's that story about being like one line?\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nIt makes me more appealing.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nIt felt a little confident.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:11.000\nBut here's the thing.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nRon Jeremy and I do not share.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nWe're not cousins on the spectrum.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:21.000\nSo I guess I can't compare his behavior to mine in that situation because I would have\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:27.000\nbeen like, my response would have been eight paragraphs long had that been like a, I would\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nhave gone, okay, here's the thing.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:33.000\nThere was a banana peel on the table and I started to put it and I started doing this\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:36.000\njoke and then I was like, I was walking around with it and I wanted to go and I didn't want\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nto take it off and then put it back on.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:41.000\nI would have all this fucking like, or I would go like, you know what?\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:44.000\nI was horny that night and I was like doing this thing and it was getting some action.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:49.000\nAnd then I was like tired and I don't remember your friend, whoever you're talking about,\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:50.000\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:56.000\nIt would have been a hyperverbal response, which by the way, how does that get me more\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nresults than Ron Jeremy is getting?\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:01.000\nI guess the only thing I have nothing to do.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:07.000\nBecause all I did was harmlessly ask a Ron Jeremy that was four feet away from me who\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:12.000\njust passed me wearing a banana, a spent banana peel over his shoulder.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:16.000\nI said, pardon me, sir, you have a banana peel on your shoulder.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:22.000\nAnd the only reaction that is confusing is him to go, yeah, thanks.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:26.000\nIt's funny because it's not funny in the moment.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:31.000\nThat's why it's funny because it's like, you could have just said it makes me more appealing\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:35.000\nand I think maybe I think that's him.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:40.000\nBecause if I were a cute girl, he might have gone, well, does it make me more appealing\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:41.000\nand then what?\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:49.000\nWell, also, if you're a guy, as you are, and you go, excuse me, you got a banana peel\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:53.000\non your shoulder and if he stopped and said, it makes me more appealing, you might have\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:54.000\ngone gross.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nIs that how you get laid?\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:57.000\nFuck.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nMy dick's bigger than yours.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nWhat are you trying to pull?\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:04.000\nIt would have been vulnerable.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nI would never have gone that far.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nI know you wouldn't have.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\nThe phantom of his father might have gone that far.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:11.000\nLet's role play.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:14.000\nWho do I get to be?\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:15.000\nNo wrong answers.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:18.000\nYou're on Jeremy, but give me the reply that he did, like respond.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:24.000\nNo, no, give me, it makes me more appealing, like do the fun version of that.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nSir, you have a banana peel on your shoulder.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nIt makes me more appealing.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nOh, you little devil.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nThat would have been my response.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:37.000\nYeah, thank you because a guy outside the bathroom, I said that and he made fun of me.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:40.000\nHe said, you think that's funny?\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:45.000\nYou're a piece of shit and then he said some horrible shit about a movie I was in in 1972\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:48.000\nand then he made fun of my body, which is always on display in my work.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:50.000\nI got this half bottle of champagne.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nYou want some?\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:52.000\nAre you sticking around?\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:53.000\nI'd love some.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:54.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:55.000\nI'm Ron Jeremy.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nI'm Jeff.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nIt's nice to meet you.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:58.000\nThank you.\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\nYou know what?\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nI get scared of being vulnerable with people because I'm a public figure and it's really\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\neasy to make fun of me.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nYou know, but here's the beauty of you wearing a banana peel on your shoulder.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:06.000\nFor me, if you just walked by, I wouldn't have said anything.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:10.000\nI would have said to my girlfriend, oh shit, Ron Jeremy just walked by.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:16.000\nBut because you had a gimmick or whether you're doing a bit or like a thing or whatever,\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:22.000\nlike I got to say something to Ron Jeremy because there was a specific thing happening.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:25.000\nAnd you're saying it kind of in a literal sense made me more appealing.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nWell, it made you more accessible.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:28.000\nRight.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:29.000\nIt didn't make me more appealing.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:32.000\nThat's my concern was that I did it for...\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nCan I ask you a question?\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nWho's your champagne?\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nOh, thank you.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.000\nCheers.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nYeah.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:40.000\nClink.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:46.000\nI say clink because we're drinking out of paper cups, but that's me being less appealing.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:47.000\nI don't know.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:51.000\nCan I ask you three questions about the banana peel?\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:52.000\nI trust you.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:53.000\nYeah.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:54.000\nOkay.\n\n14:54.000 --> 15:00.000\nWhat's the origin story of that banana peel being on your right shoulder?\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nMy uncle Kurt used to do it.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:07.000\nI love uncle Kurt.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:14.000\nAnd he was actually in our family, like the running joke was that he had a really, really\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:15.000\nsmall penis.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:18.000\nI grew up in a very liberal family.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:22.000\nI was a child of the 40s.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:30.000\nYou know, back then there was a counterculture that wasn't as publicized as in the 60s, but\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:34.000\nI grew up on a ranch surrounded by hippies and things.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:35.000\nI'll stop you.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.000\nI've read your biography.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:37.000\nOh, okay.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:38.000\nAll right.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:39.000\nOh, you've...\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nI've never heard the Kurt story.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nI know your whole childhood.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:46.000\nWell, he's one of the few family members that actually...\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:51.000\nYeah, he passed away before he could approve of the biography, but everyone else I checked\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:52.000\nit out with.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:53.000\nThat's very thoughtful of you.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nA lot of people don't even consider it.\n\n15:55.000 --> 16:01.120\nUncle Kurt was, yeah, the smallest penis, but the thing that always moved me about him\n\n16:01.120 --> 16:04.440\nwas that he...\n\n16:04.440 --> 16:07.600\nEveryone liked him more.\n\n16:07.600 --> 16:09.600\nAnd I always...\n\n16:09.600 --> 16:11.600\nBecause he had a banana peel on his shoulder?\n\n16:11.600 --> 16:13.560\nNo, because he did clever things like that.\n\n16:13.560 --> 16:16.320\nThat was something that stuck out in my head when I was eight years old.\n\n16:16.320 --> 16:20.600\nThe thing that stuck out in general about uncle Kurt was that he had this very tiny little\n\n16:20.600 --> 16:22.640\nitty-bitty little wiener.\n\n16:22.640 --> 16:28.600\nAnd I don't know if it was because of that, that he was such a socially graceful person,\n\n16:28.600 --> 16:32.920\nor I don't know how much of it had to do with the fact that, frankly, from the age of three\n\n16:32.920 --> 16:39.000\nforward, my earliest memories as Ron Jeremy are people telling me I had a huge, weirdly\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:40.000\nhuge dick.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:44.720\nLike, even before I knew what sex was, people were commenting about my big, giant dick.\n\n16:44.720 --> 16:49.240\nNow, is uncle Kurt wearing the banana peel because of his small dick?\n\n16:49.240 --> 16:51.160\nIs there a correlation there?\n\n16:51.160 --> 16:56.400\nNo, I mean, for me, what I'm saying to you is, it was a thing that he would do, and when\n\n16:56.400 --> 16:59.520\nI went to that party that night, there was bananas everywhere.\n\n16:59.520 --> 17:03.680\nThere were, because I saw people, yeah, peaches had a banana, which is already funny.\n\n17:03.680 --> 17:07.360\nIt was one of a million things that he would do, and I just kind of started doing it, and\n\n17:07.360 --> 17:11.640\nI actually immediately started getting results, and it was really satisfying to me.\n\n17:11.640 --> 17:19.000\nAnd the moment when you interacted with me, I was actually starting to come down from\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:27.800\nit because I had said just before I ran into you to a younger woman, you know, it makes\n\n17:27.800 --> 17:28.800\nme more appealing.\n\n17:28.800 --> 17:30.360\nShe's like, that's funny.\n\n17:30.360 --> 17:32.920\nLike people say you're a porn star.\n\n17:32.920 --> 17:35.760\nShe was so young, she didn't know, and I was like, yeah, I'm a porn star, but I'm also\n\n17:35.760 --> 17:36.760\na human being.\n\n17:36.760 --> 17:39.200\nAnd she was like, yeah, but why?\n\n17:39.200 --> 17:43.480\nIt went south really fast in a way that made me think that if I had been born with a smaller\n\n17:43.480 --> 17:47.680\ndick, at that moment, I might have met the woman of my dreams because I was overhearing\n\n17:47.680 --> 17:54.680\nher at the table by the champagne, and I was like, I love this girl, and I felt like I\n\n17:54.680 --> 18:01.160\nwas locked in a box from birth by my giant cock, and the banana peel couldn't break me\n\n18:01.160 --> 18:02.160\nout of it.\n\n18:02.160 --> 18:06.800\nAnd then I walked past you, and you said, and honestly, I don't remember the encounter,\n\n18:06.800 --> 18:08.240\nbut I'm telling you why that probably happened.\n\n18:08.240 --> 18:11.800\nI was on my way to my car, I didn't want to pull the banana peel off, because it would\n\n18:11.800 --> 18:16.520\nlook like a defeat, but I was just on my way to my car, and I just wanted to go home and\n\n18:16.520 --> 18:19.480\nlike just where I where I gained strength in isolation.\n\n18:19.480 --> 18:21.680\nBut when I asked you, you said, oh, it's making me more appealing.\n\n18:21.680 --> 18:23.920\nThis is not the version where you where you snapped it.\n\n18:23.920 --> 18:25.920\nLike, do you do you sometimes snap it?\n\n18:25.920 --> 18:26.920\nOh, oh, shit.\n\n18:26.920 --> 18:27.920\nYeah, I'm sorry.\n\n18:27.920 --> 18:28.920\nI forgot.\n\n18:28.920 --> 18:29.920\nNo, I have.\n\n18:29.920 --> 18:30.920\nSorry.\n\n18:30.920 --> 18:33.720\nWait, so now you're saying that sometimes I snap it people.\n\n18:33.720 --> 18:35.920\nThis is something that you do frequently.\n\n18:35.920 --> 18:36.920\nOkay.\n\n18:36.920 --> 18:43.480\nNow, if you're doing it frequently, what's what's the what's the blue sky version of\n\n18:43.480 --> 18:45.200\nlike only women asking you about it?\n\n18:45.200 --> 18:46.200\nLike what?\n\n18:46.200 --> 18:47.200\nI was caught up in a moment.\n\n18:47.200 --> 18:48.200\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n18:48.200 --> 18:49.200\nIt's not a thing that I do.\n\n18:49.200 --> 18:50.200\nIt's not my gimmick.\n\n18:50.200 --> 18:54.080\nIt was something that I started doing that I am familiar with that I got into Spencer.\n\n18:54.080 --> 19:00.640\nWhat's your take on the banana gate?\n\n19:00.640 --> 19:01.640\nWhat?\n\n19:01.640 --> 19:02.640\nYeah.\n\n19:02.640 --> 19:03.640\nI had a I could have.\n\n19:03.640 --> 19:04.640\nI could have.\n\n19:04.640 --> 19:05.640\nI could have.\n\n19:05.640 --> 19:09.000\nI could have put that in an envelope and what's your what's my take on?\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:10.960\nI don't think that sentence finished.\n\n19:10.960 --> 19:18.600\nWell, what do you think the backstory of the Ron Jeremy banana peel shoulder thing is?\n\n19:18.600 --> 19:20.000\nIs that a one off?\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.040\nIs that a thing he does?\n\n19:22.040 --> 19:27.800\nAnd why was he so I mean, he wasn't pissed off at me.\n\n19:27.800 --> 19:30.960\nHe just I think you guys got the to the answers already.\n\n19:30.960 --> 19:32.480\nI think he's done it a few times.\n\n19:32.480 --> 19:36.800\nI think he doesn't get anything about it by playing along with a male.\n\n19:36.800 --> 19:41.440\nI hope it's not the fact that he's trying to get out in front of you calling him an\n\n19:41.440 --> 19:46.640\nugly because the banana peel I think that's no, I don't I don't think I think that's\n\n19:46.640 --> 19:48.200\nyou reading too far into it.\n\n19:48.200 --> 19:50.160\nI think that anyone can be more appealing.\n\n19:50.160 --> 19:54.400\nThey don't have to necessarily think they're disgusting to have to say, oh, I could be\n\n19:54.400 --> 19:55.400\nmore appealing.\n\n19:55.400 --> 19:57.760\nBut did he like he could have had a bad night?\n\n19:57.760 --> 20:02.960\nI was like, I see stuff retweeted that I've said to some kid that I had an encounter with\n\n20:02.960 --> 20:04.280\nand I'm like, well, that's not me.\n\n20:04.280 --> 20:05.560\nI hope that doesn't represent me.\n\n20:05.560 --> 20:10.800\nHe is having a bad night, but I mean, we can't assume that he has a trunk of banana peels\n\n20:10.800 --> 20:11.800\nin his car.\n\n20:11.800 --> 20:12.800\nYeah.\n\n20:12.800 --> 20:14.920\nNo, it's like a bar trick.\n\n20:14.920 --> 20:17.360\nWasn't there a crazy Cody story you wanted to tell?\n\n20:17.360 --> 20:20.160\nWhat are you, my publicist?\n\n20:20.160 --> 20:21.160\nYeah.\n\n20:21.160 --> 20:22.760\nWell, you kind of are.\n\n20:22.760 --> 20:23.760\nYeah.\n\n20:23.760 --> 20:24.760\nYeah.\n\n20:24.760 --> 20:25.760\nWell, okay.\n\n20:25.760 --> 20:26.760\nThis is yes.\n\n20:26.760 --> 20:29.360\nYou told me to remind you last week because you didn't get to it.\n\n20:29.360 --> 20:31.000\nI told you to remind me.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nYeah, you're like, I want to talk about that on the podcast.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:34.000\nThat doesn't sound like me.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:38.880\nYeah, you'd remember something like that.\n\n20:38.880 --> 20:41.360\nI do have, yes, it's written down here.\n\n20:41.360 --> 20:42.960\nI didn't need that.\n\n20:42.960 --> 20:44.200\nThat's what's important.\n\n20:44.200 --> 20:45.200\nOkay.\n\n20:45.200 --> 20:48.720\nThank you.\n\n20:48.720 --> 20:50.720\nHere's the thing.\n\n20:50.720 --> 20:59.240\nI recently got a text message from a writer on Great Minds who I texted and said, am I,\n\n20:59.240 --> 21:00.960\ndo you want me to give you anonymity?\n\n21:00.960 --> 21:01.960\nHe doesn't care.\n\n21:01.960 --> 21:07.400\nBecause it's about, this is about marijuana, doesn't matter to him.\n\n21:07.400 --> 21:10.640\nBut Andrew Weinberg is writer on Great Minds, remember Andrew?\n\n21:10.640 --> 21:11.640\nYeah.\n\n21:11.640 --> 21:14.200\nHe was a guest on the show.\n\n21:14.200 --> 21:24.520\nHe texted me and said, I just came back from the weed store and this is the bag they gave\n\n21:24.520 --> 21:26.880\nme my weed in.\n\n21:26.880 --> 21:32.240\nAnd he texted me a photo of the bag that they gave to put his weed in when he left the weed\n\n21:32.240 --> 21:33.240\nstore.\n\n21:33.240 --> 21:42.800\nAnd on the bag was written, wait, why, am I distracted by, okay.\n\n21:42.800 --> 21:44.880\nWhat's in the bag?\n\n21:44.880 --> 21:45.960\nWhat's in the bag is a bunch of weed.\n\n21:45.960 --> 21:46.960\nWho cares?\n\n21:46.960 --> 21:47.960\nWhat's on the bag?\n\n21:47.960 --> 21:51.200\nWhat's on the bag is he takes me a photo of it.\n\n21:51.200 --> 21:58.680\nMy girlfriend, it says Cody Heller and her phone number with area code.\n\n21:58.680 --> 22:04.480\nHer address, her email address, everything.\n\n22:04.480 --> 22:13.160\nEvery conceivable thing you could learn about a human being without dumpster diving was about\n\n22:13.160 --> 22:18.960\nmy girlfriend was written on this paper bag that had been given his product in.\n\n22:18.960 --> 22:22.320\nAnd he was sending me a photo because he just happened to know, even though I wasn't going\n\n22:22.320 --> 22:25.360\nout with, or I guess I was going out with Cody during Great Minds.\n\n22:25.360 --> 22:34.360\nBut he, he's like, this is what they gave me and I'm like, oh, okay, so then one of\n\n22:34.360 --> 22:40.680\nthe phrases written on the bag was lamb's bread, which is a flavor of vape that Cody\n\n22:40.680 --> 22:41.680\nis obsessed with.\n\n22:41.680 --> 22:43.640\nShe loves lamb's bread.\n\n22:43.640 --> 22:45.200\nWhy is, what?\n\n22:45.200 --> 22:46.360\nObviously what happened.\n\n22:46.360 --> 22:56.400\nNot obviously, but a quick, you know, think tank session, put this together.\n\n22:56.400 --> 22:59.960\nThis is a dispensary that Cody had been on the phone with.\n\n22:59.960 --> 23:05.120\nShe, this lamb's bread flavor has been discontinued.\n\n23:05.120 --> 23:10.360\nI mean, she's, I really haven't seen anyone as obsessed about this stuff since like Justin\n\n23:10.360 --> 23:15.200\ntalked about like, I don't know, police academy action figures or something.\n\n23:15.200 --> 23:17.360\nLike, like, like she just had this obsession.\n\n23:17.360 --> 23:22.480\nLike she just, she found this vape flavor that she loves lamb's bread.\n\n23:22.480 --> 23:25.720\nIt was just, she was calling around to a lot of dispensaries.\n\n23:25.720 --> 23:30.320\nAnd then it was also, oh, also written on the bag was like, you can tell the story,\n\n23:30.320 --> 23:33.240\neven if you didn't have inside information, you could slowly figure it out because one\n\n23:33.240 --> 23:39.120\nof the things was something like willing to pay, willing to buy a thousand dollars worth\n\n23:39.120 --> 23:40.120\nor something.\n\n23:40.120 --> 23:41.360\nIt was like some form of that.\n\n23:41.360 --> 23:45.600\nSo Cody obviously called this place and was like, what's up with lamb's bread?\n\n23:45.600 --> 23:48.280\nI got to get more lamb's bread.\n\n23:48.280 --> 23:55.640\nMy name is Cody Heller here's, and they, and they're like, oh shit, let me use the,\n\n23:55.640 --> 24:01.160\nthe pot head equivalent of a database, which is writing on a bag next to the cash register\n\n24:01.160 --> 24:06.800\nall of your information because wow, that's a lot of, that's a lot of pot vape we could\n\n24:06.800 --> 24:07.800\nsell.\n\n24:07.800 --> 24:11.400\nIt happened that someone that you know went in and got that bag.\n\n24:11.400 --> 24:12.400\nIt just so happens.\n\n24:12.400 --> 24:13.400\nIt just so happens.\n\n24:13.400 --> 24:14.400\nThat's fucking nuts.\n\n24:14.400 --> 24:18.640\nWell, that's the, if Republicans are listening, it's like, okay, now you can use this as an\n\n24:18.640 --> 24:21.720\nexample of like, let's not legalize marijuana.\n\n24:21.720 --> 24:26.440\nHowever, I'm way ahead of you because it's like, no, let's legalize it so much that\n\n24:26.440 --> 24:32.440\nwe can have pay really high wages to people that have like super sophisticated computer\n\n24:32.440 --> 24:34.760\nsystems when they're selling you your pot.\n\n24:34.760 --> 24:39.480\nBut the punchline comes because I'm like, holy shit, my girlfriend was like inadvertently\n\n24:39.480 --> 24:51.360\ndoxxed by this, you know, trusted weed vendor and, um, fuck, I gotta the, and I was, I was\n\n24:51.360 --> 24:54.640\nexplained, I'm like, Jesus Christ, I'm trying to get to the bottom and I'm like, oh fuck,\n\n24:54.640 --> 24:56.280\nman, that's, that's crazy.\n\n24:56.280 --> 24:59.200\nLike if it hadn't been you, then there's just a stranger out there with all your personal\n\n24:59.200 --> 25:03.960\ninformation written on their weed bag and that's just, that's just bad form.\n\n25:03.960 --> 25:04.960\nYeah.\n\n25:04.960 --> 25:08.160\nBut, and then I'm like, oh, she's gonna be bummed out about this, but I have to tell\n\n25:08.160 --> 25:09.160\nher.\n\n25:09.160 --> 25:16.600\nUm, and, uh, and I, and I texted the photo and the story to Cody and her response, her\n\n25:16.600 --> 25:21.280\nimmediate first response was, oh no, if they don't have my info, I'm not gonna get my\n\n25:21.280 --> 25:22.280\nlamb's bread.\n\n25:22.280 --> 25:23.280\nHa, ha, ha.\n\n25:23.280 --> 25:24.280\nManant, manant, manant.\n\n25:24.280 --> 25:25.280\nWhat do you think?\n\n25:25.280 --> 25:26.280\nWhy is it called lamb's bread?\n\n25:26.280 --> 25:27.280\nYeah.\n\n25:27.280 --> 25:28.280\nWhat do you think lamb's bread is?\n\n25:28.280 --> 25:33.440\nIt's just a flavor of, no, I know, but like if, if I exist, well, once upon a time there\n\n25:33.440 --> 25:36.000\nwas a strain called God's breath.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:41.760\nI believe it might have been a relative to God's gift, but God's breath happened and\n\n25:41.760 --> 25:44.280\nit got changed to God's bread over time.\n\n25:44.280 --> 25:50.200\nIt kind of got bread into God's bread and then God's bread colloquially got renamed\n\n25:50.200 --> 25:54.000\nlamb's bread in some circles or was bread into lamb's bread.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:59.440\nSo it's, it's God's breath kind of bastardized three generations or so.\n\n25:59.440 --> 26:01.480\nI can't believe you actually know the answer to that.\n\n26:01.480 --> 26:04.600\nThe only reason I know you're not making it up is because you'd never put the energy\n\n26:04.600 --> 26:05.600\ninto it.\n\n26:05.600 --> 26:09.160\nLike you'd, you wouldn't, you wouldn't see the, you wouldn't see the point in lying,\n\n26:09.160 --> 26:10.160\nbut you could be lying.\n\n26:10.160 --> 26:11.480\nYou could be making all of that up.\n\n26:11.480 --> 26:12.480\nRight.\n\n26:12.480 --> 26:13.480\nWell, it's true.\n\n26:13.480 --> 26:21.000\nSpencer, like I've never seen you this nervous before because we'd learned earlier that Spencer's\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.800\nnew least Honda CRV.\n\n26:23.800 --> 26:27.400\nHe's already gone over his monthly allotment of miles for his lease.\n\n26:27.400 --> 26:28.400\nYeah.\n\n26:28.400 --> 26:35.000\nI got a new car and I had it for like a week and I got like a cheese stain in the car.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.400\nDon't worry about the cheese stain.\n\n26:37.400 --> 26:38.400\nWe're about to,\n\n26:38.400 --> 26:39.400\nWell, it's just,\n\n26:39.400 --> 26:40.400\nThat doesn't matter.\n\n26:40.400 --> 26:41.400\nDon't want to just\n\n26:41.400 --> 26:42.400\nFuck you guys.\n\n26:42.400 --> 26:43.400\nYou don't know what doesn't matter.\n\n26:43.400 --> 26:44.400\nYou're fine.\n\n26:44.400 --> 26:45.400\nEvery day it's like Macbeth.\n\n26:45.400 --> 26:50.040\nI'm going to fucking kill myself because I look in and see this faint grease stain in\n\n26:50.040 --> 26:53.000\nthe car that I know came from cheese.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:54.160\nWhat, what sort of cheese?\n\n26:54.160 --> 26:55.160\nWhat was the\n\n26:55.160 --> 26:56.160\nShatter cheese.\n\n26:56.160 --> 26:57.840\nFrom what kind of like meal were you having?\n\n26:57.840 --> 27:01.480\nA bag of cheddar cheese, I wasn't eating a bag of cheddar cheese, but it was from a bag\n\n27:01.480 --> 27:02.480\nof cheddar cheese.\n\n27:02.480 --> 27:03.480\nWas it melted cheese?\n\n27:03.480 --> 27:04.480\nNo.\n\n27:04.480 --> 27:05.480\nIt was just cheese.\n\n27:05.480 --> 27:06.480\nBut the oil got out.\n\n27:06.480 --> 27:07.480\nYeah.\n\n27:07.480 --> 27:08.480\nIt's a greasy item.\n\n27:08.480 --> 27:09.480\nGreasy cheese.\n\n27:09.480 --> 27:10.480\nRight.\n\n27:10.480 --> 27:11.480\nGreasy cheese.\n\n27:11.480 --> 27:14.120\nWhy did you have unwrapped cheese on your car seat?\n\n27:14.120 --> 27:16.560\nWell, I don't know how it got on the car seat.\n\n27:16.560 --> 27:24.040\nThey're multiple competing theories, including my favorite is Jeff put it on the car seat.\n\n27:24.040 --> 27:25.800\nThere's no reason to believe that that's true.\n\n27:25.800 --> 27:27.760\nBut have you calculated the worst case scenario?\n\n27:27.760 --> 27:31.800\nBecause what you're going through is like, you're, you're not to condescend to you because\n\n27:31.800 --> 27:37.360\nI'm lower than you on the consumer scale because you drive me everywhere.\n\n27:37.360 --> 27:42.160\nBut you're younger than me and I have bought cars, but not least them.\n\n27:42.160 --> 27:43.160\nI've bought you, whatever.\n\n27:43.160 --> 27:47.920\nI've, I've been through a lot of apartments and had my security deposit at stake because\n\n27:47.920 --> 27:52.720\nI hung up, hung up picture and oh no, there's a hole in the wall.\n\n27:52.720 --> 27:54.440\nThat shame that fills you.\n\n27:54.440 --> 27:58.720\nHave you, have you, have you gone to the point in confronting that shame where you've\n\n27:58.720 --> 28:03.400\ncalculated like the worst case scenario about leasing a Honda CRV and having a cheese stain\n\n28:03.400 --> 28:04.400\nbackseat?\n\n28:04.400 --> 28:06.960\nLike what's the worst that could happen to you?\n\n28:06.960 --> 28:11.400\nUh, I'd be on the hook for multiple thousands of dollars and I'd have a cheese stain in\n\n28:11.400 --> 28:12.400\nmy car.\n\n28:12.400 --> 28:16.680\nWell, what do you, but go through, I mean, what happens because if, if, if this is a\n\n28:16.680 --> 28:23.160\ncompany that, that leases you a car and tells you, by the way, we expect you to never cheese\n\n28:23.160 --> 28:24.160\nstain the seat.\n\n28:24.160 --> 28:25.720\nIt's not because of the lease.\n\n28:25.720 --> 28:27.040\nIt's because it's a new car.\n\n28:27.040 --> 28:30.320\nOh, are you just bummed out because you feel like you just got a new car and it's already\n\n28:30.320 --> 28:32.520\nstarting to look like your old car that you love?\n\n28:32.520 --> 28:34.360\nYeah, there's a giant fucking cheese stain.\n\n28:34.360 --> 28:39.040\nOh, well, then let's, let me shower you with fucking like, are you kidding me?\n\n28:39.040 --> 28:42.000\nThat's fucking like, that's fantastic.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:43.720\nThat's, that's Spencer juice.\n\n28:43.720 --> 28:44.720\nThat's, that's, that's.\n\n28:44.720 --> 28:45.720\nNo, that's why.\n\n28:45.720 --> 28:46.720\nIt's terrible.\n\n28:46.720 --> 28:47.720\nUh, because you're, yeah.\n\n28:47.720 --> 28:49.040\nNo, because it's cheese.\n\n28:49.040 --> 28:50.040\nI know, because.\n\n28:50.040 --> 28:54.400\nBut it's like, it might as well have been a D&D stain.\n\n28:54.400 --> 28:58.840\nHave you tried to get some, like, some shout or something like that and get it all out?\n\n28:58.840 --> 29:02.960\nI'm probably about $200 deep in trying to solve this problem.\n\n29:02.960 --> 29:03.960\nOh no.\n\n29:03.960 --> 29:04.960\nWhat kind of cheese?\n\n29:04.960 --> 29:05.960\nCheezus.\n\n29:05.960 --> 29:09.160\nIs it, is it $200 cheese stain?\n\n29:09.160 --> 29:15.120\nThis is a, I don't want to dismiss that road, but I was like, like, like also though, because\n\n29:15.120 --> 29:19.160\nI resonate with this, like, you're thinking like you got this new car and it's like, it's\n\n29:19.160 --> 29:20.600\nlike a grown-up car, right?\n\n29:20.600 --> 29:23.960\nLike you're like a child and you got like a grown-up car and you saw the cheese stain\n\n29:23.960 --> 29:26.920\nand you're like, oh, I'm already doing it wrong.\n\n29:26.920 --> 29:31.560\nLike I didn't, I didn't do what my mom would do or like what a grown-up does or like what\n\n29:31.560 --> 29:35.000\nyour favorite cop character on TV would do.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:36.000\nLike, like.\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:37.000\nRight.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:38.000\nAdam Sandberg.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.000\nBen Hitchcock.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.000\nAdam Sandberg.\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:44.320\nHe loves getting his name mixed up with Adam Sandler.\n\n29:44.320 --> 29:49.240\nAdam Sandberg's cop-cop car wouldn't have cheese stains, first of all, I doubt that.\n\n29:49.240 --> 29:52.680\nI'm sure if that's a lovable sick one, probably has some cheese stains.\n\n29:52.680 --> 29:53.680\nThis resonates with me.\n\n29:53.680 --> 30:00.200\nLike if I put myself in your shoes or your car, my OCD, I would never not notice the\n\n30:00.200 --> 30:01.200\ncheese stain.\n\n30:01.200 --> 30:02.200\nNo, I know.\n\n30:02.200 --> 30:05.080\nI can literally feel it in the back of my head when I'm driving.\n\n30:05.080 --> 30:08.000\nI can feel it behind me in the seat.\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:13.680\nLike I just, it's not my seat, like it's in the back seat, but I just, its presence is\n\n30:13.680 --> 30:15.320\nthere and undeniable.\n\n30:15.320 --> 30:18.880\nBut you pick me up for work every day and drive me everywhere and you-\n\n30:18.880 --> 30:23.280\nAnd I'm on the verge of killing us both because of this cheese stain.\n\n30:23.280 --> 30:27.840\nAnd I would accept that if you were to, if we got to heaven and you would say, I'm sorry\n\n30:27.840 --> 30:32.000\nman, I had a cheese stain and I had to, what was life worth and I was like, that's why\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:36.840\nyou swerved into oncoming traffic and I'd be like, you know what, better reason to die\n\n30:36.840 --> 30:44.560\nthan because we elected a dyslexic fucking stroked out, humonculus.\n\n30:44.560 --> 30:46.440\nHumonculus?\n\n30:46.440 --> 30:50.960\nI would say take the Honda back to the Honda dealership and say, look, I got this fucking\n\n30:50.960 --> 30:52.240\ncheese stain back here.\n\n30:52.240 --> 30:53.440\nIt's driving me crazy.\n\n30:53.440 --> 30:56.280\nDo you guys, they'll know how to get the cheese stain out.\n\n30:56.280 --> 30:57.280\nI've thought about that.\n\n30:57.280 --> 30:59.200\nI've taken it to get detailed, but-\n\n30:59.200 --> 31:04.120\nCan I be the other devil on your shoulder because there's no angel in this equation?\n\n31:04.120 --> 31:08.720\nCan I take another bag of cheese and fucking rub it all over that thing?\n\n31:08.720 --> 31:11.880\nOr not, that was, that's Dino if you would hear him.\n\n31:11.880 --> 31:18.720\nI'm saying like this, the solution isn't to avoid cheese stains because that creates\n\n31:18.720 --> 31:22.920\nan economy, a psychological economy where you're like, then you're always one cheese\n\n31:22.920 --> 31:25.960\nstain away from being deregulated.\n\n31:25.960 --> 31:31.920\nThe solution is to actually accept the cheese stain because then that helps you cope with\n\n31:31.920 --> 31:33.160\nlike reality.\n\n31:33.160 --> 31:37.000\nThe first time I leased a car, I obsessed about it so much and the first time I got\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:41.320\na little nick like somebody opened their door into my door and there's a little ding there,\n\n31:41.320 --> 31:43.680\nit drove me fucking crazy because I-\n\n31:43.680 --> 31:44.680\nI remember.\n\n31:44.680 --> 31:48.440\nI wanted that thing to be perfect and now like having leased a bunch of cars, you don't\n\n31:48.440 --> 31:49.440\ngive a shit.\n\n31:49.440 --> 31:50.440\nThey don't give a shit.\n\n31:50.440 --> 31:55.920\nWhen Jeff got his first Lexus, like, yeah, you weren't a dick or anything, but it was\n\n31:55.920 --> 31:56.920\nlike-\n\n31:56.920 --> 31:57.920\nNo, I was-\n\n31:57.920 --> 31:58.920\nIt fucking eclipsed his life.\n\n31:58.920 --> 31:59.920\nIt was like he had a-\n\n31:59.920 --> 32:03.840\nYeah, I only had shitty cars before that, I only had cars that were covered in cheese\n\n32:03.840 --> 32:04.840\nstains like the whole-\n\n32:04.840 --> 32:08.560\nAnd it wasn't because you became a materialist, it was because-\n\n32:08.560 --> 32:09.560\nI felt like an adult for the first time.\n\n32:09.560 --> 32:12.240\nIt was because you felt like you were fucking up adulting.\n\n32:12.240 --> 32:13.240\nYeah.\n\n32:13.240 --> 32:16.760\nI know exactly- that's first day of school for everybody.\n\n32:16.760 --> 32:20.680\nYou just get this big chance and you lay out your pants and your binders and all that\n\n32:20.680 --> 32:24.960\nstuff and then the first time it's like, oh, my homework's got bubble gum on it and then\n\n32:24.960 --> 32:29.600\nwe just go like, God fucking damn it, I knew it, I knew I'm a piece of shit, I knew it!\n\n32:29.600 --> 32:32.680\nYeah, you hear your mother's voice in your head yelling at you for fucking up.\n\n32:32.680 --> 32:38.560\nThat's why I'm mad, it's not because of any of- else, it's not like the practical struggles\n\n32:38.560 --> 32:42.000\nof a stain, like that's literally the only reason why I'm mad.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:47.160\nThat's what I want to address to help you feel better because first step that makes\n\n32:47.160 --> 32:51.080\nyou 90% feel better is talking about it because as soon as it comes out of your mouth you\n\n32:51.080 --> 32:59.200\nknow it's like- and then the next 10% is us going like, yeah, man, me too, me too.\n\n32:59.200 --> 33:02.640\nI was pretty impressed that you had a new car until I found out it's the fucking cheese\n\n33:02.640 --> 33:03.640\nstain car.\n\n33:03.640 --> 33:05.640\nI know.\n\n33:05.640 --> 33:08.760\nOutside of the cheese stain though, how do you like that car?\n\n33:08.760 --> 33:09.760\nIt's fine.\n\n33:09.760 --> 33:11.720\nHe likes it so much, he's going over his miles!\n\n33:11.720 --> 33:18.560\nOh man, it's the mileage- the idea of a mileage cap bummed me out.\n\n33:18.560 --> 33:27.160\nI haven't had a car since it gave my Prius to McGathey and the divorce and I don't need\n\n33:27.160 --> 33:28.800\nto drive anywhere apparently.\n\n33:28.800 --> 33:29.800\nI found that out.\n\n33:29.800 --> 33:34.320\nWell, Spencer does and he's going to kill himself.\n\n33:34.320 --> 33:39.560\nDo you get sick of me- are you looking forward to me not needing a ride everywhere?\n\n33:39.560 --> 33:46.360\nI think that the scheduled demands that sometimes arise from the worst case scenarios of having\n\n33:46.360 --> 33:52.720\nto drive you around can be a hassle, but the actual driving of you around is not a hassle.\n\n33:52.720 --> 33:57.040\nThat's all fine and good, but sometimes it's like, well, it means I got to get up and leave\n\n33:57.040 --> 34:02.840\nthe house at eight and then I might be on the hook until eight or something at night.\n\n34:02.840 --> 34:07.200\nThat's where the problems come in, but especially lately that's never been the case.\n\n34:07.200 --> 34:09.560\nWe've been really easy going lately.\n\n34:09.560 --> 34:16.440\nI am looking forward to- well, because also in my own personal schedule I've made a decision\n\n34:16.440 --> 34:20.120\nthat I'm like, I'm going to pull back and take it easy with the workaholism a little\n\n34:20.120 --> 34:21.120\nbit.\n\n34:21.120 --> 34:24.960\nThat probably affects it a little, where I'm like, I don't mind.\n\n34:24.960 --> 34:30.880\nWe also have been- by the way, for those of you who joined us in the beginning, and we\n\n34:30.880 --> 34:38.360\nhaven't explained it, Jeff and Church are doing a hands-made tail cosplay.\n\n34:38.360 --> 34:43.160\nWe explained that while the audio was out and then Jeff- Jeff had come in and sat down\n\n34:43.160 --> 34:49.320\nand for the last 30 minutes, Jeff has been with a completely straight face just being\n\n34:49.320 --> 34:55.880\nJeff and he has this fucking ridiculous beard.\n\n34:55.880 --> 34:58.600\nIt's pretty funny, but that's- I mean, my beard is itchy because it's fake and I've\n\n34:58.600 --> 35:04.240\ngot spirit gum on, there's mesh, but how do you guys- you guys all have beards.\n\n35:04.240 --> 35:05.240\nIt's terrible.\n\n35:05.240 --> 35:08.560\nYou're wearing a big old thing on your face all the time, it's like I want to blow my\n\n35:08.560 --> 35:09.560\nbrains out.\n\n35:09.560 --> 35:10.560\nMy grandmother hit me too.\n\n35:10.560 --> 35:11.560\nShe yells at me.\n\n35:11.560 --> 35:12.560\nOh yeah?\n\n35:12.560 --> 35:13.560\nOh yeah.\n\n35:13.560 --> 35:16.080\nWait, wait, because- Because kissing you is less essential?\n\n35:16.080 --> 35:17.080\nNo.\n\n35:17.080 --> 35:22.320\nBecause men with beards are inherently less handsome.\n\n35:22.320 --> 35:23.800\nIt's like an old way of thinking.\n\n35:23.800 --> 35:25.000\nShe's like, you guys are gross.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:29.600\nDid you tell her that old women are less attractive?\n\n35:29.600 --> 35:30.600\nNo.\n\n35:30.600 --> 35:31.600\nNo.\n\n35:31.600 --> 35:33.720\nWell, then that's called privilege.\n\n35:33.720 --> 35:35.440\nYou could just kick back and enjoy it.\n\n35:35.440 --> 35:40.320\nShe's like, yeah, grandma, you got it, I'm a real ugly piece of shit.\n\n35:40.320 --> 35:42.520\nWank-wank to God.\n\n35:42.520 --> 35:43.520\nEvery other-\n\n35:43.520 --> 35:49.960\nYour paper flesh isn't gross at all, no one has a right to shame you for that because\n\n35:49.960 --> 35:52.560\nit's not a choice, you're just melting.\n\n35:52.560 --> 35:57.600\nShe's being old school because Jewish Paul Newman wouldn't have a beard.\n\n35:57.600 --> 35:58.600\nI'm sorry, I-\n\n35:58.600 --> 35:59.920\nPaul Newman was Jewish.\n\n35:59.920 --> 36:04.360\nYeah, but you're like the Jewish Paul Newman.\n\n36:04.360 --> 36:09.120\nPaul Newman could never be as Jewish as you, no matter how hard he tried.\n\n36:09.120 --> 36:13.360\nI don't think he went to temple as much as you did.\n\n36:13.360 --> 36:16.160\nHe goes, he probably went to temple more than me.\n\n36:16.160 --> 36:17.760\nDid you love your grandma?\n\n36:17.760 --> 36:18.760\nYeah, she's great.\n\n36:18.760 --> 36:21.480\nDo you think she's an attractive person?\n\n36:21.480 --> 36:23.360\nLike, physically?\n\n36:23.360 --> 36:25.360\nYeah, she went there.\n\n36:25.360 --> 36:26.360\nOh, come on.\n\n36:26.360 --> 36:27.360\nOkay.\n\n36:27.360 --> 36:28.360\nDon't do that to me.\n\n36:28.360 --> 36:29.360\nNo.\n\n36:29.360 --> 36:30.360\nDon't do that to her.\n\n36:30.360 --> 36:31.360\nDon't do that to you.\n\n36:31.360 --> 36:34.920\nHow about we live in a society where reason is God and rule of law governs the land.\n\n36:34.920 --> 36:35.920\nShe wants me to get-\n\n36:35.920 --> 36:39.080\nAnd we don't judge people by whether they're like, why are grandma's grandfathered in?\n\n36:39.080 --> 36:41.080\nWell, that's because they're grandmas.\n\n36:41.080 --> 36:44.080\nIt's like, oh, you're so cute.\n\n36:44.080 --> 36:45.080\nYou know what?\n\n36:45.080 --> 36:48.880\nI wonder how much of the fucking patriarch is upheld by grandmas who are like, oh, you're\n\n36:48.880 --> 36:49.880\nso attractive.\n\n36:49.880 --> 36:50.880\nAll of it.\n\n36:50.880 --> 36:51.880\nWhen are you going to get married?\n\n36:51.880 --> 36:52.880\nWhen are you going to look better?\n\n36:52.880 --> 36:54.360\nWhy don't you show some leg?\n\n36:54.360 --> 36:56.480\nGrandmas sound like Don Draper.\n\n36:56.480 --> 37:00.480\nOh, the specter of inequality is-\n\n37:00.480 --> 37:05.360\nWe went to church, took me to Adam Levine's annual Halloween party, and I carried around\n\n37:05.360 --> 37:10.960\ndressed as Commander Fred from Handmaid's Tale with my Scrabble Box.\n\n37:10.960 --> 37:14.320\nAnd I think only four people laughed at that.\n\n37:14.320 --> 37:15.320\nWere there a lot of-\n\n37:15.320 --> 37:19.680\nI think there was an early prediction that that was going to be, that Halloween was going\n\n37:19.680 --> 37:22.320\nto be like an army of Handmaids.\n\n37:22.320 --> 37:25.520\nI've seen three, and I've been to numerous parties.\n\n37:25.520 --> 37:27.600\nYeah, Ricky Lindholm was there.\n\n37:27.600 --> 37:33.200\nRicky from Garfunkel, from Garfunkel and Oates.\n\n37:33.200 --> 37:35.880\nShe was there as a Handmaid, and there was a couple others.\n\n37:35.880 --> 37:39.640\nThere was a couple who were the Commander and the Commander's wife who had a blow-up\n\n37:39.640 --> 37:40.640\ndoll dressed as a Handmaid.\n\n37:40.640 --> 37:41.640\nIn between them?\n\n37:41.640 --> 37:42.640\nOh, boy.\n\n37:42.640 --> 37:43.640\nThey kept fucking it.\n\n37:43.640 --> 37:44.640\nIt was really good.\n\n37:44.640 --> 37:46.800\nI have so many questions about that show.\n\n37:46.800 --> 37:47.800\nI was surprised.\n\n37:47.800 --> 37:48.800\nI can tell you what.\n\n37:48.800 --> 37:49.800\nHow many people were at that party?\n\n37:49.800 --> 37:50.800\nA few hundred?\n\n37:50.800 --> 37:51.800\nNo.\n\n37:51.800 --> 37:52.800\nMore like a thousand.\n\n37:52.800 --> 37:53.800\nOkay.\n\n37:53.800 --> 37:59.440\nAnd I didn't- I was surprised I didn't see any Rick and Morty costumes.\n\n37:59.440 --> 38:02.200\nBut that's kind of a Hollywood rock and roller.\n\n38:02.200 --> 38:04.400\nWe did see them at Luchovim.\n\n38:04.400 --> 38:05.400\nWell, I mean-\n\n38:05.400 --> 38:06.400\nYeah.\n\n38:06.400 --> 38:07.400\nI got texted a hundred pictures of people.\n\n38:07.400 --> 38:08.400\nOkay, good.\n\n38:08.400 --> 38:12.360\nBecause I was like, I remember the year when there were none, and then the year when there\n\n38:12.360 --> 38:16.080\nwere a thousand, and I don't know, within that year.\n\n38:16.080 --> 38:17.080\nI don't know.\n\n38:17.080 --> 38:18.840\nYeah, if it was like-\n\n38:18.840 --> 38:21.120\nIt's gotta be one of the most popular costumes this year.\n\n38:21.120 --> 38:22.120\nBut you know what there is?\n\n38:22.120 --> 38:23.520\nHarmon Quest costumes.\n\n38:23.520 --> 38:24.520\nOh, yeah.\n\n38:24.520 --> 38:30.920\nWell, at the Starburns party that we had, there were literally- because the entire art department\n\n38:30.920 --> 38:36.040\nof Harmon Quest, like they coordinated, there was an army of Spencers, I'm sure you already\n\n38:36.040 --> 38:37.040\nknow that right now.\n\n38:37.040 --> 38:38.040\nYeah.\n\n38:38.040 --> 38:41.240\nBut do you feel better or worse about not coming to the party?\n\n38:41.240 --> 38:42.240\nWorse.\n\n38:42.240 --> 38:44.440\nI tried to go to the party.\n\n38:44.440 --> 38:46.040\nI tried to go three times.\n\n38:46.040 --> 38:49.040\nBut Mario Odyssey came out.\n\n38:49.040 --> 38:50.040\nThat wasn't why I didn't-\n\n38:50.040 --> 38:52.360\nYou were too busy putting that cheese in your seat.\n\n38:52.360 --> 38:53.360\nYeah, I was fucking-\n\n38:53.360 --> 38:55.560\nWhat was the reason when you share it?\n\n38:55.560 --> 39:04.440\nI was like, yeah, that was scared or anxious, like I drove up to park, and yeah.\n\n39:04.440 --> 39:05.440\nYou went all the way there?\n\n39:05.440 --> 39:07.920\nYeah, no, three times I went all the way there.\n\n39:07.920 --> 39:08.920\nYeah.\n\n39:08.920 --> 39:10.040\nThis is, I mean, do you mind it?\n\n39:10.040 --> 39:11.040\nCan we talk about it?\n\n39:11.040 --> 39:12.040\nYeah.\n\n39:12.040 --> 39:19.000\nSo tell it, talk about what goes through your mind that makes the difference between parking\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:24.520\nthe car and going into a party and continuing on, like what are the- I'm trying to figure\n\n39:24.520 --> 39:27.560\nout a better way to rephrase this so that you can answer easy questions.\n\n39:27.560 --> 39:28.560\nYeah.\n\n39:28.560 --> 39:32.200\nI don't know, it's hard because it's not like, I don't know, I've had anxiety where\n\n39:32.200 --> 39:37.280\nit is like a conversation, you know, where it's like if you go in they're gonna be mean\n\n39:37.280 --> 39:42.160\nor you know whatever, and it wasn't like that, lately it's just been more just like a pressure\n\n39:42.160 --> 39:43.160\nupwelling.\n\n39:43.160 --> 39:49.480\nIt's like, I'm gonna do this and then you just get there and it's like, I don't know,\n\n39:49.480 --> 39:50.480\nyou know-\n\n39:50.480 --> 39:57.760\nAre you more worried about, if you, let's, I'm trying to figure out how to phrase this\n\n39:57.760 --> 40:06.440\nso that, because based on my experience, if you had a button in your hand that was, that\n\n40:06.440 --> 40:14.720\nthe amount of pressure on the button created more or less attention on you, more or less\n\n40:14.720 --> 40:21.120\npeople demanding answers from you about how you're doing and how you've been and all this\n\n40:21.120 --> 40:31.760\nstuff, it would you, like, how hard, I guess you're not, you're not afraid of obscurity,\n\n40:31.760 --> 40:33.560\nthat's not the, you're afraid of attention, right?\n\n40:33.560 --> 40:37.720\nI don't know, I mean, when you're saying the button, it's like, I think it's both, like\n\n40:37.720 --> 40:42.640\nI'm thinking, I'm thinking, well, yeah, it's like I'm worried about, I don't know, like\n\n40:42.640 --> 40:46.880\nwhen I was trying to park, I saw all these people outside and I was like, I'm gonna have\n\n40:46.880 --> 40:52.440\nto get past these people to get to the party and like that in its own was like a thing,\n\n40:52.440 --> 40:56.320\nbut it's not like, I didn't not want to talk to those people and I wanted to go to the\n\n40:56.320 --> 41:00.080\nparty because I did want to talk to people, so it's not like I didn't want to be noticed\n\n41:00.080 --> 41:05.240\nand I wanted to be noted, or it's like it's both, but it's not either or neither, but\n\n41:05.240 --> 41:10.920\nyeah, it's kind of lack of control over a social situation where it's like, if you're\n\n41:10.920 --> 41:15.360\nobscure, like I remember being 25 and like the channel 101 days, it's like we all went\n\n41:15.360 --> 41:19.200\nto each other's parties because it was sort of an orgy of the more attention, the better\n\n41:19.200 --> 41:22.960\nand actually we're all on the same level and we can all just like pay attention to each\n\n41:22.960 --> 41:30.920\nother and nobody's really like suffering and then, but like it, for me, it's a control\n\n41:30.920 --> 41:36.880\nissue where I'm like, you know, actually I have nothing to gain anymore and no camaraderie\n\n41:36.880 --> 41:42.560\nto achieve, I only have maybe people that I'd like to talk to and then a whole shit ton\n\n41:42.560 --> 41:48.720\nof people that I can either disappoint or ignore, right, I like that sounds like I'm\n\n41:48.720 --> 41:53.760\ncasting it in terms of like you think you're a rock star, I'm talking about because I don't\n\n41:53.760 --> 41:57.120\nfeel like the camaraderie you say, like I don't feel like I'm gonna go to this party\n\n41:57.120 --> 42:01.360\nand I will feel closer to these people as a result, like that might be true, but that's\n\n42:01.360 --> 42:03.080\nnot what I feel going into it.\n\n42:03.080 --> 42:09.960\nIt's just like this could be fun and then that quickly gets like consumed by everything\n\n42:09.960 --> 42:10.960\nelse.\n\n42:10.960 --> 42:14.160\nWhen the sense of responsibility comes in, when you're like obligation, when you look\n\n42:14.160 --> 42:19.240\nat like a little bit of a minefield of like eight groups of people and you're like, you\n\n42:19.240 --> 42:24.080\nknow what, I'm never gonna like, and then you find yourself in a conversation with\n\n42:24.080 --> 42:29.760\nsomebody and you're like, shit, I don't know when to leave or if I should want to leave.\n\n42:29.760 --> 42:34.360\nI could push a button in my head that made me want to talk to you about avionics for\n\n42:34.360 --> 42:40.180\nthe next hour and a half, I really could, but at a certain point, my wife might come\n\n42:40.180 --> 42:44.680\nup and be like really upset that I've been talking about avionics for 90 minutes or\n\n42:44.680 --> 42:52.000\nI might find out that everybody left the party or I might, you know, I don't know,\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:55.320\nthere's a bunch of people I didn't see, you know, friends of mine and stuff, I'm like,\n\n42:55.320 --> 43:04.600\nI don't know when, every conversation is a weird fencing match except instead of people\n\n43:04.600 --> 43:10.120\ntrying to stab each other, it's like people trying to hug each other and so you can spend\n\n43:10.120 --> 43:17.600\nan indeterminate amount of time and every single conversation can only really end gracefully\n\n43:17.600 --> 43:24.520\nor ungracefully by somebody saying, well, I've decided I'm done talking to you so I'm\n\n43:24.520 --> 43:30.240\ngonna go talk to someone else, which doesn't feel very genuine because it's not practical\n\n43:30.240 --> 43:35.960\nbecause it would be better to say, well, I've enjoyed talking to you but I have to save\n\n43:35.960 --> 43:42.520\na kitten from a tree, but to say I've enjoyed talking to you but I'm bored now or I want\n\n43:42.520 --> 43:45.120\nto see if there's someone better to talk to.\n\n43:45.120 --> 43:47.120\nI sort of did that last night.\n\n43:47.120 --> 43:50.800\nI mean, that's what we're doing all the time at each other parties and I don't and there's\n\n43:50.800 --> 43:56.400\npeople who know how to handle that gracefully and there and I feel more kinship with Spencer\n\n43:56.400 --> 44:00.200\nand I'm like, I use the good old fashioned, hey, I bear back, I have to go pee.\n\n44:00.200 --> 44:04.800\nYeah, because you're the guy that is able to leave, you're not the guy that's struggling\n\n44:04.800 --> 44:07.880\nto not lose at a party, you're always winning.\n\n44:07.880 --> 44:17.720\nWell, I mean, I have my own version of anxiety there but just because Jeff said, he says,\n\n44:17.720 --> 44:19.000\nI gotta go pee.\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.720\nSo why can't you and I say I gotta go pee?\n\n44:21.720 --> 44:22.720\nDo you lie?\n\n44:22.720 --> 44:23.720\nYou don't have to pee that much.\n\n44:23.720 --> 44:27.680\nBut people leave us in conversations, right?\n\n44:27.680 --> 44:34.440\nI'm comfortable saying, hey, I'll be right back or hey, I'm gonna go over and say hi\n\n44:34.440 --> 44:35.440\nto my friend over there.\n\n44:35.440 --> 44:36.440\nI just saw it.\n\n44:36.440 --> 44:37.960\nI'll write, you're comfortable.\n\n44:37.960 --> 44:42.040\nBut that's more key, but that's why I wanted to address that because it's not true what\n\n44:42.040 --> 44:43.040\nyou initially said.\n\n44:43.040 --> 44:44.040\nNo, no.\n\n44:44.040 --> 44:45.040\nDon't just tell everybody you're gonna go pee.\n\n44:45.040 --> 44:46.040\nI will say this.\n\n44:46.040 --> 44:49.720\nYou are more comfortable saying the truth, which is, see you later.\n\n44:49.720 --> 44:54.960\nIf I'm being cornered by a jerk, you're at the drawing room and some guy just won't get\n\n44:54.960 --> 45:00.160\noff your ass, I am very comfortable lying and say, oh, God, I gotta go take a shit.\n\n45:00.160 --> 45:03.040\nI'll be back in four years.\n\n45:03.040 --> 45:07.480\nI'll say whatever it takes to get away from somebody who's punishing me.\n\n45:07.480 --> 45:14.680\nIf they're engaged in a social crime on their own, if they're so drunk or crazy or selfish.\n\n45:14.680 --> 45:18.960\nDepending on how little I'm afraid of getting punched or a drink thrown at me, I'll just\n\n45:18.960 --> 45:24.240\nsay, hey, I'm gonna go hang out with other people and just bone the fuck out.\n\n45:24.240 --> 45:31.240\nBut the thing that you said, Spencer, about pulling up and seeing a crowd, I have my own\n\n45:31.240 --> 45:35.920\nthing about, it's not like, oh my God, I gotta walk through a crowd and everyone's gonna stop\n\n45:35.920 --> 45:36.920\nme.\n\n45:36.920 --> 45:37.920\nIt's not like that.\n\n45:37.920 --> 45:40.640\nIt's not like I'm so rad that that's gonna be a bummer.\n\n45:40.640 --> 45:44.200\nBut there's times when you just don't want to walk through a crowd and you might just\n\n45:44.200 --> 45:47.400\nwant to be able to get from point A to point B without being stopped and you can't be in\n\n45:47.400 --> 45:49.040\ncontrol of that.\n\n45:49.040 --> 45:54.040\nWhen I do comedy shows, I disappear after the show.\n\n45:54.040 --> 45:58.320\nWhen we do it on the Harmon Tour and stuff like that, when the show's over, I usually\n\n45:58.320 --> 46:00.720\nfind a place to be alone.\n\n46:00.720 --> 46:09.600\nI need that few minutes just to go hide, see if church texted, just be complete, I don't\n\n46:09.600 --> 46:15.520\nwant to be around the sound of maybe being asked to talk or do a thing.\n\n46:15.520 --> 46:24.480\nBut I am a jerk, so I'm not uncomfortable wearing the black hat if I really have to get\n\n46:24.480 --> 46:25.680\nout of a situation.\n\n46:25.680 --> 46:32.160\nI don't think, it won't pay in this analysis for us to, you know, like there's no good\n\n46:32.160 --> 46:33.160\nor bad.\n\n46:33.160 --> 46:39.440\nIt's just, but it's worth examining because I observe about myself, I'm like, well, if\n\n46:39.440 --> 46:44.880\nyou do a live show and then you're Santa Claus and there's a line of people, it's like there\n\n46:44.880 --> 46:48.400\nare moments when I feel like this is how I'm comfortable.\n\n46:48.400 --> 46:55.680\nAnd the reason is because it's orderly and it requires an introduction and at a party,\n\n46:55.680 --> 47:01.880\nI think this is like people, it's like, like people go like, hey, how are you?\n\n47:01.880 --> 47:05.960\nLike I don't know, it's just so freeform, it's like orgiastic and I like, I start to freak\n\n47:05.960 --> 47:13.160\nthe fuck out and I spend every conversation that I have at a party, like I hold my drink\n\n47:13.160 --> 47:18.640\nlike, and if it's in a plastic cup as last night, it's like, it's like the cup splits\n\n47:18.640 --> 47:23.400\nopen very early on because I'm squeezing it and I'm, it doesn't matter who I'm talking\n\n47:23.400 --> 47:27.600\nto, it's just like, because I'm always thinking like, what are you supposed to do?\n\n47:27.600 --> 47:28.600\nWhen is this supposed to end?\n\n47:28.600 --> 47:29.880\nIs this going on too long?\n\n47:29.880 --> 47:30.880\nWhat am I supposed to say?\n\n47:30.880 --> 47:32.680\nAm I being a bad person or a good person?\n\n47:32.680 --> 47:33.680\nWhere's Cody?\n\n47:33.680 --> 47:35.640\nLike, like, wait, what am I doing?\n\n47:35.640 --> 47:36.640\nWhat am I doing?\n\n47:36.640 --> 47:37.640\nWhy am I doing this?\n\n47:37.640 --> 47:43.600\nI think, maybe I've mentioned this before on the show, but like, I think a long time\n\n47:43.600 --> 47:47.560\nago and you were my friend when this happened, I just started wearing suits all the time\n\n47:47.560 --> 47:54.200\nand I think that's a social cue body armor thing that people tend to leave me a little\n\n47:54.200 --> 47:55.200\nbit more alone.\n\n47:55.200 --> 47:56.200\nWell, I think it makes-\n\n47:56.200 --> 47:58.200\nSo I get to call the shots on that a little bit more.\n\n47:58.200 --> 48:04.240\nWell, and also, I think that when you get up in the morning, because when you commit\n\n48:04.240 --> 48:11.800\nto being a suit guy, even though it seems second nature to you, when you get up in the\n\n48:11.800 --> 48:18.040\nmorning, like, there's social laws against leaving your house without a minimum amount\n\n48:18.040 --> 48:24.840\nof clothing on and Spencer and I are wearing the minimum amount of clothing.\n\n48:24.840 --> 48:29.960\nLike we're wearing, which means that we actually get up out of bed and we go over to a pile\n\n48:29.960 --> 48:30.960\nof clothes.\n\n48:30.960 --> 48:32.400\nSo am I thanks to Bomfell who never gave me my goddamn clothes?\n\n48:32.400 --> 48:36.160\nLet's not get too distracted, but when I think that that's the-\n\n48:36.160 --> 48:44.080\nI'm pitching, I guess, the advantage socially of having a style is because you actually\n\n48:44.080 --> 48:50.320\nlike on Halloween, like you wake up every morning and you put an amount of attention,\n\n48:50.320 --> 48:55.080\nyou put on a suit of armor and it doesn't have to be about, oh, armor protecting the\n\n48:55.080 --> 48:59.680\nreal you from the outside world, like that's disingenuous.\n\n48:59.680 --> 49:03.600\nIt's more about like, that's also actually the important thing is that you're saying,\n\n49:03.600 --> 49:08.680\nyou're acknowledging every morning that the reason you're leaving your house is to interact\n\n49:08.680 --> 49:14.200\nwith other people and not to put words in your mouth, but Spencer and I don't do that.\n\n49:14.200 --> 49:19.240\nWe get up out of bed and we go, the reason I'm leaving my house is because I have to.\n\n49:19.240 --> 49:23.720\nI have an appointment and so I'm going to put this potato sack on with holes in it for\n\n49:23.720 --> 49:26.800\nmy arms because otherwise I'll get arrested.\n\n49:26.800 --> 49:30.200\nAnd it casts a kind of pawl over the whole thing.\n\n49:30.200 --> 49:33.760\nMeanwhile, you're going like, it's in the way that you use it.\n\n49:33.760 --> 49:37.400\nAnd then every interaction you have, there's a little bit of license for you to-\n\n49:37.400 --> 49:38.400\nTo be alone.\n\n49:38.400 --> 49:40.680\nTo perform.\n\n49:40.680 --> 49:48.040\nOr with a stern look or like-\n\n49:48.040 --> 49:49.560\nWell, sure, there's that too.\n\n49:49.560 --> 49:53.200\nI can be completely alone in public in a suit.\n\n49:53.200 --> 49:57.920\nI can also, like I said before, my impression of myself is everybody can have everyone's\n\n49:57.920 --> 49:59.960\nattention, please leave me alone.\n\n49:59.960 --> 50:03.880\nAnd that's like, I get up, everybody look at me, now fucking shut up.\n\n50:03.880 --> 50:08.000\nAnd I want to, like, I bring earplugs wherever I go because I like to read in public, which\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:11.400\nis self-destructive and stupid because I'm always mad that people are talking.\n\n50:11.400 --> 50:15.080\nIt's like, why did you just get an armchair and read it home?\n\n50:15.080 --> 50:19.320\nYeah, I guess I've kind of said also though that when I go over to my pile of 800 Rick\n\n50:19.320 --> 50:23.400\nand Morty t-shirts and my three pants that do or don't fit depending on how many Twinkies\n\n50:23.400 --> 50:28.800\nI've had that year, like I always have the swirling thoughts in my head about whether\n\n50:28.800 --> 50:33.840\nor not I care whether or not people like the way I look and all this stuff.\n\n50:33.840 --> 50:43.280\nAnd you cut through that before you enter the world because you are formalizing you're\n\n50:43.280 --> 50:44.680\ngetting dressed.\n\n50:44.680 --> 50:48.840\nYou're going, I'm going out into the world and when I'm going out into the world, I'm\n\n50:48.840 --> 50:52.560\nan ambassador of my self-ness to the otherness.\n\n50:52.560 --> 50:57.000\nAnd so that means that if someone comes up to me and says, hey man, you want to buy a\n\n50:57.000 --> 51:01.840\npotato for a three dollars, I don't know what that character is.\n\n51:01.840 --> 51:03.080\nI don't know what race he is.\n\n51:03.080 --> 51:06.240\nI'm sorry for all the emails I'm going to get.\n\n51:06.240 --> 51:09.240\nThat must be a good potato, a three dollar potato.\n\n51:09.240 --> 51:11.560\nAlso, we added an article to dollars.\n\n51:11.560 --> 51:16.600\nBut you can not only, because it's not, it is, it's part armor, part performance, all\n\n51:16.600 --> 51:22.040\nthe stuff that's like a, when we talk, when we do me undies ads and we talk about the\n\n51:22.040 --> 51:27.320\nfirst decision you make when you get out of bed is are you going to put on cotton underwear\n\n51:27.320 --> 51:31.720\nthat are like, oh, I got to protect my nuts from my own pants.\n\n51:31.720 --> 51:36.320\nOr are you going to sheath them in glorious micro mandal?\n\n51:36.320 --> 51:41.280\nWhich actually says to you, the important person to say it to, I love my nuts being\n\n51:41.280 --> 51:46.040\ncradled in, I didn't mean for that synergy to happen.\n\n51:46.040 --> 51:47.040\nRight.\n\n51:47.040 --> 51:50.160\nThere's these, we've talked about it before, I'm sure, that there's two great books by\n\n51:50.160 --> 51:54.520\nQuentin Crisp, one's called Doing It With Style and one's called How to Have a Lifestyle.\n\n51:54.520 --> 52:00.400\nAnd it's about what is style and personal style doesn't mean fashion, it doesn't mean\n\n52:00.400 --> 52:06.000\nmoney, it doesn't mean sex, it doesn't mean power, it's self-knowledge.\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:09.640\nHow you're carrying yourself to other people, to have a camera on yourself.\n\n52:09.640 --> 52:15.080\nLike I'm sure I'm repeating myself, but as Quentin Crisp said, someone asked him what\n\n52:15.080 --> 52:20.840\nis style and he said, style is being yourself only on purpose.\n\n52:20.840 --> 52:26.320\nAnd so that takes a level, like you can be homeless with style, you can be, it doesn't\n\n52:26.320 --> 52:30.880\nhave to be fancy pants, like it's simply who you are.\n\n52:30.880 --> 52:37.160\nLike Spencer, you have style, you have so much style that nine people can show up at\n\n52:37.160 --> 52:41.560\na Halloween party dressed as you and everyone goes, oh fuck, we're all Spencers today.\n\n52:41.560 --> 52:44.560\nIt's just aesthetically terrible style.\n\n52:44.560 --> 52:52.220\nNo, but like you, like when you on Harmon Quest pop out of the wilderness wearing your\n\n52:52.220 --> 52:59.000\nlumberjack shirt and your shorts, like you, you're impersonatable.\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:07.000\nBecause I think it's absolutely okay and for me, beneficial to have a uniform.\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:10.520\nLike I have a lot of clothes in my place and I don't wear any of them.\n\n53:10.520 --> 53:16.880\nI wear my suits, I wear my black shoes, I wear my dress shirts and then I've got a million\n\n53:16.880 --> 53:18.760\nt-shirts that I wear at home.\n\n53:18.760 --> 53:23.080\nAnd then if I, the only time I'm ever not in a suit, I'm wearing one other outfit.\n\n53:23.080 --> 53:27.240\nAnd I just realized like one day is like, I'm sick of picking fucking clothes out in\n\n53:27.240 --> 53:28.240\nthe morning.\n\n53:28.240 --> 53:33.800\nLike for me, I just want to make sure that the dry cleaner, like the stuff that I know\n\n53:33.800 --> 53:37.320\nI'm going to want that week is ready to go.\n\n53:37.320 --> 53:43.840\nAnd my closet is like Einstein's basically, it's just a bunch of blue and gray suits and\n\n53:43.840 --> 53:45.960\na lot of white shirts.\n\n53:45.960 --> 53:49.840\nAnd I find that really relaxing.\n\n53:49.840 --> 53:55.640\nThat's something I don't want to spend time really thinking about as much as I like clothes.\n\n53:55.640 --> 53:57.840\nI don't want to think about variety.\n\n53:57.840 --> 54:01.480\nI just like a nice dark suit with a white shirt and black shoes.\n\n54:01.480 --> 54:02.480\nRight.\n\n54:02.480 --> 54:06.800\nBut somebody who's like, it's the t-shirt culture, which we all live in, like t-shirts\n\n54:06.800 --> 54:11.960\nonce upon a time where like underwear and now they've become a thing you can put on.\n\n54:11.960 --> 54:15.960\nI feel incredibly nude going to the market in a t-shirt like when it's 900,000 degrees\n\n54:15.960 --> 54:17.840\nout like it's been for the last couple of weeks.\n\n54:17.840 --> 54:22.400\nI feel like I'm basically walking to the supermarket like in a bathing suit.\n\n54:22.400 --> 54:28.760\nI think the key is like, as I said, like my therapist has said, like that the new era\n\n54:28.760 --> 54:35.640\nthat we're entering, hopefully that it's different, that the large theme is unconscious\n\n54:35.640 --> 54:37.280\nversus conscious.\n\n54:37.280 --> 54:45.400\nAnd so it's like, it's possible to be unconscious and get up in the morning and go like, I'm\n\n54:45.400 --> 54:54.720\ngoing to pull this idiocracy shirt from this dispenser and throw it on myself.\n\n54:54.720 --> 54:55.720\nAnd that's fine.\n\n54:55.720 --> 55:00.640\nIt's like no one's, we're used to the bad guys being people that tell you what you should\n\n55:00.640 --> 55:02.080\nwear.\n\n55:02.080 --> 55:07.840\nBut somewhere in there, it's like, all the, there's so many things that we don't think\n\n55:07.840 --> 55:10.440\nabout that then we're like worried about.\n\n55:10.440 --> 55:17.200\nAnd like for me and Spencer, and I suppose probably 99% of our listenership, it's like\n\n55:17.200 --> 55:23.920\nconversations with people, small talk, like grace, tact, square dancing of conversation\n\n55:23.920 --> 55:26.840\nwhere you could just go, Hey, it's nice talking to you.\n\n55:26.840 --> 55:32.440\nI'm like, wouldn't you love knowing that like, Hey, I'd love to, I'd love talking to you.\n\n55:32.440 --> 55:34.600\nAnd now I'm going to love talking over there.\n\n55:34.600 --> 55:35.600\nI'm going to walk away.\n\n55:35.600 --> 55:39.880\nIt's like everyone would respond to that and they'd be totally fine with that.\n\n55:39.880 --> 55:42.880\nBut I don't, I don't have those things.\n\n55:42.880 --> 55:48.280\nI don't, I don't, I've, I've, I've been living in a society so luxurious that I've been able\n\n55:48.280 --> 55:54.080\nto slither this far while the entire time maintaining that I don't know how to talk\n\n55:54.080 --> 56:00.640\nto people, don't know how to dress, don't know how to think about race, gender, all\n\n56:00.640 --> 56:06.160\nof these things being myself, but on purpose, I, I've been able to be myself on accident.\n\n56:06.160 --> 56:10.360\nThat's a pretty luxurious thing, but it also had, then it results in all these like, Oh\n\n56:10.360 --> 56:13.080\nshit, I have mold between my big toe and my little toe.\n\n56:13.080 --> 56:18.600\nWell, yeah, no shit, like you, you, you've not thought about a single thing that you've\n\n56:18.600 --> 56:19.600\never done.\n\n56:19.600 --> 56:21.600\nMold between your big toe and little toe means all the way across.\n\n56:21.600 --> 56:24.120\nIt means, means no, none of your toes exist.\n\n56:24.120 --> 56:26.200\nI was, I got derailed by my own fucking thing.\n\n56:26.200 --> 56:30.720\nI mean, I, like, like church has style, like crazy, and it's like, I love it because like\n\n56:30.720 --> 56:35.760\nwe can go out clothes shopping and like, we went the other day to a, to a store that she\n\n56:35.760 --> 56:42.280\nlikes downtown and like, I like going through the racks and looking for stuff for her.\n\n56:42.280 --> 56:44.920\nAnd sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm wrong, but like, and she's like, Oh, I love\n\n56:44.920 --> 56:49.640\nthat you, she's like, I like when you go out and like, like, like help, like, like, like\n\n56:49.640 --> 56:54.720\nlook for stuff, but also like, like we, we can have a lot of fun in the clothes store\n\n56:54.720 --> 57:02.240\nbecause it's not that like clothing is your identity, but the execution of our style has\n\n57:02.240 --> 57:04.160\nsomething to do with fashion.\n\n57:04.160 --> 57:11.440\nYours doesn't like the execution of your style and Spencer's style is not fashion.\n\n57:11.440 --> 57:15.280\nIt's other things, you know, it's more about brains and, you know, and the writing and\n\n57:15.280 --> 57:16.640\nthe products and things like that.\n\n57:16.640 --> 57:21.240\nYeah, yeah, but yeah, and then we, and then that's why we, that's why we murder people.\n\n57:21.240 --> 57:24.320\nYou know who else has style, Callie Cazoo.\n\n57:24.320 --> 57:25.880\nDo you guys know her?\n\n57:25.880 --> 57:26.880\nI do.\n\n57:26.880 --> 57:28.640\nShe's doing a Kickstarter.\n\n57:28.640 --> 57:29.640\nCheck it out.\n\n57:29.640 --> 57:30.640\nI like her music.\n\n57:30.640 --> 57:32.640\nShe wants to buy more Aqua, Aqua Seafoam boots.\n\n57:32.640 --> 57:34.360\nIf you go to her Kickstarter.\n\n57:34.360 --> 57:38.760\nYeah, you can go to support Callie Cazoo's third album, Extravaganza.\n\n57:38.760 --> 57:43.400\nI already donated, you should because she'll give you free shit.\n\n57:43.400 --> 57:47.160\nLike I made a small donation, she's gonna give me a bunch of little drawings and like\n\n57:47.160 --> 57:48.160\ngroovy stuff.\n\n57:48.160 --> 57:49.160\nOh yeah.\n\n57:49.160 --> 57:50.160\nYeah.\n\n57:50.160 --> 57:53.920\nIt's like, like you don't get nothing for paying something, you get something for paying\n\n57:53.920 --> 57:54.920\nsomething.\n\n57:54.920 --> 57:55.920\nIt's gonna be great.\n\n57:55.920 --> 57:56.920\nYeah.\n\n57:56.920 --> 58:04.120\nA guy touched my girlfriend's face in a bar while I watched and did nothing.\n\n58:04.120 --> 58:06.880\nLike in a romantic sense or like he accidentally brushed her?\n\n58:06.880 --> 58:09.120\nWell, you tell me.\n\n58:09.120 --> 58:17.160\nYeah, in this new world of like, okay, let's be respectful and nice and all this shit.\n\n58:17.160 --> 58:23.280\nIt's like, I feel like I was really high at the Halloween party and I really got a good\n\n58:23.280 --> 58:24.280\nhandle on this.\n\n58:24.280 --> 58:27.640\nI was talking to a bunch of other beta males about how like the accountability that we\n\n58:27.640 --> 58:34.040\nhave where it's like, we're emerging into this place now where it's like, let's take\n\n58:34.040 --> 58:35.720\ndown the alphas.\n\n58:35.720 --> 58:37.120\nThey're so disrespectful.\n\n58:37.120 --> 58:38.120\nThey're terrible.\n\n58:38.120 --> 58:39.440\nThey're all these terrible things.\n\n58:39.440 --> 58:46.440\nAnd then it's like, wait a minute, though, to the extent that it's every man for himself,\n\n58:46.440 --> 58:54.960\nif you're a beta and you start to panic where you're like, oh, I think we invented everything\n\n58:54.960 --> 58:57.640\nthat like holds us together.\n\n58:57.640 --> 59:04.760\nI'm self identifying with like a sub race of like men that are like, I don't want to\n\n59:04.760 --> 59:10.120\nbeat another man's skull in if he looks at my girl from the wrong way.\n\n59:10.120 --> 59:15.920\nI want to have the confidence to prance about the world knowing that I own it because I'm\n\n59:15.920 --> 59:18.080\ntalented because guess what?\n\n59:18.080 --> 59:25.960\nYour muscles will get you this far, not this far, that that is a that's called modern society.\n\n59:25.960 --> 59:31.720\nAnd I just got this taste of it as in this bar with Cody, we had biked from my house\n\n59:31.720 --> 59:35.080\nto a bar, and we're minding our own business.\n\n59:35.080 --> 59:43.600\nI'm 44 goddamn years old, like girlfriend is 30 fucking two years old.\n\n59:43.600 --> 59:45.840\nWe're adults.\n\n59:45.840 --> 59:51.640\nWe're just taking our bicycles, which by the way, every time we stopped at a stop light,\n\n59:51.640 --> 59:55.600\nwhatever, there was like a guy who came up to Cody and, you know, it was like, like,\n\n59:55.600 --> 59:58.520\nhey, guys, some kind of biking club.\n\n59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.600\nIt's

my girlfriend, but it's like I'm just looking\n\n01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.160\nat it through new eyes seeing it where I'm like I'm like seeing it now.\n\n01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.720\nIt's it's it's it's it's luminol.\n\n01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.720\nRight.\n\n01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:24.680\nIt's our like fecal fecal detector, like a black light and I'm seeing like common shit\n\n01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.680\neverywhere.\n\n01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:32.040\nThen you go go to this, then we go to this bar and like I like like let's take photos\n\n01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:40.000\nof each other sitting at the bar holding cocktails with our biker helmet on like fun.\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.800\nSo she takes a picture of me and she's the lighting is such that she should take my stool.\n\n01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.080\nIt takes picture.\n\n01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.840\nI stand back taking a couple pictures of Cody.\n\n01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.160\nShe's got her helmet on.\n\n01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.320\nShe's holding a cocktail adjusting.\n\n01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.320\nI want it to be good.\n\n01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.600\nI want it to be good for

--> 01:01:22.720\nand and you tell me what I should do when and where but all right I got it all loaded\n\n01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.920\nup here's here's here's here's what I don't do at that moment.\n\n01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.840\nI don't go no fuck off.\n\n01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:38.920\nThat's what you should and the reason I don't do it at that moment is because I don't assume\n\n01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:46.920\nthat what's about to happen is going to happen right I think that I'm in Hollywood and he's\n\n01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:53.360\na DP like that like if that it would be my male ego that would make me go fuck you don't\n\n01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:57.960\nshut up and that actually this is how you make new friends.\n\n01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.640\nThis is how you have a good time.\n\n01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.500\nThis is why you came to a bar.\n\n01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:08.040\nThis is why this is overall my experience like someone from your community says hey\n\n01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.040\nyou live in Los Angeles.\n\n01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.680\nI know just trying to take a picture here.\n\n01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.120\nI I work for fucking Bruckheimer.\n\n01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.840\nI don't like I don't make it look like a goddamn Transformers movie.\n\n01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:22.720\nIf you move this candle he said can I help sorry can I help like you know like like like\n\n01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:27.920\ncame in with this thing and my reflexive response because I insist because I'm a good person\n\n01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:35.000\nit was was was yeah yeah yeah yeah and he instead of taking my camera now he moves forward\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.600\nbecause he's on the move and he's moving past me and he's moving over to Coney and\n\n01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:47.720\nhe and and so now it's too late it's like like his his suggestion of how to make the\n\n01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:58.680\npicture better is he wants to take the biker helmet that's on her head and turn it backwards\n\n01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:03.040\nwhich by the way doesn't make it look any different.\n\n01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.960\nThat's the kind of suggestion you'd hear from the kind of person who would suggest at a\n\n01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:14.160\nbar to help you take a photo yeah that's strange well except that there might I would I would\n\n01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:20.440\nargue with you either for the sake of my pride or for the sake of humanity's defense I would\n\n01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:28.760\nsay that honestly Spencer it like like it sometimes if not most of the time a stranger\n\n01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:34.240\nwho says can I suggest something can I offer something can I help you can I can improve\n\n01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.520\nyour life actually like it's it's kind of like if you don't if you resist the urge to\n\n01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:45.160\nplant it of the apes them that it it actually turns out to be fine right I guess I'm reading\n\n01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:50.960\ntoo much into the tone of voice you use well that's true you started the story telling\n\n01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:57.000\nyou I'm just the honestly the tone of voice if that's how that's not the kind of help\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.640\nI want yeah let's stop there and reset because that's actually making it very clear that\n\n01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:07.160\nit's important that I actually try to do a realistic impression of the guy okay and\n\n01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:13.480\nI'm gonna try it like I it agonizes me to try it because I'm reliving trauma sorry you\n\n01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:20.680\ngot this but like I like I guess my best impression would be like hey can I make a suggestion\n\n01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:27.840\nhere or is that like hey even hand hey can I help you with this photo or no that sounds\n\n01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:32.800\nrapey too I just like I didn't it sounded like sounded normal hey can I touch your girlfriend's\n\n01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:40.040\nface the guy didn't and so and then so then yeah he turns the hat backwards and I'm like\n\n01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:48.520\nare you

01:05:13.440\nit whatever level he thought he wanted to do it on I all I just want to are now I want\n\n01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:18.440\nto beat his brains and I want to fucking pound him because I'm like you'd never ever ever\n\n01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:23.560\nwanted to help do anything and this is before sexuality gets into it he could be gay for\n\n01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:28.440\nall I know I

piss on it this is before now the next thing that\n\n01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:48.320\nhappens is because he put it fucking he puts her hat on backwards now well guess what her\n\n01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:56.240\nhair is different now now he has to stroke her face and move her hair out of the way\n\n01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:01.640\nas I'm holding a camera three feet from my girlfriend in broad daylight in a bar while\n\n01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:08.680\na man that didn't beat me up that never said I'm a bigger man than you I choose to challenge\n\n01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:16.920\nyou well just

also assuming if we're\n\n01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:59.400\nnot gonna go with hierarchy as a measurement of how you should treat women if in other\n\n01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:08.640\nwords beta males are controlling like how alphas treat women because we own alphas do\n\n01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:16.000\nwe have to like have accountability and go okay now that the zoo is loose like oh so\n\n01:07:16.000

back\n\n01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:34.080\nto my comfort zone which is not me hiding from him but is me owning everything that's\n\n01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:39.120\nthe important thing like how do I get back to my comfort zone where I'm king shit not\n\n01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:43.120\nwhere I'm hiding in a bush the Cody was Cody uncomfortable and freaked out by this like how\n\n01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:48.520\ndid she hated it she hated it and you can see in the photo there's a photo of her with\n\n01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:56.160\na backwards bike helmet I went her face is crimson yuck and she's forcing a smile and\n\n01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:02.720\nshe looks great because women deal with that all the time and they just and and the photos\n\n01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:09.400\ntaken by a fucking cock who just watched what is that the photo where her hair looks perfect\n\n01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:15.160\nand her hat is on backwards yeah that's amazing my favorite photo of looks ridiculous and\n\n01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:21.640\nshe looks fucking like purple and it's and and and every time I look at my own bike helmet\n\n01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:28.040\nI my dick shrivels up into my abdomen and and and I like I don't I just like these are\n\n01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:32.280\nnew questions that are going to emerge if we're going to be good men if we're going to also\n\n01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:37.200\nsay because we can't just say hey don't jerk off into a pot of plant blocker door with\n\n01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:45.400\nlike that that you know what the society starts with guys that can't throw a spear as hard\n\n01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:50.880\nsaying yeah but I can type a funnier joke than you and it and and and then at that translates\n\n01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:55.200\ninto like hierarchy so it's like I think there might be a little bit of like I need to learn\n\n01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:02.400\nhow to punch a dude in the fucking face verbally or as gallant as you where it's like like\n\n01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:07.520\nlike like oh you would I know that you you you you spent 20 years before you finally\n\n01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.080\ngot head butted in there your nose broke but like that was 20 years of you having recourse\n\n01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:19.640\nto masculinity I like I like like I I have to learn so like to recognize that and then\n\n01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:25.920\nlike react like my adrenaline just froze me I'm like this dude is just like oh oh oh oh\n\n01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:30.080\nhe's just touching my girlfriend's face and then the time for it faster than it takes\n\n01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:36.520\nme to even think that he's done it took this long it took that long mm-hmm what am I supposed\n\n01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:43.520\nto do cut that off halfway I just say hey get back here hey mister I what am I supposed\n\n01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:47.960\nto do yeah timing is always going to be hard because it's never going to be the perfect\n\n01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:51.880\ntiming you're never going to make it in time you're never going to hit it right in the middle\n\n01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:56.920\nit's always going to be too late I mean obviously hindsight's 2020 right so it's not like we\n\n01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:01.400\ndid anything wrong I spent the last 23 years calling everybody I thought it was a cunt\n\n01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.480\na cunt and this one cunt punched me in the fucking nose and broke my nose but what about\n\n01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:08.840\ntiming like what we have infinite timing now what I would have said I would have said hey\n\n01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:17.280\nman you don't touch a woman without her consent oh damn I mean you gave him permission to help\n\n01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:21.360\nwith a picture right you certainly didn't give her permission anyone permission to touch\n\n01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.960\na woman right right he didn't give him so but in real so you would you would say that\n\n01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:30.600\nif I were a super if I were a superhero that's what I would have done if I were in your if\n\n01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:36.400\nyou're a superhuman not a superhero if you're a superhuman if you had so I was a natural\n\n01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:41.480\nit no if you could move faster than human reflex no would say it as his fingers touched\n\n01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:48.000\nher face right or afterwards okay well so that really should we do that yeah he does\n\n01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.800\nthat and now he's gone and go hey man yeah hey yeah yeah that's not it's that's the thing\n\n01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:58.560\nthe timing's not gonna like it and then everyone ever goes like what's going on sounds like\n\n01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:05.000\nsomeone wants everything that's going normally to stop hey mister hey you don't treat a lady\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.040\nlike that you hear and then Cody if she's worth her salt is gonna go it's okay it's fine\n\n01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:17.600\nplease don't protract this trauma please don't do right it's when someone abuses the system\n\n01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:23.920\nand subverts the rule of law to make everyone uncomfortable there's not really a way to just\n\n01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:29.480\nI'm sorry no to make one person uncomfortable versus the 40 people I make uncomfortable\n\n01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:35.640\nby calling him out right but the world is uncomfortable by this stuff it's it's not it's\n\n01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:40.160\nnot supposed to be comfortable the balance was upset when he touched someone you know\n\n01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:44.920\nthat was that was what through and then everyone else has to make the decision to either be\n\n01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:49.080\ncool or not be cool but that's because of him it's not like I mean obviously it is a\n\n01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:53.040\ndecision you're making but it's not the decision that you were forced to make it was a decision\n\n01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:59.880\nthat he forced on you by breaking the balance and you know disrespecting personal boundaries\n\n01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:04.440\nyeah and to me the tragedy is so three weeks from now I'm gonna be taking a picture of\n\n01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:10.520\nmy girlfriend and like Michelle Gondry is gonna come up or

how\n\n01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:08.960\nthis all started so now like now let's let's reboot and like figure out a way through these\n\n01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:16.040\nmoments together where we don't take the course we took six thousand years ago where we went\n\n01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:20.920\nyou know what enough is enough from now on if you love a man and you're gonna have babies\n\n01:16:20.920 -->

like fucking don't do that like like don't like\n\n01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:34.160\nI didn't let it go it wasn't making things better I escalated shit and she's just like\n\n01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:41.640\nfucking don't ever do that again and like I wanted instant justice and you're not going\n\n01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.840\nto get it from that fucking asshole that's the thing it's gonna be a woman's worst nightmare\n\n01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.880\nnot to mansplain what that is but it's gotta be like there's gotta be a highway cone where\n\n01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:55.000\nthey're like well yeah I'd be nice if if there was a but no you're yeah this is my worst\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.280\nnightmare now I have to visit Goths like like I'm always the thing of saying something that\n\n01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:05.240\nhurts the person's feelings as they walk away that's that's not very healthy and once\n\n01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:12.040\nit got my nose broken so I mean the truth is in like a perfectly natural primate society\n\n01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:16.400\nlook I don't know there's eight billion other dudes if they all wanted to gang up on me and\n\n01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:21.320\nbeat me up they can have all my shit so then we have capitalism then we have politics then\n\n01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.520\nwe have government so like we all wake up every day in a world where they're like you're not\n\n01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:29.320\nallowed to climb in my window and have what I have I didn't put in a spirit gum on this\n\n01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:33.920\nbeard and it's coming up because I'm laughing too much and now my fucking beard's popping\n\n01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:40.000\nup and I'm like what kind of commander we're all laughing too much we're all laughing too\n\n01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:48.360\nmuch anyways we were about to I think segue into maybe D&D but I do feel like might whereas\n\n01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:53.000\nusually where we segue into D&D and then we heap on dispensary go like okay now quickly\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:00.520\ndo a recap as part of the D&D segment we I think it might help Spencer if we identify\n\n01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:08.880\na pre D&D period before we start playing D&D where we where we figure out what the fuck\n\n01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:13.000\nhappened yes no no I'm saying I because it's not on him because you guys played once I\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.800\nthink when I wasn't here and we haven't played rock as you weren't here Spencer like it seems\n\n01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.320\nlike it's been a couple months since I've played D&D I think you're at the last one\n\n01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:25.080\nwas I I don't fucking we turn in the missions we've all got licensed to not know what the\n\n01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:31.080\nhell yeah let's let's before I do the the role of the music Spencer like do you have\n\n01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:36.760\nthe sheets and in the film plan yeah yeah hand those out because we have loads of time\n\n01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:42.960\nright now and let's get this at least back up in the air while I get set stuff out let's\n\n01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:47.480\ndo a little bit of podcast business because we're like let's be transparent about this\n\n01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:52.360\nwe moved from the venue where we had a live audience into this place and then we're like\n\n01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:56.840\nwe had a discussion tonight we're like pulled up the numbers of like like who's listening\n\n01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:01.240\nwhen and who's you know like and it looks like well I mean there's a million ways to\n\n01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:07.560\nlook at a million different numbers but like there's an indication that this transition\n\n01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:15.480\nis costing us like people's faith that there's that the upset is like we've cracked the whip\n\n01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:20.080\nhere whether it's people thinking that the podcast is over and not and they don't have\n\n01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:23.560\ncommunication that the podcast is continuing or whether it's people that genuinely hate\n\n01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:28.560\nthis format and don't know it'll ever end like who knows there's a million variables\n\n01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:33.240\nbut we did talk a lot tonight about what we I think what we kind of came to the agreement\n\n01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:36.960\non is that we don't know what's going on we don't know when the space will be back when\n\n01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:41.320\nthe space is back we don't know exactly what that's going to look like we don't we don't\n\n01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:47.600\nwant it to be us doing a booth podcast like this forever that that's not the permanent\n\n01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:52.000\nthis doesn't represent our dream this isn't our fantasy but then you would say well what\n\n01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.960\nis your dream what is your fantasy and we would say we're not sure I don't think that\n\n01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:01.760\nwhatever we were doing before represented me thinking we were nailing it which is why\n\n01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:06.280\nmaybe for me it's it's easier to go oh fuck it we're doing it from this booth from now\n\n01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:14.560\non Viva de France and maybe people are going what the fuck because you but but I all I can\n\n01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:25.680\nsay is we're open to anything internally we're going to try to like we're working on getting\n\n01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:31.920\nthe venue back up that's not because we think that the show should be what it was before\n\n01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:39.200\nwe also don't think this is ideal we don't know what the fuck we're doing we we want\n\n01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:44.800\nto like we we're talking about maybe like we'll go around California and do like crazy\n\n01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:54.200\nlike pop-up shows because that'll be fun like because we'll have an audience for that there's\n\n01:21:54.200 --> 01:22:02.920\nthere's ways to make the VO booth version of the show more like worth fucking listening\n\n01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:08.360\nto live I don't know but after you left that conversation actually it's not really the\n\n01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:12.720\nsubscribership that's in trouble it's actually the crazy thing is maybe a totally organic\n\n01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:16.960\nthing which is that the people listening to the free version of the podcast it's just\n\n01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:23.280\nplummeted after we transitioned which is just like an earthquake it's like well we our show\n\n01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:28.800\ngot canceled and there was no communication about you know why because that one gift that\n\n01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:34.320\nJane posted it was the fuck it was Jane yeah she fucking took it she fucking took it all\n\n01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:38.640\ndown I was hoping that we could mention her tonight in the tonight show because I definitely\n\n01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:50.880\ndid want to continue a insane cycle of whether or not yeah I don't I definitely was hoping\n\n01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:56.720\nfor sure and Steve and I are characters all right the dispensing of the character sheets\n\n01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:03.400\nis happening yeah all right so Spencer I'm woefully unprepared I apparently don't have\n\n01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:08.400\nmy dice or my laptop so both my laptop is on my phone and my dice is going to be on\n\n01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:13.400\nmy phone phone dice all right but we didn't talk at all about what had happened we're\n\n01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:18.440\ngonna we're gonna get to the bottom of this right now just let me just say that being\n\n01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:24.240\ngood in 2017 it's not always gonna be comfortable and we're not always gonna do the right thing\n\n01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:31.200\nbut it's always gonna be the wrong thing to just go oh that sucks I'll deal with it later\n\n01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.160\nyou know what look yeah we've been doing this podcast for a long time we've had a lot of\n\n01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:44.040\nfun it's never been perfect it's very lazy and fly by night but we want the people listening\n\n01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:51.160\nto know that this we are all committed to finding out what the new better version of\n\n01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:57.720\nthis is and we're gonna do it I was talking about sexual assault oh oh oh no that's come\n\n01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:06.600\non that's that's just gonna happen right all right that was a joke I know it's it's I mean\n\n01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:18.560\nit's it's true though bark box is in your character she is it yeah yeah I had a conversation\n\n01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:22.600\nwith my therapist that I thought was so fucking fascinating because we've been to she's been\n\n01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:26.720\nI think she may be using me as a case study because I'm like a straight white male and\n\n01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:33.040\nlike this shit is like in the psychological community this movement that's happening\n\n01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:39.680\nright now people should know maybe that this is measurable and it is a real movement because\n\n01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:45.560\nthe people who get paid $200 a session to talk to you about what's fucking you up they're\n\n01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:50.720\nall talking about it and these are snobs who do not normally pay attention to what you're\n\n01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:56.000\ntalking about they do not care they dismiss it as like pockets of this that and it has\n\n01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.080\ndisrupted their entire practice it has disrupted their calendar of how you're going to self\n\n01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:07.000\nactualize and what and how couples interact particularly the Weinstein thing couples\n\n01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:14.920\ntherapists are experiencing this flood of women in couples saying yeah well here are\n\n01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:19.960\nmy assaults and the man and the couple going I didn't know that and then you go from there\n\n01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:24.760\ninto a yachtsie game or into a fucking like Candyland game of like you don't know like\n\n01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:29.800\nbecause no one's ever communicated about it and everything is gone insane and I think\n\n01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:36.520\nfor that reason maybe my therapist is kind of fascinated with my like of like my point\n\n01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:42.080\nof view like what's going on with it and I have like an I almost came like whatever we\n\n01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:45.400\nshould play D&D I don't want to I feel like I feel like me talking about the stuff is\n\n01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:51.160\nwhy our subscribers like went away or listeners I think nothing is more helpful than for men\n\n01:25:51.160 --> 01:26:00.360\ntalking about women's issues well that's a dumb cheap shot like we're all right about\n\n01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:06.880\neverything I mean I had a conversation with my therapist about what I was experiencing\n\n01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:13.800\nas a man about all this stuff and she was telling me as a gay person like what in it\n\n01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:19.720\nlike how it works being like feeling like you're part of a demographic that is under\n\n01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:26.360\na microscope and a thing that was crazy to me was what she taught she talked about like\n\n01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:31.000\nwell you know like when gay rights are like violated or when when things are coming up\n\n01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.320\nin the news like some kid gets like handcuffed to a fence and beaten because he's gay or\n\n01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:42.640\nsomething her explaining to me that there's like this fear if a gay person an individual\n\n01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:47.600\ngay person is reading the newspaper and reads that story that beyond any outrage beyond\n\n01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:55.120\nany like anything that there's like this weird shame that creeps in where it's like oh are\n\n01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:59.200\nthey it's not like are they coming for me next or maybe I shouldn't be gay it's just\n\n01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:04.240\nsort of like when are they gonna stop looking at me when are they gonna stop paying attention\n\n01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:09.200\nto me right like like and I was like I was so overwhelmed with her characterization\n\n01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:13.560\nof it where I was like I was like oh man you know what I don't I don't think I ever understood\n\n01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:20.200\nthat I don't I think that everybody just intellectualizes like this stuff because it gets reduced\n\n01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:25.920\nto like this like a strategic game of like oh I understand your outrage I understand\n\n01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:30.800\nyour anger I understand unfairness you work for this you should get that but like we were\n\n01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:34.640\nnot communicating about the thing that we could all relate to which is like holy fuck I hope\n\n01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:39.560\nnobody kicks my fucking ass next I hope nobody fucking comes for me I hope I hope I didn't\n\n01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.680\nmake a bad choice did I make a choice should I be gay what's going on like I don't know\n\n01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:49.120\nlike it's not prideful they don't have gay fear parades they don't have it's like it's\n\n01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.840\nnot right it's not a right way to express anything and yet it's something we all share\n\n01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:59.040\nlike you worry about it and I was bursting the tears because I was like I didn't know\n\n01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:06.000\nI didn't know you guys felt that way I didn't I I only understood that you'd be angry you\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.520\nknow I didn't I didn't know that you'd be like ashamed I didn't know that you'd react\n\n01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:14.680\nto a story in a paper of somebody getting gaybashed with shame I thought you'd react with anger\n\n01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:23.840\nand fear but not shame and I think that like anyways all right that's been our show thanks\n\n01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:29.400\nfor okay so we're in a forest and the fucking goblin attacked us whatever whatever you fucking\n\n01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:34.360\nNazi we had a whole episode after that all right where were we all right yeah take me\n\n01:28:34.360 -->

before that our heroes were\n\n01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:02.560\ndoing a mission oh boy they exercised a child and then they saved that child from a priest\n\n01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:08.040\nthat was trying to exercise the child they took the priest into custody custody where\n\n01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:13.520\nthey were going to take him back to the home base and you know what happened assassins\n\n01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:19.400\nhappened they came in and they stabbed up Patchens and they stabbed up Diarrhea Jr.\n\n01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:26.160\nand the the prior ran away he was your captive and he ran away oh boy the assassins ran away\n\n01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:31.960\nand it turned out they had a powerful gem that Patchens owned and he was besides himself\n\n01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:37.320\nwith rage that it was allowed to be taken from him you met up with this guy called\n\n01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:42.400\nGeffen and he gave you back the prior and and you guys went back to the home base where\n\n01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:48.080\nyou turned in the mission and Patchens went to talk to the people and the prior went to\n\n01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:54.080\ntalk to the people and you told Patchens you'd meet him at a local tavern after the meeting\n\n01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:59.480\nthe captain said you can turn in your mission papers with Zellie at the commissary to get\n\n01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:07.600\npaid brother Absalom was looking at you brother Absalom you met and he gave you an orangutan\n\n01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:20.600\nball there was an umber hole but it was non-canon hell yeah hey okay I have questions about\n\n01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:25.680\nthe uh what was the that's a great way to start off anyone have questions was the orangutan\n\n01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:30.400\nthing or what was that when you first ran back into pure burn abbey um you met brother\n\n01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:35.800\nAbsalom right and he he was like yo what up and then you were like weren't you working\n\n01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.200\non that thing to get us not have to sign all this paperwork and he was like yeah here you\n\n01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:45.440\ngo here's an orangutan ball someone's an orangutan all right and was that at that time did we\n\n01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:51.600\nregard that as a random response um it it seemed like the kind of thing that was someone\n\n01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:58.160\ntrying to yes and an improv you made right okay fair enough all right so uh we're off\n\n01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:03.280\nto skull and bone the bar right to go talk to Patchens or something like that yeah and\n\n01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:08.360\nto be clear so my drunken question is so we didn't get like a new mission from anybody\n\n01:34:08.360 -->

went back and then the I got yelled at patches what you found\n\n01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:14.600\npatches I found patches in a corner and he was really scared corner of what just the corner of\n\n01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:21.000\nthe commissary and and he was just he really doesn't want anything to do with us anymore\n\n01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:28.200\nso I gave him my slingshot and I told him he didn't want help he definitely did not want our help\n\n01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:35.560\noh cool so you said would you like our help and he said no yeah and he was he didn't say anything\n\n01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:42.200\npassive aggressive like well you haven't helped that much so far or you've your help hasn't\n\n01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:45.640\nturned out that good yeah something a passive aggressive people say where they really want\n\n01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:52.600\nyou to help he made it abundantly clear that you said no I got this covered I'm totally\n\n01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:57.240\nconfident person no no he didn't seem confident right but he also I don't know that we were\n\n01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:02.200\nadditive in any way so he seemed like he needed help but also didn't want to owe us anything and\n\n01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:08.120\njust wanted to make us feel guilty and help him I think that he felt more like if we went with him\n\n01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:13.480\nwe would royally fuck it up for him like he had better chances without us right because he was\n\n01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:20.520\ndoing so good with his artifact by guarding a door yeah you just sleep in overrun by vampires\n\n01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:26.440\nall right well sounds like should we follow him doesn't sound like it I mean if you told me\n\n01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:29.720\nsomething different like if you were able to convey nuance to me like that would make it clear\n\n01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:34.920\nthat he actually wanted our help well I mean I would say let's go follow him yeah well he was I\n\n01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:39.560\nasked him I was like well what are the stakes and he was like let personally in my life and death but\n\n01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:47.080\nalso the whole world right and I feel like you said do you want help and he was like no yeah\n\n01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:53.960\nreally that's unequivocal about it he said no he didn't say uh from my experience doesn't seem\n\n01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:58.120\nlike you guys helped that much because that would be a different answer I mean he did do that too\n\n01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:03.000\noh okay he did that too yeah he was which means he did that instead because he can't do both I\n\n01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.720\ndon't know you can't be definitive and I really got the sense that it wasn't passive aggression\n\n01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:13.240\nhe was just very mad and very scared and very upset and really didn't think we were helpful I say\n\n01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:20.120\nI say fuck him let him do his own thing yeah like we're gonna go find passions gem yeah no\n\n01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:24.360\nit I mean not when he's gonna make it difficult to help him I mean I'm not like I'm in this for the\n\n01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:29.960\nambitious you know glory and stuff but like what the the the the adventure of passions gem doesn't\n\n01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:33.880\nreally sound like a well what if I know the adventure of passions gem sounds like an amazing\n\n01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:39.640\nadventure the adventure of convincing passions that he needs help well sounds like the first 40\n\n01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:45.240\nyears of my fucking life what if we man who knew too little to him and like we're in this in the\n\n01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:50.200\nshadows and making everything happen and he just thought he was doing well I I don't think we're\n\n01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:56.600\ntalented enough to do what do we like the so like he's Inspector Crusoe and we're fate yeah I don't\n\n01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:03.160\nthink we've graduated to that level oh look look I'm just blue skying here how about this why don't\n\n01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:09.400\nwe walk back back to the to the abbey or wherever we go and talk and see like we need a new mission\n\n01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:14.040\nobviously because we're basically homeless we got 20 gold burning the hole in our pocket but that's\n\n01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:18.680\na lot we don't need a new mission should we put it on black hey guys we work for the church\n\n01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:24.600\nmilitant and we got you know we have a we took an oath we have a job to do why don't we have\n\n01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:28.920\nthis why don't we go back find out they have a new job for us if it sounds less interesting than\n\n01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:38.520\nthe adventure of passions gem uh then we take we go we go shadow passions around I don't think\n\n01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:43.080\nshadowing passions is going to be a realistic option if we wait five more minutes especially\n\n01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:49.720\nwho do we talk to about finding a new mission for us uh brother absalom okay why don't we go back\n\n01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:54.680\nand talk to brother absalon and then we'll tell him about passions and see what he thinks about\n\n01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:02.600\nI will can I I don't want to be negative nelly but one of the reasons why we didn't bring passions\n\n01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:07.400\nup in the first place is because when we were debriefing passions made it very clear to me\n\n01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:13.720\nthat he doesn't want the church of the silver flame knowing about his ish right\n\n01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:21.560\nthat that was clear so if you care about passions oh that would have been good to mention the recap\n\n01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:25.320\nthat that's yeah that's great that you remember that's accurate though right no no I know that's\n\n01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:30.040\ngreat I didn't I didn't I let I let passions have as though it was a it was a thing like I I knew\n\n01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:34.520\nthat passions didn't want us talking about because he'd been big shit trouble with the uh with the\n\n01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:39.320\nchurch it wasn't quite sure but I decided like I like this passions kid he helped us a lot\n\n01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:45.320\nlike if I were up to me I'd like to help him you know I don't know if diarrhea is an unreliable\n\n01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:50.760\nnarrator like if I if I heard a kid say if he was like dragging his feet and going like no I don't\n\n01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:57.160\nneed any help don't need anybody I'd be like well I'm 40 so I think you do need help and that's cool\n\n01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:01.400\nbecause when I was 20 that's how I talked to when I needed help but I said that's why I said\n\n01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:05.880\ndid he say no or was he a little fucking shlubby about it because if he's shlubby about it let's\n\n01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:11.240\ngo chase this kid down and save him from himself uh maybe I'm just bad with people was he a little\n\n01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:15.160\nshlubby yeah maybe it was a little shlubby his little mealy mouth his little like indirect like\n\n01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:19.880\nwell well basically when it all comes down dude I don't even know yeah yeah all right well let's go\n\n01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:25.800\nget the kid right yeah he's our friend you know what the more I say it because I said it now twice\n\n01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:34.360\nbut the more I say the adventure of Patchens gem it just it seems like a if I was in a bookstore\n\n01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:41.240\nand I saw that on a book I go I'm fucking give that a read it sounds like at least one\n\n01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:47.320\nAnjanu's gonna get her first kiss in that adventure yeah and maybe it'll be us uh no it's a little\n\n01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:53.000\nokay so I'm in other words in that conversation I'm kind of like oh Patchens that's why I was\n\n01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:57.880\nasking him that stuff I was like did he say no or was he kind of like poopy face about it now I'm\n\n01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:05.000\nlike I'm like in the middle of my drink I'm like all right look I want to go find him let's all run\n\n01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.680\nout and go see if we can get to the bottom of this with Patchens yeah we run out to look for\n\n01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:15.800\nPatchens Spencer all right uh who's got the best perception probably it might be Dan I have a four\n\n01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:22.440\noh I think it is leave no I've got 11 Jackson my name is Steve I mean diarrhea I call Spencer\n\n01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:28.680\nJackson because that's because that's what you do when you have 11th perception as a human I don't\n\n01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:34.440\nhave enough perception to find it on my character sheet is that kind of your skills it's alphabetical\n\n01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:43.800\np all right you're looking for Patchens you don't see him shit three that's not bad okay he's uh\n\n01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:50.040\nhe's clearly left the abbey the keep the which way was he headed well he's got to be heading\n\n01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:58.360\ntoward where the thieves went that direction right what no which way was he headed I didn't\n\n01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:07.000\nreally get a good look what do you mean which way was he headed well I did you see him walk off\n\n01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:12.920\nno I left before he did oh great okay where did you see him last right here behind this little\n\n01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:19.000\nbush it's behind this bush I look around around the bush not a bush you're inside I look around\n\n01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:27.720\ninside the bush yeah you see it's like a small nook where a short person could hide I'm really\n\n01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:32.840\nscouring on the level that a person without perception could would achieve the result that\n\n01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:39.400\nhe'd have if he had a high perception um just looking at every fucking inch and centimeter of\n\n01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:47.400\nthe area you see uh fingernail marks like someone was digging into it like uh trying to climb up\n\n01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:58.280\nit or something interesting okay I just yell patch it you do that\n\n01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:07.880\ndon't wonder you guys have like a I can turn into a spirit bird or that's shadow can you\n\n01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:12.760\ntalk to animals there might be something that you guys can do can you conjure one and talk to it and\n\n01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:18.840\nhave it I certainly can't well it looks like we lost passions I mean and I think that anyone\n\n01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:22.920\nlistening would agree that we did the best we could hang on I might be able to conjure up some\n\n01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:32.040\nbullshit here hang on a second I uh I uh I have a bark box can I use bark box for a limited
