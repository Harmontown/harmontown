00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Harmontown starting all the time.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.000
Harmontown is a podcast you can listen to no matter who you are.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
Harmontown the podcast starting now is the time.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
Harmontown is starting now it's starting now.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Harmontown.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Damn.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Nailed it.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
Hello everybody, welcome to Harmontown from the cozy confines of the

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Star Burns Box booth.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
I'm sitting here with Steve Levy, Spencer Crittenden your Game Master.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
I'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Let's give it up for the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Alright, thanks for joining us.

00:45.000 --> 00:53.000
Alright, top item I think for those of our, you know, for anybody who's been like an avid listener

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
as of the last month or so.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
A couple of weeks ago, I don't remember how long ago, we were talking about an

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
encounter you had with Ron Jeremy.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Yes.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
And we, I forgot to address this last week.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Last week we had a gale time and they were like, there's whatever.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm not going to waste time talking about the stuff I didn't get a chance to bring up.

01:14.000 --> 01:23.000
But so to recap the story is that Jeff was at a party and Ron Jeremy walked by him and had a

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
banana peel on his shoulder.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yes.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
And said, and Jeff said, you got a banana peel on your shoulder.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
And Ron Jeremy was like, I know, and walked out.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
So we spent like 20 minutes speculating.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yes.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Like why would, what's the explanation for that?

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
Our first guess collectively, I think, like that we were all very satisfied with was,

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
oh, he walks around with a banana peel on his shoulder because there's some gross kind

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
of like banana in your window that he does for the ladies.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
And Jeff's not like a pretty lady.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
So like he, he wasn't worth it.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
So I got the truth becomes fascinating.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
So somebody on Reddit or somebody sent an AMA or somebody wants to hit like you sent me a

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
thing that somebody went to Ron Jeremy's Reddit page.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
This is the beauty of the internet.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
And let's put a pin in a very temporary pin because I do want to talk about this too.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
It's like, how do we feel about what this guy did?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Because it's like, it's sort of like that's the internet for you.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
Like somebody just blatantly, just bluntly messaged Ron Jeremy and said, Jeff Davis on

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Harmontown said you had an encounter with him and that you seemed mad at him when you're

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
asking about it.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
But you know, it's like, like no, no story is, is it just, it makes you cringe in the

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
retelling.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Like a Larry King reading Eminem lyrics.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
You know, it's like, I didn't mean it that way.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
But this kid says to Ron Jeremy, this happened.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
What do you have to say?

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Ron Jeremy responds.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
It makes me more appealing.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Right.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
So it was our theory was correct except for one fascinating detail, which is that it

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
wasn't pornographic.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
It doesn't have to be though.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
If you're Ron Jeremy, everything you do is pornographic.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Exactly.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
So he had this cutesy like, like Richard scary Mr. Rogers kind of connect.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
So we were essentially right.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Yeah.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Absolutely.

03:20.000 --> 03:27.000
Is his built in joke or admission in that like, I'm not an appealing person.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Like I am not an attractive gentleman.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I'm not.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
And so I'm going to get out in front of that.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I never even thought about it that way.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
I called myself ugly before you did.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
I haven't.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
I'm more appealing than you, than you, you know, now because I have trash on my shoulder.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
So I will say, yeah, remember when we talked about that, how I took a big long chunk aside

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
because I was like, I love my porn.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I love my monsters.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I love my underground people.

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
I hate our societies like hypocritical treatment of, of what we're now calling sex workers.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
But, but, but, and I was like, you know, it's like, I don't, I think we have a very unhealthy

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
relationship with that stuff.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
And like, I, every time I hear that Ron Jeremy was at a party and like so much, you know,

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
someone will make some joke that's like, well, it kind of, you're talking about this person

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
like a second class citizen and stuff.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
It was all wasted effort because, you know, he now, now I can judge him.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
He put a banana peel on his shoulder and the answer was something cute.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
He could have just used it on you.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
He could have just said, it makes me more appealing to you.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
And he, but he didn't.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
And now I like, I'm a little mad at him.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Wait, church, you had a banana before.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Do we ever talk about this?

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
There was bananas involved, but we took them off the table.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Yeah.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Yeah.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Yeah.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I don't know.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
It's like the person that does that, that goes on Reddit and says, hey, he didn't, he

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
or she did not say, hey, Jeff Davis from Harmontown just said Jeff Davis, like that

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
matters to Ron Jeremy.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Okay.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
So Jeff Davis said that you, well, the banana peel and you, you're all pissed off about it.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I don't get the instinct of that person.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Is that, is that someone trying to prove that I made up a story?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
That, yeah.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Okay.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Yeah.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I want to talk about that too because do we love that person or hate that person?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
I don't know.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
I mean, because there was another time and because now someone also, by the way, not to

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
interject is going to now.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Okay.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Now we're talking about it and it's interesting that we're talking about it.

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
Now, now, now two more people will, will message him and go, you have a beef on this

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
thing and something.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
It's a, it's a stupid instinct by stupid people like that.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
However, it got us an answer.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
But, well, but then again, he doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Who's Jeff Davis?

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
He probably was a banana peel around all the goddamn time.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
He didn't know why he had a banana peel on his shoulder.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
He was also engaged in fucking cryptography.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Remember a long, long time ago.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
It took a troll to get to the, to hack and leak the rope, Jeremy leaks.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
In the early, I think the first time I ever even heard of Reddit, I told a story about

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
the neurologist that I worked with who did this crazy thing and somebody went online,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
asked her, did this happen?

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Jeff Davis said that you did this thing and she wrote back, I don't know what you're talking

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
about.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Now either she doesn't remember what, what, what, that she doesn't remember that moment

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
in the way that I and other people in that room remembered that moment.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Wait, can you rewind that a little bit because I don't.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
I did a pilot with a woman who is a neurologist from Boston General.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Oh.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
And we were doing a pilot and it's based on her and there was an actor who was trying to.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Okay, you had a story and somebody during her AMA, okay.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Went, no, no, no emailed her, tracked her down.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
This is pre AMAs.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
Like at least as far as this doctor is concerned, someone just tracked her down and said, hey,

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
this guy, Jeff Davis, the show with you said this thing happened.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Bullshit, right?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
And she's like, I don't know what you're talking about.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
I think he's probably like combining this story and that story.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
The thing is, I remember what happened.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
And also there's, there's five or six people I could track down to absolutely back that

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
up, but she's not going to go online and say, oh yeah, I'm a crazy person.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Like the story is about her being a crazy genius.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Even she didn't remember it because she didn't because she's got bigger fish to fry because

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
she's a neurologist and heals people for a living.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
Or she doesn't want to go out on record saying, oh yeah, I see dead people.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Like I have crazy superpowers.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Right.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
Because she already got like decommissioned ones and had to get locked up for it.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
So the fact that somebody goes out there and tries to debunk this story.

07:40.000 --> 07:48.000
Well, okay, but that's, so like this person that approached Ron Jeremy digitally, you

07:48.000 --> 07:58.000
know, I, it's a, it boils down to like, oh, we wish that they had taken the time to like

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
be more nuanced in their language.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
But really what they were doing was not debunking.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I don't think that they were.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
I think for that.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
You're using an example.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
I get it because like you're saying somebody like fucking actually, you told an interesting

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
story and somebody was like, yeah, but did that ever happen and like ask somebody else?

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
For instance, like one of the first times I went on Reddit was I told the story about

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
my understudy and the king and I getting slapped the shit out of by Gil Brenner.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Now that's a fucking actual story.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
But I went on Reddit like I'm like an idiot, which you really must not do because it's

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
a dent of sadness.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
And I, I went on there and feel like that didn't fucking happen.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
I'm like, dude, I can't even tell my good stories on the air because it's too fucking,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
they're too scandalous.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Like I was there.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
It's a real story, but people think I'm full of shit.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Now, have I exaggerated in the past or maybe fucked up a detail or two?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Of course.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
But the thing is, I don't, when I saw the Ron Jeremy thing, I was like, is it, is that

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
somebody trying to zing me?

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah, I would categorize that person as what they actually, I think they were kind of,

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I think they believed the story.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
And they're fans of us and Ron Jeremy.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
They're fans of us and maybe not so much Ron Jeremy.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
That's the minor problem I have with that person.

09:16.000 --> 09:23.000
It's just, it was just like, well, and look, I'm, do as I, like, I'm, that person, like,

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
they're not a, to me, they're not a villain because it's like,

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
I didn't see villainy in that person doing, I think they were saying like, oh, like,

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I'm on the internet.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I get to ask Ron Jeremy about Harmontown.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
And we would prefer to have so much control over the universe that the way Ron Jeremy hears

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
about that interaction wouldn't come through like a channel that removes all the empathy.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
Because if Ron Jeremy walked in here off the street, we would be nice to him and we would

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
ask him what the hell was going on with the banana peel and there would be humanity involved.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
If he came in here right now, I would ask him about that.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
And I tend to think that it's not a thing he does a lot.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
I don't think that was a, that's a, that's a costume he wears all the time around town.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
He puts a banana peel on the shoulder.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I think he was probably doing some sort of riff.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
He had a banana peel, put it on his shoulder, did a funny joke to somebody left it there.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
But I was a guy, not a girl.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I mean, I just think it was a momentary thing.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
I really don't think Ron Jeremy walks around occasionally or frequently.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
I'm squinting at you.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
You are.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
Subscribers can see if you choose to pay us $5 a month to watch the podcast.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
You can see that I'm squinting at you.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Dan, nobody's subscribing anymore.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
They'll stop listening when we stop having.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Well, I'm trying, I'm trying to change that by squinting at you.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Okay, well.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
So I'm trying to add an element to the podcast that requires $5.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Should I just book Ron Jeremy and get to the bottom of this?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Sure.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
I know.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
For $5 a month, you could see Dan casting me a jaundiced eye.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
Only because in your defense, kind of, I guess.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I think I'm just giving him the big benefit of the doubt.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
His response to that kid saying, what's that story about being like one line?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
It makes me more appealing.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
It felt a little confident.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
But here's the thing.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Ron Jeremy and I do not share.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
We're not cousins on the spectrum.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
So I guess I can't compare his behavior to mine in that situation because I would have

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
been like, my response would have been eight paragraphs long had that been like a, I would

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
have gone, okay, here's the thing.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
There was a banana peel on the table and I started to put it and I started doing this

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
joke and then I was like, I was walking around with it and I wanted to go and I didn't want

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
to take it off and then put it back on.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
I would have all this fucking like, or I would go like, you know what?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
I was horny that night and I was like doing this thing and it was getting some action.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
And then I was like tired and I don't remember your friend, whoever you're talking about,

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
blah, blah, blah.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
It would have been a hyperverbal response, which by the way, how does that get me more

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
results than Ron Jeremy is getting?

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
I guess the only thing I have nothing to do.

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
Because all I did was harmlessly ask a Ron Jeremy that was four feet away from me who

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
just passed me wearing a banana, a spent banana peel over his shoulder.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
I said, pardon me, sir, you have a banana peel on your shoulder.

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
And the only reaction that is confusing is him to go, yeah, thanks.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
It's funny because it's not funny in the moment.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
That's why it's funny because it's like, you could have just said it makes me more appealing

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
and I think maybe I think that's him.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
Because if I were a cute girl, he might have gone, well, does it make me more appealing

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
and then what?

12:41.000 --> 12:49.000
Well, also, if you're a guy, as you are, and you go, excuse me, you got a banana peel

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
on your shoulder and if he stopped and said, it makes me more appealing, you might have

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
gone gross.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Is that how you get laid?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Fuck.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
My dick's bigger than yours.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
What are you trying to pull?

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
It would have been vulnerable.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I would never have gone that far.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
I know you wouldn't have.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
The phantom of his father might have gone that far.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Let's role play.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Who do I get to be?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
No wrong answers.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
You're on Jeremy, but give me the reply that he did, like respond.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
No, no, give me, it makes me more appealing, like do the fun version of that.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Sir, you have a banana peel on your shoulder.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
It makes me more appealing.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Oh, you little devil.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
That would have been my response.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah, thank you because a guy outside the bathroom, I said that and he made fun of me.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
He said, you think that's funny?

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
You're a piece of shit and then he said some horrible shit about a movie I was in in 1972

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
and then he made fun of my body, which is always on display in my work.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I got this half bottle of champagne.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
You want some?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Are you sticking around?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
I'd love some.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
What's your name?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
I'm Ron Jeremy.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
I'm Jeff.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
It's nice to meet you.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Thank you.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
You know what?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
I get scared of being vulnerable with people because I'm a public figure and it's really

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
easy to make fun of me.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
You know, but here's the beauty of you wearing a banana peel on your shoulder.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
For me, if you just walked by, I wouldn't have said anything.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
I would have said to my girlfriend, oh shit, Ron Jeremy just walked by.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
But because you had a gimmick or whether you're doing a bit or like a thing or whatever,

14:16.000 --> 14:22.000
like I got to say something to Ron Jeremy because there was a specific thing happening.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
And you're saying it kind of in a literal sense made me more appealing.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Well, it made you more accessible.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Right.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
It didn't make me more appealing.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
That's my concern was that I did it for...

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Can I ask you a question?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Who's your champagne?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Oh, thank you.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Cheers.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Yeah.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Clink.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
I say clink because we're drinking out of paper cups, but that's me being less appealing.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
I don't know.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
Can I ask you three questions about the banana peel?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
I trust you.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Yeah.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Okay.

14:54.000 --> 15:00.000
What's the origin story of that banana peel being on your right shoulder?

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
My uncle Kurt used to do it.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
I love uncle Kurt.

15:07.000 --> 15:14.000
And he was actually in our family, like the running joke was that he had a really, really

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
small penis.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
I grew up in a very liberal family.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
I was a child of the 40s.

15:22.000 --> 15:30.000
You know, back then there was a counterculture that wasn't as publicized as in the 60s, but

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
I grew up on a ranch surrounded by hippies and things.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
I'll stop you.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
I've read your biography.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Oh, okay.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
All right.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Oh, you've...

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I've never heard the Kurt story.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I know your whole childhood.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Well, he's one of the few family members that actually...

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
Yeah, he passed away before he could approve of the biography, but everyone else I checked

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
it out with.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
That's very thoughtful of you.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
A lot of people don't even consider it.

15:55.000 --> 16:01.120
Uncle Kurt was, yeah, the smallest penis, but the thing that always moved me about him

16:01.120 --> 16:04.440
was that he...

16:04.440 --> 16:07.600
Everyone liked him more.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.600
And I always...

16:09.600 --> 16:11.600
Because he had a banana peel on his shoulder?

16:11.600 --> 16:13.560
No, because he did clever things like that.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.320
That was something that stuck out in my head when I was eight years old.

16:16.320 --> 16:20.600
The thing that stuck out in general about uncle Kurt was that he had this very tiny little

16:20.600 --> 16:22.640
itty-bitty little wiener.

16:22.640 --> 16:28.600
And I don't know if it was because of that, that he was such a socially graceful person,

16:28.600 --> 16:32.920
or I don't know how much of it had to do with the fact that, frankly, from the age of three

16:32.920 --> 16:39.000
forward, my earliest memories as Ron Jeremy are people telling me I had a huge, weirdly

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
huge dick.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.720
Like, even before I knew what sex was, people were commenting about my big, giant dick.

16:44.720 --> 16:49.240
Now, is uncle Kurt wearing the banana peel because of his small dick?

16:49.240 --> 16:51.160
Is there a correlation there?

16:51.160 --> 16:56.400
No, I mean, for me, what I'm saying to you is, it was a thing that he would do, and when

16:56.400 --> 16:59.520
I went to that party that night, there was bananas everywhere.

16:59.520 --> 17:03.680
There were, because I saw people, yeah, peaches had a banana, which is already funny.

17:03.680 --> 17:07.360
It was one of a million things that he would do, and I just kind of started doing it, and

17:07.360 --> 17:11.640
I actually immediately started getting results, and it was really satisfying to me.

17:11.640 --> 17:19.000
And the moment when you interacted with me, I was actually starting to come down from

17:19.000 --> 17:27.800
it because I had said just before I ran into you to a younger woman, you know, it makes

17:27.800 --> 17:28.800
me more appealing.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.360
She's like, that's funny.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.920
Like people say you're a porn star.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.760
She was so young, she didn't know, and I was like, yeah, I'm a porn star, but I'm also

17:35.760 --> 17:36.760
a human being.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.200
And she was like, yeah, but why?

17:39.200 --> 17:43.480
It went south really fast in a way that made me think that if I had been born with a smaller

17:43.480 --> 17:47.680
dick, at that moment, I might have met the woman of my dreams because I was overhearing

17:47.680 --> 17:54.680
her at the table by the champagne, and I was like, I love this girl, and I felt like I

17:54.680 --> 18:01.160
was locked in a box from birth by my giant cock, and the banana peel couldn't break me

18:01.160 --> 18:02.160
out of it.

18:02.160 --> 18:06.800
And then I walked past you, and you said, and honestly, I don't remember the encounter,

18:06.800 --> 18:08.240
but I'm telling you why that probably happened.

18:08.240 --> 18:11.800
I was on my way to my car, I didn't want to pull the banana peel off, because it would

18:11.800 --> 18:16.520
look like a defeat, but I was just on my way to my car, and I just wanted to go home and

18:16.520 --> 18:19.480
like just where I where I gained strength in isolation.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.680
But when I asked you, you said, oh, it's making me more appealing.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.920
This is not the version where you where you snapped it.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.920
Like, do you do you sometimes snap it?

18:25.920 --> 18:26.920
Oh, oh, shit.

18:26.920 --> 18:27.920
Yeah, I'm sorry.

18:27.920 --> 18:28.920
I forgot.

18:28.920 --> 18:29.920
No, I have.

18:29.920 --> 18:30.920
Sorry.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.720
Wait, so now you're saying that sometimes I snap it people.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.920
This is something that you do frequently.

18:35.920 --> 18:36.920
Okay.

18:36.920 --> 18:43.480
Now, if you're doing it frequently, what's what's the what's the blue sky version of

18:43.480 --> 18:45.200
like only women asking you about it?

18:45.200 --> 18:46.200
Like what?

18:46.200 --> 18:47.200
I was caught up in a moment.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.200
That's what I'm saying.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.200
It's not a thing that I do.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.200
It's not my gimmick.

18:50.200 --> 18:54.080
It was something that I started doing that I am familiar with that I got into Spencer.

18:54.080 --> 19:00.640
What's your take on the banana gate?

19:00.640 --> 19:01.640
What?

19:01.640 --> 19:02.640
Yeah.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.640
I had a I could have.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.640
I could have.

19:04.640 --> 19:05.640
I could have.

19:05.640 --> 19:09.000
I could have put that in an envelope and what's your what's my take on?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.960
I don't think that sentence finished.

19:10.960 --> 19:18.600
Well, what do you think the backstory of the Ron Jeremy banana peel shoulder thing is?

19:18.600 --> 19:20.000
Is that a one off?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.040
Is that a thing he does?

19:22.040 --> 19:27.800
And why was he so I mean, he wasn't pissed off at me.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.960
He just I think you guys got the to the answers already.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.480
I think he's done it a few times.

19:32.480 --> 19:36.800
I think he doesn't get anything about it by playing along with a male.

19:36.800 --> 19:41.440
I hope it's not the fact that he's trying to get out in front of you calling him an

19:41.440 --> 19:46.640
ugly because the banana peel I think that's no, I don't I don't think I think that's

19:46.640 --> 19:48.200
you reading too far into it.

19:48.200 --> 19:50.160
I think that anyone can be more appealing.

19:50.160 --> 19:54.400
They don't have to necessarily think they're disgusting to have to say, oh, I could be

19:54.400 --> 19:55.400
more appealing.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.760
But did he like he could have had a bad night?

19:57.760 --> 20:02.960
I was like, I see stuff retweeted that I've said to some kid that I had an encounter with

20:02.960 --> 20:04.280
and I'm like, well, that's not me.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.560
I hope that doesn't represent me.

20:05.560 --> 20:10.800
He is having a bad night, but I mean, we can't assume that he has a trunk of banana peels

20:10.800 --> 20:11.800
in his car.

20:11.800 --> 20:12.800
Yeah.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.920
No, it's like a bar trick.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.360
Wasn't there a crazy Cody story you wanted to tell?

20:17.360 --> 20:20.160
What are you, my publicist?

20:20.160 --> 20:21.160
Yeah.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.760
Well, you kind of are.

20:22.760 --> 20:23.760
Yeah.

20:23.760 --> 20:24.760
Yeah.

20:24.760 --> 20:25.760
Well, okay.

20:25.760 --> 20:26.760
This is yes.

20:26.760 --> 20:29.360
You told me to remind you last week because you didn't get to it.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.000
I told you to remind me.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Yeah, you're like, I want to talk about that on the podcast.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
That doesn't sound like me.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.880
Yeah, you'd remember something like that.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.360
I do have, yes, it's written down here.

20:41.360 --> 20:42.960
I didn't need that.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.200
That's what's important.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.200
Okay.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.720
Thank you.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.720
Here's the thing.

20:50.720 --> 20:59.240
I recently got a text message from a writer on Great Minds who I texted and said, am I,

20:59.240 --> 21:00.960
do you want me to give you anonymity?

21:00.960 --> 21:01.960
He doesn't care.

21:01.960 --> 21:07.400
Because it's about, this is about marijuana, doesn't matter to him.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.640
But Andrew Weinberg is writer on Great Minds, remember Andrew?

21:10.640 --> 21:11.640
Yeah.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.200
He was a guest on the show.

21:14.200 --> 21:24.520
He texted me and said, I just came back from the weed store and this is the bag they gave

21:24.520 --> 21:26.880
me my weed in.

21:26.880 --> 21:32.240
And he texted me a photo of the bag that they gave to put his weed in when he left the weed

21:32.240 --> 21:33.240
store.

21:33.240 --> 21:42.800
And on the bag was written, wait, why, am I distracted by, okay.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.880
What's in the bag?

21:44.880 --> 21:45.960
What's in the bag is a bunch of weed.

21:45.960 --> 21:46.960
Who cares?

21:46.960 --> 21:47.960
What's on the bag?

21:47.960 --> 21:51.200
What's on the bag is he takes me a photo of it.

21:51.200 --> 21:58.680
My girlfriend, it says Cody Heller and her phone number with area code.

21:58.680 --> 22:04.480
Her address, her email address, everything.

22:04.480 --> 22:13.160
Every conceivable thing you could learn about a human being without dumpster diving was about

22:13.160 --> 22:18.960
my girlfriend was written on this paper bag that had been given his product in.

22:18.960 --> 22:22.320
And he was sending me a photo because he just happened to know, even though I wasn't going

22:22.320 --> 22:25.360
out with, or I guess I was going out with Cody during Great Minds.

22:25.360 --> 22:34.360
But he, he's like, this is what they gave me and I'm like, oh, okay, so then one of

22:34.360 --> 22:40.680
the phrases written on the bag was lamb's bread, which is a flavor of vape that Cody

22:40.680 --> 22:41.680
is obsessed with.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.640
She loves lamb's bread.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.200
Why is, what?

22:45.200 --> 22:46.360
Obviously what happened.

22:46.360 --> 22:56.400
Not obviously, but a quick, you know, think tank session, put this together.

22:56.400 --> 22:59.960
This is a dispensary that Cody had been on the phone with.

22:59.960 --> 23:05.120
She, this lamb's bread flavor has been discontinued.

23:05.120 --> 23:10.360
I mean, she's, I really haven't seen anyone as obsessed about this stuff since like Justin

23:10.360 --> 23:15.200
talked about like, I don't know, police academy action figures or something.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.360
Like, like, like she just had this obsession.

23:17.360 --> 23:22.480
Like she just, she found this vape flavor that she loves lamb's bread.

23:22.480 --> 23:25.720
It was just, she was calling around to a lot of dispensaries.

23:25.720 --> 23:30.320
And then it was also, oh, also written on the bag was like, you can tell the story,

23:30.320 --> 23:33.240
even if you didn't have inside information, you could slowly figure it out because one

23:33.240 --> 23:39.120
of the things was something like willing to pay, willing to buy a thousand dollars worth

23:39.120 --> 23:40.120
or something.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.360
It was like some form of that.

23:41.360 --> 23:45.600
So Cody obviously called this place and was like, what's up with lamb's bread?

23:45.600 --> 23:48.280
I got to get more lamb's bread.

23:48.280 --> 23:55.640
My name is Cody Heller here's, and they, and they're like, oh shit, let me use the,

23:55.640 --> 24:01.160
the pot head equivalent of a database, which is writing on a bag next to the cash register

24:01.160 --> 24:06.800
all of your information because wow, that's a lot of, that's a lot of pot vape we could

24:06.800 --> 24:07.800
sell.

24:07.800 --> 24:11.400
It happened that someone that you know went in and got that bag.

24:11.400 --> 24:12.400
It just so happens.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.400
It just so happens.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.400
That's fucking nuts.

24:14.400 --> 24:18.640
Well, that's the, if Republicans are listening, it's like, okay, now you can use this as an

24:18.640 --> 24:21.720
example of like, let's not legalize marijuana.

24:21.720 --> 24:26.440
However, I'm way ahead of you because it's like, no, let's legalize it so much that

24:26.440 --> 24:32.440
we can have pay really high wages to people that have like super sophisticated computer

24:32.440 --> 24:34.760
systems when they're selling you your pot.

24:34.760 --> 24:39.480
But the punchline comes because I'm like, holy shit, my girlfriend was like inadvertently

24:39.480 --> 24:51.360
doxxed by this, you know, trusted weed vendor and, um, fuck, I gotta the, and I was, I was

24:51.360 --> 24:54.640
explained, I'm like, Jesus Christ, I'm trying to get to the bottom and I'm like, oh fuck,

24:54.640 --> 24:56.280
man, that's, that's crazy.

24:56.280 --> 24:59.200
Like if it hadn't been you, then there's just a stranger out there with all your personal

24:59.200 --> 25:03.960
information written on their weed bag and that's just, that's just bad form.

25:03.960 --> 25:04.960
Yeah.

25:04.960 --> 25:08.160
But, and then I'm like, oh, she's gonna be bummed out about this, but I have to tell

25:08.160 --> 25:09.160
her.

25:09.160 --> 25:16.600
Um, and, uh, and I, and I texted the photo and the story to Cody and her response, her

25:16.600 --> 25:21.280
immediate first response was, oh no, if they don't have my info, I'm not gonna get my

25:21.280 --> 25:22.280
lamb's bread.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.280
Ha, ha, ha.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.280
Manant, manant, manant.

25:24.280 --> 25:25.280
What do you think?

25:25.280 --> 25:26.280
Why is it called lamb's bread?

25:26.280 --> 25:27.280
Yeah.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.280
What do you think lamb's bread is?

25:28.280 --> 25:33.440
It's just a flavor of, no, I know, but like if, if I exist, well, once upon a time there

25:33.440 --> 25:36.000
was a strain called God's breath.

25:36.000 --> 25:41.760
I believe it might have been a relative to God's gift, but God's breath happened and

25:41.760 --> 25:44.280
it got changed to God's bread over time.

25:44.280 --> 25:50.200
It kind of got bread into God's bread and then God's bread colloquially got renamed

25:50.200 --> 25:54.000
lamb's bread in some circles or was bread into lamb's bread.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.440
So it's, it's God's breath kind of bastardized three generations or so.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.480
I can't believe you actually know the answer to that.

26:01.480 --> 26:04.600
The only reason I know you're not making it up is because you'd never put the energy

26:04.600 --> 26:05.600
into it.

26:05.600 --> 26:09.160
Like you'd, you wouldn't, you wouldn't see the, you wouldn't see the point in lying,

26:09.160 --> 26:10.160
but you could be lying.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.480
You could be making all of that up.

26:11.480 --> 26:12.480
Right.

26:12.480 --> 26:13.480
Well, it's true.

26:13.480 --> 26:21.000
Spencer, like I've never seen you this nervous before because we'd learned earlier that Spencer's

26:21.000 --> 26:23.800
new least Honda CRV.

26:23.800 --> 26:27.400
He's already gone over his monthly allotment of miles for his lease.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.400
Yeah.

26:28.400 --> 26:35.000
I got a new car and I had it for like a week and I got like a cheese stain in the car.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.400
Don't worry about the cheese stain.

26:37.400 --> 26:38.400
We're about to,

26:38.400 --> 26:39.400
Well, it's just,

26:39.400 --> 26:40.400
That doesn't matter.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.400
Don't want to just

26:41.400 --> 26:42.400
Fuck you guys.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.400
You don't know what doesn't matter.

26:43.400 --> 26:44.400
You're fine.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.400
Every day it's like Macbeth.

26:45.400 --> 26:50.040
I'm going to fucking kill myself because I look in and see this faint grease stain in

26:50.040 --> 26:53.000
the car that I know came from cheese.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.160
What, what sort of cheese?

26:54.160 --> 26:55.160
What was the

26:55.160 --> 26:56.160
Shatter cheese.

26:56.160 --> 26:57.840
From what kind of like meal were you having?

26:57.840 --> 27:01.480
A bag of cheddar cheese, I wasn't eating a bag of cheddar cheese, but it was from a bag

27:01.480 --> 27:02.480
of cheddar cheese.

27:02.480 --> 27:03.480
Was it melted cheese?

27:03.480 --> 27:04.480
No.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.480
It was just cheese.

27:05.480 --> 27:06.480
But the oil got out.

27:06.480 --> 27:07.480
Yeah.

27:07.480 --> 27:08.480
It's a greasy item.

27:08.480 --> 27:09.480
Greasy cheese.

27:09.480 --> 27:10.480
Right.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.480
Greasy cheese.

27:11.480 --> 27:14.120
Why did you have unwrapped cheese on your car seat?

27:14.120 --> 27:16.560
Well, I don't know how it got on the car seat.

27:16.560 --> 27:24.040
They're multiple competing theories, including my favorite is Jeff put it on the car seat.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.800
There's no reason to believe that that's true.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.760
But have you calculated the worst case scenario?

27:27.760 --> 27:31.800
Because what you're going through is like, you're, you're not to condescend to you because

27:31.800 --> 27:37.360
I'm lower than you on the consumer scale because you drive me everywhere.

27:37.360 --> 27:42.160
But you're younger than me and I have bought cars, but not least them.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.160
I've bought you, whatever.

27:43.160 --> 27:47.920
I've, I've been through a lot of apartments and had my security deposit at stake because

27:47.920 --> 27:52.720
I hung up, hung up picture and oh no, there's a hole in the wall.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.440
That shame that fills you.

27:54.440 --> 27:58.720
Have you, have you, have you gone to the point in confronting that shame where you've

27:58.720 --> 28:03.400
calculated like the worst case scenario about leasing a Honda CRV and having a cheese stain

28:03.400 --> 28:04.400
backseat?

28:04.400 --> 28:06.960
Like what's the worst that could happen to you?

28:06.960 --> 28:11.400
Uh, I'd be on the hook for multiple thousands of dollars and I'd have a cheese stain in

28:11.400 --> 28:12.400
my car.

28:12.400 --> 28:16.680
Well, what do you, but go through, I mean, what happens because if, if, if this is a

28:16.680 --> 28:23.160
company that, that leases you a car and tells you, by the way, we expect you to never cheese

28:23.160 --> 28:24.160
stain the seat.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.720
It's not because of the lease.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.040
It's because it's a new car.

28:27.040 --> 28:30.320
Oh, are you just bummed out because you feel like you just got a new car and it's already

28:30.320 --> 28:32.520
starting to look like your old car that you love?

28:32.520 --> 28:34.360
Yeah, there's a giant fucking cheese stain.

28:34.360 --> 28:39.040
Oh, well, then let's, let me shower you with fucking like, are you kidding me?

28:39.040 --> 28:42.000
That's fucking like, that's fantastic.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.720
That's, that's Spencer juice.

28:43.720 --> 28:44.720
That's, that's, that's.

28:44.720 --> 28:45.720
No, that's why.

28:45.720 --> 28:46.720
It's terrible.

28:46.720 --> 28:47.720
Uh, because you're, yeah.

28:47.720 --> 28:49.040
No, because it's cheese.

28:49.040 --> 28:50.040
I know, because.

28:50.040 --> 28:54.400
But it's like, it might as well have been a D&D stain.

28:54.400 --> 28:58.840
Have you tried to get some, like, some shout or something like that and get it all out?

28:58.840 --> 29:02.960
I'm probably about $200 deep in trying to solve this problem.

29:02.960 --> 29:03.960
Oh no.

29:03.960 --> 29:04.960
What kind of cheese?

29:04.960 --> 29:05.960
Cheezus.

29:05.960 --> 29:09.160
Is it, is it $200 cheese stain?

29:09.160 --> 29:15.120
This is a, I don't want to dismiss that road, but I was like, like, like also though, because

29:15.120 --> 29:19.160
I resonate with this, like, you're thinking like you got this new car and it's like, it's

29:19.160 --> 29:20.600
like a grown-up car, right?

29:20.600 --> 29:23.960
Like you're like a child and you got like a grown-up car and you saw the cheese stain

29:23.960 --> 29:26.920
and you're like, oh, I'm already doing it wrong.

29:26.920 --> 29:31.560
Like I didn't, I didn't do what my mom would do or like what a grown-up does or like what

29:31.560 --> 29:35.000
your favorite cop character on TV would do.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Like, like.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Right.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Adam Sandberg.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Ben Hitchcock.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Adam Sandberg.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.320
He loves getting his name mixed up with Adam Sandler.

29:44.320 --> 29:49.240
Adam Sandberg's cop-cop car wouldn't have cheese stains, first of all, I doubt that.

29:49.240 --> 29:52.680
I'm sure if that's a lovable sick one, probably has some cheese stains.

29:52.680 --> 29:53.680
This resonates with me.

29:53.680 --> 30:00.200
Like if I put myself in your shoes or your car, my OCD, I would never not notice the

30:00.200 --> 30:01.200
cheese stain.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.200
No, I know.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.080
I can literally feel it in the back of my head when I'm driving.

30:05.080 --> 30:08.000
I can feel it behind me in the seat.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.680
Like I just, it's not my seat, like it's in the back seat, but I just, its presence is

30:13.680 --> 30:15.320
there and undeniable.

30:15.320 --> 30:18.880
But you pick me up for work every day and drive me everywhere and you-

30:18.880 --> 30:23.280
And I'm on the verge of killing us both because of this cheese stain.

30:23.280 --> 30:27.840
And I would accept that if you were to, if we got to heaven and you would say, I'm sorry

30:27.840 --> 30:32.000
man, I had a cheese stain and I had to, what was life worth and I was like, that's why

30:32.000 --> 30:36.840
you swerved into oncoming traffic and I'd be like, you know what, better reason to die

30:36.840 --> 30:44.560
than because we elected a dyslexic fucking stroked out, humonculus.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.440
Humonculus?

30:46.440 --> 30:50.960
I would say take the Honda back to the Honda dealership and say, look, I got this fucking

30:50.960 --> 30:52.240
cheese stain back here.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.440
It's driving me crazy.

30:53.440 --> 30:56.280
Do you guys, they'll know how to get the cheese stain out.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.280
I've thought about that.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.200
I've taken it to get detailed, but-

30:59.200 --> 31:04.120
Can I be the other devil on your shoulder because there's no angel in this equation?

31:04.120 --> 31:08.720
Can I take another bag of cheese and fucking rub it all over that thing?

31:08.720 --> 31:11.880
Or not, that was, that's Dino if you would hear him.

31:11.880 --> 31:18.720
I'm saying like this, the solution isn't to avoid cheese stains because that creates

31:18.720 --> 31:22.920
an economy, a psychological economy where you're like, then you're always one cheese

31:22.920 --> 31:25.960
stain away from being deregulated.

31:25.960 --> 31:31.920
The solution is to actually accept the cheese stain because then that helps you cope with

31:31.920 --> 31:33.160
like reality.

31:33.160 --> 31:37.000
The first time I leased a car, I obsessed about it so much and the first time I got

31:37.000 --> 31:41.320
a little nick like somebody opened their door into my door and there's a little ding there,

31:41.320 --> 31:43.680
it drove me fucking crazy because I-

31:43.680 --> 31:44.680
I remember.

31:44.680 --> 31:48.440
I wanted that thing to be perfect and now like having leased a bunch of cars, you don't

31:48.440 --> 31:49.440
give a shit.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.440
They don't give a shit.

31:50.440 --> 31:55.920
When Jeff got his first Lexus, like, yeah, you weren't a dick or anything, but it was

31:55.920 --> 31:56.920
like-

31:56.920 --> 31:57.920
No, I was-

31:57.920 --> 31:58.920
It fucking eclipsed his life.

31:58.920 --> 31:59.920
It was like he had a-

31:59.920 --> 32:03.840
Yeah, I only had shitty cars before that, I only had cars that were covered in cheese

32:03.840 --> 32:04.840
stains like the whole-

32:04.840 --> 32:08.560
And it wasn't because you became a materialist, it was because-

32:08.560 --> 32:09.560
I felt like an adult for the first time.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.240
It was because you felt like you were fucking up adulting.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.240
Yeah.

32:13.240 --> 32:16.760
I know exactly- that's first day of school for everybody.

32:16.760 --> 32:20.680
You just get this big chance and you lay out your pants and your binders and all that

32:20.680 --> 32:24.960
stuff and then the first time it's like, oh, my homework's got bubble gum on it and then

32:24.960 --> 32:29.600
we just go like, God fucking damn it, I knew it, I knew I'm a piece of shit, I knew it!

32:29.600 --> 32:32.680
Yeah, you hear your mother's voice in your head yelling at you for fucking up.

32:32.680 --> 32:38.560
That's why I'm mad, it's not because of any of- else, it's not like the practical struggles

32:38.560 --> 32:42.000
of a stain, like that's literally the only reason why I'm mad.

32:42.000 --> 32:47.160
That's what I want to address to help you feel better because first step that makes

32:47.160 --> 32:51.080
you 90% feel better is talking about it because as soon as it comes out of your mouth you

32:51.080 --> 32:59.200
know it's like- and then the next 10% is us going like, yeah, man, me too, me too.

32:59.200 --> 33:02.640
I was pretty impressed that you had a new car until I found out it's the fucking cheese

33:02.640 --> 33:03.640
stain car.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.640
I know.

33:05.640 --> 33:08.760
Outside of the cheese stain though, how do you like that car?

33:08.760 --> 33:09.760
It's fine.

33:09.760 --> 33:11.720
He likes it so much, he's going over his miles!

33:11.720 --> 33:18.560
Oh man, it's the mileage- the idea of a mileage cap bummed me out.

33:18.560 --> 33:27.160
I haven't had a car since it gave my Prius to McGathey and the divorce and I don't need

33:27.160 --> 33:28.800
to drive anywhere apparently.

33:28.800 --> 33:29.800
I found that out.

33:29.800 --> 33:34.320
Well, Spencer does and he's going to kill himself.

33:34.320 --> 33:39.560
Do you get sick of me- are you looking forward to me not needing a ride everywhere?

33:39.560 --> 33:46.360
I think that the scheduled demands that sometimes arise from the worst case scenarios of having

33:46.360 --> 33:52.720
to drive you around can be a hassle, but the actual driving of you around is not a hassle.

33:52.720 --> 33:57.040
That's all fine and good, but sometimes it's like, well, it means I got to get up and leave

33:57.040 --> 34:02.840
the house at eight and then I might be on the hook until eight or something at night.

34:02.840 --> 34:07.200
That's where the problems come in, but especially lately that's never been the case.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.560
We've been really easy going lately.

34:09.560 --> 34:16.440
I am looking forward to- well, because also in my own personal schedule I've made a decision

34:16.440 --> 34:20.120
that I'm like, I'm going to pull back and take it easy with the workaholism a little

34:20.120 --> 34:21.120
bit.

34:21.120 --> 34:24.960
That probably affects it a little, where I'm like, I don't mind.

34:24.960 --> 34:30.880
We also have been- by the way, for those of you who joined us in the beginning, and we

34:30.880 --> 34:38.360
haven't explained it, Jeff and Church are doing a hands-made tail cosplay.

34:38.360 --> 34:43.160
We explained that while the audio was out and then Jeff- Jeff had come in and sat down

34:43.160 --> 34:49.320
and for the last 30 minutes, Jeff has been with a completely straight face just being

34:49.320 --> 34:55.880
Jeff and he has this fucking ridiculous beard.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.600
It's pretty funny, but that's- I mean, my beard is itchy because it's fake and I've

34:58.600 --> 35:04.240
got spirit gum on, there's mesh, but how do you guys- you guys all have beards.

35:04.240 --> 35:05.240
It's terrible.

35:05.240 --> 35:08.560
You're wearing a big old thing on your face all the time, it's like I want to blow my

35:08.560 --> 35:09.560
brains out.

35:09.560 --> 35:10.560
My grandmother hit me too.

35:10.560 --> 35:11.560
She yells at me.

35:11.560 --> 35:12.560
Oh yeah?

35:12.560 --> 35:13.560
Oh yeah.

35:13.560 --> 35:16.080
Wait, wait, because- Because kissing you is less essential?

35:16.080 --> 35:17.080
No.

35:17.080 --> 35:22.320
Because men with beards are inherently less handsome.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.800
It's like an old way of thinking.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.000
She's like, you guys are gross.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.600
Did you tell her that old women are less attractive?

35:29.600 --> 35:30.600
No.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.600
No.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.720
Well, then that's called privilege.

35:33.720 --> 35:35.440
You could just kick back and enjoy it.

35:35.440 --> 35:40.320
She's like, yeah, grandma, you got it, I'm a real ugly piece of shit.

35:40.320 --> 35:42.520
Wank-wank to God.

35:42.520 --> 35:43.520
Every other-

35:43.520 --> 35:49.960
Your paper flesh isn't gross at all, no one has a right to shame you for that because

35:49.960 --> 35:52.560
it's not a choice, you're just melting.

35:52.560 --> 35:57.600
She's being old school because Jewish Paul Newman wouldn't have a beard.

35:57.600 --> 35:58.600
I'm sorry, I-

35:58.600 --> 35:59.920
Paul Newman was Jewish.

35:59.920 --> 36:04.360
Yeah, but you're like the Jewish Paul Newman.

36:04.360 --> 36:09.120
Paul Newman could never be as Jewish as you, no matter how hard he tried.

36:09.120 --> 36:13.360
I don't think he went to temple as much as you did.

36:13.360 --> 36:16.160
He goes, he probably went to temple more than me.

36:16.160 --> 36:17.760
Did you love your grandma?

36:17.760 --> 36:18.760
Yeah, she's great.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.480
Do you think she's an attractive person?

36:21.480 --> 36:23.360
Like, physically?

36:23.360 --> 36:25.360
Yeah, she went there.

36:25.360 --> 36:26.360
Oh, come on.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.360
Okay.

36:27.360 --> 36:28.360
Don't do that to me.

36:28.360 --> 36:29.360
No.

36:29.360 --> 36:30.360
Don't do that to her.

36:30.360 --> 36:31.360
Don't do that to you.

36:31.360 --> 36:34.920
How about we live in a society where reason is God and rule of law governs the land.

36:34.920 --> 36:35.920
She wants me to get-

36:35.920 --> 36:39.080
And we don't judge people by whether they're like, why are grandma's grandfathered in?

36:39.080 --> 36:41.080
Well, that's because they're grandmas.

36:41.080 --> 36:44.080
It's like, oh, you're so cute.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.080
You know what?

36:45.080 --> 36:48.880
I wonder how much of the fucking patriarch is upheld by grandmas who are like, oh, you're

36:48.880 --> 36:49.880
so attractive.

36:49.880 --> 36:50.880
All of it.

36:50.880 --> 36:51.880
When are you going to get married?

36:51.880 --> 36:52.880
When are you going to look better?

36:52.880 --> 36:54.360
Why don't you show some leg?

36:54.360 --> 36:56.480
Grandmas sound like Don Draper.

36:56.480 --> 37:00.480
Oh, the specter of inequality is-

37:00.480 --> 37:05.360
We went to church, took me to Adam Levine's annual Halloween party, and I carried around

37:05.360 --> 37:10.960
dressed as Commander Fred from Handmaid's Tale with my Scrabble Box.

37:10.960 --> 37:14.320
And I think only four people laughed at that.

37:14.320 --> 37:15.320
Were there a lot of-

37:15.320 --> 37:19.680
I think there was an early prediction that that was going to be, that Halloween was going

37:19.680 --> 37:22.320
to be like an army of Handmaids.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.520
I've seen three, and I've been to numerous parties.

37:25.520 --> 37:27.600
Yeah, Ricky Lindholm was there.

37:27.600 --> 37:33.200
Ricky from Garfunkel, from Garfunkel and Oates.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.880
She was there as a Handmaid, and there was a couple others.

37:35.880 --> 37:39.640
There was a couple who were the Commander and the Commander's wife who had a blow-up

37:39.640 --> 37:40.640
doll dressed as a Handmaid.

37:40.640 --> 37:41.640
In between them?

37:41.640 --> 37:42.640
Oh, boy.

37:42.640 --> 37:43.640
They kept fucking it.

37:43.640 --> 37:44.640
It was really good.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.800
I have so many questions about that show.

37:46.800 --> 37:47.800
I was surprised.

37:47.800 --> 37:48.800
I can tell you what.

37:48.800 --> 37:49.800
How many people were at that party?

37:49.800 --> 37:50.800
A few hundred?

37:50.800 --> 37:51.800
No.

37:51.800 --> 37:52.800
More like a thousand.

37:52.800 --> 37:53.800
Okay.

37:53.800 --> 37:59.440
And I didn't- I was surprised I didn't see any Rick and Morty costumes.

37:59.440 --> 38:02.200
But that's kind of a Hollywood rock and roller.

38:02.200 --> 38:04.400
We did see them at Luchovim.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.400
Well, I mean-

38:05.400 --> 38:06.400
Yeah.

38:06.400 --> 38:07.400
I got texted a hundred pictures of people.

38:07.400 --> 38:08.400
Okay, good.

38:08.400 --> 38:12.360
Because I was like, I remember the year when there were none, and then the year when there

38:12.360 --> 38:16.080
were a thousand, and I don't know, within that year.

38:16.080 --> 38:17.080
I don't know.

38:17.080 --> 38:18.840
Yeah, if it was like-

38:18.840 --> 38:21.120
It's gotta be one of the most popular costumes this year.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.120
But you know what there is?

38:22.120 --> 38:23.520
Harmon Quest costumes.

38:23.520 --> 38:24.520
Oh, yeah.

38:24.520 --> 38:30.920
Well, at the Starburns party that we had, there were literally- because the entire art department

38:30.920 --> 38:36.040
of Harmon Quest, like they coordinated, there was an army of Spencers, I'm sure you already

38:36.040 --> 38:37.040
know that right now.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.040
Yeah.

38:38.040 --> 38:41.240
But do you feel better or worse about not coming to the party?

38:41.240 --> 38:42.240
Worse.

38:42.240 --> 38:44.440
I tried to go to the party.

38:44.440 --> 38:46.040
I tried to go three times.

38:46.040 --> 38:49.040
But Mario Odyssey came out.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.040
That wasn't why I didn't-

38:50.040 --> 38:52.360
You were too busy putting that cheese in your seat.

38:52.360 --> 38:53.360
Yeah, I was fucking-

38:53.360 --> 38:55.560
What was the reason when you share it?

38:55.560 --> 39:04.440
I was like, yeah, that was scared or anxious, like I drove up to park, and yeah.

39:04.440 --> 39:05.440
You went all the way there?

39:05.440 --> 39:07.920
Yeah, no, three times I went all the way there.

39:07.920 --> 39:08.920
Yeah.

39:08.920 --> 39:10.040
This is, I mean, do you mind it?

39:10.040 --> 39:11.040
Can we talk about it?

39:11.040 --> 39:12.040
Yeah.

39:12.040 --> 39:19.000
So tell it, talk about what goes through your mind that makes the difference between parking

39:19.000 --> 39:24.520
the car and going into a party and continuing on, like what are the- I'm trying to figure

39:24.520 --> 39:27.560
out a better way to rephrase this so that you can answer easy questions.

39:27.560 --> 39:28.560
Yeah.

39:28.560 --> 39:32.200
I don't know, it's hard because it's not like, I don't know, I've had anxiety where

39:32.200 --> 39:37.280
it is like a conversation, you know, where it's like if you go in they're gonna be mean

39:37.280 --> 39:42.160
or you know whatever, and it wasn't like that, lately it's just been more just like a pressure

39:42.160 --> 39:43.160
upwelling.

39:43.160 --> 39:49.480
It's like, I'm gonna do this and then you just get there and it's like, I don't know,

39:49.480 --> 39:50.480
you know-

39:50.480 --> 39:57.760
Are you more worried about, if you, let's, I'm trying to figure out how to phrase this

39:57.760 --> 40:06.440
so that, because based on my experience, if you had a button in your hand that was, that

40:06.440 --> 40:14.720
the amount of pressure on the button created more or less attention on you, more or less

40:14.720 --> 40:21.120
people demanding answers from you about how you're doing and how you've been and all this

40:21.120 --> 40:31.760
stuff, it would you, like, how hard, I guess you're not, you're not afraid of obscurity,

40:31.760 --> 40:33.560
that's not the, you're afraid of attention, right?

40:33.560 --> 40:37.720
I don't know, I mean, when you're saying the button, it's like, I think it's both, like

40:37.720 --> 40:42.640
I'm thinking, I'm thinking, well, yeah, it's like I'm worried about, I don't know, like

40:42.640 --> 40:46.880
when I was trying to park, I saw all these people outside and I was like, I'm gonna have

40:46.880 --> 40:52.440
to get past these people to get to the party and like that in its own was like a thing,

40:52.440 --> 40:56.320
but it's not like, I didn't not want to talk to those people and I wanted to go to the

40:56.320 --> 41:00.080
party because I did want to talk to people, so it's not like I didn't want to be noticed

41:00.080 --> 41:05.240
and I wanted to be noted, or it's like it's both, but it's not either or neither, but

41:05.240 --> 41:10.920
yeah, it's kind of lack of control over a social situation where it's like, if you're

41:10.920 --> 41:15.360
obscure, like I remember being 25 and like the channel 101 days, it's like we all went

41:15.360 --> 41:19.200
to each other's parties because it was sort of an orgy of the more attention, the better

41:19.200 --> 41:22.960
and actually we're all on the same level and we can all just like pay attention to each

41:22.960 --> 41:30.920
other and nobody's really like suffering and then, but like it, for me, it's a control

41:30.920 --> 41:36.880
issue where I'm like, you know, actually I have nothing to gain anymore and no camaraderie

41:36.880 --> 41:42.560
to achieve, I only have maybe people that I'd like to talk to and then a whole shit ton

41:42.560 --> 41:48.720
of people that I can either disappoint or ignore, right, I like that sounds like I'm

41:48.720 --> 41:53.760
casting it in terms of like you think you're a rock star, I'm talking about because I don't

41:53.760 --> 41:57.120
feel like the camaraderie you say, like I don't feel like I'm gonna go to this party

41:57.120 --> 42:01.360
and I will feel closer to these people as a result, like that might be true, but that's

42:01.360 --> 42:03.080
not what I feel going into it.

42:03.080 --> 42:09.960
It's just like this could be fun and then that quickly gets like consumed by everything

42:09.960 --> 42:10.960
else.

42:10.960 --> 42:14.160
When the sense of responsibility comes in, when you're like obligation, when you look

42:14.160 --> 42:19.240
at like a little bit of a minefield of like eight groups of people and you're like, you

42:19.240 --> 42:24.080
know what, I'm never gonna like, and then you find yourself in a conversation with

42:24.080 --> 42:29.760
somebody and you're like, shit, I don't know when to leave or if I should want to leave.

42:29.760 --> 42:34.360
I could push a button in my head that made me want to talk to you about avionics for

42:34.360 --> 42:40.180
the next hour and a half, I really could, but at a certain point, my wife might come

42:40.180 --> 42:44.680
up and be like really upset that I've been talking about avionics for 90 minutes or

42:44.680 --> 42:52.000
I might find out that everybody left the party or I might, you know, I don't know,

42:52.000 --> 42:55.320
there's a bunch of people I didn't see, you know, friends of mine and stuff, I'm like,

42:55.320 --> 43:04.600
I don't know when, every conversation is a weird fencing match except instead of people

43:04.600 --> 43:10.120
trying to stab each other, it's like people trying to hug each other and so you can spend

43:10.120 --> 43:17.600
an indeterminate amount of time and every single conversation can only really end gracefully

43:17.600 --> 43:24.520
or ungracefully by somebody saying, well, I've decided I'm done talking to you so I'm

43:24.520 --> 43:30.240
gonna go talk to someone else, which doesn't feel very genuine because it's not practical

43:30.240 --> 43:35.960
because it would be better to say, well, I've enjoyed talking to you but I have to save

43:35.960 --> 43:42.520
a kitten from a tree, but to say I've enjoyed talking to you but I'm bored now or I want

43:42.520 --> 43:45.120
to see if there's someone better to talk to.

43:45.120 --> 43:47.120
I sort of did that last night.

43:47.120 --> 43:50.800
I mean, that's what we're doing all the time at each other parties and I don't and there's

43:50.800 --> 43:56.400
people who know how to handle that gracefully and there and I feel more kinship with Spencer

43:56.400 --> 44:00.200
and I'm like, I use the good old fashioned, hey, I bear back, I have to go pee.

44:00.200 --> 44:04.800
Yeah, because you're the guy that is able to leave, you're not the guy that's struggling

44:04.800 --> 44:07.880
to not lose at a party, you're always winning.

44:07.880 --> 44:17.720
Well, I mean, I have my own version of anxiety there but just because Jeff said, he says,

44:17.720 --> 44:19.000
I gotta go pee.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.720
So why can't you and I say I gotta go pee?

44:21.720 --> 44:22.720
Do you lie?

44:22.720 --> 44:23.720
You don't have to pee that much.

44:23.720 --> 44:27.680
But people leave us in conversations, right?

44:27.680 --> 44:34.440
I'm comfortable saying, hey, I'll be right back or hey, I'm gonna go over and say hi

44:34.440 --> 44:35.440
to my friend over there.

44:35.440 --> 44:36.440
I just saw it.

44:36.440 --> 44:37.960
I'll write, you're comfortable.

44:37.960 --> 44:42.040
But that's more key, but that's why I wanted to address that because it's not true what

44:42.040 --> 44:43.040
you initially said.

44:43.040 --> 44:44.040
No, no.

44:44.040 --> 44:45.040
Don't just tell everybody you're gonna go pee.

44:45.040 --> 44:46.040
I will say this.

44:46.040 --> 44:49.720
You are more comfortable saying the truth, which is, see you later.

44:49.720 --> 44:54.960
If I'm being cornered by a jerk, you're at the drawing room and some guy just won't get

44:54.960 --> 45:00.160
off your ass, I am very comfortable lying and say, oh, God, I gotta go take a shit.

45:00.160 --> 45:03.040
I'll be back in four years.

45:03.040 --> 45:07.480
I'll say whatever it takes to get away from somebody who's punishing me.

45:07.480 --> 45:14.680
If they're engaged in a social crime on their own, if they're so drunk or crazy or selfish.

45:14.680 --> 45:18.960
Depending on how little I'm afraid of getting punched or a drink thrown at me, I'll just

45:18.960 --> 45:24.240
say, hey, I'm gonna go hang out with other people and just bone the fuck out.

45:24.240 --> 45:31.240
But the thing that you said, Spencer, about pulling up and seeing a crowd, I have my own

45:31.240 --> 45:35.920
thing about, it's not like, oh my God, I gotta walk through a crowd and everyone's gonna stop

45:35.920 --> 45:36.920
me.

45:36.920 --> 45:37.920
It's not like that.

45:37.920 --> 45:40.640
It's not like I'm so rad that that's gonna be a bummer.

45:40.640 --> 45:44.200
But there's times when you just don't want to walk through a crowd and you might just

45:44.200 --> 45:47.400
want to be able to get from point A to point B without being stopped and you can't be in

45:47.400 --> 45:49.040
control of that.

45:49.040 --> 45:54.040
When I do comedy shows, I disappear after the show.

45:54.040 --> 45:58.320
When we do it on the Harmon Tour and stuff like that, when the show's over, I usually

45:58.320 --> 46:00.720
find a place to be alone.

46:00.720 --> 46:09.600
I need that few minutes just to go hide, see if church texted, just be complete, I don't

46:09.600 --> 46:15.520
want to be around the sound of maybe being asked to talk or do a thing.

46:15.520 --> 46:24.480
But I am a jerk, so I'm not uncomfortable wearing the black hat if I really have to get

46:24.480 --> 46:25.680
out of a situation.

46:25.680 --> 46:32.160
I don't think, it won't pay in this analysis for us to, you know, like there's no good

46:32.160 --> 46:33.160
or bad.

46:33.160 --> 46:39.440
It's just, but it's worth examining because I observe about myself, I'm like, well, if

46:39.440 --> 46:44.880
you do a live show and then you're Santa Claus and there's a line of people, it's like there

46:44.880 --> 46:48.400
are moments when I feel like this is how I'm comfortable.

46:48.400 --> 46:55.680
And the reason is because it's orderly and it requires an introduction and at a party,

46:55.680 --> 47:01.880
I think this is like people, it's like, like people go like, hey, how are you?

47:01.880 --> 47:05.960
Like I don't know, it's just so freeform, it's like orgiastic and I like, I start to freak

47:05.960 --> 47:13.160
the fuck out and I spend every conversation that I have at a party, like I hold my drink

47:13.160 --> 47:18.640
like, and if it's in a plastic cup as last night, it's like, it's like the cup splits

47:18.640 --> 47:23.400
open very early on because I'm squeezing it and I'm, it doesn't matter who I'm talking

47:23.400 --> 47:27.600
to, it's just like, because I'm always thinking like, what are you supposed to do?

47:27.600 --> 47:28.600
When is this supposed to end?

47:28.600 --> 47:29.880
Is this going on too long?

47:29.880 --> 47:30.880
What am I supposed to say?

47:30.880 --> 47:32.680
Am I being a bad person or a good person?

47:32.680 --> 47:33.680
Where's Cody?

47:33.680 --> 47:35.640
Like, like, wait, what am I doing?

47:35.640 --> 47:36.640
What am I doing?

47:36.640 --> 47:37.640
Why am I doing this?

47:37.640 --> 47:43.600
I think, maybe I've mentioned this before on the show, but like, I think a long time

47:43.600 --> 47:47.560
ago and you were my friend when this happened, I just started wearing suits all the time

47:47.560 --> 47:54.200
and I think that's a social cue body armor thing that people tend to leave me a little

47:54.200 --> 47:55.200
bit more alone.

47:55.200 --> 47:56.200
Well, I think it makes-

47:56.200 --> 47:58.200
So I get to call the shots on that a little bit more.

47:58.200 --> 48:04.240
Well, and also, I think that when you get up in the morning, because when you commit

48:04.240 --> 48:11.800
to being a suit guy, even though it seems second nature to you, when you get up in the

48:11.800 --> 48:18.040
morning, like, there's social laws against leaving your house without a minimum amount

48:18.040 --> 48:24.840
of clothing on and Spencer and I are wearing the minimum amount of clothing.

48:24.840 --> 48:29.960
Like we're wearing, which means that we actually get up out of bed and we go over to a pile

48:29.960 --> 48:30.960
of clothes.

48:30.960 --> 48:32.400
So am I thanks to Bomfell who never gave me my goddamn clothes?

48:32.400 --> 48:36.160
Let's not get too distracted, but when I think that that's the-

48:36.160 --> 48:44.080
I'm pitching, I guess, the advantage socially of having a style is because you actually

48:44.080 --> 48:50.320
like on Halloween, like you wake up every morning and you put an amount of attention,

48:50.320 --> 48:55.080
you put on a suit of armor and it doesn't have to be about, oh, armor protecting the

48:55.080 --> 48:59.680
real you from the outside world, like that's disingenuous.

48:59.680 --> 49:03.600
It's more about like, that's also actually the important thing is that you're saying,

49:03.600 --> 49:08.680
you're acknowledging every morning that the reason you're leaving your house is to interact

49:08.680 --> 49:14.200
with other people and not to put words in your mouth, but Spencer and I don't do that.

49:14.200 --> 49:19.240
We get up out of bed and we go, the reason I'm leaving my house is because I have to.

49:19.240 --> 49:23.720
I have an appointment and so I'm going to put this potato sack on with holes in it for

49:23.720 --> 49:26.800
my arms because otherwise I'll get arrested.

49:26.800 --> 49:30.200
And it casts a kind of pawl over the whole thing.

49:30.200 --> 49:33.760
Meanwhile, you're going like, it's in the way that you use it.

49:33.760 --> 49:37.400
And then every interaction you have, there's a little bit of license for you to-

49:37.400 --> 49:38.400
To be alone.

49:38.400 --> 49:40.680
To perform.

49:40.680 --> 49:48.040
Or with a stern look or like-

49:48.040 --> 49:49.560
Well, sure, there's that too.

49:49.560 --> 49:53.200
I can be completely alone in public in a suit.

49:53.200 --> 49:57.920
I can also, like I said before, my impression of myself is everybody can have everyone's

49:57.920 --> 49:59.960
attention, please leave me alone.

49:59.960 --> 50:03.880
And that's like, I get up, everybody look at me, now fucking shut up.

50:03.880 --> 50:08.000
And I want to, like, I bring earplugs wherever I go because I like to read in public, which

50:08.000 --> 50:11.400
is self-destructive and stupid because I'm always mad that people are talking.

50:11.400 --> 50:15.080
It's like, why did you just get an armchair and read it home?

50:15.080 --> 50:19.320
Yeah, I guess I've kind of said also though that when I go over to my pile of 800 Rick

50:19.320 --> 50:23.400
and Morty t-shirts and my three pants that do or don't fit depending on how many Twinkies

50:23.400 --> 50:28.800
I've had that year, like I always have the swirling thoughts in my head about whether

50:28.800 --> 50:33.840
or not I care whether or not people like the way I look and all this stuff.

50:33.840 --> 50:43.280
And you cut through that before you enter the world because you are formalizing you're

50:43.280 --> 50:44.680
getting dressed.

50:44.680 --> 50:48.840
You're going, I'm going out into the world and when I'm going out into the world, I'm

50:48.840 --> 50:52.560
an ambassador of my self-ness to the otherness.

50:52.560 --> 50:57.000
And so that means that if someone comes up to me and says, hey man, you want to buy a

50:57.000 --> 51:01.840
potato for a three dollars, I don't know what that character is.

51:01.840 --> 51:03.080
I don't know what race he is.

51:03.080 --> 51:06.240
I'm sorry for all the emails I'm going to get.

51:06.240 --> 51:09.240
That must be a good potato, a three dollar potato.

51:09.240 --> 51:11.560
Also, we added an article to dollars.

51:11.560 --> 51:16.600
But you can not only, because it's not, it is, it's part armor, part performance, all

51:16.600 --> 51:22.040
the stuff that's like a, when we talk, when we do me undies ads and we talk about the

51:22.040 --> 51:27.320
first decision you make when you get out of bed is are you going to put on cotton underwear

51:27.320 --> 51:31.720
that are like, oh, I got to protect my nuts from my own pants.

51:31.720 --> 51:36.320
Or are you going to sheath them in glorious micro mandal?

51:36.320 --> 51:41.280
Which actually says to you, the important person to say it to, I love my nuts being

51:41.280 --> 51:46.040
cradled in, I didn't mean for that synergy to happen.

51:46.040 --> 51:47.040
Right.

51:47.040 --> 51:50.160
There's these, we've talked about it before, I'm sure, that there's two great books by

51:50.160 --> 51:54.520
Quentin Crisp, one's called Doing It With Style and one's called How to Have a Lifestyle.

51:54.520 --> 52:00.400
And it's about what is style and personal style doesn't mean fashion, it doesn't mean

52:00.400 --> 52:06.000
money, it doesn't mean sex, it doesn't mean power, it's self-knowledge.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.640
How you're carrying yourself to other people, to have a camera on yourself.

52:09.640 --> 52:15.080
Like I'm sure I'm repeating myself, but as Quentin Crisp said, someone asked him what

52:15.080 --> 52:20.840
is style and he said, style is being yourself only on purpose.

52:20.840 --> 52:26.320
And so that takes a level, like you can be homeless with style, you can be, it doesn't

52:26.320 --> 52:30.880
have to be fancy pants, like it's simply who you are.

52:30.880 --> 52:37.160
Like Spencer, you have style, you have so much style that nine people can show up at

52:37.160 --> 52:41.560
a Halloween party dressed as you and everyone goes, oh fuck, we're all Spencers today.

52:41.560 --> 52:44.560
It's just aesthetically terrible style.

52:44.560 --> 52:52.220
No, but like you, like when you on Harmon Quest pop out of the wilderness wearing your

52:52.220 --> 52:59.000
lumberjack shirt and your shorts, like you, you're impersonatable.

52:59.000 --> 53:07.000
Because I think it's absolutely okay and for me, beneficial to have a uniform.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.520
Like I have a lot of clothes in my place and I don't wear any of them.

53:10.520 --> 53:16.880
I wear my suits, I wear my black shoes, I wear my dress shirts and then I've got a million

53:16.880 --> 53:18.760
t-shirts that I wear at home.

53:18.760 --> 53:23.080
And then if I, the only time I'm ever not in a suit, I'm wearing one other outfit.

53:23.080 --> 53:27.240
And I just realized like one day is like, I'm sick of picking fucking clothes out in

53:27.240 --> 53:28.240
the morning.

53:28.240 --> 53:33.800
Like for me, I just want to make sure that the dry cleaner, like the stuff that I know

53:33.800 --> 53:37.320
I'm going to want that week is ready to go.

53:37.320 --> 53:43.840
And my closet is like Einstein's basically, it's just a bunch of blue and gray suits and

53:43.840 --> 53:45.960
a lot of white shirts.

53:45.960 --> 53:49.840
And I find that really relaxing.

53:49.840 --> 53:55.640
That's something I don't want to spend time really thinking about as much as I like clothes.

53:55.640 --> 53:57.840
I don't want to think about variety.

53:57.840 --> 54:01.480
I just like a nice dark suit with a white shirt and black shoes.

54:01.480 --> 54:02.480
Right.

54:02.480 --> 54:06.800
But somebody who's like, it's the t-shirt culture, which we all live in, like t-shirts

54:06.800 --> 54:11.960
once upon a time where like underwear and now they've become a thing you can put on.

54:11.960 --> 54:15.960
I feel incredibly nude going to the market in a t-shirt like when it's 900,000 degrees

54:15.960 --> 54:17.840
out like it's been for the last couple of weeks.

54:17.840 --> 54:22.400
I feel like I'm basically walking to the supermarket like in a bathing suit.

54:22.400 --> 54:28.760
I think the key is like, as I said, like my therapist has said, like that the new era

54:28.760 --> 54:35.640
that we're entering, hopefully that it's different, that the large theme is unconscious

54:35.640 --> 54:37.280
versus conscious.

54:37.280 --> 54:45.400
And so it's like, it's possible to be unconscious and get up in the morning and go like, I'm

54:45.400 --> 54:54.720
going to pull this idiocracy shirt from this dispenser and throw it on myself.

54:54.720 --> 54:55.720
And that's fine.

54:55.720 --> 55:00.640
It's like no one's, we're used to the bad guys being people that tell you what you should

55:00.640 --> 55:02.080
wear.

55:02.080 --> 55:07.840
But somewhere in there, it's like, all the, there's so many things that we don't think

55:07.840 --> 55:10.440
about that then we're like worried about.

55:10.440 --> 55:17.200
And like for me and Spencer, and I suppose probably 99% of our listenership, it's like

55:17.200 --> 55:23.920
conversations with people, small talk, like grace, tact, square dancing of conversation

55:23.920 --> 55:26.840
where you could just go, Hey, it's nice talking to you.

55:26.840 --> 55:32.440
I'm like, wouldn't you love knowing that like, Hey, I'd love to, I'd love talking to you.

55:32.440 --> 55:34.600
And now I'm going to love talking over there.

55:34.600 --> 55:35.600
I'm going to walk away.

55:35.600 --> 55:39.880
It's like everyone would respond to that and they'd be totally fine with that.

55:39.880 --> 55:42.880
But I don't, I don't have those things.

55:42.880 --> 55:48.280
I don't, I don't, I've, I've, I've been living in a society so luxurious that I've been able

55:48.280 --> 55:54.080
to slither this far while the entire time maintaining that I don't know how to talk

55:54.080 --> 56:00.640
to people, don't know how to dress, don't know how to think about race, gender, all

56:00.640 --> 56:06.160
of these things being myself, but on purpose, I, I've been able to be myself on accident.

56:06.160 --> 56:10.360
That's a pretty luxurious thing, but it also had, then it results in all these like, Oh

56:10.360 --> 56:13.080
shit, I have mold between my big toe and my little toe.

56:13.080 --> 56:18.600
Well, yeah, no shit, like you, you, you've not thought about a single thing that you've

56:18.600 --> 56:19.600
ever done.

56:19.600 --> 56:21.600
Mold between your big toe and little toe means all the way across.

56:21.600 --> 56:24.120
It means, means no, none of your toes exist.

56:24.120 --> 56:26.200
I was, I got derailed by my own fucking thing.

56:26.200 --> 56:30.720
I mean, I, like, like church has style, like crazy, and it's like, I love it because like

56:30.720 --> 56:35.760
we can go out clothes shopping and like, we went the other day to a, to a store that she

56:35.760 --> 56:42.280
likes downtown and like, I like going through the racks and looking for stuff for her.

56:42.280 --> 56:44.920
And sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm wrong, but like, and she's like, Oh, I love

56:44.920 --> 56:49.640
that you, she's like, I like when you go out and like, like, like help, like, like, like

56:49.640 --> 56:54.720
look for stuff, but also like, like we, we can have a lot of fun in the clothes store

56:54.720 --> 57:02.240
because it's not that like clothing is your identity, but the execution of our style has

57:02.240 --> 57:04.160
something to do with fashion.

57:04.160 --> 57:11.440
Yours doesn't like the execution of your style and Spencer's style is not fashion.

57:11.440 --> 57:15.280
It's other things, you know, it's more about brains and, you know, and the writing and

57:15.280 --> 57:16.640
the products and things like that.

57:16.640 --> 57:21.240
Yeah, yeah, but yeah, and then we, and then that's why we, that's why we murder people.

57:21.240 --> 57:24.320
You know who else has style, Callie Cazoo.

57:24.320 --> 57:25.880
Do you guys know her?

57:25.880 --> 57:26.880
I do.

57:26.880 --> 57:28.640
She's doing a Kickstarter.

57:28.640 --> 57:29.640
Check it out.

57:29.640 --> 57:30.640
I like her music.

57:30.640 --> 57:32.640
She wants to buy more Aqua, Aqua Seafoam boots.

57:32.640 --> 57:34.360
If you go to her Kickstarter.

57:34.360 --> 57:38.760
Yeah, you can go to support Callie Cazoo's third album, Extravaganza.

57:38.760 --> 57:43.400
I already donated, you should because she'll give you free shit.

57:43.400 --> 57:47.160
Like I made a small donation, she's gonna give me a bunch of little drawings and like

57:47.160 --> 57:48.160
groovy stuff.

57:48.160 --> 57:49.160
Oh yeah.

57:49.160 --> 57:50.160
Yeah.

57:50.160 --> 57:53.920
It's like, like you don't get nothing for paying something, you get something for paying

57:53.920 --> 57:54.920
something.

57:54.920 --> 57:55.920
It's gonna be great.

57:55.920 --> 57:56.920
Yeah.

57:56.920 --> 58:04.120
A guy touched my girlfriend's face in a bar while I watched and did nothing.

58:04.120 --> 58:06.880
Like in a romantic sense or like he accidentally brushed her?

58:06.880 --> 58:09.120
Well, you tell me.

58:09.120 --> 58:17.160
Yeah, in this new world of like, okay, let's be respectful and nice and all this shit.

58:17.160 --> 58:23.280
It's like, I feel like I was really high at the Halloween party and I really got a good

58:23.280 --> 58:24.280
handle on this.

58:24.280 --> 58:27.640
I was talking to a bunch of other beta males about how like the accountability that we

58:27.640 --> 58:34.040
have where it's like, we're emerging into this place now where it's like, let's take

58:34.040 --> 58:35.720
down the alphas.

58:35.720 --> 58:37.120
They're so disrespectful.

58:37.120 --> 58:38.120
They're terrible.

58:38.120 --> 58:39.440
They're all these terrible things.

58:39.440 --> 58:46.440
And then it's like, wait a minute, though, to the extent that it's every man for himself,

58:46.440 --> 58:54.960
if you're a beta and you start to panic where you're like, oh, I think we invented everything

58:54.960 --> 58:57.640
that like holds us together.

58:57.640 --> 59:04.760
I'm self identifying with like a sub race of like men that are like, I don't want to

59:04.760 --> 59:10.120
beat another man's skull in if he looks at my girl from the wrong way.

59:10.120 --> 59:15.920
I want to have the confidence to prance about the world knowing that I own it because I'm

59:15.920 --> 59:18.080
talented because guess what?

59:18.080 --> 59:25.960
Your muscles will get you this far, not this far, that that is a that's called modern society.

59:25.960 --> 59:31.720
And I just got this taste of it as in this bar with Cody, we had biked from my house

59:31.720 --> 59:35.080
to a bar, and we're minding our own business.

59:35.080 --> 59:43.600
I'm 44 goddamn years old, like girlfriend is 30 fucking two years old.

59:43.600 --> 59:45.840
We're adults.

59:45.840 --> 59:51.640
We're just taking our bicycles, which by the way, every time we stopped at a stop light,

59:51.640 --> 59:55.600
whatever, there was like a guy who came up to Cody and, you know, it was like, like,

59:55.600 --> 59:58.520
hey, guys, some kind of biking club.

59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.600
It's like, like, I'm seeing it through all kinds of new eyes.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:04.440
I was like, yeah, just anything, anything that like licensed you to talk to a girl like

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.440
you never know.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.040
Like I was just such a ridiculous, really, what are you guys are in a biking club?

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.040
Whatever.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.040
I'm not.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.040
I don't care.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.800
Like I'm not I'm not like fucking stop talking to my girlfriend, but it's like I'm just looking

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.160
at it through new eyes seeing it where I'm like I'm like seeing it now.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.720
It's it's it's it's it's luminol.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.720
Right.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:24.680
It's our like fecal fecal detector, like a black light and I'm seeing like common shit

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.680
everywhere.

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:32.040
Then you go go to this, then we go to this bar and like I like like let's take photos

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:40.000
of each other sitting at the bar holding cocktails with our biker helmet on like fun.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.800
So she takes a picture of me and she's the lighting is such that she should take my stool.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.080
It takes picture.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.840
I stand back taking a couple pictures of Cody.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.160
She's got her helmet on.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.320
She's holding a cocktail adjusting.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.320
I want it to be good.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.600
I want it to be good for Instagram.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:04.400
This guy like goes like excuse me like it's just like like commands that's like commands

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.840
my space and goes like excuse me.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.840
I cannot cannot.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:08.840
I'm sorry.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.840
It's you.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.240
Can I can I help you with this photo?

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.440
Oh boy.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:17.960
And I so let's go back to this after the whole story after the whole interaction plays out

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.720
and and you tell me what I should do when and where but all right I got it all loaded

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.920
up here's here's here's here's what I don't do at that moment.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.840
I don't go no fuck off.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:38.920
That's what you should and the reason I don't do it at that moment is because I don't assume

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:46.920
that what's about to happen is going to happen right I think that I'm in Hollywood and he's

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:53.360
a DP like that like if that it would be my male ego that would make me go fuck you don't

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:57.960
shut up and that actually this is how you make new friends.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.640
This is how you have a good time.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.500
This is why you came to a bar.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:08.040
This is why this is overall my experience like someone from your community says hey

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.040
you live in Los Angeles.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.680
I know just trying to take a picture here.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.120
I I work for fucking Bruckheimer.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.840
I don't like I don't make it look like a goddamn Transformers movie.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:22.720
If you move this candle he said can I help sorry can I help like you know like like like

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:27.920
came in with this thing and my reflexive response because I insist because I'm a good person

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:35.000
it was was was yeah yeah yeah yeah and he instead of taking my camera now he moves forward

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.600
because he's on the move and he's moving past me and he's moving over to Coney and

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:47.720
he and and so now it's too late it's like like his his suggestion of how to make the

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:58.680
picture better is he wants to take the biker helmet that's on her head and turn it backwards

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:03.040
which by the way doesn't make it look any different.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.960
That's the kind of suggestion you'd hear from the kind of person who would suggest at a

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:14.160
bar to help you take a photo yeah that's strange well except that there might I would I would

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:20.440
argue with you either for the sake of my pride or for the sake of humanity's defense I would

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:28.760
say that honestly Spencer it like like it sometimes if not most of the time a stranger

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:34.240
who says can I suggest something can I offer something can I help you can I can improve

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.520
your life actually like it's it's kind of like if you don't if you resist the urge to

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:45.160
plant it of the apes them that it it actually turns out to be fine right I guess I'm reading

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:50.960
too much into the tone of voice you use well that's true you started the story telling

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:57.000
you I'm just the honestly the tone of voice if that's how that's not the kind of help

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.640
I want yeah let's stop there and reset because that's actually making it very clear that

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:07.160
it's important that I actually try to do a realistic impression of the guy okay and

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:13.480
I'm gonna try it like I it agonizes me to try it because I'm reliving trauma sorry you

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:20.680
got this but like I like I guess my best impression would be like hey can I make a suggestion

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:27.840
here or is that like hey even hand hey can I help you with this photo or no that sounds

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:32.800
rapey too I just like I didn't it sounded like sounded normal hey can I touch your girlfriend's

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:40.040
face the guy didn't and so and then so then yeah he turns the hat backwards and I'm like

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:48.520
are you fucking kidding me and I don't know I'm holding a camera while three feet from

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:54.720
me this guy like a first of all now the first fuck you is on a human level because it's

01:04:54.720 --> 01:05:01.840
just oh can I just do a different thing than you were doing I fucking I and and and women

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.000
who are listening are gonna be like do you think this is like this is the whole problem

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.520
I'm like yes yes it is the whole problem because yes the same thing that made him want to do

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:13.440
it whatever level he thought he wanted to do it on I all I just want to are now I want

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:18.440
to beat his brains and I want to fucking pound him because I'm like you'd never ever ever

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:23.560
wanted to help do anything and this is before sexuality gets into it he could be gay for

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:28.440
all I know I still want to beat his brains in because he's a fucking weird like fucking

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:33.120
like he's just a person that wants to fuck with shit and you and and I didn't enter that

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:36.720
agreement with him I took him in his word that he wanted to do that and now he's just

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:42.520
doing bullshit to just change shit and piss on it this is before now the next thing that

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:48.320
happens is because he put it fucking he puts her hat on backwards now well guess what her

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:56.240
hair is different now now he has to stroke her face and move her hair out of the way

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:01.640
as I'm holding a camera three feet from my girlfriend in broad daylight in a bar while

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:08.680
a man that didn't beat me up that never said I'm a bigger man than you I choose to challenge

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:16.920
you well just is making me watch him touch stroke my girlfriend's face while he dictates

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:24.060
the terms of my photograph what am I supposed to do how is a modern man supposed to deal

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:32.360
with this shit like like because the beta male like who I am a member of the the way

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:39.480
we dealt with it before was well I own everything and and and ask your friends and like this

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:44.600
behavior like I go ahead and follow your urges but if it pisses me off you're not gonna get

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:49.680
hired a lot I you're not gonna get a loan at that bank I own like I make Rick and Morty

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:54.320
and all this stuff but it's like in these tiny micro moments and also assuming if we're

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:59.400
not gonna go with hierarchy as a measurement of how you should treat women if in other

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:08.640
words beta males are controlling like how alphas treat women because we own alphas do

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:16.000
we have to like have accountability and go okay now that the zoo is loose like oh so

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.640
I don't own alphas and I don't own women do I have to get in a fight with this guy do

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:30.280
I have to like learn how do I just go to bars less do I feel like so what happened nothing

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:34.640
just trauma I mean he fucking he was done as soon as he stroked my girlfriend's face

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:40.120
with his smelly fingers which I'm sure smelled better than mine I did like like he got what

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:44.640
he wanted you know he was gone he didn't it wasn't like a take a movie where he's gonna

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:50.840
keep doing it before you stop him he did what he wanted and he walked away he did that to

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:56.320
maybe eight people and maybe one of the women like like what I don't know what his game is

01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:01.480
he did it and he walked away and that man's name is Mayor Richard Reardon I was gonna

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:07.440
say Steve's on but yeah that's fucked up you do you got the camera you just you just take

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:11.720
I should have taken a fucking thousand pictures of him yeah like this guy had a lot of opinions

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.960
about my girlfriend point the camera right where's dick is like you get done they go take

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:22.320
it out and I know and you have the confidence to do that and I froze I was like what what

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:27.440
what how long do I have to wait for this guy to go away what what how how do I get back

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:34.080
to my comfort zone which is not me hiding from him but is me owning everything that's

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:39.120
the important thing like how do I get back to my comfort zone where I'm king shit not

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:43.120
where I'm hiding in a bush the Cody was Cody uncomfortable and freaked out by this like how

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:48.520
did she hated it she hated it and you can see in the photo there's a photo of her with

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:56.160
a backwards bike helmet I went her face is crimson yuck and she's forcing a smile and

01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:02.720
she looks great because women deal with that all the time and they just and and the photos

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:09.400
taken by a fucking cock who just watched what is that the photo where her hair looks perfect

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:15.160
and her hat is on backwards yeah that's amazing my favorite photo of looks ridiculous and

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:21.640
she looks fucking like purple and it's and and and every time I look at my own bike helmet

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:28.040
I my dick shrivels up into my abdomen and and and I like I don't I just like these are

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:32.280
new questions that are going to emerge if we're going to be good men if we're going to also

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:37.200
say because we can't just say hey don't jerk off into a pot of plant blocker door with

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:45.400
like that that you know what the society starts with guys that can't throw a spear as hard

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:50.880
saying yeah but I can type a funnier joke than you and it and and and then at that translates

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:55.200
into like hierarchy so it's like I think there might be a little bit of like I need to learn

01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:02.400
how to punch a dude in the fucking face verbally or as gallant as you where it's like like

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:07.520
like like oh you would I know that you you you you spent 20 years before you finally

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.080
got head butted in there your nose broke but like that was 20 years of you having recourse

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:19.640
to masculinity I like I like like I I have to learn so like to recognize that and then

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:25.920
like react like my adrenaline just froze me I'm like this dude is just like oh oh oh oh

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:30.080
he's just touching my girlfriend's face and then the time for it faster than it takes

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:36.520
me to even think that he's done it took this long it took that long mm-hmm what am I supposed

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:43.520
to do cut that off halfway I just say hey get back here hey mister I what am I supposed

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:47.960
to do yeah timing is always going to be hard because it's never going to be the perfect

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:51.880
timing you're never going to make it in time you're never going to hit it right in the middle

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:56.920
it's always going to be too late I mean obviously hindsight's 2020 right so it's not like we

01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:01.400
did anything wrong I spent the last 23 years calling everybody I thought it was a cunt

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.480
a cunt and this one cunt punched me in the fucking nose and broke my nose but what about

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:08.840
timing like what we have infinite timing now what I would have said I would have said hey

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:17.280
man you don't touch a woman without her consent oh damn I mean you gave him permission to help

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:21.360
with a picture right you certainly didn't give her permission anyone permission to touch

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.960
a woman right right he didn't give him so but in real so you would you would say that

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:30.600
if I were a super if I were a superhero that's what I would have done if I were in your if

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:36.400
you're a superhuman not a superhero if you're a superhuman if you had so I was a natural

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:41.480
it no if you could move faster than human reflex no would say it as his fingers touched

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:48.000
her face right or afterwards okay well so that really should we do that yeah he does

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.800
that and now he's gone and go hey man yeah hey yeah yeah that's not it's that's the thing

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:58.560
the timing's not gonna like it and then everyone ever goes like what's going on sounds like

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:05.000
someone wants everything that's going normally to stop hey mister hey you don't treat a lady

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.040
like that you hear and then Cody if she's worth her salt is gonna go it's okay it's fine

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:17.600
please don't protract this trauma please don't do right it's when someone abuses the system

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:23.920
and subverts the rule of law to make everyone uncomfortable there's not really a way to just

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:29.480
I'm sorry no to make one person uncomfortable versus the 40 people I make uncomfortable

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:35.640
by calling him out right but the world is uncomfortable by this stuff it's it's not it's

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:40.160
not supposed to be comfortable the balance was upset when he touched someone you know

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:44.920
that was that was what through and then everyone else has to make the decision to either be

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:49.080
cool or not be cool but that's because of him it's not like I mean obviously it is a

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:53.040
decision you're making but it's not the decision that you were forced to make it was a decision

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:59.880
that he forced on you by breaking the balance and you know disrespecting personal boundaries

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:04.440
yeah and to me the tragedy is so three weeks from now I'm gonna be taking a picture of

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:10.520
my girlfriend and like Michelle Gondry is gonna come up or the next to Michelle Gondry

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:14.240
is gonna go actually they're gonna notice that I'm like backlighting her when it could

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:19.040
be like hey can I help you with this photo and I'm gonna go fuck you fuck you you fucking

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:25.680
rapist like why don't you what or I know I'm exaggerating like I like like for real like

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:31.480
it was he comes out hey can I help and I go how how because that would be an appropriate

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:37.160
response given how that guy behave or how are you gonna help yeah like I have to scrutinize

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:42.320
every single interaction I have I can't just in spite of how much energy it takes for me

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.320
to treat people normally you know when I go out in public and it's like it's already hard

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:53.720
for me to like to have people walk away from interaction with me not going that guy's an

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:59.160
asshole like so I have like reflexes that I've like programmed on top everybody does

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.880
that's it that's how everyone yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah whatever

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:07.320
you want whatever you want yeah and then it's like okay so then you're going whatever you

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.360
want this is like fucking predators that are like like relying on that reaction that's what

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.280
they're relying on yes so then you go okay no more yeah yeah yeah whatever you want from

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.600
now on my reflex is gonna be what's going on what's going on what's going on what's

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:24.000
going on great the world's gonna be fucking beautiful in five minutes we're living through

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.280
that right now we are I mean you keep hearing these new directors these new personalities

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:34.400
being accused it's not oh shit it's not comfortable what are you doing well I wanted to commit to

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.800
it being on my shirt but I poured vodka on my shirt and I I didn't want it to get on

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:47.320
my phone that's a different matter entirely speaking of different matters entirely Spencer

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:51.960
what do you think about giving us a big long recap of D&D because it's been a long time

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:58.360
since I've been around and played you want to you and do you want to do a little what's

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:11.000
play that that's Dan singing so good I guess that I don't know that's ho hozer nice do

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:19.840
you really name your band hoser if you're like who's it who's the Canadian guys Mackenzie

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:25.640
Brothers take off yeah exactly yeah take off a hozer all right sorry anyways I don't

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:31.920
know I'd like but it's not comfortable it's it's what you know remember and it doesn't

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:36.840
happen to me that much but I bet it happens to a lot of fucking people yeah all the time

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:44.560
it does I created Rick and Morty and that shit happened to me at sunset and sunset like

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:50.680
in in full view of every hipster wearing gauzy t-shirt like this shit like like if you're

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:57.240
if you're listening and you constantly feel worried that like your masculinity is being

01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:01.920
like impugned like our challenge like the important thing is like I think that's how

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:08.960
this all started so now like now let's let's reboot and like figure out a way through these

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:16.040
moments together where we don't take the course we took six thousand years ago where we went

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:20.920
you know what enough is enough from now on if you love a man and you're gonna have babies

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:24.320
with him you need to sign this contract and any guy that fucks you as a criminal and he

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:29.600
gets hung from the highest tree like because I'm talented and I bring more meat into this

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:38.280
cave like like we we as a tribe meaning we as the the male that doesn't want to I don't

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:45.240
know like like like we started this we I'm like I want to know what I do as an individual

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:50.760
I want to be Humphrey Bogart the next time some dude from some chode fucking like disrespects

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:59.200
my space my my my girlfriends like privacy and agency like in public I want to have like

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:06.440
a foolproof response that doesn't make me a dick yeah it's hard to do it like very early

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:11.800
on like dating church we were at some restaurant and some asshole like bumped our table and

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:20.160
knocked shit all over us and was not cool about it and he was you know just a dick and

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:28.160
I really made a scene and she was just like fucking don't do that like like don't like

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:34.160
I didn't let it go it wasn't making things better I escalated shit and she's just like

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:41.640
fucking don't ever do that again and like I wanted instant justice and you're not going

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.840
to get it from that fucking asshole that's the thing it's gonna be a woman's worst nightmare

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.880
not to mansplain what that is but it's gotta be like there's gotta be a highway cone where

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:55.000
they're like well yeah I'd be nice if if there was a but no you're yeah this is my worst

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.280
nightmare now I have to visit Goths like like I'm always the thing of saying something that

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:05.240
hurts the person's feelings as they walk away that's that's not very healthy and once

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:12.040
it got my nose broken so I mean the truth is in like a perfectly natural primate society

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:16.400
look I don't know there's eight billion other dudes if they all wanted to gang up on me and

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:21.320
beat me up they can have all my shit so then we have capitalism then we have politics then

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.520
we have government so like we all wake up every day in a world where they're like you're not

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:29.320
allowed to climb in my window and have what I have I didn't put in a spirit gum on this

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:33.920
beard and it's coming up because I'm laughing too much and now my fucking beard's popping

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:40.000
up and I'm like what kind of commander we're all laughing too much we're all laughing too

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:48.360
much anyways we were about to I think segue into maybe D&D but I do feel like might whereas

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:53.000
usually where we segue into D&D and then we heap on dispensary go like okay now quickly

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:00.520
do a recap as part of the D&D segment we I think it might help Spencer if we identify

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:08.880
a pre D&D period before we start playing D&D where we where we figure out what the fuck

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:13.000
happened yes no no I'm saying I because it's not on him because you guys played once I

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.800
think when I wasn't here and we haven't played rock as you weren't here Spencer like it seems

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.320
like it's been a couple months since I've played D&D I think you're at the last one

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:25.080
was I I don't fucking we turn in the missions we've all got licensed to not know what the

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:31.080
hell yeah let's let's before I do the the role of the music Spencer like do you have

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:36.760
the sheets and in the film plan yeah yeah hand those out because we have loads of time

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:42.960
right now and let's get this at least back up in the air while I get set stuff out let's

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:47.480
do a little bit of podcast business because we're like let's be transparent about this

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:52.360
we moved from the venue where we had a live audience into this place and then we're like

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:56.840
we had a discussion tonight we're like pulled up the numbers of like like who's listening

01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:01.240
when and who's you know like and it looks like well I mean there's a million ways to

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:07.560
look at a million different numbers but like there's an indication that this transition

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:15.480
is costing us like people's faith that there's that the upset is like we've cracked the whip

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:20.080
here whether it's people thinking that the podcast is over and not and they don't have

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:23.560
communication that the podcast is continuing or whether it's people that genuinely hate

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:28.560
this format and don't know it'll ever end like who knows there's a million variables

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:33.240
but we did talk a lot tonight about what we I think what we kind of came to the agreement

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:36.960
on is that we don't know what's going on we don't know when the space will be back when

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:41.320
the space is back we don't know exactly what that's going to look like we don't we don't

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:47.600
want it to be us doing a booth podcast like this forever that that's not the permanent

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:52.000
this doesn't represent our dream this isn't our fantasy but then you would say well what

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.960
is your dream what is your fantasy and we would say we're not sure I don't think that

01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:01.760
whatever we were doing before represented me thinking we were nailing it which is why

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:06.280
maybe for me it's it's easier to go oh fuck it we're doing it from this booth from now

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:14.560
on Viva de France and maybe people are going what the fuck because you but but I all I can

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:25.680
say is we're open to anything internally we're going to try to like we're working on getting

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:31.920
the venue back up that's not because we think that the show should be what it was before

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:39.200
we also don't think this is ideal we don't know what the fuck we're doing we we want

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:44.800
to like we we're talking about maybe like we'll go around California and do like crazy

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:54.200
like pop-up shows because that'll be fun like because we'll have an audience for that there's

01:21:54.200 --> 01:22:02.920
there's ways to make the VO booth version of the show more like worth fucking listening

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:08.360
to live I don't know but after you left that conversation actually it's not really the

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:12.720
subscribership that's in trouble it's actually the crazy thing is maybe a totally organic

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:16.960
thing which is that the people listening to the free version of the podcast it's just

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:23.280
plummeted after we transitioned which is just like an earthquake it's like well we our show

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:28.800
got canceled and there was no communication about you know why because that one gift that

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:34.320
Jane posted it was the fuck it was Jane yeah she fucking took it she fucking took it all

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:38.640
down I was hoping that we could mention her tonight in the tonight show because I definitely

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:50.880
did want to continue a insane cycle of whether or not yeah I don't I definitely was hoping

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:56.720
for sure and Steve and I are characters all right the dispensing of the character sheets

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:03.400
is happening yeah all right so Spencer I'm woefully unprepared I apparently don't have

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:08.400
my dice or my laptop so both my laptop is on my phone and my dice is going to be on

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:13.400
my phone phone dice all right but we didn't talk at all about what had happened we're

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:18.440
gonna we're gonna get to the bottom of this right now just let me just say that being

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:24.240
good in 2017 it's not always gonna be comfortable and we're not always gonna do the right thing

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:31.200
but it's always gonna be the wrong thing to just go oh that sucks I'll deal with it later

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.160
you know what look yeah we've been doing this podcast for a long time we've had a lot of

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:44.040
fun it's never been perfect it's very lazy and fly by night but we want the people listening

01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:51.160
to know that this we are all committed to finding out what the new better version of

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:57.720
this is and we're gonna do it I was talking about sexual assault oh oh oh no that's come

01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:06.600
on that's that's just gonna happen right all right that was a joke I know it's it's I mean

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:18.560
it's it's true though bark box is in your character she is it yeah yeah I had a conversation

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:22.600
with my therapist that I thought was so fucking fascinating because we've been to she's been

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:26.720
I think she may be using me as a case study because I'm like a straight white male and

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:33.040
like this shit is like in the psychological community this movement that's happening

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:39.680
right now people should know maybe that this is measurable and it is a real movement because

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:45.560
the people who get paid $200 a session to talk to you about what's fucking you up they're

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:50.720
all talking about it and these are snobs who do not normally pay attention to what you're

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:56.000
talking about they do not care they dismiss it as like pockets of this that and it has

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.080
disrupted their entire practice it has disrupted their calendar of how you're going to self

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:07.000
actualize and what and how couples interact particularly the Weinstein thing couples

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:14.920
therapists are experiencing this flood of women in couples saying yeah well here are

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:19.960
my assaults and the man and the couple going I didn't know that and then you go from there

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:24.760
into a yachtsie game or into a fucking like Candyland game of like you don't know like

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:29.800
because no one's ever communicated about it and everything is gone insane and I think

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:36.520
for that reason maybe my therapist is kind of fascinated with my like of like my point

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:42.080
of view like what's going on with it and I have like an I almost came like whatever we

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:45.400
should play D&D I don't want to I feel like I feel like me talking about the stuff is

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:51.160
why our subscribers like went away or listeners I think nothing is more helpful than for men

01:25:51.160 --> 01:26:00.360
talking about women's issues well that's a dumb cheap shot like we're all right about

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:06.880
everything I mean I had a conversation with my therapist about what I was experiencing

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:13.800
as a man about all this stuff and she was telling me as a gay person like what in it

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:19.720
like how it works being like feeling like you're part of a demographic that is under

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:26.360
a microscope and a thing that was crazy to me was what she taught she talked about like

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:31.000
well you know like when gay rights are like violated or when when things are coming up

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.320
in the news like some kid gets like handcuffed to a fence and beaten because he's gay or

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:42.640
something her explaining to me that there's like this fear if a gay person an individual

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:47.600
gay person is reading the newspaper and reads that story that beyond any outrage beyond

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:55.120
any like anything that there's like this weird shame that creeps in where it's like oh are

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:59.200
they it's not like are they coming for me next or maybe I shouldn't be gay it's just

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:04.240
sort of like when are they gonna stop looking at me when are they gonna stop paying attention

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:09.200
to me right like like and I was like I was so overwhelmed with her characterization

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:13.560
of it where I was like I was like oh man you know what I don't I don't think I ever understood

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:20.200
that I don't I think that everybody just intellectualizes like this stuff because it gets reduced

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:25.920
to like this like a strategic game of like oh I understand your outrage I understand

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:30.800
your anger I understand unfairness you work for this you should get that but like we were

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:34.640
not communicating about the thing that we could all relate to which is like holy fuck I hope

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:39.560
nobody kicks my fucking ass next I hope nobody fucking comes for me I hope I hope I didn't

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.680
make a bad choice did I make a choice should I be gay what's going on like I don't know

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:49.120
like it's not prideful they don't have gay fear parades they don't have it's like it's

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.840
not right it's not a right way to express anything and yet it's something we all share

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:59.040
like you worry about it and I was bursting the tears because I was like I didn't know

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:06.000
I didn't know you guys felt that way I didn't I I only understood that you'd be angry you

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.520
know I didn't I didn't know that you'd be like ashamed I didn't know that you'd react

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:14.680
to a story in a paper of somebody getting gaybashed with shame I thought you'd react with anger

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:23.840
and fear but not shame and I think that like anyways all right that's been our show thanks

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:29.400
for okay so we're in a forest and the fucking goblin attacked us whatever whatever you fucking

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:34.360

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:51.480
spent Spenny do you like do you like that that's one of several competing theories I'm

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:56.160
honestly trying to remember what happened you know bark box will send you a box of we went

01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:04.240
to close we went to placeholder and then we turned in our mission and the captain of

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:12.280
the of our police force kind of base we had a meeting with them well yeah that was the

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:18.440
most reason so if that's all you want to know oh for sure okay so here's what happened you

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:24.600
finished your mission that's what I pointed out no I know I know I'm sure oh to the camera

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:34.560
sorry sorry sorry I do a lot of drugs these days these days is it because he feels sad

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:42.080
about something that's beyond the cheese stain it's not well I mean I'm sure it is but really

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:50.680
I'm just trying to remember forget about the cheese thing so we'll catch Stevens Vegas I

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:55.560
wasn't mansplaining I was talking about a personal you got you got kind of teared up

01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:00.840
to you kind of high-roated I was I think I'm in like that I'm not like one of those guys

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:05.600
I'm not I'm special no but like I'm not saying it's not worthwhile talking about but a bunch

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:08.880
of guys talking about women's issues like that's all that's happening I'm not talking

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:13.200
about women's I'm talking yeah whatever but yeah no I was I was doing exactly what you

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:19.120
said I was taking a cheap shot and I I copped to that well when you're not around and you

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:24.000
don't take those cheap shots this show descends in a garbage so you must be doing something

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.560
right yeah I mean I wasn't gonna point it out but maybe they're the ratings dipped when

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:33.640
I wasn't here yeah I mean it point of fact that's what happened the question is and also

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:37.760
the stock market kept going up after Trump was elected we need to look at this stuff

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:43.040
closer you could have been part of the Schrab boost do you have any idea how hard it is

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:47.440
to maintain my composure when I know there's not enough spirit gum on this fucking beard

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:53.560
and it's popping and flopping it looks fine from most angles yeah I yeah if you're at

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:58.400
that angle it starts no I get it most people aren't gonna be viewing you at that I got

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:02.800
a party to go to where I have to be a character that nobody knows who I am three people saw

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:07.760
the the scrabble box last night and laughed that was three out of a thousand maybe not

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:12.600
as many people watch that show as I think now or it's been too long now it's all about

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:20.240
those stranger things all right okay do we still have time yeah loads of time all right

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:23.320
Spencer do you want to just do a recap or should I give you music how do you feel about

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:33.960
this whatever I'm gonna give you music because I like continuity there's a bug go away it's

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:40.040
the whole thing's a blackout you're a blackout right now no no no I mean well I may be feel

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:45.480
like a lot of my life has been a blackout the last five years maybe you should stop

01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:56.400
drinking Steve I know last time and undetermined amount of times before that our heroes were

01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:02.560
doing a mission oh boy they exercised a child and then they saved that child from a priest

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:08.040
that was trying to exercise the child they took the priest into custody custody where

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:13.520
they were going to take him back to the home base and you know what happened assassins

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:19.400
happened they came in and they stabbed up Patchens and they stabbed up Diarrhea Jr.

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:26.160
and the the prior ran away he was your captive and he ran away oh boy the assassins ran away

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:31.960
and it turned out they had a powerful gem that Patchens owned and he was besides himself

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:37.320
with rage that it was allowed to be taken from him you met up with this guy called

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:42.400
Geffen and he gave you back the prior and and you guys went back to the home base where

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:48.080
you turned in the mission and Patchens went to talk to the people and the prior went to

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:54.080
talk to the people and you told Patchens you'd meet him at a local tavern after the meeting

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:59.480
the captain said you can turn in your mission papers with Zellie at the commissary to get

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:07.600
paid brother Absalom was looking at you brother Absalom you met and he gave you an orangutan

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:20.600
ball there was an umber hole but it was non-canon hell yeah hey okay I have questions about

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:25.680
the uh what was the that's a great way to start off anyone have questions was the orangutan

01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:30.400
thing or what was that when you first ran back into pure burn abbey um you met brother

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:35.800
Absalom right and he he was like yo what up and then you were like weren't you working

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.200
on that thing to get us not have to sign all this paperwork and he was like yeah here you

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:45.440
go here's an orangutan ball someone's an orangutan all right and was that at that time did we

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:51.600
regard that as a random response um it it seemed like the kind of thing that was someone

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:58.160
trying to yes and an improv you made right okay fair enough all right so uh we're off

01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:03.280
to skull and bone the bar right to go talk to Patchens or something like that yeah and

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:08.360
to be clear so my drunken question is so we didn't get like a new mission from anybody

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:13.560
we're like done and we're in a flux here not yet although you had been told that you could

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:19.280
collect your paycheck in that brother Absalom had been looking for you oh let's go get our

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:24.560
paycheck then where do we find you wanted to meet back well what where do we find brother

01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:31.200
Absalom he's in his lab let's go to the lab and get paid he doesn't pay out you go to

01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:58.800

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:04.040

01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:49.000

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:08.520
a lot to me if we could accompany you and try to make good on all the horrible things that have

01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:14.840
happened to you because we've entered your life if you um either way whether you want to want us

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:21.480
to help you out or not I want to give you my slingshot to help you on your journey with or

01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:27.720
without us awesome you got to let me know now because I got to go get my buds my best buds

01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:34.920
listen I appreciate your help it hasn't been very helpful I'm gonna leave

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:41.080
you guys deal with the results of your actions all right we'll take my slingshot so you can always

01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:49.400
remember us all right okay I go back to the skull and bone we he he tells us what just happened

01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:55.480
and we have a little pow wow is does that wait a minute no come on I want I want him to tell us

01:49:55.480 --> 01:50:01.800
okay yeah hey how'd it go did you find patches what's going on hey guys what's what you know

01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:09.560
break it down for us I talked to I went back and then the I got yelled at patches what you found

01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:14.600
patches I found patches in a corner and he was really scared corner of what just the corner of

01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:21.000
the commissary and and he was just he really doesn't want anything to do with us anymore

01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:28.200
so I gave him my slingshot and I told him he didn't want help he definitely did not want our help

01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:35.560
oh cool so you said would you like our help and he said no yeah and he was he didn't say anything

01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:42.200
passive aggressive like well you haven't helped that much so far or you've your help hasn't

01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:45.640
turned out that good yeah something a passive aggressive people say where they really want

01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:52.600
you to help he made it abundantly clear that you said no I got this covered I'm totally

01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:57.240
confident person no no he didn't seem confident right but he also I don't know that we were

01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:02.200
additive in any way so he seemed like he needed help but also didn't want to owe us anything and

01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:08.120
just wanted to make us feel guilty and help him I think that he felt more like if we went with him

01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:13.480
we would royally fuck it up for him like he had better chances without us right because he was

01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:20.520
doing so good with his artifact by guarding a door yeah you just sleep in overrun by vampires

01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:26.440
all right well sounds like should we follow him doesn't sound like it I mean if you told me

01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:29.720
something different like if you were able to convey nuance to me like that would make it clear

01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:34.920
that he actually wanted our help well I mean I would say let's go follow him yeah well he was I

01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:39.560
asked him I was like well what are the stakes and he was like let personally in my life and death but

01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:47.080
also the whole world right and I feel like you said do you want help and he was like no yeah

01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:53.960
really that's unequivocal about it he said no he didn't say uh from my experience doesn't seem

01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:58.120
like you guys helped that much because that would be a different answer I mean he did do that too

01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:03.000
oh okay he did that too yeah he was which means he did that instead because he can't do both I

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.720
don't know you can't be definitive and I really got the sense that it wasn't passive aggression

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:13.240
he was just very mad and very scared and very upset and really didn't think we were helpful I say

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:20.120
I say fuck him let him do his own thing yeah like we're gonna go find passions gem yeah no

01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:24.360
it I mean not when he's gonna make it difficult to help him I mean I'm not like I'm in this for the

01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:29.960
ambitious you know glory and stuff but like what the the the the adventure of passions gem doesn't

01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:33.880
really sound like a well what if I know the adventure of passions gem sounds like an amazing

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:39.640
adventure the adventure of convincing passions that he needs help well sounds like the first 40

01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:45.240
years of my fucking life what if we man who knew too little to him and like we're in this in the

01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:50.200
shadows and making everything happen and he just thought he was doing well I I don't think we're

01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:56.600
talented enough to do what do we like the so like he's Inspector Crusoe and we're fate yeah I don't

01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:03.160
think we've graduated to that level oh look look I'm just blue skying here how about this why don't

01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:09.400
we walk back back to the to the abbey or wherever we go and talk and see like we need a new mission

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:14.040
obviously because we're basically homeless we got 20 gold burning the hole in our pocket but that's

01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:18.680
a lot we don't need a new mission should we put it on black hey guys we work for the church

01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:24.600
militant and we got you know we have a we took an oath we have a job to do why don't we have

01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:28.920
this why don't we go back find out they have a new job for us if it sounds less interesting than

01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:38.520
the adventure of passions gem uh then we take we go we go shadow passions around I don't think

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:43.080
shadowing passions is going to be a realistic option if we wait five more minutes especially

01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:49.720
who do we talk to about finding a new mission for us uh brother absalom okay why don't we go back

01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:54.680
and talk to brother absalon and then we'll tell him about passions and see what he thinks about

01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:02.600
I will can I I don't want to be negative nelly but one of the reasons why we didn't bring passions

01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:07.400
up in the first place is because when we were debriefing passions made it very clear to me

01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:13.720
that he doesn't want the church of the silver flame knowing about his ish right

01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:21.560
that that was clear so if you care about passions oh that would have been good to mention the recap

01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:25.320
that that's yeah that's great that you remember that's accurate though right no no I know that's

01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:30.040
great I didn't I didn't I let I let passions have as though it was a it was a thing like I I knew

01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:34.520
that passions didn't want us talking about because he'd been big shit trouble with the uh with the

01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:39.320
church it wasn't quite sure but I decided like I like this passions kid he helped us a lot

01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:45.320
like if I were up to me I'd like to help him you know I don't know if diarrhea is an unreliable

01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:50.760
narrator like if I if I heard a kid say if he was like dragging his feet and going like no I don't

01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:57.160
need any help don't need anybody I'd be like well I'm 40 so I think you do need help and that's cool

01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:01.400
because when I was 20 that's how I talked to when I needed help but I said that's why I said

01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:05.880
did he say no or was he a little fucking shlubby about it because if he's shlubby about it let's

01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:11.240
go chase this kid down and save him from himself uh maybe I'm just bad with people was he a little

01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:15.160
shlubby yeah maybe it was a little shlubby his little mealy mouth his little like indirect like

01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:19.880
well well basically when it all comes down dude I don't even know yeah yeah all right well let's go

01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:25.800
get the kid right yeah he's our friend you know what the more I say it because I said it now twice

01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:34.360
but the more I say the adventure of Patchens gem it just it seems like a if I was in a bookstore

01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:41.240
and I saw that on a book I go I'm fucking give that a read it sounds like at least one

01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:47.320
Anjanu's gonna get her first kiss in that adventure yeah and maybe it'll be us uh no it's a little

01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:53.000
okay so I'm in other words in that conversation I'm kind of like oh Patchens that's why I was

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:57.880
asking him that stuff I was like did he say no or was he kind of like poopy face about it now I'm

01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:05.000
like I'm like in the middle of my drink I'm like all right look I want to go find him let's all run

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.680
out and go see if we can get to the bottom of this with Patchens yeah we run out to look for

01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:15.800
Patchens Spencer all right uh who's got the best perception probably it might be Dan I have a four

01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:22.440
oh I think it is leave no I've got 11 Jackson my name is Steve I mean diarrhea I call Spencer

01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:28.680
Jackson because that's because that's what you do when you have 11th perception as a human I don't

01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:34.440
have enough perception to find it on my character sheet is that kind of your skills it's alphabetical

01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:43.800
p all right you're looking for Patchens you don't see him shit three that's not bad okay he's uh

01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:50.040
he's clearly left the abbey the keep the which way was he headed well he's got to be heading

01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:58.360
toward where the thieves went that direction right what no which way was he headed I didn't

01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:07.000
really get a good look what do you mean which way was he headed well I did you see him walk off

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:12.920
no I left before he did oh great okay where did you see him last right here behind this little

01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:19.000
bush it's behind this bush I look around around the bush not a bush you're inside I look around

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:27.720
inside the bush yeah you see it's like a small nook where a short person could hide I'm really

01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:32.840
scouring on the level that a person without perception could would achieve the result that

01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:39.400
he'd have if he had a high perception um just looking at every fucking inch and centimeter of

01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:47.400
the area you see uh fingernail marks like someone was digging into it like uh trying to climb up

01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:58.280
it or something interesting okay I just yell patch it you do that

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:07.880
don't wonder you guys have like a I can turn into a spirit bird or that's shadow can you

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:12.760
talk to animals there might be something that you guys can do can you conjure one and talk to it and

01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:18.840
have it I certainly can't well it looks like we lost passions I mean and I think that anyone

01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:22.920
listening would agree that we did the best we could hang on I might be able to conjure up some

01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:32.040
