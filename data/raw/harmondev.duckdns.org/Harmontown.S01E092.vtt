{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:24.720\nHello everybody, welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California!\n\n00:24.720 --> 00:33.720\nHarmontown is now in session. Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon!\n\n00:43.720 --> 00:51.720\nThank you. Thank you for coming out. You're all wonderful. Let's figure everything out.\n\n00:51.720 --> 00:57.720\nHow are you, Dan? I'm good. I just came from doing the treatment with Elvis Mitchell.\n\n00:57.720 --> 01:10.720\nCalifornians will know what I'm talking about, KCRW, Elvis Mitchell. Very wily and unexpectedly deep researcher in terms of his interviews.\n\n01:10.720 --> 01:16.720\nI don't know, I can't figure that guy out. He was asking me questions about comic books I wrote in the 90s.\n\n01:16.720 --> 01:23.720\nIt was weird. Weird how? He did so much research?\n\n01:23.720 --> 01:30.720\nIt was very insightful and asking strange questions that had never been asked.\n\n01:30.720 --> 01:38.720\nI had heard him interview people before. I was always fantasized about being a guest of his one day.\n\n01:38.720 --> 01:44.720\nMaybe I'll be a writer and I'll be interviewed by this guy who interviews writers.\n\n01:44.720 --> 01:54.720\nSomebody had told me, yeah, he draws weird parallels and connects weird dots that may or may not be there but you.\n\n01:54.720 --> 02:04.720\nThen he did. He was talking about how all of my work was about sensitivity, exposed nerves. That's what he kept saying.\n\n02:04.720 --> 02:10.720\nI kept saying it's about humanity versus systems. That's what I always thought.\n\n02:10.720 --> 02:18.720\nBut he kept saying exposed nerves, which I guess, yeah, I don't know.\n\n02:18.720 --> 02:24.720\nI feel like you have exposed nerves. Well everyone does. What does that even mean? I don't know.\n\n02:24.720 --> 02:29.720\nIt feels like I just hit one right now. What is that supposed to mean?\n\n02:29.720 --> 02:37.720\nIt was odd and insightful. I was on fire. Do you think it's a catchphrase of his that he's applied to lots of people?\n\n02:37.720 --> 02:41.720\nNo, God knows. Absolutely. He just gave you.\n\n02:41.720 --> 02:47.720\nI don't think he doesn't have catchphrases. He doesn't have catchalls that he uses with each individual guest.\n\n02:47.720 --> 02:56.720\nWith each guest, the gimmick seems to be that all of a sudden he's asking a question that's sort of like, oh yeah, I guess.\n\n02:56.720 --> 03:03.720\nI guess so. I guess. I don't know how to explain it. Listen to it. I'm plugging it. I was happy with the interview.\n\n03:03.720 --> 03:09.720\nThe other weird thing is it was at the house of the guy who created SpongeBob SquarePants.\n\n03:09.720 --> 03:15.720\nBut he wasn't on the show. It was just at his house. Is it always at his house? No, it's not.\n\n03:15.720 --> 03:20.720\nIs he always host from a different... No, he just not always host from a house. And no, there's not...\n\n03:20.720 --> 03:27.720\nIt was pulled up at a giant house, the kind of house you'd expect to have if you created SpongeBob SquarePants.\n\n03:27.720 --> 03:35.720\nA giant pineapple. Rolled in. And there were... There's just all these people. I guess they're KCRW donors.\n\n03:35.720 --> 03:50.720\nKind of well-heeled, liberal types. Like kind of ersatz Tim Robbins' and eating prosciutto and things and drinking the lightful Campari drinks.\n\n03:50.720 --> 03:59.720\nThey were low-budged Tim Robbins? Well, I wouldn't call them low-budged. Well, I'm saying non-Tim Robbins Tim Robbins.\n\n03:59.720 --> 04:06.720\nHandsome old men with gray feathered hair. But just not... They weren't in the hide-sucker proxy. Yeah, exactly.\n\n04:06.720 --> 04:12.720\nThere were actors. I'm sure there were a lot of them were captains of industry or something. They were all patrons of public...\n\n04:12.720 --> 04:18.720\nAll hanging out at the creator of SpongeBob's house? All at SpongeBob's house. Even though SpongeBob, who I talked to...\n\n04:18.720 --> 04:24.720\nI don't think he likes to be called SpongeBob. He was just like...\n\n04:24.720 --> 04:30.720\nYeah, it's at my house, man. Good to have you here. He was there like...\n\n04:30.720 --> 04:42.720\nYeah, but only because his wife was like... I think she's into... I think from talking to him when I gleaned is his wife is very active in that community.\n\n04:42.720 --> 04:53.720\nAnd so offered up their home as a venue. The high-falutin liberal writer type community or what community?\n\n04:53.720 --> 05:00.720\nWell, I don't know. These people were... I believe they were primarily donors. They were like people who really keep KCRW going.\n\n05:00.720 --> 05:12.720\nYeah, I got you, yeah. So just a... Still the strangest... I said to Elvis Mitchell when I got there, well, I've listened to your show a bunch of times.\n\n05:12.720 --> 05:20.720\nI've heard you interview people. I've never... I didn't know that when I was listening to it, you were in a living room full of middle-aged...\n\n05:20.720 --> 05:30.720\nTimsters. I never picked up on that. He said, oh, no, we've never done this before. I was like, okay, all right, I'll see you on the ice.\n\n05:30.720 --> 05:41.720\nAnd we just sat in front of a fireplace surrounded by delightful primarily caucasoid...\n\n05:41.720 --> 05:51.720\nPeople kind of just sitting enthralled at every little word I had to say about how I was angry at executives and how humanity should fight the system.\n\n05:51.720 --> 05:55.720\nIt was invigorating. Did you ever get like a back rub from anybody?\n\n05:55.720 --> 06:02.720\nThere was a point where Elvis started rubbing me, but it was radio, so you won't be able to tell from listening.\n\n06:02.720 --> 06:13.720\nAnd I didn't feel like I was allowed to say no, which is fucked up. But I also don't feel like I'm allowed to say that.\n\n06:13.720 --> 06:23.720\nBut also, you have a lot of exposed nerves. What do you mean? But it was nice. It was interesting.\n\n06:23.720 --> 06:35.720\nAnd I felt very articulate. I went up and I stumbled over my words very little. I felt like I was in a room full of my parents or something.\n\n06:35.720 --> 06:39.720\nAnd I had to rise to the level of my cardigan.\n\n06:39.720 --> 06:47.720\nI'm not saying this to be glib. Had you drunk less? Did you show up a little bit?\n\n06:47.720 --> 06:53.720\nNo, I had like three of these wonderful drinks they made that were Kampare grapefruit drinks.\n\n06:53.720 --> 06:58.720\nI don't know if I was less drunk than I usually am at four in the afternoon.\n\n06:58.720 --> 07:02.720\nI'm asking, was it a gig? You go like, you know, I'm going to have a...\n\n07:02.720 --> 07:10.720\nNo, I wasn't. If anything, I was a little panicked about how sober I was because I was like, I don't want my brain to get in the way of what's going on here.\n\n07:10.720 --> 07:16.720\nI've got a lot of weird class issues and stuff. Living room full of rich people listening to me.\n\n07:16.720 --> 07:20.720\nDo you make any friends outside of Elvis? I don't make...\n\n07:20.720 --> 07:27.720\nFriends, I don't know what that means. You be like, a snowman? Like you go in the front yard? How do you make a friend?\n\n07:27.720 --> 07:31.720\nYou and these white people on the couch with the gray hair and the back ribs.\n\n07:31.720 --> 07:34.720\nWas there an after party? Did you guys...\n\n07:34.720 --> 07:36.720\nThere was a mingling.\n\n07:36.720 --> 07:39.720\nIn my mind, the sun goes down and you guys are in the tub.\n\n07:39.720 --> 07:41.720\nIt gets back an alien.\n\n07:41.720 --> 07:44.720\nHey guys, there's a room full of swim trunks. We've got all sizes. Whatever you want.\n\n07:44.720 --> 07:50.720\nBut I was really taken and a little put off by how handsome everyone was.\n\n07:50.720 --> 07:54.720\nBecause they're all over 50 and they all look under 30.\n\n07:54.720 --> 07:59.720\nAnd I'm 41 and I look 60. And I felt like that was okay.\n\n07:59.720 --> 08:04.720\nBut the guy that created SpongeBob's got a 15-year-old kid and I won't drop his age.\n\n08:04.720 --> 08:07.720\nHe told me how old he was and I was shocked.\n\n08:07.720 --> 08:10.720\nYou know, it's weird when somebody tells you how old they are and you're...\n\n08:10.720 --> 08:14.720\nMy response was like, holy shit! But I forgot to say,\n\n08:14.720 --> 08:16.720\nI'm saying that because you look young.\n\n08:16.720 --> 08:19.720\nSo somebody goes like, I'm 52 and you go, wow!\n\n08:19.720 --> 08:21.720\nFuck! Jesus Christ!\n\n08:21.720 --> 08:22.720\nHoly smoke!\n\n08:22.720 --> 08:25.720\nWhat's that like?\n\n08:25.720 --> 08:30.720\nBut there's a... I mean, people that are...\n\n08:30.720 --> 08:36.720\nI don't know, they must eat algae and not drink and just walk in a treadmill and do crunches, fight crime.\n\n08:36.720 --> 08:38.720\nI don't know what they do.\n\n08:38.720 --> 08:40.720\nYour faces look like little kendals.\n\n08:40.720 --> 08:43.720\nWe've both been to parties full of rich white people.\n\n08:43.720 --> 08:46.720\nPeople with lots of money tend to age well.\n\n08:46.720 --> 08:48.720\nThey get really good health care and shit.\n\n08:48.720 --> 08:50.720\nYeah, so the guy that created SpongeBob...\n\n08:50.720 --> 08:53.720\nThey take a lot of vacations, they get some vitamin D and stuff like that.\n\n08:53.720 --> 08:55.720\nThey know how to...\n\n08:55.720 --> 08:57.720\nAnd I wonder, does that mean they're going to live to 150?\n\n08:57.720 --> 09:00.720\nOr does that mean, as Erin said, no, they're going to die when you die,\n\n09:00.720 --> 09:02.720\nbut they're going to do so gracefully.\n\n09:02.720 --> 09:04.720\nThey'll probably die 20 years later too, by the way.\n\n09:04.720 --> 09:07.720\nBut I mean, they'll have a better quality of life.\n\n09:07.720 --> 09:09.720\nHe looks like Davey Jones.\n\n09:09.720 --> 09:12.720\nThe guy that created SpongeBob, he is like...\n\n09:12.720 --> 09:15.720\nThe number of his age is like, you're like,\n\n09:15.720 --> 09:18.720\nwow, you should have thrown in the towel biologically.\n\n09:18.720 --> 09:23.720\nIt's a couple years older than me, but it's like, I associate it with like, fuck it.\n\n09:23.720 --> 09:26.720\nLike, you should be wearing Kleenex boxes on your feet,\n\n09:26.720 --> 09:31.720\nand you should be flipping off traffic and shooting your TV with a 38\n\n09:31.720 --> 09:33.720\nand fucking checking out, man.\n\n09:33.720 --> 09:35.720\nAnd he looks like Davey Jones.\n\n09:35.720 --> 09:37.720\nI did that show a long time ago.\n\n09:37.720 --> 09:39.720\nYeah, and he looks great.\n\n09:39.720 --> 09:41.720\nIt's amazing to me.\n\n09:41.720 --> 09:43.720\nI get a little jealous, I guess.\n\n09:43.720 --> 09:45.720\nI should eat some kale or something.\n\n09:45.720 --> 09:51.720\nI feel like the secret, for the wealthy people that I know that have awesome lives,\n\n09:51.720 --> 09:54.720\nthey spend a lot of their time on vacation.\n\n09:54.720 --> 09:57.720\nThere's lots of like, Riviera's and things.\n\n09:57.720 --> 09:59.720\nYou're on a boat a lot.\n\n09:59.720 --> 10:01.720\nHere's somebody who's...\n\n10:01.720 --> 10:04.720\nTo me, this is a truly remarkable...\n\n10:04.720 --> 10:06.720\nI wish there was a way we could...\n\n10:06.720 --> 10:10.720\nSomebody Wikipedia Stan Winston and tell me how old he is.\n\n10:10.720 --> 10:12.720\nIs that the special effects guy?\n\n10:12.720 --> 10:13.720\nYeah.\n\n10:13.720 --> 10:14.720\nHe was on a...\n\n10:14.720 --> 10:17.720\nWe're watching the newest season of King of the Nerds.\n\n10:17.720 --> 10:19.720\nRemember when we had Genevieve Pearson on the show?\n\n10:19.720 --> 10:21.720\nShe was a contestant on King of the Nerds.\n\n10:21.720 --> 10:23.720\nThere's a new season of that.\n\n10:23.720 --> 10:26.720\nStan Winston comes out with a robot he built or whatever.\n\n10:26.720 --> 10:27.720\nHe looks like a fuck...\n\n10:27.720 --> 10:29.720\nHe looks like Tony Hawk or something.\n\n10:29.720 --> 10:34.720\nI have been to his old house many times because Ryan Stiles from Hooseline bought his old house in L.A.\n\n10:34.720 --> 10:35.720\nI think he recently sold.\n\n10:35.720 --> 10:39.720\nAnd his house is up in this old house that he got rid of.\n\n10:39.720 --> 10:41.720\nYou'd be young if you had this house.\n\n10:41.720 --> 10:46.720\nIt's up in the valley side of the Hollywood Hills like towards Encino.\n\n10:46.720 --> 10:51.720\nThere's a backyard that if you were the guy in the world that could throw a football the farthest,\n\n10:51.720 --> 10:53.720\nyou couldn't throw a football out of that yard.\n\n10:53.720 --> 11:00.720\nAnd it was like the front of it looked like if Bilbo Baggins was as tall as Gandalf.\n\n11:00.720 --> 11:05.720\nIt looked like a shire home except the person that lived there was 11 feet tall.\n\n11:05.720 --> 11:09.720\nWe have shared units of measure like acres and yards.\n\n11:09.720 --> 11:10.720\nIf you...\n\n11:10.720 --> 11:12.720\nYou don't have to...\n\n11:12.720 --> 11:13.720\nNobody knows...\n\n11:13.720 --> 11:14.720\nNo, I see...\n\n11:14.720 --> 11:15.720\nFuck you because...\n\n11:15.720 --> 11:16.720\nNo, no, no.\n\n11:16.720 --> 11:17.720\nIf I said...\n\n11:17.720 --> 11:20.720\nDan, it was 14,000 square feet.\n\n11:20.720 --> 11:21.720\nYou would go...\n\n11:21.720 --> 11:22.720\nYou wouldn't know what I was talking about.\n\n11:22.720 --> 11:23.720\nYou would say...\n\n11:23.720 --> 11:24.720\nYou would say how many hobbits?\n\n11:24.720 --> 11:25.720\nHow many Gandalfs?\n\n11:25.720 --> 11:28.720\nIf I was a Gandalf, how many hobbits?\n\n11:28.720 --> 11:29.720\nHow dare you?\n\n11:29.720 --> 11:30.720\nAll right.\n\n11:30.720 --> 11:32.720\nYou hit my exposed nerve, you son of a bitch.\n\n11:32.720 --> 11:33.720\nI really do.\n\n11:33.720 --> 11:35.720\nIt's a house there from the front.\n\n11:35.720 --> 11:39.720\nYou go, that looks like a nice beautiful like Bilbo Baggins Eve Gandalf house.\n\n11:39.720 --> 11:40.720\nAnd you get inside it.\n\n11:40.720 --> 11:42.720\nYou can get lost in the cocksucker.\n\n11:42.720 --> 11:44.720\nYou can actually hang a wrong turn.\n\n11:44.720 --> 11:47.720\nAnd you go, okay, I do remember how to get back to the wine cellar.\n\n11:47.720 --> 11:50.720\nI know that there was a pool table, but you can't.\n\n11:50.720 --> 11:53.720\nAnd I think it's not all...\n\n11:53.720 --> 11:55.720\nThe old comic...\n\n11:55.720 --> 12:00.720\nIf you go to Pottery Barn, if you're lucky enough to get it before they sell out of the five\n\n12:00.720 --> 12:08.720\nthat they keep on the counter, Jeff's album of covers of classics, it's called Lost in the Cocksucker.\n\n12:08.720 --> 12:12.720\nIt's so beautiful.\n\n12:12.720 --> 12:13.720\nYou're not...\n\n12:13.720 --> 12:16.720\nIt's not original stuff, but you really bring new life into...\n\n12:16.720 --> 12:17.720\nI'd say it's all...\n\n12:17.720 --> 12:19.720\nIt's only a paper moon.\n\n12:19.720 --> 12:20.720\nI do sound assailants.\n\n12:20.720 --> 12:21.720\nIt's good stuff.\n\n12:21.720 --> 12:24.720\nIt's mostly zither.\n\n12:24.720 --> 12:26.720\nBut I feel like...\n\n12:26.720 --> 12:32.720\nThe comic Joe E. Lewis from the 2030s I said, he said, money isn't everything, but it calms the nerves a little.\n\n12:32.720 --> 12:34.720\nAnd I think that there's a thing about wealth.\n\n12:34.720 --> 12:35.720\nIf you're not...\n\n12:35.720 --> 12:36.720\nWealth can also destroy you.\n\n12:36.720 --> 12:42.720\nWealth can turn you into a scruge and a concussion and weaken your cells, I think,\n\n12:42.720 --> 12:45.720\nif all you care about is competition.\n\n12:45.720 --> 12:50.720\nOur people, and I think in our world, this little enclave that we live in,\n\n12:50.720 --> 12:52.720\nI don't meet rich tycoons.\n\n12:52.720 --> 12:54.720\nI don't meet entrepreneurs and shit.\n\n12:54.720 --> 12:58.720\nI meet rich comedians and singers and stuff like that.\n\n12:58.720 --> 13:00.720\nI think it may be the art that keeps them young.\n\n13:00.720 --> 13:08.720\nBut I think there's a way to grow old gracefully, and certainly money doesn't hurt.\n\n13:08.720 --> 13:10.720\nSpeaking of...\n\n13:10.720 --> 13:12.720\nNo, fuck that.\n\n13:12.720 --> 13:18.720\nAll right, so here's a new segment called, what am I doing?\n\n13:18.720 --> 13:20.720\nWhat's Dan Harmon doing?\n\n13:20.720 --> 13:22.720\nSo the most boring segment we've ever done.\n\n13:22.720 --> 13:23.720\nLet's get it out of the way.\n\n13:23.720 --> 13:24.720\nDo you have a boring song?\n\n13:24.720 --> 13:25.720\nA boring song?\n\n13:25.720 --> 13:27.720\nThat song I almost started the show with.\n\n13:27.720 --> 13:42.720\nWhat's Dan Harmon doing this week on a schedule?\n\n13:42.720 --> 13:47.720\nSo tomorrow morning I'm going in.\n\n13:47.720 --> 13:50.720\nYou guys may have seen me on Twitter or the whatnot,\n\n13:50.720 --> 13:56.720\nmaking fun of the fact that there's this Dungeons & Dragons anthology on tape coming out, on tape.\n\n13:56.720 --> 14:00.720\nIt's on ceramic disc, I think.\n\n14:00.720 --> 14:02.720\nOn audible bit bites.\n\n14:02.720 --> 14:06.720\nIce-T did this Dungeons & Dragons thing.\n\n14:06.720 --> 14:11.720\nAnd he was interviewed about it, I guess he was saying things like,\n\n14:11.720 --> 14:13.720\nYes, weirdest thing I ever read.\n\n14:13.720 --> 14:17.720\nIt's a bunch of gobbledygook.\n\n14:17.720 --> 14:20.720\nI've been doing my impression of Ice-T.\n\n14:20.720 --> 14:27.720\nStignots the orc came down the mountain wielding his axe plus three.\n\n14:27.720 --> 14:29.720\nIt wasn't personal.\n\n14:29.720 --> 14:31.720\nIt was business.\n\n14:31.720 --> 14:33.720\nWait, can I pause real quick?\n\n14:33.720 --> 14:34.720\nSure.\n\n14:34.720 --> 14:38.720\nBecause I currently have 14 questions.\n\n14:38.720 --> 14:42.720\nQuestion number one, a dungeon master, he's narrating?\n\n14:42.720 --> 14:43.720\nHe's reading an outline?\n\n14:43.720 --> 14:45.720\nHe's reading an audible book.\n\n14:45.720 --> 14:50.720\nIt's a D&D book.\n\n14:50.720 --> 14:54.720\nThanks a lot.\n\n14:54.720 --> 15:01.720\nWhat a lighthouse.\n\n15:01.720 --> 15:05.720\nIn my stammering, the only words I had were D&D book.\n\n15:05.720 --> 15:07.720\nLike a player's guide or a monster manual?\n\n15:07.720 --> 15:11.720\nAdam?\n\n15:11.720 --> 15:16.720\nOkay, Adam.\n\n15:16.720 --> 15:18.720\nThey're not saying boo, they're saying Adam.\n\n15:18.720 --> 15:21.720\nI was saying boo.\n\n15:21.720 --> 15:26.720\nHe's doing a D&D novel and he talked on his podcast, which he now has,\n\n15:26.720 --> 15:30.720\nabout how motherfuckers have maps for places that don't even exist.\n\n15:30.720 --> 15:32.720\nIt's ridiculous.\n\n15:32.720 --> 15:38.720\nI read this to my D-group and we named our group places that don't motherfucking exist.\n\n15:38.720 --> 15:40.720\nDid someone put him up to this or something genius producers say?\n\n15:40.720 --> 15:42.720\nHe has a bad agent.\n\n15:42.720 --> 15:44.720\nI don't know, because it's not like he wants for money,\n\n15:44.720 --> 15:47.720\nalthough in other interviews he's said that he basically,\n\n15:47.720 --> 15:49.720\nJoel McHale is like this.\n\n15:49.720 --> 15:54.720\nSometimes no matter how much money you have, you might be driven by a work ethic.\n\n15:54.720 --> 15:55.720\nMaybe Ice-T has this.\n\n15:55.720 --> 15:57.720\nMaybe he's Irish, I don't know.\n\n15:57.720 --> 16:01.720\nHe wanted to get a book out so everybody would know that his voice should not just be on comedy bang bang.\n\n16:01.720 --> 16:06.720\nAnyways, I tweeted about it and I was so taken with the idea of Ice-T.\n\n16:06.720 --> 16:10.720\nThen a day, a Dutchess of the Dragons book on tape.\n\n16:10.720 --> 16:14.720\nThe next day I get an email inviting me to be one of the people.\n\n16:14.720 --> 16:16.720\nOn Ice-T's D&D thing?\n\n16:16.720 --> 16:20.720\nWell, it's not, I will be a label mate with Ice-T, you would say.\n\n16:20.720 --> 16:22.720\nWhat the fuck?\n\n16:22.720 --> 16:26.720\nSo they ask, will you come in and do this thing and I'm doing it tomorrow morning.\n\n16:26.720 --> 16:28.720\nHere are my other label mates.\n\n16:28.720 --> 16:31.720\nHere are the other people that are doing, that are reading the thing.\n\n16:31.720 --> 16:33.720\nMichael Chickliss.\n\n16:33.720 --> 16:34.720\nNice.\n\n16:34.720 --> 16:36.720\nNow I'm gonna breeze through some names that maybe you know.\n\n16:36.720 --> 16:38.720\nFelicia Day.\n\n16:38.720 --> 16:40.720\nMelissa Roche.\n\n16:40.720 --> 16:42.720\nRoche.\n\n16:42.720 -->

Ice-T's project?\n\n17:37.720 --> 17:38.720\nNo, it's not Ice-T's project.\n\n17:38.720 --> 17:39.720\nThey got them to read the books.\n\n17:39.720 --> 17:40.720\nThey all write the books.\n\n17:40.720 --> 17:42.720\nThey brought him in and now they're bringing me in.\n\n17:42.720 --> 17:43.720\nWho is this thing?\n\n17:43.720 --> 17:46.720\nIt's a kind of fellowship of, like,

Danny Pudi, they were, at the time of this email,\n\n17:57.720 --> 17:59.720\nthey were going to try to get Danny Pudi.\n\n17:59.720 --> 18:01.720\nDavid Duchovny.\n\n18:01.720 --> 18:03.720\nIs it a television project?\n\n18:03.720 --> 18:05.720\nNo, it's audio books.\n\n18:05.720 --> 18:06.720\nIt's reading a thing.\n\n18:06.720 --> 18:08.720\nIt's a book on tape.\n\n18:08.720 --> 18:10.720\nYou said pilot.\n\n18:10.720 --> 18:12.720\nI didn't say pilot.\n\n18:12.720 --> 18:13.720\nOh, I heard pilot.\n\n18:13.720 --> 18:14.720\nSorry.\n\n18:14.720 --> 18:17.720\nIce-T came in, chapter

not looking good for Tordek the Dwarf.\n\n18:30.720 --> 18:35.720\nA moderate heel-wounds spell took care of the last of the concerns.\n\n18:35.720 --> 18:36.720\nSo you'll...\n\n18:36.720 --> 18:39.720\nHowever, business remained.\n\n18:39.720 --> 18:42.720\nSo he'll do that, and then I'm going to come in and be like,\n\n18:42.720 --> 18:45.720\nmeow, also, here's another thing.\n\n18:45.720 --> 18:47.720\nThat was a really good Dan Harmon.\n\n18:47.720 --> 18:48.720\nAll right, thank you.\n\n18:48.720 --> 18:51.720\nAdam Goldberg, thanks for coming out there.\n\n18:51.720 --> 18:52.720\nAdam, really?\n\n18:52.720 --> 18:53.720\nYeah.\n\n18:53.720 --> 18:55.720\nI mean, boy, that couldn't have happened from the audience.\n\n18:55.720 --> 18:59.720\nThey call him the elucidator.\n\n18:59.720 --> 19:03.720\nDan, I wonder, first off, a couple things.\n\n19:03.720 --> 19:06.720\nFull disclosure, I like your Ice-T impression quite a bit.\n\n19:06.720 --> 19:07.720\nThank you.\n\n19:07.720 --> 19:09.720\nThat's a very good Ice-T impression.\n\n19:09.720 --> 19:11.720\nIt's nothing personal, Jeff.\n\n19:11.720 --> 19:14.720\nIt's just business.\n\n19:14.720 --> 19:17.720\nI would like to hear a brief conversation\n\n19:17.720 --> 19:22.720\nbetween Ice-T and Vincent Price, though.\n\n19:22.720 --> 19:25.720\nJust so I can hear the...\n\n19:25.720 --> 19:28.720\nHow many Gandalfs of distance are in between...\n\n19:28.720 --> 19:31.720\nSo you're saying Ice-T is coming over to Vincent Price's house.\n\n19:31.720 --> 19:33.720\nHe's been invited over for dinner?\n\n19:33.720 --> 19:34.720\nCertainly, yeah.\n\n19:34.720 --> 19:35.720\nYeah, whatever you want.\n\n19:35.720 --> 19:38.720\nAnd he doesn't know that for dinner sometimes means I'm going to eat you.\n\n19:38.720 --> 19:44.720\nI would say that Elvis Mitchell is going to be doing an interview,\n\n19:44.720 --> 19:46.720\nbut this time it's at Vincent Price's house.\n\n19:46.720 --> 19:48.720\nYou've been asked over and you didn't realize...\n\n19:48.720 --> 19:52.720\nIce-T didn't realize that he was coming into Vincent Price's home.\n\n19:52.720 --> 19:55.720\nDing dong.\n\n19:55.720 --> 19:57.720\nDamn.\n\n20:02.720 --> 20:06.720\nTakes a long time for them to come to the door.\n\n20:10.720 --> 20:13.720\nHello.\n\n20:13.720 --> 20:16.720\nThe fuck?\n\n20:16.720 --> 20:20.720\nI'm here to do the Elvis Mitchell documentary.\n\n20:20.720 --> 20:23.720\nYes.\n\n20:23.720 --> 20:27.720\nI hope you'll enjoy doing...\n\n20:27.720 --> 20:31.720\nI think you're trying to not be Ice-T.\n\n20:31.720 --> 20:33.720\nI'm not saying you're identical.\n\n20:33.720 --> 20:36.720\nI'm saying that their Olympic rings overlap a tiny bit.\n\n20:36.720 --> 20:39.720\nIce-T, I presume.\n\n20:39.720 --> 20:42.720\nPlease come into my house.\n\n20:42.720 --> 20:46.720\nI'm Vincent Price.\n\n20:46.720 --> 20:50.720\nAll right, but it's nothing personal.\n\n20:50.720 --> 20:54.720\nNo, it's business.\n\n20:54.720 --> 20:55.720\nI...\n\n20:55.720 --> 20:57.720\nYou know what we should do.\n\n20:57.720 --> 20:59.720\nI think at some point Ice-T should start rapping\n\n20:59.720 --> 21:04.720\nand Vincent Price could do one of his famous thriller-style breakdowns.\n\n21:06.720 --> 21:08.720\nYo, yo, yo.\n\n21:08.720 --> 21:10.720\nIce-T.\n\n21:10.720 --> 21:13.720\nIce-T gonna get with me.\n\n21:13.720 --> 21:17.720\nI got the tippy to the two, got the four to the three.\n\n21:17.720 --> 21:20.720\nIce-T, you're gonna put sweetener in me.\n\n21:20.720 --> 21:23.720\nCop killer on the front to the four-three.\n\n21:23.720 --> 21:26.720\nAspect ratio, 16-9.\n\n21:26.720 --> 21:29.720\nI got the high definition and it's gonna be mine.\n\n21:29.720 --> 21:31.720\nI go down to Best Buy.\n\n21:31.720 --> 21:33.720\nI go down every aisle.\n\n21:33.720 --> 21:36.720\nI go look at VCRs by the mile saying,\n\n21:36.720 --> 21:40.720\nWill this one have a tracking problem?\n\n21:40.720 --> 21:42.720\nI don't know.\n\n21:42.720 --> 21:46.720\nI got slob phlegm in my mouth when I get a cold.\n\n21:46.720 --> 21:53.720\nI wanna go home and watch the old people roll past my porch.\n\n21:53.720 --> 21:56.720\nYo, there's Larry Storch.\n\n21:56.720 --> 21:59.720\nHe's an actor from Hawaii 5-0.\n\n21:59.720 --> 22:03.720\nI don't need your husbands or wives to go to Google it\n\n22:03.720 --> 22:05.720\nand verify my reference.\n\n22:05.720 --> 22:08.720\nI just wanna rap and experience your deference\n\n22:08.720 --> 22:11.720\ncause I'm OG to the OG-O.\n\n22:11.720 --> 22:15.720\nThat means original gangster got an old in the go.\n\n22:15.720 --> 22:18.720\nI don't know what it spells all day,\n\n22:18.720 --> 22:21.720\nbut I'm Ice Mother fucking T and I'm not gay.\n\n22:21.720 --> 22:24.720\nGot a cop killer bullet in my penis for a gun.\n\n22:24.720 --> 22:27.720\nGonna, gonna rub it till I start to cum\n\n22:27.720 --> 22:29.720\nand when the sperm comes out,\n\n22:29.720 --> 22:31.720\ngonna pierce the armor of a cop\n\n22:31.720 --> 22:34.720\nand then you know I went farther than\n\n22:34.720 --> 22:38.720\nI should have gone, should have left it back\n\n22:38.720 --> 22:40.720\nwhen I rhymed a couple times.\n\n22:40.720 --> 22:43.720\nYo, yo, I'm Ice T rapping hard\n\n22:43.720 --> 22:48.720\nand now it's time for me to do the Vincent Price bridge.\n\n22:48.720 --> 22:51.720\nSpiders and skeletons\n\n22:51.720 --> 22:54.720\ncoming out of your closet\n\n22:54.720 --> 22:58.720\non a spooky hallows eve.\n\n22:58.720 --> 23:01.720\nThe mind reels with scariness.\n\n23:01.720 --> 23:05.720\nFogs and fogs of scary souls\n\n23:05.720 --> 23:09.720\nblood in buckets of wolves howls.\n\n23:09.720 --> 23:12.720\nOn an howl's eve.\n\n23:12.720 --> 23:13.720\nCop killer.\n\n23:13.720 --> 23:14.720\nYo, yeah.\n\n23:14.720 --> 23:16.720\nCop killer.\n\n23:16.720 --> 23:19.720\nYeah, that's all.\n\n23:19.720 --> 23:22.720\nI couldn't tell the difference.\n\n23:22.720 --> 23:26.720\nIf Ice T didn't tell you Vincent Price was coming in,\n\n23:26.720 --> 23:28.720\nthat could have been a very confusing album.\n\n23:28.720 --> 23:32.720\nThere's a reason why, when Vincent Price got the Michael Jackson call\n\n23:32.720 --> 23:36.720\nhe's like, who wants me to do a bridge in their popular song?\n\n23:36.720 --> 23:39.720\nIs it one of those people I sound like?\n\n23:39.720 --> 23:40.720\nNo, this is Michael Jackson.\n\n23:40.720 --> 23:43.720\nLet me hear a recording of him.\n\n23:43.720 --> 23:47.720\nAll right, okay, I'll do it.\n\n23:47.720 --> 23:49.720\nIce T wants you to do it.\n\n23:49.720 --> 23:50.720\nLet me hear.\n\n23:50.720 --> 23:53.720\nYo, Ice T, no, I won't do it.\n\n23:53.720 --> 23:57.720\nOkay, that was a long walk for...\n\n23:57.720 --> 23:59.720\nSometimes I tell you a joke and then I explain it.\n\n23:59.720 --> 24:02.720\nLarry Storch was on Hawaii 5-0?\n\n24:02.720 --> 24:04.720\nI think so.\n\n24:04.720 --> 24:06.720\nI'm going to go F-True.\n\n24:06.720 --> 24:07.720\nHe's on F-True.\n\n24:07.720 --> 24:09.720\nI told you not to look it up.\n\n24:09.720 --> 24:10.720\nIce T told you.\n\n24:10.720 --> 24:14.720\nI would love to find out that Larry Storch was also on Hawaii 5-0.\n\n24:14.720 --> 24:15.720\nIt's nothing personal.\n\n24:15.720 --> 24:19.720\nIt's just business.\n\n24:19.720 --> 24:23.720\nThe Harmontown documentary is going to be at South by Southwest.\n\n24:23.720 --> 24:25.720\nI forgot to mention that last week.\n\n24:25.720 --> 24:26.720\nGo see it.\n\n24:26.720 --> 24:28.720\nWe want to fill that theater.\n\n24:28.720 --> 24:30.720\nDo we know what's going to happen with it?\n\n24:30.720 --> 24:34.720\nOr are they waiting for the festival people to decide how that will be released,\n\n24:34.720 --> 24:36.720\ndistributed, shown?\n\n24:36.720 --> 24:37.720\nOh, no.\n\n24:37.720 --> 24:40.720\nYeah, the idea of these festivals is you show it and then,\n\n24:40.720 --> 24:44.720\nI guess, probably Harvey Weinstein will come up afterwards and go,\n\n24:44.720 --> 24:50.720\nI think America is ready to watch a movie about a fat alcoholic baby.\n\n24:50.720 --> 24:53.720\nDo nothing.\n\n24:53.720 --> 24:59.720\nLet's put this in 50,000 theaters.\n\n24:59.720 --> 25:04.720\nBarring that happening, I think it'll be in the fans' hands.\n\n25:04.720 --> 25:06.720\nI think it's a very interesting movie.\n\n25:06.720 --> 25:07.720\nI'll say one thing.\n\n25:07.720 --> 25:11.720\nIt's a very fairer portrayal of me, which is a bummer for me.\n\n25:11.720 --> 25:14.720\nBut that was up to you, because this thing has gone through zillions of cuts,\n\n25:14.720 --> 25:18.720\nbut you kept going in there saying, no, let's not pull the punches on that.\n\n25:18.720 --> 25:19.720\nWell, don't mischaracterize that.\n\n25:19.720 --> 25:21.720\nA lot of people online are wondering about that,\n\n25:21.720 --> 25:23.720\nand I think it'll be very clear, and it will be made very clear,\n\n25:23.720 --> 25:25.720\nbecause my name's not an executive producer,\n\n25:25.720 --> 25:27.720\nbut I think it'll be very clear when you see it\n\n25:27.720 --> 25:29.720\nthat I couldn't possibly have had final cut.\n\n25:29.720 --> 25:35.720\nThe deal I made with Neil was for the feels and the wheel.\n\n25:35.720 --> 25:38.720\nDo you dig?\n\n25:38.720 --> 25:42.720\nThe deal I made with Neil was it's my tour, it's his movie,\n\n25:42.720 --> 25:45.720\nand I wanted to be able to try to help him,\n\n25:45.720 --> 25:48.720\nand there were a couple moments where he's doing a bit.\n\n25:48.720 --> 25:51.720\nHe's saying, hey, look at that thing across the room,\n\n25:51.720 --> 25:56.720\nand I'm able to say, you should cut to that thing here,\n\n25:56.720 --> 26:00.720\nand it'll get a bigger laugh than what you're getting right now\n\n26:00.720 --> 26:01.720\nif you change it by eight frames.\n\n26:01.720 --> 26:04.720\nBut I am not allowed, I wish I was allowed,\n\n26:04.720 --> 26:06.720\nwhich is why I can't be allowed to say,\n\n26:06.720 --> 26:09.720\nhey, you know that part where I'm really abusive to my girlfriend?\n\n26:09.720 --> 26:11.720\nLet's lift that.\n\n26:11.720 --> 26:14.720\nIt would make a shittier movie,\n\n26:14.720 --> 26:19.720\nand also, yeah, I would be doing it for the wrong reasons.\n\n26:19.720 --> 26:22.720\nI think it's an interesting documentary.\n\n26:22.720 --> 26:23.720\nI can't tell.\n\n26:23.720 --> 26:24.720\nI'm required to hate myself,\n\n26:24.720 --> 26:26.720\nrequired to be bored by myself.\n\n26:26.720 --> 26:28.720\nI watch the movie, I go, I'm always kind of riveted.\n\n26:28.720 --> 26:30.720\nI've talked to people who've seen it, they go,\n\n26:30.720 --> 26:31.720\nI want to see the whole thing.\n\n26:31.720 --> 26:33.720\nI saw it kind of with Kate, and I watched it,\n\n26:33.720 --> 26:34.720\nand he's like, do you have any notes?\n\n26:34.720 --> 26:36.720\nI'm like, no, I was in it.\n\n26:36.720 --> 26:39.720\nMy only note is I wish I could see the entire tour.\n\n26:39.720 --> 26:41.720\nIt made me feel nostalgic.\n\n26:41.720 --> 26:42.720\nWhich I think people will be able to.\n\n26:42.720 --> 26:44.720\nI think there's like 700 hours of things,\n\n26:44.720 --> 26:46.720\nincluding like 25 minutes of John Oliver.\n\n26:46.720 --> 26:49.720\nThat would be worth $5 right there.\n\n26:49.720 --> 26:52.720\nThere's whole, I mean, this guy shot a lot of shit.\n\n26:52.720 --> 26:55.720\nThey could show 17 hours of us singing Pringles Dick\n\n26:55.720 --> 26:57.720\nand Chicken Noodle Dick.\n\n26:57.720 --> 27:01.720\nYeah, I think what emerges is a very, very, very\n\n27:01.720 --> 27:07.720\ninteresting portrait of a 41-year-old idiot\n\n27:07.720 --> 27:11.720\nthat doesn't know what he's doing at all.\n\n27:11.720 --> 27:17.720\nYeah, but I think it's interesting.\n\n27:17.720 --> 27:21.720\nThere's a depth to it, too, that it has to do with the fans.\n\n27:21.720 --> 27:23.720\nThat's my favorite part.\n\n27:23.720 --> 27:26.720\nI don't think you can spoil that, but the best part about it,\n\n27:26.720 --> 27:29.720\nthere's interviews after lots of the shows\n\n27:29.720 --> 27:31.720\nwith a bunch of people that came to the shows,\n\n27:31.720 --> 27:35.720\nand I've seen several different cuts and clips of that,\n\n27:35.720 --> 27:37.720\nand it always really chokes me up.\n\n27:37.720 --> 27:40.720\nIt's really sweet and emotional.\n\n27:40.720 --> 27:42.720\nYeah, so if you're within the sound of my voice,\n\n27:42.720 --> 27:44.720\nplease come to that premiere.\n\n27:44.720 --> 27:47.720\nWhatever theater we're in, I think we're in a huge theater,\n\n27:47.720 --> 27:49.720\nand I want to fill that thing.\n\n27:49.720 --> 27:51.720\nThere's a podcast, then we're watching the movie,\n\n27:51.720 --> 27:52.720\nand then we're all going to go out.\n\n27:52.720 --> 27:54.720\nI think so, yeah.\n\n27:54.720 --> 27:57.720\nWell, are we sure about that?\n\n27:57.720 --> 27:59.720\nI don't know if we're sure about that yet.\n\n27:59.720 --> 28:00.720\nNo, I don't know.\n\n28:00.720 --> 28:02.720\nI mean, because they were emailing me going,\n\n28:02.720 --> 28:04.720\nlike, oh, the venue might be changing and all this stuff.\n\n28:04.720 --> 28:08.720\nAnyways, why don't we put the onus on the bonus\n\n28:08.720 --> 28:10.720\nand bring out Mitch Hurwitz.\n\n28:10.720 --> 28:12.720\nOh!\n\n28:12.720 --> 28:19.720\nYo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n28:19.720 --> 28:22.720\nOh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.\n\n28:22.720 --> 28:24.720\nMitch Hurwitz, Arrested Development.\n\n28:24.720 --> 28:27.720\nGonna fuck your mama, then give her a breath mint.\n\n28:27.720 --> 28:29.720\nGonna fuck your mama, gonna do a Netflix.\n\n28:29.720 --> 28:30.720\nOh, that's so nice.\n\n28:30.720 --> 28:32.720\nFuck your mama with a hundred of my squid dicks.\n\n28:32.720 --> 28:33.720\nOh, this is wonderful.\n\n28:33.720 --> 28:35.720\nArrested Development.\n\n28:35.720 --> 28:37.720\nFuck you for a season of paint and rent.\n\n28:37.720 --> 28:39.720\nRubber stream that shit.\n\n28:39.720 --> 28:40.720\nRub and Williams break down.\n\n28:40.720 --> 28:42.720\nRub and Williams break down.\n\n28:42.720 --> 28:44.720\nOh, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n28:44.720 --> 28:46.720\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n28:46.720 --> 28:48.720\nOh, no.\n\n28:48.720 --> 28:49.720\nThat's all I wanted.\n\n28:49.720 --> 28:50.720\nThat's all I wanted.\n\n28:50.720 --> 28:51.720\nThat's all I wanted.\n\n28:51.720 --> 28:53.720\nWill you remember any of this tomorrow?\n\n28:53.720 --> 28:56.720\nWill you, like, will you hear this podcast and say something?\n\n28:56.720 --> 28:57.720\nIt's a loaded question.\n\n28:57.720 --> 28:59.720\nWill you hear the podcast and say,\n\n28:59.720 --> 29:02.720\nI do not remember singing about VCR tracking.\n\n29:02.720 --> 29:03.720\nDo you even remember now?\n\n29:03.720 --> 29:05.720\nNo, I'm sober as a...\n\n29:05.720 --> 29:07.720\nNo, it's not that.\n\n29:07.720 --> 29:09.720\nIt's just that it was such stream of consciousness.\n\n29:09.720 --> 29:10.720\nThat was so impressive.\n\n29:10.720 --> 29:11.720\nThat's why my rap...\n\n29:11.720 --> 29:12.720\nOh, my God.\n\n29:12.720 --> 29:13.720\nCan you not freestyle, Mitch?\n\n29:13.720 --> 29:14.720\nHave you ever tried?\n\n29:14.720 --> 29:16.720\nNo, I really haven't.\n\n29:16.720 --> 29:18.720\nI think everybody's tried at one point.\n\n29:18.720 --> 29:19.720\nI don't know that I want to start tonight.\n\n29:19.720 --> 29:21.720\nEverybody's tried to handle it at a freestyle.\n\n29:21.720 --> 29:24.720\nI was telling people today, like, Mike Schneider, a TV guide,\n\n29:24.720 --> 29:26.720\nyou know that fella?\n\n29:26.720 --> 29:27.720\nI like Mike.\n\n29:27.720 --> 29:28.720\nYeah, he's right.\n\n29:28.720 --> 29:29.720\nHe has his moments.\n\n29:29.720 --> 29:32.720\nI was explaining that you and I were now best friends.\n\n29:32.720 --> 29:34.720\nI don't want to smother you.\n\n29:34.720 --> 29:36.720\nOnly on stage when we keep it that way.\n\n29:36.720 --> 29:37.720\nLike, we just don't even...\n\n29:37.720 --> 29:38.720\nWe won't even look at each other.\n\n29:38.720 --> 29:40.720\nTalking about the intimidating, like, nature of,\n\n29:40.720 --> 29:42.720\nlike, when you're...\n\n29:42.720 --> 29:43.720\nOh, this is ridiculous.\n\n29:43.720 --> 29:45.720\nNo, I'll put you on the spot.\n\n29:45.720 --> 29:47.720\nYou really, like, encapsulate wittiness.\n\n29:47.720 --> 29:48.720\nIt's really ridiculous.\n\n29:48.720 --> 29:49.720\nOh, God, no.\n\n29:49.720 --> 29:50.720\nNo.\n\n29:50.720 --> 29:51.720\nYou don't remind me...\n\n29:54.720 --> 29:55.720\nNo, I have nothing.\n\n29:55.720 --> 29:56.720\nThat's...\n\n29:56.720 --> 29:57.720\nNo, it occurred to me halfway through\n\n29:57.720 --> 29:58.720\nthat it's such a ridiculous thing to say\n\n29:58.720 --> 29:59.720\nto somebody on stage.\n\n29:59.720 --> 30:00.720\nOh, this is pretty nice.\n\n30:00.720 --> 30:01.720\nBut I'm so sorry.\n\n30:01.720 --> 30:02.720\nI'm so sorry.\n\n30:02.720 --> 30:04.720\nI was just talking to your fiancée.\n\n30:04.720 --> 30:05.720\nFiancée.\n\n30:05.720 --> 30:06.720\nRight, the two A's.\n\n30:06.720 --> 30:07.720\nWho are you, Marrior?\n\n30:07.720 --> 30:09.720\nNo, well, listen.\n\n30:09.720 --> 30:11.720\nI mean, I think if we're going there already.\n\n30:13.720 --> 30:15.720\nBut anyway, I was just making out with...\n\n30:15.720 --> 30:17.720\nI was just talking to your...\n\n30:17.720 --> 30:20.720\nAnd she said you were so articulate today.\n\n30:20.720 --> 30:23.720\nLike, the soul of dropping here, yeah.\n\n30:23.720 --> 30:24.720\nYeah.\n\n30:24.720 --> 30:26.720\nI feel more comfortable with 45-year-old people\n\n30:26.720 --> 30:27.720\nwith gray in their hair.\n\n30:27.720 --> 30:28.720\nNo kidding.\n\n30:28.720 --> 30:29.720\nI was a little...\n\n30:29.720 --> 30:31.720\nI wasn't thrilled backstage listening to kind of\n\n30:31.720 --> 30:34.720\nsounded maybe like dissing, you know,\n\n30:34.720 --> 30:35.720\nwhite people that have some money.\n\n30:35.720 --> 30:36.720\nI felt like that was...\n\n30:36.720 --> 30:39.720\nMaybe older people kind of felt like...\n\n30:39.720 --> 30:40.720\nI think it's okay to pull it through.\n\n30:40.720 --> 30:42.720\nThat could hurt somebody's feelings.\n\n30:44.720 --> 30:45.720\nIt really hurts.\n\n30:45.720 --> 30:47.720\nThere's no danger there of anything happening, though.\n\n30:47.720 --> 30:48.720\nIf you're going to have a target.\n\n30:48.720 --> 30:51.720\nWas Elvis Mitchell being very thoughtful with you?\n\n30:51.720 --> 30:52.720\nWhat's he like in front of an audience?\n\n30:52.720 --> 30:53.720\nHe was deep.\n\n30:53.720 --> 30:54.720\nHas he ever interviewed you?\n\n30:54.720 --> 30:55.720\nNo, but I listened to his interviews\n\n30:55.720 --> 30:58.720\nand he'll be talking about the movie EZA.\n\n30:58.720 --> 31:00.720\nHow has he never interviewed you?\n\n31:00.720 --> 31:01.720\nYeah, fired up.\n\n31:01.720 --> 31:02.720\nWhat?\n\n31:02.720 --> 31:03.720\nYou've never...\n\n31:03.720 --> 31:04.720\nI'm surprised by that.\n\n31:04.720 --> 31:05.720\nNo.\n\n31:05.720 --> 31:06.720\nNo.\n\n31:06.720 --> 31:07.720\nMitch, do you feel...\n\n31:07.720 --> 31:08.720\nWell, why?\n\n31:08.720 --> 31:09.720\nBecause my name's Mitchell?\n\n31:09.720 --> 31:10.720\nIs that why you just thought that would be like...\n\n31:10.720 --> 31:11.720\nYeah, because you created a list of topics.\n\n31:11.720 --> 31:13.720\nWe could do 10 minutes on the name.\n\n31:13.720 --> 31:15.720\nYou know, I don't...\n\n31:15.720 --> 31:16.720\nNo.\n\n31:16.720 --> 31:17.720\nI haven't done it.\n\n31:17.720 --> 31:18.720\nI talked to Terry Gross once.\n\n31:18.720 --> 31:19.720\nWhat?\n\n31:19.720 --> 31:20.720\nYeah.\n\n31:20.720 --> 31:21.720\nFuck you.\n\n31:21.720 --> 31:22.720\nDid you talk to Terry Gross?\n\n31:22.720 --> 31:23.720\nNo.\n\n31:23.720 --> 31:24.720\nAnd right in the middle of it, she said,\n\n31:24.720 --> 31:25.720\nthis is fresh air.\n\n31:25.720 --> 31:26.720\nAnd it really was like...\n\n31:26.720 --> 31:29.720\nYou know, it was like Hendricks playing the\n\n31:29.720 --> 31:30.720\nNational Anthem or something.\n\n31:30.720 --> 31:31.720\nIt was like...\n\n31:31.720 --> 31:32.720\nThere it is!\n\n31:32.720 --> 31:33.720\nNo.\n\n31:33.720 --> 31:34.720\nThat's the answer.\n\n31:34.720 --> 31:37.720\nThe reason why Elvis Mitchell's never sat down with you is\n\n31:37.720 --> 31:38.720\nbecause he's local.\n\n31:38.720 --> 31:39.720\nYou're big league.\n\n31:39.720 --> 31:41.720\nAnd he's black, right?\n\n31:41.720 --> 31:42.720\nIs he black?\n\n31:42.720 --> 31:43.720\nI didn't notice.\n\n31:43.720 --> 31:45.720\nI don't see that kind of thing.\n\n31:45.720 --> 31:47.720\nI guess come to think of it, I suppose, yeah.\n\n31:47.720 --> 31:48.720\nWell, I have a problem.\n\n31:48.720 --> 31:50.720\nYou know, I have that problem with black.\n\n31:50.720 --> 31:51.720\nRight.\n\n31:51.720 --> 31:52.720\nNo.\n\n31:52.720 --> 31:53.720\nSo I'm not gonna be part of it.\n\n31:53.720 --> 31:54.720\nElvis Mitchell's black?\n\n31:54.720 --> 31:55.720\nYes.\n\n31:55.720 --> 31:56.720\nI think he is.\n\n31:56.720 --> 31:57.720\nBut Dan would know.\n\n31:57.720 --> 31:58.720\nOh, you really should know.\n\n31:58.720 --> 32:02.720\nNow that you mention it, yes, he was.\n\n32:02.720 --> 32:05.720\nI admire your restraint in not bringing that up earlier.\n\n32:05.720 --> 32:06.720\nThat's the first sentence.\n\n32:06.720 --> 32:09.720\nThe first time you've ever had an encounter with a black person\n\n32:09.720 --> 32:11.720\nyou didn't say the word black in the first sentence.\n\n32:11.720 --> 32:14.720\nI mean, I don't think we can forget, you know, the impression\n\n32:14.720 --> 32:15.720\nof iced tea.\n\n32:15.720 --> 32:16.720\nI don't think we should go.\n\n32:16.720 --> 32:17.720\nYou know what I mean?\n\n32:17.720 --> 32:19.720\nI don't think we should just let that go completely.\n\n32:19.720 --> 32:22.720\nThat is an accurate impression of iced tea.\n\n32:22.720 --> 32:23.720\nVery accurate.\n\n32:23.720 --> 32:30.720\nAnd any stereotypical landmines that I'm stepping on are attached to his feet.\n\n32:30.720 --> 32:31.720\nAbsolutely.\n\n32:31.720 --> 32:33.720\nHe sounds like that.\n\n32:33.720 --> 32:34.720\nYou're channeling something.\n\n32:34.720 --> 32:35.720\nIt's not personal.\n\n32:35.720 --> 32:36.720\nIt's just business.\n\n32:36.720 --> 32:44.720\nI love how it ends with iced tea.\n\n32:44.720 --> 32:49.720\nTelling me this lady was raped, then murdered.\n\n32:49.720 --> 32:54.720\nIt's SVU.\n\n32:54.720 --> 32:56.720\nIt's him on the crime scene.\n\n32:56.720 --> 32:58.720\nIt's a nasty city.\n\n32:58.720 --> 33:00.720\nWhat's you've been up to, Mitch?\n\n33:00.720 --> 33:03.720\nHim and his stand-up comic friend, Richard Belzer.\n\n33:03.720 --> 33:05.720\nWhat have I been up to?\n\n33:05.720 --> 33:08.720\nGod, I'm being held accountable for so many things.\n\n33:08.720 --> 33:12.720\nI'll tell you what, I watched House of Cards.\n\n33:12.720 --> 33:15.720\nThat really, that was fun.\n\n33:15.720 --> 33:18.720\nAre you, well, okay, let's talk about that.\n\n33:18.720 --> 33:19.720\nWell, I don't know.\n\n33:19.720 --> 33:20.720\nI can't say anything about it.\n\n33:20.720 --> 33:21.720\nI watched last season.\n\n33:21.720 --> 33:26.720\nLast season ended with him going jogging and turning off his Walkman or something.\n\n33:26.720 --> 33:29.720\nYou know, I had no recollection of what happened in the last season.\n\n33:29.720 --> 33:31.720\nIt was just sort of fun.\n\n33:31.720 --> 33:32.720\nIt was fun.\n\n33:32.720 --> 33:34.720\nIt was really, it was fun.\n\n33:34.720 --> 33:37.720\nAnd it helps, you know, it just helps you plan.\n\n33:37.720 --> 33:39.720\nIt's going to sound awful.\n\n33:39.720 --> 33:42.720\nBut anyway, it helps you plan your own murders.\n\n33:42.720 --> 33:47.720\nBecause you see how he plans it.\n\n33:47.720 --> 33:52.720\nIn case you haven't seen it, he kills a couple of people.\n\n33:52.720 --> 33:53.720\nNo, here's what I didn't get.\n\n33:53.720 --> 33:57.720\nActually, one of the things I didn't get about it, but I just don't get in life.\n\n33:57.720 --> 33:59.720\nAnd you kind of alluded to this earlier.\n\n33:59.720 --> 34:01.720\nLike, how much is too much?\n\n34:01.720 --> 34:02.720\nThere's one scene.\n\n34:02.720 --> 34:03.720\nHave you seen it?\n\n34:03.720 --> 34:04.720\nThe first season.\n\n34:04.720 --> 34:05.720\nYeah, right.\n\n34:05.720 --> 34:09.720\nThere's one scene where Gerald McRaney is talking, you know, they're threatening Gerald McRaney.\n\n34:09.720 --> 34:11.720\nThey say, we're going to shut down your power plants for two weeks.\n\n34:11.720 --> 34:12.720\nThat's going to be a lot of income.\n\n34:12.720 --> 34:14.720\nAnd I'm just always amazed by that.\n\n34:14.720 --> 34:18.720\nI used to talk to Ron Howard about that when we did a rest of the first time.\n\n34:18.720 --> 34:22.720\nAnd I said, you know, if I had directed Cocoon, that would have been it.\n\n34:22.720 --> 34:25.720\nI would have been like, you know, walking into restaurants and saying,\n\n34:25.720 --> 34:28.720\nMitchell Hurwoods, director of Cocoon.\n\n34:28.720 --> 34:33.720\nI certainly wouldn't be just out there doing another one every year.\n\n34:33.720 --> 34:34.720\nWhat do you say?\n\n34:34.720 --> 34:35.720\nI'm not sure.\n\n34:35.720 --> 34:37.720\nI don't understand what you're saying.\n\n34:37.720 --> 34:40.720\nWell, I'm just saying that that ruthless ambition.\n\n34:40.720 --> 34:41.720\nI don't know.\n\n34:41.720 --> 34:45.720\nIn all of us, these powerful men continue to play power games.\n\n34:45.720 --> 34:46.720\nYeah.\n\n34:46.720 --> 34:47.720\nYeah.\n\n34:47.720 --> 34:48.720\nThat always confuses the hell out of me.\n\n34:48.720 --> 34:51.720\nWhy is Rupert Murdoch continue to care?\n\n34:51.720 --> 34:52.720\nWhy?\n\n34:52.720 --> 34:53.720\nWhat?\n\n34:53.720 --> 34:56.720\nBecause they're competitive people and it's all about winning.\n\n34:56.720 --> 35:02.720\nThey're not used to being second to anything like Carnegie and Rockefeller and those guys.\n\n35:02.720 --> 35:04.720\nThey resent that someone has more money than them.\n\n35:04.720 --> 35:10.720\nAnd they're not measuring things in terms of like a quarter is not a quarter of a dollar.\n\n35:10.720 --> 35:12.720\nIt doesn't exist to them.\n\n35:12.720 --> 35:14.720\nI would say it certainly does.\n\n35:14.720 --> 35:16.720\nI think they know exactly what a quarter is.\n\n35:16.720 --> 35:19.720\nNo, but I mean, it doesn't represent a fourth of a load of laundry.\n\n35:19.720 --> 35:21.720\nIt doesn't translate into goods and services.\n\n35:21.720 --> 35:23.720\nIt's a measure of a video game.\n\n35:23.720 --> 35:27.720\nBut it represents that bit of mortar in the brick in the house that I built with my own two hands.\n\n35:27.720 --> 35:30.720\nNo, I don't think it's just a collection.\n\n35:30.720 --> 35:32.720\nI think it's just like collectors.\n\n35:32.720 --> 35:34.720\nAnd these guys aren't boot strappers.\n\n35:34.720 --> 35:36.720\nI mean, I don't care how many millions they were born with.\n\n35:36.720 --> 35:38.720\nThey were not born poor.\n\n35:38.720 --> 35:43.720\nSome of the rubber bears, I think, were working class.\n\n35:43.720 --> 35:46.720\nWell, maybe back before money was just being invented.\n\n35:46.720 --> 35:50.720\nMaybe a couple of them by Chirico Incidents didn't have enough because money hadn't been invented yet.\n\n35:50.720 --> 35:52.720\nBut money was pretty nice.\n\n35:52.720 --> 35:58.720\nI don't want to name names, but to today's tycoons, I guarantee you there's none of them that were born broke.\n\n35:58.720 --> 36:00.720\nOr we'd know their name.\n\n36:00.720 --> 36:03.720\nWe'd go like, that's the guy that was born broke and is now a tycoon.\n\n36:03.720 --> 36:08.720\nSome of them are very proud of the fact that they were only given 50 million to start their Whatchamacallit...\n\n36:08.720 --> 36:10.720\nOh, absolutely. That's Trump's story.\n\n36:10.720 --> 36:13.720\nHe took 50 million and turned it into a billion.\n\n36:15.720 --> 36:17.720\nFirst of all, you got to put it somewhere.\n\n36:17.720 --> 36:20.720\nYou could put that in a money market account. The same thing happens.\n\n36:20.720 --> 36:24.720\nAnd then you have a problem because you have more money and you got to put that somewhere.\n\n36:24.720 --> 36:28.720\nThat's why I say I don't like it when we take on people that are white and make money.\n\n36:28.720 --> 36:30.720\nIt's challenging.\n\n36:30.720 --> 36:32.720\nThat's it.\n\n36:32.720 --> 36:34.720\nThank you. Oh, nice.\n\n36:34.720 --> 36:36.720\nLike there's someone wealthy.\n\n36:36.720 --> 36:38.720\nHave you guys ever...\n\n36:40.720 --> 36:43.720\nHave Mitch, Dan, have the two of you ever hung out one-on-one?\n\n36:43.720 --> 36:45.720\nEver gone out and had a lunch or a thing?\n\n36:45.720 --> 36:47.720\nHow dare you?\n\n36:47.720 --> 36:49.720\nYeah.\n\n36:49.720 --> 36:51.720\nAre you asking about three ways?\n\n36:51.720 --> 36:53.720\nI'm just saying.\n\n36:53.720 --> 36:55.720\nTell them where we hung out, Mitch.\n\n36:55.720 --> 36:57.720\nI forget the name of the bar, but it was a bar.\n\n36:57.720 --> 36:59.720\nSpearmint Rhino?\n\n36:59.720 --> 37:01.720\nSpearmint Rhino?\n\n37:01.720 --> 37:03.720\nWe went to the dry bar together.\n\n37:03.720 --> 37:05.720\nGoddamnit.\n\n37:05.720 --> 37:07.720\nYou guys have never been to the dry bar.\n\n37:07.720 --> 37:09.720\nYou guys have never hung out together.\n\n37:09.720 --> 37:11.720\nI hung out at the dry bar with Mitch Hurwitz.\n\n37:11.720 --> 37:13.720\nWe just colluded together to come up with a story.\n\n37:13.720 --> 37:15.720\nHe forgot the name of the place.\n\n37:15.720 --> 37:17.720\nBecause he's never been there.\n\n37:17.720 --> 37:20.720\nHe's been in there. We had a wonderful conversation.\n\n37:20.720 --> 37:22.720\nHe and I are best friends.\n\n37:22.720 --> 37:24.720\nJeff has some jealousy issues.\n\n37:24.720 --> 37:27.720\nHe probably doesn't even know that I was the cop troller.\n\n37:27.720 --> 37:29.440\nWhen you were gone, he copped trouble.\n\n37:29.440 --> 37:31.280\nI listened to it and you were wonderful.\n\n37:31.280 --> 37:32.240\nThank you so much.\n\n37:32.240 --> 37:33.240\nThat is so big of me to say.\n\n37:33.240 --> 37:34.080\nDon't let him hide with you.\n\n37:34.080 --> 37:34.920\nThank you.\n\n37:34.920 --> 37:36.600\nAnd I think you're great.\n\n37:36.600 --> 37:37.440\nWell, thank you.\n\n37:37.440 --> 37:38.280\nYou've never listened to Mitch.\n\n37:38.280 --> 37:39.120\nYeah, it doesn't matter who did better.\n\n37:39.120 --> 37:40.480\nNo, no, this is not a jealousy thing.\n\n37:40.480 --> 37:41.960\nYou said earlier, Dan, that I said,\n\n37:41.960 --> 37:44.440\ndid you make any friends at the Elvis Mitchell thing?\n\n37:44.440 --> 37:45.280\nYou're like, that's a friend.\n\n37:45.280 --> 37:46.120\nYeah, I know.\n\n37:46.120 --> 37:46.960\nHow do you make a friend?\n\n37:46.960 --> 37:50.360\nBut I was like, are you a friend maker, Mitch?\n\n37:50.360 --> 37:51.240\nAre you a gregarious search?\n\n37:51.240 --> 37:52.560\nNo, I'm not, actually.\n\n37:52.560 --> 37:55.440\nI mean, every time you talk about me as being kind of like,\n\n37:55.440 --> 37:57.240\nyou'll say things like, boy, he's kind of, you know,\n\n37:57.240 --> 37:59.480\nhe doesn't look neurotic, or I don't know, whatever you say.\n\n37:59.480 --> 38:00.960\nAnd it's like, no, I'm so neurotic.\n\n38:00.960 --> 38:04.280\nAnd so, you know, if I'm out with people, I embrace that.\n\n38:04.280 --> 38:07.400\nI'm always happy about it, but it takes a lot to get me out.\n\n38:07.400 --> 38:09.600\nEven when you talk about going to San Francisco\n\n38:09.600 --> 38:11.080\nand doing this tour and everything.\n\n38:11.080 --> 38:12.640\nDo you want to come to my wedding?\n\n38:12.640 --> 38:13.760\nI'd love to officiate.\n\n38:13.760 --> 38:15.800\nAre you, do you need someone?\n\n38:15.800 --> 38:16.920\nThat gives me enough time.\n\n38:16.920 --> 38:18.080\nThat'd be great.\n\n38:18.080 --> 38:19.320\nI would.\n\n38:19.320 --> 38:23.040\nI will, you're on the short list now, for sure.\n\n38:23.040 --> 38:24.600\nI'll be great.\n\n38:24.600 --> 38:27.840\nAre you already ordained?\n\n38:27.840 --> 38:31.000\nNo, but I have time now, and I won't make it all about me.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:34.800\nI mean, you know, that'll be, some of it, obviously,\n\n38:34.800 --> 38:36.520\nI have to have an act, but,\n\n38:37.880 --> 38:39.760\ncould you, I mean, there has to be a little\n\n38:39.760 --> 38:42.240\nRobin Williams moments in the officiating.\n\n38:42.240 --> 38:43.080\nYeah, that's right.\n\n38:43.080 --> 38:44.880\nWell, I have a lot of props around.\n\n38:44.880 --> 38:45.720\nOkay.\n\n38:45.720 --> 38:47.240\nAnd I'll take a plunger and I'll be, you know, like,\n\n38:47.240 --> 38:48.920\noh, I'm a unicorn.\n\n38:48.920 --> 38:50.960\nIf I can't, that wasn't Robin Williams.\n\n38:50.960 --> 38:52.840\nSo, my favorite Robin Williams thing, though,\n\n38:52.840 --> 38:56.320\nis the, is the impression of the thing\n\n38:56.320 --> 38:59.720\nthat doesn't exist anymore, which is the preacher.\n\n38:59.720 --> 39:03.520\nYeah, you know, like, the preacher's still making fun\n\n39:03.520 --> 39:04.360\nof the preacher.\n\n39:04.360 --> 39:07.680\nLike, yeah, we're with you, we get it, we,\n\n39:07.680 --> 39:11.120\nhe's an asshole, he doesn't, what a hypocrite.\n\n39:12.920 --> 39:15.120\nThe, could you?\n\n39:15.120 --> 39:16.440\nNo, but I could marry the hell out of you.\n\n39:16.440 --> 39:19.040\nI know now, because I've been, I've been married.\n\n39:19.040 --> 39:20.880\nAll right, short list, it's like,\n\n39:20.880 --> 39:22.120\nthere's three people on the list,\n\n39:22.120 --> 39:22.960\nand then it's all controversy.\n\n39:22.960 --> 39:25.760\nI couldn't stop sweating when I got married.\n\n39:25.760 --> 39:26.600\nIt was awful.\n\n39:26.600 --> 39:29.400\nI was nervous beforehand, and I was in New York,\n\n39:29.400 --> 39:31.280\nand I thought, well, let me just go for a run,\n\n39:31.280 --> 39:32.720\nand that'll calm me down.\n\n39:32.720 --> 39:34.600\nAnd I went for a run, and, really,\n\n39:34.600 --> 39:36.520\nI went out into Central Park,\n\n39:36.520 --> 39:38.360\nand I ran around the whole rest of the park.\n\n39:38.360 --> 39:39.200\nYou see your tuxedo running?\n\n39:39.200 --> 39:40.200\nIn the tux?\n\n39:40.200 --> 39:43.520\nYeah, of course, because you wanted to fit and move with you.\n\n39:43.520 --> 39:44.680\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n39:44.680 --> 39:47.040\nNo, I just, just a full spandex bodysuit,\n\n39:47.040 --> 39:48.000\nand I just went out running.\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:48.840\nRight.\n\n39:48.840 --> 39:50.160\nJust for speed, you know.\n\n39:50.160 --> 39:52.960\nThis is back when you were a known strangler.\n\n39:52.960 --> 39:53.800\nYeah.\n\n39:53.800 --> 39:55.640\nThat's right.\n\n39:55.640 --> 39:57.160\nWell, I knew a lot of stranglers.\n\n39:57.160 --> 39:58.000\nI know what you're thinking of.\n\n39:58.000 --> 39:59.280\nNever convicted, but you were certainly\n\n39:59.280 --> 40:00.240\nunder investigation for many years.\n\n40:00.240 --> 40:02.800\nI remember I was jogging past those kids wilding.\n\n40:02.800 --> 40:04.480\nI was like, ah, kids.\n\n40:04.480 --> 40:05.960\nI just felt like part of the scene.\n\n40:05.960 --> 40:08.200\nAnyway, I came back, and I looked at the clock,\n\n40:08.200 --> 40:11.120\nand it was, I had like a half hour, and so I,\n\n40:11.120 --> 40:11.960\nand I panicked.\n\n40:11.960 --> 40:13.240\nYou know, I hadn't even tried on my tux,\n\n40:13.240 --> 40:15.120\nand I jumped in the shower, and I came out,\n\n40:15.120 --> 40:16.480\nand I'm still sweating.\n\n40:16.480 --> 40:18.920\nAnd then I put on the tux, and I had to walk like six blocks,\n\n40:18.920 --> 40:21.440\nand then get up on a hoopa, because at that point,\n\n40:21.440 --> 40:22.880\nI think I'd still believed in God,\n\n40:22.880 --> 40:26.440\nand we had this Jewish thing.\n\n40:26.440 --> 40:27.280\nHoopa's the thing.\n\n40:27.280 --> 40:28.120\nI'm gonna be honest about my-\n\n40:28.120 --> 40:28.960\nBut you know you're not supposed to get\n\n40:28.960 --> 40:29.800\non top of the hoopa.\n\n40:29.800 --> 40:31.680\nThat's like, you're not Gidget.\n\n40:31.680 --> 40:32.520\nWait, you-\n\n40:32.520 --> 40:33.360\nWhat?\n\n40:33.360 --> 40:35.120\nYou don't get on top of the hoopa?\n\n40:35.120 --> 40:36.640\nThat's why they were laughing.\n\n40:36.640 --> 40:40.000\nBut why it looked so triumphant.\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:40.960\nNo, did I say on top of it?\n\n40:40.960 --> 40:42.360\nNo, I was right, but I had to get under,\n\n40:42.360 --> 40:44.200\nI had to get on top of a stage under a hoopa,\n\n40:44.200 --> 40:46.000\nand then there was a light right here,\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:48.000\nand the whole time I was just like trying\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:49.520\nto casually wipe away.\n\n40:49.520 --> 40:51.560\nIt was like Albert Brooks, and you know,\n\n40:51.560 --> 40:54.080\njust look, and nothing says confidence\n\n40:54.080 --> 40:59.080\nabout getting married, like just a total flop sweat.\n\n40:59.760 --> 41:01.480\nNothing says confidence about wanting to get married,\n\n41:01.480 --> 41:03.160\nlike I should go take a run.\n\n41:03.160 --> 41:05.520\nYeah, I know, I know.\n\n41:05.520 --> 41:07.880\nLiterally my last run, I mean I just got-\n\n41:07.880 --> 41:09.480\nLiterally running away from the scene.\n\n41:09.480 --> 41:10.320\nYeah.\n\n41:10.320 --> 41:12.160\nDo you get in fights with your wife?\n\n41:13.520 --> 41:15.760\nYeah, kind of, I mean I've learned,\n\n41:15.760 --> 41:17.040\nI've learned a lot about,\n\n41:17.040 --> 41:20.640\nthis is what you do when, here's the move.\n\n41:20.640 --> 41:21.480\nMe!\n\n41:22.960 --> 41:25.320\nPut on some spandex to make your errands, not back there.\n\n41:25.320 --> 41:26.160\nJust run.\n\n41:27.040 --> 41:30.880\nSo nobody ever wants to apologize first when you have a fight.\n\n41:30.880 --> 41:32.400\nNot when your heart is pounding\n\n41:32.400 --> 41:33.960\nand your arteries are done.\n\n41:33.960 --> 41:35.160\nGo for it.\n\n41:35.160 --> 41:37.240\nYou go for it, you go for it.\n\n41:37.240 --> 41:39.120\nYou don't have to mean it,\n\n41:39.120 --> 41:44.120\nand it makes them feel so much worse than any insult,\n\n41:44.120 --> 41:47.400\nany insult, you know, how could you say that?\n\n41:47.400 --> 41:48.480\nHow could you say that?\n\n41:48.480 --> 41:49.800\nThere's a lot of that, by the way,\n\n41:49.800 --> 41:51.680\nbut we have a lot of complete,\n\n41:51.680 --> 41:54.440\nI just feel like every time, I feel like every time I,\n\n41:54.440 --> 41:57.680\nbut if you dive in with like,\n\n41:57.680 --> 42:02.680\nlook, I love you, I don't want you to be unhappy,\n\n42:02.800 --> 42:04.160\nso I'll take the blame.\n\n42:04.160 --> 42:05.360\nNo, I'll take the blame.\n\n42:05.360 --> 42:06.200\nOkay.\n\n42:06.200 --> 42:11.040\nYou know, they can't, many women can't apologize first,\n\n42:11.040 --> 42:13.000\nbut they can't resist.\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.920\nI feel like I was always so good at what you're describing,\n\n42:15.920 --> 42:18.960\nand I feel like,\n\n42:18.960 --> 42:21.440\nI don't know if this is justification, rationalization,\n\n42:21.440 --> 42:26.360\nbut I can't get out of that pit with Erin,\n\n42:26.360 --> 42:28.920\nand I have to assume it's because she intimidates me\n\n42:28.920 --> 42:29.840\nmore than anyone I've been with.\n\n42:29.840 --> 42:34.280\nI find, like, I can't, I always know that.\n\n42:34.280 --> 42:35.960\nI've always been able to do that.\n\n42:35.960 --> 42:39.680\nAlways been able to, like, find the high road immediately,\n\n42:39.680 --> 42:40.880\nand I can never do it.\n\n42:40.880 --> 42:44.440\nI get so, I'm so, like, mad.\n\n42:44.440 --> 42:45.880\nActions, only half-joking.\n\n42:45.880 --> 42:49.720\nI mean, I will say that one of the keys to, like,\n\n42:49.720 --> 42:51.920\nmy relationship being successful, I think,\n\n42:51.920 --> 42:53.000\nand by successful, I mean,\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:54.680\nshe lets me sleep with other women.\n\n42:54.680 --> 42:57.520\nSafe crack.\n\n42:57.520 --> 42:59.800\nYeah, I mean, that's a, that's a big success.\n\n42:59.800 --> 43:02.880\nThat's, once you overcome that hurdle,\n\n43:02.880 --> 43:05.120\nmatrimony becomes gravy.\n\n43:05.120 --> 43:05.960\nYeah.\n\n43:05.960 --> 43:07.760\nNo, that's not true.\n\n43:07.760 --> 43:09.920\nBut it really is kind of,\n\n43:09.920 --> 43:11.680\nit is doing what I just made a joke out of.\n\n43:11.680 --> 43:13.920\nIt's really trying to see that other person,\n\n43:13.920 --> 43:17.720\nbecause that's really what anybody wants, right,\n\n43:17.720 --> 43:19.320\nis to be seen, is to be acknowledged,\n\n43:19.320 --> 43:20.800\nand everything you're doing in a fight\n\n43:20.800 --> 43:22.520\nis sort of not seeing them,\n\n43:22.520 --> 43:24.200\nand I'm claiming you don't see me.\n\n43:24.200 --> 43:27.280\nSo when I, if I can remind myself of that,\n\n43:27.280 --> 43:29.480\nI actually can sort of think, like,\n\n43:29.480 --> 43:32.280\nI mean, look at your fiance.\n\n43:32.280 --> 43:33.120\nI refuse to.\n\n43:33.120 --> 43:34.800\nI know, that's a problem.\n\n43:35.800 --> 43:37.800\nAnd you just go, oh, I love her.\n\n43:38.800 --> 43:39.640\nI love her even though she's-\n\n43:39.640 --> 43:41.520\nYeah, she doesn't understand.\n\n43:41.520 --> 43:43.880\nAlso, it's like, it's like,\n\n43:43.880 --> 43:45.240\nI don't know anything about Pokemon,\n\n43:45.240 --> 43:46.800\nbut I know what it has something to do with weapons\n\n43:46.800 --> 43:48.360\nor something or choices of attacks.\n\n43:48.360 --> 43:51.240\nI'm doing a, I'm doing a whole audiobook on Pokemon.\n\n43:51.240 --> 43:52.560\nNext week.\n\n43:52.560 --> 43:54.560\nWith the Harlem Glow Trotters.\n\n43:54.560 --> 43:56.760\nQuinch that knew his tornado attack\n\n43:56.760 --> 43:59.720\nwould reduce his enemy to a confused state.\n\n43:59.720 --> 44:00.680\nDoing it.\n\n44:00.680 --> 44:02.080\nI'm doing it with three cards left.\n\n44:02.080 --> 44:05.520\nLayla Ali and I, that's Muhammad's daughter,\n\n44:05.520 --> 44:08.240\nare doing, yeah, she's, for whatever reason,\n\n44:08.240 --> 44:09.800\nthey put us together.\n\n44:09.800 --> 44:10.640\nYeah.\n\n44:10.640 --> 44:12.960\nI've done a show with Layla.\n\n44:12.960 --> 44:13.800\nYeah, not really.\n\n44:13.800 --> 44:14.640\nI swear to God.\n\n44:14.640 --> 44:15.680\nBut on Whose Lines Anyway,\n\n44:15.680 --> 44:16.880\nthey brought her out as a guest.\n\n44:16.880 --> 44:17.720\nOh my God.\n\n44:17.720 --> 44:19.520\nSo Wayne Brady and I had to sing a song to Layla Ali\n\n44:19.520 --> 44:20.600\nand she was awesome.\n\n44:20.600 --> 44:21.440\nShe was great.\n\n44:21.440 --> 44:22.280\nOh, that's amazing.\n\n44:22.280 --> 44:23.760\nAlso, she, you know,\n\n44:23.760 --> 44:24.760\ntalk about being intimidating.\n\n44:24.760 --> 44:26.480\nLike, she's, she's a,\n\n44:26.480 --> 44:27.920\nshe's never lost a fight.\n\n44:29.840 --> 44:31.720\nI've never lost a fight.\n\n44:31.720 --> 44:32.560\nYeah.\n\n44:32.560 --> 44:33.760\nHave you ever fought Layla Ali?\n\n44:33.760 --> 44:34.960\nI've never fought anyone.\n\n44:34.960 --> 44:35.800\nBut I've-\n\n44:35.800 --> 44:37.800\nHave you ever thrown a punch in anger at somebody?\n\n44:37.800 --> 44:38.640\nHave you ever actually like,\n\n44:38.640 --> 44:41.080\nlike vexed her on a duke at someone?\n\n44:41.080 --> 44:44.360\nI can't, I don't think I can tell some of these stories.\n\n44:44.360 --> 44:45.200\nWith your wife?\n\n44:45.200 --> 44:46.040\nYes.\n\n44:46.040 --> 44:46.880\nIt was your wife.\n\n44:46.880 --> 44:47.720\nBut.\n\n44:47.720 --> 44:48.560\nOh my God.\n\n44:48.560 --> 44:49.800\nIn my defense, you know,\n\n44:49.800 --> 44:50.960\nthey were children.\n\n44:50.960 --> 44:52.280\nNo.\n\n44:52.280 --> 44:53.480\nAnd they were welding.\n\n44:53.480 --> 44:54.960\nI've come, more recently,\n\n44:54.960 --> 44:56.000\nI've come close, you know,\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:58.920\nlike I do lose some sanity in those moments.\n\n44:58.920 --> 45:00.680\nI just feel like I don't care.\n\n45:00.680 --> 45:01.640\nI just remembered,\n\n45:01.640 --> 45:03.080\nand now let's bring Erin out.\n\n45:03.080 --> 45:05.160\nI punched her in the jaw in my sleep.\n\n45:05.160 --> 45:06.000\nAll right, Erin, come out.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:06.840\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n45:06.840 --> 45:09.560\nThank God for saying in your sleep at the end of that.\n\n45:09.560 --> 45:10.400\nYeah.\n\n45:10.400 --> 45:11.240\nI thought you were gonna say,\n\n45:11.240 --> 45:12.800\nI punched her in the jaw last Tuesday.\n\n45:12.800 --> 45:16.800\nYou know, I physically assaulted Erin in bed.\n\n45:16.800 --> 45:17.640\nYeah.\n\n45:17.640 --> 45:20.960\nI was having, we just watched Demolition Man.\n\n45:20.960 --> 45:24.440\nAnd I fell asleep and in my dream,\n\n45:24.440 --> 45:27.880\nI was fighting Sylvester Stallone in a ring.\n\n45:27.880 --> 45:30.680\nLike I was boxing him and he kept punching me.\n\n45:30.680 --> 45:32.720\nAnd I got, I was getting so frustrated.\n\n45:32.720 --> 45:34.040\nBecause your arms aren't moving.\n\n45:34.040 --> 45:36.880\nRight, you know, and then I finally like,\n\n45:36.880 --> 45:41.880\nand I woke up and something was weird in the bed.\n\n45:42.320 --> 45:46.320\nLike I had moved and my fiance is in bed next to me going,\n\n45:46.320 --> 45:50.120\now, a massaging her jaw.\n\n45:50.120 --> 45:54.120\nAnd I'm going, I slowly, I punched, I've done it.\n\n45:54.120 --> 45:57.760\nI mean, I have, and my excuse really was it's a lame,\n\n45:57.760 --> 46:00.040\nbut I, you know, my wife said you punched her.\n\n46:00.040 --> 46:02.440\nWell, next one, you and I were together a year ago.\n\n46:02.440 --> 46:07.440\nNo, no, he almost never punches, no, but I, she, I said,\n\n46:07.960 --> 46:09.440\nshe said, what's the matter with you?\n\n46:09.440 --> 46:10.280\nYou just punched me and woke me up.\n\n46:10.280 --> 46:12.320\nI said, well, I was defending you.\n\n46:12.320 --> 46:13.960\nWhich I really thought at the time,\n\n46:13.960 --> 46:16.560\nbecause that was what was happening in the dream, but.\n\n46:16.560 --> 46:17.400\nYeah.\n\n46:17.400 --> 46:19.960\nSo I mean, Dan, we've talked about this on the show before.\n\n46:19.960 --> 46:24.800\nDan really is very, he's so verbose in his sleep\n\n46:24.800 --> 46:25.800\nin a weird way.\n\n46:25.800 --> 46:28.800\nAnd I like a haunting way because it's not.\n\n46:28.800 --> 46:29.640\nIt's riveting.\n\n46:29.640 --> 46:32.920\nI imagine most people when they speak in their sleep\n\n46:32.920 --> 46:35.520\nsound kind of drunk or disoriented,\n\n46:35.520 --> 46:38.560\nbut Dan speaks very clearly and very like frightening,\n\n46:38.560 --> 46:41.440\nweird, non-secular, non-sequiturs.\n\n46:41.440 --> 46:43.280\nAlso, non-secular though.\n\n46:43.280 --> 46:44.120\nNon-secular.\n\n46:44.120 --> 46:46.240\nI get down to mythological.\n\n46:46.240 --> 46:47.240\nThere is no God.\n\n46:47.240 --> 46:49.240\nGod, walk down from, yeah.\n\n46:50.240 --> 46:52.160\nI actually think it's the best part of the documentary\n\n46:52.160 --> 46:53.520\nI saw in early cut.\n\n46:53.520 --> 46:56.320\nSo the, and that stuff of you asleep,\n\n46:56.320 --> 46:59.880\nWhat if you spoke in your sleep, but I was all a gospel.\n\n46:59.880 --> 47:02.640\nYeah, Dan speaks in his sleep a lot.\n\n47:02.640 --> 47:06.000\nAnd we actually, the other night when I was watching\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.840\nwhen Dan falls asleep, I'll watch a shitty movie\n\n47:08.840 --> 47:09.680\nfor a comfort.\n\n47:09.680 --> 47:11.200\nAnd Dan, well, we've talked about this before.\n\n47:11.200 --> 47:12.920\nThis is after you've watched Demolition Man.\n\n47:12.920 --> 47:13.760\nThen you'll watch it.\n\n47:13.760 --> 47:14.760\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n47:14.760 --> 47:16.600\nThen I'll go lowbrow.\n\n47:16.600 --> 47:17.440\nGot it.\n\n47:17.440 --> 47:18.280\nYeah, yeah.\n\n47:18.280 --> 47:20.280\nThere's Dan's version of a shitty movie.\n\n47:20.280 --> 47:22.840\nAnd there's my version of a comforting movie\n\n47:22.840 --> 47:24.400\nthat I've never seen before.\n\n47:24.400 --> 47:26.440\nThere's my version of a comforting movie,\n\n47:26.440 --> 47:29.720\nlike my best friend's wedding or et cetera, et cetera.\n\n47:29.720 --> 47:31.320\nAnd Dan will wake up in the middle of his sleep\n\n47:31.320 --> 47:34.720\nand say, well, I mean, if you're not in love,\n\n47:34.720 --> 47:37.000\nI mean, why don't you just fuck everybody at the wet\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:38.400\nand just fall back asleep?\n\n47:38.400 --> 47:43.400\nAnd I feel all the shame because it doesn't feel like\n\n47:44.120 --> 47:44.960\nit's talking in its sleep.\n\n47:44.960 --> 47:47.360\nShe actually, you, like this is not a real,\n\n47:47.360 --> 47:49.520\nlike you a couple of nights ago.\n\n47:49.520 --> 47:51.720\nIt's a one sided thing because you don't remember any of it.\n\n47:51.720 --> 47:52.880\nYou got up and left the bedroom\n\n47:52.880 --> 47:55.880\nbecause I was about to fall asleep and you,\n\n47:55.880 --> 47:58.160\nthis is a milestone in our relationship.\n\n47:58.160 --> 48:00.920\nYou left the bedroom to go finish watching\n\n48:00.920 --> 48:03.120\na romantic comedy in a different room\n\n48:03.120 --> 48:07.400\nbecause you knew, air quotes, knew\n\n48:07.400 --> 48:10.000\nthat if you continued watching it in bed,\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:11.960\nI would have notes in my sleep.\n\n48:11.960 --> 48:12.800\nYeah.\n\n48:12.800 --> 48:13.640\nAnd I wasn't mad.\n\n48:13.640 --> 48:16.680\nI kissed you and patted

--> 48:44.760\nthat Cheetos are bad for you.\n\n48:44.760 --> 48:45.600\nYes, I know.\n\n48:45.600 --> 48:46.440\nI know.\n\n48:46.440 --> 48:47.280\nBut I'm sleeping.\n\n48:47.280 -->

woman,\n\n49:16.080 --> 49:19.160\nlike it's really like sexist and crazy.\n\n49:19.160 --> 49:21.880\nBut like, just the way,\n\n49:21.880 --> 49:23.760\nthe truth is that I like,\n\n49:23.760 -->

great actor.\n\n51:05.440 --> 51:08.960\nSo it's funny watching him in these really shitty movies.\n\n51:08.960 --> 51:10.720\nSo anyway, so, so you will see-\n\n51:10.720 --> 51:13.640\nThen watch

51:23.080\nand criticized the movie, and I was like, you know what?\n\n51:23.080 --> 51:25.200\nI'm gonna, I'm gonna go to the other room\n\n51:25.200 --> 51:26.880\nbecause I know this is wrong.\n\n51:26.880 --> 51:28.360\nIt's like I was doing crack and bedding.\n\n51:28.360 --> 51:30.360\nI was like, don't do a crack and bed, yes I know, yes.\n\n51:30.360 --> 51:32.480\nI'll do it in the other room.\n\n51:32.480 --> 51:33.560\nSo I kissed him, goodbye.\n\n51:33.560 --> 51:35.080\nThat movie's a piece of shit.\n\n51:36.920 --> 51:39.360\nI fell asleep at the point where that movie\n\n51:39.360 --> 51:44.360\nspent 10 minutes depicting, in real time,\n\n51:44.440 --> 51:46.880\nKate Hudson learning to play a card game.\n\n51:48.280 --> 51:51.840\nYeah, she spends 10, 10 minutes of that movie.\n\n51:51.840 --> 51:53.080\nWhat game?\n\n51:53.080 --> 51:54.080\nIt's called Bullshit.\n\n51:54.080 --> 51:55.240\nIt's really charming.\n\n51:55.240 --> 51:57.600\nIt's kind of like in Goodwill Hunting when they just\n\n51:57.600 --> 52:00.760\ntake eight minutes to just tell you a street joke.\n\n52:00.760 --> 52:01.760\nIt's just a story point.\n\n52:01.760 --> 52:02.600\nIt's not a good movie.\n\n52:02.600 --> 52:03.760\nOh, mini driver, tell us a joke.\n\n52:03.760 --> 52:05.120\nOkay, I'm gonna tell you this joke.\n\n52:05.120 --> 52:06.960\nAll right, once upon a time.\n\n52:06.960 --> 52:11.160\nAnd there's no, this is a medium that invented the montage.\n\n52:11.160 --> 52:13.160\nFucking move past it.\n\n52:13.160 --> 52:15.520\nShow a calendar page going like this.\n\n52:15.520 --> 52:20.120\nCome back and say, oh, mini driver, what a great joke.\n\n52:20.120 --> 52:22.760\nThe Lumiere Brothers knew to do that.\n\n52:24.240 --> 52:26.360\nYou fucking forgot it now?\n\n52:26.360 --> 52:27.520\nNow?\n\n52:27.520 --> 52:29.960\nMy life is trickling away.\n\n52:31.160 --> 52:35.520\nSo does two pair, does that beat a full house?\n\n52:35.520 --> 52:36.360\nShe's just us.\n\n52:36.360 --> 52:37.280\nGo back to the start.\n\n52:37.280 --> 52:38.680\nWow, the game of bullshit.\n\n52:38.680 --> 52:41.480\nYou gotta call bullshit when you call bullshit.\n\n52:41.480 --> 52:43.520\nNo, okay, bullshit.\n\n52:43.520 --> 52:45.760\nYou're supposed to be so delighted by the whole thing.\n\n52:45.760 --> 52:46.600\nAnd I just want to.\n\n52:46.600 --> 52:47.440\nIt must have been notes.\n\n52:47.440 --> 52:49.360\nMatt's mom has a voice, it's like a heart.\n\n52:49.360 --> 52:52.040\nOh no, his voice is like a guy who's trying not to project.\n\n52:52.040 --> 52:53.080\nHe's just doing that.\n\n52:53.080 --> 52:54.480\nHe's just doing that movie.\n\n52:54.480 --> 52:56.080\nNo, that voice reaches me.\n\n52:56.080 --> 52:57.920\nHe's trying to be, he's trying to be.\n\n52:57.920 --> 53:01.600\nAll right, all right, all right, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n53:01.600 --> 53:03.680\nIf you don't exhale as you talk,\n\n53:03.680 --> 53:06.480\nanybody can sound like Matthew McConaughey.\n\n53:06.480 --> 53:10.280\nIt's just, it's nothing, it's nothing.\n\n53:10.280 --> 53:13.560\nHis voice is like always covered in icing.\n\n53:13.560 --> 53:15.320\nIt's like a Christian Slater started his career\n\n53:15.320 --> 53:17.440\ntrying to sound like Nicholson, which is true by the way.\n\n53:17.440 --> 53:21.040\nWhich is true because my friend Jimmy knows his mother.\n\n53:21.040 --> 53:22.960\nOr a night Christian Slater.\n\n53:22.960 --> 53:24.280\nYeah, exactly.\n\n53:24.280 --> 53:27.120\nYou named my other voice crush, pump up the volume,\n\n53:27.120 --> 53:28.480\nlike Christian Slater.\n\n53:28.480 --> 53:29.320\nYeah, yeah, but also.\n\n53:29.320 --> 53:31.240\nYou know, there's just copies of other guys\n\n53:31.240 --> 53:34.320\nbecause Matthew McConaughey is doing Paul Newman.\n\n53:34.320 --> 53:37.280\nSure, well, I don't know, really?\n\n53:37.280 --> 53:38.840\nYeah, oh, definitely.\n\n53:38.840 --> 53:40.680\nBut still that doesn't, I mean,\n\n53:40.680 --> 53:43.040\nI still appreciate Christian Slater's voice.\n\n53:43.040 --> 53:44.960\nI think Paul Newman's a million times cooler\n\n53:44.960 --> 53:46.040\nand sexier than Christian Slater.\n\n53:46.040 --> 53:47.600\nI mean, not now, but yeah, right.\n\n53:47.600 --> 53:52.160\nI like when Kurt Russell and Big Trouble\n\n53:52.160 --> 53:54.080\nand Little China is doing John Wayne,\n\n53:54.080 --> 53:55.760\nand that's great because he's just really,\n\n53:55.760 --> 53:57.560\nhe just picks one movie to be John Wayne\n\n53:57.560 --> 53:59.000\nand then that's hilarious.\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:00.760\nAlso that movie, that holds up.\n\n54:00.760 --> 54:02.320\nYeah, it does hold up.\n\n54:02.320 --> 54:03.160\nBig Trouble, Little China.\n\n54:03.160 --> 54:06.160\nMay I make a little announcement really quick?\n\n54:06.160 --> 54:07.000\nUh-oh.\n\n54:07.000 -->

compliment,\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:23.960\nbut when I woke up from the love of my life\n\n57:23.960 --> 57:25.520\npunching me in the mouth,\n\n57:25.520 --> 57:27.920\nI was like, we'll talk about it in the morning\n\n57:27.920 --> 57:29.200\nand just put a pillow between us.\n\n57:29.200 --> 57:30.280\nI went back to sleep.\n\n57:30.280 --> 57:34.520\nYou are the second woman in 41 years\n\n57:34.520 --> 57:37.560\nthat I have physically assaulted in my sleep.\n\n57:38.440 --> 57:39.280\nAw.\n\n57:39.280 --> 57:40.120\nAw.\n\n57:40.120 --> 57:40.960\nAw.\n\n57:40.960 -->

57:46.840\nThat was a third time,\n\n57:46.840 --> 57:50.280\nThat was a third time I've been assaulted by that dance.\n\n57:50.280 --> 57:52.400\nMy girlfriend, Alison,\n\n57:53.320 --> 57:54.480\nin my 20s,\n\n57:54.480 --> 57:57.000\nwe went to visit my parents in Florida.\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:58.440\nWait, Alison with the flat nose?\n\n57:58.440 --> 57:59.280\nAlison with that bro.\n\n57:59.280 --> 58:00.120\nYeah.\n\n58:00.120 --> 58:01.960\nShe dated, she dated Elvis Gustav.\n\n58:01.960 --> 58:04.400\nShe's sleeping in our parents' guest room\n\n58:04.400 --> 58:05.800\nand I,\n\n58:05.800 --> 58:10.160\nat the time I was reading a lot of alien abduction books\n\n58:10.160 --> 58:12.560\nbecause I was writing a script\n\n58:13.600 --> 58:15.840\nthat was going to be an alien abduction comedy\n\n58:15.840 --> 58:20.440\nthat I hoped that perhaps Mr. Sandler might read.\n\n58:20.440 --> 58:23.120\nWho knows?\n\n58:23.120 --> 58:26.080\nCan I James as lead alien?\n\n58:26.080 --> 58:26.920\nBut I was,\n\n58:26.920 --> 58:31.560\nand I was half asleep and you're in that weird fugue state\n\n58:31.560 --> 58:32.720\nwhere you think you're awake,\n\n58:32.720 --> 58:35.000\nbut you're asleep or whatever.\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:38.320\nI rolled over and like,\n\n58:38.320 --> 58:42.000\nI realized that I was in bed with a gray.\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:44.120\nThere was an alien face.\n\n58:44.120 --> 58:44.960\nYeah.\n\n58:44.960 --> 58:48.840\nLike Whitley Stryber alien face staring at me\n\n58:48.840 --> 58:50.440\non the pillow next to me and I went,\n\n58:50.440 --> 58:51.280\nAh!\n\n58:51.280 --> 58:53.480\nAnd I flailed physically.\n\n58:53.480 --> 58:55.480\nI was like, get this alien away from me.\n\n58:55.480 --> 58:57.160\nThe way you would with an alien.\n\n58:57.160 --> 58:58.480\nThere's an alien laying in bed.\n\n58:58.480 --> 59:00.160\nYou know who else has had that experience?\n\n59:00.160 --> 59:02.880\nEveryone who's ever thought they saw an alien.\n\n59:02.880 --> 59:03.720\nBy the way.\n\n59:03.720 --> 59:05.560\nAnd you know what I mean?\n\n59:05.560 --> 59:06.400\nBut anyway, quite.\n\n59:06.400 --> 59:09.240\nAnd it flailed and in flailing,\n\n59:09.240 --> 59:11.120\nmy knuckles like hit,\n\n59:11.120 --> 59:16.120\nI mean, I hit my lover and the face getting\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:19.440\nthis alien away from me and then came to\n\n59:19.440 --> 59:21.440\nand my poor girlfriend is going,\n\n59:21.440 --> 59:24.440\nyou, excuse me, that's not part of the story.\n\n59:24.440 --> 59:28.920\nI've never seen anyone sneeze on stage.\n\n59:28.920 --> 59:31.000\nIt's actually impossible.\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:31.840\nI'm that comfortable.\n\n59:31.840 --> 59:34.520\nI didn't know if it was possible to sneeze on stage.\n\n59:34.520 --> 59:35.680\nI don't think, I never thought it was.\n\n59:35.680 --> 59:36.520\nIt was weird, isn't it?\n\n59:36.520 --> 59:38.400\nI must be allergic to entertainment.\n\n59:38.400 --> 59:41.800\nI've had that theory a long time,\n\n59:41.800 --> 59:42.640\nbut now it's finally proven.\n\n59:42.640 --> 59:43.880\nBut you know, what was your name?\n\n59:43.880 --> 59:45.200\nAlisa?\n\n59:45.200 --> 59:46.040\nAllison.\n\n59:46.040 --> 59:46.880\nAllison.\n\n59:46.880 --> 59:48.720\nAllison.\n\n59:48.720 --> 59:51.480\nShe had a tattoo of a son in the middle of her back\n\n59:51.480 --> 59:54.680\nand a half made mermaid tattoo in the inside of her thigh.\n\n59:54.680 --> 59:56.640\nNo, you're merging, you're merging two women.\n\n01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.920\nAllison had a sudden, sudden tattoo on her back.\n\n01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.480\nYou're thinking of a different person\n\n01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.000\nwith the mermaid tattoo.\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.240\nGreat.\n\n01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:09.840\nWho was that person?\n\n01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.040\nNow I know there's another person.\n\n01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.160\nI thought it was the same person.\n\n01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:17.120\nI assume that son tattoo would also have mermaid thigh tattoo.\n\n01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.520\nThat's what you don't understand about women.\n\n01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:23.160\nNo woman would have both of those things.\n\n01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.640\nSon tattoo on the back girl has Japanese congee\n\n01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:29.440\nthat says strength on her ankle.\n\n01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.360\nI think we've all known that.\n\n01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.120\nIt was a different time.\n\n01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.400\nAnd it was her own fault for probing you, right?\n\n01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.680\nI mean, that might have been part of it.\n\n01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:36.840\nMaybe she wasn't alien.\n\n01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.080\nI don't know, maybe it's our true form.\n\n01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.480\nBut I, and then, and then, and so there's,\n\n01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.480\nthat's the second time that I've actually\n\n01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.240\nhurt someone that I was in bed with.\n\n01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.680\nSo you woke up and your fists made contact.\n\n01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.440\nRight.\n\n01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.360\nThank you.\n\n01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.160\nMatthew McConaughey reference.\n\n01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.600\nHe was in the movie Contact.\n\n01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.760\nBut I've told the story before.\n\n01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.320\nShow's over.\n\n01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:00.960\nEverybody out.\n\n01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:04.680\nI had a dream once where Bruce Willis was taunting me\n\n01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.960\nand I was fighting Bruce Willis.\n\n01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:12.120\nAnd I was thankfully, thank God, I was alone at the time,\n\n01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:15.760\nsleeping in a single mattress in my two bedroom apartment.\n\n01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.600\nAnd in my dream, Bruce Willis was taunting me.\n\n01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.960\nAnd I, again, with the thing where you're like,\n\n01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.000\nI can't move my arms.\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.160\nAnd then you just go, I don't fuck you, Bruce Willis.\n\n01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.840\nIf it was witty taunting, that's how you can tell.\n\n01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.880\nHe was just smirking.\n\n01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.840\nHe was smirking.\n\n01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:32.480\nYeah, no.\n\n01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.840\nLike Capri or Seagram's golden wine coolers smirk.\n\n01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.680\nAnd I just lunged at him and woke up\n\n01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.040\nas my fist collided with the plaster wall next to my bed.\n\n01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.040\nOh, no.\n\n01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.760\nLike really hard.\n\n01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:51.480\nAnd the thing that always blows me away about that\n\n01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.360\nis the idea that some way of looking at the universe\n\n01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.040\nare unconscious dream characters.\n\n01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.280\nThey have a life of their own.\n\n01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.480\nThey exist because we make them exist.\n\n01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:06.880\nAnd they're accountable to our wakefulness or sleepfulness.\n\n01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.320\nThey resent us for being gods that they can't control.\n\n01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.000\nThey know that they're going to all die no matter what\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.720\nas soon as we wake up, which Bruce does not.\n\n01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.000\nAnd one guy in the figment of my unconscious mind,\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.600\none hero, this Bruce Willis guy, in one dream,\n\n01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:25.640\nknowing that he was going to die along with the rest\n\n01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:29.560\nof Dreamworld, like he accomplished this Promethean task.\n\n01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.920\nLike he bruised my knuckles.\n\n01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.280\nLike he reached out across the threshold\n\n01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:39.720\nbetween sleep and awake and fucked with me.\n\n01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.920\nAnd won a fight with you.\n\n01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.480\nLike there would be a statue of him built outside of Dream City\n\n01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:49.040\nif those fucking assholes could live past it today.\n\n01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:49.440\nYeah, right.\n\n01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.760\nHe hurt someone.\n\n01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.800\nHe hurt one of the real people.\n\n01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.560\nHe'd be the president of Dreams.\n\n01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.800\nWell, fuck Dream City because in Dream City,\n\n01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.080\nthey administered that fucking I can't run or walk\n\n01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.040\nand the gun doesn't shoot.\n\n01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.560\nNothing fucking works drug on you.\n\n01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:06.800\nAnd so they always win this fucking Dream City motherfucker.\n\n01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:07.600\nFuck those girls.\n\n01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.240\nIs this a real thing or is this a movie?\n\n01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.480\nSweetie.\n\n01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.560\nDid I tell you about the dream when I was JJ from Good Times\n\n01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:19.320\nand I was fucking Thelma the whole time?\n\n01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.760\nYou get that in every show.\n\n01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.520\nUnbelievable.\n\n01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.000\nNever.\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.280\nIt's like it's an unmistakable agenda.\n\n01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.240\nOK, so amazing.\n\n01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:32.600\nBruce Willis, not the sharpest dude apparently.\n\n01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.000\nDid you read Kevin Smith's book?\n\n01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:34.520\nNo.\n\n01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.280\nOh, it's amazing.\n\n01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.640\nKevin Smith talks shit about him?\n\n01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.000\nOh, my god, yeah.\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.720\nAnd every other sentence keeps saying like,\n\n01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.120\nI mean, he's a hero of mine.\n\n01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.600\nAnd what a fucking asshole.\n\n01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.640\nAnd I actually was at a party with him once.\n\n01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.840\nAnd I had like this.\n\n01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.240\nYou were at a party with Bruce Willis?\n\n01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.520\nYeah, I was.\n\n01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.320\nMy friend Kevin Rooney knows all these guys\n\n01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.920\nbecause he was a comic, you know?\n\n01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.520\nBruce Willis.\n\n01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.120\nWillis, yeah.\n\n01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.880\nSo that whole class of comics knows him.\n\n01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:59.160\nAnd he walked up and my friend Kevin was holding a.\n\n01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.120\nThat whole class of comics.\n\n01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.520\nIt sure is like one year, you know?\n\n01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.840\nThere's also a jazz musician somewhere saying like, well,\n\n01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.360\nyou know, Bruce was a jazz musician.\n\n01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:11.000\nWell, that's his real gift.\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.440\nBut he walked up to my friend who was holding a cookie\n\n01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.640\nand he wanted to make a joke.\n\n01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.640\nAnd the joke he came up with is, what do you got there?\n\n01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.120\nA donut?\n\n01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:25.280\nAnd

01:04:35.600\nAnd this is a, isn't that a crazy story?\n\n01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.400\nI saw Bruce Willis at a bar one time.\n\n01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.160\nLike when I was like 24 and I was dating\n\n01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:44.200\na girl who looked enough like Demi Moore to you can say,\n\n01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:47.280\nBruce Willis might have a Demi Moore type of type.\n\n01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.440\nShe had like the kind of like just above the shoulder\n\n01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:54.360\nblack bobbed hair like a similar size didn't look facially like her but I was\n\n01:04:54.360

Widmark I think at that\n\n01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:54.520\nstage of his career there was no a list people doing his work no no he was\n\n01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:58.400\ngoing back to the Widmarks people those are people who were selling you their\n\n01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:03.560\nCD outside 7-eleven it was just with the incense it's it's a shame to see a star\n\n01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:12.360\nfalling McClintock yeah I'm a Clint the writer of the spooky bridge my friend\n\n01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:18.680\nJim went to meet with Jerry Lewis wants to talk about making the nutty\n\n01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:24.080\nprofessor into a musical and one of the things that Jerry Lewis kept saying is\n\n01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:30.200\nI've got a prop guy he's the best and I think of that when we talk about\n\n01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:35.120\nMcClintock this guy I'll call this prop guy when we're ready he's the best you\n\n01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:42.480\nhaven't seen a umbrella this guy has an umbrella we're gonna do a Broadway play the day the clown\n\n01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:47.360\ncried the big thick screenplay that I've never seen the screen in the screenplay\n\n01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:51.960\nthat Jerry Lewis wrote that says about the shoes and there's an annotation that\n\n01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:57.640\nsays we need to discuss the shoes with props or something like that that's when\n\n01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:05.880\nhe found this new prop guy yeah you guys ever take a clown class I'm willing to\n\n01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:10.320\nshow us I take us through it right that sounded like I was about to teach you a\n\n01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.760\nclown idea I thought I was sure that's what was coming next this certainly\n\n01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:17.840\nsounds like we're in for a clown class yeah yeah we'd love to take a clown class\n\n01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:24.760\nabsolutely I asked a question because I think most people my age that were\n\n01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:28.680\ntheater majors you have to take a clown class and you have to reduce your\n\n01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:35.960\npersonality to one emotion and that is your clown dingleberry what was your\n\n01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:42.280\nemotion about to yawn or something that's you know be mused resignation just\n\n01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:54.640\nan about to yawn clown at all times that face you make right before those starts\n\n01:23:54.640 --> 01:24:01.400\nto flare nobody gets this what I've been doing this I traveled with this one\n\n01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:06.200\none clown competition I don't think this is totally representative of me but\n\n01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:13.120\nwhen I was 17 my my clown was like a really careless clumsy clown whereas\n\n01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:20.000\nnow had you come up with that it was given to you yeah it's just it's a\n\n01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.560\npretty standard clown I mean they're not great with their hands Mitch Mitch if\n\n01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:28.080\nyou had to be if you're in a clown class and you had to like very quickly choose\n\n01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:33.200\nyour as your essential clown quality your essential car if it wasn't about to\n\n01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:40.480\nyawn yeah sleepy sleepy sleepy yeah I think that a professor or actually Lucy\n\n01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:46.440\ntoo hot would be a good clown just constantly like wedding sweater it's\n\n01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:51.640\ntoo hot when you talk as a con is that an option you cannot talk as a club for\n\n01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:56.120\nyour final you cannot talk makes that makes it's too hot so let's get that\n\n01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:00.600\none word they can go maybe they can do that right oh no really the Circus\n\n01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:07.960\nLane and you said to show the guy cuz I think I would do rethinking\n\n01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:13.280\nChristianity like it would be like a clown a clown that was raised Lutheran\n\n01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:19.920\nsay and Catholic yeah you know and maybe it's like half the genuflection and he\n\n01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:26.880\njust stares off big eyebrows all right so it's it's that at that point in the\n\n01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:31.520\nshow we're usually for the last eight years or so we would usually bring out\n\n01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:43.720\nSpencer it's not here he's got the week off that's right well he was a Dan\n\n01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:49.280\npunched him in his sleep you know Spencer was watching watching like\n\n01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:55.520\nwhatever chocolate and Dan we had a guy stabbed him with a butter knife we had a\n\n01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:59.360\nconversation about it and it turns out hindsight being 2020 Spencer's the only\n\n01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:04.560\none who was never told unlike all of us that he didn't have to do the show if\n\n01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:09.760\nhe didn't want to well who told him that why was he no one ever told him\n\n01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.440\nanything he just like kind of fell into this this thing and he you know he was\n\n01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:17.440\ndoing this thing and he felt like he had to do it or else there would be\n\n01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:21.120\nhorrible repercussions they didn't do it and he wasn't having a good time doing\n\n01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:26.120\nit all the time and he felt forced to do it and we haven't really been up to\n\n01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:33.000\nspending not that there is any like expectations that he puts on us but we\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:39.360\nif there were an expectation we were underneath that expectation as D&D\n\n01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:46.040\ncampaigners where we don't yeah certainly by Gen Con tournament rules we\n\n01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:50.400\nremember what happens we play too short us around we we all have an inventory\n\n01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:55.320\nfull of awesome shit that we've never used so we're to believe the word to\n\n01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:58.800\nbelieve that there's something that he'd rather be doing than playing Dungeons\n\n01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:04.960\nand Dragons on a Sunday night for free I misjudged this could we we should have\n\n01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:09.920\nhim tailed and see where he's at the batting cages right now he's playing\n\n01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:15.960\nmagic together he doesn't want to do it or anything he does he absolutely does\n\n01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:20.360\nhe loves doing it I think that but I would I was abhorred to find out more\n\n01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:24.080\nto find to find out that he and I never really thought about it that he felt like\n\n01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:27.400\nhe had to do it that would I would never want anyone feeling like they had to do\n\n01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:32.440\nsomething like Kumail texts me when we never had a single conversation about it\n\n01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:38.840\nKumail texts me every week that says either I got a I got an early call\n\n01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:42.880\ntime tomorrow or I'll see you tonight it doesn't matter Jeff always has a reason\n\n01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:47.560\nto if he's not going to be here it's because he's got some gig and so we\n\n01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:52.200\ntry to replace him if we didn't the roof wouldn't necessarily cave in we haven't\n\n01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:57.920\nhad not had a comptroller yet but Aaron comes and goes dispenser was brought up\n\n01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:04.200\nout of the odd indispensable and and never like like you put yourself in his\n\n01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:07.080\nshoes and you think like he never actually had an opportunity to know\n\n01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.480\nwhether or not he what what if you were what if he were to come up in the\n\n01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:15.960\ngreen room and go yeah yeah I don't want to play D&T this week I think I would\n\n01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:20.680\nlike to go what would you like to play we can play something else so that was\n\n01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:24.520\nthat moment in last week's show I think where he said like what why would my why\n\n01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:27.040\ndid you guys bring me up as we keep bringing him up and not talking to him\n\n01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:31.880\nfor like like a 10 or 15 or sometimes 20 minute span and you know it's like he\n\n01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:36.240\nhas every right to like to cater the show to whatever he wants to get out of it\n\n01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:39.880\nyou know yeah yeah I don't think there's there's it never be a single person up\n\n01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:44.120\nhere who's who's who's bummed out to be up I'm a little sad right now that he's\n\n01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.280\nnot here only because I love spence well now it's withdrawal it's like there's a\n\n01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:53.440\nlittle table and it's like that we have to we have to on the fly we have to come\n\n01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:58.600\nup with it because we've also our show is dependent on Spencer as a closer so\n\n01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:02.600\nwe're just as guilty as anybody of like I have a I've got a feeling there's gonna\n\n01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:08.320\nbe some rapid hey let's call them why don't we call them but call them we'll\n\n01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:12.560\nput them on speakerphone say we and what you have to be really quiet and we'll\n\n01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:17.680\nsay hey man we just ended the show early and we just thought we missed you we\n\n01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:22.880\nthought maybe you and I could just play some D&D my feeling was Aaron's here I'm\n\n01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:29.880\njust coming up with this now we bring up someone from the audience we that needs\n\n01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:36.560\na problem resolved I'll sit at Spencer's table and I'll I wouldn't call it\n\n01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:42.920\ndungeon mastering because there's no dungeon involved but we'll walk through\n\n01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:47.400\nhelping them solve their problem okay and I can I also can I add a pitch to\n\n01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:51.320\nthat sure maybe you can replace that pitch okay I mean I don't know how\n\n01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:54.200\neasy it is to be we won't have the character sheets but we can remember\n\n01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:56.960\nenough because we don't really know our character sheets all that well anyway\n\n01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:02.560\nthat you go over there sit down I play the Spencer D&D intro music and you ice\n\n01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:08.280\ntea dungeon master a little campaign here you can make up all the make sense\n\n01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:12.040\nthey give me new characters we can pick a new character be a dream sequence yeah\n\n01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:15.520\nI would say you could try your hand at that at ice tea dungeon master was that\n\n01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:19.080\ntoo heavy an impression also gives it gives you the advantage that next time\n\n01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:22.240\nyou talk to Spencer you can say don't worry about it it went better than it's\n\n01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:28.080\never been you know and then and then maybe Spencer I don't want to make a I\n\n01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:32.080\ndon't want to make a mockery of his no I see I don't want to like use your\n\n01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.720\ncharacters because we don't have the character sheets and all it's not yeah\n\n01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:37.720\nso we can make up new characters we could do it right I mean we so I think the\n\n01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:41.680\nthing would be a shallow mockery of what Spencer does very well right first\n\n01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:45.800\nstep is who who who in the audience somebody's already raising their hand\n\n01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:53.760\nwho's this young man Eric do you want to come up here I was gonna ask who has\n\n01:30:53.760 --> 01:31:00.560\nherpes Eric you can sit there yeah great no also

01:31:54.400\nof it's a little bit jaded there's a lot of stuff to do yeah it's a tough\n\n01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:59.600\nmarket man yeah when I was your age I'm judging from the lack of pores in your\n\n01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:04.160\nskin that you're about half my age I thought it worked on I I worked in\n\n01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:07.520\ncomic books yes you can only you know who would have
