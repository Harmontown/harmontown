Hello everybody, welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California!

00:24.720 --> 00:33.720
Harmontown is now in session. Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon!

00:43.720 --> 00:51.720
Thank you. Thank you for coming out. You're all wonderful. Let's figure everything out.

00:51.720 --> 00:57.720
How are you, Dan? I'm good. I just came from doing the treatment with Elvis Mitchell.

00:57.720 --> 01:10.720
Californians will know what I'm talking about, KCRW, Elvis Mitchell. Very wily and unexpectedly deep researcher in terms of his interviews.

01:10.720 --> 01:16.720
I don't know, I can't figure that guy out. He was asking me questions about comic books I wrote in the 90s.

01:16.720 --> 01:23.720
It was weird. Weird how? He did so much research?

01:23.720 --> 01:30.720
It was very insightful and asking strange questions that had never been asked.

01:30.720 --> 01:38.720
I had heard him interview people before. I was always fantasized about being a guest of his one day.

01:38.720 --> 01:44.720
Maybe I'll be a writer and I'll be interviewed by this guy who interviews writers.

01:44.720 --> 01:54.720
Somebody had told me, yeah, he draws weird parallels and connects weird dots that may or may not be there but you.

01:54.720 --> 02:04.720
Then he did. He was talking about how all of my work was about sensitivity, exposed nerves. That's what he kept saying.

02:04.720 --> 02:10.720
I kept saying it's about humanity versus systems. That's what I always thought.

02:10.720 --> 02:18.720
But he kept saying exposed nerves, which I guess, yeah, I don't know.

02:18.720 --> 02:24.720
I feel like you have exposed nerves. Well everyone does. What does that even mean? I don't know.

02:24.720 --> 02:29.720
It feels like I just hit one right now. What is that supposed to mean?

02:29.720 --> 02:37.720
It was odd and insightful. I was on fire. Do you think it's a catchphrase of his that he's applied to lots of people?

02:37.720 --> 02:41.720
No, God knows. Absolutely. He just gave you.

02:41.720 --> 02:47.720
I don't think he doesn't have catchphrases. He doesn't have catchalls that he uses with each individual guest.

02:47.720 --> 02:56.720
With each guest, the gimmick seems to be that all of a sudden he's asking a question that's sort of like, oh yeah, I guess.

02:56.720 --> 03:03.720
I guess so. I guess. I don't know how to explain it. Listen to it. I'm plugging it. I was happy with the interview.

03:03.720 --> 03:09.720
The other weird thing is it was at the house of the guy who created SpongeBob SquarePants.

03:09.720 --> 03:15.720
But he wasn't on the show. It was just at his house. Is it always at his house? No, it's not.

03:15.720 --> 03:20.720
Is he always host from a different... No, he just not always host from a house. And no, there's not...

03:20.720 --> 03:27.720
It was pulled up at a giant house, the kind of house you'd expect to have if you created SpongeBob SquarePants.

03:27.720 --> 03:35.720
A giant pineapple. Rolled in. And there were... There's just all these people. I guess they're KCRW donors.

03:35.720 --> 03:50.720
Kind of well-heeled, liberal types. Like kind of ersatz Tim Robbins' and eating prosciutto and things and drinking the lightful Campari drinks.

03:50.720 --> 03:59.720
They were low-budged Tim Robbins? Well, I wouldn't call them low-budged. Well, I'm saying non-Tim Robbins Tim Robbins.

03:59.720 --> 04:06.720
Handsome old men with gray feathered hair. But just not... They weren't in the hide-sucker proxy. Yeah, exactly.

04:06.720 --> 04:12.720
There were actors. I'm sure there were a lot of them were captains of industry or something. They were all patrons of public...

04:12.720 --> 04:18.720
All hanging out at the creator of SpongeBob's house? All at SpongeBob's house. Even though SpongeBob, who I talked to...

04:18.720 --> 04:24.720
I don't think he likes to be called SpongeBob. He was just like...

04:24.720 --> 04:30.720
Yeah, it's at my house, man. Good to have you here. He was there like...

04:30.720 --> 04:42.720
Yeah, but only because his wife was like... I think she's into... I think from talking to him when I gleaned is his wife is very active in that community.

04:42.720 --> 04:53.720
And so offered up their home as a venue. The high-falutin liberal writer type community or what community?

04:53.720 --> 05:00.720
Well, I don't know. These people were... I believe they were primarily donors. They were like people who really keep KCRW going.

05:00.720 --> 05:12.720
Yeah, I got you, yeah. So just a... Still the strangest... I said to Elvis Mitchell when I got there, well, I've listened to your show a bunch of times.

05:12.720 --> 05:20.720
I've heard you interview people. I've never... I didn't know that when I was listening to it, you were in a living room full of middle-aged...

05:20.720 --> 05:30.720
Timsters. I never picked up on that. He said, oh, no, we've never done this before. I was like, okay, all right, I'll see you on the ice.

05:30.720 --> 05:41.720
And we just sat in front of a fireplace surrounded by delightful primarily caucasoid...

05:41.720 --> 05:51.720
People kind of just sitting enthralled at every little word I had to say about how I was angry at executives and how humanity should fight the system.

05:51.720 --> 05:55.720
It was invigorating. Did you ever get like a back rub from anybody?

05:55.720 --> 06:02.720
There was a point where Elvis started rubbing me, but it was radio, so you won't be able to tell from listening.

06:02.720 --> 06:13.720
And I didn't feel like I was allowed to say no, which is fucked up. But I also don't feel like I'm allowed to say that.

06:13.720 --> 06:23.720
But also, you have a lot of exposed nerves. What do you mean? But it was nice. It was interesting.

06:23.720 --> 06:35.720
And I felt very articulate. I went up and I stumbled over my words very little. I felt like I was in a room full of my parents or something.

06:35.720 --> 06:39.720
And I had to rise to the level of my cardigan.

06:39.720 --> 06:47.720
I'm not saying this to be glib. Had you drunk less? Did you show up a little bit?

06:47.720 --> 06:53.720
No, I had like three of these wonderful drinks they made that were Kampare grapefruit drinks.

06:53.720 --> 06:58.720
I don't know if I was less drunk than I usually am at four in the afternoon.

06:58.720 --> 07:02.720
I'm asking, was it a gig? You go like, you know, I'm going to have a...

07:02.720 --> 07:10.720
No, I wasn't. If anything, I was a little panicked about how sober I was because I was like, I don't want my brain to get in the way of what's going on here.

07:10.720 --> 07:16.720
I've got a lot of weird class issues and stuff. Living room full of rich people listening to me.

07:16.720 --> 07:20.720
Do you make any friends outside of Elvis? I don't make...

07:20.720 --> 07:27.720
Friends, I don't know what that means. You be like, a snowman? Like you go in the front yard? How do you make a friend?

07:27.720 --> 07:31.720
You and these white people on the couch with the gray hair and the back ribs.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.720
Was there an after party? Did you guys...

07:34.720 --> 07:36.720
There was a mingling.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.720
In my mind, the sun goes down and you guys are in the tub.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.720
It gets back an alien.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.720
Hey guys, there's a room full of swim trunks. We've got all sizes. Whatever you want.

07:44.720 --> 07:50.720
But I was really taken and a little put off by how handsome everyone was.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.720
Because they're all over 50 and they all look under 30.

07:54.720 --> 07:59.720
And I'm 41 and I look 60. And I felt like that was okay.

07:59.720 --> 08:04.720
But the guy that created SpongeBob's got a 15-year-old kid and I won't drop his age.

08:04.720 --> 08:07.720
He told me how old he was and I was shocked.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.720
You know, it's weird when somebody tells you how old they are and you're...

08:10.720 --> 08:14.720
My response was like, holy shit! But I forgot to say,

08:14.720 --> 08:16.720
I'm saying that because you look young.

08:16.720 --> 08:19.720
So somebody goes like, I'm 52 and you go, wow!

08:19.720 --> 08:21.720
Fuck! Jesus Christ!

08:21.720 --> 08:22.720
Holy smoke!

08:22.720 --> 08:25.720
What's that like?

08:25.720 --> 08:30.720
But there's a... I mean, people that are...

08:30.720 --> 08:36.720
I don't know, they must eat algae and not drink and just walk in a treadmill and do crunches, fight crime.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.720
I don't know what they do.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.720
Your faces look like little kendals.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.720
We've both been to parties full of rich white people.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.720
People with lots of money tend to age well.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.720
They get really good health care and shit.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.720
Yeah, so the guy that created SpongeBob...

08:50.720 --> 08:53.720
They take a lot of vacations, they get some vitamin D and stuff like that.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.720
They know how to...

08:55.720 --> 08:57.720
And I wonder, does that mean they're going to live to 150?

08:57.720 --> 09:00.720
Or does that mean, as Erin said, no, they're going to die when you die,

09:00.720 --> 09:02.720
but they're going to do so gracefully.

09:02.720 --> 09:04.720
They'll probably die 20 years later too, by the way.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.720
But I mean, they'll have a better quality of life.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.720
He looks like Davey Jones.

09:09.720 --> 09:12.720
The guy that created SpongeBob, he is like...

09:12.720 --> 09:15.720
The number of his age is like, you're like,

09:15.720 --> 09:18.720
wow, you should have thrown in the towel biologically.

09:18.720 --> 09:23.720
It's a couple years older than me, but it's like, I associate it with like, fuck it.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.720
Like, you should be wearing Kleenex boxes on your feet,

09:26.720 --> 09:31.720
and you should be flipping off traffic and shooting your TV with a 38

09:31.720 --> 09:33.720
and fucking checking out, man.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.720
And he looks like Davey Jones.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.720
I did that show a long time ago.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.720
Yeah, and he looks great.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.720
It's amazing to me.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.720
I get a little jealous, I guess.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.720
I should eat some kale or something.

09:45.720 --> 09:51.720
I feel like the secret, for the wealthy people that I know that have awesome lives,

09:51.720 --> 09:54.720
they spend a lot of their time on vacation.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.720
There's lots of like, Riviera's and things.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.720
You're on a boat a lot.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.720
Here's somebody who's...

10:01.720 --> 10:04.720
To me, this is a truly remarkable...

10:04.720 --> 10:06.720
I wish there was a way we could...

10:06.720 --> 10:10.720
Somebody Wikipedia Stan Winston and tell me how old he is.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.720
Is that the special effects guy?

10:12.720 --> 10:13.720
Yeah.

10:13.720 --> 10:14.720
He was on a...

10:14.720 --> 10:17.720
We're watching the newest season of King of the Nerds.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.720
Remember when we had Genevieve Pearson on the show?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.720
She was a contestant on King of the Nerds.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.720
There's a new season of that.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.720
Stan Winston comes out with a robot he built or whatever.

10:26.720 --> 10:27.720
He looks like a fuck...

10:27.720 --> 10:29.720
He looks like Tony Hawk or something.

10:29.720 --> 10:34.720
I have been to his old house many times because Ryan Stiles from Hooseline bought his old house in L.A.

10:34.720 --> 10:35.720
I think he recently sold.

10:35.720 --> 10:39.720
And his house is up in this old house that he got rid of.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.720
You'd be young if you had this house.

10:41.720 --> 10:46.720
It's up in the valley side of the Hollywood Hills like towards Encino.

10:46.720 --> 10:51.720
There's a backyard that if you were the guy in the world that could throw a football the farthest,

10:51.720 --> 10:53.720
you couldn't throw a football out of that yard.

10:53.720 --> 11:00.720
And it was like the front of it looked like if Bilbo Baggins was as tall as Gandalf.

11:00.720 --> 11:05.720
It looked like a shire home except the person that lived there was 11 feet tall.

11:05.720 --> 11:09.720
We have shared units of measure like acres and yards.

11:09.720 --> 11:10.720
If you...

11:10.720 --> 11:12.720
You don't have to...

11:12.720 --> 11:13.720
Nobody knows...

11:13.720 --> 11:14.720
No, I see...

11:14.720 --> 11:15.720
Fuck you because...

11:15.720 --> 11:16.720
No, no, no.

11:16.720 --> 11:17.720
If I said...

11:17.720 --> 11:20.720
Dan, it was 14,000 square feet.

11:20.720 --> 11:21.720
You would go...

11:21.720 --> 11:22.720
You wouldn't know what I was talking about.

11:22.720 --> 11:23.720
You would say...

11:23.720 --> 11:24.720
You would say how many hobbits?

11:24.720 --> 11:25.720
How many Gandalfs?

11:25.720 --> 11:28.720
If I was a Gandalf, how many hobbits?

11:28.720 --> 11:29.720
How dare you?

11:29.720 --> 11:30.720
All right.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.720
You hit my exposed nerve, you son of a bitch.

11:32.720 --> 11:33.720
I really do.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.720
It's a house there from the front.

11:35.720 --> 11:39.720
You go, that looks like a nice beautiful like Bilbo Baggins Eve Gandalf house.

11:39.720 --> 11:40.720
And you get inside it.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.720
You can get lost in the cocksucker.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.720
You can actually hang a wrong turn.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.720
And you go, okay, I do remember how to get back to the wine cellar.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.720
I know that there was a pool table, but you can't.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.720
And I think it's not all...

11:53.720 --> 11:55.720
The old comic...

11:55.720 --> 12:00.720
If you go to Pottery Barn, if you're lucky enough to get it before they sell out of the five

12:00.720 --> 12:08.720
that they keep on the counter, Jeff's album of covers of classics, it's called Lost in the Cocksucker.

12:08.720 --> 12:12.720
It's so beautiful.

12:12.720 --> 12:13.720
You're not...

12:13.720 --> 12:16.720
It's not original stuff, but you really bring new life into...

12:16.720 --> 12:17.720
I'd say it's all...

12:17.720 --> 12:19.720
It's only a paper moon.

12:19.720 --> 12:20.720
I do sound assailants.

12:20.720 --> 12:21.720
It's good stuff.

12:21.720 --> 12:24.720
It's mostly zither.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.720
But I feel like...

12:26.720 --> 12:32.720
The comic Joe E. Lewis from the 2030s I said, he said, money isn't everything, but it calms the nerves a little.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.720
And I think that there's a thing about wealth.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.720
If you're not...

12:35.720 --> 12:36.720
Wealth can also destroy you.

12:36.720 --> 12:42.720
Wealth can turn you into a scruge and a concussion and weaken your cells, I think,

12:42.720 --> 12:45.720
if all you care about is competition.

12:45.720 --> 12:50.720
Our people, and I think in our world, this little enclave that we live in,

12:50.720 --> 12:52.720
I don't meet rich tycoons.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.720
I don't meet entrepreneurs and shit.

12:54.720 --> 12:58.720
I meet rich comedians and singers and stuff like that.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.720
I think it may be the art that keeps them young.

13:00.720 --> 13:08.720
But I think there's a way to grow old gracefully, and certainly money doesn't hurt.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.720
Speaking of...

13:10.720 --> 13:12.720
No, fuck that.

13:12.720 --> 13:18.720
All right, so here's a new segment called, what am I doing?

13:18.720 --> 13:20.720
What's Dan Harmon doing?

13:20.720 --> 13:22.720
So the most boring segment we've ever done.

13:22.720 --> 13:23.720
Let's get it out of the way.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.720
Do you have a boring song?

13:24.720 --> 13:25.720
A boring song?

13:25.720 --> 13:27.720
That song I almost started the show with.

13:27.720 --> 13:42.720
What's Dan Harmon doing this week on a schedule?

13:42.720 --> 13:47.720
So tomorrow morning I'm going in.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.720
You guys may have seen me on Twitter or the whatnot,

13:50.720 --> 13:56.720
making fun of the fact that there's this Dungeons & Dragons anthology on tape coming out, on tape.

13:56.720 --> 14:00.720
It's on ceramic disc, I think.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.720
On audible bit bites.

14:02.720 --> 14:06.720
Ice-T did this Dungeons & Dragons thing.

14:06.720 --> 14:11.720
And he was interviewed about it, I guess he was saying things like,

14:11.720 --> 14:13.720
Yes, weirdest thing I ever read.

14:13.720 --> 14:17.720
It's a bunch of gobbledygook.

14:17.720 --> 14:20.720
I've been doing my impression of Ice-T.

14:20.720 --> 14:27.720
Stignots the orc came down the mountain wielding his axe plus three.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.720
It wasn't personal.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.720
It was business.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.720
Wait, can I pause real quick?

14:33.720 --> 14:34.720
Sure.

14:34.720 --> 14:38.720
Because I currently have 14 questions.

14:38.720 --> 14:42.720
Question number one, a dungeon master, he's narrating?

14:42.720 --> 14:43.720
He's reading an outline?

14:43.720 --> 14:45.720
He's reading an audible book.

14:45.720 --> 14:50.720
It's a D&D book.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.720
Thanks a lot.

14:54.720 --> 15:01.720
What a lighthouse.

15:01.720 --> 15:05.720
In my stammering, the only words I had were D&D book.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.720
Like a player's guide or a monster manual?

15:07.720 --> 15:11.720
Adam?

15:11.720 --> 15:16.720
Okay, Adam.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.720
They're not saying boo, they're saying Adam.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.720
I was saying boo.

15:21.720 --> 15:26.720
He's doing a D&D novel and he talked on his podcast, which he now has,

15:26.720 --> 15:30.720
about how motherfuckers have maps for places that don't even exist.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.720
It's ridiculous.

15:32.720 --> 15:38.720
I read this to my D-group and we named our group places that don't motherfucking exist.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.720
Did someone put him up to this or something genius producers say?

15:40.720 --> 15:42.720
He has a bad agent.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.720
I don't know, because it's not like he wants for money,

15:44.720 --> 15:47.720
although in other interviews he's said that he basically,

15:47.720 --> 15:49.720
Joel McHale is like this.

15:49.720 --> 15:54.720
Sometimes no matter how much money you have, you might be driven by a work ethic.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.720
Maybe Ice-T has this.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.720
Maybe he's Irish, I don't know.

15:57.720 --> 16:01.720
He wanted to get a book out so everybody would know that his voice should not just be on comedy bang bang.

16:01.720 --> 16:06.720
Anyways, I tweeted about it and I was so taken with the idea of Ice-T.

16:06.720 --> 16:10.720
Then a day, a Dutchess of the Dragons book on tape.

16:10.720 --> 16:14.720
The next day I get an email inviting me to be one of the people.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.720
On Ice-T's D&D thing?

16:16.720 --> 16:20.720
Well, it's not, I will be a label mate with Ice-T, you would say.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.720
What the fuck?

16:22.720 --> 16:26.720
So they ask, will you come in and do this thing and I'm doing it tomorrow morning.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.720
Here are my other label mates.

16:28.720 --> 16:31.720
Here are the other people that are doing, that are reading the thing.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.720
Michael Chickliss.

16:33.720 --> 16:34.720
Nice.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.720
Now I'm gonna breeze through some names that maybe you know.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.720
Felicia Day.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.720
Melissa Roche.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.720
Roche.

16:42.720 --> 16:43.720
Tom Felton.

16:43.720 --> 16:44.720
Greg Grunberg.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.720
Weird Al Jankovic.

16:46.720 --> 16:47.720
Yeah.

16:47.720 --> 16:48.720
Yeah.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.720
It makes sense.

16:50.720 --> 16:51.720
Wait, Ice-T.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.720
Wait, wait, what's Al Jankovic?

16:53.720 --> 16:56.720
Deposed Ukrainian.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.720
Not that uptight cocksucker.

16:58.720 --> 16:59.720
Alan.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.720
Fuck him.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.720
Uh, the Ice-T, Will Wheaton.

17:04.720 --> 17:05.720
Yeah.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.720
Here's where my kneecaps go all buttery.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.720
David Duchovama fucking me.

17:11.720 --> 17:12.720
What?

17:12.720 --> 17:14.720
David Duchovama fucking me.

17:14.720 --> 17:16.720
David Duchovama fucking me.

17:16.720 --> 17:17.720
David Duchovny.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.720
How many, if you've listened to all the 89 episodes of this podcast,

17:20.720 --> 17:24.720
you know that instinctively when I talk about a sexy man,

17:24.720 --> 17:26.720
I blurt out David Duchovny.

17:26.720 --> 17:27.720
Wait, okay.

17:27.720 --> 17:31.720
Okay, Dan, maybe I'm behind the ball here,

17:31.720 --> 17:35.720
but like, there is a, he started doing this?

17:35.720 --> 17:37.720
The Ice-T's project?

17:37.720 --> 17:38.720
No, it's not Ice-T's project.

17:38.720 --> 17:39.720
They got them to read the books.

17:39.720 --> 17:40.720
They all write the books.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.720
They brought him in and now they're bringing me in.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.720
Who is this thing?

17:43.720 --> 17:46.720
It's a kind of fellowship of, like, like, you know,

17:46.720 --> 17:48.720
as Aaron said, I want to see this pilot

17:48.720 --> 17:50.720
with these people being locked in a cabin.

17:50.720 --> 17:51.720
Exactly.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.720
I have one more name to tell you.

17:52.720 --> 17:53.720
Okay.

17:53.720 --> 17:54.720
Sean Astin.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.720
And, oh, and Danny Pudi, they were, at the time of this email,

17:57.720 --> 17:59.720
they were going to try to get Danny Pudi.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.720
David Duchovny.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.720
Is it a television project?

18:03.720 --> 18:05.720
No, it's audio books.

18:05.720 --> 18:06.720
It's reading a thing.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.720
It's a book on tape.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.720
You said pilot.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.720
I didn't say pilot.

18:12.720 --> 18:13.720
Oh, I heard pilot.

18:13.720 --> 18:14.720
Sorry.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.720
Ice-T came in, chapter one.

18:17.720 --> 18:22.720
Gribknops had had it.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.720
Did he write the book?

18:24.720 --> 18:26.720
Down to three hit points.

18:26.720 --> 18:30.720
Things were not looking good for Tordek the Dwarf.

18:30.720 --> 18:35.720
A moderate heel-wounds spell took care of the last of the concerns.

18:35.720 --> 18:36.720
So you'll...

18:36.720 --> 18:39.720
However, business remained.

18:39.720 --> 18:42.720
So he'll do that, and then I'm going to come in and be like,

18:42.720 --> 18:45.720
meow, also, here's another thing.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.720
That was a really good Dan Harmon.

18:47.720 --> 18:48.720
All right, thank you.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.720
Adam Goldberg, thanks for coming out there.

18:51.720 --> 18:52.720
Adam, really?

18:52.720 --> 18:53.720
Yeah.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.720
I mean, boy, that couldn't have happened from the audience.

18:55.720 --> 18:59.720
They call him the elucidator.

18:59.720 --> 19:03.720
Dan, I wonder, first off, a couple things.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.720
Full disclosure, I like your Ice-T impression quite a bit.

19:06.720 --> 19:07.720
Thank you.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.720
That's a very good Ice-T impression.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.720
It's nothing personal, Jeff.

19:11.720 --> 19:14.720
It's just business.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.720
I would like to hear a brief conversation

19:17.720 --> 19:22.720
between Ice-T and Vincent Price, though.

19:22.720 --> 19:25.720
Just so I can hear the...

19:25.720 --> 19:28.720
How many Gandalfs of distance are in between...

19:28.720 --> 19:31.720
So you're saying Ice-T is coming over to Vincent Price's house.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.720
He's been invited over for dinner?

19:33.720 --> 19:34.720
Certainly, yeah.

19:34.720 --> 19:35.720
Yeah, whatever you want.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.720
And he doesn't know that for dinner sometimes means I'm going to eat you.

19:38.720 --> 19:44.720
I would say that Elvis Mitchell is going to be doing an interview,

19:44.720 --> 19:46.720
but this time it's at Vincent Price's house.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.720
You've been asked over and you didn't realize...

19:48.720 --> 19:52.720
Ice-T didn't realize that he was coming into Vincent Price's home.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.720
Ding dong.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.720
Damn.

20:02.720 --> 20:06.720
Takes a long time for them to come to the door.

20:10.720 --> 20:13.720
Hello.

20:13.720 --> 20:16.720
The fuck?

20:16.720 --> 20:20.720
I'm here to do the Elvis Mitchell documentary.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.720
Yes.

20:23.720 --> 20:27.720
I hope you'll enjoy doing...

20:27.720 --> 20:31.720
I think you're trying to not be Ice-T.

20:31.720 --> 20:33.720
I'm not saying you're identical.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.720
I'm saying that their Olympic rings overlap a tiny bit.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.720
Ice-T, I presume.

20:39.720 --> 20:42.720
Please come into my house.

20:42.720 --> 20:46.720
I'm Vincent Price.

20:46.720 --> 20:50.720
All right, but it's nothing personal.

20:50.720 --> 20:54.720
No, it's business.

20:54.720 --> 20:55.720
I...

20:55.720 --> 20:57.720
You know what we should do.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.720
I think at some point Ice-T should start rapping

20:59.720 --> 21:04.720
and Vincent Price could do one of his famous thriller-style breakdowns.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.720
Yo, yo, yo.

21:08.720 --> 21:10.720
Ice-T.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.720
Ice-T gonna get with me.

21:13.720 --> 21:17.720
I got the tippy to the two, got the four to the three.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.720
Ice-T, you're gonna put sweetener in me.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.720
Cop killer on the front to the four-three.

21:23.720 --> 21:26.720
Aspect ratio, 16-9.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.720
I got the high definition and it's gonna be mine.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.720
I go down to Best Buy.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.720
I go down every aisle.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.720
I go look at VCRs by the mile saying,

21:36.720 --> 21:40.720
Will this one have a tracking problem?

21:40.720 --> 21:42.720
I don't know.

21:42.720 --> 21:46.720
I got slob phlegm in my mouth when I get a cold.

21:46.720 --> 21:53.720
I wanna go home and watch the old people roll past my porch.

21:53.720 --> 21:56.720
Yo, there's Larry Storch.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.720
He's an actor from Hawaii 5-0.

21:59.720 --> 22:03.720
I don't need your husbands or wives to go to Google it

22:03.720 --> 22:05.720
and verify my reference.

22:05.720 --> 22:08.720
I just wanna rap and experience your deference

22:08.720 --> 22:11.720
cause I'm OG to the OG-O.

22:11.720 --> 22:15.720
That means original gangster got an old in the go.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.720
I don't know what it spells all day,

22:18.720 --> 22:21.720
but I'm Ice Mother fucking T and I'm not gay.

22:21.720 --> 22:24.720
Got a cop killer bullet in my penis for a gun.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.720
Gonna, gonna rub it till I start to cum

22:27.720 --> 22:29.720
and when the sperm comes out,

22:29.720 --> 22:31.720
gonna pierce the armor of a cop

22:31.720 --> 22:34.720
and then you know I went farther than

22:34.720 --> 22:38.720
I should have gone, should have left it back

22:38.720 --> 22:40.720
when I rhymed a couple times.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.720
Yo, yo, I'm Ice T rapping hard

22:43.720 --> 22:48.720
and now it's time for me to do the Vincent Price bridge.

22:48.720 --> 22:51.720
Spiders and skeletons

22:51.720 --> 22:54.720
coming out of your closet

22:54.720 --> 22:58.720
on a spooky hallows eve.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.720
The mind reels with scariness.

23:01.720 --> 23:05.720
Fogs and fogs of scary souls

23:05.720 --> 23:09.720
blood in buckets of wolves howls.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.720
On an howl's eve.

23:12.720 --> 23:13.720
Cop killer.

23:13.720 --> 23:14.720
Yo, yeah.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.720
Cop killer.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.720
Yeah, that's all.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.720
I couldn't tell the difference.

23:22.720 --> 23:26.720
If Ice T didn't tell you Vincent Price was coming in,

23:26.720 --> 23:28.720
that could have been a very confusing album.

23:28.720 --> 23:32.720
There's a reason why, when Vincent Price got the Michael Jackson call

23:32.720 --> 23:36.720
he's like, who wants me to do a bridge in their popular song?

23:36.720 --> 23:39.720
Is it one of those people I sound like?

23:39.720 --> 23:40.720
No, this is Michael Jackson.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.720
Let me hear a recording of him.

23:43.720 --> 23:47.720
All right, okay, I'll do it.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.720
Ice T wants you to do it.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.720
Let me hear.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.720
Yo, Ice T, no, I won't do it.

23:53.720 --> 23:57.720
Okay, that was a long walk for...

23:57.720 --> 23:59.720
Sometimes I tell you a joke and then I explain it.

23:59.720 --> 24:02.720
Larry Storch was on Hawaii 5-0?

24:02.720 --> 24:04.720
I think so.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.720
I'm going to go F-True.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.720
He's on F-True.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.720
I told you not to look it up.

24:09.720 --> 24:10.720
Ice T told you.

24:10.720 --> 24:14.720
I would love to find out that Larry Storch was also on Hawaii 5-0.

24:14.720 --> 24:15.720
It's nothing personal.

24:15.720 --> 24:19.720
It's just business.

24:19.720 --> 24:23.720
The Harmontown documentary is going to be at South by Southwest.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.720
I forgot to mention that last week.

24:25.720 --> 24:26.720
Go see it.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.720
We want to fill that theater.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.720
Do we know what's going to happen with it?

24:30.720 --> 24:34.720
Or are they waiting for the festival people to decide how that will be released,

24:34.720 --> 24:36.720
distributed, shown?

24:36.720 --> 24:37.720
Oh, no.

24:37.720 --> 24:40.720
Yeah, the idea of these festivals is you show it and then,

24:40.720 --> 24:44.720
I guess, probably Harvey Weinstein will come up afterwards and go,

24:44.720 --> 24:50.720
I think America is ready to watch a movie about a fat alcoholic baby.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.720
Do nothing.

24:53.720 --> 24:59.720
Let's put this in 50,000 theaters.

24:59.720 --> 25:04.720
Barring that happening, I think it'll be in the fans' hands.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.720
I think it's a very interesting movie.

25:06.720 --> 25:07.720
I'll say one thing.

25:07.720 --> 25:11.720
It's a very fairer portrayal of me, which is a bummer for me.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.720
But that was up to you, because this thing has gone through zillions of cuts,

25:14.720 --> 25:18.720
but you kept going in there saying, no, let's not pull the punches on that.

25:18.720 --> 25:19.720
Well, don't mischaracterize that.

25:19.720 --> 25:21.720
A lot of people online are wondering about that,

25:21.720 --> 25:23.720
and I think it'll be very clear, and it will be made very clear,

25:23.720 --> 25:25.720
because my name's not an executive producer,

25:25.720 --> 25:27.720
but I think it'll be very clear when you see it

25:27.720 --> 25:29.720
that I couldn't possibly have had final cut.

25:29.720 --> 25:35.720
The deal I made with Neil was for the feels and the wheel.

25:35.720 --> 25:38.720
Do you dig?

25:38.720 --> 25:42.720
The deal I made with Neil was it's my tour, it's his movie,

25:42.720 --> 25:45.720
and I wanted to be able to try to help him,

25:45.720 --> 25:48.720
and there were a couple moments where he's doing a bit.

25:48.720 --> 25:51.720
He's saying, hey, look at that thing across the room,

25:51.720 --> 25:56.720
and I'm able to say, you should cut to that thing here,

25:56.720 --> 26:00.720
and it'll get a bigger laugh than what you're getting right now

26:00.720 --> 26:01.720
if you change it by eight frames.

26:01.720 --> 26:04.720
But I am not allowed, I wish I was allowed,

26:04.720 --> 26:06.720
which is why I can't be allowed to say,

26:06.720 --> 26:09.720
hey, you know that part where I'm really abusive to my girlfriend?

26:09.720 --> 26:11.720
Let's lift that.

26:11.720 --> 26:14.720
It would make a shittier movie,

26:14.720 --> 26:19.720
and also, yeah, I would be doing it for the wrong reasons.

26:19.720 --> 26:22.720
I think it's an interesting documentary.

26:22.720 --> 26:23.720
I can't tell.

26:23.720 --> 26:24.720
I'm required to hate myself,

26:24.720 --> 26:26.720
required to be bored by myself.

26:26.720 --> 26:28.720
I watch the movie, I go, I'm always kind of riveted.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.720
I've talked to people who've seen it, they go,

26:30.720 --> 26:31.720
I want to see the whole thing.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.720
I saw it kind of with Kate, and I watched it,

26:33.720 --> 26:34.720
and he's like, do you have any notes?

26:34.720 --> 26:36.720
I'm like, no, I was in it.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.720
My only note is I wish I could see the entire tour.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.720
It made me feel nostalgic.

26:41.720 --> 26:42.720
Which I think people will be able to.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.720
I think there's like 700 hours of things,

26:44.720 --> 26:46.720
including like 25 minutes of John Oliver.

26:46.720 --> 26:49.720
That would be worth $5 right there.

26:49.720 --> 26:52.720
There's whole, I mean, this guy shot a lot of shit.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.720
They could show 17 hours of us singing Pringles Dick

26:55.720 --> 26:57.720
and Chicken Noodle Dick.

26:57.720 --> 27:01.720
Yeah, I think what emerges is a very, very, very

27:01.720 --> 27:07.720
interesting portrait of a 41-year-old idiot

27:07.720 --> 27:11.720
that doesn't know what he's doing at all.

27:11.720 --> 27:17.720
Yeah, but I think it's interesting.

27:17.720 --> 27:21.720
There's a depth to it, too, that it has to do with the fans.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.720
That's my favorite part.

27:23.720 --> 27:26.720
I don't think you can spoil that, but the best part about it,

27:26.720 --> 27:29.720
there's interviews after lots of the shows

27:29.720 --> 27:31.720
with a bunch of people that came to the shows,

27:31.720 --> 27:35.720
and I've seen several different cuts and clips of that,

27:35.720 --> 27:37.720
and it always really chokes me up.

27:37.720 --> 27:40.720
It's really sweet and emotional.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.720
Yeah, so if you're within the sound of my voice,

27:42.720 --> 27:44.720
please come to that premiere.

27:44.720 --> 27:47.720
Whatever theater we're in, I think we're in a huge theater,

27:47.720 --> 27:49.720
and I want to fill that thing.

27:49.720 --> 27:51.720
There's a podcast, then we're watching the movie,

27:51.720 --> 27:52.720
and then we're all going to go out.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.720
I think so, yeah.

27:54.720 --> 27:57.720
Well, are we sure about that?

27:57.720 --> 27:59.720
I don't know if we're sure about that yet.

27:59.720 --> 28:00.720
No, I don't know.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.720
I mean, because they were emailing me going,

28:02.720 --> 28:04.720
like, oh, the venue might be changing and all this stuff.

28:04.720 --> 28:08.720
Anyways, why don't we put the onus on the bonus

28:08.720 --> 28:10.720
and bring out Mitch Hurwitz.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.720
Oh!

28:12.720 --> 28:19.720
Yo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:19.720 --> 28:22.720
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.720
Mitch Hurwitz, Arrested Development.

28:24.720 --> 28:27.720
Gonna fuck your mama, then give her a breath mint.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.720
Gonna fuck your mama, gonna do a Netflix.

28:29.720 --> 28:30.720
Oh, that's so nice.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.720
Fuck your mama with a hundred of my squid dicks.

28:32.720 --> 28:33.720
Oh, this is wonderful.

28:33.720 --> 28:35.720
Arrested Development.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.720
Fuck you for a season of paint and rent.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.720
Rubber stream that shit.

28:39.720 --> 28:40.720
Rub and Williams break down.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.720
Rub and Williams break down.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.720
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

28:44.720 --> 28:46.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:46.720 --> 28:48.720
Oh, no.

28:48.720 --> 28:49.720
That's all I wanted.

28:49.720 --> 28:50.720
That's all I wanted.

28:50.720 --> 28:51.720
That's all I wanted.

28:51.720 --> 28:53.720
Will you remember any of this tomorrow?

28:53.720 --> 28:56.720
Will you, like, will you hear this podcast and say something?

28:56.720 --> 28:57.720
It's a loaded question.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.720
Will you hear the podcast and say,

28:59.720 --> 29:02.720
I do not remember singing about VCR tracking.

29:02.720 --> 29:03.720
Do you even remember now?

29:03.720 --> 29:05.720
No, I'm sober as a...

29:05.720 --> 29:07.720
No, it's not that.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.720
It's just that it was such stream of consciousness.

29:09.720 --> 29:10.720
That was so impressive.

29:10.720 --> 29:11.720
That's why my rap...

29:11.720 --> 29:12.720
Oh, my God.

29:12.720 --> 29:13.720
Can you not freestyle, Mitch?

29:13.720 --> 29:14.720
Have you ever tried?

29:14.720 --> 29:16.720
No, I really haven't.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.720
I think everybody's tried at one point.

29:18.720 --> 29:19.720
I don't know that I want to start tonight.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.720
Everybody's tried to handle it at a freestyle.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.720
I was telling people today, like, Mike Schneider, a TV guide,

29:24.720 --> 29:26.720
you know that fella?

29:26.720 --> 29:27.720
I like Mike.

29:27.720 --> 29:28.720
Yeah, he's right.

29:28.720 --> 29:29.720
He has his moments.

29:29.720 --> 29:32.720
I was explaining that you and I were now best friends.

29:32.720 --> 29:34.720
I don't want to smother you.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.720
Only on stage when we keep it that way.

29:36.720 --> 29:37.720
Like, we just don't even...

29:37.720 --> 29:38.720
We won't even look at each other.

29:38.720 --> 29:40.720
Talking about the intimidating, like, nature of,

29:40.720 --> 29:42.720
like, when you're...

29:42.720 --> 29:43.720
Oh, this is ridiculous.

29:43.720 --> 29:45.720
No, I'll put you on the spot.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.720
You really, like, encapsulate wittiness.

29:47.720 --> 29:48.720
It's really ridiculous.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.720
Oh, God, no.

29:49.720 --> 29:50.720
No.

29:50.720 --> 29:51.720
You don't remind me...

29:54.720 --> 29:55.720
No, I have nothing.

29:55.720 --> 29:56.720
That's...

29:56.720 --> 29:57.720
No, it occurred to me halfway through

29:57.720 --> 29:58.720
that it's such a ridiculous thing to say

29:58.720 --> 29:59.720
to somebody on stage.

29:59.720 --> 30:00.720
Oh, this is pretty nice.

30:00.720 --> 30:01.720
But I'm so sorry.

30:01.720 --> 30:02.720
I'm so sorry.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.720
I was just talking to your fiancée.

30:04.720 --> 30:05.720
Fiancée.

30:05.720 --> 30:06.720
Right, the two A's.

30:06.720 --> 30:07.720
Who are you, Marrior?

30:07.720 --> 30:09.720
No, well, listen.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.720
I mean, I think if we're going there already.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.720
But anyway, I was just making out with...

30:15.720 --> 30:17.720
I was just talking to your...

30:17.720 --> 30:20.720
And she said you were so articulate today.

30:20.720 --> 30:23.720
Like, the soul of dropping here, yeah.

30:23.720 --> 30:24.720
Yeah.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.720
I feel more comfortable with 45-year-old people

30:26.720 --> 30:27.720
with gray in their hair.

30:27.720 --> 30:28.720
No kidding.

30:28.720 --> 30:29.720
I was a little...

30:29.720 --> 30:31.720
I wasn't thrilled backstage listening to kind of

30:31.720 --> 30:34.720
sounded maybe like dissing, you know,

30:34.720 --> 30:35.720
white people that have some money.

30:35.720 --> 30:36.720
I felt like that was...

30:36.720 --> 30:39.720
Maybe older people kind of felt like...

30:39.720 --> 30:40.720
I think it's okay to pull it through.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.720
That could hurt somebody's feelings.

30:44.720 --> 30:45.720
It really hurts.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.720
There's no danger there of anything happening, though.

30:47.720 --> 30:48.720
If you're going to have a target.

30:48.720 --> 30:51.720
Was Elvis Mitchell being very thoughtful with you?

30:51.720 --> 30:52.720
What's he like in front of an audience?

30:52.720 --> 30:53.720
He was deep.

30:53.720 --> 30:54.720
Has he ever interviewed you?

30:54.720 --> 30:55.720
No, but I listened to his interviews

30:55.720 --> 30:58.720
and he'll be talking about the movie EZA.

30:58.720 --> 31:00.720
How has he never interviewed you?

31:00.720 --> 31:01.720
Yeah, fired up.

31:01.720 --> 31:02.720
What?

31:02.720 --> 31:03.720
You've never...

31:03.720 --> 31:04.720
I'm surprised by that.

31:04.720 --> 31:05.720
No.

31:05.720 --> 31:06.720
No.

31:06.720 --> 31:07.720
Mitch, do you feel...

31:07.720 --> 31:08.720
Well, why?

31:08.720 --> 31:09.720
Because my name's Mitchell?

31:09.720 --> 31:10.720
Is that why you just thought that would be like...

31:10.720 --> 31:11.720
Yeah, because you created a list of topics.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.720
We could do 10 minutes on the name.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.720
You know, I don't...

31:15.720 --> 31:16.720
No.

31:16.720 --> 31:17.720
I haven't done it.

31:17.720 --> 31:18.720
I talked to Terry Gross once.

31:18.720 --> 31:19.720
What?

31:19.720 --> 31:20.720
Yeah.

31:20.720 --> 31:21.720
Fuck you.

31:21.720 --> 31:22.720
Did you talk to Terry Gross?

31:22.720 --> 31:23.720
No.

31:23.720 --> 31:24.720
And right in the middle of it, she said,

31:24.720 --> 31:25.720
this is fresh air.

31:25.720 --> 31:26.720
And it really was like...

31:26.720 --> 31:29.720
You know, it was like Hendricks playing the

31:29.720 --> 31:30.720
National Anthem or something.

31:30.720 --> 31:31.720
It was like...

31:31.720 --> 31:32.720
There it is!

31:32.720 --> 31:33.720
No.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.720
That's the answer.

31:34.720 --> 31:37.720
The reason why Elvis Mitchell's never sat down with you is

31:37.720 --> 31:38.720
because he's local.

31:38.720 --> 31:39.720
You're big league.

31:39.720 --> 31:41.720
And he's black, right?

31:41.720 --> 31:42.720
Is he black?

31:42.720 --> 31:43.720
I didn't notice.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.720
I don't see that kind of thing.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.720
I guess come to think of it, I suppose, yeah.

31:47.720 --> 31:48.720
Well, I have a problem.

31:48.720 --> 31:50.720
You know, I have that problem with black.

31:50.720 --> 31:51.720
Right.

31:51.720 --> 31:52.720
No.

31:52.720 --> 31:53.720
So I'm not gonna be part of it.

31:53.720 --> 31:54.720
Elvis Mitchell's black?

31:54.720 --> 31:55.720
Yes.

31:55.720 --> 31:56.720
I think he is.

31:56.720 --> 31:57.720
But Dan would know.

31:57.720 --> 31:58.720
Oh, you really should know.

31:58.720 --> 32:02.720
Now that you mention it, yes, he was.

32:02.720 --> 32:05.720
I admire your restraint in not bringing that up earlier.

32:05.720 --> 32:06.720
That's the first sentence.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.720
The first time you've ever had an encounter with a black person

32:09.720 --> 32:11.720
you didn't say the word black in the first sentence.

32:11.720 --> 32:14.720
I mean, I don't think we can forget, you know, the impression

32:14.720 --> 32:15.720
of iced tea.

32:15.720 --> 32:16.720
I don't think we should go.

32:16.720 --> 32:17.720
You know what I mean?

32:17.720 --> 32:19.720
I don't think we should just let that go completely.

32:19.720 --> 32:22.720
That is an accurate impression of iced tea.

32:22.720 --> 32:23.720
Very accurate.

32:23.720 --> 32:30.720
And any stereotypical landmines that I'm stepping on are attached to his feet.

32:30.720 --> 32:31.720
Absolutely.

32:31.720 --> 32:33.720
He sounds like that.

32:33.720 --> 32:34.720
You're channeling something.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.720
It's not personal.

32:35.720 --> 32:36.720
It's just business.

32:36.720 --> 32:44.720
I love how it ends with iced tea.

32:44.720 --> 32:49.720
Telling me this lady was raped, then murdered.

32:49.720 --> 32:54.720
It's SVU.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.720
It's him on the crime scene.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.720
It's a nasty city.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.720
What's you've been up to, Mitch?

33:00.720 --> 33:03.720
Him and his stand-up comic friend, Richard Belzer.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.720
What have I been up to?

33:05.720 --> 33:08.720
God, I'm being held accountable for so many things.

33:08.720 --> 33:12.720
I'll tell you what, I watched House of Cards.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.720
That really, that was fun.

33:15.720 --> 33:18.720
Are you, well, okay, let's talk about that.

33:18.720 --> 33:19.720
Well, I don't know.

33:19.720 --> 33:20.720
I can't say anything about it.

33:20.720 --> 33:21.720
I watched last season.

33:21.720 --> 33:26.720
Last season ended with him going jogging and turning off his Walkman or something.

33:26.720 --> 33:29.720
You know, I had no recollection of what happened in the last season.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.720
It was just sort of fun.

33:31.720 --> 33:32.720
It was fun.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.720
It was really, it was fun.

33:34.720 --> 33:37.720
And it helps, you know, it just helps you plan.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.720
It's going to sound awful.

33:39.720 --> 33:42.720
But anyway, it helps you plan your own murders.

33:42.720 --> 33:47.720
Because you see how he plans it.

33:47.720 --> 33:52.720
In case you haven't seen it, he kills a couple of people.

33:52.720 --> 33:53.720
No, here's what I didn't get.

33:53.720 --> 33:57.720
Actually, one of the things I didn't get about it, but I just don't get in life.

33:57.720 --> 33:59.720
And you kind of alluded to this earlier.

33:59.720 --> 34:01.720
Like, how much is too much?

34:01.720 --> 34:02.720
There's one scene.

34:02.720 --> 34:03.720
Have you seen it?

34:03.720 --> 34:04.720
The first season.

34:04.720 --> 34:05.720
Yeah, right.

34:05.720 --> 34:09.720
There's one scene where Gerald McRaney is talking, you know, they're threatening Gerald McRaney.

34:09.720 --> 34:11.720
They say, we're going to shut down your power plants for two weeks.

34:11.720 --> 34:12.720
That's going to be a lot of income.

34:12.720 --> 34:14.720
And I'm just always amazed by that.

34:14.720 --> 34:18.720
I used to talk to Ron Howard about that when we did a rest of the first time.

34:18.720 --> 34:22.720
And I said, you know, if I had directed Cocoon, that would have been it.

34:22.720 --> 34:25.720
I would have been like, you know, walking into restaurants and saying,

34:25.720 --> 34:28.720
Mitchell Hurwoods, director of Cocoon.

34:28.720 --> 34:33.720
I certainly wouldn't be just out there doing another one every year.

34:33.720 --> 34:34.720
What do you say?

34:34.720 --> 34:35.720
I'm not sure.

34:35.720 --> 34:37.720
I don't understand what you're saying.

34:37.720 --> 34:40.720
Well, I'm just saying that that ruthless ambition.

34:40.720 --> 34:41.720
I don't know.

34:41.720 --> 34:45.720
In all of us, these powerful men continue to play power games.

34:45.720 --> 34:46.720
Yeah.

34:46.720 --> 34:47.720
Yeah.

34:47.720 --> 34:48.720
That always confuses the hell out of me.

34:48.720 --> 34:51.720
Why is Rupert Murdoch continue to care?

34:51.720 --> 34:52.720
Why?

34:52.720 --> 34:53.720
What?

34:53.720 --> 34:56.720
Because they're competitive people and it's all about winning.

34:56.720 --> 35:02.720
They're not used to being second to anything like Carnegie and Rockefeller and those guys.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.720
They resent that someone has more money than them.

35:04.720 --> 35:10.720
And they're not measuring things in terms of like a quarter is not a quarter of a dollar.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.720
It doesn't exist to them.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.720
I would say it certainly does.

35:14.720 --> 35:16.720
I think they know exactly what a quarter is.

35:16.720 --> 35:19.720
No, but I mean, it doesn't represent a fourth of a load of laundry.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.720
It doesn't translate into goods and services.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.720
It's a measure of a video game.

35:23.720 --> 35:27.720
But it represents that bit of mortar in the brick in the house that I built with my own two hands.

35:27.720 --> 35:30.720
No, I don't think it's just a collection.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.720
I think it's just like collectors.

35:32.720 --> 35:34.720
And these guys aren't boot strappers.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.720
I mean, I don't care how many millions they were born with.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.720
They were not born poor.

35:38.720 --> 35:43.720
Some of the rubber bears, I think, were working class.

35:43.720 --> 35:46.720
Well, maybe back before money was just being invented.

35:46.720 --> 35:50.720
Maybe a couple of them by Chirico Incidents didn't have enough because money hadn't been invented yet.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.720
But money was pretty nice.

35:52.720 --> 35:58.720
I don't want to name names, but to today's tycoons, I guarantee you there's none of them that were born broke.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.720
Or we'd know their name.

36:00.720 --> 36:03.720
We'd go like, that's the guy that was born broke and is now a tycoon.

36:03.720 --> 36:08.720
Some of them are very proud of the fact that they were only given 50 million to start their Whatchamacallit...

36:08.720 --> 36:10.720
Oh, absolutely. That's Trump's story.

36:10.720 --> 36:13.720
He took 50 million and turned it into a billion.

36:15.720 --> 36:17.720
First of all, you got to put it somewhere.

36:17.720 --> 36:20.720
You could put that in a money market account. The same thing happens.

36:20.720 --> 36:24.720
And then you have a problem because you have more money and you got to put that somewhere.

36:24.720 --> 36:28.720
That's why I say I don't like it when we take on people that are white and make money.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.720
It's challenging.

36:30.720 --> 36:32.720
That's it.

36:32.720 --> 36:34.720
Thank you. Oh, nice.

36:34.720 --> 36:36.720
Like there's someone wealthy.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.720
Have you guys ever...

36:40.720 --> 36:43.720
Have Mitch, Dan, have the two of you ever hung out one-on-one?

36:43.720 --> 36:45.720
Ever gone out and had a lunch or a thing?

36:45.720 --> 36:47.720
How dare you?

36:47.720 --> 36:49.720
Yeah.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.720
Are you asking about three ways?

36:51.720 --> 36:53.720
I'm just saying.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.720
Tell them where we hung out, Mitch.

36:55.720 --> 36:57.720
I forget the name of the bar, but it was a bar.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.720
Spearmint Rhino?

36:59.720 --> 37:01.720
Spearmint Rhino?

37:01.720 --> 37:03.720
We went to the dry bar together.

37:03.720 --> 37:05.720
Goddamnit.

37:05.720 --> 37:07.720
You guys have never been to the dry bar.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.720
You guys have never hung out together.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.720
I hung out at the dry bar with Mitch Hurwitz.

37:11.720 --> 37:13.720
We just colluded together to come up with a story.

37:13.720 --> 37:15.720
He forgot the name of the place.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.720
Because he's never been there.

37:17.720 --> 37:20.720
He's been in there. We had a wonderful conversation.

37:20.720 --> 37:22.720
He and I are best friends.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.720
Jeff has some jealousy issues.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.720
He probably doesn't even know that I was the cop troller.

37:27.720 --> 37:29.440
When you were gone, he copped trouble.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.280
I listened to it and you were wonderful.

37:31.280 --> 37:32.240
Thank you so much.

37:32.240 --> 37:33.240
That is so big of me to say.

37:33.240 --> 37:34.080
Don't let him hide with you.

37:34.080 --> 37:34.920
Thank you.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.600
And I think you're great.

37:36.600 --> 37:37.440
Well, thank you.

37:37.440 --> 37:38.280
You've never listened to Mitch.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.120
Yeah, it doesn't matter who did better.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.480
No, no, this is not a jealousy thing.

37:40.480 --> 37:41.960
You said earlier, Dan, that I said,

37:41.960 --> 37:44.440
did you make any friends at the Elvis Mitchell thing?

37:44.440 --> 37:45.280
You're like, that's a friend.

37:45.280 --> 37:46.120
Yeah, I know.

37:46.120 --> 37:46.960
How do you make a friend?

37:46.960 --> 37:50.360
But I was like, are you a friend maker, Mitch?

37:50.360 --> 37:51.240
Are you a gregarious search?

37:51.240 --> 37:52.560
No, I'm not, actually.

37:52.560 --> 37:55.440
I mean, every time you talk about me as being kind of like,

37:55.440 --> 37:57.240
you'll say things like, boy, he's kind of, you know,

37:57.240 --> 37:59.480
he doesn't look neurotic, or I don't know, whatever you say.

37:59.480 --> 38:00.960
And it's like, no, I'm so neurotic.

38:00.960 --> 38:04.280
And so, you know, if I'm out with people, I embrace that.

38:04.280 --> 38:07.400
I'm always happy about it, but it takes a lot to get me out.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.600
Even when you talk about going to San Francisco

38:09.600 --> 38:11.080
and doing this tour and everything.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.640
Do you want to come to my wedding?

38:12.640 --> 38:13.760
I'd love to officiate.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.800
Are you, do you need someone?

38:15.800 --> 38:16.920
That gives me enough time.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.080
That'd be great.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.320
I would.

38:19.320 --> 38:23.040
I will, you're on the short list now, for sure.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.600
I'll be great.

38:24.600 --> 38:27.840
Are you already ordained?

38:27.840 --> 38:31.000
No, but I have time now, and I won't make it all about me.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.800
I mean, you know, that'll be, some of it, obviously,

38:34.800 --> 38:36.520
I have to have an act, but,

38:37.880 --> 38:39.760
could you, I mean, there has to be a little

38:39.760 --> 38:42.240
Robin Williams moments in the officiating.

38:42.240 --> 38:43.080
Yeah, that's right.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.880
Well, I have a lot of props around.

38:44.880 --> 38:45.720
Okay.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.240
And I'll take a plunger and I'll be, you know, like,

38:47.240 --> 38:48.920
oh, I'm a unicorn.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.960
If I can't, that wasn't Robin Williams.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.840
So, my favorite Robin Williams thing, though,

38:52.840 --> 38:56.320
is the, is the impression of the thing

38:56.320 --> 38:59.720
that doesn't exist anymore, which is the preacher.

38:59.720 --> 39:03.520
Yeah, you know, like, the preacher's still making fun

39:03.520 --> 39:04.360
of the preacher.

39:04.360 --> 39:07.680
Like, yeah, we're with you, we get it, we,

39:07.680 --> 39:11.120
he's an asshole, he doesn't, what a hypocrite.

39:12.920 --> 39:15.120
The, could you?

39:15.120 --> 39:16.440
No, but I could marry the hell out of you.

39:16.440 --> 39:19.040
I know now, because I've been, I've been married.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.880
All right, short list, it's like,

39:20.880 --> 39:22.120
there's three people on the list,

39:22.120 --> 39:22.960
and then it's all controversy.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.760
I couldn't stop sweating when I got married.

39:25.760 --> 39:26.600
It was awful.

39:26.600 --> 39:29.400
I was nervous beforehand, and I was in New York,

39:29.400 --> 39:31.280
and I thought, well, let me just go for a run,

39:31.280 --> 39:32.720
and that'll calm me down.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.600
And I went for a run, and, really,

39:34.600 --> 39:36.520
I went out into Central Park,

39:36.520 --> 39:38.360
and I ran around the whole rest of the park.

39:38.360 --> 39:39.200
You see your tuxedo running?

39:39.200 --> 39:40.200
In the tux?

39:40.200 --> 39:43.520
Yeah, of course, because you wanted to fit and move with you.

39:43.520 --> 39:44.680
No, no, no, no.

39:44.680 --> 39:47.040
No, I just, just a full spandex bodysuit,

39:47.040 --> 39:48.000
and I just went out running.

39:48.000 --> 39:48.840
Right.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.160
Just for speed, you know.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.960
This is back when you were a known strangler.

39:52.960 --> 39:53.800
Yeah.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.640
That's right.

39:55.640 --> 39:57.160
Well, I knew a lot of stranglers.

39:57.160 --> 39:58.000
I know what you're thinking of.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.280
Never convicted, but you were certainly

39:59.280 --> 40:00.240
under investigation for many years.

40:00.240 --> 40:02.800
I remember I was jogging past those kids wilding.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.480
I was like, ah, kids.

40:04.480 --> 40:05.960
I just felt like part of the scene.

40:05.960 --> 40:08.200
Anyway, I came back, and I looked at the clock,

40:08.200 --> 40:11.120
and it was, I had like a half hour, and so I,

40:11.120 --> 40:11.960
and I panicked.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.240
You know, I hadn't even tried on my tux,

40:13.240 --> 40:15.120
and I jumped in the shower, and I came out,

40:15.120 --> 40:16.480
and I'm still sweating.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.920
And then I put on the tux, and I had to walk like six blocks,

40:18.920 --> 40:21.440
and then get up on a hoopa, because at that point,

40:21.440 --> 40:22.880
I think I'd still believed in God,

40:22.880 --> 40:26.440
and we had this Jewish thing.

40:26.440 --> 40:27.280
Hoopa's the thing.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.120
I'm gonna be honest about my-

40:28.120 --> 40:28.960
But you know you're not supposed to get

40:28.960 --> 40:29.800
on top of the hoopa.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.680
That's like, you're not Gidget.

40:31.680 --> 40:32.520
Wait, you-

40:32.520 --> 40:33.360
What?

40:33.360 --> 40:35.120
You don't get on top of the hoopa?

40:35.120 --> 40:36.640
That's why they were laughing.

40:36.640 --> 40:40.000
But why it looked so triumphant.

40:40.000 --> 40:40.960
No, did I say on top of it?

40:40.960 --> 40:42.360
No, I was right, but I had to get under,

40:42.360 --> 40:44.200
I had to get on top of a stage under a hoopa,

40:44.200 --> 40:46.000
and then there was a light right here,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
and the whole time I was just like trying

40:48.000 --> 40:49.520
to casually wipe away.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.560
It was like Albert Brooks, and you know,

40:51.560 --> 40:54.080
just look, and nothing says confidence

40:54.080 --> 40:59.080
about getting married, like just a total flop sweat.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.480
Nothing says confidence about wanting to get married,

41:01.480 --> 41:03.160
like I should go take a run.

41:03.160 --> 41:05.520
Yeah, I know, I know.

41:05.520 --> 41:07.880
Literally my last run, I mean I just got-

41:07.880 --> 41:09.480
Literally running away from the scene.

41:09.480 --> 41:10.320
Yeah.

41:10.320 --> 41:12.160
Do you get in fights with your wife?

41:13.520 --> 41:15.760
Yeah, kind of, I mean I've learned,

41:15.760 --> 41:17.040
I've learned a lot about,

41:17.040 --> 41:20.640
this is what you do when, here's the move.

41:20.640 --> 41:21.480
Me!

41:22.960 --> 41:25.320
Put on some spandex to make your errands, not back there.

41:25.320 --> 41:26.160
Just run.

41:27.040 --> 41:30.880
So nobody ever wants to apologize first when you have a fight.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.400
Not when your heart is pounding

41:32.400 --> 41:33.960
and your arteries are done.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.160
Go for it.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.240
You go for it, you go for it.

41:37.240 --> 41:39.120
You don't have to mean it,

41:39.120 --> 41:44.120
and it makes them feel so much worse than any insult,

41:44.120 --> 41:47.400
any insult, you know, how could you say that?

41:47.400 --> 41:48.480
How could you say that?

41:48.480 --> 41:49.800
There's a lot of that, by the way,

41:49.800 --> 41:51.680
but we have a lot of complete,

41:51.680 --> 41:54.440
I just feel like every time, I feel like every time I,

41:54.440 --> 41:57.680
but if you dive in with like,

41:57.680 --> 42:02.680
look, I love you, I don't want you to be unhappy,

42:02.800 --> 42:04.160
so I'll take the blame.

42:04.160 --> 42:05.360
No, I'll take the blame.

42:05.360 --> 42:06.200
Okay.

42:06.200 --> 42:11.040
You know, they can't, many women can't apologize first,

42:11.040 --> 42:13.000
but they can't resist.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.920
I feel like I was always so good at what you're describing,

42:15.920 --> 42:18.960
and I feel like,

42:18.960 --> 42:21.440
I don't know if this is justification, rationalization,

42:21.440 --> 42:26.360
but I can't get out of that pit with Erin,

42:26.360 --> 42:28.920
and I have to assume it's because she intimidates me

42:28.920 --> 42:29.840
more than anyone I've been with.

42:29.840 --> 42:34.280
I find, like, I can't, I always know that.

42:34.280 --> 42:35.960
I've always been able to do that.

42:35.960 --> 42:39.680
Always been able to, like, find the high road immediately,

42:39.680 --> 42:40.880
and I can never do it.

42:40.880 --> 42:44.440
I get so, I'm so, like, mad.

42:44.440 --> 42:45.880
Actions, only half-joking.

42:45.880 --> 42:49.720
I mean, I will say that one of the keys to, like,

42:49.720 --> 42:51.920
my relationship being successful, I think,

42:51.920 --> 42:53.000
and by successful, I mean,

42:53.000 --> 42:54.680
she lets me sleep with other women.

42:54.680 --> 42:57.520
Safe crack.

42:57.520 --> 42:59.800
Yeah, I mean, that's a, that's a big success.

42:59.800 --> 43:02.880
That's, once you overcome that hurdle,

43:02.880 --> 43:05.120
matrimony becomes gravy.

43:05.120 --> 43:05.960
Yeah.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.760
No, that's not true.

43:07.760 --> 43:09.920
But it really is kind of,

43:09.920 --> 43:11.680
it is doing what I just made a joke out of.

43:11.680 --> 43:13.920
It's really trying to see that other person,

43:13.920 --> 43:17.720
because that's really what anybody wants, right,

43:17.720 --> 43:19.320
is to be seen, is to be acknowledged,

43:19.320 --> 43:20.800
and everything you're doing in a fight

43:20.800 --> 43:22.520
is sort of not seeing them,

43:22.520 --> 43:24.200
and I'm claiming you don't see me.

43:24.200 --> 43:27.280
So when I, if I can remind myself of that,

43:27.280 --> 43:29.480
I actually can sort of think, like,

43:29.480 --> 43:32.280
I mean, look at your fiance.

43:32.280 --> 43:33.120
I refuse to.

43:33.120 --> 43:34.800
I know, that's a problem.

43:35.800 --> 43:37.800
And you just go, oh, I love her.

43:38.800 --> 43:39.640
I love her even though she's-

43:39.640 --> 43:41.520
Yeah, she doesn't understand.

43:41.520 --> 43:43.880
Also, it's like, it's like,

43:43.880 --> 43:45.240
I don't know anything about Pokemon,

43:45.240 --> 43:46.800
but I know what it has something to do with weapons

43:46.800 --> 43:48.360
or something or choices of attacks.

43:48.360 --> 43:51.240
I'm doing a, I'm doing a whole audiobook on Pokemon.

43:51.240 --> 43:52.560
Next week.

43:52.560 --> 43:54.560
With the Harlem Glow Trotters.

43:54.560 --> 43:56.760
Quinch that knew his tornado attack

43:56.760 --> 43:59.720
would reduce his enemy to a confused state.

43:59.720 --> 44:00.680
Doing it.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.080
I'm doing it with three cards left.

44:02.080 --> 44:05.520
Layla Ali and I, that's Muhammad's daughter,

44:05.520 --> 44:08.240
are doing, yeah, she's, for whatever reason,

44:08.240 --> 44:09.800
they put us together.

44:09.800 --> 44:10.640
Yeah.

44:10.640 --> 44:12.960
I've done a show with Layla.

44:12.960 --> 44:13.800
Yeah, not really.

44:13.800 --> 44:14.640
I swear to God.

44:14.640 --> 44:15.680
But on Whose Lines Anyway,

44:15.680 --> 44:16.880
they brought her out as a guest.

44:16.880 --> 44:17.720
Oh my God.

44:17.720 --> 44:19.520
So Wayne Brady and I had to sing a song to Layla Ali

44:19.520 --> 44:20.600
and she was awesome.

44:20.600 --> 44:21.440
She was great.

44:21.440 --> 44:22.280
Oh, that's amazing.

44:22.280 --> 44:23.760
Also, she, you know,

44:23.760 --> 44:24.760
talk about being intimidating.

44:24.760 --> 44:26.480
Like, she's, she's a,

44:26.480 --> 44:27.920
she's never lost a fight.

44:29.840 --> 44:31.720
I've never lost a fight.

44:31.720 --> 44:32.560
Yeah.

44:32.560 --> 44:33.760
Have you ever fought Layla Ali?

44:33.760 --> 44:34.960
I've never fought anyone.

44:34.960 --> 44:35.800
But I've-

44:35.800 --> 44:37.800
Have you ever thrown a punch in anger at somebody?

44:37.800 --> 44:38.640
Have you ever actually like,

44:38.640 --> 44:41.080
like vexed her on a duke at someone?

44:41.080 --> 44:44.360
I can't, I don't think I can tell some of these stories.

44:44.360 --> 44:45.200
With your wife?

44:45.200 --> 44:46.040
Yes.

44:46.040 --> 44:46.880
It was your wife.

44:46.880 --> 44:47.720
But.

44:47.720 --> 44:48.560
Oh my God.

44:48.560 --> 44:49.800
In my defense, you know,

44:49.800 --> 44:50.960
they were children.

44:50.960 --> 44:52.280
No.

44:52.280 --> 44:53.480
And they were welding.

44:53.480 --> 44:54.960
I've come, more recently,

44:54.960 --> 44:56.000
I've come close, you know,

44:56.000 --> 44:58.920
like I do lose some sanity in those moments.

44:58.920 --> 45:00.680
I just feel like I don't care.

45:00.680 --> 45:01.640
I just remembered,

45:01.640 --> 45:03.080
and now let's bring Erin out.

45:03.080 --> 45:05.160
I punched her in the jaw in my sleep.

45:05.160 --> 45:06.000
All right, Erin, come out.

45:06.000 --> 45:06.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:06.840 --> 45:09.560
Thank God for saying in your sleep at the end of that.

45:09.560 --> 45:10.400
Yeah.

45:10.400 --> 45:11.240
I thought you were gonna say,

45:11.240 --> 45:12.800
I punched her in the jaw last Tuesday.

45:12.800 --> 45:16.800
You know, I physically assaulted Erin in bed.

45:16.800 --> 45:17.640
Yeah.

45:17.640 --> 45:20.960
I was having, we just watched Demolition Man.

45:20.960 --> 45:24.440
And I fell asleep and in my dream,

45:24.440 --> 45:27.880
I was fighting Sylvester Stallone in a ring.

45:27.880 --> 45:30.680
Like I was boxing him and he kept punching me.

45:30.680 --> 45:32.720
And I got, I was getting so frustrated.

45:32.720 --> 45:34.040
Because your arms aren't moving.

45:34.040 --> 45:36.880
Right, you know, and then I finally like,

45:36.880 --> 45:41.880
and I woke up and something was weird in the bed.

45:42.320 --> 45:46.320
Like I had moved and my fiance is in bed next to me going,

45:46.320 --> 45:50.120
ow, a massaging her jaw.

45:50.120 --> 45:54.120
And I'm going, I slowly, I punched, I've done it.

45:54.120 --> 45:57.760
I mean, I have, and my excuse really was it's a lame,

45:57.760 --> 46:00.040
but I, you know, my wife said you punched her.

46:00.040 --> 46:02.440
Well, next one, you and I were together a year ago.

46:02.440 --> 46:07.440
No, no, he almost never punches, no, but I, she, I said,

46:07.960 --> 46:09.440
she said, what's the matter with you?

46:09.440 --> 46:10.280
You just punched me and woke me up.

46:10.280 --> 46:12.320
I said, well, I was defending you.

46:12.320 --> 46:13.960
Which I really thought at the time,

46:13.960 --> 46:16.560
because that was what was happening in the dream, but.

46:16.560 --> 46:17.400
Yeah.

46:17.400 --> 46:19.960
So I mean, Dan, we've talked about this on the show before.

46:19.960 --> 46:24.800
Dan really is very, he's so verbose in his sleep

46:24.800 --> 46:25.800
in a weird way.

46:25.800 --> 46:28.800
And I like a haunting way because it's not.

46:28.800 --> 46:29.640
It's riveting.

46:29.640 --> 46:32.920
I imagine most people when they speak in their sleep

46:32.920 --> 46:35.520
sound kind of drunk or disoriented,

46:35.520 --> 46:38.560
but Dan speaks very clearly and very like frightening,

46:38.560 --> 46:41.440
weird, non-secular, non-sequiturs.

46:41.440 --> 46:43.280
Also, non-secular though.

46:43.280 --> 46:44.120
Non-secular.

46:44.120 --> 46:46.240
I get down to mythological.

46:46.240 --> 46:47.240
There is no God.

46:47.240 --> 46:49.240
God, walk down from, yeah.

46:50.240 --> 46:52.160
I actually think it's the best part of the documentary

46:52.160 --> 46:53.520
I saw in early cut.

46:53.520 --> 46:56.320
So the, and that stuff of you asleep,

46:56.320 --> 46:59.880
What if you spoke in your sleep, but I was all a gospel.

46:59.880 --> 47:02.640
Yeah, Dan speaks in his sleep a lot.

47:02.640 --> 47:06.000
And we actually, the other night when I was watching

47:06.000 --> 47:08.840
when Dan falls asleep, I'll watch a shitty movie

47:08.840 --> 47:09.680
for a comfort.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.200
And Dan, well, we've talked about this before.

47:11.200 --> 47:12.920
This is after you've watched Demolition Man.

47:12.920 --> 47:13.760
Then you'll watch it.

47:13.760 --> 47:14.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:14.760 --> 47:16.600
Then I'll go lowbrow.

47:16.600 --> 47:17.440
Got it.

47:17.440 --> 47:18.280
Yeah, yeah.

47:18.280 --> 47:20.280
There's Dan's version of a shitty movie.

47:20.280 --> 47:22.840
And there's my version of a comforting movie

47:22.840 --> 47:24.400
that I've never seen before.

47:24.400 --> 47:26.440
There's my version of a comforting movie,

47:26.440 --> 47:29.720
like my best friend's wedding or et cetera, et cetera.

47:29.720 --> 47:31.320
And Dan will wake up in the middle of his sleep

47:31.320 --> 47:34.720
and say, well, I mean, if you're not in love,

47:34.720 --> 47:37.000
I mean, why don't you just fuck everybody at the wet

47:37.000 --> 47:38.400
and just fall back asleep?

47:38.400 --> 47:43.400
And I feel all the shame because it doesn't feel like

47:44.120 --> 47:44.960
it's talking in its sleep.

47:44.960 --> 47:47.360
She actually, you, like this is not a real,

47:47.360 --> 47:49.520
like you a couple of nights ago.

47:49.520 --> 47:51.720
It's a one sided thing because you don't remember any of it.

47:51.720 --> 47:52.880
You got up and left the bedroom

47:52.880 --> 47:55.880
because I was about to fall asleep and you,

47:55.880 --> 47:58.160
this is a milestone in our relationship.

47:58.160 --> 48:00.920
You left the bedroom to go finish watching

48:00.920 --> 48:03.120
a romantic comedy in a different room

48:03.120 --> 48:07.400
because you knew, air quotes, knew

48:07.400 --> 48:10.000
that if you continued watching it in bed,

48:10.000 --> 48:11.960
I would have notes in my sleep.

48:11.960 --> 48:12.800
Yeah.

48:12.800 --> 48:13.640
And I wasn't mad.

48:13.640 --> 48:16.680
I kissed you and patted your bottom

48:16.680 --> 48:18.760
and I walked into the other room and...

48:18.760 --> 48:20.000
You powdered his bottom?

48:20.000 --> 48:23.240
I patted his bottom.

48:23.240 --> 48:24.560
That's how he likes to be greeted.

48:24.560 --> 48:25.560
You know that.

48:25.560 --> 48:27.160
My bottom self powders.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.120
Gross.

48:30.120 --> 48:31.880
No, that's beautiful.

48:31.880 --> 48:32.720
Gross, gross.

48:32.720 --> 48:34.040
I think that's beautiful.

48:34.040 --> 48:34.880
Thank you.

48:34.880 --> 48:38.160
I got up, he woke up in his sleep again

48:38.160 --> 48:40.640
and had a criticism for the very shitty movie

48:40.640 --> 48:43.000
I was watching, which is like telling somebody

48:43.000 --> 48:44.760
that Cheetos are bad for you.

48:44.760 --> 48:45.600
Yes, I know.

48:45.600 --> 48:46.440
I know.

48:46.440 --> 48:47.280
But I'm sleeping.

48:47.280 --> 48:48.120
Yeah.

48:48.120 --> 48:48.960
What?

48:48.960 --> 48:49.800
I'm sleeping.

48:49.800 --> 48:51.320
But then you wake up,

48:51.320 --> 48:55.280
but this is why we've evolved as a couple

48:55.280 --> 48:57.080
because you woke up and you,

48:57.080 --> 48:59.440
I was, I hate to tell you guys what I was watching.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.720
I was watching how to lose a guy in 10 days.

49:01.720 --> 49:03.040
Oh.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.440
How to lose an audience in eight seconds.

49:06.560 --> 49:08.120
Dan, wake up, Dan, wake up.

49:09.560 --> 49:11.120
You just did it again, Dan.

49:11.120 --> 49:11.960
Fuck that movie.

49:11.960 --> 49:13.640
Which is a terrible movie.

49:13.640 --> 49:16.080
And it's like watching it as a woman,

49:16.080 --> 49:19.160
like it's really like sexist and crazy.

49:19.160 --> 49:21.880
But like, just the way,

49:21.880 --> 49:23.760
the truth is that I like,

49:23.760 --> 49:28.520
I like Matthew McConaughey's voice is like a song.

49:28.520 --> 49:30.000
Then watch True Detective.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.080
Woo!

49:31.080 --> 49:31.920
I knew!

49:32.920 --> 49:34.440
Woo!

49:34.440 --> 49:35.280
Wow.

49:35.280 --> 49:36.120
Wow.

49:36.120 --> 49:37.360
It's so interesting.

49:37.360 --> 49:38.200
Ha ha ha.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.040
Woo!

49:41.920 --> 49:46.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, True Detective, yeah, yeah.

49:46.080 --> 49:48.280
True Detective on HBO.

49:48.280 --> 49:50.920
It's a, it's an early show, you got, take off.

49:50.920 --> 49:53.600
It's a serialized miniseries,

49:53.600 --> 49:57.440
so it's uneligible for a different award category.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.280
The truth is like, I'm so into True Detective,

50:05.280 --> 50:08.360
I wanted more McConaughey, and I was watching it.

50:08.360 --> 50:10.120
Then watch Dallas Buyer's club.

50:10.120 --> 50:11.440
Dan!

50:11.440 --> 50:13.320
Here it comes, here it comes.

50:13.320 --> 50:16.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:16.800 --> 50:18.920
If you're a redneck with AIDS,

50:18.920 --> 50:22.360
what, what you gonna do when your society's made?

50:22.360 --> 50:25.240
Your bakery of your, and your health care.

50:25.240 --> 50:28.080
We are gonna go ring the bear.

50:28.080 --> 50:30.720
New, new vitamins from Mexico.

50:37.720 --> 50:39.680
Well thanks Dan, I haven't seen that yet.

50:40.840 --> 50:43.880
I, I watched it because like, I have, I, I watched,

50:43.880 --> 50:45.680
I thought that'd be great if that was the musical event

50:45.680 --> 50:47.000
at the Oscars, by the way.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.240
It's like, you know, like they just didn't get,

50:49.240 --> 50:51.520
like at the last minute, like Dan,

50:51.520 --> 50:53.520
we heard you do an amazing tribute.

50:55.600 --> 50:59.040
We haven't seen your Filomena, I'm sure it's amazing.

50:59.040 --> 51:02.520
I know I'm not alone, and like the, the amazing discovery

51:02.520 --> 51:05.440
that Matthew McConaughey is a, is a great actor.

51:05.440 --> 51:08.960
So it's funny watching him in these really shitty movies.

51:08.960 --> 51:10.720
So anyway, so, so you will see-

51:10.720 --> 51:13.640
Then watch Surf's Up, bro.

51:13.640 --> 51:15.760
Wait, what's it come?

51:15.760 --> 51:16.840
Surfer, surfer.

51:19.440 --> 51:21.080
Anyway, Dan woke up out of his sleep

51:21.080 --> 51:23.080
and criticized the movie, and I was like, you know what?

51:23.080 --> 51:25.200
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to the other room

51:25.200 --> 51:26.880
because I know this is wrong.

51:26.880 --> 51:28.360
It's like I was doing crack and bedding.

51:28.360 --> 51:30.360
I was like, don't do a crack and bed, yes I know, yes.

51:30.360 --> 51:32.480
I'll do it in the other room.

51:32.480 --> 51:33.560
So I kissed him, goodbye.

51:33.560 --> 51:35.080
That movie's a piece of shit.

51:36.920 --> 51:39.360
I fell asleep at the point where that movie

51:39.360 --> 51:44.360
spent 10 minutes depicting, in real time,

51:44.440 --> 51:46.880
Kate Hudson learning to play a card game.

51:48.280 --> 51:51.840
Yeah, she spends 10, 10 minutes of that movie.

51:51.840 --> 51:53.080
What game?

51:53.080 --> 51:54.080
It's called Bullshit.

51:54.080 --> 51:55.240
It's really charming.

51:55.240 --> 51:57.600
It's kind of like in Goodwill Hunting when they just

51:57.600 --> 52:00.760
take eight minutes to just tell you a street joke.

52:00.760 --> 52:01.760
It's just a story point.

52:01.760 --> 52:02.600
It's not a good movie.

52:02.600 --> 52:03.760
Oh, mini driver, tell us a joke.

52:03.760 --> 52:05.120
Okay, I'm gonna tell you this joke.

52:05.120 --> 52:06.960
All right, once upon a time.

52:06.960 --> 52:11.160
And there's no, this is a medium that invented the montage.

52:11.160 --> 52:13.160
Fucking move past it.

52:13.160 --> 52:15.520
Show a calendar page going like this.

52:15.520 --> 52:20.120
Come back and say, oh, mini driver, what a great joke.

52:20.120 --> 52:22.760
The Lumiere Brothers knew to do that.

52:24.240 --> 52:26.360
You fucking forgot it now?

52:26.360 --> 52:27.520
Now?

52:27.520 --> 52:29.960
My life is trickling away.

52:31.160 --> 52:35.520
So does two pair, does that beat a full house?

52:35.520 --> 52:36.360
She's just us.

52:36.360 --> 52:37.280
Go back to the start.

52:37.280 --> 52:38.680
Wow, the game of bullshit.

52:38.680 --> 52:41.480
You gotta call bullshit when you call bullshit.

52:41.480 --> 52:43.520
No, okay, bullshit.

52:43.520 --> 52:45.760
You're supposed to be so delighted by the whole thing.

52:45.760 --> 52:46.600
And I just want to.

52:46.600 --> 52:47.440
It must have been notes.

52:47.440 --> 52:49.360
Matt's mom has a voice, it's like a heart.

52:49.360 --> 52:52.040
Oh no, his voice is like a guy who's trying not to project.

52:52.040 --> 52:53.080
He's just doing that.

52:53.080 --> 52:54.480
He's just doing that movie.

52:54.480 --> 52:56.080
No, that voice reaches me.

52:56.080 --> 52:57.920
He's trying to be, he's trying to be.

52:57.920 --> 53:01.600
All right, all right, all right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:01.600 --> 53:03.680
If you don't exhale as you talk,

53:03.680 --> 53:06.480
anybody can sound like Matthew McConaughey.

53:06.480 --> 53:10.280
It's just, it's nothing, it's nothing.

53:10.280 --> 53:13.560
His voice is like always covered in icing.

53:13.560 --> 53:15.320
It's like a Christian Slater started his career

53:15.320 --> 53:17.440
trying to sound like Nicholson, which is true by the way.

53:17.440 --> 53:21.040
Which is true because my friend Jimmy knows his mother.

53:21.040 --> 53:22.960
Or a night Christian Slater.

53:22.960 --> 53:24.280
Yeah, exactly.

53:24.280 --> 53:27.120
You named my other voice crush, pump up the volume,

53:27.120 --> 53:28.480
like Christian Slater.

53:28.480 --> 53:29.320
Yeah, yeah, but also.

53:29.320 --> 53:31.240
You know, there's just copies of other guys

53:31.240 --> 53:34.320
because Matthew McConaughey is doing Paul Newman.

53:34.320 --> 53:37.280
Sure, well, I don't know, really?

53:37.280 --> 53:38.840
Yeah, oh, definitely.

53:38.840 --> 53:40.680
But still that doesn't, I mean,

53:40.680 --> 53:43.040
I still appreciate Christian Slater's voice.

53:43.040 --> 53:44.960
I think Paul Newman's a million times cooler

53:44.960 --> 53:46.040
and sexier than Christian Slater.

53:46.040 --> 53:47.600
I mean, not now, but yeah, right.

53:47.600 --> 53:52.160
I like when Kurt Russell and Big Trouble

53:52.160 --> 53:54.080
and Little China is doing John Wayne,

53:54.080 --> 53:55.760
and that's great because he's just really,

53:55.760 --> 53:57.560
he just picks one movie to be John Wayne

53:57.560 --> 53:59.000
and then that's hilarious.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.760
Also that movie, that holds up.

54:00.760 --> 54:02.320
Yeah, it does hold up.

54:02.320 --> 54:03.160
Big Trouble, Little China.

54:03.160 --> 54:06.160
May I make a little announcement really quick?

54:06.160 --> 54:07.000
Uh-oh.

54:07.000 --> 54:07.840
Pricker.

54:07.840 --> 54:08.680
Impossible.

54:08.680 --> 54:09.760
Pricker.

54:09.760 --> 54:11.600
Congratulations, Anatoly.

54:11.600 --> 54:12.440
You did it.

54:12.440 --> 54:13.280
You did it.

54:17.280 --> 54:18.720
He was pointing out to me that I was a little hard

54:18.720 --> 54:19.560
on you last week.

54:19.560 --> 54:20.680
I'm sorry, I adore you.

54:20.680 --> 54:21.520
And you look great.

54:21.520 --> 54:23.240
Look, a Wes Anderson in the front row.

54:25.040 --> 54:26.040
Quick announcements.

54:26.040 --> 54:26.960
Your voice is like an open.

54:26.960 --> 54:29.640
Well, he's, I mean, I think,

54:29.640 --> 54:31.520
Anatoly, come on up here.

54:31.520 --> 54:32.360
Woo!

54:33.360 --> 54:34.720
Look at this, Anatoly,

54:34.720 --> 54:36.960
every guy I did in college.

54:36.960 --> 54:38.760
Look at this, Anatoly,

54:38.760 --> 54:41.240
we would listen to Belle and Sebastian.

54:41.240 --> 54:43.040
Look at, Anatoly,

54:43.040 --> 54:45.440
he would tell me he was sensitive.

54:45.440 --> 54:47.280
Look at, Anatoly,

54:47.280 --> 54:49.560
then he was afraid of love.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.280
That was your announcement?

54:55.280 --> 54:56.120
No.

54:56.120 --> 54:59.080
The announcement is,

54:59.080 --> 55:00.040
everybody here,

55:01.080 --> 55:03.200
Dan and I are going through our house

55:03.200 --> 55:05.400
and purging a bunch of things.

55:06.280 --> 55:07.440
And...

55:07.440 --> 55:08.880
Oh, are you gonna try to sell those

55:08.880 --> 55:10.600
fucking picture frames again?

55:12.120 --> 55:13.560
This is crazy.

55:13.560 --> 55:15.480
He makes so much money.

55:16.960 --> 55:18.760
Five for $10.

55:21.680 --> 55:23.440
We have a bunch of stuff,

55:23.440 --> 55:26.160
as does, I'm sure, Jeff and,

55:26.160 --> 55:27.240
I haven't talked to you about this yet.

55:27.240 --> 55:28.080
I have no stuff.

55:28.080 --> 55:28.920
I know.

55:28.920 --> 55:30.080
I live like a Quaker.

55:31.240 --> 55:33.840
I have one chair and no one's allowed to sit.

55:33.840 --> 55:36.960
Dan and I have a lot of furniture.

55:36.960 --> 55:39.120
There's a lot of old community stuff

55:39.120 --> 55:41.600
and there's a lot of like extra promotional things.

55:41.600 --> 55:44.480
And I'm somebody who loves garage sales.

55:44.480 --> 55:46.760
I'm also someone who loves A26LA.

55:46.760 --> 55:48.320
Are you guys familiar with A26LA,

55:48.320 --> 55:50.640
which supports kids learning how to write?

55:50.640 --> 55:53.360
So we're having a Harmontown garage sale

55:53.360 --> 55:55.560
which will basically be Dan and I

55:55.560 --> 55:58.680
taking all of our things and putting them in this room.

55:58.680 --> 56:01.680
All the proceeds going to A26LA.

56:01.680 --> 56:05.520
It's gonna happen on March 23rd from 11 to 6 p.m.

56:05.520 --> 56:07.440
I'm gonna be making a bunch of cakes.

56:07.440 --> 56:10.120
We'll have a lot of dirty underwear lined up.

56:11.680 --> 56:12.920
Not literally dirty underwear,

56:12.920 --> 56:14.240
but a lot of clothes and things.

56:14.240 --> 56:17.840
And just a ton of stuff.

56:17.840 --> 56:20.840
And if you love Dan or love Harmontown

56:20.840 --> 56:22.600
or just love things, come on out.

56:22.600 --> 56:24.720
March 23rd in support of charity.

56:24.720 --> 56:27.640
Everything will be garage sale priced.

56:28.600 --> 56:29.440
That's it.

56:29.440 --> 56:30.760
End of an output.

56:30.760 --> 56:31.600
Very nice.

56:33.600 --> 56:34.440
Very nice.

56:35.640 --> 56:38.960
Mitch is going to be donating a lot of his new,

56:38.960 --> 56:41.640
he's writing a new script and he's gonna put it on a thing.

56:41.640 --> 56:44.000
Yeah, all of his ideas, his whiteboards.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.160
All my stuff is brand new.

56:46.160 --> 56:48.080
Cause I just throw away anything that,

56:48.080 --> 56:49.440
I sort of live this,

56:49.440 --> 56:51.600
I mean, I don't know if it's environmentally sound.

56:51.600 --> 56:54.080
We think it is, it's recyclable.

56:54.080 --> 56:57.440
Everything is constantly new in our house.

56:57.440 --> 56:59.160
I mean, I like this jacket.

56:59.160 --> 57:00.000
It's in the trash tomorrow.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.600
You were feeling sexy when you got dressed tonight, right?

57:02.600 --> 57:04.480
You were feeling very sexy when you got dressed tonight.

57:04.480 --> 57:05.640
You clearly,

57:05.640 --> 57:06.480
That really?

57:06.480 --> 57:07.320
Yeah, I did.

57:07.320 --> 57:08.160
Does it seem that way?

57:08.160 --> 57:09.000
Knock it off!

57:09.000 --> 57:10.680
Sorry.

57:10.680 --> 57:12.240
Dan, wake up, wake up, Dan.

57:12.240 --> 57:13.080
Wake up.

57:14.520 --> 57:16.160
That's nice of you to say.

57:16.160 --> 57:17.000
Hi, he looks.

57:19.160 --> 57:21.000
I'd like to pay myself a compliment,

57:21.000 --> 57:23.960
but when I woke up from the love of my life

57:23.960 --> 57:25.520
punching me in the mouth,

57:25.520 --> 57:27.920
I was like, we'll talk about it in the morning

57:27.920 --> 57:29.200
and just put a pillow between us.

57:29.200 --> 57:30.280
I went back to sleep.

57:30.280 --> 57:34.520
You are the second woman in 41 years

57:34.520 --> 57:37.560
that I have physically assaulted in my sleep.

57:38.440 --> 57:39.280
Aw.

57:39.280 --> 57:40.120
Aw.

57:40.120 --> 57:40.960
Aw.

57:40.960 --> 57:41.800
Aw.

57:41.800 --> 57:42.640
Aw.

57:42.640 --> 57:43.480
Aw.

57:43.480 --> 57:44.320
Aw.

57:44.320 --> 57:45.160
Aw.

57:45.160 --> 57:46.000
Aw.

57:46.000 --> 57:46.840
That was a third time,

57:46.840 --> 57:50.280
That was a third time I've been assaulted by that dance.

57:50.280 --> 57:52.400
My girlfriend, Alison,

57:53.320 --> 57:54.480
in my 20s,

57:54.480 --> 57:57.000
we went to visit my parents in Florida.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.440
Wait, Alison with the flat nose?

57:58.440 --> 57:59.280
Alison with that bro.

57:59.280 --> 58:00.120
Yeah.

58:00.120 --> 58:01.960
She dated, she dated Elvis Gustav.

58:01.960 --> 58:04.400
She's sleeping in our parents' guest room

58:04.400 --> 58:05.800
and I,

58:05.800 --> 58:10.160
at the time I was reading a lot of alien abduction books

58:10.160 --> 58:12.560
because I was writing a script

58:13.600 --> 58:15.840
that was going to be an alien abduction comedy

58:15.840 --> 58:20.440
that I hoped that perhaps Mr. Sandler might read.

58:20.440 --> 58:23.120
Who knows?

58:23.120 --> 58:26.080
Can I James as lead alien?

58:26.080 --> 58:26.920
But I was,

58:26.920 --> 58:31.560
and I was half asleep and you're in that weird fugue state

58:31.560 --> 58:32.720
where you think you're awake,

58:32.720 --> 58:35.000
but you're asleep or whatever.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.320
I rolled over and like,

58:38.320 --> 58:42.000
I realized that I was in bed with a gray.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.120
There was an alien face.

58:44.120 --> 58:44.960
Yeah.

58:44.960 --> 58:48.840
Like Whitley Stryber alien face staring at me

58:48.840 --> 58:50.440
on the pillow next to me and I went,

58:50.440 --> 58:51.280
Ah!

58:51.280 --> 58:53.480
And I flailed physically.

58:53.480 --> 58:55.480
I was like, get this alien away from me.

58:55.480 --> 58:57.160
The way you would with an alien.

58:57.160 --> 58:58.480
There's an alien laying in bed.

58:58.480 --> 59:00.160
You know who else has had that experience?

59:00.160 --> 59:02.880
Everyone who's ever thought they saw an alien.

59:02.880 --> 59:03.720
By the way.

59:03.720 --> 59:05.560
And you know what I mean?

59:05.560 --> 59:06.400
But anyway, quite.

59:06.400 --> 59:09.240
And it flailed and in flailing,

59:09.240 --> 59:11.120
my knuckles like hit,

59:11.120 --> 59:16.120
I mean, I hit my lover and the face getting

59:17.000 --> 59:19.440
this alien away from me and then came to

59:19.440 --> 59:21.440
and my poor girlfriend is going,

59:21.440 --> 59:24.440
you, excuse me, that's not part of the story.

59:24.440 --> 59:28.920
I've never seen anyone sneeze on stage.

59:28.920 --> 59:31.000
It's actually impossible.

59:31.000 --> 59:31.840
I'm that comfortable.

59:31.840 --> 59:34.520
I didn't know if it was possible to sneeze on stage.

59:34.520 --> 59:35.680
I don't think, I never thought it was.

59:35.680 --> 59:36.520
It was weird, isn't it?

59:36.520 --> 59:38.400
I must be allergic to entertainment.

59:38.400 --> 59:41.800
I've had that theory a long time,

59:41.800 --> 59:42.640
but now it's finally proven.

59:42.640 --> 59:43.880
But you know, what was your name?

59:43.880 --> 59:45.200
Alisa?

59:45.200 --> 59:46.040
Allison.

59:46.040 --> 59:46.880
Allison.

59:46.880 --> 59:48.720
Allison.

59:48.720 --> 59:51.480
She had a tattoo of a son in the middle of her back

59:51.480 --> 59:54.680
and a half made mermaid tattoo in the inside of her thigh.

59:54.680 --> 59:56.640
No, you're merging, you're merging two women.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.920
Allison had a sudden, sudden tattoo on her back.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.480
You're thinking of a different person

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.000
with the mermaid tattoo.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.240
Great.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:09.840
Who was that person?

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.040
Now I know there's another person.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.160
I thought it was the same person.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:17.120
I assume that son tattoo would also have mermaid thigh tattoo.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.520
That's what you don't understand about women.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:23.160
No woman would have both of those things.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.640
Son tattoo on the back girl has Japanese congee

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:29.440
that says strength on her ankle.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.360
I think we've all known that.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.120
It was a different time.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.400
And it was her own fault for probing you, right?

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.680
I mean, that might have been part of it.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:36.840
Maybe she wasn't alien.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.080
I don't know, maybe it's our true form.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.480
But I, and then, and then, and so there's,

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.480
that's the second time that I've actually

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.240
hurt someone that I was in bed with.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.680
So you woke up and your fists made contact.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.440
Right.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.360
Thank you.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.160
Matthew McConaughey reference.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.600
He was in the movie Contact.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.760
But I've told the story before.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.320
Show's over.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:00.960
Everybody out.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:04.680
I had a dream once where Bruce Willis was taunting me

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.960
and I was fighting Bruce Willis.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:12.120
And I was thankfully, thank God, I was alone at the time,

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:15.760
sleeping in a single mattress in my two bedroom apartment.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.600
And in my dream, Bruce Willis was taunting me.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.960
And I, again, with the thing where you're like,

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.000
I can't move my arms.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.160
And then you just go, I don't fuck you, Bruce Willis.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.840
If it was witty taunting, that's how you can tell.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.880
He was just smirking.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.840
He was smirking.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:32.480
Yeah, no.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.840
Like Capri or Seagram's golden wine coolers smirk.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.680
And I just lunged at him and woke up

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.040
as my fist collided with the plaster wall next to my bed.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.040
Oh, no.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.760
Like really hard.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:51.480
And the thing that always blows me away about that

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.360
is the idea that some way of looking at the universe

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.040
are unconscious dream characters.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.280
They have a life of their own.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.480
They exist because we make them exist.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:06.880
And they're accountable to our wakefulness or sleepfulness.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.320
They resent us for being gods that they can't control.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.000
They know that they're going to all die no matter what

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.720
as soon as we wake up, which Bruce does not.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.000
And one guy in the figment of my unconscious mind,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.600
one hero, this Bruce Willis guy, in one dream,

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:25.640
knowing that he was going to die along with the rest

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:29.560
of Dreamworld, like he accomplished this Promethean task.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.920
Like he bruised my knuckles.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.280
Like he reached out across the threshold

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:39.720
between sleep and awake and fucked with me.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.920
And won a fight with you.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.480
Like there would be a statue of him built outside of Dream City

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:49.040
if those fucking assholes could live past it today.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:49.440
Yeah, right.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.760
He hurt someone.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.800
He hurt one of the real people.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.560
He'd be the president of Dreams.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.800
Well, fuck Dream City because in Dream City,

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.080
they administered that fucking I can't run or walk

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.040
and the gun doesn't shoot.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.560
Nothing fucking works drug on you.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:06.800
And so they always win this fucking Dream City motherfucker.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:07.600
Fuck those girls.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.240
Is this a real thing or is this a movie?

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.480
Sweetie.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.560
Did I tell you about the dream when I was JJ from Good Times

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:19.320
and I was fucking Thelma the whole time?

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.760
You get that in every show.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.520
Unbelievable.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.000
Never.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.280
It's like it's an unmistakable agenda.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.240
OK, so amazing.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:32.600
Bruce Willis, not the sharpest dude apparently.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.000
Did you read Kevin Smith's book?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:34.520
No.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.280
Oh, it's amazing.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.640
Kevin Smith talks shit about him?

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.000
Oh, my god, yeah.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.720
And every other sentence keeps saying like,

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.120
I mean, he's a hero of mine.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.600
And what a fucking asshole.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.640
And I actually was at a party with him once.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.840
And I had like this.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.240
You were at a party with Bruce Willis?

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.520
Yeah, I was.

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.320
My friend Kevin Rooney knows all these guys

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.920
because he was a comic, you know?

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.520
Bruce Willis.

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.120
Willis, yeah.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.880
So that whole class of comics knows him.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:59.160
And he walked up and my friend Kevin was holding a.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.120
That whole class of comics.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.520
It sure is like one year, you know?

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.840
There's also a jazz musician somewhere saying like, well,

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.360
you know, Bruce was a jazz musician.

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:11.000
Well, that's his real gift.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.440
But he walked up to my friend who was holding a cookie

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.640
and he wanted to make a joke.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.640
And the joke he came up with is, what do you got there?

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.120
A donut?

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:25.280
And then he fired like this.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.720
He smirked away, wonderful.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:32.000
The little donut has a hole in the middle.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.600
And this is a, isn't that a crazy story?

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.400
I saw Bruce Willis at a bar one time.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.160
Like when I was like 24 and I was dating

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:44.200
a girl who looked enough like Demi Moore to you can say,

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:47.280
Bruce Willis might have a Demi Moore type of type.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.440
She had like the kind of like just above the shoulder

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:54.360
black bobbed hair like a similar size didn't look facially like her but I was

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:58.800
in a bar and in Hollywood and there was like it was like some sort of party for

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:02.440
something I don't know what it was and I was going to the men's room and I was

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:10.520
standing next to it to my date and he saw her from across the room and did like

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.440
it was like a Cirque du Soleil act watching him get across the room there's

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.640
people in the way and there's couches and he was doing front like like like

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:21.080
tumbles and back hand springs and he was like he grabbed like a vine that we

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.720
didn't know existed in the ceiling and swooped across and he went through an

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:29.120
air vent he had to light it with his zip-o. So a German guy with blonde hair

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.360
shot the glass and he had his shoes were off and he still made it and then the

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:38.160
only the final obstacle and I kind of see this Tasmanian devil of energy

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:45.200
coming navigating any slight breach in the wall of humanity and furniture that

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.360
was there the only thing that was finally in his way was the guy standing

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:52.880
right next to her and he linebackered me out of the way no like just like he's

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:58.320
got to lay that donut line on her probably well she was wearing a skirt

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:03.040
he couldn't wait to ask are those pants what are those pants what are you wearing

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:08.760
is that a pantser I was at a I was at a Hollywood party once wait what's the end

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.840
of this the end of the story is me getting up and everything is he didn't

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:14.800
see me he hadn't made eye contact with me and said I must destroy this guy

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:19.920
I was just simply a chess piece that was on an adjacent square that needed to be

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:24.520
like like knocked away so he could occupy that square and he just came up to her

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:29.960
and just was laying this really like heavy not charming just like like like

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:34.080
spreckensie put them like look at this memory on this whole face like I got like

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.920
you and me like I'm Bruce welles and she was like she kind of gave him the flick

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:41.920
of the shoulder like go away and he would like shrink shrink down and just

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:46.960
be crazed off and kind of unfazed it like I was off to his next weird non-conquest

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:58.360
but I wanted to go like hey I'm fucking fuck you fucking California try to eat

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:04.000
a tree stump once you tried to eat a tree stump timing was better earlier

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:13.920
I've never interacted with Bruce Willis I just thought like maybe the dumbest thing

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:42.840
well we have a surprise for you tonight thank you you must be really open mind

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:53.120
yeah who are you wrapping with who is that character you know you brings you

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.840
bring some people out and they help you out sometimes thank you thank you Cindy

01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:09.520
and you're welcome I'll be in the back trying to eat all the paper I never

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.160
realized I didn't have an ending to that Bruce Willis story I always thought it

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:15.480
was enough to say Bruce Willis tried to knock me over and actually kind of half

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:18.880
did I was like halfway to the ground before I recovered but a thing is that

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:27.480
you know it's really good you know what a good ending to that story and then he

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:32.800
went on to make like eight horrible movies that would be seven seven seven

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:39.600
Woody Harrelson gave me a black eye Woody Harrelson gave me a black eye we're

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:48.720
talking about was the black guy this is 1853 when you were allowed to give

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:57.640
someone a black guy little bow wow just what precipitated him giving you a

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:03.680
black eye through a series of unimportant events I ended up at a an

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:14.600
impromptu basketball game following the premiere of semi-pro and there were 10

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:19.120
people that were really famous and I was the only unfamous person at the UCB

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:23.080
theater and they were playing a pickup game of basketball on the stage of the

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:26.320
UCB theater which was really small and I was the only girl and Woody was like

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:34.080
hey darling come on I was like yeah and I walked down I didn't do that I was I

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:38.640
literally cute I was a little thinner and I walked down on the stage and played

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.920
basketball and Woody Harrelson I was on the other team and he elbowed me in the

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:49.200
eye like there everyone saw him like he didn't do it on purpose but he we don't

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:54.640
know that I mean I think listen when you're playing a basketball game on the

01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:00.760
UCB theater it's serious I mean you do what you have to do to make the shot I

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:06.680
guess mistakes are high when you're in the show yeah right the famous people

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:10.320
that I made it was just it was a bunch of comics but everyone was really like oh

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:13.720
my god Woody Harrelson's here Woody Harrelson's here so everyone saw him

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:19.440
like elbow me in the eye and I went to the ground and I but I would try to pull

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.320
it together but then because it was Woody Harrelson everyone's like you're

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:29.080
fine Aaron right because they're worried that the game was gonna end because he

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:33.480
was like hey darling did I hate you and I was like no but it like oh he really I

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:40.840
had a black eye for a week because of a person or maybe the only woman on stage

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:45.120
but that celebrity might might fly the coop well I mean I didn't I didn't want

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:49.160
to be wounded but I did for the rest of night everyone saw my face just get

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.400
bigger and bigger and everyone's pretending that it wasn't happening cuz you

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.440
don't want him to say something like hey man if everyone's gonna complain about

01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:00.160
me busting their eyes I'll just go

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.240
this seems like coming down here playing basketball

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:19.600
too high maintenance yeah yeah yeah what do you know what do you know I'm

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:30.840
chewing my cut yeah yeah what do you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah when you

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:36.040
rap like what are you always stop you always stop you always you give me a

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.840
look like you're done and then I don't give you I don't give you a look like

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:45.560
nothing all right I give you a look like like I'm on fire so I got to look like

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:50.080
get me out of here no I don't know about that okay now I can now again I'm not

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:54.440
saying that your iced tea and your vision prices totally you know what it

01:11:54.440 --> 01:12:01.760
sound like if Woody Harrelson and Sammy Davis Junior wrap together at least at

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:10.120
least let them introduce themselves yeah yeah yeah yeah you know I don't know

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.800
which way you're doing it yeah yeah okay they're different sides of his mouth

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:22.920
look closely you know yeah that's Sammy that was Woody that was Woody no no that's

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:28.080
Woody my name is Woody Harrelson I'm here to say I'm from somewhere in the

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.360
Midwest today I gotta when I rap I like to chew my mouth look like I'm chewing

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:36.960
from the south gotta kind of slur my lips around

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:49.880
wrap it on the ground say Woody Harrelson hey babe spiders crawling out of

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:58.280
this closet where was he spooky icky yes this was creepy crawlies babe you know

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:07.920
yeah yeah you wanted it you got it no tonight has been just a field of dreams

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:14.480
for me and believe me the last thing I would ever want to do is stop a beat

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.840
what before you were dead wrapping there was a very subtle thing going on

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:21.720
there because you know Sammy didn't write the songs he sang so he was doing a

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:30.840
song that clearly Vincent Price wrote that was a very subtle piece it's true

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:35.840
most people who have who end up doing bridges there was a guy who wrote

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:40.680
bridges to pop songs and he was a very horror oriented guy yeah so when you

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:44.040
come in you have to talk about spiders and car always the best bridge man

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:52.680
get me hey kid it's a great song I love the hook the verses are great but you

01:13:52.680 --> 01:14:01.640
bridge he writes a spooky bridge he's been Vincent Price this guy for 20

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:07.040
years but sir this is a love song we're making a lot of it's about it's about a

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:11.880
woman that I saw couldn't that be a coffin or a ghoul kids love a spooky

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:16.200
bridge kids what they want they want the monsters to mash and they want the

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:24.120
gully they want a celebrity to do it Vincent Price he owned the spooky bridge

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:27.840
yeah he did it wasn't because he was Mr. Spooky is because McClintock's words

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:32.480
didn't need that you know the piano doesn't write the concerto cock sucker

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:39.680

over for the first time into the realm of arts in fact that was that was right

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:27.200
after McClintock have had a stroke you know and he was still like we thought

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:32.080
does he still have it McClintock was a what in his 80s or he was up there yeah

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:36.360
he definitely started phoning it in yeah he would send people just stacks of

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:42.960
index cards what would say skeleton coffins yeah yeah he also made that deal

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:46.840
with Brock's candies at that point which was just tragic there was a there was

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:50.800
that billboard headline that McClintock's gunned back to the grave once

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:54.680
too many times right you know and then he did that whole Easter thing for a

01:20:54.680 --> 01:21:01.840

messiah is reborn shroud with a face imprinted on it eggs hidden

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:44.000
figure who this is I think it's Heston that was that was that Heston's a

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.200
has chop chop and Heston it was Richard was Richard Widmark I think at that

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:54.520
stage of his career there was no a list people doing his work no no he was

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:58.400
going back to the Widmarks people those are people who were selling you their

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:03.560
CD outside 7-eleven it was just with the incense it's it's a shame to see a star

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:12.360
falling McClintock yeah I'm a Clint the writer of the spooky bridge my friend

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:18.680
Jim went to meet with Jerry Lewis wants to talk about making the nutty

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:24.080
professor into a musical and one of the things that Jerry Lewis kept saying is

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:30.200
I've got a prop guy he's the best and I think of that when we talk about

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:35.120
McClintock this guy I'll call this prop guy when we're ready he's the best you

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:42.480
haven't seen a umbrella this guy has an umbrella we're gonna do a Broadway play the day the clown

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:47.360
cried the big thick screenplay that I've never seen the screen in the screenplay

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:51.960
that Jerry Lewis wrote that says about the shoes and there's an annotation that

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:57.640
says we need to discuss the shoes with props or something like that that's when

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:05.880
he found this new prop guy yeah you guys ever take a clown class I'm willing to

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:10.320
show us I take us through it right that sounded like I was about to teach you a

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.760
clown idea I thought I was sure that's what was coming next this certainly

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:17.840
sounds like we're in for a clown class yeah yeah we'd love to take a clown class

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:24.760
absolutely I asked a question because I think most people my age that were

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:28.680
theater majors you have to take a clown class and you have to reduce your

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:35.960
personality to one emotion and that is your clown dingleberry what was your

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:42.280
emotion about to yawn or something that's you know be mused resignation just

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:54.640
an about to yawn clown at all times that face you make right before those starts

01:23:54.640 --> 01:24:01.400
to flare nobody gets this what I've been doing this I traveled with this one

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:06.200
one clown competition I don't think this is totally representative of me but

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:13.120
when I was 17 my my clown was like a really careless clumsy clown whereas

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:20.000
now had you come up with that it was given to you yeah it's just it's a

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.560
pretty standard clown I mean they're not great with their hands Mitch Mitch if

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:28.080
you had to be if you're in a clown class and you had to like very quickly choose

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:33.200
your as your essential clown quality your essential car if it wasn't about to

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:40.480
yawn yeah sleepy sleepy sleepy yeah I think that a professor or actually Lucy

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:46.440
too hot would be a good clown just constantly like wedding sweater it's

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:51.640
too hot when you talk as a con is that an option you cannot talk as a club for

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:56.120
your final you cannot talk makes that makes it's too hot so let's get that

01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:00.600
one word they can go maybe they can do that right oh no really the Circus

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:07.960
Lane and you said to show the guy cuz I think I would do rethinking

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:13.280
Christianity like it would be like a clown a clown that was raised Lutheran

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:19.920
say and Catholic yeah you know and maybe it's like half the genuflection and he

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:26.880
just stares off big eyebrows all right so it's it's that at that point in the

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:31.520
show we're usually for the last eight years or so we would usually bring out

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:43.720
Spencer it's not here he's got the week off that's right well he was a Dan

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:49.280
punched him in his sleep you know Spencer was watching watching like

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:55.520
whatever chocolate and Dan we had a guy stabbed him with a butter knife we had a

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:59.360
conversation about it and it turns out hindsight being 2020 Spencer's the only

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:04.560
one who was never told unlike all of us that he didn't have to do the show if

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:09.760
he didn't want to well who told him that why was he no one ever told him

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.440
anything he just like kind of fell into this this thing and he you know he was

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:17.440
doing this thing and he felt like he had to do it or else there would be

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:21.120
horrible repercussions they didn't do it and he wasn't having a good time doing

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:26.120
it all the time and he felt forced to do it and we haven't really been up to

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:33.000
spending not that there is any like expectations that he puts on us but we

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:39.360
if there were an expectation we were underneath that expectation as D&D

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:46.040
campaigners where we don't yeah certainly by Gen Con tournament rules we

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:50.400
remember what happens we play too short us around we we all have an inventory

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:55.320
full of awesome shit that we've never used so we're to believe the word to

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:58.800
believe that there's something that he'd rather be doing than playing Dungeons

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:04.960
and Dragons on a Sunday night for free I misjudged this could we we should have

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:09.920
him tailed and see where he's at the batting cages right now he's playing

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:15.960
magic together he doesn't want to do it or anything he does he absolutely does

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:20.360
he loves doing it I think that but I would I was abhorred to find out more

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:24.080
to find to find out that he and I never really thought about it that he felt like

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:27.400
he had to do it that would I would never want anyone feeling like they had to do

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:32.440
something like Kumail texts me when we never had a single conversation about it

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:38.840
Kumail texts me every week that says either I got a I got an early call

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:42.880
time tomorrow or I'll see you tonight it doesn't matter Jeff always has a reason

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:47.560
to if he's not going to be here it's because he's got some gig and so we

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:52.200
try to replace him if we didn't the roof wouldn't necessarily cave in we haven't

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:57.920
had not had a comptroller yet but Aaron comes and goes dispenser was brought up

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:04.200
out of the odd indispensable and and never like like you put yourself in his

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:07.080
shoes and you think like he never actually had an opportunity to know

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.480
whether or not he what what if you were what if he were to come up in the

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:15.960
green room and go yeah yeah I don't want to play D&T this week I think I would

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:20.680
like to go what would you like to play we can play something else so that was

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:24.520
that moment in last week's show I think where he said like what why would my why

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:27.040
did you guys bring me up as we keep bringing him up and not talking to him

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:31.880
for like like a 10 or 15 or sometimes 20 minute span and you know it's like he

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:36.240
has every right to like to cater the show to whatever he wants to get out of it

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:39.880
you know yeah yeah I don't think there's there's it never be a single person up

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:44.120
here who's who's who's bummed out to be up I'm a little sad right now that he's

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.280
not here only because I love spence well now it's withdrawal it's like there's a

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:53.440
little table and it's like that we have to we have to on the fly we have to come

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:58.600
up with it because we've also our show is dependent on Spencer as a closer so

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:02.600
we're just as guilty as anybody of like I have a I've got a feeling there's gonna

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:08.320
be some rapid hey let's call them why don't we call them but call them we'll

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:12.560
put them on speakerphone say we and what you have to be really quiet and we'll

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:17.680
say hey man we just ended the show early and we just thought we missed you we

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:22.880
thought maybe you and I could just play some D&D my feeling was Aaron's here I'm

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:29.880
just coming up with this now we bring up someone from the audience we that needs

01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:36.560
a problem resolved I'll sit at Spencer's table and I'll I wouldn't call it

01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:42.920
dungeon mastering because there's no dungeon involved but we'll walk through

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:47.400
helping them solve their problem okay and I can I also can I add a pitch to

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:51.320
that sure maybe you can replace that pitch okay I mean I don't know how

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:54.200
easy it is to be we won't have the character sheets but we can remember

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:56.960
enough because we don't really know our character sheets all that well anyway

01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:02.560
that you go over there sit down I play the Spencer D&D intro music and you ice

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:08.280
tea dungeon master a little campaign here you can make up all the make sense

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:12.040
they give me new characters we can pick a new character be a dream sequence yeah

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:15.520
I would say you could try your hand at that at ice tea dungeon master was that

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:19.080
too heavy an impression also gives it gives you the advantage that next time

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:22.240
you talk to Spencer you can say don't worry about it it went better than it's

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:28.080
ever been you know and then and then maybe Spencer I don't want to make a I

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:32.080
don't want to make a mockery of his no I see I don't want to like use your

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.720
characters because we don't have the character sheets and all it's not yeah

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:37.720
so we can make up new characters we could do it right I mean we so I think the

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:41.680
thing would be a shallow mockery of what Spencer does very well right first

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:45.800
step is who who who in the audience somebody's already raising their hand

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:53.760
who's this young man Eric do you want to come up here I was gonna ask who has

01:30:53.760 --> 01:31:00.560
herpes Eric you can sit there yeah great no also there Eric why don't you come

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:03.200
sit up here cuz so people can see you I'll sit down there they know what I

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:05.360
look like

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:11.600
how's it going hello Eric so I had a book signing here like an hour before

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:16.920

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:23.360
try to guess your problem would that make that you had I said yeah I wrote a

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:30.760
comic book called Loki Ragnarok and role is this is so cheap plug you can put my

01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:34.200

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:54.400
of it's a little bit jaded there's a lot of stuff to do yeah it's a tough

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:59.600
market man yeah when I was your age I'm judging from the lack of pores in your

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:04.160
skin that you're about half my age I thought it worked on I I worked in

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:07.520
comic books yes you can only you know who would have bought one of those

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:11.640

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:08.720
waving your arms in a magical manner you sense that the door has an

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:14.120
enchantment spell on it it could be some kind of magical glyph could cause

01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:21.440
damage upon opening but you don't know what type okay Mitch well you know I've

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:29.640

years the ocelot you hear scurrying and scampering upside the door side

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:13.440
scampering of claws on aluminum it seems rodential but you can't be sure but I

sorry what so you telling me an ocelot went through the mail slot damn you

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:51.880
people can keep this city you hear the scurrying in after a brief bit of

01:40:51.880 --> 01:41:01.400
business nothing personal just black in a latch and the door ingresses open in

01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:08.200
wide its doorness to your surroundings the doors open I call chunky them back

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:14.960
to my shoulder where he's safe shoot hold on it's Mitch's turn Mitch you saw

01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:23.080
I fly go through a mail slot door open it was confusing I think I I go in and I

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:30.640
say guys let's keep our eye on the goal and not get sidetracked browsing flipping

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:34.760
through you know buying you always tell us what to do you always tell us what

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:46.240
yo as soon as the door opens six ogres start shooting arrows you didn't ask you

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:50.840
didn't know all you know is six ogres in the in the nonfiction section roll my

01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:58.960
evasion I'll roll your invasion when your arrows come at you I need you to all

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:07.100
roll initiative I'll roll it for you shit oh y'all got low initiative ogres got

01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:14.520
high initiative arrows coming from everywhere three coming at Jeff to an

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:26.600
Aaron one at Mitch of the three coming at Jeff one hits six damage fuck Aaron

01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:32.720
gets hit by one of her arrows the other arrow misses Mitch it flings off your

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:41.920
shoulder like a flea on a brick like a flea okay you know like a flea was on a

01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:48.800
dog no dog walk past the brick yeah and the flea took the calculated risk

01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:56.600
shut up and the flea took a calculated risk of trying to trying to transfer

01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:03.320
itself maybe maybe wasn't having luck with the flea business on the dog so it

01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:09.480
jumps to the brick because they can't tell a dog from a brick visually jumps

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:18.320
onto a brick get get no blood no dog blood doesn't matter sorry well since

01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:24.200
they seem to be kind of face-blind I guess I I try to convince them that we're

01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:31.240
ogres too that's how you want to spend your turn

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:44.480
thinking about shit no no no I advise against it I don't usually I don't

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:48.840
usually dip in but it's not a wise use of your turn just because just because

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:54.640
Mitch works for DWP he has a huge intimidation and bluff ability yeah all

01:43:54.640 --> 01:44:01.520
right well you got that's how I got the job the D what's your willpower I was

01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:08.160
three sixteen all right and you doing what I'm convincing the ogres there on

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:13.760

01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:50.240
all right the ogres seem to agree they look at each other and they're like okay

01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:57.840

01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:10.040

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:32.120
magic and the some hobbits come out outside the door and they're trying to

01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:38.240
get in but they can't get in yeah we're closed that just goes to emphasize the

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:47.160
threshold you crossed lesser heroes have failed business all right you look

01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:52.520
around you see Eric sitting behind a table he's got his comic book it's called

01:45:52.520 --> 01:46:01.120
Loki it's got ooglots above the K makes no sense it's metal it may be it's a

01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:10.520
misappropriation of an ooglots of an ancient linguistic device you get the

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:16.600
picture you it seems like he wants you to think his comic is metal but ooglots

01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:27.160
above a consonant I don't know still he's sitting there he's got a stack of

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:33.600
omis got sharpie pans like paint color I go up to the Loki comic book and I do

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:38.640
a perception check on it or like a or detect magic or something you see it's

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:50.520
about 33 pages with ads there's splash pages the art looks good I don't know it's

01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:58.200
stylized but still clean I look up and text my mom talking about the signings

01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:11.040
going really well and I wave the lettering is legible I say to Eric is

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:17.440
there we were told on our last mission that there was a there was a scribe who

01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:22.760
hit who put secret magical codes inside inside texts and we were sent in this

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:26.640
direction and I do you know anybody like that that that hides secret magical

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:31.640
messages inside books he has a no fans two thumbs and he's right here that

01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:47.800
joke doesn't work at all yes just me yeah for me I'm a dwarf with low intelligence I call my editor

01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:52.160
immediately in hand the phone to you okay the two of you are watching this

01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:59.080
happen you think they may have ass burgers we knew that was a risk when we

01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:08.280
came to a comic store what's your perception Aaron okay so you you sense

01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:14.480
no one else does there's a green gas coming down from the vents it's coming

01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:20.400
down like slowly at first no one notices but you notice maybe duck Benson's

recently incorporate your I graduated with an MBA in business non-personal

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:06.800
business seems like I loathe the personal yeah and I am I applaud the

01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:11.640
business is that what attracted you to show business yeah because it's a

01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:18.200
business yeah yeah right yeah personal show I examine my surroundings and look

01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:22.240
for staircases that might okay we're back in the game okay I'll ring that

01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:28.920
bell ring a ding-ding motherfucker okay that's the belt that's the right that's

01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:33.000

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.120
upstairs but I'm the dungeon master I understand you're doing a great job sorry

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:42.120
Mr. T. okay ice Jesus Christ man your character's living

01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:47.880
fucking hanging from a thread you know it's running around inside a fictional

01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:54.880
universe I control talking shit I'm a carious position saying you're Mr. T.

01:49:54.880 --> 01:50:00.680
like B.A. Barack I'm saying I'm the you're dressing me for me yeah I get it I

01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:03.680
get it but I see that probably that's that's something you probably get a lot

01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:07.440
and don't like that yeah yeah yeah you ain't the first to tread in that

01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:10.960
territory does anyone ever say that you sound a little bit like Vincent Price

01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:17.440
sometimes what's your move man I look around for a way to get upstairs are

01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:21.200
the stairs or some sort of way to get to the where the gas in your eyes around in

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:25.520
a visual manner you take in your surroundings you see that there are

01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:32.480
three flights of stairs one north one south one east I sent chunky the

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:36.720
also a lot up to the eastern one and because he's a he has great stuff okay

01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:43.200
you spent a turn looking shit Aaron I slot at the ready though he's at the

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:54.280
ready thank you Aaron because I see the the gas I cast a painters mask and then

01:50:54.280 --> 01:51:01.680
I I start running up the north stairs and I look back at Mitch because we have

01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:06.840
that packed from so long ago well also we just see each other I know right yeah

01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:15.560
how you guys you all need to understand turn-based combat you cast the spell as

01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:23.440
I understand it painters mask tastes one full round and it has a manual component

01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:30.760
meaning you wave your hands and a physical component as magic chalk or you

01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:36.280
have a lizard tail in your pouch that makes it possible to cast that spell so

01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:41.680
you do for all of you that are observing her if anyone's looking what you see is

01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:47.680
a mystical astro painters mask appear over her face as she runs up the north

01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:52.800
stairway now she's trying to look back but I need to check your agility because

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:57.600
you're talking to other people what you're doing it okay let me like a trip

01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:03.800
and fall on the stairs Mitch it's your turn gas is still coming down gas coming

01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:09.640
down so all the older look around at each other there's another might not be

01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:14.600
