{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:28.720\nIt is my duty, my privilege to announce that Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:28.720 --> 00:39.720\nOnce you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:39.720 --> 00:41.720\nHello.\n\n00:41.720 --> 00:57.160\nIt's watching a G.I. Joe cartoon over the weekend, Jeff, for the classic from the 80s.\n\n00:57.160 --> 01:08.000\nAnd there's an episode of G.I. Joe in which Cobra, the Joes are transported to a terrible\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:11.800\nnew dimension in a cosmic mix-up.\n\n01:11.800 --> 01:16.000\nThey are transported to a world where Cobra is in charge.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:20.080\nThey have taken over the government of the world.\n\n01:20.080 --> 01:21.960\nIt's Cobra world.\n\n01:21.960 --> 01:33.800\nAnd for instance when you buy something, they figure this out very slowly because the differences\n\n01:33.800 --> 01:36.880\nare very subtle, which I found profound.\n\n01:36.880 --> 01:40.640\nFor instance they go and buy a pack of gum and there's like a Cobra scanner that comes\n\n01:40.640 --> 01:46.160\ndown and scans your retina to make sure you can buy the gum right and that you're loyal\n\n01:46.160 --> 01:47.160\nto Cobra.\n\n01:47.160 --> 01:50.200\nAnd there's a lot of posters on the wall that are a picture of Cobra Commander that says\n\n01:50.200 --> 01:59.200\nloyalty to Cobra or else exclamation point, which is totally on the very Woody Allen approach\n\n01:59.200 --> 02:00.200\nto despotism.\n\n02:00.200 --> 02:04.040\nIt's like a heart on the sleeve kind of.\n\n02:04.040 --> 02:09.040\nBut the most interesting thing I thought about Cobra world is they're flying around, they're\n\n02:09.040 --> 02:12.520\ngoing, my God, will you look at the White House that has a little Cobra on top of it?\n\n02:12.520 --> 02:18.080\nOh no, look at the Washington Monument, it's got a little Cobra on top of it.\n\n02:18.080 --> 02:26.960\nAnd then they go past Mount Rushmore and my God, Jeff, Mount Rushmore had some of its\n\n02:26.960 --> 02:29.960\nfaces replaced.\n\n02:29.960 --> 02:31.960\nSome.\n\n02:31.960 --> 02:33.120\nNot Teddy Roosevelt.\n\n02:33.120 --> 02:34.120\nNot Teddy.\n\n02:34.120 --> 02:35.120\nYes.\n\n02:35.120 --> 02:41.080\nTeddy Roosevelt's face replaced with Destro and then I guess Jefferson replaced with Cobra\n\n02:41.080 --> 02:42.080\nCommander.\n\n02:42.080 --> 02:43.080\nI can't remember.\n\n02:43.080 --> 02:44.080\nBy the way, not famous for his face.\n\n02:44.080 --> 02:49.080\nI don't know if they upped him when the sculptor came to him.\n\n02:49.080 --> 02:51.080\nHe was famous for no face.\n\n02:51.080 --> 02:56.080\nYou know, I'm not really, my face isn't really the thing that's for sale.\n\n02:56.080 --> 03:02.080\nI have that kind of famous more for my lack of face than anything.\n\n03:02.080 --> 03:04.080\nBut probably easier to sculpt.\n\n03:04.080 --> 03:08.080\nYeah, yeah, I'm not sure the sculptor was like, slam dunk.\n\n03:08.080 --> 03:12.080\nBut I just know that George Washington and Abe Lincoln's still up there.\n\n03:12.080 --> 03:15.080\nIt's not like I'm racist or something.\n\n03:15.080 --> 03:18.080\nI mean, I'm still American.\n\n03:18.080 --> 03:22.080\nI think, I don't know, I still value America.\n\n03:22.080 --> 03:25.080\nI'm a capitalist for God's sakes.\n\n03:25.080 --> 03:27.080\nI don't want to socialize medicine.\n\n03:27.080 --> 03:31.080\nIf you get sick, you should have to pay for your medical care.\n\n03:31.080 --> 03:35.080\nAnd slaves should be free.\n\n03:35.080 --> 03:40.080\nI think the only reason Teddy Roosevelt's on the monument is because he was a friend\n\n03:40.080 --> 03:41.080\nof the sculptor, right?\n\n03:41.080 --> 03:43.080\nThat was kind of an inside joke.\n\n03:43.080 --> 03:46.080\nNo, that's probably what Cobra's big problem with.\n\n03:46.080 --> 03:49.080\nLet's get this fucking Teddy Roosevelt off of here.\n\n03:49.080 --> 03:51.080\nHe didn't earn this.\n\n03:51.080 --> 03:53.080\nI did.\n\n03:53.080 --> 03:57.080\nBy having a smooth face.\n\n03:57.080 --> 04:03.080\nBut yeah, the world seemed, that was the elephant in the room.\n\n04:03.080 --> 04:08.080\nGI Joe were terrorists because they were in a world where Cobra was the establishment.\n\n04:08.080 --> 04:11.080\nBut pretty much the same behavior occurring.\n\n04:11.080 --> 04:14.080\nJust people shooting at each other with lasers.\n\n04:14.080 --> 04:19.080\nAll right, so there's a new thing for the moon colony.\n\n04:19.080 --> 04:22.080\nAll right.\n\n04:22.080 --> 04:27.080\nI love that we've returned to our premise after all these years.\n\n04:27.080 --> 04:34.080\nOkay, we don't, the jury's still out on whether or not there will be restaurants on the moon.\n\n04:34.080 --> 04:36.080\nThere has to be restaurants.\n\n04:36.080 --> 04:39.080\nOne for Jeff, VIP moon.\n\n04:39.080 --> 04:42.080\nVIP moon is going to have great restaurants.\n\n04:42.080 --> 04:51.080\nActually, I was thinking about making the moon a second to a friend and my little VIP moon is just going to be a taco truck.\n\n04:51.080 --> 04:56.080\nHere is, because I cannot enact this legislation on the earth, that's the only reason I'm bringing up the moon.\n\n04:56.080 --> 05:00.080\nBecause I have no control over what goes down here.\n\n05:00.080 --> 05:05.080\nBut I would like to make this suggestion to the wait staff of America.\n\n05:05.080 --> 05:10.080\nI think that when you come up to the table, and it's time to clear the plates away.\n\n05:10.080 --> 05:18.080\nAnd when you see that a plate has been cleared by the diner, like lift clean.\n\n05:18.080 --> 05:26.080\nI know that the overwhelming temptation that you've learned this from other waiters and then learned it from your behavior at the table.\n\n05:26.080 --> 05:31.080\nI know that you want to do the hilarious looks like you didn't like it bit.\n\n05:31.080 --> 05:33.080\nLooks like you hated it.\n\n05:33.080 --> 05:35.080\nLooks like you hated it.\n\n05:35.080 --> 05:38.080\nI think we have to stop it.\n\n05:38.080 --> 05:44.080\nIt's a cancerous joke.\n\n05:44.080 --> 05:51.080\nIt takes in joy and it creates discomfort.\n\n05:51.080 --> 05:59.080\nYou think you're misperceiving people's nervous chuckles as joy.\n\n05:59.080 --> 06:04.080\nYou might as well just go up to people and go, whoa, do you hate me or something?\n\n06:04.080 --> 06:07.080\nAnd make them go, no.\n\n06:07.080 --> 06:11.080\nThat sound, that's not happiness, that sound.\n\n06:11.080 --> 06:14.080\nThat's like, oh God, Jesus Christ, this person's making me uncomfortable.\n\n06:14.080 --> 06:17.080\nIt's just sort of like, what do you want?\n\n06:17.080 --> 06:19.080\nJust go away.\n\n06:19.080 --> 06:21.080\nIt looks like you didn't like your food.\n\n06:21.080 --> 06:27.080\nNo, I did. That's why I ate all the food.\n\n06:27.080 --> 06:29.080\nI did like it. I liked it so much.\n\n06:29.080 --> 06:31.080\nI opposite hated it.\n\n06:31.080 --> 06:33.080\nThat's why you said that.\n\n06:33.080 --> 06:35.080\nHere's your money.\n\n06:35.080 --> 06:42.080\nThe worst case scenario is it makes you feel fat, like the person you're talking to.\n\n06:42.080 --> 06:50.080\nThe best case scenario is just kind of just nervousness, just confusion and anxiety.\n\n06:50.080 --> 06:56.080\nSo stop it if you can down here, but on earth on the moon that will not be allowed.\n\n06:56.080 --> 06:58.080\nAnd that may be the reason why there cannot be restaurants.\n\n06:58.080 --> 07:01.080\nThat and close-up magic.\n\n07:01.080 --> 07:04.080\nNo fucking close-up magic.\n\n07:04.080 --> 07:08.080\nYeah, well restaurants bring a lot of society's pains.\n\n07:08.080 --> 07:11.080\nIf you eliminate restaurants, there's not going to be close-up magicians.\n\n07:11.080 --> 07:14.080\nI don't like magic. We've talked about this a number of times.\n\n07:14.080 --> 07:16.080\nFuck magicians.\n\n07:16.080 --> 07:19.080\nBut magic is lies.\n\n07:19.080 --> 07:21.080\nIt's just somebody lying to you.\n\n07:21.080 --> 07:22.080\nIt's not a trick.\n\n07:22.080 --> 07:24.080\nA magic trick is just a lie.\n\n07:24.080 --> 07:29.080\nAnd when magicians, I'm sure I'm repeating myself, but when a magician goes,\n\n07:29.080 --> 07:33.080\nif someone does a card trick, I go, wow, how'd you do that?\n\n07:33.080 --> 07:35.080\nCan't tell you, man.\n\n07:35.080 --> 07:38.080\nCan't tell you because that's part of the magician's code.\n\n07:38.080 --> 07:42.080\nThe reason why they can't tell you is because if they told you, you're a magician.\n\n07:42.080 --> 07:46.080\nWe'd all be magicians if you knew the fucking stupid fucking trick.\n\n07:46.080 --> 07:51.080\nAnd you'd have to wear a vest and stink and be named Dave.\n\n07:51.080 --> 07:53.080\nI don't know.\n\n07:53.080 --> 07:57.080\nI'm thinking of one guy.\n\n07:57.080 --> 08:01.080\nHowever, I went to the fucking magic castle against my will\n\n08:01.080 --> 08:04.080\nand against all fucking better judgment because the magic castle, as I said before,\n\n08:04.080 --> 08:07.080\nis a bummer and it smells like poo.\n\n08:07.080 --> 08:12.080\nBut I went there and I was brought up on stage by the, it wasn't the close-up stage,\n\n08:12.080 --> 08:14.080\nit was like the medium-sized stage.\n\n08:14.080 --> 08:17.080\nAnd the guy saw me in my suit and goes, you.\n\n08:17.080 --> 08:18.080\nDid I talk about this on the show already?\n\n08:18.080 --> 08:19.080\nYeah.\n\n08:19.080 --> 08:20.080\nI did?\n\n08:20.080 --> 08:22.080\nAll right, go fuck yourself.\n\n08:22.080 --> 08:25.080\nYeah, he brought me up on stage because he thought I would be skeptical.\n\n08:25.080 --> 08:27.080\nAnd he proceeded to blow my mind.\n\n08:27.080 --> 08:31.080\nHe needed me up on stage to prove to the audience that like fucking, like it was really magical.\n\n08:31.080 --> 08:33.080\nYou mean you had to like cut a rope or?\n\n08:33.080 --> 08:35.080\nNo, he dropped coins.\n\n08:35.080 --> 08:38.080\nHe kept dropping metal coins into my hand and then when he would close my hand,\n\n08:38.080 --> 08:41.080\nand I would see like one, two, three, four coins go into my hand,\n\n08:41.080 --> 08:44.080\nbig loud metal coins would close my fists.\n\n08:44.080 --> 08:47.080\nAnd he would say, how many coins are in your hands?\n\n08:47.080 --> 08:49.080\nIn front of 45 people.\n\n08:49.080 --> 08:54.080\nAnd I would say, well, four. And he opened my hand and there would be a rubber ball in my hand.\n\n08:54.080 --> 08:57.080\nAnd it was fucking magic.\n\n08:57.080 --> 08:59.080\nSo I take everything back.\n\n08:59.080 --> 09:01.080\nSo you like, all right, all right.\n\n09:01.080 --> 09:04.080\nIt has to be real magic otherwise.\n\n09:04.080 --> 09:06.080\nIt has to be real.\n\n09:06.080 --> 09:08.080\nIt's still fucking.\n\n09:08.080 --> 09:10.080\nAnd also he smelled like mildew.\n\n09:10.080 --> 09:13.080\nIt smells like a grandpa sleeping bag there.\n\n09:13.080 --> 09:16.080\nThe one that died in his sleeping bag.\n\n09:16.080 --> 09:19.080\nHow about the magic trick of make the smell disappear?\n\n09:19.080 --> 09:21.080\nYeah, that would be quite a trick.\n\n09:21.080 --> 09:23.080\nFuck the ghost at the piano.\n\n09:23.080 --> 09:26.080\nTake a magic bath, people.\n\n09:26.080 --> 09:31.080\nI stopped myself halfway through that because I'm, what have I become?\n\n09:31.080 --> 09:34.080\nYeah, you're the guy that hates being told to take a bath.\n\n09:34.080 --> 09:36.080\nA magic castle should be my people.\n\n09:36.080 --> 09:40.080\nIf I knew how to lie better, I should just be there instead of the moon.\n\n09:40.080 --> 09:45.080\nI should be just saying abracadabra and hanging out in my dumb hat.\n\n09:45.080 --> 09:53.080\nYou ever get scared bagging on magicians that, you know, you'll come home\n\n09:53.080 --> 09:56.080\nand your bed will be just about half.\n\n09:56.080 --> 10:00.080\nI live in mortal fear of that.\n\n10:00.080 --> 10:05.080\nDoes anybody really like magic?\n\n10:05.080 --> 10:10.080\nI mean, you just said yourself, I mean, you described an experience that was well done.\n\n10:10.080 --> 10:12.080\nBut I wasn't, I didn't have fun.\n\n10:12.080 --> 10:15.080\nI was like, oh, you're faking me out.\n\n10:15.080 --> 10:17.080\nYou're doing like, like it's just lies.\n\n10:17.080 --> 10:21.080\nI get very nervous in regular conversations, let alone conversations where I'm being asked questions,\n\n10:21.080 --> 10:25.080\ntold what to do, afraid I'm going to do it wrong.\n\n10:25.080 --> 10:32.080\nLike my, my, the few times that I've been engaged by a magician have caused me such, such anxiety\n\n10:32.080 --> 10:38.080\nthat I think I exude like a force field that magicians don't pick me and stuff.\n\n10:38.080 --> 10:44.080\nBecause I just get so nervous in those things when people go like, oh, put this in your hand.\n\n10:44.080 --> 10:49.080\nOh, the other left hand.\n\n10:49.080 --> 10:53.080\nI'm surprised that somebody actually, a recent waiter, a waitress, gave you the,\n\n10:53.080 --> 10:56.080\nlooks like you didn't like it bit.\n\n10:56.080 --> 10:58.080\nThat was, that was this weekend that happened.\n\n10:58.080 --> 11:01.080\nThe guy at Umami Burger, a hipster burger place in Hollywood.\n\n11:01.080 --> 11:09.080\nBut still his, his mustache was waxed, he was wearing a, you know, half a strap of an overall,\n\n11:09.080 --> 11:14.080\nwhatever the fuck the kids are doing these days, a henna tattoo of Pokemon on his face.\n\n11:14.080 --> 11:16.080\nI don't know, whatever.\n\n11:16.080 --> 11:18.080\nHe was a hologram.\n\n11:18.080 --> 11:25.080\nHe, he, he, but still saw, saw the crumbs and just like the 45 year old midwestern diner waitress in him\n\n11:25.080 --> 11:27.080\njust jumped out.\n\n11:27.080 --> 11:32.080\nYeah.\n\n11:32.080 --> 11:34.080\nNo, I did.\n\n11:34.080 --> 11:35.080\nI swear.\n\n11:35.080 --> 11:39.080\nWhy are we fighting?\n\n11:39.080 --> 11:44.080\nWhat is the instinct to be sarcastic in a moment that should just be celebrated?\n\n11:44.080 --> 11:45.080\nOh, wow.\n\n11:45.080 --> 11:46.080\nYou loved the mac and cheese.\n\n11:46.080 --> 11:47.080\nIt's gone.\n\n11:47.080 --> 11:50.080\nIt's in your, it's in your boo boo's.\n\n11:50.080 --> 11:52.080\nGood boy.\n\n11:52.080 --> 11:54.080\nClean plate club.\n\n11:54.080 --> 11:56.080\nJust, just be nice in that moment.\n\n11:56.080 --> 11:58.080\nYou don't have to be Willy Wonka.\n\n11:58.080 --> 12:01.080\nYou don't have to fucking stretch my boundaries.\n\n12:01.080 --> 12:04.080\nTeach me that truth is relative.\n\n12:04.080 --> 12:10.080\nYou're not a fucking like, you're not, you're not, you're not a, you're not Mad Bartigan.\n\n12:10.080 --> 12:13.080\nI don't know what I was going to say.\n\n12:13.080 --> 12:15.080\nAre you comparing him to Willow?\n\n12:15.080 --> 12:17.080\nI don't know why that name leapt into my head.\n\n12:17.080 --> 12:18.080\nOh, because I miss Erin.\n\n12:18.080 --> 12:20.080\nThat's why she's in Chicago.\n\n12:20.080 --> 12:21.080\nYeah.\n\n12:21.080 --> 12:22.080\nThanks guys.\n\n12:22.080 --> 12:25.080\nThat was, that was heartfelt.\n\n12:25.080 --> 12:28.080\nShe's in Chicago doing like these shows and stuff.\n\n12:28.080 --> 12:30.080\nAnd it's like two days without her.\n\n12:30.080 --> 12:31.080\nI'm just a wreck.\n\n12:31.080 --> 12:32.080\nWhy is that?\n\n12:32.080 --> 12:37.080\nI just, I guess either, the healthiest answer because I love her.\n\n12:37.080 --> 12:41.080\nIf I'm unhealthy, I'm an emotional vampire and I was feeding off of her.\n\n12:41.080 --> 12:42.080\nI don't know.\n\n12:42.080 --> 12:46.080\nIn either case, she was, she was integral to my, to my happiness.\n\n12:46.080 --> 12:49.080\nYou guys, are you guys going to get married?\n\n12:49.080 --> 12:53.080\nWell, you know, I don't know if you understand how marriage works, but typically you're not\n\n12:53.080 --> 12:56.080\nsupposed to give that much of a heads up.\n\n12:56.080 --> 13:02.080\nLike, if I said yes, then, and then when I, when I, when I proposed to her, she's going\n\n13:02.080 --> 13:06.080\nto say finally instead of yes.\n\n13:06.080 --> 13:10.080\nYou're being extra weird about it for no reason.\n\n13:10.080 --> 13:12.080\nYou guys haven't discussed this?\n\n13:12.080 --> 13:14.080\nIt's not, it's not a discussion that you guys have had?\n\n13:14.080 --> 13:17.080\nI think there's a lot, well, I think she knows that I want to be with her forever and stuff,\n\n13:17.080 --> 13:22.080\nbut you know, you, you know that there's a, there's a, there's a, it's, it's, it's\n\n13:22.080 --> 13:27.080\nit's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, there's a tackiness to, you know, pointing\n\n13:27.080 --> 13:28.080\nat the bleachers.\n\n13:28.080 --> 13:32.080\nWhy don't you, why don't you be the first person to propose to her on a podcast that\n\n13:32.080 --> 13:36.080\nwill come out two days from now?\n\n13:36.080 --> 13:37.080\nBecause that.\n\n13:37.080 --> 13:42.080\nAnd you can like, like, like put a ring on her iPhone and like, I don't know.\n\n13:42.080 --> 13:44.080\nBecause that, that will be her moment.\n\n13:44.080 --> 13:49.080\nI don't want to, I don't want to be one of those guys that embarrasses the, the, the,\n\n13:49.080 --> 13:54.080\nthe, the, the, the, the proposal, you know, I want to, I want to do it regular style\n\n13:54.080 --> 13:56.080\nand see, you're going to do it.\n\n13:56.080 --> 14:07.080\nWell, I, I, I, I have no plans to, to, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,\n\n14:07.080 --> 14:12.080\nI'm not breaking up with her and, and I'm not dying.\n\n14:12.080 --> 14:15.080\nErgo, marriage is imminent.\n\n14:15.080 --> 14:17.080\nErgo, will you marry me?\n\n14:17.080 --> 14:21.080\nIt's, it's, it's, it's, it's just, isn't there some magic to this idea?\n\n14:21.080 --> 14:22.080\nHey, hey, sorry you brought it up.\n\n14:22.080 --> 14:24.080\nI'm sorry you brought it up.\n\n14:24.080 --> 14:26.080\nYou don't have to marry her.\n\n14:26.080 --> 14:28.080\nNo, no one's making you marry her.\n\n14:28.080 --> 14:31.080\nIf I, if I asked you if you were going to marry your girlfriend, you know that the,\n\n14:31.080 --> 14:34.080\nyou know what that would, the spot that you would be put on.\n\n14:34.080 --> 14:38.080\nYou'd have to, that's a yes or no question to something that you're not supposed to\n\n14:38.080 --> 14:39.080\ntalk about that stuff.\n\n14:39.080 --> 14:40.080\nWhy not?\n\n14:40.080 --> 14:41.080\nAll right.\n\n14:41.080 --> 14:43.080\nJeff, are you going to marry the girlfriend that you're with right now?\n\n14:43.080 --> 14:44.080\nNo.\n\n14:44.080 --> 14:56.080\nAre you?\n\n14:56.080 --> 15:08.080\nYes.\n\n15:08.080 --> 15:13.080\nAlthough this, I made that decision before I found out yours was going to be available.\n\n15:13.080 --> 15:20.080\nShe's a delight.\n\n15:20.080 --> 15:22.080\nAll right.\n\n15:22.080 --> 15:23.080\nYes.\n\n15:23.080 --> 15:24.080\nYes.\n\n15:24.080 --> 15:25.080\nI miss Erin.\n\n15:25.080 --> 15:26.080\nYes.\n\n15:26.080 --> 15:27.080\nOne day.\n\n15:27.080 --> 15:28.080\nYes.\n\n15:28.080 --> 15:29.080\nI'll make an honest woman out of her.\n\n15:29.080 --> 15:32.080\nShe's a, where's that, where's that expression come from?\n\n15:32.080 --> 15:37.080\nWell, I guess I, I guess I, I guess I just like the idea that you're making a woman dishonest\n\n15:37.080 --> 15:44.080\nlike just like, I guess that hails back to a time when, when sex was a criminal act,\n\n15:44.080 --> 15:45.080\nlike out of wedlock.\n\n15:45.080 --> 15:49.080\nLike you had to, if you were having sex with somebody and they weren't married to them,\n\n15:49.080 --> 15:53.080\nthey had to lie to the gas station attendant.\n\n15:53.080 --> 15:59.080\nWhere would you, I'm sure Erin's, I know Erin enough to know she's the kind of person that\n\n15:59.080 --> 16:01.080\nprobably has ideas about what her ideal wedding would be.\n\n16:01.080 --> 16:04.080\nBut if you, like, like, where would you like to be married?\n\n16:04.080 --> 16:07.080\nLike in like the best of all possible worlds?\n\n16:07.080 --> 16:12.080\nI, I, I, I would start that conversation by acknowledging that I think the ceremonies\n\n16:12.080 --> 16:16.080\nare more for the, for the people, you know, like, because you could take somebody and\n\n16:16.080 --> 16:19.080\nstand under a waterfall and, or go to city hall.\n\n16:19.080 --> 16:21.080\nI think Kumail and Emily went to city hall, didn't they?\n\n16:21.080 --> 16:24.080\nBut maybe they had a ceremony later for friends.\n\n16:24.080 --> 16:30.080\nBut, but, but like the couple, you know, there's a, marrying somebody would make a,\n\n16:30.080 --> 16:35.080\na warehouse full of dead rats, a romantic for those two people.\n\n16:35.080 --> 16:39.080\nBut for the people that you're inviting, you want to make sure that they're having a good time.\n\n16:39.080 --> 16:45.080\nAnd to that effect, I would like to do a Raiders and the Lost Ark themed wedding where,\n\n16:45.080 --> 16:54.080\nwhere the audience was, was not only allowed to, but really required to help save our marriage from\n\n16:54.080 --> 16:57.080\nuh, Destro, I don't know.\n\n16:57.080 --> 17:01.080\nAre you two going to be tied to a stake in the, and when they, when the ring comes out,\n\n17:01.080 --> 17:03.080\nyou're going to say, don't look at it.\n\n17:03.080 --> 17:04.080\nYeah, yeah.\n\n17:04.080 --> 17:05.080\nYeah.\n\n17:05.080 --> 17:08.080\nThe, the, the officiant will be a melting Nazi.\n\n17:08.080 --> 17:14.080\nWell, also a, a, a ceremonial garb and he'll, he'll, he'll open up.\n\n17:14.080 --> 17:16.080\nWe'll get married by bella.\n\n17:16.080 --> 17:20.080\nWell, all of the attendees have to dress like Nazis too.\n\n17:20.080 --> 17:25.080\nI think that was a Nazi heavy ceremony in Raiders and the Lost Ark.\n\n17:25.080 --> 17:26.080\nWhat are you doing?\n\n17:26.080 --> 17:29.080\nAaron's texting me.\n\n17:29.080 --> 17:33.080\nIt's like she knows the show is going on.\n\n17:33.080 --> 17:35.080\nWhy did she, why did she text me?\n\n17:35.080 --> 17:36.080\nRead it!\n\n17:36.080 --> 17:38.080\nNo, because it...\n\n17:38.080 --> 17:42.080\nShe said yes?\n\n17:42.080 --> 17:46.080\nThat, that means Adam Goldberg is texting her.\n\n17:46.080 --> 17:49.080\nAnd she's saying I do right now.\n\n17:49.080 --> 17:54.080\nNo, no, she doesn't, she, she's just, uh, wait, she's, I don't know, she's at, I think she's at,\n\n17:54.080 --> 17:58.080\nshe's at some hip hop show and then she says, she sent me all texts, all caps.\n\n17:58.080 --> 18:01.080\nAh, an MC just dropped your name.\n\n18:01.080 --> 18:05.080\nAh, ah.\n\n18:05.080 --> 18:08.080\nAnd then, and then a follow up text in reference to community.\n\n18:08.080 --> 18:13.080\nAh, like it would be in reference to my world famous carrot cake recipe.\n\n18:13.080 --> 18:15.080\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo, before we get started.\n\n18:15.080 --> 18:18.080\nI want to give a big shout out to Dan Harmon.\n\n18:18.080 --> 18:22.080\nHe puts the right amount of cinnamon in that carrot cake.\n\n18:22.080 --> 18:24.080\nHe's out there keeping it real.\n\n18:24.080 --> 18:27.080\nNot too much carrot.\n\n18:27.080 --> 18:29.080\nI assume is the secret.\n\n18:29.080 --> 18:34.080\nIt's a cake, not a salad.\n\n18:34.080 --> 18:38.080\nDid you know that, uh, Harmontown is a Feral Audio podcast, Jeff?\n\n18:38.080 --> 18:40.080\nI wasn't familiar with that concept.\n\n18:40.080 --> 18:43.080\nAnd

He's on PCP.\n\n24:23.080 --> 24:25.080\nIs that dust? Is that angel dust?\n\n24:25.080 --> 24:26.080\nAngel dust.\n\n24:26.080 --> 24:28.080\nIs that what angel dust is?\n\n24:28.080 --> 24:29.080\nYeah.\n\n24:29.080 --> 24:30.080\nPCP?

a...\n\n24:38.080 --> 24:41.080\nPCP is the only time, I've seen people on PCP\n\n24:41.080 --> 24:45.080\nand it is a intense like,\n\n24:45.080 --> 24:47.080\nI'm not sure the original purpose,\n\n24:47.080 --> 24:49.080\nI think it was like a horse tranquilizer or some crazy shit.\n\n24:49.080 --> 24:52.080\nAnd friends of mine accidentally have done it\n\n24:52.080 --> 24:55.080\nand I've seen them and they thought they could do anything\n\n24:55.080 --> 24:57.080\nand they really just go berserk.\n\n24:57.080 --> 25:01.080\nAnd like, you really do think you could punch your fist through a wall\n\n25:01.080 --> 25:02.080\nso you try it.\n\n25:02.080 --> 25:04.080\nAnd then there was that bath salts thing\n\n25:04.080 --> 25:07.080\nthat made you think that you would like to eat a face.\n\n25:07.080 --> 25:08.080\nWhat?\n\n25:08.080 --> 25:09.080\nYeah.\n\n25:09.080 --> 25:10.080\nYou don't even know.\n\n25:10.080 --> 25:11.080\nBath salts.\n\n25:11.080 --> 25:15.080\nFor a little while there, there was a spate of human,\n\n25:15.080 --> 25:20.080\nunhuman murder cannibalism happening on this drug.\n\n25:20.080 --> 25:26.080\nI thought it was actually people snorting the product called bath salts,\n\n25:26.080 --> 25:29.080\nlike the actual bath salts that someone had figured out\n\n25:29.080 --> 25:32.080\nthat you could snort that and get high\n\n25:32.080 --> 25:34.080\nbut it was also making you eat faces.\n\n25:34.080 --> 25:37.080\nBut I think it's, isn't it just a drug you kids are taking?\n\n25:37.080 --> 25:40.080\nWhat is the active ingredient in the bath salts?\n\n25:40.080 --> 25:47.080\nIt's basically, it's chemically equal to something like a illegal substance\n\n25:47.080 --> 25:50.080\nbut they basically use different ingredients and methods to get around it\n\n25:50.080 --> 25:53.080\nso they were selling basically what a good one to like,\n\n25:53.080 --> 25:57.080\nsomething like a PCB in legal form and packets and stores.\n\n25:57.080 --> 25:59.080\nIt's basically meth.\n\n25:59.080 --> 26:00.080\nYeah, it's meth.\n\n26:00.080 --> 26:01.080\nIt's meth.\n\n26:01.080 --> 26:03.080\nAnd you take a bath in it?\n\n26:03.080 --> 26:05.080\nYou smell good.\n\n26:05.080 --> 26:06.080\nOh, okay.\n\n26:06.080 --> 26:09.080\nBut there's a special ingredient, human face.\n\n26:09.080 --> 26:13.080\nOnce you get a taste for it, you...\n\n26:13.080 --> 26:17.080\nIs somebody else talking out there?\n\n26:17.080 --> 26:21.080\nDid somebody just take a phone call or was somebody like loaded with information about bath salts?\n\n26:21.080 --> 26:24.080\nBecause if you are, you could tell us.\n\n26:24.080 --> 26:27.080\nAll right, well enough about, we talked about drugs.\n\n26:27.080 --> 26:30.080\nWe talked about Cobra Commander.\n\n26:30.080 --> 26:32.080\nWe talked about rock and roll.\n\n26:32.080 --> 26:34.080\nWhy don't we bring Spencer up?\n\n26:34.080 --> 26:44.080\nFuck yeah, why not?\n\n26:44.080 --> 26:46.080\nHello, Spencer.\n\n26:46.080 --> 26:48.080\nHey, hey, hey.\n\n26:48.080 --> 26:53.080\nSpencer, is it just me or is your beard becoming more and more majestic as time goes by?\n\n26:53.080 --> 27:03.080\nLong time fans may know that my beard increases in length every time I get more Twitter followers.\n\n27:03.080 --> 27:05.080\nBut having a beard's weird.\n\n27:05.080 --> 27:07.080\nDo you like having a beard, Dan?\n\n27:07.080 --> 27:10.080\nOnly if I'm able to keep it clean.\n\n27:10.080 --> 27:12.080\nYeah, otherwise it gets very itchy.\n\n27:12.080 --> 27:23.080\nI find that people take, I mean, having a beard is a lot like having like a comment section on your face.\n\n27:23.080 --> 27:25.080\nPeople just feel free to say anything.\n\n27:25.080 --> 27:27.080\nThey're like, oh man, how long have you been growing that?\n\n27:27.080 --> 27:28.080\nI mean, that's fine.\n\n27:28.080 --> 27:34.080\nThey're like, oh, when are you planning on cutting that or this old guy's like, oh, give you $50 to cut that right now?\n\n27:34.080 --> 27:36.080\nOr someone's like, fuck you.\n\n27:36.080 --> 27:39.080\nYeah, yeah.\n\n27:39.080 --> 27:43.080\nYeah, it's kind of unwarranted because it's not like you did anything special.\n\n27:43.080 --> 27:45.080\nYou really just let it grow.\n\n27:45.080 --> 27:47.080\nI did less than everybody else.\n\n27:47.080 --> 27:51.080\nMy question is, but there's no answer to this except biology.\n\n27:51.080 --> 27:53.080\nLike, how do you get it to be so long?\n\n27:53.080 --> 27:55.080\nI don't think I'm capable of doing that.\n\n27:55.080 --> 28:01.080\nYeah, well, what was that moving was in the movie knocked up where they make in front of a guy for growing a beard?\n\n28:01.080 --> 28:02.080\nCan't remember.\n\n28:02.080 --> 28:03.080\nYeah, it's like that.\n\n28:03.080 --> 28:05.080\nLike there's this there's this phase.\n\n28:05.080 --> 28:06.080\nIt's terrible.\n\n28:06.080 --> 28:10.080\nIt's like, I think it's just long enough so it curls back and is stabbing into your face.\n\n28:10.080 --> 28:11.080\nAnd that's what makes it all itchy.\n\n28:11.080 --> 28:17.080\nBut once you get past that, it kind of just bursts forth in majesty.\n\n28:17.080 --> 28:22.080\nDo you really think that if I just never trimmed my beard that it would ever have get acquired length like that?\n\n28:22.080 --> 28:32.080\nYeah, when I was in like middle school and high school and stuff, people would tell me that I missed some spots shaving when I just didn't shave because it only came in like two spots on my face.\n\n28:32.080 --> 28:37.080\nBut eventually you just if you don't shave it, it'll start filling out and stuff.\n\n28:37.080 --> 28:40.080\nI think it's just that everything grows at a different rate.\n\n28:40.080 --> 28:42.080\nSo if you're shaving your whole face, it'll only be patchy.\n\n28:42.080 --> 28:44.080\nBut if you let it grow long enough, you know.\n\n28:44.080 --> 28:46.080\nDan, do you not trim your beard?\n\n28:46.080 --> 28:47.080\nYou don't curtail that?\n\n28:47.080 --> 28:49.080\nIt stops at that length?\n\n28:49.080 --> 29:01.080\nI usually end up trimming it, but I feel like if I didn't, when I don't trim it, all that happens is it just sort of like, as I've said, it just kind of Galifianacus is like, it just kind of gets bushier.\n\n29:01.080 --> 29:07.080\nBut it doesn't really take on this cascading, beautiful waterfall of manhood.\n\n29:07.080 --> 29:12.080\nI don't know. I think the bushy look is a lot better. This just looks really weird.\n\n29:12.080 --> 29:26.080\nWell, I'm just saying, I don't know if everyone automatically has the ability to like, zeezy top it. I think some of us would just, I would just look more and more like, there was a donut of hair around my head.\n\n29:26.080 --> 29:32.080\nI would just end up being like this weird Dick Tracy character. Donut head.\n\n29:32.080 --> 29:36.080\nI'm taking Dick Tracy out of the headlines. I'm rubbing him out.\n\n29:36.080 --> 29:40.080\nEasy donut head. Just keep playing poker.\n\n29:40.080 --> 29:47.080\nHey, little face. Yeah, donut head. What's the difference between us?\n\n29:47.080 --> 29:57.080\nI have a tiny face surrounded by a head. Do you have a regular head surrounded by a bunch of hair? Why am I explaining this to you?\n\n29:57.080 --> 30:01.080\nBecause I'm donut head. I'm not too bright.\n\n30:01.080 --> 30:10.080\nYou got involved in organized crime? Not because it was my passion. It was because I had no other options. I lacked the aptitude for other occupations.\n\n30:10.080 --> 30:17.080\nAh, come on donut head. Don't be so hard on yourself. You get the tiny little face. You're born to be a gangster.\n\n30:17.080 --> 30:23.080\nYou being sarcastic? No. I pick up on that shit, you see.\n\n30:23.080 --> 30:34.080\nWell, let's get Dick Tracy. Alright, little face. Later.\n\n30:34.080 --> 30:39.080\nWhy do you keep your bread in the freezer? What are you doing in my apartment?\n\n30:39.080 --> 30:44.080\nWho keeps bread in the freezer? You want a sandwich? Now you go to the freezer and the bread's fucking frozen.\n\n30:44.080 --> 30:47.080\nWhat are you gonna... You know you need a sandwich? A half hour before?\n\n30:47.080 --> 30:54.080\nWhat, meanwhile? I want my face to be more to the left.\n\n30:54.080 --> 30:59.080\nOh, but to call the commander, they want to replace him as the Roosevelt.\n\n30:59.080 --> 31:06.080\nI don't care. I heard he didn't even do anything to be on this mountain. Also, G.I. Joe's terrible. I hate them.\n\n31:06.080 --> 31:10.080\nLater.\n\n31:10.080 --> 31:23.080\nStacy, move those shoes. You found the bottom of my improv hopper.\n\n31:23.080 --> 31:33.080\nI wanted that to go on for the rest of my life. I wanted to just keep saying, meanwhile and later, that would go on forever.\n\n31:33.080 --> 31:45.080\nI had to go, I got bad pretty quick, didn't it? Didn't even start that good. Just looking at my Evernote, back to Evernote.\n\n31:45.080 --> 31:51.080\nAlright, I let the waiters have it, right? Just don't do that.\n\n31:51.080 --> 31:56.080\nWhat do you mean, why not? Who said that? Are you a waitress?\n\n31:56.080 --> 32:04.080\nCome up on stage and get a microphone.\n\n32:04.080 --> 32:09.080\nAlright, can we re-pipe some of that now that maybe we'll edit out the... So you are a wait person.\n\n32:09.080 --> 32:10.080\nI was.\n\n32:10.080 --> 32:15.080\nWho has taken the stage. You were a wait person for seven years, did you say?\n\n32:15.080 --> 32:22.080\nI had six years from numerous restaurants around the LA County that have no need for me, so there you go.\n\n32:22.080 --> 32:28.080\nOkay, and what you were saying is that you learned from wait people.\n\n32:28.080 --> 32:37.080\nYeah, well, it's like, okay, you finish your pie, I'm like, oh, you look like you really like it there, right? That's what they say, you know.\n\n32:37.080 --> 32:39.080\nWell, no, they say it looks like you hated it.\n\n32:39.080 --> 32:43.080\nRight, whatever. Well, what you said, you know what I mean, I'm sorry.\n\n32:43.080 --> 32:48.080\nWell, I mean, but what you said, I want to point out is actually kind of a, I mean, that wouldn't be half as bad.\n\n32:48.080 --> 32:50.080\nYeah, I would say, you really liked it.\n\n32:50.080 --> 32:52.080\nWell, yeah, thank you.\n\n32:52.080 --> 32:59.080\nBut I'm saying I've worked with people that have said that, and I, as a waitress, when I've gone out to eat, they've told me that, oh, it looks like you hated it.\n\n32:59.080 --> 33:01.080\nAnd you don't like that, do you?\n\n33:01.080 --> 33:08.080\nAnd I didn't like it, but I've had friends that have been with me while it's been said to me that, and here's what you do.\n\n33:08.080 --> 33:11.080\nThe next time they tell you that, you say, yeah, it sucked.\n\n33:11.080 --> 33:15.080\nYou say that, you say that, and then they're kind of confused.\n\n33:15.080 --> 33:20.080\nBut if you, like, for example, if you, why'd you eat it, if it sucked, why'd you eat it all?\n\n33:20.080 --> 33:27.080\nAnd you're like, you could say, well, because I couldn't order anything else, because you were too lazy to come back from me to change my order.\n\n33:27.080 --> 33:31.080\nAnd I swear to God, that will make them feel worse, because the biggest servers don't.\n\n33:31.080 --> 33:38.080\nSo in telling them you murdered their parents, I mean, it comes to a certain point where it's just like, what is our goal here as a society?\n\n33:38.080 --> 33:42.080\nIs it just to poison each other's brains and souls?\n\n33:42.080 --> 33:49.080\nYes. No, I'm just saying, if you want to make them feel bad, because they've been, they've told me that before.\n\n33:49.080 --> 33:53.080\nWell, okay, here's the thing, I used to work at Johnny Rockets and Johnny Rockets has Apple Pie.\n\n33:53.080 --> 33:58.080\nThey have Apple Pie with cheddar cheese on it. I don't recommend it. You should go to Pans is better.\n\n33:58.080 --> 34:04.080\nAnyway, you, you ordered that and some people would be like, well, yeah, the pie was too burnt.\n\n34:04.080 --> 34:07.080\nAnd I'm like, well, why'd you, why'd you finish it? And they're like, well, because I was hungry.\n\n34:07.080 --> 34:13.080\nAnd then they still, what's even tacky is when they asked for a refund on something that they ate in completion.\n\n34:13.080 --> 34:19.080\nBut you know, if you want to make them feel bad, ask for a refund. You don't necessarily have to get it, but you'll definitely put the server in their place.\n\n34:19.080 --> 34:20.080\nAll right, well, I'm just saying.\n\n34:20.080 --> 34:24.080\nLisette, did you work at one of the Johnny Rockets where you had to like get up on the counter and sing and dance?\n\n34:24.080 --> 34:25.080\nThat's Ed DeBellas.\n\n34:25.080 --> 34:26.080\nYes, it was.\n\n34:26.080 --> 34:30.080\nThere are Johnny Rockets. If they play YMCA, you have to get up and do it.\n\n34:30.080 --> 34:32.080\nOr Respect by, yeah, by Rita Franklin.\n\n34:32.080 --> 34:33.080\nDid you have to do that?\n\n34:33.080 --> 34:36.080\nOh, it was very, it wasn't my better day.\n\n34:36.080 --> 34:37.080\nCan we see a little version of it?\n\n34:37.080 --> 34:39.080\nNo, thank you. No, no.\n\n34:39.080 --> 34:42.080\nShe just said it was horrible.\n\n34:42.080 --> 34:46.080\nShe's comfortable telling, making people feel worse about things.\n\n34:46.080 --> 34:50.080\nNo, I'm just saying, I've been a server and I've, you know...\n\n34:50.080 --> 34:52.080\nWhat you want?\n\n34:54.080 --> 34:58.080\nIs that like the sound of an alarm clock in a movie or are you going like...\n\n34:58.080 --> 35:02.080\nI still like that song regardless that I had to dance to it, but I'm just saying, yeah.\n\n35:02.080 --> 35:06.080\nIt's not that I'm trying to make a server feel bad. I'm just saying, there's two kinds of servers.\n\n35:06.080 --> 35:09.080\nThey're dicks and then they're nice people. They're nice people.\n\n35:09.080 --> 35:11.080\nYeah, basically.\n\n35:11.080 --> 35:14.080\nDicks and knife people. I was like, holy shit, this is going to...\n\n35:14.080 --> 35:15.080\nI said nice.\n\n35:15.080 --> 35:19.080\nI know, I know. Originally when you said that though, I thought, wow.\n\n35:19.080 --> 35:25.080\nLook, as everyone has gone out to eat in the city, I'm pretty sure we all come across the narcissistic waiter\n\n35:25.080 --> 35:28.080\nand then there's, you know, the overtly nice people.\n\n35:28.080 --> 35:34.080\nI was one of the waitresses that was super nice. That's why I never got fired right away, but...\n\n35:34.080 --> 35:37.080\nYou got fired for embezzling later on down the road?\n\n35:37.080 --> 35:41.080\nNo, I once got fired for telling someone that they were inadvertently fat.\n\n35:41.080 --> 35:42.080\nI didn't mean to.\n\n35:42.080 --> 35:44.080\nWait, you said they were inadvertently fat?\n\n35:44.080 --> 35:46.080\nNo, I didn't say that. Well, it's like, okay.\n\n35:46.080 --> 35:51.080\nSo this lady comes in and she orders a chicken pot pie, right?\n\n35:51.080 --> 35:54.080\nBut prior to ordering it, her friends are like, oh, she just got wisdom teeth.\n\n35:54.080 --> 35:57.080\nWhat do you think about the chicken pot pie?\n\n35:57.080 --> 36:00.080\nI said, it's too heavy for you. I said that.\n\n36:00.080 --> 36:06.080\nI was referencing texture, but I wasn't smart enough to say, oh, the texture for that is too heavy for your teeth.\n\n36:06.080 --> 36:08.080\nI just said, oh, yeah, that's too heavy.\n\n36:08.080 --> 36:12.080\nSo she equates that with, oh, you're calling me fat? She told my manager, I got fired.\n\n36:12.080 --> 36:13.080\nWow.\n\n36:13.080 --> 36:14.080\nThere you go.\n\n36:14.080 --> 36:15.080\nHoly crap.\n\n36:15.080 --> 36:16.080\nThat would be...\n\n36:16.080 --> 36:17.080\nWas she fat?\n\n36:17.080 --> 36:20.080\nNo, she was okay. You know, she wasn't...\n\n36:20.080 --> 36:21.080\nShe was fat.\n\n36:21.080 --> 36:26.080\nNo, she was a little stocky, but I'm not going to say that.\n\n36:26.080 --> 36:31.080\nShe was a little stocky, but I'm not going to say that.\n\n36:31.080 --> 36:35.080\nBut I'm curious though, because you said it's too heavy for you.\n\n36:35.080 --> 36:40.080\nIt's the for you that made her go, oh, what did you mean by for you?\n\n36:40.080 --> 36:43.080\nWell, I should have said, no, the texture of chicken pot pie, we've all had it.\n\n36:43.080 --> 36:47.080\nIt's basically mashed potatoes in a pie. Come on, and peas and chicken.\n\n36:47.080 --> 36:51.080\nBut you were saying for her, why?\n\n36:51.080 --> 36:53.080\nBecause she just got wisdom teeth surgery.\n\n36:53.080 --> 36:57.080\nOh, why did you know that? She said that?\n\n36:57.080 --> 36:59.080\nDid I not say that earlier?\n\n36:59.080 --> 37:04.080\nOh, okay, sorry. Hey, I'm a terrible interviewer. I was probably thinking about...\n\n37:04.080 --> 37:08.080\nYou're probably only a terrible interviewer because you keep telling yourself that you're a terrible interviewer.\n\n37:08.080 --> 37:10.080\nDuring the interviews, yeah, instead of listening.\n\n37:10.080 --> 37:14.080\nDo you ever not interview yourself in the bathtub? You can get better that way.\n\n37:14.080 --> 37:19.080\nNo. You're talking about jerking off, right?\n\n37:19.080 --> 37:23.080\nYou interview yourself in your bathtub?\n\n37:23.080 --> 37:25.080\nI interview myself all the time in the bathtub.\n\n37:25.080 --> 37:32.080\nYou never fantasize about being on David Letterman or that kind of thing or Barbara Walters and having them tell you specific questions?\n\n37:32.080 --> 37:37.080\nI think maybe when I was a lot younger, yeah, I would have fantasies about being on a panel.\n\n37:37.080 --> 37:42.080\nLet's say that you were on Letterman tonight or Conan. Do you have a Conan or Letterman story?\n\n37:42.080 --> 37:46.080\nWhat would be your go-to anecdote that you would say?\n\n37:46.080 --> 37:50.080\nI don't know. It depends on... Why don't I have plenty of things?\n\n37:50.080 --> 37:54.080\nYou're the one that practices all this shit. You don't have a go-to?\n\n37:54.080 --> 37:58.080\nDo you have a fantasy reason why you would be that noteworthy?\n\n37:58.080 --> 38:02.080\nYeah, I don't want to work at Starbucks for the rest of my life.\n\n38:02.080 --> 38:08.080\nIn your fantasy, when you're on Letterman, why is Letterman having you on in the fantasies?\n\n38:08.080 --> 38:11.080\nIs it because of a bookie road or is it because of a dance you do?\n\n38:11.080 --> 38:16.080\nYeah, I invented the... No, I just... Yeah, I don't know, for whatever reason.\n\n38:16.080 --> 38:18.080\nYou just finished making that up.\n\n38:18.080 --> 38:21.080\nI take over your job.\n\n38:21.080 --> 38:22.080\nOkay, well...\n\n38:22.080 --> 38:24.080\nNo, I'm kidding. That's interesting.\n\n38:24.080 --> 38:27.080\nIt's going to be the toughest shoes you'll ever fill.\n\n38:27.080 --> 38:31.080\nYou'll have to learn how to not listen to people while you're interviewing them.\n\n38:31.080 --> 38:41.080\nThat's interesting to me, though, because you're fantasizing about being on David Letterman,\n\n38:41.080 --> 38:46.080\nand he's just going, our next guest is Lisette, and let's bring her out.\n\n38:46.080 --> 38:48.080\nAnd you're like, hey!\n\n38:48.080 --> 38:52.080\nAnd he's like, that is an amazing dress you're wearing,\n\n38:52.080 --> 38:54.080\nand you talk about the dress and you tell some...\n\n38:54.080 --> 38:58.080\nThe interesting thing about it to me is it makes me realize the people that are on Letterman\n\n38:58.080 --> 39:02.080\nare just plugging a movie, but it's not like they come out and do a scene from it.\n\n39:02.080 --> 39:05.080\nThey just come out and they talk about parking tickets.\n\n39:05.080 --> 39:08.080\nHave you noticed that every interviewer has their different thing?\n\n39:08.080 --> 39:11.080\nConan O'Brien lets pretty girls touch his hair.\n\n39:11.080 --> 39:13.080\nYou want to touch his hair?\n\n39:13.080 --> 39:16.080\nHe pretends that his hair is alive or whatever.\n\n39:16.080 --> 39:19.080\nDavid Letterman tends to hit on really pretty girls,\n\n39:19.080 --> 39:21.080\nand he makes awkward people feel even more awkward.\n\n39:21.080 --> 39:23.080\nHe's kind of mean, but he's kind of nice at the same time.\n\n39:23.080 --> 39:26.080\nMaybe he just plays favorites, but I don't know.\n\n39:26.080 --> 39:28.080\nYou could talk to him about that on the panel.\n\n39:28.080 --> 39:30.080\nYou'd come out and you'd turn the tables on him,\n\n39:30.080 --> 39:32.080\nand he'd be like, wow, what's happening?\n\n39:32.080 --> 39:36.080\nAnd he'd be like, I'm Lisette, mother fucker.\n\n39:36.080 --> 39:39.080\nWell, thank you, Lisette, for sharing your information.\n\n39:39.080 --> 39:41.080\nThank you.\n\n39:47.080 --> 39:50.080\nThat was experienced wait-person, Lisette,\n\n39:50.080 --> 39:53.080\non how to make a wait-person feel bad.\n\n39:53.080 --> 39:56.080\nI worked as a busboy once, and it was the worst.\n\n39:56.080 --> 40:00.080\nI was so bad at it, because I hate people.\n\n40:00.080 --> 40:02.080\nBusboys hate people?\n\n40:02.080 --> 40:04.080\nNo, I hate people.\n\n40:04.080 --> 40:07.080\nI worked at a country club, and so it was just rich,\n\n40:07.080 --> 40:09.080\nrich white douchebags.\n\n40:09.080 --> 40:12.080\nAnd I was broke, and it was a terrible job.\n\n40:12.080 --> 40:16.080\nAnd one time I came out, and we had to build everything.\n\n40:16.080 --> 40:18.080\nYou had to put a dance floor together,\n\n40:18.080 --> 40:20.080\nand they'd put sectional walls up\n\n40:20.080 --> 40:22.080\nand carry these giant tables out.\n\n40:22.080 --> 40:24.080\nAnd the time that the guests were there,\n\n40:24.080 --> 40:26.080\nyou were exhausted and you were cut,\n\n40:26.080 --> 40:28.080\nwe always had the band-aids on.\n\n40:28.080 --> 40:30.080\nI was serving food, it was totally gross,\n\n40:30.080 --> 40:32.080\nand I was carrying a tray out,\n\n40:32.080 --> 40:36.080\nand it had 15 or so little silver coffee creamer,\n\n40:36.080 --> 40:38.080\nlike creamer tins in it.\n\n40:38.080 --> 40:41.080\nAnd I had to put one on each table,\n\n40:41.080 --> 40:45.080\nand I knocked, I was so tired and fatigued,\n\n40:45.080 --> 40:48.080\nI dropped it all over the back of a lady\n\n40:48.080 --> 40:51.080\nin a black velvet dress.\n\n40:51.080 --> 40:53.080\nAnd everybody lizzes.\n\n40:53.080 --> 40:55.080\nI felt bad, she felt bad, the husband felt bad,\n\n40:55.080 --> 40:57.080\neveryone in the world died a little bit.\n\n40:57.080 --> 40:59.080\nAnd the husband got up,\n\n40:59.080 --> 41:01.080\nand he just started screaming at me.\n\n41:01.080 --> 41:04.080\nAnd I wanted to disappear and die,\n\n41:04.080 --> 41:06.080\nand I'd do anything to make that not happen.\n\n41:06.080 --> 41:08.080\nI'm just blushing.\n\n41:08.080 --> 41:10.080\nAnd this guy, he's about a head shorter than me,\n\n41:10.080 --> 41:13.080\nbut he's a big, stocky little fucker.\n\n41:13.080 --> 41:15.080\nHe just turns purple, and he's like,\n\n41:15.080 --> 41:17.080\nGod damn it, he just starts screaming at me.\n\n41:17.080 --> 41:21.080\nAnd the wife was covered in creamer tins.\n\n41:21.080 --> 41:23.080\nI'm covered in shame,\n\n41:23.080 --> 41:25.080\nand I just looked at the guy and I go,\n\n41:25.080 --> 41:27.080\nenough.\n\n41:27.080 --> 41:29.080\nAnd I put my finger in his face,\n\n41:29.080 --> 41:32.080\nand he kept yelling, I go, shut up.\n\n41:32.080 --> 41:35.080\nLike, you're yelling is not making her happier.\n\n41:35.080 --> 41:38.080\nLike, you need, I'm going to murder you,\n\n41:38.080 --> 41:40.080\nbecause you're making this worse.\n\n41:40.080 --> 41:48.080\nAnd then I called my manager a cunt, and I left.\n\n41:48.080 --> 41:54.080\nFor those listening, Jeff just applauded himself.\n\n41:54.080 --> 41:56.080\nFor those listening, I frequently am underneath the podium.\n\n41:56.080 --> 41:58.080\nI'm frequently applauding myself.\n\n41:58.080 --> 42:00.080\nI think every time I've ever quit a job,\n\n42:00.080 --> 42:02.080\nI've called somebody a cunt.\n\n42:02.080 --> 42:04.080\nIt's better in England, right?\n\n42:04.080 --> 42:06.080\nIt's more of a terrible word here.\n\n42:06.080 --> 42:10.080\nI meant it to hurt.\n\n42:10.080 --> 42:11.080\nI worked in a trade,\n\n42:11.080 --> 42:14.080\nI just stole everything.\n\n42:14.080 --> 42:16.080\nThere's nothing worse you could call another man\n\n42:16.080 --> 42:18.080\nthan the c-word,\n\n42:18.080 --> 42:21.080\nbecause it's a horrible word to call a woman.\n\n42:21.080 --> 42:23.080\nAnd then you're, so then you're calling a man.\n\n42:23.080 --> 42:26.080\nLike, when I've been really angry\n\n42:26.080 --> 42:28.080\nin like, kind of like,\n\n42:28.080 --> 42:30.080\nI can't even think of examples,\n\n42:30.080 --> 42:32.080\nbut like when it's sort of like that primal\n\n42:32.080 --> 42:34.080\nman-on-man rage.\n\n42:34.080 --> 42:37.080\nLike, when I really want a guy to feel really terrible\n\n42:37.080 --> 42:38.080\nabout himself,\n\n42:38.080 --> 42:41.080\nI call him the worst word you can call a woman,\n\n42:41.080 --> 42:44.080\nwhich is interesting.\n\n42:44.080 --> 42:47.080\nIt's kind of the opposite of interesting.\n\n42:47.080 --> 42:49.080\nSo like, the most obvious thing in the world.\n\n42:49.080 --> 42:51.080\nWhat was the last job you had,\n\n42:51.080 --> 42:52.080\nlike before a writer,\n\n42:52.080 --> 42:54.080\nlike the actual like, like a nine to five,\n\n42:54.080 --> 42:56.080\nor like an actual job job?\n\n42:56.080 --> 42:59.080\nThe last time, I mean,\n\n42:59.080 --> 43:02.080\nI think it was as a data entry clerk,\n\n43:02.080 --> 43:04.080\nI think that was my last real job.\n\n43:04.080 --> 43:05.080\nI think after I quit that,\n\n43:05.080 --> 43:07.080\nI was like, I can't,\n\n43:07.080 --> 43:09.080\nbecause I was,\n\n43:09.080 --> 43:12.080\nlike to run down my curriculum vitae.\n\n43:12.080 --> 43:15.080\nIs that how you say that?\n\n43:15.080 --> 43:16.080\nYeah.\n\n43:16.080 --> 43:18.080\nA lot of resume writers here\n\n43:18.080 --> 43:21.080\nthat have that on their CV.\n\n43:21.080 --> 43:23.080\nThe,\n\n43:23.080 --> 43:25.080\nI was,\n\n43:25.080 --> 43:27.080\nI worked as a caddy at the,\n\n43:27.080 --> 43:28.080\nat a country club.\n\n43:28.080 --> 43:29.080\nIt was awful.\n\n43:29.080 --> 43:32.080\nLike you're working for like way sub minimum wage.\n\n43:32.080 --> 43:33.080\nYou have to get like this permit\n\n43:33.080 --> 43:35.080\nthat allows you to be working\n\n43:35.080 --> 43:37.080\nfor not really any money at all.\n\n43:37.080 --> 43:39.080\nAnd then, so you're just reliant on these tips.\n\n43:39.080 --> 43:40.080\nAnd it was like,\n\n43:40.080 --> 43:41.080\nthis Milwaukee country club.\n\n43:41.080 --> 43:42.080\nIt wasn't like,\n\n43:42.080 --> 43:44.080\nit wasn't like they were just like,\n\n43:44.080 --> 43:45.080\nthrowing fifties around.\n\n43:45.080 --> 43:47.080\nLike they would just give you a dollar after you.\n\n43:47.080 --> 43:48.080\nI've had caddies before,\n\n43:48.080 --> 43:49.080\nlike a nice course,\n\n43:49.080 --> 43:50.080\nas I friends are good golfers,\n\n43:50.080 --> 43:51.080\nand I get to go play with them.\n\n43:51.080 --> 43:52.080\nAnd the caddies are actually

knowledge?\n\n43:58.080 --> 43:59.080\nI would just fake it.\n\n43:59.080 --> 44:00.080\nI would go,\n\n44:00.080 --> 44:01.080\ncause like,\n\n44:01.080 --> 44:03.080\ncause the guy would go

certificates\n\n49:04.080 --> 49:05.080\nor receipts.\n\n49:05.080 --> 49:07.080\nI didn't even know I'd be charged\n\n49:07.080 --> 49:09.080\nfor stuff like HBO.\n\n49:12.080 --> 49:14.080\nIt sounds like you're describing something\n\n49:14.080 --> 49:16.080\nother than Apple, sir.\n\n49:16.080 --> 49:18.080\nThis is the AT&T store.\n\n49:18.080 --> 49:19.080\nThis is Apple.\n\n49:19.080 --> 49:21.080\nThe AT&T store.\n\n49:22.080 --> 49:23.080\nI called AT&T corporate\n\n49:23.080 --> 49:25.080\nand they transferred me here.\n\n49:32.080 --> 49:33.080\nLater.\n\n49:33.080 --> 49:34.080\nLater.\n\n49:36.080 --> 49:37.080\nHello, AT&T.\n\n49:37.080 --> 49:39.080\nThis is Destro.\n\n49:41.080 --> 49:43.080\nHe transfers all the AT&T calls\n\n49:43.080 --> 49:44.080\nto Cobra Commander\n\n49:45.080 --> 49:46.080\nbecause he hates him.\n\n49:48.080 --> 49:50.080\nThere was some crazy shit going on\n\n49:50.080 --> 49:51.080\nin GI Joe, man.\n\n49:51.080 --> 49:52.080\nRight when they ended,\n\n49:52.080 --> 49:54.080\nthat was when Destro\n\n49:54.080 --> 49:56.080\nand Professor Meinbender\n\n49:56.080 --> 49:58.080\nwent off on the side\n\n49:58.080 --> 49:59.080\nand they were like,\n\n49:59.080 --> 50:00.080\nI don't think Cobra Commander's doing\n\n50:00.080 --> 50:01.080\na very good job.\n\n50:01.080 --> 50:03.080\nThey made Serpentor\n\n50:03.080 --> 50:05.080\nout of the DNA\n\n50:05.080 --> 50:07.080\nof, like,\n\n50:07.080 --> 50:08.080\n85 different, like,\n\n50:08.080 --> 50:09.080\ndictators\n\n50:09.080 --> 50:11.080\nexcept Hitler.\n\n50:11.080 --> 50:13.080\nBut it's like the elephant in the room.\n\n50:13.080 --> 50:14.080\nThey're like,\n\n50:14.080 --> 50:16.080\nwe're going to get a till of the hood\n\n50:16.080 --> 50:17.080\nand Genghis Khan\n\n50:17.080 --> 50:18.080\nand you're like a kid going,\n\n50:18.080 --> 50:19.080\nwhat about Hitler?\n\n50:22.080 --> 50:23.080\nYeah.\n\n50:23.080 --> 50:24.080\nWe're not tooth bags.\n\n50:26.080 --> 50:27.080\nNapoleon\n\n50:27.080 --> 50:29.080\nand Alexander,\n\n50:29.080 --> 50:31.080\nthe great\n\n50:31.080 --> 50:33.080\nVlad the Impaler was in there\n\n50:33.080 --> 50:35.080\nand then they\n\n50:35.080 --> 50:37.080\nsomebody was like, yeah.\n\n50:37.080 --> 50:39.080\nThey,\n\n50:39.080 --> 50:41.080\nand they activated Serpentor\n\n50:41.080 --> 50:43.080\nand\n\n50:43.080 --> 50:45.080\nhe, of course,\n\n50:45.080 --> 50:47.080\nthey put some frog DNA in there\n\n50:47.080 --> 50:49.080\nor something that made Serpentor,\n\n50:49.080 --> 50:51.080\nlike, really unruly.\n\n50:51.080 --> 50:53.080\nSo then, toward the end\n\n50:53.080 --> 50:55.080\nof GI Joe, like,\n\n50:55.080 --> 50:57.080\nDestro was going back to Cobra\n\n50:57.080 --> 50:59.080\nCommander and going, I'm sorry.\n\n50:59.080 --> 51:01.080\nI've kind of fucked up.\n\n51:01.080 --> 51:02.080\nAnd they were forming like a new,\n\n51:02.080 --> 51:04.080\nthere were like three organizations\n\n51:04.080 --> 51:05.080\nthat were all fighting each other.\n\n51:05.080 --> 51:06.080\nThe thing about GI Joe is\n\n51:06.080 --> 51:08.080\nGI Joe had its shit together,\n\n51:08.080 --> 51:10.080\nran the government\n\n51:10.080 --> 51:12.080\nand there was no infighting\n\n51:12.080 --> 51:14.080\nand then Cobra was just like,\n\n51:14.080 --> 51:16.080\nyou couldn't get through a day over there.\n\n51:16.080 --> 51:17.080\nIt was just like,\n\n51:17.080 --> 51:19.080\nwhy are you always implying\n\n51:19.080 --> 51:20.080\nthat I'm not good?\n\n51:20.080 --> 51:21.080\nI didn't say that.\n\n51:21.080 --> 51:23.080\nI just think we should send\n\n51:23.080 --> 51:25.080\nthe microchips to the rockets.\n\n51:25.080 --> 51:27.080\nThey were like, oh, your insolence\n\n51:27.080 --> 51:29.080\nwill be demanded.\n\n51:29.080 --> 51:31.080\nThey were their own worst enemy.\n\n51:31.080 --> 51:33.080\nYour insolence will be what?\n\n51:33.080 --> 51:35.080\nDemanded, I don't know.\n\n51:35.080 --> 51:37.080\nThey were self-destructive, I'm telling you.\n\n51:37.080 --> 51:39.080\nThey demanded insolence.\n\n51:39.080 --> 51:41.080\nAll right.\n\n51:41.080 --> 51:43.080\nSpencer, do you think you're ever going to get married?\n\n51:43.080 --> 51:45.080\nI mean, God willing.\n\n51:45.080 --> 51:47.080\nYou want to be married?\n\n51:47.080 --> 51:48.080\nSure.\n\n51:48.080 --> 51:50.080\nAnd religiously, of course.\n\n51:50.080 --> 51:52.080\nYeah, I was going to say\n\n51:52.080 --> 51:54.080\nonly religiously, but that's not very funny.\n\n51:54.080 --> 51:56.080\nWhere would your ideal wedding take place?\n\n51:56.080 --> 51:58.080\nI don't care.\n\n51:58.080 --> 52:00.080\nWhy does that matter?\n\n52:00.080 --> 52:02.080\nIt's supposed to be for the bride, right?\n\n52:02.080 --> 52:04.080\nWell, for both.\n\n52:04.080 --> 52:06.080\nI say for the people that have to sit there.\n\n52:06.080 --> 52:08.080\nWell, fuck them.\n\n52:08.080 --> 52:10.080\nNo, the whole inviting them to the wedding\n\n52:10.080 --> 52:11.080\nis fuck them.\n\n52:11.080 --> 52:13.080\nWhen they get there, they want to get drunk\n\n52:13.080 --> 52:14.080\nand they won't.\n\n52:14.080 --> 52:16.080\nThat would be pretty good, though, to have\n\n52:16.080 --> 52:18.080\na Raiders of the Lost Ark wedding,\n\n52:18.080 --> 52:20.080\nbut you have to make everyone that comes,\n\n52:20.080 --> 52:22.080\nincluding grandma and grandpa,\n\n52:22.080 --> 52:24.080\nand then they all get melted.\n\n52:26.080 --> 52:28.080\nThere's all these pyrotechnics and stuff,\n\n52:28.080 --> 52:30.080\nand then these light beams go through their torsos.\n\n52:34.080 --> 52:36.080\nYeah, I just think, I mean, I wouldn't mind...\n\n52:36.080 --> 52:38.080\nI kind of want\n\n52:38.080 --> 52:40.080\nthere to be a character\n\n52:40.080 --> 52:42.080\nat my wedding.\n\n52:42.080 --> 52:44.080\nNot even just at the reception.\n\n52:46.080 --> 52:48.080\nAt the actual, you know, that idea of\n\n52:48.080 --> 52:50.080\nyou're getting married\n\n52:50.080 --> 52:52.080\nand then someone comes in\n\n52:52.080 --> 52:54.080\nfrom the back and says, like,\n\n52:54.080 --> 52:56.080\nI don't think they should get married,\n\n52:56.080 --> 52:58.080\nand then, like, you sort and fight them.\n\n52:58.080 --> 53:00.080\nAnd then you get married.\n\n53:00.080 --> 53:02.080\nJust so that the audience has something.\n\n53:02.080 --> 53:04.080\nI've been a guy in the drawing.\n\n53:04.080 --> 53:06.080\nHis wife is Scottish\n\n53:06.080 --> 53:08.080\nand they got married in Scotland,\n\n53:08.080 --> 53:10.080\nand the ring bearer was the owl\n\n53:10.080 --> 53:12.080\nfrom...\n\n53:12.080 --> 53:14.080\nWhat's the owl from Harry Potter?\n\n53:14.080 --> 53:16.080\nYeah, like, he fucking flew in\n\n53:16.080 --> 53:18.080\nand brought the ring.\n\n53:18.080 --> 53:20.080\nAnd there's a picture of\n\n53:20.080 --> 53:22.080\nthe owl flying in\n\n53:22.080 --> 53:24.080\nwith the ring, and the crowd's like,\n\n53:24.080 --> 53:26.080\nwhat the fuck?\n\n53:26.080 --> 53:28.080\nIs that headwind?\n\n53:28.080 --> 53:30.080\nOr headwind?\n\n53:30.080 --> 53:32.080\nSo you got to outdo that.\n\n53:32.080 --> 53:34.080\nYou got the budget.\n\n53:34.080 --> 53:36.080\nYeah, but I want a nest egg.\n\n53:36.080 --> 53:38.080\nI'm going to become very miserly,\n\n53:38.080 --> 53:40.080\nbecause I want to retire\n\n53:40.080 --> 53:42.080\nand I don't want to have to\n\n53:42.080 --> 53:44.080\nworry about running out of money.\n\n53:44.080 --> 53:46.080\nSo I'm going to become very\n\n53:46.080 --> 53:48.080\nthrifty.\n\n53:48.080 --> 53:50.080\nI'm just going to get married\n\n53:50.080 --> 53:52.080\nand stack\n\n53:52.080 --> 53:54.080\na bunch of milk crates\n\n53:54.080 --> 53:56.080\nand\n\n53:56.080 --> 53:58.080\nknock them down and then say,\n\n53:58.080 --> 54:00.080\nI do.\n\n54:00.080 --> 54:02.080\nThe ring will be in one of the crates,\n\n54:02.080 --> 54:04.080\nI don't know.\n\n54:04.080 --> 54:06.080\nYou guys going to have kids?\n\n54:06.080 --> 54:08.080\nThat to me is the larger\n\n54:08.080 --> 54:10.080\npoint of getting married.\n\n54:10.080 --> 54:12.080\nAlthough Rob, Schrab, and Kate throwing,\n\n54:12.080 --> 54:14.080\nthey don't seem to have any plans to have kids,\n\n54:14.080 --> 54:16.080\nthey were together for so long,\n\n54:16.080 --> 54:18.080\nas Rob said very touchingly.\n\n54:18.080 --> 54:20.080\nHe had run out of ways to\n\n54:20.080 --> 54:22.080\nmake her understand how much he loved her,\n\n54:22.080 --> 54:24.080\nand so they decided to get married.\n\n54:24.080 --> 54:26.080\nWhich was one of the most romantic weddings in the world,\n\n54:26.080 --> 54:28.080\nbecause they didn't have to.\n\n54:28.080 --> 54:30.080\nIt wasn't like a precursor to having kids\n\n54:30.080 --> 54:32.080\nthat it weren't divorced, as usually is the case.\n\n54:32.080 --> 54:34.080\nYou knew\n\n54:34.080 --> 54:36.080\nthat they were going to be together forever,\n\n54:36.080 --> 54:38.080\nbecause they didn't have to get married.\n\n54:38.080 --> 54:40.080\nThey already lived together for like eight years,\n\n54:40.080 --> 54:42.080\nand then they were just getting married,\n\n54:42.080 --> 54:44.080\nand that was the first wedding I was at,\n\n54:44.080 --> 54:46.080\nthat I was like, holy shit, this is the real deal.\n\n54:46.080 --> 54:48.080\nYou guys should get married to Harmontown.\n\n54:48.080 --> 54:50.080\nIt just seems a little tacky.\n\n54:50.080 --> 54:52.080\nNot that you applauded something tacky,\n\n54:52.080 --> 54:54.080\nfor those of you who started applauding.\n\n54:54.080 --> 54:56.080\nIt's like Tiny Tim getting married\n\n54:56.080 --> 54:58.080\non Carson or something.\n\n54:58.080 --> 55:00.080\nWhat was that?\n\n55:00.080 --> 55:02.080\nWhat?\n\n55:02.080 --> 55:04.080\nHe's referencing some old shit.\n\n55:04.080 --> 55:06.080\nUh,\n\n55:06.080 --> 55:08.080\nyou know, it's like,\n\n55:10.080 --> 55:12.080\nAdam, are you going to get married?\n\n55:12.080 --> 55:14.080\nSure, why not.\n\n55:14.080 --> 55:16.080\nOkay.\n\n55:16.080 --> 55:18.080\nGeez.\n\n55:18.080 --> 55:20.080\nShe's not.\n\n55:24.080 --> 55:26.080\nWhat would be the most romantic wedding?\n\n55:26.080 --> 55:28.080\nHow would you get married?\n\n55:28.080 --> 55:30.080\nI was in Barcelona once,\n\n55:30.080 --> 55:32.080\nwhen I was really broke,\n\n55:32.080 --> 55:34.080\nand I was on a cruise ship,\n\n55:34.080 --> 55:36.080\nand we made a bunch of money on the ship,\n\n55:36.080 --> 55:38.080\nand I just took the money I made\n\n55:38.080 --> 55:40.080\nand stayed in Barcelona for a few days.\n\n55:40.080 --> 55:42.080\nAnd I was walking around the Gothic Quarter,\n\n55:42.080 --> 55:44.080\nand it's like very narrow streets,\n\n55:44.080 --> 55:46.080\nand there's like Salvador Dalí,\n\n55:46.080 --> 55:48.080\nyou know, like exhibits and stuff,\n\n55:48.080 --> 55:50.080\nand there's really cool little fruit stands,\n\n55:50.080 --> 55:52.080\nand then it opened up into this big square,\n\n55:52.080 --> 55:54.080\nand there was like, the streets are so narrow,\n\n55:54.080 --> 55:56.080\nyou can't really see the top of buildings,\n\n55:56.080 --> 55:58.080\nand I walked in, and it was the biggest cathedral in the world.\n\n55:58.080 --> 56:00.080\nIt was just like this enormous,\n\n56:00.080 --> 56:02.080\nhuge cathedral, and there was a choir singing\n\n56:02.080 --> 56:04.080\nfrom somewhere.\n\n56:04.080 --> 56:06.080\nYou couldn't even see where the choir was,\n\n56:06.080 --> 56:08.080\nand on the far side, there was a wedding going on.\n\n56:08.080 --> 56:10.080\nThere was like 12 people there.\n\n56:10.080 --> 56:12.080\nIn the back, there were old ladies lighting candles,\n\n56:12.080 --> 56:14.080\nand it was very Catholic and doing that,\n\n56:14.080 --> 56:16.080\nbut in the distance, it was like falsetto choir singing,\n\n56:16.080 --> 56:18.080\nand there was a wedding going on.\n\n56:18.080 --> 56:20.080\nThere was doves flying around in the rafters,\n\n56:20.080 --> 56:22.080\nand it was really lonely and like somber,\n\n56:22.080 --> 56:24.080\nand I thought that's how I would do it.\n\n56:24.080 --> 56:26.080\nAnd I would invite like a few people,\n\n56:26.080 --> 56:28.080\nand I would come back to LA,\n\n56:28.080 --> 56:30.080\nand have a big party for everybody else,\n\n56:30.080 --> 56:32.080\nbut whoever wanted to come out to\n\n56:32.080 --> 56:34.080\nlike, whatever part of Europe or wherever\n\n56:34.080 --> 56:36.080\nwe found the cool castle, we would do it there.\n\n56:36.080 --> 56:38.080\nHmm, alright.\n\n56:45.080 --> 56:47.080\nHe's applauded himself.\n\n56:47.080 --> 56:49.080\nI'll see if I can make it.\n\n56:49.080 --> 56:51.080\nI don't know.\n\n56:53.080 --> 56:55.080\nSounds a little...\n\n56:55.080 --> 56:58.080\nIt's knobby.\n\n56:59.080 --> 57:01.080\nYou're invited.\n\n57:02.080 --> 57:04.080\nI don't know if I'd fit in.\n\n57:05.080 --> 57:07.080\nSeems a little fancy,\n\n57:07.080 --> 57:10.080\nbut it's like a coffee commercial.\n\n57:13.080 --> 57:15.080\nExactly, this would be IP.\n\n57:15.080 --> 57:17.080\nYou'd love it because nothing would be required of you.\n\n57:17.080 --> 57:19.080\nYou would just come, and then it would be over,\n\n57:19.080 --> 57:21.080\nand then we'd all go out and have a drink.\n\n57:21.080 --> 57:22.080\nAlright.\n\n57:22.080 --> 57:25.080\nYou got me at the close.\n\n57:25.080 --> 57:27.080\nAlright, well, why don't we roll into\n\n57:27.080 --> 57:29.080\nour role-playing adventure?\n\n57:29.080 --> 57:30.080\nLet's do it.\n\n57:30.080 --> 57:32.080\nNice and early.\n\n57:32.080 --> 57:34.080\nAre we bringing up guests to play Camille\n\n57:34.080 --> 57:36.080\nor Erin, or should we just go...\n\n57:36.080 --> 57:37.080\nWhat do you think, Spencer?\n\n57:37.080 --> 57:38.080\nAl fresco.\n\n57:38.080 --> 57:39.080\nWhatever you guys want.\n\n57:39.080 --> 57:40.080\nAh, come on.\n\n57:40.080 --> 57:43.080\nHave a opinion.\n\n57:44.080 --> 57:46.080\nI'm dying.\n\n57:47.080 --> 57:48.080\nYou're dying?\n\n57:48.080 --> 57:52.080\nIt's more of like an observation, really.\n\n57:53.080 --> 57:55.080\nNot really an opinion.\n\n57:57.080 --> 57:59.080\nAre you really dying, Spencer?\n\n57:59.080 --> 58:01.080\nNah, I'm cool.\n\n58:01.080 --> 58:03.080\nWere you bummed when Steve Jobs died?\n\n58:03.080 --> 58:05.080\nNo, no.\n\n58:07.080 --> 58:08.080\nQuite the opposite.\n\n58:08.080 --> 58:09.080\nI'm actually...\n\n58:09.080 --> 58:12.080\nI'm more bothered by it now, like, retroactively\n\n58:12.080 --> 58:14.080\nthan I was when it, like, happened.\n\n58:14.080 --> 58:16.080\nBecause it affected the health plan?\n\n58:16.080 --> 58:18.080\nNo, I mean, that didn't happen, like,\n\n58:18.080 --> 58:20.080\nI don't even think I got a job until after he died\n\n58:20.080 --> 58:21.080\nor whatever.\n\n58:21.080 --> 58:24.080\nI mean, I don't know, but it's just...\n\n58:24.080 --> 58:27.080\nI mean, he was like a genius.\n\n58:27.080 --> 58:28.080\nYeah, he's a visionary.\n\n58:28.080 --> 58:30.080\nYeah, there's not too many people like that,\n\n58:30.080 --> 58:32.080\nand it's like, you know, the world can kind of\n\n58:32.080 --> 58:35.080\nspin its wheels and, like, march in exerably forward,\n\n58:35.080 --> 58:38.080\nbut all the good leaps are by some crazy cool guy\n\n58:38.080 --> 58:40.080\nthat, like, leads people.\n\n58:40.080 --> 58:42.080\nYou kind of pointed at me when you said that.\n\n58:42.080 --> 58:44.080\nYeah.\n\n58:44.080 --> 58:48.080\nWhat I'm trying to say is it takes a special kind of person\n\n58:48.080 --> 58:50.080\nwith a special kind of charisma.\n\n58:50.080 --> 58:51.080\nHe didn't point at you.\n\n58:51.080 --> 58:53.080\nHis hand moved toward his backpack.\n\n58:53.080 --> 58:55.080\nNo, he just kind of flicked his wrist a little bit.\n\n58:55.080 --> 58:56.080\nI felt like it was pointing at me.\n\n58:56.080 --> 58:58.080\nA perceived point.\n\n58:58.080 --> 59:00.080\nWell, you know, Jeff, the world can move\n\n59:00.080 --> 59:03.080\nin exerably forward, but the kinds of people\n\n59:03.080 --> 59:06.080\nwho decide they want to be pointed at\n\n59:06.080 --> 59:09.080\nget pointed at.\n\n59:09.080 --> 59:12.080\nI'm the Steve Jobs of thinking people\n\n59:12.080 --> 59:16.080\nare pointing at me.\n\n59:16.080 --> 59:19.080\nI don't know how I went down this rabbit hole,\n\n59:19.080 --> 59:26.080\nbut I was looking at quotes from him and stuff.\n\n59:26.080 --> 59:28.080\nThis is really a very interesting guy.\n\n59:28.080 --> 59:30.080\nIsn't there a biopic coming out about him?\n\n59:30.080 --> 59:32.080\nIsn't Ashton Kutcher playing that?\n\n59:32.080 --> 59:34.080\nYeah, he's a trainwreck.\n\n59:34.080 --> 59:36.080\nI don't know why that's a bummer, but it is.\n\n59:36.080 --> 59:38.080\nAshton Kutcher won the Teen Choice Award.\n\n59:38.080 --> 59:40.080\nThere's a video that went kind of viral\n\n59:40.080 --> 59:42.080\nof Ashton Kutcher winning his Teen Choice Award,\n\n59:42.080 --> 59:46.080\nand he went up and he broke it down.\n\n59:46.080 --> 59:49.080\nHe said that his first name is not Ashton.\n\n59:49.080 --> 59:51.080\nThat's Chris or something.\n\n59:51.080 --> 59:54.080\nChris Kutcher.\n\n59:54.080 --> 59:56.080\nIt occurs to me, Anatoly, that that is what...\n\n59:56.080 --> 59:58.080\nOkay, this is a fucking deep-cut\n\n59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.080\nHarmontown reference, but when Anatoly\n\n01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.080\nwas at the Rick and Morty panel at Comic-Con\n\n01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.080\nand you were pointing at your shirt\n\n01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.080\nyou had an Archer t-shirt on,\n\n01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.080\nthat's what I thought you were saying.\n\n01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.080\nAshton Kutcher.\n\n01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.080\nAshton Kutcher.\n\n01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.080\nAnyways.\n\n01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.080\nBut Ashton Kutcher went up and he...\n\n01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.080\nYou know, there's just 16-year-old girls\n\n01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.080\nscreaming the whole time he's talking,\n\n01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.080\nbut he decided to\n\n01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.080\nprofess the virtues of hard labor\n\n01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.080\nand creativity.\n\n01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.080\nHe said, I never had a job\n\n01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.080\nthat I felt above.\n\n01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.080\nI've swept floors,\n\n01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.080\nI've done this, I've done that,\n\n01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.080\nand I never felt like I was above my job.\n\n01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.080\nI just worked hard and tried to get a better job,\n\n01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.080\nwhich is sort of,\n\n01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.080\nyou know, it's not very subversive,\n\n01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.080\nbut\n\n01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.080\nI guess it's better than everyone dreams\n\n01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.080\nso you can have a limo too.\n\n01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.080\nAnd then he...\n\n01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.080\nThe nicer thing was that he really\n\n01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.080\nespoused the virtues of\n\n01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.080\nbeing a proactive, creative thinker.\n\n01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.080\nHe said, you know,\n\n01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.080\nyou don't live within the world\n\n01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.080\nthat you're going into.\n\n01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.080\nYou don't get it as a thing that needs to be expanded\n\n01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.080\nand built upon.\n\n01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.080\nGo to the moon, Dan Harmon, he said.\n\n01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.080\nSo when you're at home,\n\n01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.080\nJimmy's watching the Teen Choice Awards.\n\n01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.080\nI'm like, wait a minute,\n\n01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.080\nthere's no teens on here.\n\n01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.080\nBack to 4chan.\n\n01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.080\nI misinterpreted the title of this thing entirely.\n\n01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:34.080\nThis is a bunch of old guys accepting awards.\n\n01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.080\nBut anyways, Ashton Kutcher.\n\n01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.080\nHis name's not Ashton.\n\n01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.080\nAnd he's going to be playing Steve Jobs,\n\n01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.080\nwho I just found out years after he died\n\n01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.080\nwas an interesting guy.\n\n01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.080\nIt was right under my nose that he was\n\n01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.080\nusing all his products,\n\n01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.080\ncalling Spencer at work,\n\n01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.080\njust to tell him that\n\n01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.080\nthere's a camera in it.\n\n01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.080\nLet's do this.\n\n01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.080\nSo no people then?\n\n01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.080\nSo you want people up there?\n\n01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.080\nNo, I'm just clarifying.\n\n01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.080\nSeems like he wants people.\n\n01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.080\nWhat should we base our who we bring up on?\n\n01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.080\nI know the subreddit,\n\n01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.080\nthe Harmontown subreddit,\n\n01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.080\nwas very enthralled with young Tyler last week.\n\n01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.080\nIs it a meritocracy?\n\n01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.080\nDoes he just earn another chance\n\n01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.080\non the wheel?\n\n01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.080\nI think he earned it.\n\n01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.080\nMaybe we bring Tyler up\n\n01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.080\nand we bring someone new up.\n\n01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.080\nOkay.\n\n01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.080\nWhat's that?\n\n01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.080\nTyler and Lizette, would you like to play?\n\n01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.080\nSure.\n\n01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.080\nOkay.\n\n01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.080\nHi.\n\n01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.080\nHi, how are you?\n\n01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.080\nSpencer, just to make things different,\n\n01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.080\nthe description of the catch is up to date.\n\n01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.080\nCan we do it to the song?\n\n01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.080\nCan we?\n\n01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.080\nYeah, sure, why not?\n\n01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.080\nI'm going to start it from the top.\n\n01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.080\nI should hope so.\n\n01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.080\nThe character shoots are being dispensered?\n\n01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.080\nThank you, Tyler.\n\n01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.080\nThere's like three name puns that exist for me\n\n01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.080\nand I've heard them all.\n\n01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.080\nWhat are the other two?\n\n01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.080\nI have no idea.\n\n01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.080\nI'm not going to abuse that power.\n\n01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.080\nI just want to know what the other two are.\n\n01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.080\nYeah, I know, but no one that will ever hear this\n\n01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.080\ninteracts with me on any level or medium.\n\n01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.080\nWould you rather simply\n\n01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.080\narm us and be done with it\n\n01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.080\nor sit through the next 10-minute brainstorming session?\n\n01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.080\nBecause the suspense is killing me.\n\n01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.080\nTwo out of three.\n\n01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.080\nIt sounds like dispensership.\n\n01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.080\nThat's the third.\n\n01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.080\nNo, that's the...\n\n01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.080\nDispensership?\n\n01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.080\nWell, you already did dispensership.\n\n01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.080\nHe was doing censorship.\n\n01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.080\nYeah, no.\n\n01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.080\nI'm done.\n\n01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.080\nSounds like you had it really bad.\n\n01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.080\nMy last name rhymed\n\n01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.080\nwith the lead\n\n01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.080\nselling toilet paper.\n\n01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.080\nThere was commercials all over the...\n\n01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.080\nDid anyone literally call you\n\n01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.080\ndon't squeeze the Harmon?\n\n01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.080\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\n01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.080\nEvery day.\n\n01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.080\nYou guys are too young to remember.\n\n01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.080\nThere was this guy, Mr. Whipple.\n\n01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.080\nApparently, people loved wiping their ass\n\n01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.080\nin the 70s.\n\n01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.080\nThere's that cartoon bear now,\n\n01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.080\nwhich I think is interesting.\n\n01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.080\nPeople latch on\n\n01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.080\nto pop culture references\n\n01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.080\njust to make fun of you.\n\n01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.080\nI'm Tyler and on the late end of high school\n\n01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.080\nthat was coming up like, oh, what's up, Tyler Durden?\n\n01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.080\nI'm like, I'm not insulted?\n\n01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.080\nYeah, that's just\n\n01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.080\nfuture Verizon employees just exercising\n\n01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.080\ntheir little muscle\n\n01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.080\nin the back of their spine.\n\n01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:58.080\nLisette, did you get teased?\n\n01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.080\nDid your name rhyme with anything funny?\n\n01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.080\nOr is there a Lisette tease?\n\n01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.080\nI got teased in high school\n\n01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.080\nbecause I was really tall and skinny\n\n01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.080\nand I had perfect skin and really nice hair.\n\n01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:10.080\nShe is very beautiful\n\n01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.080\nfor the record.\n\n01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.080\nI was about to tease you\n\n01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.080\nfor the same reasons.\n\n01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.080\nShe's so pretty.\n\n01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.080\nI looked relatively normal\n\n01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.080\nbut the second I opened my mouth\n\n01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.080\nit was like, oh, she's a dork. Never mind.\n\n01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.080\nShe looks okay, but she's pretty nerdy,\n\n01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.080\nso yeah, I got made fun of\n\n01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.080\nnumerous times, numerous.\n\n01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:32.080\nThe worst one I ever heard\n\n01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.080\nwas about this girl, Leah.\n\n01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.080\nI don't know if it was JD's wife\n\n01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.080\nor I was\n\n01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.080\nhaving this conversation with a woman\n\n01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.080\nnamed Leah\n\n01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.080\nand\n\n01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.080\nwe were talking about, well, what was the\n\n01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.080\nhorrible thing they said about you on the playground?\n\n01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.080\nShe was like, man, I had the worst\n\n01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.080\nand I thought of her name and I was like, what, Princess Leah?\n\n01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.080\nWhat? She was like,\n\n01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.080\nLeotard.\n\n01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.080\nThey called her Leotard.\n\n01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.080\nThe first thing that came to mind was like, Dyer,\n\n01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.080\nLeah? Diarrhea.\n\n01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:06.080\nSuch a pretty name\n\n01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.080\nand then so maligned.\n\n01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.080\nYeah, if you want to name a kid\n\n01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.080\na name that cannot be teased, Jeff Davis,\n\n01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.080\nnothing funny rhymes with that.\n\n01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.080\nIt's...\n\n01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.080\nJeff Gavis.\n\n01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.080\nGavis, yeah, but it's like, it doesn't really\n\n01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.080\nhurt you because you're so gay.\n\n01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.080\nWhich is great.\n\n01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.080\nBecause gay people are amazing.\n\n01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.080\nThat wedding you described, super gay.\n\n01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.080\nOh, yeah, I'm going to marry a dude there.\n\n01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.080\nHave you ever been to a gay wedding?\n\n01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.080\nUh, yeah.\n\n01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.080\nNo, I haven't.\n\n01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.080\nHave you? No.\n\n01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.080\nI don't think. Are you proposing?\n\n01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.080\nAm I what? Am I proposing?\n\n01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.080\nHave you ever been to a gay wedding?\n\n01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.080\nWould you like to?\n\n01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.080\nLet's have a gay wedding right now.\n\n01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.080\nI extend a hand.\n\n01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.080\nYou open up a jack-o'-lantern and there's a ring.\n\n01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.080\nAlso happy Halloween, apparently.\n\n01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.080\nI don't know.\n\n01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.080\nNo, I don't think I have...\n\n01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.080\nThat's not true. I've actually been...\n\n01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.080\nI have been to a gay wedding.\n\n01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.080\nI guess it's a good sign that I can't really\n\n01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.080\nremember.\n\n01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.080\nOh, you're an alcoholic.\n\n01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.080\nYeah, I mean, I don't have a good memory,\n\n01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:18.080\nbut that's a good sign\n\n01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.080\nthat I wasn't like,\n\n01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.080\nfuck, I'll never forget that gay wedding!\n\n01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.080\nIt was so gay!\n\n01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.080\nIt was like, you know, if I was\n\n01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.080\nat a gay wedding, two men\n\n01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.080\ndecided to spend the rest of their lives together\n\n01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:34.080\nand blend it into the other people.\n\n01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.080\nAll weddings are gay.\n\n01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.080\nThey are the gayest things that street people can ever do.\n\n01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.080\nWhich is another reason\n\n01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.080\nwhy gay marriage should absolutely be a thing.\n\n01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.080\nIt's like, let these people\n\n01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.080\ninto their house.\n\n01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.080\nThey've been planning all of our weddings forever.\n\n01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.080\nExactly.\n\n01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.080\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.080\nSo in a normal wedding, the dudes pretty much just\n\n01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:56.080\nhands off whatever you do, whatever you want to do, honey.\n\n01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:58.080\nIs it in the situation of a gay wedding where\n\n01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:00.080\nthey're both really hands-on and that's even worse?\n\n01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.080\nNo, I think in most couples,\n\n01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.080\nthere's always the male\n\n01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.080\narchetype and the female archetype, regardless of\n\n01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.080\nwhat your sex is, I think.\n\n01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.080\nMaybe I'm just saying because\n\n01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.080\nmy, okay, I'm sorry,\n\n01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.080\nbut my lovely\n\n01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.080\nmy lovely cousin who is gay\n\n01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.080\nwas going to marry his boyfriend,\n\n01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.080\nbut, you know,\n\n01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.080\nI'm allowed an opinion and I just think\n\n01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.080\nthat most couples are the dude and there's the girl\n\n01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.080\nregardless of what sex you are, that could\n\n01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.080\nbe an archetype, I'm just saying,\n\n01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.080\nso I'm allowed an opinion so y'all can suck it, okay?\n\n01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.080\nI was very defensive about that.\n\n01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.080\nI don't like being told that I'm wrong and even if I'm wrong,\n\n01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.080\ndisrespect the fact that I'm up here talking.\n\n01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.080\nThank you, I'm just saying.\n\n01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.080\nWho was groaning out there?\n\n01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.080\nYou, ma'am, you just agree with that?\n\n01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.080\nThat there's a male and female archetype?\n\n01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.080\nI mean, it's just not true.\n\n01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.080\nYeah, it's just not true.\n\n01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.080\nThat's a stereotype that's existed.\n\n01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.080\nWell, nothing's true that you're going to say\n\n01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.080\nabout everybody, yeah, so.\n\n01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.080\nYeah, I just think it's unfair to make\n\n01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.080\nthose sorts of generalizations,\n\n01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.080\nand as someone who\n\n01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.080\nis queer and who knows\n\n01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.080\nor has experienced a fair amount of gay weddings,\n\n01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.080\nthere are plenty of people where both members\n\n01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.080\nof the couple are instantly involved with all\n\n01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.080\nof the planning, and straight weddings, too.\n\n01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.080\nLike, my friends just got married,\n\n01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.080\nthey were both\n\n01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.080\ntotally hands-on, so, you know.\n\n01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.080\nThat's one of the first questions\n\n01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.080\nthat straight people have about gay people is,\n\n01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.080\nis there a,\n\n01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.080\nwhether it's a lesbian couple\n\n01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.080\nor a gay male couple,\n\n01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.080\nthat's the first question is,\n\n01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.080\nis there a hierarchy?\n\n01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.080\nBut really, the obvious answer is,\n\n01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.080\nbecause I'm in a relationship where\n\n01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.080\nthere's no clear hierarchy.\n\n01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.080\nLike, I'm not.\n\n01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.080\nSo obviously, there's not going to be always\n\n01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.080\na\n\n01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.080\ndude\n\n01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.080\nand a, I don't even know\n\n01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.080\nhow to use the language without a...\n\n01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.080\nI said I'd marry you, dude.\n\n01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.080\nDo you think that's like the rationalization\n\n01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.080\nof straight people who don't know\n\n01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.080\nany better, where it's just like, I don't,\n\n01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.080\nyou're the same, like, what do you use to do, right?\n\n01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.080\nWell, I don't think it's just the observation bias.\n\n01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.080\nI'll apologize for the generalization,\n\n01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.080\nI'm sorry, but\n\n01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.080\nit could be that one's more passive\n\n01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.080\nand one's more controlling,\n\n01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.080\nregardless of...\n\n01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.080\nNo matter what you say, Lizette, they're always going to just...\n\n01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.080\nRegardless of your gender, I'm just saying, you know,\n\n01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.080\nsome couples, I've met a lot of couples in my life,\n\n01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.080\nsome people are more passive,\n\n01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.080\nand of the two, one's more passive,\n\n01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.080\none could be more passive, one could be more\n\n01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:30.080\ncontrolling. I'll say could as\n\n01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.080\nnot to generalize.\n\n01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.080\nVersatile is the word.\n\n01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.080\nNot everybody is versatile, unfortunately,\n\n01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.080\nbut okay, sure, let's go with that.\n\n01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.080\nIt's almost as if these relationships\n\n01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.080\naren't defined by the sexualities\n\n01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.080\nof the parties. Exactly!\n\n01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.080\nYou're absolutely right.\n\n01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.080\nThat's why I apologize for the generalization,\n\n01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.080\nbut could it not be...\n\n01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.080\nCould it not be...\n\n01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.080\nWould it not be...\n\n01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.080\nWhat?\n\n01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.080\nYou're digging yourself a hole.\n\n01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.080\nWould it be a bad...\n\n01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.080\nOkay, if you're going to make your...\n\n01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.080\nWait a second, hold on.\n\n01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.080\nI think they want you to let it go.\n\n01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:14.080\nAll I wanted to say was that if you had...\n\n01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.080\nWhen Adam Goldberg is heckling you,\n\n01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.080\nthat is an indictment.\n\n01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:40.080\nAll right, let's play some D&D Spencer, shall we?\n\n01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.080\nI'd like to revisit the last topic.\n\n01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.080\nNo, no.\n\n01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.080\nLast time on Harmontown, D.\n\n01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.080\nAnd

01:12:50.080\nQuark got into the ogre's pants.\n\n01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.080\nA few more flaming bolts to the brainstem\n\n01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.080\nand the ogre was down.\n\n01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.080\nThat's pretty much it.\n\n01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.080\nAlright, thank you for that.\n\n01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.080\nSo yeah, you just killed that ogre.\n\n01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.080\nIs the gate still open right now?\n\n01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.080\nYeah, you've just killed the ogre\n\n01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.080\nand you stand at the open gate through the icy canyon.\n\n01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.080\nThere's some guards\n\n01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.080\nand demons remaining on this gate\n\n01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.080\nbut they're kind of up a few stories\n\n01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.080\ntall and it's open right now.\n\n01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.080\nDo they look like they're trying to stop us\n\n01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.080\nor are they like, oh shit, they killed an ogre.\n\n01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.080\nWe're not going to mess with them.\n\n01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.080\nThey look like they're off balance\n\n01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.080\nand as I'm speaking this is happening\n\n01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.080\nthey start to tumble and fall off the gate\n\n01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.080\nas it starts to swing wider open.\n\n01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.080\nBut now you see all these dudes\n\n01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.080\nkind of plummeting from the gate onto the icy floor\n\n01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.080\nand they're just hitting the ground.\n\n01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.080\nCrunch.\n\n01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.080\nSmash.\n\n01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.080\nSplat.\n\n01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:52.080\nNope, damn it.\n\n01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:54.080\nLet's go through the gate you guys.\n\n01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.080\nLet's do it.\n\n01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.080\nSkeleton army, hold.\n\n01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:00.080\nAlright.\n\n01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.080\nYou head forward.\n\n01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.080\nHave we lost any skeletons?\n\n01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.080\nDo we still have the full complement of skeletons?\n\n01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.080\nThey were kind of scarce in the ogre battle.\n\n01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.080\nI don't think you lost any.\n\n01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:12.080\nSo you're heading up this icy slope\n\n01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.080\nbeyond this gate\n\n01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.080\nand you can see at the top of the slope\n\n01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.080\nthe reflection of the sun is kind of\n\n01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.080\nblinding you and making it hard to see forward.\n\n01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.080\nBe blind now.\n\n01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.080\nWe're blind?\n\n01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.080\nNah, you just can't see very well.\n\n01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.080\nCan we have an estimation of how high it goes?\n\n01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.080\nIt's just into the abyss.\n\n01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.080\nYou would if you weren't so blinded.\n\n01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.080\nSon of a bitch.\n\n01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.080\nYeah.\n\n01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.080\nCan I send Avenger up\n\n01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.080\nas the weather quelled a little bit?\n\n01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.080\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.080\nAvenger, go straight up\n\n01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.080\nand spy.\n\n01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.080\nYou send Avenger straight up\n\n01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.080\nto spy.\n\n01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.080\nAnd after some time\n\n01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.080\nhe comes back.\n\n01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.080\nHe gives you a look that says\n\n01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.080\nI went up there and what I saw\n\n01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:02.080\nI can't really repeat except I can.\n\n01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.080\nIt was a bunch of demons.\n\n01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.080\nIt was like an army of demons\n\n01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.080\nand demonic creatures all standing outside\n\n01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.080\nthis big black fox who's the black keep.\n\n01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:12.080\nSee?\n\n01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.080\nIs your bird\n\n01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.080\nkind of a gangster\n\n01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.080\nfor like a...\n\n01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.080\nYeah.\n\n01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.080\nShit.\n\n01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.080\nAvenger saw a bunch of\n\n01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.080\nthere's an army of demons on the other side of this gate.\n\n01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.080\nHow many?\n\n01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.080\nAn army.\n\n01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.080\nAn army of demons.\n\n01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.080\nYep.\n\n01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.080\nOver 10, Avenger?\n\n01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.080\nOver 10.\n\n01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.080\nUnder 40?\n\n01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.080\nUnder 40.\n\n01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.080\nSo is this like the main black fortress\n\n01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.080\nwhere supposedly Animal Dark Star is?\n\n01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:48.080\nWho are you talking to?\n\n01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:50.080\nMy party members.\n\n01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.080\nYes.\n\n01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.080\nRight? Yeah.\n\n01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.080\nThis is the black keep, right?\n\n01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.080\nYeah.\n\n01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.080\nDo we have a large enough army?\n\n01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.080\nWe have us and 40 skeletons\n\n01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.080\nand if there's to be tons of them.\n\n01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.080\nLess than 40.\n\n01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.080\nLess than 40. More than 10.\n\n01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.080\nDoesn't seem like we're in a good position.\n\n01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.080\nWe can take them.\n\n01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.080\nMulrainee feels confident about this.\n\n01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.080\nI think we need someone in our party\n\n01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.080\nwho has the sexuality type\n\n01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.080\nto plan this attack.\n\n01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.080\nAnd the rest of us\n\n01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:24.080\ncould be a little more laid back about it.\n\n01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:30.080\nI'm not saying that the only woman\n\n01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:32.080\nshould be the one that plans the attack.\n\n01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.080\nI'm just saying that it tends to be the woman\n\n01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:36.080\nthat wants to plan attacks.\n\n01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.080\nI think it should be\n\n01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.080\nyou.\n\n01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.080\nOh, really?

Let the skeletons go in there first.\n\n01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:01.080\nOh, right.\n\n01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.080\nTyler's worried about Christopher.\n\n01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.080\nChristopher, what was it?\n\n01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.080\nNothing, no. I was like, yeah, you're right. Let's stay behind them.\n\n01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.080\nOkay, let's do it.\n\n01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.080\nSo we march behind our formation of skeletons.\n\n01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.080\nAll right, the sun's blinding, as I said.\n\n01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:16.080\nSo you can kind of see the skeletons crest over the hill.\n\n01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:18.080\nThey're ahead of you, right?\n\n01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.080\nYes, correct.\n\n01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.080\nYeah, they're ahead of you and you see them.\n\n01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.080\nThey go over the hill and they disappear.\n\n01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:26.080\nSo they're at the top of this place.\n\n01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:28.080\nAnd from far off, from farther away\n\n01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:30.080\nthan if you were closer, for instance,\n\n01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.080\nyou hear a voice.\n\n01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.080\nA voice.\n\n01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.080\nA familiar and chilling.\n\n01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.080\nI mean, not really chilling.\n\n01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.080\nVoice calls out.\n\n01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:45.080\nYou seek to lay siege to the Ziggurat, Mark II.\n\n01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:50.080\nWell, let's see if you can take care of my welcome party.\n\n01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:53.080\nTheir hospitality is...\n\n01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:56.080\nDietic!\n\n01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.080\nSee, that's PCP.\n\n01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:00.080\nYeah.\n\n01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:03.080\nTheir hospitality is...\n\n01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:08.080\nShall we say, less than hospitable?\n\n01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.080\nThat's the more clever version.\n\n01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.080\nYeah, I did a flurry right on it.\n\n01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.080\nWait, whose voice was that?\n\n01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.080\nThat's Emerald Darkstar, if...\n\n01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.080\nOh, shit, yeah.\n\n01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:22.080\nIf I know anything.\n\n01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:25.080\nI didn't hear a thing that was said because I was so dazzled by that.\n\n01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:28.080\nI love looking at Spencer's eyes while he does that voice.\n\n01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:30.080\nDid you see him vibrate?\n\n01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.080\nThey're just dead eyes.\n\n01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.080\nNo wonder he's so evil with a voice like that.\n\n01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.080\nYeah, he probably got teased a lot.\n\n01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:40.080\nWhat was the upshot of what he said?\n\n01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.080\nYou dare to assail the Ziggurat, Mark II.\n\n01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.080\nThat's the upshot?\n\n01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:50.080\nAnd here's a welcoming committee, but in air quotes.\n\n01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.080\nOkay.\n\n01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:56.080\nCan we send Avenger up there and have him flip off?\n\n01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.080\nPeople are like, let's go in there and let's do it.\n\n01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.080\nWe're going to march the skeletons.\n\n01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.080\nHe knows we're coming, that's why he said that stuff.\n\n01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.080\nOnward.\n\n01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:10.080\nSo as you crest the ill, you see all those demons that I was previously mentioning.\n\n01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:13.080\nLet's see about those demons I was previously mentioning.\n\n01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:19.080\nStanding in front of the black keep, blocking the ice road towards it,\n\n01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.080\nis a sizable demonic force.\n\n01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:27.080\nYou see about 30 of those sliming yellow oozy demons that I've mentioned in previous encounters.\n\n01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:31.080\nAs well as 10 tall skinny knights clad in black armor.\n\n01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:34.080\nYou also see two purple porco demons.\n\n01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:37.080\nThose are massive demonic porcupines.\n\n01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:43.080\nAs well as a massive red demon standing head and shoulders above the tallest of the dark knights.\n\n01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:47.080\nThey stand blocking the road, glaring at you as if daring you to challenge them.\n\n01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:50.080\nHowever, we don't seize your skeleton army.\n\n01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.080\nWhat?\n\n01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.080\nAw, great.\n\n01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.080\nThey just, they de-camped? What happened?\n\n01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:01.080\nWell, that's what happens when you send a force to some place you can't see.\n\n01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:02.080\nWe were right behind them.\n\n01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.080\nI mean, you were marching right behind them.\n\n01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.080\nYeah, now they're gone?\n\n01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.080\nYeah.\n\n01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:11.080\nI, I, I, I call out, you, you, you.\n\n01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.080\nSkeletons!\n\n01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:17.080\nThese skeletons aren't the most talkative, but yet you don't hear anything.\n\n01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.080\nI mean, and so you don't hear anything.\n\n01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.080\nFuck you and your teeth?\n\n01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.080\nNothing?\n\n01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:23.080\nNo.\n\n01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.080\nWait, so they're just gone?\n\n01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:29.080\nYou don't see them. I mean, so they would appear gone.\n\n01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.080\nMerage.\n\n01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.080\nAlright, well, we can,\n\n01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.080\nOh, you see, it might be like some sort of mirage kind of thing.\n\n01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.080\nYeah, well, we keep marching forward.\n\n01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.080\nI mean, yeah.\n\n01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:40.080\nYou feel the ice. Give way below your feet.\n\n01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.080\nYou plunge.\n\n01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:44.080\nShit, downward.\n\n01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:48.080\nI bet there's some skeletons down there.\n\n01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:51.080\nDo I get a balance check before I go tumbling to my death?\n\n01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.080\nNah, you more just kind of tumble.\n\n01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.080\nSon of a bitch.\n\n01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.080\nYeah.\n\n01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:59.080\nAs you will.\n\n01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:02.080\nJust watch Princess Bride this weekend.\n\n01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.080\nIt's a great movie.\n\n01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:04.080\nYeah.\n\n01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:08.080\nYou fall down, down, down through the icy floor and down, down, down,\n\n01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:13.080\nlanding in a dark, icy, cold place on a crunchy pile of bones.\n\n01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:18.080\nMan, Ted, Steve, Laquisha.\n\n01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.080\nNumber nine.\n\n01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.080\nYou notice you're all separated.\n\n01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.080\nYou don't see your friends.\n\n01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.080\nSo we're all alone?\n\n01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.080\nYou're all in separate rooms.\n\n01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.080\nQuark.\n\n01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.080\nSharpey.\n\n01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.080\nAll right.\n\n01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:37.080\nAh, Coco.\n\n01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.080\nChristenburg.\n\n01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.080\nYeah.\n\n01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:40.080\nQuark.\n\n01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.080\nCan we, Quark?\n\n01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.080\nCan we see each other?\n\n01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.080\nJust very, very faintly.\n\n01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:46.080\nYou can't see in the darkness, either.\n\n01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:48.080\nSo it's dark and there's bones around us?\n\n01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:49.080\nYeah.\n\n01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.080\nAre these presumably our skeleton army?\n\n01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:52.080\nYeah.\n\n01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.080\nOops.\n\n01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:58.080\nI take a bone and I wrap a part of my pantaloon.\n\n01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:03.080\nI rip part of my robe off real sexy-like.\n\n01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.080\nWrap it around a bone.\n\n01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:09.080\nFuck it, I just light a torch.\n\n01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:12.080\nI try to make a torch out of a bone for a while and then I just like,\n\n01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:16.080\nyou know what, they don't make them like they do at the store.\n\n01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.080\nYou're in a chamber.\n\n01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:21.080\nIt's a stone chamber except one of the walls is made of ice.\n\n01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:24.080\nThere's a hole in the ceiling presumably where you fell through.\n\n01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:29.080\nAnd then there's a big iron circular door before you.\n\n01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:32.080\nThat's all you see other than the skeletons.\n\n01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:34.080\nBefore all of us?\n\n01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:37.080\nI mean, yeah, that's what you all see, I guess.\n\n01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.080\nI have low light vision so I can see that too.\n\n01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.080\nI have goggles.\n\n01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.080\nOh yeah, the goggles of night.\n\n01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.080\nSo all the skeletons are just dead?\n\n01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:48.080\nNo, I mean they're not.\n\n01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:49.080\nOh.\n\n01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:50.080\nSkeletons.\n\n01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:52.080\nWell, they're undead.\n\n01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:55.080\nIs there any way to make them reassemble or is it just like, sorry?\n\n01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:58.080\nThat happens.\n\n01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:00.080\nHey, reassemble, skeletons.\n\n01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.080\nThat happens.\n\n01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.080\nWoo!\n\n01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:06.080\nI try to open my eyes.\n\n01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:08.080\nI try to open my door.\n\n01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.080\nHey, Quark!\n\n01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.080\nYeah?\n\n01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.080\nTell your skeletons that they're cool to get back up.\n\n01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.080\nHey, everybody get up.\n\n01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.080\nOh, they all get up.\n\n01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.080\nOkay.\n\n01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:26.080\nI say to my skeletons, looks like you hated it.\n\n01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:32.080\nI feel like I'd be like, why we got to fight like this if they said that?\n\n01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:37.080\nLike if that happened, if I was quicker on the uptake and that happened to me with a waiter,\n\n01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.080\nI'd be like, why you got to be like that?\n\n01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:40.080\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:41.080\nThere's no winning.\n\n01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.080\nYeah.\n\n01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:44.080\nWhat if you just hit him?\n\n01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.080\nThat'd be winning.\n\n01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:49.080\nBecause the day hit them, they had to wait on my table.\n\n01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.080\nThey're already bummed out.\n\n01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:54.080\nIt's a sad situation for everybody.\n\n01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:58.080\nWhat if you just stare at them and maintain unblinking eye contact?\n\n01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:03.080\nI mean, these are all just things like, I'm not going to condition.\n\n01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.080\nI'm saying like, they have to stop.\n\n01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:09.080\nWe can't come up with ways to make them miserable in response.\n\n01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.080\nIt's not miserable.\n\n01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:12.080\nJust make them go, maybe I shouldn't have said that.\n\n01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.080\nMaybe I should think about saying that in the future.\n\n01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:18.080\nMaybe I should become a better person in general.\n\n01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:21.080\nIf I can accomplish that with a stare, I've done something right.\n\n01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:24.080\nMaybe if I care enough about it, I'll bring literature.\n\n01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.080\nThat's like how they can opt out of saying that.\n\n01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.080\nLeave it on the table.\n\n01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:36.080\nJust so you know, you don't have to do a bit when you see crumbs on the plate.\n\n01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:38.080\nYou feel like they're calling you fat when they say that?\n\n01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.080\nNo, no, honestly, not.\n\n01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:43.080\nI just think it's like a tiny little example of how we just kind of had these habits that\n\n01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:47.080\nwere just kind of like, you know, just catch phrases and got milks, too much\n\n01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.080\ninformation and things.\n\n01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:53.080\nBut that's an example of one that kind of like, in that tiny little split second\n\n01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:56.080\nmoment, just like confusion and anxiety happen.\n\n01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.080\nNever happiness, ever.\n\n01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:00.080\nYeah.\n\n01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.080\nYeah.\n\n01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:04.080\nBut sometimes also you're talking to somebody who kind of feels bad that they've\n\n01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:07.080\njust mowed down a fucking bucket of chicken.\n\n01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:10.080\nYou know, there's that, too, I guess.\n\n01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.080\nThere aren't even bowens left on the plate.\n\n01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:16.080\nYou must have hated it.\n\n01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:20.080\nWhat restaurant are you going to where you eat a bucket of chicken?\n\n01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.080\nWhat are you like?\n\n01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.080\nThis is like a Comic-Con panel.\n\n01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.080\nYou're just going to catch me in a...\n\n01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:30.080\nHow's the kutcher?\n\n01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:31.080\nAll right.\n\n01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.080\nSo one of the doors, walls is made of ice, right?\n\n01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:34.080\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:36.080\nYou were opening a door, right?\n\n01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.080\nYeah, I tried to open the door.\n\n01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.080\nYeah.\n\n01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.080\nSo you open the iron door and it swings forth.\n\n01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:46.080\nAnd inside you see a large gray skinned humanoid creature with blazing eyes and large\n\n01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:48.080\nram's horns.\n\n01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:54.080\nHe gives a mighty do-raw roar and then closes the door.\n\n01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:59.080\nOh, you found the men's room.\n\n01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.080\nI wouldn't go in there if I were you.\n\n01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.080\nCan I try opening my door?\n\n01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.080\nYeah.\n\n01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.080\nIs it the same guy?\n\n01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.080\nNo.\n\n01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:14.080\nThis door opens into a larger icy chamber and flitting around said icy chamber is a\n\n01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:20.080\nsmall blue imp flying around on bat wings as a whole.\n\n01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:21.080\nOkay.\n\n01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:22.080\nYeah.\n\n01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:26.080\nBehind him you can see a staircase going upwards.\n\n01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:27.080\nOkay.\n\n01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:28.080\nI yell at the imp.\n\n01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.080\nI'm like, hey!\n\n01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.080\nWhy are we?\n\n01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.080\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.080\nStop that.\n\n01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.080\nCome here.\n\n01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.080\nTalk to me.\n\n01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.080\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.080\nYou guys can hear that faintly.\n\n01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.080\nOkay.\n\n01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.080\nIt doesn't respond to you though.\n\n01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.080\nIs that you, Christopher?\n\n01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:42.080\nYeah, there's this blue shithead flying around in this room.\n\n01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:43.080\nI don't know what he's doing.\n\n01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:46.080\nThere's a big horn-faced guy outside my door.\n\n01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:48.080\nHe looks like an asshole.\n\n01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.080\nI'm just hanging out.\n\n01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.080\nThis sucks, you guys!\n\n01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:53.080\nOpen your door and see what's out there, Malrain and Sharpie.\n\n01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.080\nMay I open my door?\n\n01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:56.080\nYou may.\n\n01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:59.080\nI would like to open the door.\n\n01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:00.080\nOkay.\n\n01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.080\nYou open the door and it swings open.\n\n01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:08.080\nInside you can see a horrendous assortment of rusted metal blades on rusted metal poles.\n\n01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:13.080\nAs the door opens, you hear a clacking as the metallic limbs begin to move and sputter.\n\n01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:18.080\nAnd several of them fly out of the door, lunging at you.\n\n01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:21.080\nMay I use my...\n\n01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.080\nPerfect step.\n\n01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:30.080\nMay I use my flaming armor to melt the metal?\n\n01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:36.080\nYeah, so these limbs kind of lunge out, but they miss you as you activate.\n\n01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:38.080\nDid I miss something awesome?\n\n01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:44.080\nSomeone said, use your perfect skin to open the door.\n\n01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.080\nThat's pretty good.\n\n01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:55.080\nAnyway, yeah, and then you activate your flaming armor and it starts to kind of melt these things a little bit.\n\n01:28:55.080 --> 01:29:02.080\nNot melt so much as make them red hot, but it's kind of inflicting some sort of, I mean, melting.\n\n01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:04.080\nIt's definitely increasing the temperature.\n\n01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.080\nLet's say that.\n\n01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.080\nYou almost set damage.\n\n01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.080\nAlmost.\n\n01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:10.080\nOh, it's doing damage too.\n\n01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:12.080\nBut only eight.\n\n01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.080\nNot bad for it doing nothing.\n\n01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:17.080\nWell, I mean, it didn't do nothing. It did eight damage.\n\n01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.080\nSharpie, what's outside your door?\n\n01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.080\nDid you see any of the stuff on the walls too?\n\n01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.080\nThe walls are made of ice.\n\n01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:26.080\nLike, the other walls are made of stone except for these ice walls.\n\n01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.080\nOkay, I go up to my door.\n\n01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:30.080\nI'm just going to give it a little open.\n\n01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.080\nYou know what?\n\n01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:33.080\nA big open.\n\n01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:38.080\nIt swings open and reveals several frozen, intact corpses.\n\n01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.080\nThey look like adventurers.\n\n01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:42.080\nTheir bodies are adorned in fine items and equipments.\n\n01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:44.080\nJackpot.\n\n01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:46.080\nAnd, of course, a tragedy.\n\n01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:56.080\nWhat kind of fine items do I just procure them?\n\n01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.080\nSure.\n\n01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:03.080\nYou procure four cloaks of resistance, four rings of protection, two boots of wintry might,\n\n01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:06.080\nand a patch of pigeon apache.\n\n01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:09.080\nTwo boots of spry springing, one rod of frost.\n\n01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:11.080\nWait, I want that one. Dibs on that one instead.\n\n01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:15.080\nOne mighty greatsword, one whisper bow, and one assassin's ribbon-decker.\n\n01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:16.080\nWell, I want that one. I want that one.\n\n01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:18.080\nRibbon-decker.\n\n01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:20.080\nIs it rechargeable?\n\n01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:24.080\nGuys, I found a bunch of shit!\n\n01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:27.080\nHey, I want dibs on some of that.\n\n01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:30.080\nI got a big horn guy outside my door.\n\n01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:33.080\nI don't care. I got a dagger. Fuck you.\n\n01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:35.080\nWait, wow, wow.\n\n01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:37.080\nYou don't have a dagger.\n\n01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.080\nAre we connected?\n\n01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.080\nSoon.\n\n01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:40.080\nHe has a mall. We have to get to him.\n\n01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:41.080\nYeah.\n\n01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:46.080\nAre we connected? Are these ice walls the things that are keeping us from each other?\n\n01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.080\nWho knows, man?\n\n01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:53.080\nI take my flaming sword and I start slicing at the wall from the direction where I hear\n\n01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.080\nmy friend's voices coming from.\n\n01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.080\nYou see, Chris de Burgh.\n\n01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:57.080\nHey!\n\n01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:59.080\nI'm just kidding. I didn't really mean to fuck you.\n\n01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:00.080\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.080\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:02.080\nHow's your dagger?\n\n01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:03.080\nI don't have it yet.\n\n01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:06.080\nI keep slicing through the walls until we find...\n\n01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:07.080\nMulraine. Mulraine.\n\n01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:08.080\nHey!\n\n01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.080\nOh my god!\n\n01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:10.080\nOh my god!\n\n01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:11.080\nOh my god!\n\n01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.080\nOh my god!\n\n01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.080\nOh my god!\n\n01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:16.080\nTotally fell!\n\n01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.080\nMulraine, you look great.\n\n01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:22.080\nYou look great.

I learned it from watching you.\n\n01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:34.080\nI keep slicing until it gets to Sharpie.\n\n01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:35.080\nSharpie!\n\n01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:36.080\nSharpie, oh my

01:31:51.080\nThere's boots of shimmering, knives of plucking.\n\n01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:53.080\nThere are capes of resistance.\n\n01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:54.080\nCapes of resistance?\n\n01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:56.080\nDo they have any boots in my size?\n\n01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:57.080\nI'm a size nine.\n\n01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:58.080\nI think so.\n\n01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.080\nOkay, nice.\n\n01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.080\nWhoa, they do.\n\n01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.080\nYay!\n\n01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:02.080\nThat's so convenient.\n\n01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.080\nWhat are the things we can all share?\n\n01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:06.080\nThere's four of a few things, right?\n\n01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:09.080\nThere's four cloaks of resistance and four rings of protection.\n\n01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:10.080\nThree?\n\n01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:12.080\nResistance, resistance what?\n\n01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:14.080\nI mean, stuff.\n\n01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:17.080\nIt gives you a bonus on your saving throws.\n\n01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:18.080\nVersus?\n\n01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.080\nFun rules.\n\n01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:21.080\nAnd what were the weapons?\n\n01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:22.080\nWhat?\n\n01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.080\nOh, weapons.\n\n01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:29.080\nMighty Greatsword, Whisperbow, Ribbon Dagger, and a Rot of Frost.\n\n01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.080\nThat sounds like one for each of us.\n\n01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:32.080\nOh, damn.\n\n01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:33.080\nI'll do the Rot of Frost.\n\n01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.080\nWeird.\n\n01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:37.080\nMulraine probably Whisperbow, right?\n\n01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.080\nProbably.\n\n01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.080\nYeah, sure.\n\n01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.080\nI have a question about this Ribbon Dagger.\n\n01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:45.080\nDoes it have a long ribbon attached to it in which maybe I could throw it and take it back?\n\n01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:47.080\nYeah, that's exactly it.\n\n01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:50.080\nOh, my God.\n\n01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:54.080\nScarecrow got a brain.\n\n01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:57.080\nChristopher got a knife with a rope pre-tied to it.\n\n01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:58.080\nAll right.\n\n01:32:58.080 --> 01:32:59.080\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.080\nAnd what's the Rot of Frost?\n\n01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:02.080\nIs that mine?\n\n01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:04.080\nI would believe that would be mine.\n\n01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:05.080\nWhat do I get?\n\n01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.080\nYou get the sword.\n\n01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:07.080\nMighty Greatsword.\n\n01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:08.080\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.080\nTell me about the Mighty Greatsword.\n\n01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.080\nIt's super mighty.\n\n01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:14.080\nHey, guys, I got a Mighty Sword.\n\n01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.080\nThat's adorable.\n\n01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:16.080\nThank you.\n\n01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:19.080\nIt's, like, bigger than the last one.\n\n01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:20.080\nAll right.\n\n01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:21.080\nTake it.\n\n01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.080\nPretty.\n\n01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.080\nHow much larger is it than him now?\n\n01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:26.080\nLike, let's see.\n\n01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:29.080\nThe last one was roughly 25% longer than him.\n\n01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:33.080\nI would say this one's at least 35% longer than him.\n\n01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:38.080\nI'd say if you're, like, 3 foot 3 inches, then this one would have to be, you know...\n\n01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.080\nDo the math.\n\n01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:43.080\nFour foot 2 inches.\n\n01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:44.080\nAll right.\n\n01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:48.080\nThere are ways people can bookmark this part of the podcast, so they can just\n\n01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:51.080\nskip right to it.\n\n01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:54.080\nI don't know if that technology exists, but...\n\n01:33:54.080 --> 01:34:02.080\nAll right, if we have to invent it, could I suggest for a name, uh, highlightfinder?\n\n01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:05.080\nThrillseeker.\n\n01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:06.080\nThat's...\n\n01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:08.080\nAll right.\n\n01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:10.080\nAnd about my rod of.\n\n01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:11.080\nof...\n\n01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.080\nof...\n\n01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:18.720\nsense that it cast cold spells, it would take like a day to study it, but once that\n\n01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:22.480\nday's over, who boy?\n\n01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:27.560\nAnd these cloaks of resistance can be donned without me having to choose to take off anything\n\n01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:28.560\nelse, right?\n\n01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:30.680\nLike I just have my wizardly robes.\n\n01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:38.040\nYou got, yeah, I mean, you have a cape, like your dad's cape, I think those kind are in\n\n01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.600\nthe same place.\n\n01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.960\nCan you wear two capes?\n\n01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:45.640\nI mean, oh, my dad's cape is like it's like a teleportation cape.\n\n01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:46.640\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.600\nIt's just not charged or.\n\n01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:53.800\nNo, it recharges once per day and you used it, tried to use it twice per day and forgot\n\n01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:54.800\nabout it.\n\n01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:59.120\nWhat, you had a teleportation cape at that time?\n\n01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:01.280\nIn my defense, I finally remembered I had a bird.\n\n01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:04.080\nHow about you grab us all and teleport out of this hole?\n\n01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.160\nEverybody go through your shit, like this, let's all take inventory real quick.\n\n01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:11.880\nWait, you had a teleportation cape this whole time?\n\n01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:12.880\nYes, Lizette.\n\n01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:18.040\nDon't you also have a staff that grows so you can climb out on it?\n\n01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:19.040\nYeah.\n\n01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.040\nOkay.\n\n01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:22.720\nHey, Dan, you're holding out on us, man.\n\n01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:25.080\nI mean, Sharpie.\n\n01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:28.560\nCan I remind you guys that the reason you found all this shit is because I forgot I had all\n\n01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:29.560\nthat stuff.\n\n01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:33.920\nWhat are you going to say next time?\n\n01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:39.880\nIf we hadn't gotten our asses kicked all five times before now, we wouldn't even be here.\n\n01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:41.880\nIt's called the butterfly theory effect.\n\n01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:42.880\nLook it up.\n\n01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:43.880\nI don't know.\n\n01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:44.880\nI like the way you guys are looking at me.\n\n01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:45.880\nHey, that was an Ashton Kutcher movie.\n\n01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:46.880\nYeah, Ashton Kutcher reference.\n\n01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.880\nThere you go.\n\n01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:48.880\nAll right.\n\n01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:56.440\nI want to take that climbing rod that I have that should we get out of here over to beneath\n\n01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:58.000\nthe hole that I fell through?\n\n01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000\nYeah.\n\n01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000\nWait, but that doesn't leave our skeleton behind.\n\n01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000\nThere's a staircase behind the blue.\n\n01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.320\nShould we check this out before we go?\n\n01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:04.320\nWe need our skeletons anyway.\n\n01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.320\nWe can't.\n\n01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.320\nWe have them.\n\n01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:07.320\nOkay.\n\n01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.320\nWe told them to get up.\n\n01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:09.320\nWe rally our skeletons.\n\n01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:12.320\nWe walk through Chris de Burgh's door towards the blue staircase.\n\n01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:13.320\nYeah.\n\n01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:14.320\nIt's like the least threatening.\n\n01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.320\nYeah.\n\n01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.320\nYeah.\n\n01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.320\nWhat happens?\n\n01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:19.840\nOh, that's me.\n\n01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:23.600\nI walk into the room with the blue, but I say, hey, shithead, I brought my friends.\n\n01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:24.600\nCome on.\n\n01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:25.600\nYeah.\n\n01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:29.680\nSo he's still flitting around on those bat wings, still on the other side of the chamber\n\n01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:30.680\nis that staircase.\n\n01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:31.680\nAs I mentioned.\n\n01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:32.680\nGod damn it.\n\n01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:35.320\nHe's spinning around like a top and midair.\n\n01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:41.240\nIt causes a rapid wind to whip up and it starts blowing around the room.\n\n01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:45.760\nSoon chunks of ice and snow are beginning to be lifted up off the floor and the walls.\n\n01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:49.280\nThey're pulling off the walls and they're flying towards the demon and casing them in\n\n01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:54.280\nice and snow that keeps building up and building up until it looks like a giant snowflake\n\n01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:57.440\nfloating around the air.\n\n01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:58.840\nWe should kill that thing.\n\n01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:01.400\nYou said it was putting it.\n\n01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:02.400\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.400\nYeah.\n\n01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:04.400\nYou referenced the demon.\n\n01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.400\nYeah.\n\n01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:06.680\nSo there's this blue imp demon.\n\n01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:07.680\nOh, okay.\n\n01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:08.680\nIt's a thing.\n\n01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:09.680\nOkay.\n\n01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:10.680\nI see.\n\n01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:11.680\nSo he's sucking in elements and turning into this other thing.\n\n01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:12.680\nNow he's a snowflake.\n\n01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:13.680\nYeah.\n\n01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:14.680\nNow he's a giant snowflake.\n\n01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:15.680\nHold on.\n\n01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.680\nLike non-conflict resolution for a moment.\n\n01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:18.680\nOkay.\n\n01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:19.680\nOkay.\n\n01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:20.680\nI tried.\n\n01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:21.680\nHe didn't listen to me.\n\n01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:22.680\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:23.680\nWe all know.\n\n01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:24.680\nI saw the subreddit.\n\n01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:25.680\nEveryone jacking you off.\n\n01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.680\nYou're the best D&D player in the world.\n\n01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:27.680\nYou did very well.\n\n01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:28.680\nSorry.\n\n01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:29.680\nI try to do more terrible.\n\n01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:32.480\nAm I trying to show you up there?\n\n01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:33.800\nI'm expressing my jealousy.\n\n01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:34.800\nI'm just saying.\n\n01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:35.800\nI love you.\n\n01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:47.240\nI kneel in front of the snowflake and I say in three different languages, hello.\n\n01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:52.440\nThat's how you do it, Tyler.\n\n01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:53.440\nWait.\n\n01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:54.640\nDoes one of us have, one of us, amelot of frost.\n\n01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:55.640\nThat's one of us.\n\n01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:56.640\nMe.\n\n01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:57.640\nYou.\n\n01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:58.640\nMaybe you can like stop it.\n\n01:37:58.640 --> 01:37:59.640\nYou can control the ice.\n\n01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:01.640\nCan you stop this terrible thing from happening?\n\n01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:04.280\nI can calm and intensify hail, sleet and snow.\n\n01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:07.080\nYou can calm this piece of thing before it kills us.\n\n01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:08.640\nLet's see what happens with his hello.\n\n01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:10.320\nWe'll go first.\n\n01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:15.640\nYou see a central spot in the middle of the snowflake, kind of glue blue.\n\n01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:16.640\nYeah.\n\n01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:17.640\nYeah.\n\n01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:21.120\nThat means hello back.\n\n01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:22.120\nWho knows, man?\n\n01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:23.120\nYou don't speak so much.\n\n01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:29.280\nAmelot of winter to calm this thing.\n\n01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.960\nIt's flown in the air.\n\n01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:34.760\nYou use your amulet and it continues to float in the air.\n\n01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:39.880\nI say to it, I don't know if you can communicate with us, but I'm making the assumption that\n\n01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:46.080\nyou, like us, are prisoners in this dungeon, that you ran afoul of Admiral Darkstar and\n\n01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:50.720\nthat you might be able to help us defeat him.\n\n01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:56.520\nIt's the central spot and it's a, you know, center of mass kind of turns red and it starts\n\n01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.400\nspinning around like a saw blade.\n\n01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:04.720\nAll right, I guess, let's kill it.\n\n01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:05.720\nYeah.\n\n01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:06.720\nKrista Burke.\n\n01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:07.720\nYeah, let's kill it.\n\n01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:09.240\nUse that ribbon thing you got.\n\n01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:10.240\nOh yeah.\n\n01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:15.240\nI want to, can I throw my dagger at it with the ribbon on it?\n\n01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:16.240\nI want to use the ribbon dagger.\n\n01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:17.240\nOkay.\n\n01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:18.240\nJust, yeah.\n\n01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:20.200\nUse that ribbon dagger.\n\n01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:22.240\nYou've never used one of these before.\n\n01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.240\nOkay.\n\n01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:28.800\nSo you're not, you're not the, the most experienced, shittier versions of that before.\n\n01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:29.800\nYeah.\n\n01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:30.800\nI'm all over it.\n\n01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:31.800\nIt's fun.\n\n01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:32.800\nThey got different weights.\n\n01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.320\nThat's how this stuff works.\n\n01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.920\nAnyway, it does hit him.\n\n01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:37.920\nFor anyone wondering.\n\n01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:40.920\nCan I pull it back?\n\n01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.560\nYeah, yeah, that happens.\n\n01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:43.800\nI want to do that.\n\n01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:45.800\nYou deal one damage.\n\n01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:46.800\nYeah.\n\n01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.800\nSuck it, nerd.\n\n01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:53.720\nMighty far sword attack.\n\n01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:56.200\nI think you have your far sword for the day used up.\n\n01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:57.200\nOh shit.\n\n01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.200\nYeah.\n\n01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:59.200\nYeah.\n\n01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:04.520\nLet's just, I take out my, is it floating in the air above me?\n\n01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:05.520\nYeah.\n\n01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.520\nYou might be able to jump up there, but it'll be a bit of an exertion.\n\n01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:08.520\nYou want a boost?\n\n01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:09.520\nYeah.\n\n01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:14.720\nI get on top of Krista Burke's shoulders and we run like a chicken fight.\n\n01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:21.640\nI go in there wielding my new sword and say, take a piece of this, snowflake.\n\n01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:28.520\nI heard you're not the same as all of your counterparts, but the pain I inflict will\n\n01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:29.520\nbe identical.\n\n01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:33.520\nI give a thumbs up to Sharpie.\n\n01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:34.520\nI'm workshopping it.\n\n01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:35.520\nI'm workshopping it.\n\n01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:40.360\nBy the time I get there, have the joke punched up.\n\n01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:47.360\nI throw my, my snowflake related quips to a room, a writer's room.\n\n01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:53.000\nYour clips get workshopped as you're given this thumbs up that kind of throws off your\n\n01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.600\nchicken stack of adventurers balance and you just kind of topple to the ground.\n\n01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:01.640\nIt's hard to balance and thumbs up and stab people.\n\n01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:02.640\nOkay.\n\n01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:03.640\nI run back and regroup.\n\n01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:04.640\nYeah.\n\n01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:05.640\nOh shit.\n\n01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:06.640\nOkay.\n\n01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:07.640\nMay I do something?\n\n01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.640\nYep.\n\n01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:09.640\nYeah.\n\n01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:10.640\nYou want to throw arrows at the snowflake?\n\n01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:11.640\nYeah.\n\n01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:12.640\nYou don't want to throw arrows.\n\n01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:13.640\nThat's a bad idea.\n\n01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:14.640\nUse your bow.\n\n01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:15.640\nUse your new bow.\n\n01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:16.640\nWait.\n\n01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:17.640\nWait.\n\n01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:18.640\nYou don't know what it is yet.\n\n01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:19.640\nWhisper bow.\n\n01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:20.640\nYeah.\n\n01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:21.640\nYeah.\n\n01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:22.640\nYou should try your new bow.\n\n01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:23.640\nWhy are we whispering?\n\n01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:24.640\nI don't want to talk about it.\n\n01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:25.640\nI can't hear what's happening.\n\n01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:33.520\nMay I use my whisper bow to throw three fire arrows at the snowflake?\n\n01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.640\nYour whisper bow can only fire two arrows.\n\n01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:36.640\nThat's fine.\n\n01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:37.640\nI'm not, I'm not picky.\n\n01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:38.640\nYou want to make them flaming arrows?\n\n01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:39.640\nYes, please.\n\n01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:40.640\nYes.\n\n01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:50.640\nOne of your arrows strikes, hitting its mark, mark being the snowflake in this instance.\n\n01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:54.640\nIt deals seven damage.\n\n01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:55.640\nNice.\n\n01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:56.640\nAll right.\n\n01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:57.640\nYeah.\n\n01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:00.640\nYou see some of the ice kind of melt and drip off onto the floor.\n\n01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:05.640\nThat's what fire does to ice.\n\n01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:06.640\nSharpie.\n\n01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:07.640\nScorching ray.\n\n01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:15.640\nIt strikes directly in its center of mass in that glowing red eyeball part I was mentioning.\n\n01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:16.640\nSweet.\n\n01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:19.640\nAnd it deals 13 damage.\n\n01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:20.640\nYes.\n\n01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:21.640\nAll right.\n\n01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:27.920\nIt continues its rapid spinning and it kind of spins around the whole room, attempting\n\n01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:31.640\nto slice into your torso slash midsections.\n\n01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:36.640\nI mean, what did you expect?\n\n01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.640\nNot that.\n\n01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:41.640\nI tried to make friends with it.\n\n01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:43.640\nI don't even know.\n\n01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:48.640\nSo Mulraine and Christopher each get struck.\n\n01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:49.640\nNo.\n\n01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:55.640\nAnd they each take, well, Christopher takes 12 damage.\n\n01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:57.640\nAnd Mulraine takes six.\n\n01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:58.640\nOh, fuck.\n\n01:42:58.640 --> 01:42:59.640\nDirty eyes.\n\n01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:00.640\nThis isn't, it's fine.\n\n01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:01.640\nIt's fine.\n\n01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:02.640\nYou're all cut up.\n\n01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:03.640\nThat's your fault.\n\n01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:04.640\nYeah.\n\n01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:05.640\nI've got to, I've listened.\n\n01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:06.640\nTry the ribbon dagger again.\n\n01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.640\nYou're getting good at it.\n\n01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:09.640\nIt did one damage.\n\n01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:10.640\nThis doesn't seem like.\n\n01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:11.640\nYou're getting good at it.\n\n01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:12.640\nIt's like a slap machine.\n\n01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:13.640\nIt's going to pay off now.\n\n01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:16.640\nYou got it warmed up.\n\n01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:17.640\nThis is the worst idea.\n\n01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:18.640\nYeah.\n\n01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:19.640\nLet's just do the ribbon dagger again.\n\n01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:20.640\nWhy not?\n\n01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:21.640\nWhat could go wrong?\n\n01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:22.640\nCritical hit.\n\n01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:23.640\nFine.\n\n01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:29.640\nWhatever, you guys, whatever.\n\n01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:31.640\nDealing four damage.\n\n01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:32.640\nYeah.\n\n01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:38.640\nWe use the term critical loosely here.\n\n01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:40.640\nIs that me?\n\n01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:42.640\nI put it at you.\n\n01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:43.640\nOkay.\n\n01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:44.640\nI get back on Christopher shoulders.\n\n01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:45.640\nI go, let's try this again.\n\n01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:46.640\nOne more time.\n\n01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:47.640\nAll right.\n\n01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:48.640\nWhat's my line?\n\n01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.640\nI need a snowflake line.\n\n01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:50.640\nOh, shit.\n\n01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:51.640\nChill out.\n\n01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:52.640\nChill out.\n\n01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:53.640\nOkay.\n\n01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:54.640\nI get on.\n\n01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:55.640\nThank you.\n\n01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:58.640\nI get on Christopher shoulders and I take out my flaming sword and I kind of spur him\n\n01:43:58.640 --> 01:43:59.640\nlike he's a horse.\n\n01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:00.640\nDon't fuck.\n\n01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:01.640\nWhy?\n\n01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:02.640\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:04.640\nIt's lightly, you know.\n\n01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:05.640\nShit.\n\n01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:06.640\nI'm running.\n\n01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:07.640\nSorry.\n\n01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:10.640\nWe start running at him and I say, chill out.\n\n01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:12.640\nAn attack with my flaming sword.\n\n01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:17.640\nYour attack hits, or, I don't know.\n\n01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:19.640\nI'll leave.\n\n01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:20.640\nWow.\n\n01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:21.640\nYeah.\n\n01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:26.640\nYour attack lands a lot better than your bad pun.\n\n01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:30.640\nOr your delivery.\n\n01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:33.640\nOr my execution of that attempt of joked.\n\n01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:35.640\nOr that execution.\n\n01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:37.640\nDealing 14 damage.\n\n01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:38.640\n14.\n\n01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:39.640\nYeah.\n\n01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:40.640\nYeah.\n\n01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:47.640\nYou see a chunk of ice kind of fall off of his body and I get snowflake into the ground.\n\n01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.640\nHmm.\n\n01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:49.640\nYeah.\n\n01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:50.640\nSo this is if it's made of ice.\n\n01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:51.640\nHow much of it is left?\n\n01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:52.640\nMost of it.\n\n01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:53.640\nShit.\n\n01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:59.640\nI say, as I keep writing on Christopher and as I look back with my sword in the air, I\n\n01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:04.640\nwelcome to melt down.\n\n01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:08.640\nI throw him onto the ground.\n\n01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.640\nI like that one.\n\n01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:13.640\nPutting it at Mulraine's turn.\n\n01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:15.640\nCan I try to talk to this snowflake?\n\n01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:16.640\nYeah.\n\n01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:19.640\nWe've already determined that communication has failed.\n\n01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:21.640\nAt least Dan, Dan trying to talk to his fail.\n\n01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:22.640\nI don't know.\n\n01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:23.640\nYeah, that's a really weird.\n\n01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:25.640\nCan I try speaking it in elf?\n\n01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:26.640\nYeah.\n\n01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:27.640\nMaybe it's an elvish snowflake.\n\n01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:28.640\nYeah, go for it.\n\n01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:29.640\nSay an elf.\n\n01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:30.640\nCan you tell it?\n\n01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:31.640\nCan you tell?\n\n01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:32.640\nCan you tell?\n\n01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:33.640\nWhat?\n\n01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:36.640\nCan you please tell the snowflake?\n\n01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:37.640\nI think it's very pretty.\n\n01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:42.640\nAs you begin speaking in elven, the snowflake doesn't respond.\n\n01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:45.640\nThe whisper bow, however, does and you can see there's runes on its surface.\n\n01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:46.640\nYou couldn't notice before.\n\n01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:52.640\nThey're beginning to glow and light up as you respond to your elven speech.\n\n01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:54.640\nIn your face, Christopher.\n\n01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:55.640\nWhatever.\n\n01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:58.640\nThe snowflake is an elvish.\n\n01:45:58.640 --> 01:45:59.640\nThat was my...\n\n01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:03.640\nThere's kind of a new will they won't they kind of element going on here.\n\n01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:04.640\nYeah.\n\n01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:07.640\nIt's kind of a weird salmon, Diane, sexual attention here.\n\n01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:11.640\nI think the gay people in the audience want to know in this relationship who would be...\n\n01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:14.640\nWho would plan the wedding?\n\n01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:16.640\nHe certainly dresses better than I do.\n\n01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:17.640\nI don't know.\n\n01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:23.640\nIt's touching to barrel that call back.\n\n01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:25.640\nIt's still your turn though.\n\n01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:29.640\nYou're just talking an elvish so that doesn't take up a turn.\n\n01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:34.640\nWhisper to your bow and elven and make its arrows fly true.\n\n01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:37.640\nMay I use one more arrow to...\n\n01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:38.640\nYou can shoot too.\n\n01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:39.640\nIt's a new turn.\n\n01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:40.640\nOh, great.\n\n01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:43.640\nTwo new arrow flaming arrows on my whisper bow, please.\n\n01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:44.640\nYeah.\n\n01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.640\nYou fired the flaming arrows from your whisper bow.\n\n01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:54.640\nBoth of them strike their mark, plunging deep into the snowflake.\n\n01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:56.640\nWe're fighting a snowflake.\n\n01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:58.640\nYeah, you are.\n\n01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:08.640\nDealing 33 damage.\n\n01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:14.640\nYou should talk to your bow more.\n\n01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:18.640\nClearly, that was what did it, talking to your bow.\n\n01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:19.640\nYeah, you're right.\n\n01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:20.640\nI got this.\n\n01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:25.640\nThey strike into the snowflake and it bursts into flame and kind of melts and you see a\n\n01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:28.640\ncharred imp kind of plop to the floor.\n\n01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:29.640\nYeah.\n\n01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:33.640\nThen your bow kind of fades in color, like goes back to normal.\n\n01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:39.640\nI walk up to the imp and I say, I used to fuck you.\n\n01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:42.640\nI used to fuck you?\n\n01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:45.640\nYeah, I didn't want to say I used to see you because we already saw him.\n\n01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:46.640\nI used to meet you.\n\n01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:47.640\nI used to beat you.\n\n01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:48.640\nI used to beat you.\n\n01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:49.640\nI used to beat you.\n\n01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:50.640\nI used to beat you.\n\n01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.640\nI used to beat you.\n\n01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.640\nThank you for coming to Harmontown.\n\n01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:56.640\nI used to beat you.\n\n01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:58.640\nI used to beat all of you.\n\n01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:01.640\nOne more time for Tyler and Lisette, everybody.\n\n01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:02.640\nThank you, Tyler.\n\n01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:03.640\nThank you, Lisette.\n\n01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:08.640\nSpencer Crittenden.\n\n01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:10.640\nThank you, sir.\n\n01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:11.640\nI'm Jeff Davis.\n\n01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:14.640\nOne more time for your mayor, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:17.640\nShout out to Spencer's mom who's also here.\n\n01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:19.640\nSpencer's mom is here.\n\n01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:24.640\nSpencer's mom's here.\n\n01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:26.640\nYeah, I love Spencer's mom.\n\n01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:28.640\nThank you all.\n\n01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:29.640\nWe love you.\n\n01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:41.640\nGood night.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.002s"],"str_size":[169397]}
