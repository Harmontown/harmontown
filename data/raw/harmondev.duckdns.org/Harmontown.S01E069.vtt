00:00.000 --> 00:28.720
It is my duty, my privilege to announce that Harmontown is now in session.

00:28.720 --> 00:39.720
Once you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:39.720 --> 00:41.720
Hello.

00:41.720 --> 00:57.160
It's watching a G.I. Joe cartoon over the weekend, Jeff, for the classic from the 80s.

00:57.160 --> 01:08.000
And there's an episode of G.I. Joe in which Cobra, the Joes are transported to a terrible

01:08.000 --> 01:11.800
new dimension in a cosmic mix-up.

01:11.800 --> 01:16.000
They are transported to a world where Cobra is in charge.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.080
They have taken over the government of the world.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.960
It's Cobra world.

01:21.960 --> 01:33.800
And for instance when you buy something, they figure this out very slowly because the differences

01:33.800 --> 01:36.880
are very subtle, which I found profound.

01:36.880 --> 01:40.640
For instance they go and buy a pack of gum and there's like a Cobra scanner that comes

01:40.640 --> 01:46.160
down and scans your retina to make sure you can buy the gum right and that you're loyal

01:46.160 --> 01:47.160
to Cobra.

01:47.160 --> 01:50.200
And there's a lot of posters on the wall that are a picture of Cobra Commander that says

01:50.200 --> 01:59.200
loyalty to Cobra or else exclamation point, which is totally on the very Woody Allen approach

01:59.200 --> 02:00.200
to despotism.

02:00.200 --> 02:04.040
It's like a heart on the sleeve kind of.

02:04.040 --> 02:09.040
But the most interesting thing I thought about Cobra world is they're flying around, they're

02:09.040 --> 02:12.520
going, my God, will you look at the White House that has a little Cobra on top of it?

02:12.520 --> 02:18.080
Oh no, look at the Washington Monument, it's got a little Cobra on top of it.

02:18.080 --> 02:26.960
And then they go past Mount Rushmore and my God, Jeff, Mount Rushmore had some of its

02:26.960 --> 02:29.960
faces replaced.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.960
Some.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.120
Not Teddy Roosevelt.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.120
Not Teddy.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.120
Yes.

02:35.120 --> 02:41.080
Teddy Roosevelt's face replaced with Destro and then I guess Jefferson replaced with Cobra

02:41.080 --> 02:42.080
Commander.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.080
I can't remember.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.080
By the way, not famous for his face.

02:44.080 --> 02:49.080
I don't know if they upped him when the sculptor came to him.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.080
He was famous for no face.

02:51.080 --> 02:56.080
You know, I'm not really, my face isn't really the thing that's for sale.

02:56.080 --> 03:02.080
I have that kind of famous more for my lack of face than anything.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.080
But probably easier to sculpt.

03:04.080 --> 03:08.080
Yeah, yeah, I'm not sure the sculptor was like, slam dunk.

03:08.080 --> 03:12.080
But I just know that George Washington and Abe Lincoln's still up there.

03:12.080 --> 03:15.080
It's not like I'm racist or something.

03:15.080 --> 03:18.080
I mean, I'm still American.

03:18.080 --> 03:22.080
I think, I don't know, I still value America.

03:22.080 --> 03:25.080
I'm a capitalist for God's sakes.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.080
I don't want to socialize medicine.

03:27.080 --> 03:31.080
If you get sick, you should have to pay for your medical care.

03:31.080 --> 03:35.080
And slaves should be free.

03:35.080 --> 03:40.080
I think the only reason Teddy Roosevelt's on the monument is because he was a friend

03:40.080 --> 03:41.080
of the sculptor, right?

03:41.080 --> 03:43.080
That was kind of an inside joke.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.080
No, that's probably what Cobra's big problem with.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.080
Let's get this fucking Teddy Roosevelt off of here.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.080
He didn't earn this.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.080
I did.

03:53.080 --> 03:57.080
By having a smooth face.

03:57.080 --> 04:03.080
But yeah, the world seemed, that was the elephant in the room.

04:03.080 --> 04:08.080
GI Joe were terrorists because they were in a world where Cobra was the establishment.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.080
But pretty much the same behavior occurring.

04:11.080 --> 04:14.080
Just people shooting at each other with lasers.

04:14.080 --> 04:19.080
All right, so there's a new thing for the moon colony.

04:19.080 --> 04:22.080
All right.

04:22.080 --> 04:27.080
I love that we've returned to our premise after all these years.

04:27.080 --> 04:34.080
Okay, we don't, the jury's still out on whether or not there will be restaurants on the moon.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.080
There has to be restaurants.

04:36.080 --> 04:39.080
One for Jeff, VIP moon.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.080
VIP moon is going to have great restaurants.

04:42.080 --> 04:51.080
Actually, I was thinking about making the moon a second to a friend and my little VIP moon is just going to be a taco truck.

04:51.080 --> 04:56.080
Here is, because I cannot enact this legislation on the earth, that's the only reason I'm bringing up the moon.

04:56.080 --> 05:00.080
Because I have no control over what goes down here.

05:00.080 --> 05:05.080
But I would like to make this suggestion to the wait staff of America.

05:05.080 --> 05:10.080
I think that when you come up to the table, and it's time to clear the plates away.

05:10.080 --> 05:18.080
And when you see that a plate has been cleared by the diner, like lift clean.

05:18.080 --> 05:26.080
I know that the overwhelming temptation that you've learned this from other waiters and then learned it from your behavior at the table.

05:26.080 --> 05:31.080
I know that you want to do the hilarious looks like you didn't like it bit.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.080
Looks like you hated it.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.080
Looks like you hated it.

05:35.080 --> 05:38.080
I think we have to stop it.

05:38.080 --> 05:44.080
It's a cancerous joke.

05:44.080 --> 05:51.080
It takes in joy and it creates discomfort.

05:51.080 --> 05:59.080
You think you're misperceiving people's nervous chuckles as joy.

05:59.080 --> 06:04.080
You might as well just go up to people and go, whoa, do you hate me or something?

06:04.080 --> 06:07.080
And make them go, no.

06:07.080 --> 06:11.080
That sound, that's not happiness, that sound.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.080
That's like, oh God, Jesus Christ, this person's making me uncomfortable.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.080
It's just sort of like, what do you want?

06:17.080 --> 06:19.080
Just go away.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.080
It looks like you didn't like your food.

06:21.080 --> 06:27.080
No, I did. That's why I ate all the food.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.080
I did like it. I liked it so much.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.080
I opposite hated it.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.080
That's why you said that.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.080
Here's your money.

06:35.080 --> 06:42.080
The worst case scenario is it makes you feel fat, like the person you're talking to.

06:42.080 --> 06:50.080
The best case scenario is just kind of just nervousness, just confusion and anxiety.

06:50.080 --> 06:56.080
So stop it if you can down here, but on earth on the moon that will not be allowed.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.080
And that may be the reason why there cannot be restaurants.

06:58.080 --> 07:01.080
That and close-up magic.

07:01.080 --> 07:04.080
No fucking close-up magic.

07:04.080 --> 07:08.080
Yeah, well restaurants bring a lot of society's pains.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.080
If you eliminate restaurants, there's not going to be close-up magicians.

07:11.080 --> 07:14.080
I don't like magic. We've talked about this a number of times.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.080
Fuck magicians.

07:16.080 --> 07:19.080
But magic is lies.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.080
It's just somebody lying to you.

07:21.080 --> 07:22.080
It's not a trick.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.080
A magic trick is just a lie.

07:24.080 --> 07:29.080
And when magicians, I'm sure I'm repeating myself, but when a magician goes,

07:29.080 --> 07:33.080
if someone does a card trick, I go, wow, how'd you do that?

07:33.080 --> 07:35.080
Can't tell you, man.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.080
Can't tell you because that's part of the magician's code.

07:38.080 --> 07:42.080
The reason why they can't tell you is because if they told you, you're a magician.

07:42.080 --> 07:46.080
We'd all be magicians if you knew the fucking stupid fucking trick.

07:46.080 --> 07:51.080
And you'd have to wear a vest and stink and be named Dave.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.080
I don't know.

07:53.080 --> 07:57.080
I'm thinking of one guy.

07:57.080 --> 08:01.080
However, I went to the fucking magic castle against my will

08:01.080 --> 08:04.080
and against all fucking better judgment because the magic castle, as I said before,

08:04.080 --> 08:07.080
is a bummer and it smells like poo.

08:07.080 --> 08:12.080
But I went there and I was brought up on stage by the, it wasn't the close-up stage,

08:12.080 --> 08:14.080
it was like the medium-sized stage.

08:14.080 --> 08:17.080
And the guy saw me in my suit and goes, you.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.080
Did I talk about this on the show already?

08:18.080 --> 08:19.080
Yeah.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.080
I did?

08:20.080 --> 08:22.080
All right, go fuck yourself.

08:22.080 --> 08:25.080
Yeah, he brought me up on stage because he thought I would be skeptical.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.080
And he proceeded to blow my mind.

08:27.080 --> 08:31.080
He needed me up on stage to prove to the audience that like fucking, like it was really magical.

08:31.080 --> 08:33.080
You mean you had to like cut a rope or?

08:33.080 --> 08:35.080
No, he dropped coins.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.080
He kept dropping metal coins into my hand and then when he would close my hand,

08:38.080 --> 08:41.080
and I would see like one, two, three, four coins go into my hand,

08:41.080 --> 08:44.080
big loud metal coins would close my fists.

08:44.080 --> 08:47.080
And he would say, how many coins are in your hands?

08:47.080 --> 08:49.080
In front of 45 people.

08:49.080 --> 08:54.080
And I would say, well, four. And he opened my hand and there would be a rubber ball in my hand.

08:54.080 --> 08:57.080
And it was fucking magic.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.080
So I take everything back.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.080
So you like, all right, all right.

09:01.080 --> 09:04.080
It has to be real magic otherwise.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.080
It has to be real.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.080
It's still fucking.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.080
And also he smelled like mildew.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.080
It smells like a grandpa sleeping bag there.

09:13.080 --> 09:16.080
The one that died in his sleeping bag.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.080
How about the magic trick of make the smell disappear?

09:19.080 --> 09:21.080
Yeah, that would be quite a trick.

09:21.080 --> 09:23.080
Fuck the ghost at the piano.

09:23.080 --> 09:26.080
Take a magic bath, people.

09:26.080 --> 09:31.080
I stopped myself halfway through that because I'm, what have I become?

09:31.080 --> 09:34.080
Yeah, you're the guy that hates being told to take a bath.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.080
A magic castle should be my people.

09:36.080 --> 09:40.080
If I knew how to lie better, I should just be there instead of the moon.

09:40.080 --> 09:45.080
I should be just saying abracadabra and hanging out in my dumb hat.

09:45.080 --> 09:53.080
You ever get scared bagging on magicians that, you know, you'll come home

09:53.080 --> 09:56.080
and your bed will be just about half.

09:56.080 --> 10:00.080
I live in mortal fear of that.

10:00.080 --> 10:05.080
Does anybody really like magic?

10:05.080 --> 10:10.080
I mean, you just said yourself, I mean, you described an experience that was well done.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.080
But I wasn't, I didn't have fun.

10:12.080 --> 10:15.080
I was like, oh, you're faking me out.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.080
You're doing like, like it's just lies.

10:17.080 --> 10:21.080
I get very nervous in regular conversations, let alone conversations where I'm being asked questions,

10:21.080 --> 10:25.080
told what to do, afraid I'm going to do it wrong.

10:25.080 --> 10:32.080
Like my, my, the few times that I've been engaged by a magician have caused me such, such anxiety

10:32.080 --> 10:38.080
that I think I exude like a force field that magicians don't pick me and stuff.

10:38.080 --> 10:44.080
Because I just get so nervous in those things when people go like, oh, put this in your hand.

10:44.080 --> 10:49.080
Oh, the other left hand.

10:49.080 --> 10:53.080
I'm surprised that somebody actually, a recent waiter, a waitress, gave you the,

10:53.080 --> 10:56.080
looks like you didn't like it bit.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.080
That was, that was this weekend that happened.

10:58.080 --> 11:01.080
The guy at Umami Burger, a hipster burger place in Hollywood.

11:01.080 --> 11:09.080
But still his, his mustache was waxed, he was wearing a, you know, half a strap of an overall,

11:09.080 --> 11:14.080
whatever the fuck the kids are doing these days, a henna tattoo of Pokemon on his face.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.080
I don't know, whatever.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.080
He was a hologram.

11:18.080 --> 11:25.080
He, he, he, but still saw, saw the crumbs and just like the 45 year old midwestern diner waitress in him

11:25.080 --> 11:27.080
just jumped out.

11:27.080 --> 11:32.080
Yeah.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.080
No, I did.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.080
I swear.

11:35.080 --> 11:39.080
Why are we fighting?

11:39.080 --> 11:44.080
What is the instinct to be sarcastic in a moment that should just be celebrated?

11:44.080 --> 11:45.080
Oh, wow.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.080
You loved the mac and cheese.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.080
It's gone.

11:47.080 --> 11:50.080
It's in your, it's in your boo boo's.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.080
Good boy.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.080
Clean plate club.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.080
Just, just be nice in that moment.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.080
You don't have to be Willy Wonka.

11:58.080 --> 12:01.080
You don't have to fucking stretch my boundaries.

12:01.080 --> 12:04.080
Teach me that truth is relative.

12:04.080 --> 12:10.080
You're not a fucking like, you're not, you're not, you're not a, you're not Mad Bartigan.

12:10.080 --> 12:13.080
I don't know what I was going to say.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.080
Are you comparing him to Willow?

12:15.080 --> 12:17.080
I don't know why that name leapt into my head.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.080
Oh, because I miss Erin.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.080
That's why she's in Chicago.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.080
Yeah.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.080
Thanks guys.

12:22.080 --> 12:25.080
That was, that was heartfelt.

12:25.080 --> 12:28.080
She's in Chicago doing like these shows and stuff.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.080
And it's like two days without her.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.080
I'm just a wreck.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.080
Why is that?

12:32.080 --> 12:37.080
I just, I guess either, the healthiest answer because I love her.

12:37.080 --> 12:41.080
If I'm unhealthy, I'm an emotional vampire and I was feeding off of her.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.080
I don't know.

12:42.080 --> 12:46.080
In either case, she was, she was integral to my, to my happiness.

12:46.080 --> 12:49.080
You guys, are you guys going to get married?

12:49.080 --> 12:53.080
Well, you know, I don't know if you understand how marriage works, but typically you're not

12:53.080 --> 12:56.080
supposed to give that much of a heads up.

12:56.080 --> 13:02.080
Like, if I said yes, then, and then when I, when I, when I proposed to her, she's going

13:02.080 --> 13:06.080
to say finally instead of yes.

13:06.080 --> 13:10.080
You're being extra weird about it for no reason.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.080
You guys haven't discussed this?

13:12.080 --> 13:14.080
It's not, it's not a discussion that you guys have had?

13:14.080 --> 13:17.080
I think there's a lot, well, I think she knows that I want to be with her forever and stuff,

13:17.080 --> 13:22.080
but you know, you, you know that there's a, there's a, there's a, it's, it's, it's

13:22.080 --> 13:27.080
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, there's a tackiness to, you know, pointing

13:27.080 --> 13:28.080
at the bleachers.

13:28.080 --> 13:32.080
Why don't you, why don't you be the first person to propose to her on a podcast that

13:32.080 --> 13:36.080
will come out two days from now?

13:36.080 --> 13:37.080
Because that.

13:37.080 --> 13:42.080
And you can like, like, like put a ring on her iPhone and like, I don't know.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.080
Because that, that will be her moment.

13:44.080 --> 13:49.080
I don't want to, I don't want to be one of those guys that embarrasses the, the, the,

13:49.080 --> 13:54.080
the, the, the, the, the proposal, you know, I want to, I want to do it regular style

13:54.080 --> 13:56.080
and see, you're going to do it.

13:56.080 --> 14:07.080
Well, I, I, I, I have no plans to, to, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,

14:07.080 --> 14:12.080
I'm not breaking up with her and, and I'm not dying.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.080
Ergo, marriage is imminent.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.080
Ergo, will you marry me?

14:17.080 --> 14:21.080
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's just, isn't there some magic to this idea?

14:21.080 --> 14:22.080
Hey, hey, sorry you brought it up.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.080
I'm sorry you brought it up.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.080
You don't have to marry her.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.080
No, no one's making you marry her.

14:28.080 --> 14:31.080
If I, if I asked you if you were going to marry your girlfriend, you know that the,

14:31.080 --> 14:34.080
you know what that would, the spot that you would be put on.

14:34.080 --> 14:38.080
You'd have to, that's a yes or no question to something that you're not supposed to

14:38.080 --> 14:39.080
talk about that stuff.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.080
Why not?

14:40.080 --> 14:41.080
All right.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.080
Jeff, are you going to marry the girlfriend that you're with right now?

14:43.080 --> 14:44.080
No.

14:44.080 --> 14:56.080
Are you?

14:56.080 --> 15:08.080
Yes.

15:08.080 --> 15:13.080
Although this, I made that decision before I found out yours was going to be available.

15:13.080 --> 15:20.080
She's a delight.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.080
All right.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.080
Yes.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.080
Yes.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.080
I miss Erin.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.080
Yes.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.080
One day.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.080
Yes.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.080
I'll make an honest woman out of her.

15:29.080 --> 15:32.080
She's a, where's that, where's that expression come from?

15:32.080 --> 15:37.080
Well, I guess I, I guess I, I guess I just like the idea that you're making a woman dishonest

15:37.080 --> 15:44.080
like just like, I guess that hails back to a time when, when sex was a criminal act,

15:44.080 --> 15:45.080
like out of wedlock.

15:45.080 --> 15:49.080
Like you had to, if you were having sex with somebody and they weren't married to them,

15:49.080 --> 15:53.080
they had to lie to the gas station attendant.

15:53.080 --> 15:59.080
Where would you, I'm sure Erin's, I know Erin enough to know she's the kind of person that

15:59.080 --> 16:01.080
probably has ideas about what her ideal wedding would be.

16:01.080 --> 16:04.080
But if you, like, like, where would you like to be married?

16:04.080 --> 16:07.080
Like in like the best of all possible worlds?

16:07.080 --> 16:12.080
I, I, I, I would start that conversation by acknowledging that I think the ceremonies

16:12.080 --> 16:16.080
are more for the, for the people, you know, like, because you could take somebody and

16:16.080 --> 16:19.080
stand under a waterfall and, or go to city hall.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.080
I think Kumail and Emily went to city hall, didn't they?

16:21.080 --> 16:24.080
But maybe they had a ceremony later for friends.

16:24.080 --> 16:30.080
But, but, but like the couple, you know, there's a, marrying somebody would make a,

16:30.080 --> 16:35.080
a warehouse full of dead rats, a romantic for those two people.

16:35.080 --> 16:39.080
But for the people that you're inviting, you want to make sure that they're having a good time.

16:39.080 --> 16:45.080
And to that effect, I would like to do a Raiders and the Lost Ark themed wedding where,

16:45.080 --> 16:54.080
where the audience was, was not only allowed to, but really required to help save our marriage from

16:54.080 --> 16:57.080
uh, Destro, I don't know.

16:57.080 --> 17:01.080
Are you two going to be tied to a stake in the, and when they, when the ring comes out,

17:01.080 --> 17:03.080
you're going to say, don't look at it.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.080
Yeah, yeah.

17:04.080 --> 17:05.080
Yeah.

17:05.080 --> 17:08.080
The, the, the officiant will be a melting Nazi.

17:08.080 --> 17:14.080
Well, also a, a, a ceremonial garb and he'll, he'll, he'll open up.

17:14.080 --> 17:16.080
We'll get married by bella.

17:16.080 --> 17:20.080
Well, all of the attendees have to dress like Nazis too.

17:20.080 --> 17:25.080
I think that was a Nazi heavy ceremony in Raiders and the Lost Ark.

17:25.080 --> 17:26.080
What are you doing?

17:26.080 --> 17:29.080
Aaron's texting me.

17:29.080 --> 17:33.080
It's like she knows the show is going on.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.080
Why did she, why did she text me?

17:35.080 --> 17:36.080
Read it!

17:36.080 --> 17:38.080
No, because it...

17:38.080 --> 17:42.080
She said yes?

17:42.080 --> 17:46.080
That, that means Adam Goldberg is texting her.

17:46.080 --> 17:49.080
And she's saying I do right now.

17:49.080 --> 17:54.080
No, no, she doesn't, she, she's just, uh, wait, she's, I don't know, she's at, I think she's at,

17:54.080 --> 17:58.080
she's at some hip hop show and then she says, she sent me all texts, all caps.

17:58.080 --> 18:01.080
Ah, an MC just dropped your name.

18:01.080 --> 18:05.080
Ah, ah.

18:05.080 --> 18:08.080
And then, and then a follow up text in reference to community.

18:08.080 --> 18:13.080
Ah, like it would be in reference to my world famous carrot cake recipe.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.080
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, before we get started.

18:15.080 --> 18:18.080
I want to give a big shout out to Dan Harmon.

18:18.080 --> 18:22.080
He puts the right amount of cinnamon in that carrot cake.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.080
He's out there keeping it real.

18:24.080 --> 18:27.080
Not too much carrot.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.080
I assume is the secret.

18:29.080 --> 18:34.080
It's a cake, not a salad.

18:34.080 --> 18:38.080
Did you know that, uh, Harmontown is a Feral Audio podcast, Jeff?

18:38.080 --> 18:40.080
I wasn't familiar with that concept.

18:40.080 --> 18:43.080
And then you can go to feralaudio.com and, and here,

18:43.080 --> 18:46.080
some of the most amazing people in the world, like,

18:46.080 --> 18:51.080
like for instance, Duncan Tressel or Erin McGathy or Chelsea Peretti.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.080
It's called Feral Audio.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.080
Was it raised in the wilderness?

18:54.080 --> 18:58.080
Was it, was it real audio but it didn't have parents and was raised in the streets?

18:58.080 --> 18:59.080
Yeah.

18:59.080 --> 19:02.080
I think it's like, like, like you look at Dustin, you know,

19:02.080 --> 19:05.080
Dustin sort of is Feral Audio and he's, he's like a live,

19:05.080 --> 19:10.080
kind of stringy, uh, street cat.

19:10.080 --> 19:13.080
I always assumed it was sort of his totem that he was like a,

19:13.080 --> 19:15.080
he's like an alley cat.

19:15.080 --> 19:19.080
He's a little, he's a little, little, little scrapper.

19:19.080 --> 19:29.080
He's, he's, he's, he's, and if he scratches you, you get sick.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.080
Is that true?

19:31.080 --> 19:33.080
Dustin? Oh yeah.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.080
You ever get scratched by him?

19:35.080 --> 19:37.080
Yeah, just last night. I don't feel so well.

19:37.080 --> 19:38.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.080
It's bad news.

19:40.080 --> 19:43.080
Uh, yeah, no, but that's, that's, that's the plug for this week is just go,

19:43.080 --> 19:44.080
it's a network.

19:44.080 --> 19:48.080
Go to feralaudio.com and, and I'm, I'm, I'm not kidding.

19:48.080 --> 19:51.080
I mean, if we were, if we were, if I wouldn't see this about Pringles,

19:51.080 --> 19:53.080
even if they were giving us money, which is why they won't.

19:53.080 --> 19:57.080
Uh, I mean, cause I would be like, well, I, I would say Pringles are delicious,

19:57.080 --> 19:58.080
but they're probably bad for you.

19:58.080 --> 20:01.080
I wrote, I wrote them the best jingle of all time and nothing.

20:01.080 --> 20:03.080
Yeah.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.080
Yeah, yeah.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.080
Nike.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.080
What'd you say?

20:06.080 --> 20:07.080
Nike.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.080
Nike.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.080
Yeah.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.080
Somebody just brought me some Adam Goldberg.

20:11.080 --> 20:13.080
Brought me a weird,

20:13.080 --> 20:18.080
lazy stacks canister speaking of food at the show.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.080
Thank you.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.080
Where's Bill?

20:20.080 --> 20:21.080
I don't see Bill.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.080
Bill's not here.

20:22.080 --> 20:23.080
Beef fungus.

20:23.080 --> 20:28.080
Bill got a taste of his own beef fungus and Adam,

20:28.080 --> 20:33.080
why did you give me alternative Pringles seemed right in the moment?

20:33.080 --> 20:35.080
Seemed right in the moment.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.080
He's a dot connector.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.080
Adam connects dots.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.080
He said Pringles.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.080
He had a cylinder in his hands.

20:39.080 --> 20:46.080
See, wait, they're half eaten kind of bullshit.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.080
Should we just get a Goldberg update?

20:48.080 --> 20:58.080
Just bring Adam up here with Goldberg update.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.080
Nope.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.080
No, no, no.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.080
Like a lazy stack.

21:01.080 --> 21:02.080
Are they baked?

21:02.080 --> 21:03.080
Or what is the,

21:03.080 --> 21:06.080
Probably I am hot drugs.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.080
Okay.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.080
So that's great about Aaron.

21:09.080 --> 21:12.080
It's really cool that an emcee dropped your name.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.080
Ah.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.080
Ah, that's.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.080
No back brace?

21:16.080 --> 21:18.080
No, I'm doing pretty well on that actually.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.080
What's going on with your back?

21:20.080 --> 21:26.080
I'm only going to answer questions while eating delicious lazy stacks

21:26.080 --> 21:30.080
available in cheddar from the Dollar Store of Pasadena.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.080
These better be good for you.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.080
These suck.

21:32.080 --> 21:38.080
Well, I can go point down.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.080
My back brace is I can,

21:40.080 --> 21:43.080
most important thing is more about my back brace.

21:43.080 --> 21:46.080
Yeah, these are delicious.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.080
Are you on something?

21:47.080 --> 21:48.080
No.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.080
You said drugs.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.080
Yeah, I did.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.080
Didn't I?

21:51.080 --> 21:53.080
No, it's just a delicious flavor of Lay's cheddar.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.080
You're right.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.080
These just don't.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.080
You're high as fuck right now.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.080
Adam.

21:59.080 --> 22:04.080
Your family listens to this podcast.

22:04.080 --> 22:08.080
My brother asked if there are any extra XL t-shirts.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.080
You don't have to say yes,

22:09.080 --> 22:12.080
but this does count as me asking on the record.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.080
Fuck that guy.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.080
Yeah, fair enough.

22:15.080 --> 22:18.080
And my back has been slowly recovering due to physical therapy,

22:18.080 --> 22:20.080
but now that I'm back to lifting.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.080
Thank you.

22:21.080 --> 22:23.080
One person applauded and they're the best person.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.080
It's your physical therapist.

22:26.080 --> 22:30.080
It's work. Yeah.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.080
No, I'm doing pretty much better.

22:32.080 --> 22:35.080
I was lifting a bunch of boxes for a Christian film this weekend.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.080
Yeah.

22:36.080 --> 22:40.080
And I met, actually I met a fan of the podcast on the film

22:40.080 --> 22:42.080
and he's much more interesting than I am.

22:42.080 --> 22:45.080
And I'd like to invite Jay to the stage because I'm doing terrible.

22:45.080 --> 22:49.080
It's not, it is not, it is not your fucking privilege

22:49.080 --> 22:52.080
to invite people to the stage.

22:52.080 --> 22:55.080
It is not how that works.

22:55.080 --> 22:57.080
It is.

22:57.080 --> 23:00.080
What if I sweeten the deal of some delicious Lay's Stacks

23:00.080 --> 23:04.080
available in show from the Pasadena 99th century?

23:04.080 --> 23:06.080
This time you've gone too far.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.080
Okay.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.080
Why don't we just,

23:08.080 --> 23:10.080
Dan, why don't we just sit out in the audience

23:10.080 --> 23:12.080
and let Adam do the rest of the show?

23:12.080 --> 23:15.080
That would be a bad idea and let's do it.

23:15.080 --> 23:18.080
Give us the headline on what makes him so interesting.

23:18.080 --> 23:21.080
Well, Lay's Stacks are the ultimate way to recharge.

23:21.080 --> 23:24.080
And it says Lay's Stacks and there's not enough room.

23:24.080 --> 23:27.080
There's a copyright symbol and it says brand underneath it.

23:27.080 --> 23:31.080
So please do not use Lay's Stacks, all capitals,

23:31.080 --> 23:35.080
in a way that the Frito Lay Corporation would dislike

23:35.080 --> 23:38.080
because they are a registered brand.

23:38.080 --> 23:41.080
Cheddar flavored potato crisps give you the whole flavor.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.080
What are you, what is going on?

23:43.080 --> 23:45.080
Are you Crispin Glover now?

23:45.080 --> 23:47.080
Are you going to start crowding kicking?

23:47.080 --> 23:49.080
You're reading a potato chip label.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.080
I really want to punt these into the audience

23:51.080 --> 23:55.080
but like the first three runs will suffer more than they are now.

23:55.080 --> 23:57.080
You've gone mad with, you've gone mad with it.

23:57.080 --> 24:01.080
I've gone mad with delicious cheddar flavored flavor.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.080
And 9% of my daily sodium.

24:03.080 --> 24:04.080
I'm done.

24:04.080 --> 24:05.080
I'm just, that's about it.

24:05.080 --> 24:07.080
Adam Goldberg everybody.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.080
Hey.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.080
What just happened?

24:17.080 --> 24:19.080
I don't believe, I'm thinking maybe he's on painkillers or something.

24:19.080 --> 24:21.080
That's why his back braces are on?

24:21.080 --> 24:23.080
That's PCP. He's on PCP.

24:23.080 --> 24:25.080
Is that dust? Is that angel dust?

24:25.080 --> 24:26.080
Angel dust.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.080
Is that what angel dust is?

24:28.080 --> 24:29.080
Yeah.

24:29.080 --> 24:30.080
PCP? What is PCP?

24:30.080 --> 24:31.080
It's angel dust.

24:33.080 --> 24:36.080
Well this is, I mean this is conversations going in circles.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.080
Is it like a, it's like a...

24:38.080 --> 24:41.080
PCP is the only time, I've seen people on PCP

24:41.080 --> 24:45.080
and it is a intense like,

24:45.080 --> 24:47.080
I'm not sure the original purpose,

24:47.080 --> 24:49.080
I think it was like a horse tranquilizer or some crazy shit.

24:49.080 --> 24:52.080
And friends of mine accidentally have done it

24:52.080 --> 24:55.080
and I've seen them and they thought they could do anything

24:55.080 --> 24:57.080
and they really just go berserk.

24:57.080 --> 25:01.080
And like, you really do think you could punch your fist through a wall

25:01.080 --> 25:02.080
so you try it.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.080
And then there was that bath salts thing

25:04.080 --> 25:07.080
that made you think that you would like to eat a face.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.080
What?

25:08.080 --> 25:09.080
Yeah.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.080
You don't even know.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.080
Bath salts.

25:11.080 --> 25:15.080
For a little while there, there was a spate of human,

25:15.080 --> 25:20.080
unhuman murder cannibalism happening on this drug.

25:20.080 --> 25:26.080
I thought it was actually people snorting the product called bath salts,

25:26.080 --> 25:29.080
like the actual bath salts that someone had figured out

25:29.080 --> 25:32.080
that you could snort that and get high

25:32.080 --> 25:34.080
but it was also making you eat faces.

25:34.080 --> 25:37.080
But I think it's, isn't it just a drug you kids are taking?

25:37.080 --> 25:40.080
What is the active ingredient in the bath salts?

25:40.080 --> 25:47.080
It's basically, it's chemically equal to something like a illegal substance

25:47.080 --> 25:50.080
but they basically use different ingredients and methods to get around it

25:50.080 --> 25:53.080
so they were selling basically what a good one to like,

25:53.080 --> 25:57.080
something like a PCB in legal form and packets and stores.

25:57.080 --> 25:59.080
It's basically meth.

25:59.080 --> 26:00.080
Yeah, it's meth.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.080
It's meth.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.080
And you take a bath in it?

26:03.080 --> 26:05.080
You smell good.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.080
Oh, okay.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.080
But there's a special ingredient, human face.

26:09.080 --> 26:13.080
Once you get a taste for it, you...

26:13.080 --> 26:17.080
Is somebody else talking out there?

26:17.080 --> 26:21.080
Did somebody just take a phone call or was somebody like loaded with information about bath salts?

26:21.080 --> 26:24.080
Because if you are, you could tell us.

26:24.080 --> 26:27.080
All right, well enough about, we talked about drugs.

26:27.080 --> 26:30.080
We talked about Cobra Commander.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.080
We talked about rock and roll.

26:32.080 --> 26:34.080
Why don't we bring Spencer up?

26:34.080 --> 26:44.080
Fuck yeah, why not?

26:44.080 --> 26:46.080
Hello, Spencer.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.080
Hey, hey, hey.

26:48.080 --> 26:53.080
Spencer, is it just me or is your beard becoming more and more majestic as time goes by?

26:53.080 --> 27:03.080
Long time fans may know that my beard increases in length every time I get more Twitter followers.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.080
But having a beard's weird.

27:05.080 --> 27:07.080
Do you like having a beard, Dan?

27:07.080 --> 27:10.080
Only if I'm able to keep it clean.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.080
Yeah, otherwise it gets very itchy.

27:12.080 --> 27:23.080
I find that people take, I mean, having a beard is a lot like having like a comment section on your face.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.080
People just feel free to say anything.

27:25.080 --> 27:27.080
They're like, oh man, how long have you been growing that?

27:27.080 --> 27:28.080
I mean, that's fine.

27:28.080 --> 27:34.080
They're like, oh, when are you planning on cutting that or this old guy's like, oh, give you $50 to cut that right now?

27:34.080 --> 27:36.080
Or someone's like, fuck you.

27:36.080 --> 27:39.080
Yeah, yeah.

27:39.080 --> 27:43.080
Yeah, it's kind of unwarranted because it's not like you did anything special.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.080
You really just let it grow.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.080
I did less than everybody else.

27:47.080 --> 27:51.080
My question is, but there's no answer to this except biology.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.080
Like, how do you get it to be so long?

27:53.080 --> 27:55.080
I don't think I'm capable of doing that.

27:55.080 --> 28:01.080
Yeah, well, what was that moving was in the movie knocked up where they make in front of a guy for growing a beard?

28:01.080 --> 28:02.080
Can't remember.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.080
Yeah, it's like that.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.080
Like there's this there's this phase.

28:05.080 --> 28:06.080
It's terrible.

28:06.080 --> 28:10.080
It's like, I think it's just long enough so it curls back and is stabbing into your face.

28:10.080 --> 28:11.080
And that's what makes it all itchy.

28:11.080 --> 28:17.080
But once you get past that, it kind of just bursts forth in majesty.

28:17.080 --> 28:22.080
Do you really think that if I just never trimmed my beard that it would ever have get acquired length like that?

28:22.080 --> 28:32.080
Yeah, when I was in like middle school and high school and stuff, people would tell me that I missed some spots shaving when I just didn't shave because it only came in like two spots on my face.

28:32.080 --> 28:37.080
But eventually you just if you don't shave it, it'll start filling out and stuff.

28:37.080 --> 28:40.080
I think it's just that everything grows at a different rate.

28:40.080 --> 28:42.080
So if you're shaving your whole face, it'll only be patchy.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.080
But if you let it grow long enough, you know.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.080
Dan, do you not trim your beard?

28:46.080 --> 28:47.080
You don't curtail that?

28:47.080 --> 28:49.080
It stops at that length?

28:49.080 --> 29:01.080
I usually end up trimming it, but I feel like if I didn't, when I don't trim it, all that happens is it just sort of like, as I've said, it just kind of Galifianacus is like, it just kind of gets bushier.

29:01.080 --> 29:07.080
But it doesn't really take on this cascading, beautiful waterfall of manhood.

29:07.080 --> 29:12.080
I don't know. I think the bushy look is a lot better. This just looks really weird.

29:12.080 --> 29:26.080
Well, I'm just saying, I don't know if everyone automatically has the ability to like, zeezy top it. I think some of us would just, I would just look more and more like, there was a donut of hair around my head.

29:26.080 --> 29:32.080
I would just end up being like this weird Dick Tracy character. Donut head.

29:32.080 --> 29:36.080
I'm taking Dick Tracy out of the headlines. I'm rubbing him out.

29:36.080 --> 29:40.080
Easy donut head. Just keep playing poker.

29:40.080 --> 29:47.080
Hey, little face. Yeah, donut head. What's the difference between us?

29:47.080 --> 29:57.080
I have a tiny face surrounded by a head. Do you have a regular head surrounded by a bunch of hair? Why am I explaining this to you?

29:57.080 --> 30:01.080
Because I'm donut head. I'm not too bright.

30:01.080 --> 30:10.080
You got involved in organized crime? Not because it was my passion. It was because I had no other options. I lacked the aptitude for other occupations.

30:10.080 --> 30:17.080
Ah, come on donut head. Don't be so hard on yourself. You get the tiny little face. You're born to be a gangster.

30:17.080 --> 30:23.080
You being sarcastic? No. I pick up on that shit, you see.

30:23.080 --> 30:34.080
Well, let's get Dick Tracy. Alright, little face. Later.

30:34.080 --> 30:39.080
Why do you keep your bread in the freezer? What are you doing in my apartment?

30:39.080 --> 30:44.080
Who keeps bread in the freezer? You want a sandwich? Now you go to the freezer and the bread's fucking frozen.

30:44.080 --> 30:47.080
What are you gonna... You know you need a sandwich? A half hour before?

30:47.080 --> 30:54.080
What, meanwhile? I want my face to be more to the left.

30:54.080 --> 30:59.080
Oh, but to call the commander, they want to replace him as the Roosevelt.

30:59.080 --> 31:06.080
I don't care. I heard he didn't even do anything to be on this mountain. Also, G.I. Joe's terrible. I hate them.

31:06.080 --> 31:10.080
Later.

31:10.080 --> 31:23.080
Stacy, move those shoes. You found the bottom of my improv hopper.

31:23.080 --> 31:33.080
I wanted that to go on for the rest of my life. I wanted to just keep saying, meanwhile and later, that would go on forever.

31:33.080 --> 31:45.080
I had to go, I got bad pretty quick, didn't it? Didn't even start that good. Just looking at my Evernote, back to Evernote.

31:45.080 --> 31:51.080
Alright, I let the waiters have it, right? Just don't do that.

31:51.080 --> 31:56.080
What do you mean, why not? Who said that? Are you a waitress?

31:56.080 --> 32:04.080
Come up on stage and get a microphone.

32:04.080 --> 32:09.080
Alright, can we re-pipe some of that now that maybe we'll edit out the... So you are a wait person.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.080
I was.

32:10.080 --> 32:15.080
Who has taken the stage. You were a wait person for seven years, did you say?

32:15.080 --> 32:22.080
I had six years from numerous restaurants around the LA County that have no need for me, so there you go.

32:22.080 --> 32:28.080
Okay, and what you were saying is that you learned from wait people.

32:28.080 --> 32:37.080
Yeah, well, it's like, okay, you finish your pie, I'm like, oh, you look like you really like it there, right? That's what they say, you know.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.080
Well, no, they say it looks like you hated it.

32:39.080 --> 32:43.080
Right, whatever. Well, what you said, you know what I mean, I'm sorry.

32:43.080 --> 32:48.080
Well, I mean, but what you said, I want to point out is actually kind of a, I mean, that wouldn't be half as bad.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.080
Yeah, I would say, you really liked it.

32:50.080 --> 32:52.080
Well, yeah, thank you.

32:52.080 --> 32:59.080
But I'm saying I've worked with people that have said that, and I, as a waitress, when I've gone out to eat, they've told me that, oh, it looks like you hated it.

32:59.080 --> 33:01.080
And you don't like that, do you?

33:01.080 --> 33:08.080
And I didn't like it, but I've had friends that have been with me while it's been said to me that, and here's what you do.

33:08.080 --> 33:11.080
The next time they tell you that, you say, yeah, it sucked.

33:11.080 --> 33:15.080
You say that, you say that, and then they're kind of confused.

33:15.080 --> 33:20.080
But if you, like, for example, if you, why'd you eat it, if it sucked, why'd you eat it all?

33:20.080 --> 33:27.080
And you're like, you could say, well, because I couldn't order anything else, because you were too lazy to come back from me to change my order.

33:27.080 --> 33:31.080
And I swear to God, that will make them feel worse, because the biggest servers don't.

33:31.080 --> 33:38.080
So in telling them you murdered their parents, I mean, it comes to a certain point where it's just like, what is our goal here as a society?

33:38.080 --> 33:42.080
Is it just to poison each other's brains and souls?

33:42.080 --> 33:49.080
Yes. No, I'm just saying, if you want to make them feel bad, because they've been, they've told me that before.

33:49.080 --> 33:53.080
Well, okay, here's the thing, I used to work at Johnny Rockets and Johnny Rockets has Apple Pie.

33:53.080 --> 33:58.080
They have Apple Pie with cheddar cheese on it. I don't recommend it. You should go to Pans is better.

33:58.080 --> 34:04.080
Anyway, you, you ordered that and some people would be like, well, yeah, the pie was too burnt.

34:04.080 --> 34:07.080
And I'm like, well, why'd you, why'd you finish it? And they're like, well, because I was hungry.

34:07.080 --> 34:13.080
And then they still, what's even tacky is when they asked for a refund on something that they ate in completion.

34:13.080 --> 34:19.080
But you know, if you want to make them feel bad, ask for a refund. You don't necessarily have to get it, but you'll definitely put the server in their place.

34:19.080 --> 34:20.080
All right, well, I'm just saying.

34:20.080 --> 34:24.080
Lisette, did you work at one of the Johnny Rockets where you had to like get up on the counter and sing and dance?

34:24.080 --> 34:25.080
That's Ed DeBellas.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.080
Yes, it was.

34:26.080 --> 34:30.080
There are Johnny Rockets. If they play YMCA, you have to get up and do it.

34:30.080 --> 34:32.080
Or Respect by, yeah, by Rita Franklin.

34:32.080 --> 34:33.080
Did you have to do that?

34:33.080 --> 34:36.080
Oh, it was very, it wasn't my better day.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.080
Can we see a little version of it?

34:37.080 --> 34:39.080
No, thank you. No, no.

34:39.080 --> 34:42.080
She just said it was horrible.

34:42.080 --> 34:46.080
She's comfortable telling, making people feel worse about things.

34:46.080 --> 34:50.080
No, I'm just saying, I've been a server and I've, you know...

34:50.080 --> 34:52.080
What you want?

34:54.080 --> 34:58.080
Is that like the sound of an alarm clock in a movie or are you going like...

34:58.080 --> 35:02.080
I still like that song regardless that I had to dance to it, but I'm just saying, yeah.

35:02.080 --> 35:06.080
It's not that I'm trying to make a server feel bad. I'm just saying, there's two kinds of servers.

35:06.080 --> 35:09.080
They're dicks and then they're nice people. They're nice people.

35:09.080 --> 35:11.080
Yeah, basically.

35:11.080 --> 35:14.080
Dicks and knife people. I was like, holy shit, this is going to...

35:14.080 --> 35:15.080
I said nice.

35:15.080 --> 35:19.080
I know, I know. Originally when you said that though, I thought, wow.

35:19.080 --> 35:25.080
Look, as everyone has gone out to eat in the city, I'm pretty sure we all come across the narcissistic waiter

35:25.080 --> 35:28.080
and then there's, you know, the overtly nice people.

35:28.080 --> 35:34.080
I was one of the waitresses that was super nice. That's why I never got fired right away, but...

35:34.080 --> 35:37.080
You got fired for embezzling later on down the road?

35:37.080 --> 35:41.080
No, I once got fired for telling someone that they were inadvertently fat.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.080
I didn't mean to.

35:42.080 --> 35:44.080
Wait, you said they were inadvertently fat?

35:44.080 --> 35:46.080
No, I didn't say that. Well, it's like, okay.

35:46.080 --> 35:51.080
So this lady comes in and she orders a chicken pot pie, right?

35:51.080 --> 35:54.080
But prior to ordering it, her friends are like, oh, she just got wisdom teeth.

35:54.080 --> 35:57.080
What do you think about the chicken pot pie?

35:57.080 --> 36:00.080
I said, it's too heavy for you. I said that.

36:00.080 --> 36:06.080
I was referencing texture, but I wasn't smart enough to say, oh, the texture for that is too heavy for your teeth.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.080
I just said, oh, yeah, that's too heavy.

36:08.080 --> 36:12.080
So she equates that with, oh, you're calling me fat? She told my manager, I got fired.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.080
Wow.

36:13.080 --> 36:14.080
There you go.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.080
Holy crap.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.080
That would be...

36:16.080 --> 36:17.080
Was she fat?

36:17.080 --> 36:20.080
No, she was okay. You know, she wasn't...

36:20.080 --> 36:21.080
She was fat.

36:21.080 --> 36:26.080
No, she was a little stocky, but I'm not going to say that.

36:26.080 --> 36:31.080
She was a little stocky, but I'm not going to say that.

36:31.080 --> 36:35.080
But I'm curious though, because you said it's too heavy for you.

36:35.080 --> 36:40.080
It's the for you that made her go, oh, what did you mean by for you?

36:40.080 --> 36:43.080
Well, I should have said, no, the texture of chicken pot pie, we've all had it.

36:43.080 --> 36:47.080
It's basically mashed potatoes in a pie. Come on, and peas and chicken.

36:47.080 --> 36:51.080
But you were saying for her, why?

36:51.080 --> 36:53.080
Because she just got wisdom teeth surgery.

36:53.080 --> 36:57.080
Oh, why did you know that? She said that?

36:57.080 --> 36:59.080
Did I not say that earlier?

36:59.080 --> 37:04.080
Oh, okay, sorry. Hey, I'm a terrible interviewer. I was probably thinking about...

37:04.080 --> 37:08.080
You're probably only a terrible interviewer because you keep telling yourself that you're a terrible interviewer.

37:08.080 --> 37:10.080
During the interviews, yeah, instead of listening.

37:10.080 --> 37:14.080
Do you ever not interview yourself in the bathtub? You can get better that way.

37:14.080 --> 37:19.080
No. You're talking about jerking off, right?

37:19.080 --> 37:23.080
You interview yourself in your bathtub?

37:23.080 --> 37:25.080
I interview myself all the time in the bathtub.

37:25.080 --> 37:32.080
You never fantasize about being on David Letterman or that kind of thing or Barbara Walters and having them tell you specific questions?

37:32.080 --> 37:37.080
I think maybe when I was a lot younger, yeah, I would have fantasies about being on a panel.

37:37.080 --> 37:42.080
Let's say that you were on Letterman tonight or Conan. Do you have a Conan or Letterman story?

37:42.080 --> 37:46.080
What would be your go-to anecdote that you would say?

37:46.080 --> 37:50.080
I don't know. It depends on... Why don't I have plenty of things?

37:50.080 --> 37:54.080
You're the one that practices all this shit. You don't have a go-to?

37:54.080 --> 37:58.080
Do you have a fantasy reason why you would be that noteworthy?

37:58.080 --> 38:02.080
Yeah, I don't want to work at Starbucks for the rest of my life.

38:02.080 --> 38:08.080
In your fantasy, when you're on Letterman, why is Letterman having you on in the fantasies?

38:08.080 --> 38:11.080
Is it because of a bookie road or is it because of a dance you do?

38:11.080 --> 38:16.080
Yeah, I invented the... No, I just... Yeah, I don't know, for whatever reason.

38:16.080 --> 38:18.080
You just finished making that up.

38:18.080 --> 38:21.080
I take over your job.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.080
Okay, well...

38:22.080 --> 38:24.080
No, I'm kidding. That's interesting.

38:24.080 --> 38:27.080
It's going to be the toughest shoes you'll ever fill.

38:27.080 --> 38:31.080
You'll have to learn how to not listen to people while you're interviewing them.

38:31.080 --> 38:41.080
That's interesting to me, though, because you're fantasizing about being on David Letterman,

38:41.080 --> 38:46.080
and he's just going, our next guest is Lisette, and let's bring her out.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.080
And you're like, hey!

38:48.080 --> 38:52.080
And he's like, that is an amazing dress you're wearing,

38:52.080 --> 38:54.080
and you talk about the dress and you tell some...

38:54.080 --> 38:58.080
The interesting thing about it to me is it makes me realize the people that are on Letterman

38:58.080 --> 39:02.080
are just plugging a movie, but it's not like they come out and do a scene from it.

39:02.080 --> 39:05.080
They just come out and they talk about parking tickets.

39:05.080 --> 39:08.080
Have you noticed that every interviewer has their different thing?

39:08.080 --> 39:11.080
Conan O'Brien lets pretty girls touch his hair.

39:11.080 --> 39:13.080
You want to touch his hair?

39:13.080 --> 39:16.080
He pretends that his hair is alive or whatever.

39:16.080 --> 39:19.080
David Letterman tends to hit on really pretty girls,

39:19.080 --> 39:21.080
and he makes awkward people feel even more awkward.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.080
He's kind of mean, but he's kind of nice at the same time.

39:23.080 --> 39:26.080
Maybe he just plays favorites, but I don't know.

39:26.080 --> 39:28.080
You could talk to him about that on the panel.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.080
You'd come out and you'd turn the tables on him,

39:30.080 --> 39:32.080
and he'd be like, wow, what's happening?

39:32.080 --> 39:36.080
And he'd be like, I'm Lisette, mother fucker.

39:36.080 --> 39:39.080
Well, thank you, Lisette, for sharing your information.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.080
Thank you.

39:47.080 --> 39:50.080
That was experienced wait-person, Lisette,

39:50.080 --> 39:53.080
on how to make a wait-person feel bad.

39:53.080 --> 39:56.080
I worked as a busboy once, and it was the worst.

39:56.080 --> 40:00.080
I was so bad at it, because I hate people.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.080
Busboys hate people?

40:02.080 --> 40:04.080
No, I hate people.

40:04.080 --> 40:07.080
I worked at a country club, and so it was just rich,

40:07.080 --> 40:09.080
rich white douchebags.

40:09.080 --> 40:12.080
And I was broke, and it was a terrible job.

40:12.080 --> 40:16.080
And one time I came out, and we had to build everything.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.080
You had to put a dance floor together,

40:18.080 --> 40:20.080
and they'd put sectional walls up

40:20.080 --> 40:22.080
and carry these giant tables out.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.080
And the time that the guests were there,

40:24.080 --> 40:26.080
you were exhausted and you were cut,

40:26.080 --> 40:28.080
we always had the band-aids on.

40:28.080 --> 40:30.080
I was serving food, it was totally gross,

40:30.080 --> 40:32.080
and I was carrying a tray out,

40:32.080 --> 40:36.080
and it had 15 or so little silver coffee creamer,

40:36.080 --> 40:38.080
like creamer tins in it.

40:38.080 --> 40:41.080
And I had to put one on each table,

40:41.080 --> 40:45.080
and I knocked, I was so tired and fatigued,

40:45.080 --> 40:48.080
I dropped it all over the back of a lady

40:48.080 --> 40:51.080
in a black velvet dress.

40:51.080 --> 40:53.080
And everybody lizzes.

40:53.080 --> 40:55.080
I felt bad, she felt bad, the husband felt bad,

40:55.080 --> 40:57.080
everyone in the world died a little bit.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.080
And the husband got up,

40:59.080 --> 41:01.080
and he just started screaming at me.

41:01.080 --> 41:04.080
And I wanted to disappear and die,

41:04.080 --> 41:06.080
and I'd do anything to make that not happen.

41:06.080 --> 41:08.080
I'm just blushing.

41:08.080 --> 41:10.080
And this guy, he's about a head shorter than me,

41:10.080 --> 41:13.080
but he's a big, stocky little fucker.

41:13.080 --> 41:15.080
He just turns purple, and he's like,

41:15.080 --> 41:17.080
God damn it, he just starts screaming at me.

41:17.080 --> 41:21.080
And the wife was covered in creamer tins.

41:21.080 --> 41:23.080
I'm covered in shame,

41:23.080 --> 41:25.080
and I just looked at the guy and I go,

41:25.080 --> 41:27.080
enough.

41:27.080 --> 41:29.080
And I put my finger in his face,

41:29.080 --> 41:32.080
and he kept yelling, I go, shut up.

41:32.080 --> 41:35.080
Like, you're yelling is not making her happier.

41:35.080 --> 41:38.080
Like, you need, I'm going to murder you,

41:38.080 --> 41:40.080
because you're making this worse.

41:40.080 --> 41:48.080
And then I called my manager a cunt, and I left.

41:48.080 --> 41:54.080
For those listening, Jeff just applauded himself.

41:54.080 --> 41:56.080
For those listening, I frequently am underneath the podium.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.080
I'm frequently applauding myself.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.080
I think every time I've ever quit a job,

42:00.080 --> 42:02.080
I've called somebody a cunt.

42:02.080 --> 42:04.080
It's better in England, right?

42:04.080 --> 42:06.080
It's more of a terrible word here.

42:06.080 --> 42:10.080
I meant it to hurt.

42:10.080 --> 42:11.080
I worked in a trade,

42:11.080 --> 42:14.080
I just stole everything.

42:14.080 --> 42:16.080
There's nothing worse you could call another man

42:16.080 --> 42:18.080
than the c-word,

42:18.080 --> 42:21.080
because it's a horrible word to call a woman.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.080
And then you're, so then you're calling a man.

42:23.080 --> 42:26.080
Like, when I've been really angry

42:26.080 --> 42:28.080
in like, kind of like,

42:28.080 --> 42:30.080
I can't even think of examples,

42:30.080 --> 42:32.080
but like when it's sort of like that primal

42:32.080 --> 42:34.080
man-on-man rage.

42:34.080 --> 42:37.080
Like, when I really want a guy to feel really terrible

42:37.080 --> 42:38.080
about himself,

42:38.080 --> 42:41.080
I call him the worst word you can call a woman,

42:41.080 --> 42:44.080
which is interesting.

42:44.080 --> 42:47.080
It's kind of the opposite of interesting.

42:47.080 --> 42:49.080
So like, the most obvious thing in the world.

42:49.080 --> 42:51.080
What was the last job you had,

42:51.080 --> 42:52.080
like before a writer,

42:52.080 --> 42:54.080
like the actual like, like a nine to five,

42:54.080 --> 42:56.080
or like an actual job job?

42:56.080 --> 42:59.080
The last time, I mean,

42:59.080 --> 43:02.080
I think it was as a data entry clerk,

43:02.080 --> 43:04.080
I think that was my last real job.

43:04.080 --> 43:05.080
I think after I quit that,

43:05.080 --> 43:07.080
I was like, I can't,

43:07.080 --> 43:09.080
because I was,

43:09.080 --> 43:12.080
like to run down my curriculum vitae.

43:12.080 --> 43:15.080
Is that how you say that?

43:15.080 --> 43:16.080
Yeah.

43:16.080 --> 43:18.080
A lot of resume writers here

43:18.080 --> 43:21.080
that have that on their CV.

43:21.080 --> 43:23.080
The,

43:23.080 --> 43:25.080
I was,

43:25.080 --> 43:27.080
I worked as a caddy at the,

43:27.080 --> 43:28.080
at a country club.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.080
It was awful.

43:29.080 --> 43:32.080
Like you're working for like way sub minimum wage.

43:32.080 --> 43:33.080
You have to get like this permit

43:33.080 --> 43:35.080
that allows you to be working

43:35.080 --> 43:37.080
for not really any money at all.

43:37.080 --> 43:39.080
And then, so you're just reliant on these tips.

43:39.080 --> 43:40.080
And it was like,

43:40.080 --> 43:41.080
this Milwaukee country club.

43:41.080 --> 43:42.080
It wasn't like,

43:42.080 --> 43:44.080
it wasn't like they were just like,

43:44.080 --> 43:45.080
throwing fifties around.

43:45.080 --> 43:47.080
Like they would just give you a dollar after you.

43:47.080 --> 43:48.080
I've had caddies before,

43:48.080 --> 43:49.080
like a nice course,

43:49.080 --> 43:50.080
as I friends are good golfers,

43:50.080 --> 43:51.080
and I get to go play with them.

43:51.080 --> 43:52.080
And the caddies are actually like,

43:52.080 --> 43:54.080
they help you read your putts.

43:54.080 --> 43:56.080
They tell you what club selection they give you.

43:56.080 --> 43:58.080
Do you have any golf knowledge?

43:58.080 --> 43:59.080
I would just fake it.

43:59.080 --> 44:00.080
I would go,

44:00.080 --> 44:01.080
cause like,

44:01.080 --> 44:03.080
cause the guy would go like,

44:03.080 --> 44:04.080
oh, you know,

44:04.080 --> 44:05.080
like I remember,

44:05.080 --> 44:07.080
I remember one triumph was the guy going like,

44:07.080 --> 44:08.080
so what do you think?

44:08.080 --> 44:09.080
Like,

44:09.080 --> 44:10.080
five wood.

44:10.080 --> 44:12.080
And I was like,

44:12.080 --> 44:13.080
ah,

44:13.080 --> 44:14.080
ah.

44:14.080 --> 44:15.080
I was like,

44:15.080 --> 44:16.080
ah, three,

44:16.080 --> 44:17.080
three, huh?

44:17.080 --> 44:18.080
And I was like,

44:18.080 --> 44:19.080
yeah,

44:19.080 --> 44:20.080
yeah.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.080
And then he,

44:21.080 --> 44:22.080
and then he hit it,

44:22.080 --> 44:23.080
and he got on the,

44:23.080 --> 44:24.080
got on the,

44:24.080 --> 44:26.080
across this body of water.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.080
It was like,

44:28.080 --> 44:29.080
it was like a river between the,

44:29.080 --> 44:30.080
I don't think he got on the green,

44:30.080 --> 44:31.080
but,

44:31.080 --> 44:32.080
but he,

44:32.080 --> 44:33.080
he was like,

44:33.080 --> 44:34.080
it landed,

44:34.080 --> 44:35.080
and then he was like,

44:35.080 --> 44:36.080
huh,

44:36.080 --> 44:37.080
ah,

44:37.080 --> 44:38.080
you were right.

44:38.080 --> 44:39.080
And he said,

44:39.080 --> 44:40.080
he said,

44:40.080 --> 44:41.080
if I used a five,

44:41.080 --> 44:42.080
I would have been swimming.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.080
And I was like,

44:43.080 --> 44:44.080
yeah,

44:44.080 --> 44:45.080
yeah.

44:45.080 --> 44:46.080
Oh yeah.

44:46.080 --> 44:47.080
You'd have been wet,

44:47.080 --> 44:48.080
Jack.

44:48.080 --> 44:49.080
Then you,

44:49.080 --> 44:50.080
then you need to get a snorkel,

44:50.080 --> 44:51.080
snorkel porker out.

44:51.080 --> 44:52.080
Snorkel porker.

44:52.080 --> 44:53.080
But you,

44:53.080 --> 44:54.080
you had to,

44:54.080 --> 44:55.080
you had to clean their clubs

44:55.080 --> 44:56.080
at the end of everything.

44:56.080 --> 44:57.080
It was like,

44:57.080 --> 44:58.080
like,

44:58.080 --> 44:59.080
like you could haul their clubs.

44:59.080 --> 45:00.080
That's some heavy shit, dude.

45:00.080 --> 45:01.080
Like,

45:01.080 --> 45:02.080
like a bag of golf clubs.

45:02.080 --> 45:03.080
And then,

45:03.080 --> 45:05.080
and then sometimes 18 holes.

45:05.080 --> 45:06.080
And then like,

45:06.080 --> 45:07.080
get,

45:07.080 --> 45:09.080
get it back to the so-called caddy shack,

45:09.080 --> 45:11.080
which is not as fun as it sounds.

45:11.080 --> 45:12.080
And,

45:12.080 --> 45:13.080
and,

45:13.080 --> 45:14.080
and,

45:14.080 --> 45:15.080
and,

45:15.080 --> 45:17.080
and wash the fucking grass stains

45:17.080 --> 45:18.080
out of the,

45:18.080 --> 45:20.080
out of the ridges in their clubs

45:20.080 --> 45:22.080
for 40 minutes with a toothbrush.

45:22.080 --> 45:24.080
And then eventually one of them,

45:24.080 --> 45:26.080
they'll come over and they'll give you a dollar.

45:26.080 --> 45:27.080
A dollar?

45:27.080 --> 45:29.080
Well, this was back in the 40s, right?

45:29.080 --> 45:30.080
This was,

45:30.080 --> 45:31.080
this was Carter dollars.

45:31.080 --> 45:32.080
They were,

45:32.080 --> 45:33.080
they were,

45:33.080 --> 45:34.080
they were,

45:34.080 --> 45:35.080
they weren't worth as much,

45:35.080 --> 45:36.080
but there was also no oil.

45:36.080 --> 45:37.080
I don't know.

45:37.080 --> 45:38.080
Uh,

45:40.080 --> 45:42.080
my longest job was a dishwasher

45:42.080 --> 45:44.080
at the rehab center.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.080
Uh,

45:45.080 --> 45:46.080
at Milwaukee.

45:46.080 --> 45:47.080
I would wash dishes.

45:47.080 --> 45:48.080
Spencer,

45:48.080 --> 45:49.080
do you miss your job at Apple?

45:49.080 --> 45:50.080
I miss the people.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.080
I think that a lot of the people I worked with

45:52.080 --> 45:53.080
were really awesome,

45:53.080 --> 45:56.080
but I don't miss like anything else about the job.

45:56.080 --> 45:58.080
Do you miss Steve Jobs?

45:58.080 --> 45:59.080
No.

45:59.080 --> 46:01.080
Did he ever come in and go like,

46:01.080 --> 46:02.080
Teamwork?

46:02.080 --> 46:03.080
Yeah.

46:03.080 --> 46:05.080
No, we hung out a few times.

46:07.080 --> 46:08.080
You lying?

46:08.080 --> 46:09.080
Yeah.

46:11.080 --> 46:12.080
I just,

46:12.080 --> 46:13.080
I answered the phones all the time.

46:13.080 --> 46:14.080
Like,

46:14.080 --> 46:15.080
like it is really stupid,

46:15.080 --> 46:16.080
like terrible stuff.

46:16.080 --> 46:17.080
So I mean,

46:17.080 --> 46:18.080
I,

46:18.080 --> 46:19.080
when I,

46:19.080 --> 46:20.080
when I applied for the job,

46:20.080 --> 46:21.080
I was like,

46:21.080 --> 46:22.080
how much phones are involved?

46:22.080 --> 46:23.080
One.

46:23.080 --> 46:24.080
And then I got hired and they're like,

46:24.080 --> 46:26.080
we're adjusting our positions.

46:26.080 --> 46:28.080
So you answered the phone now.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.080
So it was like,

46:29.080 --> 46:32.080
it was the worst possible situation for me

46:32.080 --> 46:34.080
because I hate dealing with idiots.

46:34.080 --> 46:35.080
I can't see.

46:38.080 --> 46:39.080
So, I mean,

46:39.080 --> 46:40.080
no, but it was really terrible.

46:40.080 --> 46:41.080
People would be all like,

46:41.080 --> 46:42.080
hey,

46:42.080 --> 46:44.080
I got an iPad.

46:44.080 --> 46:45.080
Okay.

46:46.080 --> 46:47.080
Yeah.

46:47.080 --> 46:48.080
It takes pictures.

46:48.080 --> 46:49.080
Yeah.

46:49.080 --> 46:50.080
Yeah.

46:50.080 --> 46:52.080
They don't even have anything to say.

46:54.080 --> 46:56.080
Just lonely people talking.

46:57.080 --> 46:59.080
It's just called to talk.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.080
I'm taking a picture of my phone.

47:05.080 --> 47:06.080
Yeah.

47:06.080 --> 47:08.080
So can you see me doing that?

47:12.080 --> 47:13.080
Well,

47:13.080 --> 47:14.080
let me,

47:14.080 --> 47:15.080
let me be,

47:15.080 --> 47:17.080
let me be an Apple phone answerer

47:17.080 --> 47:19.080
and you be the worst,

47:19.080 --> 47:21.080
the amalgam of all the Apple people

47:21.080 --> 47:22.080
or just an,

47:22.080 --> 47:24.080
or just an example of an Apple experience.

47:24.080 --> 47:25.080
You hate it.

47:25.080 --> 47:26.080
All right.

47:27.080 --> 47:29.080
Hello, Apple.

47:29.080 --> 47:30.080
Yeah.

47:30.080 --> 47:31.080
I got an iPad,

47:31.080 --> 47:33.080
three G's or something.

47:33.080 --> 47:34.080
I think it's a,

47:34.080 --> 47:36.080
it's got a touch pad on the top.

47:40.080 --> 47:42.080
Is this based in reality?

47:42.080 --> 47:43.080
Normally when there's icons,

47:43.080 --> 47:44.080
you see icons,

47:44.080 --> 47:46.080
but I'm just seeing a black Apple

47:46.080 --> 47:48.080
on a gray background.

47:48.080 --> 47:49.080
Oh,

47:49.080 --> 47:51.080
it sounds like your product is starting up.

47:51.080 --> 47:52.080
I know that.

47:52.080 --> 47:53.080
No,

47:53.080 --> 47:55.080
it's been like this since I got it.

47:57.080 --> 47:58.080
So is it,

47:58.080 --> 47:59.080
is it an iPad or?

47:59.080 --> 48:00.080
Yeah,

48:00.080 --> 48:01.080
it's on my table.

48:08.080 --> 48:09.080
Hold on,

48:09.080 --> 48:10.080
the kettle's going.

48:10.080 --> 48:11.080
Okay.

48:17.080 --> 48:18.080
I have a follow-up,

48:18.080 --> 48:19.080
I have a follow-up.

48:19.080 --> 48:20.080
Dan,

48:20.080 --> 48:21.080
can you be the Apple employee,

48:21.080 --> 48:23.080
but also be Cobra Commander at the same time?

48:24.080 --> 48:25.080
Okay.

48:25.080 --> 48:26.080
All right,

48:26.080 --> 48:27.080
new phone call.

48:27.080 --> 48:28.080
Now,

48:28.080 --> 48:29.080
Cobra,

48:29.080 --> 48:31.080
Cobra Command has done such a good job

48:31.080 --> 48:32.080
of running the country that now it's,

48:32.080 --> 48:33.080
yeah,

48:33.080 --> 48:35.080
Cobra Commander's just working at an Apple store.

48:36.080 --> 48:37.080
Ring, ring.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.080
I have been on 15 different lines

48:39.080 --> 48:41.080
I've been transferred seven times.

48:41.080 --> 48:43.080
I don't know how Apple products work.

48:43.080 --> 48:45.080
Your company is garbage.

48:45.080 --> 48:47.080
Can you give me all the free stuff?

48:50.080 --> 48:52.080
I appreciate your situation.

48:52.080 --> 48:53.080
Would you please,

48:53.080 --> 48:55.080
just relax for a moment.

48:55.080 --> 48:57.080
This is the first time I'm speaking to you.

48:57.080 --> 48:59.080
Your company has charged me four times

48:59.080 --> 49:00.080
in the last month

49:00.080 --> 49:02.080
for bills I haven't seen.

49:02.080 --> 49:04.080
I've never seen any certificates

49:04.080 --> 49:05.080
or receipts.

49:05.080 --> 49:07.080
I didn't even know I'd be charged

49:07.080 --> 49:09.080
for stuff like HBO.

49:12.080 --> 49:14.080
It sounds like you're describing something

49:14.080 --> 49:16.080
other than Apple, sir.

49:16.080 --> 49:18.080
This is the AT&T store.

49:18.080 --> 49:19.080
This is Apple.

49:19.080 --> 49:21.080
The AT&T store.

49:22.080 --> 49:23.080
I called AT&T corporate

49:23.080 --> 49:25.080
and they transferred me here.

49:32.080 --> 49:33.080
Later.

49:33.080 --> 49:34.080
Later.

49:36.080 --> 49:37.080
Hello, AT&T.

49:37.080 --> 49:39.080
This is Destro.

49:41.080 --> 49:43.080
He transfers all the AT&T calls

49:43.080 --> 49:44.080
to Cobra Commander

49:45.080 --> 49:46.080
because he hates him.

49:48.080 --> 49:50.080
There was some crazy shit going on

49:50.080 --> 49:51.080
in GI Joe, man.

49:51.080 --> 49:52.080
Right when they ended,

49:52.080 --> 49:54.080
that was when Destro

49:54.080 --> 49:56.080
and Professor Meinbender

49:56.080 --> 49:58.080
went off on the side

49:58.080 --> 49:59.080
and they were like,

49:59.080 --> 50:00.080
I don't think Cobra Commander's doing

50:00.080 --> 50:01.080
a very good job.

50:01.080 --> 50:03.080
They made Serpentor

50:03.080 --> 50:05.080
out of the DNA

50:05.080 --> 50:07.080
of, like,

50:07.080 --> 50:08.080
85 different, like,

50:08.080 --> 50:09.080
dictators

50:09.080 --> 50:11.080
except Hitler.

50:11.080 --> 50:13.080
But it's like the elephant in the room.

50:13.080 --> 50:14.080
They're like,

50:14.080 --> 50:16.080
we're going to get a till of the hood

50:16.080 --> 50:17.080
and Genghis Khan

50:17.080 --> 50:18.080
and you're like a kid going,

50:18.080 --> 50:19.080
what about Hitler?

50:22.080 --> 50:23.080
Yeah.

50:23.080 --> 50:24.080
We're not tooth bags.

50:26.080 --> 50:27.080
Napoleon

50:27.080 --> 50:29.080
and Alexander,

50:29.080 --> 50:31.080
the great

50:31.080 --> 50:33.080
Vlad the Impaler was in there

50:33.080 --> 50:35.080
and then they

50:35.080 --> 50:37.080
somebody was like, yeah.

50:37.080 --> 50:39.080
They,

50:39.080 --> 50:41.080
and they activated Serpentor

50:41.080 --> 50:43.080
and

50:43.080 --> 50:45.080
he, of course,

50:45.080 --> 50:47.080
they put some frog DNA in there

50:47.080 --> 50:49.080
or something that made Serpentor,

50:49.080 --> 50:51.080
like, really unruly.

50:51.080 --> 50:53.080
So then, toward the end

50:53.080 --> 50:55.080
of GI Joe, like,

50:55.080 --> 50:57.080
Destro was going back to Cobra

50:57.080 --> 50:59.080
Commander and going, I'm sorry.

50:59.080 --> 51:01.080
I've kind of fucked up.

51:01.080 --> 51:02.080
And they were forming like a new,

51:02.080 --> 51:04.080
there were like three organizations

51:04.080 --> 51:05.080
that were all fighting each other.

51:05.080 --> 51:06.080
The thing about GI Joe is

51:06.080 --> 51:08.080
GI Joe had its shit together,

51:08.080 --> 51:10.080
ran the government

51:10.080 --> 51:12.080
and there was no infighting

51:12.080 --> 51:14.080
and then Cobra was just like,

51:14.080 --> 51:16.080
you couldn't get through a day over there.

51:16.080 --> 51:17.080
It was just like,

51:17.080 --> 51:19.080
why are you always implying

51:19.080 --> 51:20.080
that I'm not good?

51:20.080 --> 51:21.080
I didn't say that.

51:21.080 --> 51:23.080
I just think we should send

51:23.080 --> 51:25.080
the microchips to the rockets.

51:25.080 --> 51:27.080
They were like, oh, your insolence

51:27.080 --> 51:29.080
will be demanded.

51:29.080 --> 51:31.080
They were their own worst enemy.

51:31.080 --> 51:33.080
Your insolence will be what?

51:33.080 --> 51:35.080
Demanded, I don't know.

51:35.080 --> 51:37.080
They were self-destructive, I'm telling you.

51:37.080 --> 51:39.080
They demanded insolence.

51:39.080 --> 51:41.080
All right.

51:41.080 --> 51:43.080
Spencer, do you think you're ever going to get married?

51:43.080 --> 51:45.080
I mean, God willing.

51:45.080 --> 51:47.080
You want to be married?

51:47.080 --> 51:48.080
Sure.

51:48.080 --> 51:50.080
And religiously, of course.

51:50.080 --> 51:52.080
Yeah, I was going to say

51:52.080 --> 51:54.080
only religiously, but that's not very funny.

51:54.080 --> 51:56.080
Where would your ideal wedding take place?

51:56.080 --> 51:58.080
I don't care.

51:58.080 --> 52:00.080
Why does that matter?

52:00.080 --> 52:02.080
It's supposed to be for the bride, right?

52:02.080 --> 52:04.080
Well, for both.

52:04.080 --> 52:06.080
I say for the people that have to sit there.

52:06.080 --> 52:08.080
Well, fuck them.

52:08.080 --> 52:10.080
No, the whole inviting them to the wedding

52:10.080 --> 52:11.080
is fuck them.

52:11.080 --> 52:13.080
When they get there, they want to get drunk

52:13.080 --> 52:14.080
and they won't.

52:14.080 --> 52:16.080
That would be pretty good, though, to have

52:16.080 --> 52:18.080
a Raiders of the Lost Ark wedding,

52:18.080 --> 52:20.080
but you have to make everyone that comes,

52:20.080 --> 52:22.080
including grandma and grandpa,

52:22.080 --> 52:24.080
and then they all get melted.

52:26.080 --> 52:28.080
There's all these pyrotechnics and stuff,

52:28.080 --> 52:30.080
and then these light beams go through their torsos.

52:34.080 --> 52:36.080
Yeah, I just think, I mean, I wouldn't mind...

52:36.080 --> 52:38.080
I kind of want

52:38.080 --> 52:40.080
there to be a character

52:40.080 --> 52:42.080
at my wedding.

52:42.080 --> 52:44.080
Not even just at the reception.

52:46.080 --> 52:48.080
At the actual, you know, that idea of

52:48.080 --> 52:50.080
you're getting married

52:50.080 --> 52:52.080
and then someone comes in

52:52.080 --> 52:54.080
from the back and says, like,

52:54.080 --> 52:56.080
I don't think they should get married,

52:56.080 --> 52:58.080
and then, like, you sort and fight them.

52:58.080 --> 53:00.080
And then you get married.

53:00.080 --> 53:02.080
Just so that the audience has something.

53:02.080 --> 53:04.080
I've been a guy in the drawing.

53:04.080 --> 53:06.080
His wife is Scottish

53:06.080 --> 53:08.080
and they got married in Scotland,

53:08.080 --> 53:10.080
and the ring bearer was the owl

53:10.080 --> 53:12.080
from...

53:12.080 --> 53:14.080
What's the owl from Harry Potter?

53:14.080 --> 53:16.080
Yeah, like, he fucking flew in

53:16.080 --> 53:18.080
and brought the ring.

53:18.080 --> 53:20.080
And there's a picture of

53:20.080 --> 53:22.080
the owl flying in

53:22.080 --> 53:24.080
with the ring, and the crowd's like,

53:24.080 --> 53:26.080
what the fuck?

53:26.080 --> 53:28.080
Is that headwind?

53:28.080 --> 53:30.080
Or headwind?

53:30.080 --> 53:32.080
So you got to outdo that.

53:32.080 --> 53:34.080
You got the budget.

53:34.080 --> 53:36.080
Yeah, but I want a nest egg.

53:36.080 --> 53:38.080
I'm going to become very miserly,

53:38.080 --> 53:40.080
because I want to retire

53:40.080 --> 53:42.080
and I don't want to have to

53:42.080 --> 53:44.080
worry about running out of money.

53:44.080 --> 53:46.080
So I'm going to become very

53:46.080 --> 53:48.080
thrifty.

53:48.080 --> 53:50.080
I'm just going to get married

53:50.080 --> 53:52.080
and stack

53:52.080 --> 53:54.080
a bunch of milk crates

53:54.080 --> 53:56.080
and

53:56.080 --> 53:58.080
knock them down and then say,

53:58.080 --> 54:00.080
I do.

54:00.080 --> 54:02.080
The ring will be in one of the crates,

54:02.080 --> 54:04.080
I don't know.

54:04.080 --> 54:06.080
You guys going to have kids?

54:06.080 --> 54:08.080
That to me is the larger

54:08.080 --> 54:10.080
point of getting married.

54:10.080 --> 54:12.080
Although Rob, Schrab, and Kate throwing,

54:12.080 --> 54:14.080
they don't seem to have any plans to have kids,

54:14.080 --> 54:16.080
they were together for so long,

54:16.080 --> 54:18.080
as Rob said very touchingly.

54:18.080 --> 54:20.080
He had run out of ways to

54:20.080 --> 54:22.080
make her understand how much he loved her,

54:22.080 --> 54:24.080
and so they decided to get married.

54:24.080 --> 54:26.080
Which was one of the most romantic weddings in the world,

54:26.080 --> 54:28.080
because they didn't have to.

54:28.080 --> 54:30.080
It wasn't like a precursor to having kids

54:30.080 --> 54:32.080
that it weren't divorced, as usually is the case.

54:32.080 --> 54:34.080
You knew

54:34.080 --> 54:36.080
that they were going to be together forever,

54:36.080 --> 54:38.080
because they didn't have to get married.

54:38.080 --> 54:40.080
They already lived together for like eight years,

54:40.080 --> 54:42.080
and then they were just getting married,

54:42.080 --> 54:44.080
and that was the first wedding I was at,

54:44.080 --> 54:46.080
that I was like, holy shit, this is the real deal.

54:46.080 --> 54:48.080
You guys should get married to Harmontown.

54:48.080 --> 54:50.080
It just seems a little tacky.

54:50.080 --> 54:52.080
Not that you applauded something tacky,

54:52.080 --> 54:54.080
for those of you who started applauding.

54:54.080 --> 54:56.080
It's like Tiny Tim getting married

54:56.080 --> 54:58.080
on Carson or something.

54:58.080 --> 55:00.080
What was that?

55:00.080 --> 55:02.080
What?

55:02.080 --> 55:04.080
He's referencing some old shit.

55:04.080 --> 55:06.080
Uh,

55:06.080 --> 55:08.080
you know, it's like,

55:10.080 --> 55:12.080
Adam, are you going to get married?

55:12.080 --> 55:14.080
Sure, why not.

55:14.080 --> 55:16.080
Okay.

55:16.080 --> 55:18.080
Geez.

55:18.080 --> 55:20.080
She's not.

55:24.080 --> 55:26.080
What would be the most romantic wedding?

55:26.080 --> 55:28.080
How would you get married?

55:28.080 --> 55:30.080
I was in Barcelona once,

55:30.080 --> 55:32.080
when I was really broke,

55:32.080 --> 55:34.080
and I was on a cruise ship,

55:34.080 --> 55:36.080
and we made a bunch of money on the ship,

55:36.080 --> 55:38.080
and I just took the money I made

55:38.080 --> 55:40.080
and stayed in Barcelona for a few days.

55:40.080 --> 55:42.080
And I was walking around the Gothic Quarter,

55:42.080 --> 55:44.080
and it's like very narrow streets,

55:44.080 --> 55:46.080
and there's like Salvador Dalí,

55:46.080 --> 55:48.080
you know, like exhibits and stuff,

55:48.080 --> 55:50.080
and there's really cool little fruit stands,

55:50.080 --> 55:52.080
and then it opened up into this big square,

55:52.080 --> 55:54.080
and there was like, the streets are so narrow,

55:54.080 --> 55:56.080
you can't really see the top of buildings,

55:56.080 --> 55:58.080
and I walked in, and it was the biggest cathedral in the world.

55:58.080 --> 56:00.080
It was just like this enormous,

56:00.080 --> 56:02.080
huge cathedral, and there was a choir singing

56:02.080 --> 56:04.080
from somewhere.

56:04.080 --> 56:06.080
You couldn't even see where the choir was,

56:06.080 --> 56:08.080
and on the far side, there was a wedding going on.

56:08.080 --> 56:10.080
There was like 12 people there.

56:10.080 --> 56:12.080
In the back, there were old ladies lighting candles,

56:12.080 --> 56:14.080
and it was very Catholic and doing that,

56:14.080 --> 56:16.080
but in the distance, it was like falsetto choir singing,

56:16.080 --> 56:18.080
and there was a wedding going on.

56:18.080 --> 56:20.080
There was doves flying around in the rafters,

56:20.080 --> 56:22.080
and it was really lonely and like somber,

56:22.080 --> 56:24.080
and I thought that's how I would do it.

56:24.080 --> 56:26.080
And I would invite like a few people,

56:26.080 --> 56:28.080
and I would come back to LA,

56:28.080 --> 56:30.080
and have a big party for everybody else,

56:30.080 --> 56:32.080
but whoever wanted to come out to

56:32.080 --> 56:34.080
like, whatever part of Europe or wherever

56:34.080 --> 56:36.080
we found the cool castle, we would do it there.

56:36.080 --> 56:38.080
Hmm, alright.

56:45.080 --> 56:47.080
He's applauded himself.

56:47.080 --> 56:49.080
I'll see if I can make it.

56:49.080 --> 56:51.080
I don't know.

56:53.080 --> 56:55.080
Sounds a little...

56:55.080 --> 56:58.080
It's knobby.

56:59.080 --> 57:01.080
You're invited.

57:02.080 --> 57:04.080
I don't know if I'd fit in.

57:05.080 --> 57:07.080
Seems a little fancy,

57:07.080 --> 57:10.080
but it's like a coffee commercial.

57:13.080 --> 57:15.080
Exactly, this would be IP.

57:15.080 --> 57:17.080
You'd love it because nothing would be required of you.

57:17.080 --> 57:19.080
You would just come, and then it would be over,

57:19.080 --> 57:21.080
and then we'd all go out and have a drink.

57:21.080 --> 57:22.080
Alright.

57:22.080 --> 57:25.080
You got me at the close.

57:25.080 --> 57:27.080
Alright, well, why don't we roll into

57:27.080 --> 57:29.080
our role-playing adventure?

57:29.080 --> 57:30.080
Let's do it.

57:30.080 --> 57:32.080
Nice and early.

57:32.080 --> 57:34.080
Are we bringing up guests to play Camille

57:34.080 --> 57:36.080
or Erin, or should we just go...

57:36.080 --> 57:37.080
What do you think, Spencer?

57:37.080 --> 57:38.080
Al fresco.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.080
Whatever you guys want.

57:39.080 --> 57:40.080
Ah, come on.

57:40.080 --> 57:43.080
Have a opinion.

57:44.080 --> 57:46.080
I'm dying.

57:47.080 --> 57:48.080
You're dying?

57:48.080 --> 57:52.080
It's more of like an observation, really.

57:53.080 --> 57:55.080
Not really an opinion.

57:57.080 --> 57:59.080
Are you really dying, Spencer?

57:59.080 --> 58:01.080
Nah, I'm cool.

58:01.080 --> 58:03.080
Were you bummed when Steve Jobs died?

58:03.080 --> 58:05.080
No, no.

58:07.080 --> 58:08.080
Quite the opposite.

58:08.080 --> 58:09.080
I'm actually...

58:09.080 --> 58:12.080
I'm more bothered by it now, like, retroactively

58:12.080 --> 58:14.080
than I was when it, like, happened.

58:14.080 --> 58:16.080
Because it affected the health plan?

58:16.080 --> 58:18.080
No, I mean, that didn't happen, like,

58:18.080 --> 58:20.080
I don't even think I got a job until after he died

58:20.080 --> 58:21.080
or whatever.

58:21.080 --> 58:24.080
I mean, I don't know, but it's just...

58:24.080 --> 58:27.080
I mean, he was like a genius.

58:27.080 --> 58:28.080
Yeah, he's a visionary.

58:28.080 --> 58:30.080
Yeah, there's not too many people like that,

58:30.080 --> 58:32.080
and it's like, you know, the world can kind of

58:32.080 --> 58:35.080
spin its wheels and, like, march in exerably forward,

58:35.080 --> 58:38.080
but all the good leaps are by some crazy cool guy

58:38.080 --> 58:40.080
that, like, leads people.

58:40.080 --> 58:42.080
You kind of pointed at me when you said that.

58:42.080 --> 58:44.080
Yeah.

58:44.080 --> 58:48.080
What I'm trying to say is it takes a special kind of person

58:48.080 --> 58:50.080
with a special kind of charisma.

58:50.080 --> 58:51.080
He didn't point at you.

58:51.080 --> 58:53.080
His hand moved toward his backpack.

58:53.080 --> 58:55.080
No, he just kind of flicked his wrist a little bit.

58:55.080 --> 58:56.080
I felt like it was pointing at me.

58:56.080 --> 58:58.080
A perceived point.

58:58.080 --> 59:00.080
Well, you know, Jeff, the world can move

59:00.080 --> 59:03.080
in exerably forward, but the kinds of people

59:03.080 --> 59:06.080
who decide they want to be pointed at

59:06.080 --> 59:09.080
get pointed at.

59:09.080 --> 59:12.080
I'm the Steve Jobs of thinking people

59:12.080 --> 59:16.080
are pointing at me.

59:16.080 --> 59:19.080
I don't know how I went down this rabbit hole,

59:19.080 --> 59:26.080
but I was looking at quotes from him and stuff.

59:26.080 --> 59:28.080
This is really a very interesting guy.

59:28.080 --> 59:30.080
Isn't there a biopic coming out about him?

59:30.080 --> 59:32.080
Isn't Ashton Kutcher playing that?

59:32.080 --> 59:34.080
Yeah, he's a trainwreck.

59:34.080 --> 59:36.080
I don't know why that's a bummer, but it is.

59:36.080 --> 59:38.080
Ashton Kutcher won the Teen Choice Award.

59:38.080 --> 59:40.080
There's a video that went kind of viral

59:40.080 --> 59:42.080
of Ashton Kutcher winning his Teen Choice Award,

59:42.080 --> 59:46.080
and he went up and he broke it down.

59:46.080 --> 59:49.080
He said that his first name is not Ashton.

59:49.080 --> 59:51.080
That's Chris or something.

59:51.080 --> 59:54.080
Chris Kutcher.

59:54.080 --> 59:56.080
It occurs to me, Anatoly, that that is what...

59:56.080 --> 59:58.080
Okay, this is a fucking deep-cut

59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.080
Harmontown reference, but when Anatoly

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.080
was at the Rick and Morty panel at Comic-Con

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.080
and you were pointing at your shirt

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.080
you had an Archer t-shirt on,

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.080
that's what I thought you were saying.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.080
Ashton Kutcher.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.080
Ashton Kutcher.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.080
Anyways.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.080
But Ashton Kutcher went up and he...

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.080
You know, there's just 16-year-old girls

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.080
screaming the whole time he's talking,

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.080
but he decided to

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.080
profess the virtues of hard labor

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.080
and creativity.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.080
He said, I never had a job

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.080
that I felt above.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.080
I've swept floors,

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.080
I've done this, I've done that,

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.080
and I never felt like I was above my job.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.080
I just worked hard and tried to get a better job,

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.080
which is sort of,

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.080
you know, it's not very subversive,

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.080
but

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.080
I guess it's better than everyone dreams

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.080
so you can have a limo too.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.080
And then he...

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.080
The nicer thing was that he really

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.080
espoused the virtues of

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.080
being a proactive, creative thinker.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.080
He said, you know,

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.080
you don't live within the world

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.080
that you're going into.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.080
You don't get it as a thing that needs to be expanded

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.080
and built upon.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.080
Go to the moon, Dan Harmon, he said.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.080
So when you're at home,

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.080
Jimmy's watching the Teen Choice Awards.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.080
I'm like, wait a minute,

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.080
there's no teens on here.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.080
Back to 4chan.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.080
I misinterpreted the title of this thing entirely.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:34.080
This is a bunch of old guys accepting awards.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.080
But anyways, Ashton Kutcher.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.080
His name's not Ashton.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.080
And he's going to be playing Steve Jobs,

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.080
who I just found out years after he died

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.080
was an interesting guy.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.080
It was right under my nose that he was

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.080
using all his products,

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.080
calling Spencer at work,

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.080
just to tell him that

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.080
there's a camera in it.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.080
Let's do this.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.080
So no people then?

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.080
So you want people up there?

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.080
No, I'm just clarifying.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.080
Seems like he wants people.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.080
What should we base our who we bring up on?

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.080
I know the subreddit,

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.080
the Harmontown subreddit,

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.080
was very enthralled with young Tyler last week.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.080
Is it a meritocracy?

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.080
Does he just earn another chance

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.080
on the wheel?

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.080
I think he earned it.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.080
Maybe we bring Tyler up

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.080
and we bring someone new up.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.080
Okay.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.080
What's that?

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.080
Tyler and Lizette, would you like to play?

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.080
Sure.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.080
Okay.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.080
Hi.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.080
Hi, how are you?

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.080
Spencer, just to make things different,

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.080
the description of the catch is up to date.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.080
Can we do it to the song?

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.080
Can we?

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.080
Yeah, sure, why not?

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.080
I'm going to start it from the top.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.080
I should hope so.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.080
The character shoots are being dispensered?

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.080
Thank you, Tyler.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.080
There's like three name puns that exist for me

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.080
and I've heard them all.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.080
What are the other two?

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.080
I have no idea.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.080
I'm not going to abuse that power.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.080
I just want to know what the other two are.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.080
Yeah, I know, but no one that will ever hear this

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.080
interacts with me on any level or medium.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.080
Would you rather simply

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.080
arm us and be done with it

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.080
or sit through the next 10-minute brainstorming session?

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.080
Because the suspense is killing me.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.080
Two out of three.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.080
It sounds like dispensership.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.080
That's the third.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.080
No, that's the...

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.080
Dispensership?

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.080
Well, you already did dispensership.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.080
He was doing censorship.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.080
Yeah, no.

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.080
I'm done.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.080
Sounds like you had it really bad.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.080
My last name rhymed

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.080
with the lead

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.080
selling toilet paper.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.080
There was commercials all over the...

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.080
Did anyone literally call you

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.080
don't squeeze the Harmon?

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.080
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.080
Every day.

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.080
You guys are too young to remember.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.080
There was this guy, Mr. Whipple.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.080
Apparently, people loved wiping their ass

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.080
in the 70s.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.080
There's that cartoon bear now,

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.080
which I think is interesting.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.080
People latch on

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.080
to pop culture references

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.080
just to make fun of you.

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.080
I'm Tyler and on the late end of high school

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.080
that was coming up like, oh, what's up, Tyler Durden?

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.080
I'm like, I'm not insulted?

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.080
Yeah, that's just

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.080
future Verizon employees just exercising

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.080
their little muscle

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.080
in the back of their spine.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:58.080
Lisette, did you get teased?

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.080
Did your name rhyme with anything funny?

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.080
Or is there a Lisette tease?

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.080
I got teased in high school

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.080
because I was really tall and skinny

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.080
and I had perfect skin and really nice hair.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:10.080
She is very beautiful

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.080
for the record.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.080
I was about to tease you

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.080
for the same reasons.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.080
She's so pretty.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.080
I looked relatively normal

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.080
but the second I opened my mouth

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.080
it was like, oh, she's a dork. Never mind.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.080
She looks okay, but she's pretty nerdy,

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.080
so yeah, I got made fun of

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.080
numerous times, numerous.

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:32.080
The worst one I ever heard

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.080
was about this girl, Leah.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.080
I don't know if it was JD's wife

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.080
or I was

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.080
having this conversation with a woman

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.080
named Leah

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.080
and

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.080
we were talking about, well, what was the

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.080
horrible thing they said about you on the playground?

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.080
She was like, man, I had the worst

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.080
and I thought of her name and I was like, what, Princess Leah?

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.080
What? She was like,

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.080
Leotard.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.080
They called her Leotard.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.080
The first thing that came to mind was like, Dyer,

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.080
Leah? Diarrhea.

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:06.080
Such a pretty name

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.080
and then so maligned.

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.080
Yeah, if you want to name a kid

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.080
a name that cannot be teased, Jeff Davis,

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.080
nothing funny rhymes with that.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.080
It's...

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.080
Jeff Gavis.

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.080
Gavis, yeah, but it's like, it doesn't really

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.080
hurt you because you're so gay.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.080
Which is great.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.080
Because gay people are amazing.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.080
That wedding you described, super gay.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.080
Oh, yeah, I'm going to marry a dude there.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.080
Have you ever been to a gay wedding?

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.080
Uh, yeah.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.080
No, I haven't.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.080
Have you? No.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.080
I don't think. Are you proposing?

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.080
Am I what? Am I proposing?

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.080
Have you ever been to a gay wedding?

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.080
Would you like to?

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.080
Let's have a gay wedding right now.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.080
I extend a hand.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.080
You open up a jack-o'-lantern and there's a ring.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.080
Also happy Halloween, apparently.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.080
I don't know.

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.080
No, I don't think I have...

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.080
That's not true. I've actually been...

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.080
I have been to a gay wedding.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.080
I guess it's a good sign that I can't really

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.080
remember.

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.080
Oh, you're an alcoholic.

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.080
Yeah, I mean, I don't have a good memory,

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:18.080
but that's a good sign

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.080
that I wasn't like,

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.080
fuck, I'll never forget that gay wedding!

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.080
It was so gay!

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.080
It was like, you know, if I was

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.080
at a gay wedding, two men

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.080
decided to spend the rest of their lives together

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:34.080
and blend it into the other people.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.080
All weddings are gay.

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.080
They are the gayest things that street people can ever do.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.080
Which is another reason

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.080
why gay marriage should absolutely be a thing.

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.080
It's like, let these people

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.080
into their house.

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.080
They've been planning all of our weddings forever.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.080
Exactly.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.080
That's the thing.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.080
So in a normal wedding, the dudes pretty much just

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:56.080
hands off whatever you do, whatever you want to do, honey.

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:58.080
Is it in the situation of a gay wedding where

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:00.080
they're both really hands-on and that's even worse?

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.080
No, I think in most couples,

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.080
there's always the male

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.080
archetype and the female archetype, regardless of

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.080
what your sex is, I think.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.080
Maybe I'm just saying because

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.080
my, okay, I'm sorry,

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.080
but my lovely

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.080
my lovely cousin who is gay

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.080
was going to marry his boyfriend,

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.080
but, you know,

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.080
I'm allowed an opinion and I just think

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.080
that most couples are the dude and there's the girl

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.080
regardless of what sex you are, that could

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.080
be an archetype, I'm just saying,

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.080
so I'm allowed an opinion so y'all can suck it, okay?

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.080
I was very defensive about that.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.080
I don't like being told that I'm wrong and even if I'm wrong,

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.080
disrespect the fact that I'm up here talking.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.080
Thank you, I'm just saying.

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.080
Who was groaning out there?

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.080
You, ma'am, you just agree with that?

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.080
That there's a male and female archetype?

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.080
I mean, it's just not true.

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.080
Yeah, it's just not true.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.080
That's a stereotype that's existed.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.080
Well, nothing's true that you're going to say

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.080
about everybody, yeah, so.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.080
Yeah, I just think it's unfair to make

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.080
those sorts of generalizations,

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.080
and as someone who

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.080
is queer and who knows

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.080
or has experienced a fair amount of gay weddings,

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.080
there are plenty of people where both members

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.080
of the couple are instantly involved with all

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.080
of the planning, and straight weddings, too.

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.080
Like, my friends just got married,

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.080
they were both

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.080
totally hands-on, so, you know.

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.080
That's one of the first questions

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.080
that straight people have about gay people is,

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.080
is there a,

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.080
whether it's a lesbian couple

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.080
or a gay male couple,

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.080
that's the first question is,

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.080
is there a hierarchy?

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.080
But really, the obvious answer is,

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.080
because I'm in a relationship where

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.080
there's no clear hierarchy.

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.080
Like, I'm not.

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.080
So obviously, there's not going to be always

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.080
a

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.080
dude

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.080
and a, I don't even know

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.080
how to use the language without a...

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.080
I said I'd marry you, dude.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.080
Do you think that's like the rationalization

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.080
of straight people who don't know

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.080
any better, where it's just like, I don't,

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.080
you're the same, like, what do you use to do, right?

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.080
Well, I don't think it's just the observation bias.

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.080
I'll apologize for the generalization,

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.080
I'm sorry, but

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.080
it could be that one's more passive

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.080
and one's more controlling,

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.080
regardless of...

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.080
No matter what you say, Lizette, they're always going to just...

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.080
Regardless of your gender, I'm just saying, you know,

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.080
some couples, I've met a lot of couples in my life,

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.080
some people are more passive,

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.080
and of the two, one's more passive,

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.080
one could be more passive, one could be more

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:30.080
controlling. I'll say could as

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.080
not to generalize.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.080
Versatile is the word.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.080
Not everybody is versatile, unfortunately,

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.080
but okay, sure, let's go with that.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.080
It's almost as if these relationships

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.080
aren't defined by the sexualities

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.080
of the parties. Exactly!

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.080
You're absolutely right.

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.080
That's why I apologize for the generalization,

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.080
but could it not be...

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.080
Could it not be...

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.080
Would it not be...

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.080
What?

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.080
You're digging yourself a hole.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.080
Would it be a bad...

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.080
Okay, if you're going to make your...

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.080
Wait a second, hold on.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.080
I think they want you to let it go.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:14.080
All I wanted to say was that if you had...

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.080
When Adam Goldberg is heckling you,

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.080
that is an indictment.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:40.080
All right, let's play some D&D Spencer, shall we?

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.080
I'd like to revisit the last topic.

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.080
No, no.

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.080
Last time on Harmontown, D.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.080
And D.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.080
After leaving the frozen city of

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.080
Farnheim and plunging into

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.080
an icy canyon to the north,

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.080
our heroes managed

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.080
to avoid the chilling effects

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.080
of nature through a combination

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.080
of theatrics and magical resistances

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.080
to cold weather.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.080
Having bargained for the fragments of power...

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:10.080
Having bargained...

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.080
Having bargained away the fragments of power

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.080
for Sharpie's life and as well as

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.080
the detachment of summoned skeletons,

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.080
the band was merry and in great spirits

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:20.080
until they heard a noise behind them.

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.080
It was Yerch.

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.080
Yes, the urine-soaked knoll was back

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.080
and warned of a demonic outpost just beyond.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.080
A massive wall jammed into the ice,

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.080
guarded by monsters and demons.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.080
The party taunted and ambushed

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.080
some of the gate guards, causing the black gate

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.080
to open and a massive ogre

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.080
bearing archers on its back

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.080
lumbered out.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.080
After a painful prostate

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.080
stimulation by Mulraine's tree token

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.080
and a volley of fireballs

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.080
and other flaming backpacks,

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.080
Quark got into the ogre's pants.

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.080
A few more flaming bolts to the brainstem

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.080
and the ogre was down.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.080
That's pretty much it.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.080
Alright, thank you for that.

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.080
So yeah, you just killed that ogre.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.080
Is the gate still open right now?

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.080
Yeah, you've just killed the ogre

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.080
and you stand at the open gate through the icy canyon.

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:18.080
There's some guards

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.080
and demons remaining on this gate

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.080
but they're kind of up a few stories

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.080
tall and it's open right now.

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.080
Do they look like they're trying to stop us

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.080
or are they like, oh shit, they killed an ogre.

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.080
We're not going to mess with them.

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.080
They look like they're off balance

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.080
and as I'm speaking this is happening

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.080
they start to tumble and fall off the gate

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.080
as it starts to swing wider open.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.080
But now you see all these dudes

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.080
kind of plummeting from the gate onto the icy floor

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.080
and they're just hitting the ground.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.080
Crunch.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.080
Smash.

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.080
Splat.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:52.080
Nope, damn it.

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:54.080
Let's go through the gate you guys.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.080
Let's do it.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.080
Skeleton army, hold.

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:00.080
Alright.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.080
You head forward.

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.080
Have we lost any skeletons?

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.080
Do we still have the full complement of skeletons?

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.080
They were kind of scarce in the ogre battle.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.080
I don't think you lost any.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:12.080
So you're heading up this icy slope

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.080
beyond this gate

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.080
and you can see at the top of the slope

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.080
the reflection of the sun is kind of

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.080
blinding you and making it hard to see forward.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.080
Be blind now.

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.080
We're blind?

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.080
Nah, you just can't see very well.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.080
Can we have an estimation of how high it goes?

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.080
It's just into the abyss.

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.080
You would if you weren't so blinded.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.080
Son of a bitch.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.080
Yeah.

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.080
Can I send Avenger up

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.080
as the weather quelled a little bit?

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.080
Avenger, go straight up

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.080
and spy.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.080
You send Avenger straight up

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.080
to spy.

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.080
And after some time

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.080
he comes back.

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.080
He gives you a look that says

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.080
I went up there and what I saw

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:02.080
I can't really repeat except I can.

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.080
It was a bunch of demons.

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.080
It was like an army of demons

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.080
and demonic creatures all standing outside

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.080
this big black fox who's the black keep.

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:12.080
See?

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.080
Is your bird

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.080
kind of a gangster

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.080
for like a...

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.080
Yeah.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.080
Shit.

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.080
Avenger saw a bunch of

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.080
there's an army of demons on the other side of this gate.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.080
How many?

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.080
An army.

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.080
An army of demons.

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.080
Yep.

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.080
Over 10, Avenger?

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.080
Over 10.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.080
Under 40?

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.080
Under 40.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.080
So is this like the main black fortress

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.080
where supposedly Animal Dark Star is?

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:48.080
Who are you talking to?

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:50.080
My party members.

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.080
Yes.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.080
Right? Yeah.

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.080
This is the black keep, right?

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.080
Yeah.

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.080
Do we have a large enough army?

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.080
We have us and 40 skeletons

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.080
and if there's to be tons of them.

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.080
Less than 40.

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.080
Less than 40. More than 10.

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.080
Doesn't seem like we're in a good position.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.080
We can take them.

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.080
Mulrainee feels confident about this.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.080
I think we need someone in our party

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.080
who has the sexuality type

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.080
to plan this attack.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.080
And the rest of us

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:24.080
could be a little more laid back about it.

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:30.080
I'm not saying that the only woman

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:32.080
should be the one that plans the attack.

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.080
I'm just saying that it tends to be the woman

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:36.080
that wants to plan attacks.

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.080
I think it should be

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.080
you.

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.080
Oh, really? Yeah.

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.080
Are you a master strategist?

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.080
I'm a barbarian.

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.080
My strategy is going to be to run in there

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.080
willy-nilly and go in there and just start kicking ass.

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.080
That sounds terrible.

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.080
But you have a sensitivity in your eyes.

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.080
Well, thank you.

01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.080
I mean,

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.080
I'm going to knock on the gate.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.080
We're already through the gate.

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.080
What do you mean through it?

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.080
The gate's open.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.080
We're through the gate.

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:10.080
I'm not a visual learner.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.080
Big Hill.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.080
Auditory.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.080
Fortress.

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.080
I guess you're a caveman learner.

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.080
I organized the skeleton army

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:22.080
into a hoplite.

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.080
Like a chevron-shaped

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.080
attack formation.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.080
Sure, a chevron.

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.080
A phalanx.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.080
Different, but similar.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:37.080
Yeah, really different.

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:39.080
I'm sorry.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.080
Yeah, yeah, a lot more accurate than phalanx.

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.080
Okay, a hoplite.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.080
Yeah, that happens.

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.080
They're arranged.

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.080
March, I say March.

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.080
You say March.

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:55.080
And we start walking up the slope.

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.080
I guess we should stay behind the skeletons.

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.080
Yeah, definitely. Let the skeletons go in there first.

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:01.080
Oh, right.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.080
Tyler's worried about Christopher.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.080
Christopher, what was it?

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.080
Nothing, no. I was like, yeah, you're right. Let's stay behind them.

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.080
Okay, let's do it.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.080
So we march behind our formation of skeletons.

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.080
All right, the sun's blinding, as I said.

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:16.080
So you can kind of see the skeletons crest over the hill.

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:18.080
They're ahead of you, right?

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.080
Yes, correct.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.080
Yeah, they're ahead of you and you see them.

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.080
They go over the hill and they disappear.

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:26.080
So they're at the top of this place.

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:28.080
And from far off, from farther away

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:30.080
than if you were closer, for instance,

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.080
you hear a voice.

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.080
A voice.

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.080
A familiar and chilling.

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.080
I mean, not really chilling.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.080
Voice calls out.

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:45.080
You seek to lay siege to the Ziggurat, Mark II.

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:50.080
Well, let's see if you can take care of my welcome party.

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:53.080
Their hospitality is...

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:56.080
Dietic!

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.080
See, that's PCP.

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:00.080
Yeah.

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:03.080
Their hospitality is...

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:08.080
Shall we say, less than hospitable?

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.080
That's the more clever version.

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.080
Yeah, I did a flurry right on it.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.080
Wait, whose voice was that?

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.080
That's Emerald Darkstar, if...

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.080
Oh, shit, yeah.

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:22.080
If I know anything.

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:25.080
I didn't hear a thing that was said because I was so dazzled by that.

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:28.080
I love looking at Spencer's eyes while he does that voice.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:30.080
Did you see him vibrate?

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.080
They're just dead eyes.

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.080
No wonder he's so evil with a voice like that.

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.080
Yeah, he probably got teased a lot.

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:40.080
What was the upshot of what he said?

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.080
You dare to assail the Ziggurat, Mark II.

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.080
That's the upshot?

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:50.080
And here's a welcoming committee, but in air quotes.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.080
Okay.

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:56.080
Can we send Avenger up there and have him flip off?

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.080
People are like, let's go in there and let's do it.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.080
We're going to march the skeletons.

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.080
He knows we're coming, that's why he said that stuff.

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.080
Onward.

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:10.080
So as you crest the ill, you see all those demons that I was previously mentioning.

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:13.080
Let's see about those demons I was previously mentioning.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:19.080
Standing in front of the black keep, blocking the ice road towards it,

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.080
is a sizable demonic force.

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:27.080
You see about 30 of those sliming yellow oozy demons that I've mentioned in previous encounters.

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:31.080
As well as 10 tall skinny knights clad in black armor.

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:34.080
You also see two purple porco demons.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:37.080
Those are massive demonic porcupines.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:43.080
As well as a massive red demon standing head and shoulders above the tallest of the dark knights.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:47.080
They stand blocking the road, glaring at you as if daring you to challenge them.

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:50.080
However, we don't seize your skeleton army.

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.080
What?

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.080
Aw, great.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.080
They just, they de-camped? What happened?

01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:01.080
Well, that's what happens when you send a force to some place you can't see.

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:02.080
We were right behind them.

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.080
I mean, you were marching right behind them.

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.080
Yeah, now they're gone?

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.080
Yeah.

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:11.080
I, I, I, I call out, you, you, you.

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.080
Skeletons!

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:17.080
These skeletons aren't the most talkative, but yet you don't hear anything.

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.080
I mean, and so you don't hear anything.

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.080
Fuck you and your teeth?

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.080
Nothing?

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:23.080
No.

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.080
Wait, so they're just gone?

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:29.080
You don't see them. I mean, so they would appear gone.

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.080
Merage.

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.080
Alright, well, we can,

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.080
Oh, you see, it might be like some sort of mirage kind of thing.

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.080
Yeah, well, we keep marching forward.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.080
I mean, yeah.

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:40.080
You feel the ice. Give way below your feet.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.080
You plunge.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:44.080
Shit, downward.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:48.080
I bet there's some skeletons down there.

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:51.080
Do I get a balance check before I go tumbling to my death?

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.080
Nah, you more just kind of tumble.

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.080
Son of a bitch.

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.080
Yeah.

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:59.080
As you will.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:02.080
Just watch Princess Bride this weekend.

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.080
It's a great movie.

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:04.080
Yeah.

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:08.080
You fall down, down, down through the icy floor and down, down, down,

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:13.080
landing in a dark, icy, cold place on a crunchy pile of bones.

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:18.080
Man, Ted, Steve, Laquisha.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.080
Number nine.

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.080
You notice you're all separated.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.080
You don't see your friends.

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.080
So we're all alone?

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.080
You're all in separate rooms.

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.080
Quark.

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.080
Sharpey.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.080
All right.

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:37.080
Ah, Coco.

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.080
Christenburg.

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.080
Yeah.

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:40.080
Quark.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.080
Can we, Quark?

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.080
Can we see each other?

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.080
Just very, very faintly.

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:46.080
You can't see in the darkness, either.

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:48.080
So it's dark and there's bones around us?

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:49.080
Yeah.

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.080
Are these presumably our skeleton army?

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:52.080
Yeah.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.080
Oops.

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:58.080
I take a bone and I wrap a part of my pantaloon.

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:03.080
I rip part of my robe off real sexy-like.

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.080
Wrap it around a bone.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:09.080
Fuck it, I just light a torch.

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:12.080
I try to make a torch out of a bone for a while and then I just like,

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:16.080
you know what, they don't make them like they do at the store.

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.080
You're in a chamber.

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:21.080
It's a stone chamber except one of the walls is made of ice.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:24.080
There's a hole in the ceiling presumably where you fell through.

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:29.080
And then there's a big iron circular door before you.

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:32.080
That's all you see other than the skeletons.

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:34.080
Before all of us?

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:37.080
I mean, yeah, that's what you all see, I guess.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.080
I have low light vision so I can see that too.

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.080
I have goggles.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.080
Oh yeah, the goggles of night.

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.080
So all the skeletons are just dead?

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:48.080
No, I mean they're not.

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:49.080
Oh.

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:50.080
Skeletons.

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:52.080
Well, they're undead.

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:55.080
Is there any way to make them reassemble or is it just like, sorry?

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:58.080
That happens.

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:00.080
Hey, reassemble, skeletons.

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.080
That happens.

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.080
Woo!

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:06.080
I try to open my eyes.

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:08.080
I try to open my door.

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.080
Hey, Quark!

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.080
Yeah?

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.080
Tell your skeletons that they're cool to get back up.

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.080
Hey, everybody get up.

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.080
Oh, they all get up.

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.080
Okay.

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:26.080
I say to my skeletons, looks like you hated it.

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:32.080
I feel like I'd be like, why we got to fight like this if they said that?

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:37.080
Like if that happened, if I was quicker on the uptake and that happened to me with a waiter,

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.080
I'd be like, why you got to be like that?

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:40.080
I don't know.

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:41.080
There's no winning.

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.080
Yeah.

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:44.080
What if you just hit him?

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.080
That'd be winning.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:49.080
Because the day hit them, they had to wait on my table.

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.080
They're already bummed out.

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:54.080
It's a sad situation for everybody.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:58.080
What if you just stare at them and maintain unblinking eye contact?

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:03.080
I mean, these are all just things like, I'm not going to condition.

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.080
I'm saying like, they have to stop.

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:09.080
We can't come up with ways to make them miserable in response.

01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.080
It's not miserable.

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:12.080
Just make them go, maybe I shouldn't have said that.

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.080
Maybe I should think about saying that in the future.

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:18.080
Maybe I should become a better person in general.

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:21.080
If I can accomplish that with a stare, I've done something right.

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:24.080
Maybe if I care enough about it, I'll bring literature.

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.080
That's like how they can opt out of saying that.

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.080
Leave it on the table.

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:36.080
Just so you know, you don't have to do a bit when you see crumbs on the plate.

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:38.080
You feel like they're calling you fat when they say that?

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.080
No, no, honestly, not.

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:43.080
I just think it's like a tiny little example of how we just kind of had these habits that

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:47.080
were just kind of like, you know, just catch phrases and got milks, too much

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.080
information and things.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:53.080
But that's an example of one that kind of like, in that tiny little split second

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:56.080
moment, just like confusion and anxiety happen.

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.080
Never happiness, ever.

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:00.080
Yeah.

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.080
Yeah.

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:04.080
But sometimes also you're talking to somebody who kind of feels bad that they've

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:07.080
just mowed down a fucking bucket of chicken.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:10.080
You know, there's that, too, I guess.

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.080
There aren't even bowens left on the plate.

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:16.080
You must have hated it.

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:20.080
What restaurant are you going to where you eat a bucket of chicken?

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.080
What are you like?

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.080
This is like a Comic-Con panel.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.080
You're just going to catch me in a...

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:30.080
How's the kutcher?

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:31.080
All right.

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.080
So one of the doors, walls is made of ice, right?

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:34.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:36.080
You were opening a door, right?

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.080
Yeah, I tried to open the door.

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.080
Yeah.

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.080
So you open the iron door and it swings forth.

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:46.080
And inside you see a large gray skinned humanoid creature with blazing eyes and large

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:48.080
ram's horns.

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:54.080
He gives a mighty do-raw roar and then closes the door.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:59.080
Oh, you found the men's room.

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.080
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.080
Can I try opening my door?

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.080
Yeah.

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.080
Is it the same guy?

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.080
No.

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:14.080
This door opens into a larger icy chamber and flitting around said icy chamber is a

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:20.080
small blue imp flying around on bat wings as a whole.

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:21.080
Okay.

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:22.080
Yeah.

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:26.080
Behind him you can see a staircase going upwards.

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:27.080
Okay.

01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:28.080
I yell at the imp.

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.080
I'm like, hey!

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.080
Why are we?

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.080
What are you doing?

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.080
Stop that.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.080
Come here.

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.080
Talk to me.

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.080
What are you doing?

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.080
You guys can hear that faintly.

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.080
Okay.

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.080
It doesn't respond to you though.

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.080
Is that you, Christopher?

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:42.080
Yeah, there's this blue shithead flying around in this room.

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:43.080
I don't know what he's doing.

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:46.080
There's a big horn-faced guy outside my door.

01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:48.080
He looks like an asshole.

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.080
I'm just hanging out.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.080
This sucks, you guys!

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:53.080
Open your door and see what's out there, Malrain and Sharpie.

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.080
May I open my door?

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:56.080
You may.

01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:59.080
I would like to open the door.

01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:00.080
Okay.

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.080
You open the door and it swings open.

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:08.080
Inside you can see a horrendous assortment of rusted metal blades on rusted metal poles.

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:13.080
As the door opens, you hear a clacking as the metallic limbs begin to move and sputter.

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:18.080
And several of them fly out of the door, lunging at you.

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:21.080
May I use my...

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.080
Perfect step.

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:30.080
May I use my flaming armor to melt the metal?

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:36.080
Yeah, so these limbs kind of lunge out, but they miss you as you activate.

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:38.080
Did I miss something awesome?

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:44.080
Someone said, use your perfect skin to open the door.

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.080
That's pretty good.

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:55.080
Anyway, yeah, and then you activate your flaming armor and it starts to kind of melt these things a little bit.

01:28:55.080 --> 01:29:02.080
Not melt so much as make them red hot, but it's kind of inflicting some sort of, I mean, melting.

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:04.080
It's definitely increasing the temperature.

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.080
Let's say that.

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.080
You almost set damage.

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.080
Almost.

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:10.080
Oh, it's doing damage too.

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:12.080
But only eight.

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.080
Not bad for it doing nothing.

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:17.080
Well, I mean, it didn't do nothing. It did eight damage.

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.080
Sharpie, what's outside your door?

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.080
Did you see any of the stuff on the walls too?

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.080
The walls are made of ice.

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:26.080
Like, the other walls are made of stone except for these ice walls.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.080
Okay, I go up to my door.

01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:30.080
I'm just going to give it a little open.

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.080
You know what?

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:33.080
A big open.

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:38.080
It swings open and reveals several frozen, intact corpses.

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.080
They look like adventurers.

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:42.080
Their bodies are adorned in fine items and equipments.

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:44.080
Jackpot.

01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:46.080
And, of course, a tragedy.

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:56.080
What kind of fine items do I just procure them?

01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.080
Sure.

01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:03.080
You procure four cloaks of resistance, four rings of protection, two boots of wintry might,

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:06.080
and a patch of pigeon apache.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:09.080
Two boots of spry springing, one rod of frost.

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:11.080
Wait, I want that one. Dibs on that one instead.

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:15.080
One mighty greatsword, one whisper bow, and one assassin's ribbon-decker.

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:16.080
Well, I want that one. I want that one.

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:18.080
Ribbon-decker.

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:20.080
Is it rechargeable?

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:24.080
Guys, I found a bunch of shit!

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:27.080
Hey, I want dibs on some of that.

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:30.080
I got a big horn guy outside my door.

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:33.080
I don't care. I got a dagger. Fuck you.

01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:35.080
Wait, wow, wow.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:37.080
You don't have a dagger.

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.080
Are we connected?

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.080
Soon.

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:40.080
He has a mall. We have to get to him.

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:41.080
Yeah.

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:46.080
Are we connected? Are these ice walls the things that are keeping us from each other?

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.080
Who knows, man?

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:53.080
I take my flaming sword and I start slicing at the wall from the direction where I hear

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.080
my friend's voices coming from.

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.080
You see, Chris de Burgh.

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:57.080
Hey!

01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:59.080
I'm just kidding. I didn't really mean to fuck you.

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:00.080
I'm sorry.

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.080
I'm sorry.

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:02.080
How's your dagger?

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:03.080
I don't have it yet.

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:06.080
I keep slicing through the walls until we find...

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:07.080
Mulraine. Mulraine.

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:08.080
Hey!

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.080
Oh my god!

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:10.080
Oh my god!

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:11.080
Oh my god!

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.080
Oh my god!

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.080
Oh my god!

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:16.080
Totally fell!

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.080
Mulraine, you look great.

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:22.080
You look great. Perfect skin. Oh my god.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:23.080
I try.

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:24.080
Okay.

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:25.080
Oh, she's a dork.

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:32.080
I learned it from watching you. I learned it from watching you.

01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:34.080
I keep slicing until it gets to Sharpie.

01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:35.080
Sharpie!

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:36.080
Sharpie, oh my god!

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:37.080
Oh my god!

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:38.080
Oh, hey!

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:39.080
Hey!

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.080
Look at all that stuff.

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:48.080
Looks like you hate it.

01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:49.080
How about it, guys?

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.080
There's boots of shimmering, knives of plucking.

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:53.080
There are capes of resistance.

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:54.080
Capes of resistance?

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:56.080
Do they have any boots in my size?

01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:57.080
I'm a size nine.

01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:58.080
I think so.

01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.080
Okay, nice.

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.080
Whoa, they do.

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.080
Yay!

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:02.080
That's so convenient.

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.080
What are the things we can all share?

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:06.080
There's four of a few things, right?

01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:09.080
There's four cloaks of resistance and four rings of protection.

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:10.080
Three?

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:12.080
Resistance, resistance what?

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:14.080
I mean, stuff.

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:17.080
It gives you a bonus on your saving throws.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:18.080
Versus?

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.080
Fun rules.

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:21.080
And what were the weapons?

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:22.080
What?

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.080
Oh, weapons.

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:29.080
Mighty Greatsword, Whisperbow, Ribbon Dagger, and a Rot of Frost.

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.080
That sounds like one for each of us.

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:32.080
Oh, damn.

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:33.080
I'll do the Rot of Frost.

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.080
Weird.

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:37.080
Mulraine probably Whisperbow, right?

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.080
Probably.

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.080
Yeah, sure.

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.080
I have a question about this Ribbon Dagger.

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:45.080
Does it have a long ribbon attached to it in which maybe I could throw it and take it back?

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:47.080
Yeah, that's exactly it.

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:50.080
Oh, my God.

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:54.080
Scarecrow got a brain.

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:57.080
Christopher got a knife with a rope pre-tied to it.

01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:58.080
All right.

01:32:58.080 --> 01:32:59.080
It's amazing.

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.080
And what's the Rot of Frost?

01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:02.080
Is that mine?

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:04.080
I would believe that would be mine.

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:05.080
What do I get?

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.080
You get the sword.

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:07.080
Mighty Greatsword.

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:08.080
Oh, yeah.

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.080
Tell me about the Mighty Greatsword.

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.080
It's super mighty.

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:14.080
Hey, guys, I got a Mighty Sword.

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.080
That's adorable.

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:16.080
Thank you.

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:19.080
It's, like, bigger than the last one.

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:20.080
All right.

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:21.080
Take it.

01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:22.080
Pretty.

01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.080
How much larger is it than him now?

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:26.080
Like, let's see.

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:29.080
The last one was roughly 25% longer than him.

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:33.080
I would say this one's at least 35% longer than him.

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:38.080
I'd say if you're, like, 3 foot 3 inches, then this one would have to be, you know...

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.080
Do the math.

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:43.080
Four foot 2 inches.

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:44.080
All right.

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:48.080
There are ways people can bookmark this part of the podcast, so they can just

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:51.080
skip right to it.

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:54.080
I don't know if that technology exists, but...

01:33:54.080 --> 01:34:02.080
All right, if we have to invent it, could I suggest for a name, uh, highlightfinder?

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:05.080
Thrillseeker.

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:06.080
That's...

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:08.080
All right.

01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:10.080
And about my rod of.

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:11.080
of...

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.080
of...

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:18.720
sense that it cast cold spells, it would take like a day to study it, but once that

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:22.480
day's over, who boy?

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:27.560
And these cloaks of resistance can be donned without me having to choose to take off anything

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:28.560
else, right?

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:30.680
Like I just have my wizardly robes.

01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:38.040
You got, yeah, I mean, you have a cape, like your dad's cape, I think those kind are in

01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:39.600
the same place.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.960
Can you wear two capes?

01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:45.640
I mean, oh, my dad's cape is like it's like a teleportation cape.

01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:46.640
Oh, yeah.

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.600
It's just not charged or.

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:53.800
No, it recharges once per day and you used it, tried to use it twice per day and forgot

01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:54.800
about it.

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:59.120
What, you had a teleportation cape at that time?

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:01.280
In my defense, I finally remembered I had a bird.

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:04.080
How about you grab us all and teleport out of this hole?

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.160
Everybody go through your shit, like this, let's all take inventory real quick.

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:11.880
Wait, you had a teleportation cape this whole time?

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:12.880
Yes, Lizette.

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:18.040
Don't you also have a staff that grows so you can climb out on it?

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:19.040
Yeah.

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.040
Okay.

01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:22.720
Hey, Dan, you're holding out on us, man.

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:25.080
I mean, Sharpie.

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:28.560
Can I remind you guys that the reason you found all this shit is because I forgot I had all

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:29.560
that stuff.

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:33.920
What are you going to say next time?

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:39.880
If we hadn't gotten our asses kicked all five times before now, we wouldn't even be here.

01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:41.880
It's called the butterfly theory effect.

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:42.880
Look it up.

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:43.880
I don't know.

01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:44.880
I like the way you guys are looking at me.

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:45.880
Hey, that was an Ashton Kutcher movie.

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:46.880
Yeah, Ashton Kutcher reference.

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.880
There you go.

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:48.880
All right.

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:56.440
I want to take that climbing rod that I have that should we get out of here over to beneath

01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:58.000
the hole that I fell through?

01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Yeah.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Wait, but that doesn't leave our skeleton behind.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
There's a staircase behind the blue.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.320
Should we check this out before we go?

01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:04.320
We need our skeletons anyway.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.320
We can't.

01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.320
We have them.

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:07.320
Okay.

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.320
We told them to get up.

01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:09.320
We rally our skeletons.

01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:12.320
We walk through Chris de Burgh's door towards the blue staircase.

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:13.320
Yeah.

01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:14.320
It's like the least threatening.

01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.320
Yeah.

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.320
Yeah.

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.320
What happens?

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:19.840
Oh, that's me.

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:23.600
I walk into the room with the blue, but I say, hey, shithead, I brought my friends.

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:24.600
Come on.

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:25.600
Yeah.

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:29.680
So he's still flitting around on those bat wings, still on the other side of the chamber

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:30.680
is that staircase.

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:31.680
As I mentioned.

01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:32.680
God damn it.

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:35.320
He's spinning around like a top and midair.

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:41.240
It causes a rapid wind to whip up and it starts blowing around the room.

01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:45.760
Soon chunks of ice and snow are beginning to be lifted up off the floor and the walls.

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:49.280
They're pulling off the walls and they're flying towards the demon and casing them in

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:54.280
ice and snow that keeps building up and building up until it looks like a giant snowflake

01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:57.440
floating around the air.

01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:58.840
We should kill that thing.

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:01.400
You said it was putting it.

01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:02.400
I'm sorry.

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.400
Yeah.

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:04.400
You referenced the demon.

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.400
Yeah.

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:06.680
So there's this blue imp demon.

01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:07.680
Oh, okay.

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:08.680
It's a thing.

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:09.680
Okay.

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:10.680
I see.

01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:11.680
So he's sucking in elements and turning into this other thing.

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:12.680
Now he's a snowflake.

01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:13.680
Yeah.

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:14.680
Now he's a giant snowflake.

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:15.680
Hold on.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.680
Like non-conflict resolution for a moment.

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:18.680
Okay.

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:19.680
Okay.

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:20.680
I tried.

01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:21.680
He didn't listen to me.

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:22.680
No, no, no.

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:23.680
We all know.

01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:24.680
I saw the subreddit.

01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:25.680
Everyone jacking you off.

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.680
You're the best D&D player in the world.

01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:27.680
You did very well.

01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:28.680
Sorry.

01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:29.680
I try to do more terrible.

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:32.480
Am I trying to show you up there?

01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:33.800
I'm expressing my jealousy.

01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:34.800
I'm just saying.

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:35.800
I love you.

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:47.240
I kneel in front of the snowflake and I say in three different languages, hello.

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:52.440
That's how you do it, Tyler.

01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:53.440
Wait.

01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:54.640
Does one of us have, one of us, amelot of frost.

01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:55.640
That's one of us.

01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:56.640
Me.

01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:57.640
You.

01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:58.640
Maybe you can like stop it.

01:37:58.640 --> 01:37:59.640
You can control the ice.

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:01.640
Can you stop this terrible thing from happening?

01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:04.280
I can calm and intensify hail, sleet and snow.

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:07.080
You can calm this piece of thing before it kills us.

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:08.640
Let's see what happens with his hello.

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:10.320
We'll go first.

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:15.640
You see a central spot in the middle of the snowflake, kind of glue blue.

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:16.640
Yeah.

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:17.640
Yeah.

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:21.120
That means hello back.

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:22.120
Who knows, man?

01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:23.120
You don't speak so much.

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:29.280
Amelot of winter to calm this thing.

01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.960
It's flown in the air.

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:34.760
You use your amulet and it continues to float in the air.

01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:39.880
I say to it, I don't know if you can communicate with us, but I'm making the assumption that

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:46.080
you, like us, are prisoners in this dungeon, that you ran afoul of Admiral Darkstar and

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:50.720
that you might be able to help us defeat him.

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:56.520
It's the central spot and it's a, you know, center of mass kind of turns red and it starts

01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.400
spinning around like a saw blade.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:04.720
All right, I guess, let's kill it.

01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:05.720
Yeah.

01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:06.720
Krista Burke.

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:07.720
Yeah, let's kill it.

01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:09.240
Use that ribbon thing you got.

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:10.240
Oh yeah.

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:15.240
I want to, can I throw my dagger at it with the ribbon on it?

01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:16.240
I want to use the ribbon dagger.

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:17.240
Okay.

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:18.240
Just, yeah.

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:20.200
Use that ribbon dagger.

01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:22.240
You've never used one of these before.

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.240
Okay.

01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:28.800
So you're not, you're not the, the most experienced, shittier versions of that before.

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:29.800
Yeah.

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:30.800
I'm all over it.

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:31.800
It's fun.

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:32.800
They got different weights.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.320
That's how this stuff works.

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.920
Anyway, it does hit him.

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:37.920
For anyone wondering.

01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:40.920
Can I pull it back?

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.560
Yeah, yeah, that happens.

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:43.800
I want to do that.

01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:45.800
You deal one damage.

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:46.800
Yeah.

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.800
Suck it, nerd.

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:53.720
Mighty far sword attack.

01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:56.200
I think you have your far sword for the day used up.

01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:57.200
Oh shit.

01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.200
Yeah.

01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:59.200
Yeah.

01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:04.520
Let's just, I take out my, is it floating in the air above me?

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:05.520
Yeah.

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.520
You might be able to jump up there, but it'll be a bit of an exertion.

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:08.520
You want a boost?

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:09.520
Yeah.

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:14.720
I get on top of Krista Burke's shoulders and we run like a chicken fight.

01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:21.640
I go in there wielding my new sword and say, take a piece of this, snowflake.

01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:28.520
I heard you're not the same as all of your counterparts, but the pain I inflict will

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:29.520
be identical.

01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:33.520
I give a thumbs up to Sharpie.

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:34.520
I'm workshopping it.

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:35.520
I'm workshopping it.

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:40.360
By the time I get there, have the joke punched up.

01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:47.360
I throw my, my snowflake related quips to a room, a writer's room.

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:53.000
Your clips get workshopped as you're given this thumbs up that kind of throws off your

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.600
chicken stack of adventurers balance and you just kind of topple to the ground.

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:01.640
It's hard to balance and thumbs up and stab people.

01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:02.640
Okay.

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:03.640
I run back and regroup.

01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:04.640
Yeah.

01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:05.640
Oh shit.

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:06.640
Okay.

01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:07.640
May I do something?

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.640
Yep.

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:09.640
Yeah.

01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:10.640
You want to throw arrows at the snowflake?

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:11.640
Yeah.

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:12.640
You don't want to throw arrows.

01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:13.640
That's a bad idea.

01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:14.640
Use your bow.

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:15.640
Use your new bow.

01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:16.640
Wait.

01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:17.640
Wait.

01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:18.640
You don't know what it is yet.

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:19.640
Whisper bow.

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:20.640
Yeah.

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:21.640
Yeah.

01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:22.640
You should try your new bow.

01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:23.640
Why are we whispering?

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:24.640
I don't want to talk about it.

01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:25.640
I can't hear what's happening.

01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:33.520
May I use my whisper bow to throw three fire arrows at the snowflake?

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.640
Your whisper bow can only fire two arrows.

01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:36.640
That's fine.

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:37.640
I'm not, I'm not picky.

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:38.640
You want to make them flaming arrows?

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:39.640
Yes, please.

01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:40.640
Yes.

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:50.640
One of your arrows strikes, hitting its mark, mark being the snowflake in this instance.

01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:54.640
It deals seven damage.

01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:55.640
Nice.

01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:56.640
All right.

01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:57.640
Yeah.

01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:00.640
You see some of the ice kind of melt and drip off onto the floor.

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:05.640
That's what fire does to ice.

01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:06.640
Sharpie.

01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:07.640
Scorching ray.

01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:15.640
It strikes directly in its center of mass in that glowing red eyeball part I was mentioning.

01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:16.640
Sweet.

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:19.640
And it deals 13 damage.

01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:20.640
Yes.

01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:21.640
All right.

01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:27.920
It continues its rapid spinning and it kind of spins around the whole room, attempting

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:31.640
to slice into your torso slash midsections.

01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:36.640
I mean, what did you expect?

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.640
Not that.

01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:41.640
I tried to make friends with it.

01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:43.640
I don't even know.

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:48.640
So Mulraine and Christopher each get struck.

01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:49.640
No.

01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:55.640
And they each take, well, Christopher takes 12 damage.

01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:57.640
And Mulraine takes six.

01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:58.640
Oh, fuck.

01:42:58.640 --> 01:42:59.640
Dirty eyes.

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:00.640
This isn't, it's fine.

01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:01.640
It's fine.

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:02.640
You're all cut up.

01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:03.640
That's your fault.

01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:04.640
Yeah.

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:05.640
I've got to, I've listened.

01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:06.640
Try the ribbon dagger again.

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.640
You're getting good at it.

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:09.640
It did one damage.

01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:10.640
This doesn't seem like.

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:11.640
You're getting good at it.

01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:12.640
It's like a slap machine.

01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:13.640
It's going to pay off now.

01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:16.640
You got it warmed up.

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:17.640
This is the worst idea.

01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:18.640
Yeah.

01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:19.640
Let's just do the ribbon dagger again.

01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:20.640
Why not?

01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:21.640
What could go wrong?

01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:22.640
Critical hit.

01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:23.640
Fine.

01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:29.640
Whatever, you guys, whatever.

01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:31.640
Dealing four damage.

01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:32.640
Yeah.

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:38.640
We use the term critical loosely here.

01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:40.640
Is that me?

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:42.640
I put it at you.

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:43.640
Okay.

01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:44.640
I get back on Christopher shoulders.

01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:45.640
I go, let's try this again.

01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:46.640
One more time.

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:47.640
All right.

01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:48.640
What's my line?

01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.640
I need a snowflake line.

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:50.640
Oh, shit.

01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:51.640
Chill out.

01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:52.640
Chill out.

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:53.640
Okay.

01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:54.640
I get on.

01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:55.640
Thank you.

01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:58.640
I get on Christopher shoulders and I take out my flaming sword and I kind of spur him

01:43:58.640 --> 01:43:59.640
like he's a horse.

01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:00.640
Don't fuck.

01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:01.640
Why?

01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:02.640
What are you doing?

01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:04.640
It's lightly, you know.

01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:05.640
Shit.

01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:06.640
I'm running.

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:07.640
Sorry.

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:10.640
We start running at him and I say, chill out.

01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:12.640
An attack with my flaming sword.

01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:17.640
Your attack hits, or, I don't know.

01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:19.640
I'll leave.

01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:20.640
Wow.

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:21.640
Yeah.

01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:26.640
Your attack lands a lot better than your bad pun.

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:30.640
Or your delivery.

01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:33.640
Or my execution of that attempt of joked.

01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:35.640
Or that execution.

01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:37.640
Dealing 14 damage.

01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:38.640
14.

01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:39.640
Yeah.

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:40.640
Yeah.

01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:47.640
You see a chunk of ice kind of fall off of his body and I get snowflake into the ground.

01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.640
Hmm.

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:49.640
Yeah.

01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:50.640
So this is if it's made of ice.

01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:51.640
How much of it is left?

01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:52.640
Most of it.

01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:53.640
Shit.

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:59.640
I say, as I keep writing on Christopher and as I look back with my sword in the air, I

01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:04.640
welcome to melt down.

01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:08.640
I throw him onto the ground.

01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.640
I like that one.

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:13.640
Putting it at Mulraine's turn.

01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:15.640
Can I try to talk to this snowflake?

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:16.640
Yeah.

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:19.640
We've already determined that communication has failed.

01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:21.640
At least Dan, Dan trying to talk to his fail.

01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:22.640
I don't know.

01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:23.640
Yeah, that's a really weird.

01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:25.640
Can I try speaking it in elf?

01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:26.640
Yeah.

01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:27.640
Maybe it's an elvish snowflake.

01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:28.640
Yeah, go for it.

01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:29.640
Say an elf.

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:30.640
Can you tell it?

01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:31.640
Can you tell?

01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:32.640
Can you tell?

01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:33.640
What?

01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:36.640
Can you please tell the snowflake?

01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:37.640
I think it's very pretty.

01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:42.640
As you begin speaking in elven, the snowflake doesn't respond.

01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:45.640
The whisper bow, however, does and you can see there's runes on its surface.

01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:46.640
You couldn't notice before.

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:52.640
They're beginning to glow and light up as you respond to your elven speech.

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:54.640
In your face, Christopher.

01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:55.640
Whatever.

01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:58.640
The snowflake is an elvish.

01:45:58.640 --> 01:45:59.640
That was my...

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:03.640
There's kind of a new will they won't they kind of element going on here.

01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:04.640
Yeah.

01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:07.640
It's kind of a weird salmon, Diane, sexual attention here.

01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:11.640
I think the gay people in the audience want to know in this relationship who would be...

01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:14.640
Who would plan the wedding?

01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:16.640
He certainly dresses better than I do.

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:17.640
I don't know.

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:23.640
It's touching to barrel that call back.

01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:25.640
It's still your turn though.

01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:29.640
You're just talking an elvish so that doesn't take up a turn.

01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:34.640
Whisper to your bow and elven and make its arrows fly true.

01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:37.640
May I use one more arrow to...

01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:38.640
You can shoot too.

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:39.640
It's a new turn.

01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:40.640
Oh, great.

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:43.640
Two new arrow flaming arrows on my whisper bow, please.

01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:44.640
Yeah.

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.640
You fired the flaming arrows from your whisper bow.

01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:54.640
Both of them strike their mark, plunging deep into the snowflake.

01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:56.640
We're fighting a snowflake.

01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:58.640
Yeah, you are.

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:08.640
Dealing 33 damage.

01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:14.640
You should talk to your bow more.

01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:18.640
Clearly, that was what did it, talking to your bow.

01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:19.640
Yeah, you're right.

01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:20.640
I got this.

01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:25.640
They strike into the snowflake and it bursts into flame and kind of melts and you see a

01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:28.640
charred imp kind of plop to the floor.

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:29.640
Yeah.

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:33.640
Then your bow kind of fades in color, like goes back to normal.

01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:39.640
I walk up to the imp and I say, I used to fuck you.

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:42.640
I used to fuck you?

01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:45.640
Yeah, I didn't want to say I used to see you because we already saw him.

01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:46.640
I used to meet you.

01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:47.640
I used to beat you.

01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:48.640
I used to beat you.

01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:49.640
I used to beat you.

01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:50.640
I used to beat you.

01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.640
I used to beat you.

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.640
Thank you for coming to Harmontown.

01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:56.640
I used to beat you.

01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:58.640
I used to beat all of you.

01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:01.640
One more time for Tyler and Lisette, everybody.

01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:02.640
Thank you, Tyler.

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:03.640
Thank you, Lisette.

01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:08.640
Spencer Crittenden.

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:10.640
Thank you, sir.

01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:11.640
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:14.640
One more time for your mayor, Dan Harmon.

01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:17.640
Shout out to Spencer's mom who's also here.

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:19.640
Spencer's mom is here.

01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:24.640
Spencer's mom's here.

01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:26.640
Yeah, I love Spencer's mom.

01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:28.640
Thank you all.

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:29.640
We love you.

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:41.640
Good night.
