00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Happy New Year!

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
I missed you all so much.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
It feels like a long time.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
It feels like almost last year.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
From Hollywood, California.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
In the year Enterdomini 2017, Harmontown is now in session.

00:30.000 --> 00:59.000
Music plays

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown.

01:03.000 --> 01:11.000
Music plays

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Happy New Year.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Hello Jane.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Well, how about that Meryl Streep, huh?

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
She won something.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
She made a speech.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
She made a nice, long speech that was nice.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
She kind of, she kind of, you know, kind of,

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
she was very, very specifically chided Trump,

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
specifically for his mocking of the disabled reporter,

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
which really was the kind of the, I don't know,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I don't want a bunch of women to go like,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
wait, what about the Grab on the Pussy thing?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
It's not a competition.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
But she was like, you know, she's Meryl Streep,

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
so she's like, she said it broke her heart,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
and it's like, you know, at this point,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
even if it was a fake election,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
or even if it wasn't, like, like, like,

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
he kind of lost at this point.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
He kind of, like, like, you'd rather, you know,

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
if he lost the election, Meryl Streep might like him one day,

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
you know, like, but he won, and now he's just damned forever.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
I would rather not be president and have Meryl Streep like me,

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
is what I'm trying to say.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah, but he doesn't care.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
He just wants people to say his name out loud.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
He loves it.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah, thanks, that's a good counterpoint.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
It's true, he does like attention, doesn't he?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
All right, well, you know what,

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
there's a bad thing that Meryl Streep talked about.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
What was the award she won? What was the event?

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
The Golden Globe. It's about time she got one.

02:54.000 --> 03:01.000
And Donald Glover just found out,

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
because I was scooching through all these things,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I don't know, Golden Globes, I never care about them,

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
but Donald Glover's show Atlanta won Best Show,

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
as far as the best comedy slash music show,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
and he won Best Actor.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
So congratulations.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
I really, really got to check out that show.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
I have a lot of catching up to do on my friend's shows.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
At a scale of 0 to 100 percent,

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
which is what 100 means,

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
how much, I mean, be honest,

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
do you feel responsible for Donald Glover's success?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Two percent.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Because there's absolutely no way he,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
if he hadn't been cast on community,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
he wouldn't have been cast on something else.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
The video was a result of him sharing a manager with the Russo Brothers.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Joe Russo was like, look, hot tip,

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
forget filling this role of this like,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Podunk football player guy,

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
just put a star in your show before he becomes globally famous,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
and he was absolutely right.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
All of these community actors have gone on to amazing things,

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
and a ton of that credit goes to the Russo Brothers

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
for their wisdom in the casting process.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
They said, do Alison Bray for sure,

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
and stuff like that,

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
like a lot of credit to them.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
And Donald for sure, it wouldn't have mattered.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
If you hadn't been cast on community,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
it would have been anything else.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
And then that would have been the place

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
where everybody first saw that he was a genius,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
and then he would have gone and done Atlanta or whatever.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
I mean, the guy is like, he's just going to eat the moon next.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Eat it, and everyone's going to go,

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I can't believe someone ate the moon.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
It was like, well, did you meet Donald Glover?

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Where is Harmontown going to go for our colony

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
if he eats the moon?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
We can live on Donald Glover's head.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
We have to kill Donald Glover.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Let's not make assumptions.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
That's breaking rules.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
You just said he's going to eat our colony as a home base.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
But I broke the third of the four agreements when I said that.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I made an assumption.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I think that's the one.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Is there an assumption about not living on someone's head?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
No, I made an assumption.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
What?

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
You proposed that we could live on his head, and that seems...

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
I'm not judging. You're so drunk.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I'm not drunk at all.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
You're not drunk. All right.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Well, good that I'm really not judging.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I'm just concerned about you now.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
You're drunk.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
My voice is scratchy, so I'm going to kind of come in and out vocally.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Oh, okay. All right.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Well, I, uh...

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
I, uh...

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I have a scratchy voice, too,

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
so it's going to take me a second to pull up my notes.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I thought you were going to say,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
I apologize, but that was never going to happen.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Well, what did I... I'm sorry.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
I'm sorry I accused you of being drunk.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Is that what I did wrong?

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
That's for starters.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
I was dismissive of you as a person.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Yes.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Which is bad.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Agreed.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Makes you feel bad, and, uh, I...

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
And it also breaks one of my four agreements,

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
which is I was not impeccable with my word.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I used my word to...

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Did you create black magic instead of white magic?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Which seems racist.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
A racist distinction, but maybe the...

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Maybe the fifth agreement is be racist, and the guy just left that out of the book

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
because he knew it's some more copies. I don't know.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
He talks a lot about black magic and white magic.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
I'm like, careful.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
But at any rate, uh...

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I cast some black magic on you.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Bad magic.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Sorry. It won't happen again.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Well, I can't... I can't make assumptions.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I will try to make it stop happening.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
I'm working on it. I'm in therapy.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Let's see, Meryl Streep.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Are you drunk?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
No, no.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Not yet. I mean, I'm gonna get drunk up here.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Uh, all right. Well, so, I mean, just, you know, politics corner.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Like...

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
So, Spencer...

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Hey, guys.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Whoa, you're drunk.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
No, man.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
No.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
Isn't it perfectly feasible to accept election results

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
and also want the winner investigated for treason?

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Like, can't you just... Why is it every time?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
It's like, this is a big deal.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Like, it's... The intelligence community say,

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
okay, yeah, there was an order to interfere.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
There was all these things.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
Now, the only thing left to do is to ask who knew what and when.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
If there was collusion, it really doesn't matter.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Yeah, if, for instance, Roger Stone was tweeting evidence of collusion

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
with Julian Assange before the WikiLeaks leaks dropped,

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
that would be very highly interesting for, you know, maybe people to know.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
Like, if he, for instance, tweeted three separate times,

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
you know, like, weird things that alluded to the fact that Julian Assange

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
is looking to leak helpful stuff to his campaign

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
and that they were gonna win the election for it,

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
that might be really, you might be able to build a case off of something like that.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
I need, I need something that's more just,

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
I would like to maybe take up just a peek at the tax forms.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Yeah, no, I'm just saying, just as a starting point on public record where,

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
I mean, that's just, you know, that should, that alone should be like,

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
yeah, let's investigate this whole fucking thing.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah, because didn't we put people to death because they told some people

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
about some stuff with the atomic bomb?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I mean, we take treason very seriously still in this case.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
It's treason, we call it treason.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Yeah, it's a bad word.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
And it says, it doesn't, but if you say anything like,

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
well, this seems bad, we should look into this.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
What you get back is, yeah, but emails.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
And I'm like, okay, but that election's over, kid,

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
or are you a Russian troll bot now?

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
But like, okay, so that election is over,

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
we just need to now know, preferably before the inauguration,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
does he belong in prison?

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Like, congratulations, you won.

09:23.000 --> 09:29.000
Now, I need to see all of your tax information from your 1987

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
when you were going over to Russia to talk about building hotels

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
all the way through you, you know, marrying your Czechoslovakian wife.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Yeah, I mean, it's common knowledge.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
He can't borrow from American banks.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
He is tied up in Russian financial assets.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
And that's just, we know that, we can't prove it,

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
but everyone knows that, and it's like that might very well lead

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
exactly, it might say like Putin, like personal check,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
it might say that.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
There might be, isn't this all the government?

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
I mean, what can't you just now at this point,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
if all of the intelligence agencies say, yeah, this is a thing,

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
can't you now just even, you don't even have to subpoena,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
can't you just walk across the hall to the IRS

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
and take something from one cabinet and put it in another cabinet?

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
Yeah, you would think, you certainly would think.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Also, in a world where you can hack everything,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
somebody hack this motherfucker?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Hack him up?

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
Like, how do we get our best people or our worst people on the job

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
and hack his tax returns?

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
Most people believe that that probably has happened long ago,

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
either at the same time as the, I mean, because what better,

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
all the better, I mean, that's just pure speculation at this point,

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
but it also just makes perfect sense from a game theory perspective

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
to just like go, okay, now we have all the, you know,

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
all of the information on them as well,

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
and now you just have a president, like, it's a crazy sci-fi novel.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
But I don't want to go that far because it's like,

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
it gets tangled up in this thing where people think that you're trying to say

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
he's not allowed to be president, no fairies do overzees.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
I'm not saying that, I just want to know if my new president belongs in prison yet.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
I'm a firm believer in the, I think it's the 13th amendment,

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
which is no cuts, no butts, no coconuts.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
And it's insane that 20 amendments later, women were, we got the coconuts.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah, why was that?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
It took us so fucking long, it was crazy.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
We're so backwards as a people.

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
That's like, all right, so, yeah, so I almost drowned in Fiji,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
but Cody saved me.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Wait, I didn't hear it by this.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
I was with you for a week in New York, I didn't know that you almost died.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Well, it wasn't like, I mean, it was to be expected,

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
like, when you look at me and imagine me walking into the ocean,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
like, what do you think is going to happen?

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
So I didn't think it was like big news, I was like,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
it would be like if I went on a roller coaster and I was like,

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
I got pretty sick and I wouldn't like even tweet that, I'd be like...

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
But not to be diminishing, you seem buoyant.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
Which is what Cody is assuring me.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
She's like, you'll float, you'll float.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
And I'm like, no did, but I'm dying.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
Like, I swear it was just like muscle to like weight or something.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I don't know, it's like, I just kept, she's like a little bean

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
and she fucking like zips.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
We were not snorkeling and she's like,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
like a UFO.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
And when she was a little speck, I was like, Cody, Cody, too far.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
Then I came out a little bit more and I was like,

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
flippers aren't touching the sand, that's my deal breaker in snorkeling.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
I need flippers, flipper tips to touch sand.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
I'm not a pussy.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
I'm not saying I need to be able to stand up and have my head above our,

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
I just need to be able to graze the sand with my flipper tips.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
And when that stopped being a...

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Flipper tips go whoo-woop.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
That's only in the mountain.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
You're supposed to be making breakfast.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
You're supposed to be making breakfast.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
That's like an alarm clock.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
It's just for decoration, man.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
That's all.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
That's all, man.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
All right, we're dating ourselves.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
We are?

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
How romantic.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
Next thing we'll be talking about techno viking.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
These kids...

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
Their first memory is the OK Go video.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
It was playing in the maternity word lobby.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
So anyway, yeah.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
So I was...

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
I was floating and I saw her little head.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I'm like, well, if my flippers can't touch sand,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
she's in shark world.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
You should come back and she's like, zip, OK.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
And then she went away.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
And I was like, all right, that's good.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
And by doing this for like 20 minutes,

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
look at the sand underneath.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
It's so great to have a snorkel as I can breathe.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
And then I just look up and I'm like in the same spot.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
And she's just...

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
And then I was like, Kodak!

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
After a while.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I said, I'm starting to panic.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I said, don't panic.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
I am already.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I waited until I started to say something.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
And she's like...

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
And I was like...

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
And then I just started...

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
At a certain point she comes over and she's like, just paddle.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
And I'm like, I've been paddling and I'm yelling at her.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
I'm like, this is how people die.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
This is how they die.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
And she says...

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
I got to a point, I swear, where I said go on without me.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
And here's why.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Because I was that convinced I was actually dying.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
Believe me, if I thought I had a chance at survival,

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
I would have risked killing her trying to live.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I'm not a hero.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
I just was so certain she couldn't save me.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
I didn't want to die and also have her blood on my hands.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
So I was like, just go.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I don't want to die an extra guilty death.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I just want to feel bad about everything I've eaten.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
And while I slowly sink to the bottom,

15:17.000 --> 15:23.000
the four foot, four foot ocean floor.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
One flipper length away from the bottom.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
Oh, by the way, a crab crawled on my fucking body.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
Before I got out there, that should have been an omen.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
I shouldn't have gone out there.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
There's sticks and shit.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
It's all beautiful. It's crystal blue ocean.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
And you can see the ground through it.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
And it'll be like a diaper.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
And I won't assume it's like negative parents.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
I'm assuming it's like an adventurous kid or something.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
But like sticks and moss.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
So you try to steer clear of the debris

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
and then some shit hits you.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
And then there was like a thing.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
It was like a little tickle thing.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
And I was like, yeah, what is that?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
And then I turn around.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I'm like, what the hell was that tickle?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
There was a fucking crab going, what are you doing?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
And I was like, ah, ah.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
But you're moving in water and you can't.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I'm like the Titanic and he's like a little DiCaprio.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Like he's just moving.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I didn't see the movie,

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
the physics involved in it was part of the plot.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
It's like moving towards me.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
So I'm trying to do like the dune blade thing

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
where it's like I move slow so that I can get out.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
But the crab is faster.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
And he wants to be on me and I don't know why.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
And then he crawled back on me again.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
So I take out my snorkel, my breathing apparatus.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I'm like, okay, got that.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
And then I hear this laughing.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
And it's these four Fijian kids

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
who are like 20 feet away and they're just laughing and pointing

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
and it actually made me feel better.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
Because the Fijian people are very, very nice

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
and children of course, as we all know, are wonderful.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
But they weren't like, I don't think they were like,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
they weren't like, ha, ha, he's going to die.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
So I was like, they were like, ha, ha, that must be a crab.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Like they could tell from my movements.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
It was like, look at his first crab or something.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
And I was like, oh, if that's a bit here, then I'm safe.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
They look like fucking cartoon crabs.

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
It looks like a goddamn deep fried soft shell crab,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
but it's alive.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Wait.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Try to paint the picture for me.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
It's crab shaped?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Yeah, yeah.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Okay.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
So then I get out there and I'm like, die.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
And then Cody's like trying to haul me.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
And I'm like, you're just going to kill yourself.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Just get out of here.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
And she's like, Dan, just grab Otto's.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
But you thought you were going to take her down with you?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Yeah, yeah.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
That's why I said, go on without me.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Because that's what they teach you in swim class.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I took a swim class.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
I mean, in gym, they said like, don't, if somebody's drowning,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
you know, you got to know how to save people a certain way

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
if you're a lifeguard because people just,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
drowning people will just kill you.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
They're just weapons in the water.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
They don't even know they'll kill you as soon as they look at you

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
because they're drowning.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
They've been given, they're like a 28 days later person.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
They don't even know who you are.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
They're just trying to stay above water.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
And if you go out to them, they'll try to climb on top of you.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
And then they'll like, I need four more people so I can stand.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
And then they'll be like, Josh, oh, they'll feel terrible.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
But it'll be too late for Josh.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
Don't be a Josh is what they said was the poster in the lifeguard,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
lifeguard class that I took.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
So I said, go on without me.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
But then what I did is she did like a little frog stroke thing.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
And I just, I just grabbed her a little butt.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
And she just slowly towed me into shore.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
And I was like, well, if I, yeah, I just died,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
just squeezing this little tushy.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
It was nice. It was nice.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
She was right.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
It wasn't really anywhere near death ever.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
But it's the thought that counts.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I think with near death experiences,

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
if you think that you're dying, then that's because it's,

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
that doesn't count with murder.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
But with death near death experience, the thought does count.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
The thought doesn't count with murder.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Attempted murder, the thought counts.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
In the eyes of the law.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Right.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
So anyways.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I'm glad you're alive.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
That would have been a trouble way to die.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Yeah.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Yeah.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
I saw this, I saw this like forensic files or something where a guy like,

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
a guy like took three women out on a boat and he had his way with them.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Yeah, I saw that one.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
You saw that one?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Yeah, I've seen them all.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
And then, and then, and then just cinder blocks.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Yeah.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Fuck it.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
That's, that's the worst way to die.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Right.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Like being alive and being thrown overboard with a thing, you know.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Yeah, that's fucked up.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
That's gotta be the worst way to die.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
And also, what, you're shaking your head?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
No, no, no, no.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Steve Levy has, has better way.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
Steve, Steve, just going like this.

20:09.000 --> 20:15.000
He's like, no, no, anti-aircraft round shot from the 300 meters through your gallbladder.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
You'll, you'll die over three days.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Like he has some dark thought in him.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
The thing about, if I, if I'm remembering that forensic files well enough, it was,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
they didn't all go over at once.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Like one girl watched them all go over.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Like she knew she was next.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Well, yeah.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
It's not just, oh, I'm not, and I, and I will pass out in 30 seconds.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
She watched the whole thing go and that's fucked up.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Yeah.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
She's like, she's like, he's not going to do that and then bring me into shore.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
And like, so tell me about yourself.

20:45.000 --> 20:52.000
Like one, one Peron, like in Argentina, like during, during his reign, when they had dissidents

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
there, the way that they got rid of people, they would fly a plane up and everyone that

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
was on the ground saw the plane.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
They know what was happening.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
They'd fly him over the river and they would just toss you out of the plane.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
But they didn't just fly you up and toss you out.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
They flew you around for a while and they blindfolded you and the plane was full of just piss and

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
shit because everybody's emptying their bowels because they know what's going to happen.

21:14.000 --> 21:22.000
Perhaps he's wondering why you'd shoot a man before throwing him out of a plane.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
That's a little bane.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Batman 3.

21:29.000 --> 21:35.000
A little movie called Batman 3 that's from, I mean, Littlefinger fucking got it in that

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
plane, right?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Or wait, was that Littlefinger?

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah, that was Littlefinger.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Yeah.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Yeah.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Yeah.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
What a show.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
What a new year.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
What a show.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
So, all right, so here's my last Fiji thing I'll share.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
Everybody's, oh, you're running into all your friends and they've all been somewhere and

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
they've got to tell you a bunch of shit you don't care about.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
I'm not accepted.

21:57.000 --> 22:04.000
I am no exception.

22:04.000 --> 22:12.000
My lack of exceptionality will make me unaccepted when I tell you my last Fiji story.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
So, everybody, when you land, everybody goes, you've got to try kava.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
You've got to do this kava stuff.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
And so, I asked at the resort, I had no plans on stepping off at the resort, but I also

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
was curious, is this a place where you can step off at the resort?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
I'm not a worldly man.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
I'm not a geopolitical expert.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
I dropped out of college.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
I don't know.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.280
So, I asked the driver all the way from the airport because the airport was either under

22:35.280 --> 22:39.000
a lot of construction or maybe it's a third world country.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
And I was safer to assume the latter.

22:43.000 --> 22:51.000
I didn't see any part in our dust signs and I didn't see any portraits of anybody that

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
looked democratically elected.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
So, I asked a few questions on the ride to the resort.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
So, how does the government work here?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
It was like, oh, it's a democracy.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
I'm like, all right.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
What do you have?

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
A president?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Is there a president and a prime minister?

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
So, how often do you have elections?

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Four or five years?

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
Why does it change sometimes?

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Well, we're in a little bit of a transition.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Okay.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
All right.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Okay.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
That's all I needed to hear.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
But then I heard some more.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
They're in the military and their buddy's the prime minister and the president.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
They run things and they run a tight ship over there.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
So, I'm like, that doesn't really tell me.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I was like, well, are tourists safe?

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Like, are you driving through these neighborhoods?

23:38.000 --> 23:45.000
Like, it's definitely poverty, but you're not seeing like crime poverty.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
It's not like broken windows.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
It's just like poverty.

23:49.000 --> 23:57.000
So, which is a thing that my western brain is kind of like not, the big part of the story

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
is that I'm not really able to compute that yet.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
Like, if I see certain physical characteristics of a building or a vehicle or something like that,

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
I'm immediately feeling like I'm in danger and this is a pretty broke place if you're

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
not on a resort.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
And so, I was like, yeah, I would probably just stay on the resort the whole time.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
So, I go up to the bartender at the resort and go, so what's the deal with the Kava thing?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
What's the Kava situation?

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Oh.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
They do this thing.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I'm like, okay, it's like a gimmick here.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I think that's like Kava.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
And then he's like, he says to the guy, and then another guy, and the other guy says, like,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
oh, you have to do it in a ritual.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.320
Okay, sure, beer pong, you can say the same thing.

24:38.320 --> 24:42.520
And it's like, well, there's another ritual.

24:42.520 --> 24:43.760
Oh, there's no ritual schedule

24:43.760 --> 24:45.120
because it's the holidays or something like that.

24:45.120 --> 24:46.960
Or you'll have to schedule and talk to my boss,

24:46.960 --> 24:47.880
there's someone's up.

24:47.880 --> 24:50.080
So I'm like, and I go to Cody and I say,

24:50.080 --> 24:53.240
we have to schedule a ritual if we want to do kava, is that?

24:53.240 --> 24:58.240
And then the pool boy is like, do you want to do kava?

24:59.280 --> 25:01.040
I'm like, yes, pool boy, I do.

25:01.040 --> 25:06.040
And he says, you can do kava with me and my family.

25:09.240 --> 25:12.120
And I'm like, okay, pool boy, please go on.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.000
And he's like, well, you could do it here,

25:14.000 --> 25:15.560
but if you want it, do you want to do it in the village?

25:15.560 --> 25:17.800
And Cody's like, yeah, you're supposed to do it in the village.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.120
That's what I heard, do it in the village.

25:20.120 --> 25:23.080
And I'm like, okay, well, how would we do it in the village?

25:23.080 --> 25:24.720
Well, you know, I'll pick you up.

25:24.720 --> 25:28.400
Like, let's see, I get out of here like seven, eight.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.800
I was like, half past eight, meet me.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.440
I'll just meet me outside,

25:32.440 --> 25:36.560
and I'll take you to my neighborhood and we'll do kava.

25:36.560 --> 25:38.960
And go in the back, in the back,

25:38.960 --> 25:40.680
because the front is like, bleh.

25:40.680 --> 25:44.920
But he's like, everyone in Fiji has this,

25:44.920 --> 25:49.360
it just radiates with this joy, this friendliness,

25:49.360 --> 25:52.080
which if you don't trust them,

25:52.080 --> 25:54.600
makes it seem like the first act of an Eli Roth movie.

25:54.600 --> 25:59.600
Like, not that Eli Roth movies are famous for their structure.

25:59.600 --> 26:03.400
I just like, but they do have first acts.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.800
Thresholds are crossed, and before they are,

26:05.800 --> 26:08.560
people are like, yay, it would take our shirt off

26:08.560 --> 26:10.360
and laugh, have fun, and then everyone's happy,

26:10.360 --> 26:13.040
and then there's these welding torches and things.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.400
So, like he has an ove.

26:15.400 --> 26:20.400
Okay, so he's like, and I made a couple of jokes

26:23.560 --> 26:26.360
because I'm like, I don't want to be offensive.

26:26.360 --> 26:27.880
That would be an awful thing,

26:27.880 --> 26:31.560
but I do also want to say out loud if I'm gonna die,

26:31.560 --> 26:33.280
like, we're not gonna die, are we?

26:33.280 --> 26:36.760
And so I did, and he's like, come on, it's Fiji man, come on.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.000
I'm not trying to do their accent,

26:38.000 --> 26:39.400
it's like part Jamaican part,

26:39.400 --> 26:40.560
like I don't know something else,

26:40.560 --> 26:41.920
like it sounds like they're just,

26:41.920 --> 26:45.240
it's islandy and joyful, and it's all smiles,

26:45.240 --> 26:47.080
and just relax, and so you don't know,

26:47.080 --> 26:49.080
you're just thinking like, I'm gonna die.

26:49.080 --> 26:53.400
So you're doing village kava, not pool boy family kava?

26:53.400 --> 26:55.120
We're doing, no, we're doing,

26:55.120 --> 26:58.400
the village is pool boy's family.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.320
Okay.

26:59.320 --> 27:00.160
Yeah.

27:01.480 --> 27:02.840
We're doing that versus.

27:02.840 --> 27:04.400
But you're not doing the sanctioned hotels or anything.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.720
We're not doing safety belt, like, yeah,

27:06.720 --> 27:09.360
overseeing like candlelight dinner.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.320
You're doing Eli Roth kava.

27:11.320 --> 27:16.040
Yeah, it's like you and Tim Allen's family is joining you

27:16.040 --> 27:19.200
because they also wanted to do kava, like no,

27:19.200 --> 27:20.760
we're not doing that.

27:20.760 --> 27:23.280
We're getting into the pool boy's car

27:23.280 --> 27:26.320
under cover of darkness off of the resort,

27:26.320 --> 27:29.360
passed a sign that says, don't do this,

27:31.120 --> 27:33.120
by a bridge where there was a dog eating,

27:33.120 --> 27:35.600
we don't know what, it could have been another dog.

27:36.960 --> 27:41.640
The dog was stoked, but that could be because,

27:41.640 --> 27:45.440
you know, he won, he was friendly,

27:45.440 --> 27:49.280
but he licked Cody and she was like, oh, he's so cute.

27:49.280 --> 27:52.640
Oh, oh, it was like a rat licked her, you know,

27:52.640 --> 27:55.440
like it was like, he was vermin,

27:55.440 --> 27:57.600
like we think dogs are man's best friend,

27:57.600 --> 28:00.320
but they're vermin's in some places, vermin dog,

28:00.320 --> 28:01.320
it was a vermin dog.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.160
And they run around everywhere, they're just dogs, you know.

28:05.160 --> 28:06.640
You should have a travel show.

28:06.640 --> 28:07.480
Yeah.

28:07.480 --> 28:08.320
You should like.

28:08.320 --> 28:12.640
So we go out to the bridge,

28:12.640 --> 28:14.240
but they put the place where they say,

28:14.240 --> 28:17.080
don't, it says, don't go past this,

28:17.080 --> 28:18.160
the sign to the resort.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.440
Well, they're biased, you know,

28:19.440 --> 28:20.880
of course they want you to stay there.

28:20.880 --> 28:21.720
Yeah.

28:21.720 --> 28:22.800
It's their money.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.360
So, but also that's the same sign they'd have there

28:26.360 --> 28:27.200
if you were going to die.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.360
Remember the crocodile that everyone blamed the family

28:29.360 --> 28:30.920
for, you know, they're an alligator or whatever?

28:30.920 --> 28:32.320
It's like, oh, there was a sign that said,

28:32.320 --> 28:34.200
don't go over here in Disneyland

28:34.200 --> 28:35.880
and they went and the alligator ate their kid.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.880
And everyone was like, there was a thing.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.480
Fucking don't side with a corporation

28:43.480 --> 28:44.800
if a wizard eats your kid.

28:49.480 --> 28:50.840
Can we have one fucking rule

28:50.840 --> 28:53.080
before we all blow ourselves up?

28:53.080 --> 28:54.600
Can we, can we, can we go out

28:54.600 --> 28:57.680
not having sided with lizards?

28:57.680 --> 29:00.520
Do we have to, do we have to get that low before we die?

29:00.520 --> 29:01.960
I was like, I'm with the lizard.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.480
Let the lizard finish.

29:04.680 --> 29:06.320
Hear him out.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.840
I'm just saying, there was a sign.

29:07.840 --> 29:08.680
Chop, chop.

29:14.440 --> 29:17.000
So you and Cody are in the backseat of a guy's car.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.520
So we get to the thing.

29:18.520 --> 29:21.680
And we, it's like, and then the guy's like,

29:21.680 --> 29:22.640
he's not showing up.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.440
And like part of me is like, you know, like good.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.680
Like now I don't look like a pussy in front of Cody,

29:27.680 --> 29:29.920
but also we're not going to die.

29:29.920 --> 29:32.920
So like, we waited a half hour and it's like,

29:32.920 --> 29:35.080
even there's a whole thing, Fiji time, Fiji time,

29:35.080 --> 29:36.280
man, Fiji time.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.560
It's like this joke.

29:37.560 --> 29:39.360
It's like, look, if you have a name for it,

29:39.360 --> 29:41.080
there's like T-shirts that say Fiji time.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.280
It's like a whole thing where it's like,

29:42.280 --> 29:45.000
oh, if you order a drink, you get it a half hour later.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.640
How long did it take you to make the T-shirt?

29:46.640 --> 29:48.320
Fucking, just.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.600
Make the drink, not the T-shirt.

29:51.600 --> 29:54.080
Don't be proud of it.

29:54.080 --> 29:56.520
They're not a tip motivated culture, Jeff.

29:59.960 --> 30:03.240
All that anxiety that makes us shoot each other in the states.

30:03.240 --> 30:07.480
You know, it's that's the dark side of the coin

30:07.480 --> 30:10.040
that results in a little hustle when you order your drink.

30:10.040 --> 30:13.880
Everyone's freaking out and like, they got shit to do.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.240
Then you go to Toronto and they're like grilled cheese.

30:16.240 --> 30:17.800
All right, if I feel like it.

30:17.800 --> 30:20.920
And you go to Australia and they're like, good day.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.920
But good, good morrow, here's your drink.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.360
Whoa, I ordered this yesterday.

30:24.360 --> 30:26.880
It was a good day.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.880
I don't know, I tried to riff a thing.

30:29.880 --> 30:31.160
I'm a world traveler now.

30:31.160 --> 30:34.040
Everyone's slow except America when you order your drink.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.920
That's all I'm going to say about that.

30:36.920 --> 30:42.160
So there's nothing coming.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.040
So we go, OK, good.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.400
Let's just go watch forensic files

30:44.400 --> 30:46.360
so I can continue to be relaxed.

30:46.360 --> 30:49.200
And let's just like, let's just lay in a bed

30:49.200 --> 30:52.400
and there's birds and things that are a little alarming,

30:52.400 --> 30:54.600
but whatever.

30:54.600 --> 30:57.800
So what was Kava?

30:57.800 --> 31:02.080
So then there's headlights.

31:02.080 --> 31:02.960
Oh, there's headlights.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.160
Oh, guys, there's headlights.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.880
And then it's like, that makes it even scarier

31:05.880 --> 31:07.200
because now you really feel like you're

31:07.200 --> 31:10.000
in this fucking Eli Roth movie because there's this moment

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
that the director put in where you could have lived

31:12.000 --> 31:14.400
if you just hadn't fucking walked back.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.160
You had every way to just walk away

31:16.160 --> 31:17.640
and there were headlights and then we all go back.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.960
And I just like, I'm like, so bummed out.

31:19.960 --> 31:21.880
I'm like, all right, let's go.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.680
And it's just a fucking like, shitty, shitty car pulls up.

31:25.680 --> 31:26.800
It's just, dude.

31:26.800 --> 31:29.280
And then also there was just dudes in the bushes.

31:29.280 --> 31:30.560
Like, there had always been there.

31:30.560 --> 31:36.160
I was like, I thought that was the dog coughing the whole time,

31:36.160 --> 31:39.920
but it was just like six people gone.

31:39.920 --> 31:43.520
Like, it was like they just came out of the bushes

31:43.520 --> 31:46.720
to freak us out as we entered the car, even though they weren't

31:46.720 --> 31:47.680
with the people in the car.

31:47.680 --> 31:51.040
But the pool boy gets out and it's like,

31:51.040 --> 31:53.560
with a guy he doesn't introduce, he's smoking a cigarette,

31:53.560 --> 31:56.920
and he's just like, they just open the doors and the pool

31:56.920 --> 32:01.880
boy is like, OK, you ready?

32:04.320 --> 32:07.640
And I'm like, yeah?

32:07.640 --> 32:09.760
And then we get in the car and I'm just like,

32:09.760 --> 32:13.800
hanging on to that thing you never hang on to, not

32:13.800 --> 32:16.720
because they're driving fast, but just because I'm like,

32:16.720 --> 32:18.800
it's just something you do when you're freaked out.

32:18.800 --> 32:22.640
Like, you're just like, choo, choo.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.680
And they're playing music and they're strangers.

32:25.680 --> 32:30.120
And it's like, if the physical realities of what we were doing

32:30.120 --> 32:32.040
were happening in the States, you'd be like,

32:32.040 --> 32:34.240
I think I might be in big trouble here.

32:34.240 --> 32:39.720
And you're trying to think, am I carrying bigoted first world

32:39.720 --> 32:43.240
contaminated toxicity into this situation?

32:43.240 --> 32:46.680
Is this a story about me being an ignorant, white,

32:46.680 --> 32:52.320
like fucking pig-headed, like judgmental, toxic person?

32:52.320 --> 32:55.040
Or is this going to be one of those stories where it's like,

32:55.040 --> 32:56.680
what were they thinking?

32:56.680 --> 32:59.320
Like, the editors of Dateline would be like,

32:59.320 --> 33:02.240
this doesn't even merit an episode.

33:02.240 --> 33:10.800
Just send it to whoever replaced Bob Saget if there's video,

33:10.800 --> 33:13.640
assuming there's some video involved.

33:13.640 --> 33:16.840
Because I think it'll be funny because they deserved it

33:16.840 --> 33:17.800
because they didn't listen.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.680
They went to a different country and they just

33:19.680 --> 33:22.320
got in a stranger's car, like fuck them.

33:22.320 --> 33:23.800
Are we in an urban legend?

33:23.800 --> 33:26.000
Or are we the urban legend?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.680
Are we the fucking dumb shitheads?

33:28.680 --> 33:30.080
So I'm trying to split the difference

33:30.080 --> 33:33.840
so I'm being just silently terrified and not going,

33:33.840 --> 33:35.120
you're not going to kill us, right?

33:35.120 --> 33:40.600
And Cody's is talking and going like, so do you have family?

33:40.600 --> 33:43.040
I'm thinking, good, smart Cody, smart.

33:43.040 --> 33:44.000
Humanize them.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.960
Yeah, yeah, I have a daughter.

33:50.960 --> 33:52.080
What's your daughter's name?

33:52.080 --> 33:54.360
Good, genius, Cody, genius.

33:54.360 --> 33:57.000
It's Marianne, and my wife's name is such a size.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.160
Good, good, good.

33:59.160 --> 34:01.960
So it's having a half hour drive.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.560
And he says, oh, and then first you

34:03.560 --> 34:06.040
have to go buy the kava.

34:06.040 --> 34:09.200
This liquor store is just made out of chicken wire,

34:09.200 --> 34:10.840
and it smells like a diaper.

34:10.840 --> 34:15.840
And you get a big case of shitty beer, and you pay them,

34:15.840 --> 34:17.840
and it's all prearranged anyway.

34:17.840 --> 34:18.960
It's like all the prices are.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.040
They just get a big newspaper bundle full of this root

34:22.040 --> 34:25.520
that is mystical.

34:25.520 --> 34:29.640
And I'll take a newspaper load of mystical roots

34:29.640 --> 34:35.520
and some jolly ranchers and a Michelob ultra.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.320
And then you get back in the car, you go to the thing,

34:38.320 --> 34:40.600
and he goes like, when we pull up to the house,

34:40.600 --> 34:42.520
my whole family's going to come out.

34:42.520 --> 34:44.320
And they're going to be standing out there,

34:44.320 --> 34:45.880
and they're going to say, boo la boo la.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.920
And when you get out, just say, boo la boo la.

34:47.920 --> 34:48.600
You're going to love it.

34:48.600 --> 34:49.400
It's going to be great.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.720
You're going to love my family, man.

34:50.720 --> 34:52.160
And then they only pull in.

34:52.160 --> 34:55.200
That's how you get killed.

34:55.200 --> 35:01.280
And there's just like a dude by a mailbox,

35:01.280 --> 35:03.360
and he's smoking a cigarette, and he sees the car,

35:03.360 --> 35:06.640
and he makes a gesture at the guy, I think,

35:06.640 --> 35:09.400
and then the other driver's like, oh, and then the other guy's

35:09.400 --> 35:12.240
like, oh, well, it says something.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.040
I mean, that sounds like a la Akbar, didn't I?

35:14.040 --> 35:21.560
The guys, there's no family outside this Texas

35:21.560 --> 35:26.000
chainsaw massacre hut that there's just guys in the darkness

35:26.000 --> 35:28.160
that you can only see them because they can't stop smoking.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.720
There's just like little orange clothes that just,

35:30.720 --> 35:32.400
and then they're gone, and then you just

35:32.400 --> 35:36.480
like darting eyes and like fucking like, step out.

35:36.480 --> 35:37.920
And there's no family out here.

35:37.920 --> 35:40.640
We're like, we step out, and there's like one dude comes out,

35:40.640 --> 35:50.040
and we're like, boo la boo la, and then we go into the house.

35:50.040 --> 35:50.600
What?

35:50.600 --> 35:54.000
Oh, there was a fucking tomb, yes, there was.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.120
I think it was a tomb.

35:55.120 --> 35:59.200
There was like a memorial plaque on top of a six foot

35:59.200 --> 36:05.000
by two foot by three foot high cement rectangle.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.840
Had to be a tomb.

36:07.840 --> 36:13.200
Anyways, so we walk into the place,

36:13.200 --> 36:17.360
and there's his whole family, and his wife,

36:17.360 --> 36:19.240
and their beautiful little girl, and everyone's like,

36:19.240 --> 36:21.800
boo la boo la, and it's like, it's fucking fine.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.040
Everything's fine, because I am a bigot in a asshole

36:24.040 --> 36:26.360
and a fucking jerk.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.800
Because immediately it was just like,

36:27.800 --> 36:29.400
you could see the expression on their face,

36:29.400 --> 36:31.760
and then they had a bull out, and they knew we were coming,

36:31.760 --> 36:32.960
and they couldn't wait, and all this shit.

36:32.960 --> 36:35.480
And it was just like, oh, fuck.

36:35.480 --> 36:40.320
And the crazy thing is, how quickly, how sure I could be

36:40.320 --> 36:46.000
that man is evil, that there's no fucking way.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.160
I just thought, all the calculations

36:47.160 --> 36:48.720
I was doing in the car on the way there,

36:48.720 --> 36:52.400
was like, I just kept thinking, well,

36:52.400 --> 36:53.840
there's no way we're going to die,

36:53.840 --> 36:58.840
because he'd never get away with it.

36:58.840 --> 37:02.840
There would be no profit in it, so that would be stupid

37:02.840 --> 37:04.880
to kill us, and then the thing that started freaking me out

37:04.880 --> 37:07.360
was like, who says criminals aren't stupid?

37:07.360 --> 37:10.280
Like, what if it's his first murder?

37:10.280 --> 37:11.880
Did that happen all the time?

37:11.880 --> 37:15.240
The prisons are overflowing with bad murderers.

37:15.240 --> 37:16.200
They're just bad at it.

37:16.200 --> 37:16.960
They're just dumb.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.200
They're just like, I'm going to try killing a bunch of people

37:19.200 --> 37:21.400
and see if that will make me a bunch of money.

37:21.400 --> 37:25.080
And they're wrong, but that's of no comfort to the victims.

37:25.080 --> 37:30.000
Anyways, what I never bothered to think during the entire car

37:30.000 --> 37:34.560
ride was, oh, we're not going to die, because man is good.

37:34.560 --> 37:36.960
It's actually all that stuff that you are always

37:36.960 --> 37:39.880
running your mouth about as a hippie, and a liberal,

37:39.880 --> 37:44.200
and a nerd, and it's like, oh, all that stuff is actually

37:44.200 --> 37:46.400
true, and if there's an island small enough,

37:46.400 --> 37:48.320
you'll find that out, because there's like a million people

37:48.320 --> 37:52.120
that live there, and they're just like happy and don't really,

37:52.120 --> 37:55.400
they don't fucking think about murdering people all the time.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.120
It's just not something that runs through their head,

37:57.120 --> 37:58.680
so they're neither good nor bad at it,

37:58.680 --> 38:00.560
nor do they ever think to even bother to say,

38:00.560 --> 38:02.360
by the way, I know this looks like a murderer car,

38:02.360 --> 38:04.160
but they wouldn't think that.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.000
They wouldn't be like looking at their car and going,

38:06.000 --> 38:09.920
like, come on, Jacob, make it look less murdery.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.760
Spray the hubcaps a little.

38:11.760 --> 38:13.200
There's murder dust on them.

38:13.200 --> 38:20.200
The, you know, murdery, so like, I never thought about that.

38:21.360 --> 38:25.240
The weird thing is how convinced I was that I was gonna die,

38:25.240 --> 38:28.880
and how specific my map of the universe was,

38:28.880 --> 38:30.520
how definite it was.

38:30.520 --> 38:35.120
The really weird thing is that how it took eight seconds

38:35.120 --> 38:40.120
for it to go completely away, and that how comfortable

38:40.440 --> 38:42.520
I was with being that wrong.

38:42.520 --> 38:45.200
How I immediately then was like, oh yeah, yeah,

38:45.200 --> 38:48.320
then there's that other version of the universe,

38:48.320 --> 38:51.320
that you're also 100% convinced is real.

38:51.320 --> 38:54.280
Where shit bad shit doesn't happen, you just have,

38:54.280 --> 38:56.840
you know, that was the weird thing about the experience,

38:56.840 --> 39:00.200
was like looking within myself and going like,

39:00.200 --> 39:02.280
wait, do I even have a brain?

39:02.280 --> 39:03.520
Do I even have an identity?

39:03.520 --> 39:04.640
Do I have a point of view?

39:04.640 --> 39:07.640
Like, is this country just like,

39:07.640 --> 39:12.240
are we just like unimprinted, unindulcturated drones,

39:12.240 --> 39:17.240
that are like, spit out of like a little metal dish?

39:19.360 --> 39:24.000
And I'm like, we're kind of like-

39:24.000 --> 39:25.800
You started a show calling me drunk.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.680
We're kind of intentionally,

39:29.680 --> 39:32.240
I didn't know drunk was an insult to you.

39:32.240 --> 39:35.560
I have a scratchy voice, and I'm being inarticulate.

39:35.560 --> 39:36.400
All right, well.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.880
I was just making a joke to you, man.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.600
I've said it on stage before, like, hey man,

39:39.600 --> 39:40.440
are you drunk?

39:40.440 --> 39:42.000
And sometimes you've been like, you bit your tits.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Like, I just thought it was,

39:44.000 --> 39:49.000
I didn't know, I didn't know, man.

39:49.400 --> 39:54.400
All right, so, they sang us a song.

39:54.400 --> 39:55.840
It was an amazing night, like this guy.

39:55.840 --> 39:58.120
Wait, what's the song?

39:58.120 --> 39:59.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.400
They get up and sing a number?

40:00.400 --> 40:01.920
Yeah, yeah, they sang us a song.

40:01.920 --> 40:06.680
I have the recording of it, but it was a great night.

40:06.680 --> 40:09.280
It was like, some of the most valuable things

40:09.280 --> 40:11.040
that I got from them, because it was like,

40:11.040 --> 40:12.400
again, we started talking about politics,

40:12.400 --> 40:13.720
and they were like, yeah, like,

40:13.720 --> 40:15.840
it's not good here right now, like, politically,

40:15.840 --> 40:19.840
but it's not a Fijian's job to deal with that shit.

40:19.840 --> 40:21.240
Like, we do what we're told.

40:21.240 --> 40:22.880
It's like, just say this shit that, like,

40:22.880 --> 40:24.400
as Americans, we just go like,

40:25.400 --> 40:26.720
it's almost like you get mad at them.

40:26.720 --> 40:27.800
Like, you're like, fuck you.

40:27.800 --> 40:32.320
Like, it's like, we think you're a bad person

40:32.320 --> 40:35.160
if you don't figure out who to be mad at

40:35.160 --> 40:36.680
and what to do about it.

40:36.680 --> 40:39.560
And yet, we're not really getting anywhere with that.

40:39.560 --> 40:43.480
Like, and I'm not saying they're flying around like Jetsons.

40:43.480 --> 40:48.480
Like, they're not, they're living in plywood lean twos,

40:48.680 --> 40:51.280
and then they're saying things like,

40:51.280 --> 40:53.600
like, when you say it's beautiful here,

40:53.600 --> 40:54.520
they always say thank you.

40:54.520 --> 40:55.560
Would you say that if you were like,

40:55.560 --> 40:57.560
it's like, every Western kind of like,

40:57.560 --> 40:58.840
go to London, and they go like,

40:58.840 --> 41:00.960
that's beautiful here, and the Londoner goes like,

41:00.960 --> 41:04.680
pfft, but they always go like, they go thank you.

41:04.680 --> 41:08.560
Like, you complimented them because they're very proud

41:08.560 --> 41:12.200
of how they live in paradise, and they all,

41:12.200 --> 41:15.520
like they just do this thing, or they keep talking about,

41:15.520 --> 41:17.880
I don't know if it's a talking point that was like,

41:17.880 --> 41:20.840
sent down to everybody, or they keep going,

41:20.840 --> 41:22.200
because you hear it on the airplane,

41:22.200 --> 41:23.720
and then you hear it from the driver,

41:23.720 --> 41:26.080
and then you hear it, it just keeps coming up like,

41:26.080 --> 41:27.640
by the way, thank you so much.

41:27.640 --> 41:30.560
Your tourism dollars like, are really helpful here.

41:30.560 --> 41:32.880
That's like, that's maybe 80% of their economy there.

41:32.880 --> 41:35.920
Like, they might have one or two agricultural products,

41:35.920 --> 41:38.200
and then tourism is the main revenue there.

41:38.200 --> 41:41.120
So they're quite happy to have like, tourists there.

41:41.120 --> 41:42.240
Yeah, because otherwise they'd be working

41:42.240 --> 41:43.440
in the sugar cane fields, as they say,

41:43.440 --> 41:46.080
but it's like, that's still no reason to like,

41:46.080 --> 41:48.880
in my mind, to thank me, because as I explained to them,

41:48.880 --> 41:50.120
I'm like, I don't want to bum you out,

41:50.120 --> 41:52.080
but you probably know I didn't come here

41:52.080 --> 41:53.880
to do you a favor.

41:53.880 --> 41:55.840
Also, I thought most of you are murderers.

41:55.840 --> 41:58.120
Yeah, I did tell them that, I mean,

41:58.120 --> 41:59.840
I've been telling them, yeah,

41:59.840 --> 42:04.840
before they murdered me, but they were so,

42:04.840 --> 42:08.320
yeah, and I don't know, they're just like, when you have troubles,

42:08.320 --> 42:10.120
like they lift you up or something like that,

42:10.120 --> 42:11.720
I can't remember it, I should have written it down,

42:11.720 --> 42:14.360
but they said something really inspiring.

42:15.640 --> 42:16.480
And then they,

42:17.840 --> 42:19.960
they said, it's all about the people,

42:19.960 --> 42:21.480
and it's all about how you react to things.

42:21.480 --> 42:23.480
You know, like, if you're having a shitty time,

42:23.480 --> 42:25.400
if you're as a culture, as a tribe, as a village,

42:25.400 --> 42:30.040
as a country, like, it's, the thing that defines you

42:30.040 --> 42:33.120
is not whether you fight it, whether you don't,

42:33.120 --> 42:35.320
whether you say something right or wrong,

42:35.320 --> 42:39.000
it's just how you face that thing,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.640
like who you are when you either go down or prevail,

42:42.640 --> 42:47.040
like, and the way to make sure you're on the right side

42:47.040 --> 42:49.520
of everything is to side with people.

42:49.520 --> 42:51.560
It's starting with your family,

42:51.560 --> 42:54.600
then very close second, your entire village,

42:54.600 --> 42:55.920
because they are your family,

42:55.920 --> 43:00.520
and then your entire species is a close third,

43:00.520 --> 43:02.000
if not tied for second,

43:02.000 --> 43:03.600
and if that means that bad guys

43:03.600 --> 43:04.960
are gonna take advantage of you and say,

43:04.960 --> 43:07.400
oh, now we own this, and you get to live in a tire swing,

43:07.400 --> 43:10.880
well, okay, then that's what they do.

43:10.880 --> 43:13.560
And it's like, it's not like, oh, let's all go do that,

43:13.560 --> 43:16.760
like, I think, you know, but it was also like,

43:16.760 --> 43:19.240
oh, geez, like, there's really,

43:19.240 --> 43:20.680
there's really only one wrong way

43:20.680 --> 43:22.760
to handle what we're dealing with right now,

43:22.760 --> 43:24.760
in this time, in our world,

43:24.760 --> 43:29.760
and that's to be, like, to let them make us pissy,

43:29.760 --> 43:33.160
like, while we're going down or up.

43:33.160 --> 43:35.080
Like, if whether we win or lose,

43:35.080 --> 43:38.200
if we got too fucking uncharismatic

43:38.200 --> 43:39.120
while we were doing it,

43:39.120 --> 43:41.440
like, then they would have won that victory too,

43:41.440 --> 43:42.320
and it's like, just sucks,

43:42.320 --> 43:47.240
because you just get the sense that a big part of this war

43:47.240 --> 43:49.680
that we're in right now is,

43:49.680 --> 43:51.840
it's between dumb people and smart people,

43:51.840 --> 43:53.920
it's between uncool people and cool people,

43:53.920 --> 43:56.720
and like, they are a little sick and tired

43:56.720 --> 43:59.560
of all the cool, smart people running everything,

43:59.560 --> 44:02.360
and they're actually openly saying that,

44:02.360 --> 44:06.000
so you gotta think, I think they're already lost,

44:06.000 --> 44:06.840
and they know that,

44:06.840 --> 44:08.880
and that makes them the most dangerous opponent of all

44:08.880 --> 44:10.880
if we continue to be surprised

44:10.880 --> 44:12.320
that they won't listen to reason,

44:12.320 --> 44:13.920
if we continue, we just gotta like,

44:13.920 --> 44:14.760
look at this as like,

44:14.760 --> 44:17.000
there's a fucking werewolf in our house,

44:17.000 --> 44:18.680
is it, or is it something like,

44:18.680 --> 44:21.520
vermin dog just wandered in the,

44:21.520 --> 44:24.080
we spent the days after the election going like,

44:24.080 --> 44:27.120
okay, well, are we gonna handle this like,

44:27.120 --> 44:28.520
we forgot the rust belt,

44:28.520 --> 44:29.360
and then there's other people going,

44:29.360 --> 44:31.320
I'm sick of that shit, fuck the rust belt,

44:31.320 --> 44:33.640
and we all got confused,

44:33.640 --> 44:35.280
and like, how do we handle this,

44:35.280 --> 44:37.800
what do we do, still don't know,

44:37.800 --> 44:39.160
but I just know that like,

44:39.160 --> 44:41.040
this is death staring us in the face,

44:41.040 --> 44:44.840
and like, you know, we may be two inches

44:44.840 --> 44:46.400
from our flipper touching sand,

44:47.840 --> 44:51.640
or we may have just swam into the Baltic on accident,

44:51.640 --> 44:54.320
and this is it, but in either case,

44:54.320 --> 44:55.520
you know, don't yell at your girlfriend

44:55.520 --> 44:56.880
when you're going down.

44:56.880 --> 45:00.440
Grab her, grab her, grab her butt,

45:00.440 --> 45:05.440
and, and do as I say, not as I do,

45:08.680 --> 45:10.760
because I have yet to follow this rule,

45:10.760 --> 45:12.720
I'm fucking pissed, and I hate,

45:12.720 --> 45:14.520
and I'm afraid, and I'm,

45:15.440 --> 45:18.560
you know, this guy admires a fucking autocrat

45:18.560 --> 45:21.200
that murders, murders people,

45:21.200 --> 45:22.600
just plain and simple, murders,

45:22.600 --> 45:25.360
first journalists, like first and foremost,

45:25.360 --> 45:27.680
which like, in our culture is supposed to be

45:27.680 --> 45:31.080
like the fucking like, sin of all sins,

45:31.080 --> 45:33.840
like not, oh, it's like, it's like,

45:33.840 --> 45:35.280
it's like, you know, like when,

45:35.280 --> 45:38.320
when the 1920s Chicago stuff was happening,

45:38.320 --> 45:41.240
like, the thing that ended it all in the public's eye

45:41.240 --> 45:43.080
as a journalist got shot, you know,

45:43.080 --> 45:45.360
like, like, so one of the gang, gang families,

45:45.360 --> 45:46.760
like they just, they didn't like

45:46.760 --> 45:48.240
how they got written about by,

45:48.240 --> 45:49.800
and there wasn't even, journalism wasn't even like

45:49.800 --> 45:52.600
in its peak form back then,

45:52.600 --> 45:54.240
it was almost worse than now,

45:54.240 --> 45:58.000
but still it was like, hey, you don't do that,

45:58.000 --> 45:59.720
you don't fucking like, shoot a guy

45:59.720 --> 46:01.080
that writes for a newspaper

46:01.080 --> 46:03.240
because you're having a disagreement with here,

46:03.240 --> 46:04.840
but now we're just like, fuck it,

46:04.840 --> 46:06.800
like, Putin just fucking murders,

46:06.800 --> 46:08.560
just look it up, look at the list of people

46:08.560 --> 46:09.720
that he's just murders, he's just orders.

46:09.720 --> 46:12.440
His day job was the KGB, those were the people

46:12.440 --> 46:13.680
that pulled you out of your house

46:13.680 --> 46:16.960
and shot you in the head, like that was his day job.

46:16.960 --> 46:19.280
And Trump openly admires him on Twitter

46:19.280 --> 46:22.680
for our fucking amusement and says like,

46:22.680 --> 46:25.960
he's got it going on better than abroad being president.

46:25.960 --> 46:28.280
And it's like, we're gonna fucking die,

46:28.280 --> 46:31.960
but it's like, we can't be shocked by it,

46:31.960 --> 46:34.200
we gotta be like, we're gonna fucking die.

46:38.120 --> 46:40.120
It's just different from like the Richard Lewis,

46:40.120 --> 46:42.040
we're gonna die, you know, like, like,

46:42.040 --> 46:43.400
we don't need Richard Lewis right now,

46:43.400 --> 46:46.840
we need, we need Bill Gates.

46:46.840 --> 46:49.000
Richard Lewis was a comedian back in the 80s,

46:49.000 --> 46:52.680
very neurotic, he panicked a lot.

46:53.680 --> 46:55.200
But I'm not saying he's a bad person

46:55.200 --> 46:58.280
if he wants to come on the show and talk about it.

46:58.280 --> 46:59.200
I love Richard Lewis.

46:59.200 --> 47:01.440
I just mean, as far as our spirit animals are concerned,

47:01.440 --> 47:03.120
we need to go with more of a...

47:03.120 --> 47:07.080
More of a, what's the comic that we should be going for?

47:07.080 --> 47:10.240
I think Ancia, I don't know.

47:10.240 --> 47:11.480
Yeah.

47:11.480 --> 47:12.480
I don't know.

47:13.920 --> 47:16.240
Stan Hope, we need to be more Stan Hopish.

47:16.240 --> 47:19.080
We need to have Stan Hope.

47:19.080 --> 47:22.440
I hear female voices grumbling.

47:22.440 --> 47:25.120
I mean, like, there's, how about this,

47:25.120 --> 47:26.680
there's no, there are no heroes,

47:26.680 --> 47:31.680
like we're, let the other team think that the idea

47:32.960 --> 47:34.480
is that you need a perfect quarterback

47:34.480 --> 47:36.080
and then your team can win all that stuff.

47:36.080 --> 47:37.920
I think the thing that they resent about us

47:37.920 --> 47:39.600
is that they think that we're like a sexless,

47:39.600 --> 47:43.360
raceless, hoard, a bored cube that's gonna swallow them up.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.200
Let's just let them be right about that

47:45.200 --> 47:49.080
and stop waiting for some like fucking superhuman Tom Cruisey

47:49.080 --> 47:52.200
but not offensively Tom Cruisey guy to lead us all

47:52.200 --> 47:55.320
because it's like, let's just be a committee,

47:55.320 --> 47:56.680
like, which is what they've always feared

47:56.680 --> 47:57.800
and what I've always resisted,

47:57.800 --> 48:00.600
but let's just have common sense and be like, yeah,

48:00.600 --> 48:03.120
it's hard to be a throng of people

48:03.120 --> 48:06.560
that tries to make sure that everybody is relatively safe.

48:06.560 --> 48:08.520
It looks a little bit like this.

48:08.520 --> 48:11.040
It doesn't look like Bill Pullman's speech

48:11.040 --> 48:12.200
in Independence Day.

48:12.200 --> 48:14.600
That doesn't work in real life though.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.520
Like, if you want to save the economy

48:16.520 --> 48:18.840
and the ecology and the equality,

48:18.840 --> 48:21.720
you have to like actually just spread it out

48:21.720 --> 48:24.120
and run things by relative commission.

48:24.120 --> 48:24.960
What am I talking about?

48:24.960 --> 48:29.960
All right, so they sang this song and Cody recorded it.

48:34.720 --> 48:36.800
This is the ending of the song.

48:36.800 --> 48:37.960
It's this beautiful, you know,

48:37.960 --> 48:39.240
they say like, when you sing this song,

48:39.240 --> 48:40.280
they have this whole preamble.

48:40.280 --> 48:41.560
Yeah, paint the picture.

48:41.560 --> 48:43.240
You're in somebody's home right now?

48:43.240 --> 48:46.880
Yeah, it's like, just imagine like really like the poorest,

48:46.880 --> 48:50.160
like, we're sitting on the floor,

48:50.160 --> 48:51.920
there's like, and on the floor, there's like that.

48:51.920 --> 48:53.200
I'm getting notes from Levy.

48:53.200 --> 48:54.200
Levy was there too?

48:54.200 --> 48:56.040
Yeah, yeah.

48:56.040 --> 48:58.440
Levy, come out, do you want to come out and...

48:58.440 --> 48:59.280
Steve Levy.

49:04.560 --> 49:09.560
Yeah, I'm not gonna go do altered states drugs

49:10.280 --> 49:11.520
without my assistant.

49:11.520 --> 49:16.520
I remember the car ride there,

49:17.320 --> 49:19.560
I turned to Cody and I whispered to her,

49:19.560 --> 49:22.320
I was like, I'm so scared.

49:22.320 --> 49:23.400
She was like, don't be.

49:23.400 --> 49:25.120
But I was like, look at Dan.

49:25.120 --> 49:27.960
He, Dan, Dan was like this.

49:33.480 --> 49:34.680
See Dan, I always thought of you

49:34.680 --> 49:37.680
as a very intrepid adventurer and voyager.

49:37.680 --> 49:42.160
Yeah, I mean, I'm a real thrill seeker

49:42.160 --> 49:44.440
when it comes to what I eat and drink.

49:44.440 --> 49:48.480
It was a pretty incredible experience.

49:48.480 --> 49:53.400
I was terrified, the whole waiting for them to come

49:53.400 --> 49:56.520
and then the exchange and then getting in the car

49:56.520 --> 49:59.320
and driving into the middle of nowhere.

49:59.320 --> 50:02.520
Okay, so then they go, so we have a great time.

50:02.520 --> 50:03.360
You're sitting on the...

50:03.360 --> 50:04.960
Yeah, they walked us through the village

50:04.960 --> 50:06.840
and it was, there were no lights,

50:06.840 --> 50:07.880
so there's no light pollution.

50:07.880 --> 50:09.840
And it was, you've never seen stars like this

50:09.840 --> 50:10.880
in your entire life.

50:10.880 --> 50:12.680
You literally haven't because we're in a different part

50:12.680 --> 50:14.560
of the planet where you can't even see the Big Dipper.

50:14.560 --> 50:15.520
It's a different constellation.

50:15.520 --> 50:17.960
Yeah, yeah, you're seeing different stars, which is awesome.

50:17.960 --> 50:19.480
They call it the Big Dipper.

50:20.480 --> 50:22.840
They have a medium sized Dipper over there.

50:24.840 --> 50:26.680
We've been looking for it forever.

50:26.680 --> 50:27.520
Awesome.

50:27.520 --> 50:29.800
Also, they tore apart our cosmic kitchen.

50:29.800 --> 50:31.080
They have one constellation.

50:31.080 --> 50:32.480
Where's our medium Dipper?

50:32.480 --> 50:36.920
There's one constellation called Orion's Bracelets.

50:38.920 --> 50:42.280
It's good, this fucking belt is useless with that.

50:42.280 --> 50:44.280
Where am I Orion's Bracelet?

50:46.280 --> 50:49.800
Where's Orion's personal good that I bought with that belt?

50:51.200 --> 50:52.400
The whole point of it.

50:54.600 --> 50:58.480
So, yeah, it's like a thatched, like what do you,

50:58.480 --> 51:00.600
they have like a mat on the floor.

51:00.600 --> 51:02.320
It was like a, yeah, it was like what?

51:02.320 --> 51:03.800
I don't think they probably roll out for company.

51:03.800 --> 51:04.880
A reed mat, maybe?

51:04.880 --> 51:06.080
Yeah, yeah.

51:06.080 --> 51:08.080
And they, there are a lot of bugs everywhere.

51:08.080 --> 51:09.600
There's big cockroaches.

51:09.600 --> 51:12.200
Lizards, lizards crawling on the walls.

51:12.200 --> 51:14.320
And there was an American flag on the wall.

51:14.320 --> 51:16.280
We're like, why is that there?

51:16.280 --> 51:17.920
And they're like, we heard you were coming.

51:17.920 --> 51:21.640
We're actually a, it was a joke though.

51:21.640 --> 51:24.560
We were the first Americans that they'd had in there.

51:24.560 --> 51:28.360
It's usually Australians that they entreat to this.

51:28.360 --> 51:31.600
But, so why is the, what's that American flag up there?

51:31.600 --> 51:32.880
And they'd made the joke of like,

51:32.880 --> 51:33.720
oh, you're expecting it?

51:33.720 --> 51:35.040
And we're like, no, come on.

51:35.040 --> 51:36.440
And they're like, no, one of their,

51:36.440 --> 51:40.080
his cousin was in the Fijian Navy,

51:41.200 --> 51:43.840
which is just, it's those four kids

51:43.840 --> 51:45.640
who are laughing at me about the crab.

51:45.640 --> 51:50.640
I kid Fiji's Navy because I'm safe.

51:52.520 --> 51:56.320
The, but no, in the Fiji military,

51:56.320 --> 51:57.320
I think the Navy, I assume,

51:57.320 --> 52:02.320
and then there was like a, she met an American Navy guy

52:03.560 --> 52:05.720
and he gave her an American flag

52:05.720 --> 52:07.320
and she gave him a Fiji flag

52:07.320 --> 52:09.920
and he's hanging her Fiji flag at his apartment.

52:09.920 --> 52:10.760
And they have it.

52:10.760 --> 52:11.600
It was very nice.

52:11.600 --> 52:12.920
A lot of stuff like that where it was just like,

52:12.920 --> 52:13.840
this is fucking beautiful.

52:13.840 --> 52:16.720
And we drank this like mud water that's like,

52:16.720 --> 52:19.560
they're, they present as if it's like,

52:19.560 --> 52:22.440
they're like buckle up and it's like, all right.

52:22.440 --> 52:24.040
The reason we went into the village

52:24.040 --> 52:25.440
was we want to see the village,

52:25.440 --> 52:26.880
but they said at the hotel, it's like,

52:26.880 --> 52:28.760
yeah, this, the cover that we have here

52:28.760 --> 52:31.520
is just kind of like the industrial, like it,

52:31.520 --> 52:32.360
it's watered down.

52:32.360 --> 52:33.680
I think you can buy this stuff at Greenwich Village.

52:33.680 --> 52:36.200
It's a relative of the chili plant, but it's like,

52:36.200 --> 52:37.960
I think you might get your head cut off there

52:37.960 --> 52:38.800
for smoking weed.

52:38.800 --> 52:39.840
So maybe they're like lightweights.

52:39.840 --> 52:41.520
I don't know, but they, they're like,

52:41.520 --> 52:43.360
it was like, you think it was ayahuasca

52:43.360 --> 52:44.720
the way they talked about it?

52:44.720 --> 52:45.560
But, and then you drink it

52:45.560 --> 52:47.160
and you're like, ah, tastes like dirt.

52:47.160 --> 52:48.360
And then you drink a bunch of cheap beer

52:48.360 --> 52:49.360
until you get drunk.

52:49.360 --> 52:50.200
Uh.

52:50.200 --> 52:54.000
How many people are in this room?

52:54.000 --> 52:55.880
Uh, like tea?

52:55.880 --> 52:58.440
Yeah, it was, it was, it was a good amount of people.

52:58.440 --> 52:59.760
Did you count Mary Ann?

52:59.760 --> 53:01.320
Is that way we got our count wrong?

53:01.320 --> 53:02.680
This is the most adorable little girl

53:02.680 --> 53:03.520
you've ever seen in your life.

53:03.520 --> 53:04.600
Steve took some great pictures

53:04.600 --> 53:06.680
where he had his big ass camera.

53:06.680 --> 53:09.160
All the kids are like walking around with giant iPhone,

53:09.160 --> 53:10.320
giant relative to their bodies,

53:10.320 --> 53:12.360
giant iPhones staring at the screens

53:12.360 --> 53:15.120
and like, like, like dogs running around.

53:16.120 --> 53:17.520
All right, so, so then they go,

53:17.520 --> 53:19.040
okay, so before you go,

53:21.640 --> 53:22.560
we sing this song.

53:22.560 --> 53:24.600
It's like, and then it's an ancient tradition

53:24.600 --> 53:28.040
and like, like, like, like in Fiji, everyone, you know,

53:28.040 --> 53:30.600
there's no, like fences are offensive.

53:30.600 --> 53:31.520
Oh, I like that.

53:31.520 --> 53:32.840
Uh.

53:32.840 --> 53:34.440
I take offense.

53:35.440 --> 53:40.160
The song was about when, when the men went off to war

53:40.160 --> 53:43.640
and the women and children, it was a song like-

53:43.640 --> 53:45.360
Invented the alphabet.

53:46.400 --> 53:50.480
It was a song essentially celebrating the men's life

53:50.480 --> 53:54.400
and thanking them for, for their going to war,

53:54.400 --> 53:56.200
but also for giving them whatever-

53:56.200 --> 53:57.200
You really paid attention.

53:57.200 --> 53:58.040
Yeah, well-

53:58.040 --> 53:59.640
Have you seen Atlanta?

53:59.640 --> 54:00.480
Yeah.

54:00.480 --> 54:01.320
Okay, good.

54:01.320 --> 54:03.680
I need you to brief me in the car on the way home.

54:05.480 --> 54:08.520
The, the, so, so, yeah,

54:08.520 --> 54:09.760
so we're going to sing you this song

54:09.760 --> 54:11.280
and it's, it's, it's, you'll hear it

54:11.280 --> 54:12.840
and it's like, it's, it's gorgeous.

54:12.840 --> 54:14.840
It sounds like a Paul Simon album and-

54:14.840 --> 54:16.120
They all harmonized.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.760
Like it was just like built in.

54:17.760 --> 54:19.520
Some of them are just on Instagram

54:19.520 --> 54:20.520
and like kind of giggling.

54:20.520 --> 54:24.120
Is this pre-Cava, during-Cava or post-Cava?

54:24.120 --> 54:24.960
This is post-Cava.

54:24.960 --> 54:26.160
We're like ready to go home.

54:26.160 --> 54:27.000
Okay.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.200
Yeah, Frito was like falling asleep, sitting up.

54:29.200 --> 54:30.160
Frito's there too?

54:30.160 --> 54:31.000
Yeah.

54:31.000 --> 54:31.840
Okay.

54:31.840 --> 54:33.120
My friend from, that we've met on the podcast,

54:33.120 --> 54:35.960
my high school friend Dave Frito was there.

54:35.960 --> 54:38.400
Comey, Cody, Steve Levy and Frito.

54:38.400 --> 54:39.360
So then they sing this song

54:39.360 --> 54:40.880
and so then we'll move on from Fiji,

54:40.880 --> 54:43.480
but let's see.

54:43.480 --> 54:46.440
And so you'll hear trains in the background and cars.

54:46.440 --> 54:48.920
These guys are wearing like soccer jerseys

54:48.920 --> 54:50.560
and Britney Spears concert shirts.

54:50.560 --> 54:53.760
It's like, it's, it's not, there's not like a pretense

54:53.760 --> 54:55.920
in that culture of like, we're one with nature.

54:55.920 --> 54:58.280
It's just, it's, they live in paradise.

54:58.280 --> 54:59.600
They live in poverty.

54:59.600 --> 55:02.240
They love that they get to go work at a resort

55:02.240 --> 55:03.520
instead of a sugar cane field.

55:03.520 --> 55:05.280
But there's like no, and they're not like,

55:05.280 --> 55:06.960
don't take pictures and don't do any of that.

55:06.960 --> 55:08.360
It's just like, it was kind of a weird thing

55:08.360 --> 55:09.200
to wrap my brain around.

55:09.200 --> 55:10.800
It wasn't like, like, you talk to other people

55:10.800 --> 55:12.200
that go like, oh, I went to the Serengeti

55:12.200 --> 55:14.720
and they made a, I took out my phone and they said,

55:14.720 --> 55:16.720
ah, ah, ah, and they made a phone out of a tree.

55:16.720 --> 55:18.000
And then they're like, this is our phone.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.600
And like, the sun came down.

55:20.600 --> 55:22.240
And it's like, you're not allowed to have aluminum there

55:22.240 --> 55:24.520
because it was, but this isn't like that.

55:24.520 --> 55:26.480
It was just like, so you just hear these guys,

55:26.480 --> 55:28.800
you hear like a freeway and a train and stuff like that.

55:28.800 --> 55:29.880
And they're like trying to harmonize.

55:29.880 --> 55:31.920
But then, then there's a part of the song

55:31.920 --> 55:32.960
that I wanted you to hear.

55:32.960 --> 55:33.920
Ah, let's see what it is.

55:33.920 --> 55:54.560
That's the name of the hotel.

55:54.560 --> 56:13.520
I'm like, did they just say, that's the name.

56:13.520 --> 56:16.440
So beautiful, so beautiful.

56:16.440 --> 56:19.840
Couldn't help but notice an advertisement in there

56:19.840 --> 56:22.360
for the hotel we're staying at.

56:22.360 --> 56:25.000
And they said, oh, well, that's the part of the song

56:25.000 --> 56:28.800
where you talk about the place where we met.

56:28.800 --> 56:31.640
I don't know, they explained it in a way that made me go,

56:31.640 --> 56:34.520
oh, once again, I'm the asshole.

56:34.520 --> 56:35.960
It's not integrated marketing.

56:35.960 --> 56:41.560
It's just like, it's them allowing the first-world way

56:41.560 --> 56:45.000
of things to be incorporated into how they've always

56:45.000 --> 56:46.400
done stuff.

56:46.400 --> 56:47.720
Did they give you like a name?

56:47.720 --> 56:51.000
Did they give you like a special name for like your?

56:51.000 --> 56:52.080
They made me the chief.

56:52.080 --> 56:54.400
They said I was the chief.

56:54.400 --> 56:56.360
Before we started doing Kava, you have to,

56:56.360 --> 57:00.200
because we're the new tribe coming in to be like,

57:00.200 --> 57:02.560
the Kava ceremonies, it's like they welcome you

57:02.560 --> 57:05.960
into their village.

57:05.960 --> 57:08.200
And you have to have a chief.

57:08.200 --> 57:13.080
And they, to start the, they drink, it's one for one.

57:13.080 --> 57:16.400
So someone, their chief drinks, then your chief drinks,

57:16.400 --> 57:18.480
and then back and forth between all of them.

57:18.480 --> 57:19.920
And then their chief's assistant drinks,

57:19.920 --> 57:21.320
then Steve Levy drinks.

57:21.320 --> 57:22.120
Yeah.

57:22.120 --> 57:23.680
Oh, and they love Big Bang Theory.

57:23.680 --> 57:26.880
They fucking love it.

57:26.880 --> 57:29.720
They brought up television, and I was just like,

57:29.720 --> 57:31.280
I just sat and listened for a little bit.

57:31.280 --> 57:34.040
And they're like, yeah, we like, I don't know.

57:34.040 --> 57:35.280
Because they're playing music.

57:35.280 --> 57:38.520
They play some, they play like, you guys like Marvin Gaye.

57:38.520 --> 57:40.720
Like, here's how far they are.

57:40.720 --> 57:43.120
It's like, like, we told them we're from Los Angeles,

57:43.120 --> 57:47.560
and they're like, oh, Elvis, like Elvis, Casino's.

57:47.560 --> 57:48.840
And they're like, no, that's Las Vegas.

57:48.840 --> 57:51.520
But it's like, it's kind of neat perspective.

57:51.520 --> 57:53.880
Or you're like, oh, yeah, it's just like, yeah, the word is.

57:53.880 --> 57:57.400
And it's like, Elvis isn't not from Los Angeles.

57:57.400 --> 58:00.520
But anyways, but they were like, just talking about stuff.

58:00.520 --> 58:02.080
Because it's like, they all have iPhones.

58:02.080 --> 58:03.720
There was one dude who never got off his iPhone.

58:03.720 --> 58:04.360
He's a teenager.

58:04.360 --> 58:06.760
He's probably like, like, hitting on somebody,

58:06.760 --> 58:09.440
or like, he's caught up in his stuff.

58:09.440 --> 58:13.160
But the, and so they're like, talking about like, the TV

58:13.160 --> 58:14.600
shows that they watch, and what we watch,

58:14.600 --> 58:15.080
and all this stuff.

58:15.080 --> 58:16.880
And then I was like, you guys like Big Bang Theory.

58:16.880 --> 58:20.640
And I was like, I can room lit up like, what are they laughing

58:20.640 --> 58:21.640
at on that show?

58:21.640 --> 58:23.640
What are they?

58:23.640 --> 58:27.520
That was the last straw.

58:27.520 --> 58:30.880
Chuck Lorre is a black sorcerer.

58:30.880 --> 58:34.240
If Fijian people love that show, I'm just, I quit.

58:34.240 --> 58:35.920
I'm not saying because it doesn't deserve it.

58:35.920 --> 58:37.680
I'm saying like, I don't understand.

58:37.680 --> 58:39.800
Like, he's just a magician.

58:39.800 --> 58:43.200
He just like, cast a magic spell on the planet.

58:43.200 --> 58:46.400
They're watching Big Bang Theory and Fiji right now.

58:46.400 --> 58:49.840
Fuck, fuck you.

58:49.840 --> 58:51.120
I could have been retired.

58:51.120 --> 58:54.160
Like, I promise if I hit that chat bar,

58:54.160 --> 58:55.360
you won't hear from me anymore.

58:55.360 --> 58:56.120
I'll go away.

58:56.120 --> 58:59.120
I promise.

58:59.120 --> 59:01.000
God damn it.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.840
There's no Lorre town.

59:02.840 --> 59:05.680
Fijian television was weird.

59:05.680 --> 59:06.320
What's that?

59:06.320 --> 59:08.080
Fijian television was strange.

59:08.080 --> 59:11.080
We fell in love with one particular channel.

59:11.080 --> 59:12.440
The Pyramot channel.

59:12.440 --> 59:15.280
But before we left the house, this is the saddest fucking thing.

59:15.280 --> 59:20.240
And as I often ask you, and which you never really

59:20.240 --> 59:24.160
do me the honor of, but whatever, we're stuck together.

59:24.160 --> 59:26.760
But I always say, will you please value my candor?

59:26.760 --> 59:28.120
I'm confessing something to you.

59:28.120 --> 59:32.080
I could whitewash myself like in my stories.

59:32.080 --> 59:32.800
But I don't.

59:32.800 --> 59:35.800
I tell you guys the monster I am.

59:35.800 --> 59:37.360
And you still boo me.

59:37.360 --> 59:40.320
But everybody left but me.

59:40.320 --> 59:41.800
I was the last person in the doorway.

59:41.800 --> 59:43.320
You guys were all going in the car.

59:43.320 --> 59:47.360
It's just high on this mud water and this cheap beer

59:47.360 --> 59:48.840
and just on life.

59:48.840 --> 59:50.400
And probably Cody brought her vape pen.

59:50.400 --> 59:54.320
And everyone's teetering into the car.

59:54.320 --> 59:58.400
And by the way, these guys never asked for a dollar.

59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.320
There was never even any like, oh, let's

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.840
take a Polaroid together at the top of the Kava ceremony.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.320
And then on the way out, there's a rack of them.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.360
And they're like, would you like one?

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.640
It's $80.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.280
There was never any angle with the possible exception

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:14.760
of they like Kava and we bought them a bunch.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:15.720
There was no angle.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.040
There was no capitalism to it.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.320
But that's a different matter.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.440
But everybody else gets leaves.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.360
And I'm in the doorway.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.080
And the only person left is the elder who's

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.920
like 25 of the village, the guy who administered everything

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.600
and who did all of the talking.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.000
He was like the lead singer of PM Don.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.960
He had like a very like just radiant kind of like soft

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.840
but firm like kind of like spiritual power to him

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.720
and a big bowl of mud water in front of him.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.520
And he just like he'd lock eyes with me and just explain things

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.680
and go like, what you're about to drink?

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.400
It's called the Kava root.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.360
Kava root, as I say, the Fijian people.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.680
We cannot escape this.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.680
This is who we are.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.000
We must drink this.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.200
Now you will drink it.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.240
We will be family now.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:05.440
And all that kind of style is really cool.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.840
But at the same get up, and it's just

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.400
him sitting across like on the floor in front

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.440
of his bowl of magic water and everybody else

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.000
to get in the car.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.080
And I turn, and I go to the door, and I go,

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:19.080
I made a show called Community.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.560
No!

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.760
No!

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.560
Indy, start the plane!

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.640
Start the plane, Indy!

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.400
And he goes, what?

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.400
And I made a show called Community.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.400
It's not as popular as Big Bang Theory.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.400
If you have Hulu or something.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.400
This is Joel McKayles at Community College.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.400
And I just thought, I mean, I made some other stuff.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.400
Taylor's a Rick and Morty.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:02.400
And he's like, I'll check it out.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.400
Bula, Bula, indeed.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.400
I was not put on this earth to inspire people

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.400
with my fucking wisdom or my...

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.400
I admire your complete bravery in admitting that.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.400
That's fucking, that's great.

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.400
And you know why I did it.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.400
On the off chance that he would have been like,

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.400
The John Wilder!

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.400
You know.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.400
It's a reference to Romancing the Stone.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.400
They go to a thing.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.400
You want to meet my little mule?

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.400
Oh, I'd have to take my little mule.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.400
So, wait, where was I?

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.400
Left of what the fuck?

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.400
Paramount Channel.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.400
Paramount Channel shows all of Paramount's...

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.400
It's the offshore account of the Paramount network.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.400
It's like their fault of their worst movies.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.400
How do we still make money off of these things

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.400
we lost so much money on?

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.400
There was a movie playing called Turbulence

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.400
with Ray Liotta and Joe...

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.400
Who was it?

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.400
The woman from Dumb and Dumber?

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.400
Yeah.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.400
John Wilder.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.400
Yeah, Turbulence, check this movie out.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.400
I thought it was like fucking insanity.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.400
Speaking of which, has anyone seen the accountant

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.400
with Ben Affleck?

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.400
What in the fucking...

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.400
What in the...

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.400
Trying to take an end run around the Batman franchise?

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.400
By saying he's autistic?

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.400
You gotta watch that movie.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.400
It goes up with one of those...

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:54.400
Like, what's the one where...

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.400
Ghost World...

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.400
Johansson, she's a space lady

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.400
because she took the wrong kind of drug, Lucy.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.400
She...

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.400
And Morgan Freeman keeps narrating

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.400
the amount of brain she's using.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.400
At 3%, you could make people float.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.400
And then she just makes them float.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.400
And I don't know, where are the steaks

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.400
going to happen? And they never do.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.400
Never any steaks.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.400
There's steaks in the first eight minutes of that movie,

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.400
and the rest is her just going like,

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.400
now I can make you have bat wings.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.400
And nope, now I'm a computer.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.400
Think about it.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.400
Peace.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.400
But that movie...

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.400
The accountant is a lot like that.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.400
And John Lithgow's in it and never disappoints.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.400
Never.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.400
Was that your Lithgow?

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.400
That's my Lithgow.

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.400
That's my Lithgow impression.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:54.400
You have to keep your mouth a circle.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.400
If you want to talk like Lithgow,

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.400
you have to keep your mouth a circle.

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:04.400
Like a lamprey.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:09.400
Harry, get back over with the Henderson's.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.400
And John Lithgow.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.400
It's impeccable.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:18.400
There's a little bit of Jimmy Stewart going on in it.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:23.400
Harry, put those Christmas trees back on the law on the tree.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:27.400
Now you're doing Don Knotts.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.400
You went Barney Fife.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:33.400
Andy, it is a wonderful life.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:39.400
I did not have relations with that woman.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.400
It's Don Knotts Bill Clinton.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.400
It goes with that, right?

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.400
And it's a Popeye...

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:51.400
I don't know.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.400
For those of you who are wondering,

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.400
Dan, how do you do all those impressions?

01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:01.400
I have little tricks.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.400
Little secrets.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.400
Does anybody have a book on them or a magazine?

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.400
Like anything with text?

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.400
You do?

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.400
Can I see it?

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.400
The Party Game is the most terrifying Party Game of all time.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.400
Well, you pass it around in a circle.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.400
And so I'll pass it to Dan first.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.400
And what I do is...

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.400
I'll give it to Dan.

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:25.400
Dan, you pick two sentences.

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.400
Anywhere in the book.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.400
You pick two sentences.

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.400
This book is a hurt talk.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.400
I'm a hurt talk.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.400
That'll be good.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.400
You pick two or three sentences.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.400
And then when Dan has selected his sentences,

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.400
then I give him an impression to do.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:47.400
He has to read those sentences as that person.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.400
And you don't try to make him impossible.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.400
Try to do one that's possibly impressionable

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.400
or impersonatable.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.400
So when Dan, you're ready.

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.400
Or just do hurt talk.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.400
Too easy, too easy.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.400
I mean, we could do it.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.400
You want to start as hurt talk, Dan?

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.400
My hurt talk is like, it really comes and goes.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.400
I'll give you...

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.400
Some accidents that occur...

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.400
No, you're doing Highlander.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.400
That's Ren from Ren and Stimpy.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.400
You're doing Christopher Lambert from Highlander.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.400
Peter Lorrie, Christopher Lambert,

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.400
and Ren from Ren and Stimpy.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.400
Yes, Stimpy.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.400
There can be only one.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.400
There can be only one, Stimpy.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.400
Rick, you have to hide these documents.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.400
There can be only one.

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.400
You despise me, don't you, Stimpy?

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.400
You have to hide me, Rick.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.400
You have to hide me, Stimpy.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.400
You have to hide me, Stimpy.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.400
I guess that's not really...

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.400
I'm sure they were going for Peter Lorrie

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.400
with Ren and Stimpy, but Christopher Lambert

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.400
is listening right now and going,

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.400
What the fuck?

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.400
I don't think so.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.400
I am fast being sucked into the hideous vortex.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.400
All right, do you have your sentences?

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.400
Yeah, sure.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.400
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.400
Okay, John Wayne.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.400
Naturally, there are some things

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.400
that I have to take responsibility for.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.400
During the filming of the scene

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:21.400
of the boat moving through the rapids.

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.400
All right, that's it.

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.400
That's two sentences. You did it. You got it.

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.400
Now, you get to pass the book to Spencer

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.400
or to leave it, whatever direction you want to go.

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.400
Spencer, you want to play this game?

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.400
I don't know people, but I'll try it.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.400
Dan's job is now because Dan did it.

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:39.400
Dan gets to pick your impression once you've found your sentences.

01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.400
Oh, God.

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.400
But you try to throw them a lot.

01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.400
Yeah, I'm kind of bad at this,

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:47.400
but all right.

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:49.400
It doesn't have to be a lot.

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:51.400
Something that you feel like is, at least in the wheelhouse,

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.400
at least he knows who that person is.

01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.400
Could be a famous president

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.400
or an actress or an actor

01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.400
or a cartoon character voice.

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.400
You do you think you could do

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.400
Donald Trump?

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:05.400
Not really.

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:07.400
I mean, I'll try, but no.

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.400
The whole point of this game

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.400
is it's fucking terrifying.

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.400
Yeah, it's really terrifying.

01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:15.400
Well, I get that part. That part is very clear.

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.400
For a time in West...

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:19.400
That sounds like Christopher Walken.

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:23.400
For a time in West Germany

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.400
and probably the most subsidized

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.400
film industry in Europe.

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.400
Not the world.

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:31.400
But I gotta tell you, it was never easy

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.400
that way to make films in Germany.

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.400
See, bad.

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.400
That's good.

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.400
It's not about being good.

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:41.400
It's about getting it done.

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:43.400
Can I play a video?

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:45.400
I specifically recorded it

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.400
because I was watching Mr. Ed with Cody for...

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:49.400
Oh, my God.

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.400
By the way, the pilot of Mr. Ed

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:53.400
is the goddamn funniest pilot

01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.400
on TV has played.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.400
I think Mr. Ed is Spencer,

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.400
kind of like...

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.400
I don't know if you'll be able to hear it.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.400
He's throwing shoes

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.400
in a wastebasket, human shoes.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:17.400
What are you doing? No. What is going on here?

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.400
People pitch horseshoes.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.400
I just polished these.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.400
Sorry, Wilbur.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.400
We're just killing time until you got here

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:27.400
for our chess game.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.400
Maybe a little later, Ed.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.400
I've got a lot of things on my mind right now.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:41.400
Okay.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.400
Wait, so...

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.400
I'm so glad you guys coincidentally got quiet

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.400
just in time for that, because it was the okay

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.400
where I was getting out the camera.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.400
So we found out that Christopher Lambert,

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.400
Peter Laurie Wren from Wren & Stimby,

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.400
it's Spencer, Mr. Ed, Johnny Cash.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.400
Johnny Cash!

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.400
Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.400
Wilbur.

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.400
Did you watch Horst or Not?

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.400
Yeah.

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.400
Oh, god damn it, that's an episode.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.400
Ed goes to space.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.400
He joins...

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.400
I have no spoilers.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.400
He joins the space program.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.400
And there's a shot of him

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.400
in a horse astronaut costume.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.400
But that's not all Mr. Ed is.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.400
Mr. Ed's genius is in that it's actually...

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.400
when Mr. Ed shines,

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.400
it's when it's working around

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.400
the fact that it's a sitcom about a talking horse,

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.400
to present you with just kind of funny...

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.400
it's like, you know,

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.400
it's just some good comedy writing on that show.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.400
Good little couplets.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.400
And the pilot, they buy a new house,

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:41.400
Wilbur and his wife is a name I forget,

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.400
and there's a horse here.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.400
Oh, let's keep him, honey, I've always wanted a horse.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.400
Oh, no, we can't afford it.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.400
No, let's keep the horse.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.400
And you can see Wilbur in the foreground

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.400
and he's brushing Ed's kind of rear end

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.400
and Ed's in the background.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.400
Ah, I've always wanted a horse.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.400
It's been a long time since I had a horse.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.400
It's been a long time.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.400
I was just a little boy, and in the background

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.400
it's been a long time since I was a pony.

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.400
But you don't see the...

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.400
Wilbur does kind of like a near-camera take

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.400
and he looks and is like,

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.400
no, no, no, no, no, that can't be.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.400
Wait.

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.400
It must have been somebody.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.400
He says like, wait,

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.400
you didn't just talk.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.400
He was like,

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.400
say something, like what?

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.400
Anything.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.400
Yeah.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.400
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.400
But right before that,

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.400
he goes like, he goes like,

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.400
you didn't just talk, did you?

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.400
And then he goes like,

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.400
did you?

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.400
Yeah, for the truth,

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.400
he goes, say something,

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.400
like what? Anything.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.400
Yeah.

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:51.400
Yeah, what's the...

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.400
It's a weird show because it like

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.400
neither ignores,

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.400
and it was on for 11 years.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.400
Was it really? No.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.400
There's only two seasons on Apple TV,

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:03.400
but maybe they

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.400
took 10 years off between seasons

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.400
and were like, what the fuck are we doing?

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.400
I own the full

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.400
discology of that. I have all of the Mr. Eds.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.400
They're really good.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.400
There's absolutely never any explanation

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.400
for why he talks in the pilot

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.400
five minutes in when he...

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.400
Their first conversation ends with him saying,

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.400
but how?

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.400
How is it possible? I don't know.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.400
Don't question it, Wilbur.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.400
It's bigger than

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.400
the both of us.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.400
Also, the thing is, he only talks

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.400
to Wilbur, which makes him look like a schizophrenic.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.400
Yeah.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.400
And then he goes like, why won't you talk to the bosses?

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.400
I don't know. I never trusted anybody else.

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:45.400
Yeah, because he's nice to him.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.400
Yeah. But boy,

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.400
go there looking

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.400
to refill your feminism tank.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:53.400
No.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.400
That's a kept woman.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:57.400
She's got no qualms

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.400
about it.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.400
The B stories are about her

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.400
trying to trick him into buying her a TV

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.400
and it's just kind of like...

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.400
She's just all...

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.400
Maybe if I spray enough perfume and stuff.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.400
What a terrible bunch of people those people were.

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.400
Good thing

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:17.400
we got rid of that.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.400
Good thing the ladies are all

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.400
up to snuff now. They're all

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.400
the glass ceilings shattered.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.400
Uh...

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.400
You think in this day and age

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.400
there could be a show about a woman

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.400
and a horse? A woman and a talking horse?

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.400
The answer is no.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.400
Everybody would be like, what the fuck?

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:43.400
The next white shaft?

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.400
So sick of this shit.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.400
Sick of this shit.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.400
When's it going to stop?

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:51.400
When are you going to stop ruining my life?

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.400
I fucking love white shit.

01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.400
You're killing me here, man.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.400
It's everywhere.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.400
What? Is the flash going to be

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.400
in a wheelchair?

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.400
It's not the point

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.400
of the flash, man.

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.400
It's important shit.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:13.400
I'm so white.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.400
I love being white.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.400
I'm really proud of my race

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.400
because that's how you can tell

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.400
someone's accomplished something.

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.400
Is when they get all the way

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.400
down to racial pride.

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:27.400
That's when you know

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.400
that's like the guy at the horse track

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.400
that keeps the tickets

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.400
instead of ripping them up because he's like,

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:37.400
we'll always remember this day.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:43.400
What are we learning about the master race?

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.400
Whenever it gets into action,

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.400
I'm just not buying it.

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.400
Really dumb shit happens

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.400
when these superior white people

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.400
get to do whatever they want.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.400
They start doing really dumb shit

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.400
and they can't spell and they're not funny.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:01.400
They have no comedians,

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.400
no singers. You know what my problem is

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:05.400
with white supremacists?

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.400
Where's the jokes?

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.400
For real.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.400
Where's the material?

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.400
When I'm racist, it's fucking hilarious.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.400
I've said this already.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.400
I'm just like, how come when

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.400
your brick gets thrown through a window,

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.400
you know, it's like the note

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.400
is just so hack. It's like,

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.400
go back to Africa or whatever.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:27.400
I'm not from...

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.400
I'm Indian.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.400
I'm like, what?

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.400
What?

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.400
I'm not saying it would excuse it,

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.400
but if you're in a zone

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.400
where you're throwing a brick through a window,

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.400
we're writing something nasty

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.400
on cashiers,

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.400
those things that end up on Facebook.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.400
Look what this person wrote and they didn't leave a tip.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.400
They're never funny.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.400
They're never inventive.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.400
What are you releasing?

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.400
Why aren't you full of glee?

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.400
Why aren't you suddenly so excited?

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.400
Why don't you make something to this Asian person

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.400
that I could never ever say at work?

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.400
I'm going to make it just dumb and boring.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.400
Like, you're Asian.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.400
Get out.

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.400
And then they don't smile afterwards.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.400
They don't go, oh, God, I love that.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.400
They just go like...

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.400
Are you going to die?

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.400
You're going to die of racist expression.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.400
You're going to be making you more

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.400
fucking angry.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.400
Just say shit that will make you happy.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:25.400
Say...

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.400
I'm not saying you have to be a good person.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.400
Why don't you just say what's on your mind

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.400
that you want to say that would make you

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.400
less angry.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.400
Like, you know, maybe you want to kiss a black person.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.400
Maybe you should say that.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.400
I want to throw a brick through the window

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.400
and it just says, I want to kiss you.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.400
It's still not a good...

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.400
It's still a terrible crime smash.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.400
Oh, my God. Honey, what happened?

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.400
A brick came through the window.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.400
What's the note?

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.400
What does it say?

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.400
Do you like me? Yes or no?

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.400
Yeah.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.400
Circle one. Check this box.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.400
And then you hear tires squealing and,

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.400
sorry!

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:05.400
But then they go home and maybe there's like

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:07.400
eight more of those and they fucking relax.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.400
They are.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:11.400
They just...

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.400
I've never seen a group of people so upset

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:15.400
that they won an election.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.400
They're so mad still.

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.400
And they're still so mad at Hillary Clinton about it.

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.400
It was like, take a break.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.400
You keep saying things like, ha, ha, we won.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:25.400
But you're not relaxing.

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.400
There are no smiles.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.400
Smiles.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.400
Two notes for racists.

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.400
Where's the jokes?

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.400
Smiles, people.

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:37.400
I want to see smiles.

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.400
That's how you win, you know?

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.400
Where's the zazz?

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.400
I'm going to start

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:47.400
a white supremacist party called

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:49.400
the Zazzies.

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.400
It's called Zazz.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.400
I saw an article.

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.400
Bruce Springsteen, you know,

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:57.400
is saying, like,

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.400
good on him.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.400
Because Bruce Springsteen probably

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.400
by default, a totem

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.400
of the rust belt

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.400
and therefore, you know,

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.400
so he's a good liberal.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.400
It says, like, you know, just see,

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.400
fucking liberal.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.400
And, you know, it's still dancing in the dark

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.400
and I'm still on fire.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.400
I still want to know if your daddy's home.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.400
I still got the rag around here

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.400
somewhere.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:27.400
But I'm not happy about a Nazi in the White House.

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.400
And then there's, like,

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.400
the Breitbart article about that.

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.400
It's just, like,

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.400
it's like,

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.400
yeah, well, when's the last time he had a hit?

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.400
When's the last time he had seven sold-out shows

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.400
at the Meadowlands?

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.400
Oh, sorry.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.400
It's just kind of, like,

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:49.400
there's something really satisfying

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.400
about watching

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.400
the right

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.400
every time, like, another

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.400
celebrity, like,

01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:59.400
becomes their pinata.

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:01.400
There's this undertone of, like, who's left?

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:03.400
Like, who are you going to say

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.400
is nailing it out there

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.400
in La La Land if it's not

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.400
the people that are, like, famous for playing,

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.400
like, blue-collar characters

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.400
and stuff, like, they really

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.400
I love that. There's, like,

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.400
I wouldn't have really thought this if there would just be nobody

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.400
who wants to do the inauguration.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.400
I think that's fucking hilarious. That's amazing.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.400
It's, like, one of those things that you'd be like,

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:25.400
yeah, life doesn't really work that way.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.400
You'll find out that ZZ Top is fucking Red Max

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.400
or something, and that they love it,

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.400
like, that they love Trump. Who knows?

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:33.400
Well, Bruce Willis is the fucking Trump supporter.

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:35.400
If he gets ZZ Top, he's got me back on board.

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.400
I fucking love the top.

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:41.400
They're a good band, you guys.

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.400
Have you guys seen this young pope?

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.400
Oh, no, no. Is that on yet?

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:47.400
I was looking for that. I don't know.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.400
I've just seen all the pictures. I don't know why

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.400
you hear young pope

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.400
and, you know, you get a certain image in your head

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.400
and then you see, presumably,

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.400
Jude Law as the young pope

01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.400
and you're like, wait a second.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.400
I thought this was a young pope.

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.400
Like, I was picturing, like, a radical teen

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.400
skateboarding through the Vatican.

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.400
Oh, right.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:09.400
That's a young pope.

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.400
He's wearing his mitre backwards.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.400
Yeah. I checked

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.400
and when I say checked, someone tweeted at me

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.400
that the youngest pope was 16 years old.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.400
What?

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.400
And that's just a pope. We don't call him young pope.

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.400
Yeah, but that was just a pope.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.400
But that was, like, in the 1500s.

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.400
I don't care. I'm just talking.

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.400
Like, in terms of youngness of popes,

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.400
if you want to sell it on the premise of a young pope,

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.400
you got to go younger than Jude Law.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:35.400
That's, like, less old pope.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:37.400
Well, you know what you do.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.400
Right.

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.400
Or just pope.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.400
Yeah, younger than the last pope.

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.400
Yeah.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.400
Not, not, I don't know.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.400
I'm sure he does a great job.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:51.400
It's not what you expect.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.400
I really wanted to see someone with shades,

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.400
like, really skateboarding

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.400
through the Vatican.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.400
Yeah, like, Pope Chad.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.400
Yeah.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.400
Pope Chad the first.

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.400
He's just the antichrist, right?

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:07.400
Is that going to be the thing? He's just the antichrist?

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:09.400
Is that the idea?

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:11.400
Jude Law?

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.400
Yeah, because it kind of seems commercial.

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.400
Like, oh, he's probably the antichrist, maybe?

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.400
Oh, I don't know.

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.400
Maybe I'm dating myself.

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.400
Uh, the, uh, here's the thing.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.400
Here's the thing. I just realized this.

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.400
This is valuable.

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:27.400
Play the theme song for value corner.

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.400
Valuable insight, not information.

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:31.400
Valuable insight in me.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.400
Something I just realized that's really noteworthy

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.400
that, uh, I want to put into the record

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.400
because I think it's fascinating.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.400
Duck is the only animal

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.400
I like to picture while I'm eating.

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.400
I always do it.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.400
Like, when I order,

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.400
when I'm eating ham, I never picture a pig.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.400
Like, I don't want to.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:59.400
Like, hamburgers, I don't want to picture a cow.

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.400
Uh, chicken, no dice.

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.400
Uh, but every time I,

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.400
let's see, like, oh, duck, duck, uh, duck prosciutto.

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:07.400
I'd love that.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.400
And I always picture this mallard flying while I'm eating it.

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.400
I'm like, mm, yum, yum.

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.400
I'm like, oh, I'm going to eat this.

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.400
I'm going to eat this.

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:17.400
I'm going to eat this.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.400
Like, I'm like,

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.400
it's extra delicious

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.400
when I think about his feather-covered breast,

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.400
like, nobly piercing the clouds.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:27.400
Like, why?

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.400
Do you eat duck?

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:31.400
Well, rarely.

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.400
But then when I do, I'm like,

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.400
I'm going to eat a duck.

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:37.400
Like, no, I'm not going to eat duck.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:39.400
I'm going to eat a duck.

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:41.400
Like, maybe I was like, uh,

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:43.400
was I like a, uh,

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:45.400
some kind of very large swamp cat

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.400
in a past life?

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:49.400
You might have been like a,

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.400
like a spaniel.

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.400
Yeah, yeah, like a hunting duck.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.400
I don't feel that way about chicken or cows or anything.

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.400
I don't have like a herding mentality,

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.400
but I really want to fetch a duck.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.400
Do you ever eat goose?

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.400
Yeah, because you're on to something,

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.400
because I don't like the taste.

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.400
It's not like, oh, I can't wait to devour the duck.

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.400
It's like, I can't wait to sink my teeth

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.400
into this flying mallard, you know?

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.400
And maybe bring it to my owner.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:15.400
You might have been a Labrador Retriever.

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.400
That's why I get along with Harvey,

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.400
because he's a part,

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:21.400
neither of those dogs.

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.400
He's a Golden Retriever.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:25.400
He's a, oh yeah, oh Labrador Retriever

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.400
is like half lab, half golden,

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:29.400
or is a Labrador Retriever its own kind of dog.

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:31.400
They're both Retrievers,

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.400
because they retrieve Labradors and, and Golden.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:37.400
The Labrador Retriever does not retrieve Labradors.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:41.400
Yeah, that would crash the simulation.

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.400
There would be like a zero,

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.400
division by zero error.

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.400
Honey, honey, why are there 11 Labradors

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:51.400
on our doorstep?

01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.400
Well, we have a Labrador Retriever.

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.400
Why is the sky purple?

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.400
Someone threw a Labrador

01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:59.400
and had a Golden Retriever

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.400
get it.

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.400
Oh, wow.

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:05.400
Yeah, it's like putting a portable hole

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.400
in it.

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.400
Yeah.

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:13.400
Right, Mr. Ed?

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.400
That's, no, oh, okay.

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:19.400
Is that what he said?

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:21.400
The We Fit Girl

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.400
was the lungfish of a life

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.400
spent on the shores of corporate

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.400
assimilation.

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.400
I was thinking about this today.

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:33.400
Walk me through that one.

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:35.400
Some of you kids too, too, too young

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.400
even to remember this, the We Fit Girl thing.

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.400
Well, too young to really experience it was

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.400
a scandal a little bit.

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:43.400
Remember the We Fit Girl, Steve?

01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.400
I know the, yeah.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.400
I don't pretend, I don't know.

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.400
Cody was on my elliptical today

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.400
and it was like her, her...

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:53.400
Isn't she a character in Smash?

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.400
Yeah, well, that's the thing.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.400
If there's a scandal, that's weird.

01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.400
Well, it wasn't a scandal.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.400
Okay, look.

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:03.400
It was the girl at the ponytail

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.400
and she's in her underwear and a t-shirt

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.400
and she's doing the hula hoop game on the We Fit

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:09.400
and then there's like a guy filming it

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:11.400
and then the camera turns to him and he's like,

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.400
and then it goes back.

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.400
And then it went viral because it was like,

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.400
wow, she's so unintentionally,

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.400
globally catching our attention

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:21.400
with her innocent use of this

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.400
consumer product that happened to launch last week.

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:25.400
And then there was like a little mini scandal

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.400
where it was like they were on the Nintendo

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:29.400
payroll or something, right?

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.400
They didn't know about that.

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.400
Well, maybe that even goes more to my point

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.400
because whatever was scandalous about it,

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.400
I remember there was like just something

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.400
where it was just like, oh, did you know

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:41.400
that they got paid to do that or something like that?

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:43.400
Like, I was explaining that to Cody today

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.400
because she didn't know what the hell I was talking about

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.400
and I was like, and then I stopped halfway through

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.400
because she was like, that doesn't even seem like,

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.400
why would that even be a wrong thing?

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.400
Who cares if Nintendo gave you a bunch of money

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:55.400
and then you successfully staged

01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:57.400
an innocent objectification video

01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:59.400
of your supposed girlfriend or the thing.

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.400
And I was like, yeah, you're right.

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.400
That would be absolutely high-fived now

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:05.400
as just a piece of media that was successful

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:07.400
in a time when it's hard to affect people.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.400
Like, and like,

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.400
I just thought that was noteworthy

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.400
that we were still so innocent like eight years ago

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.400
that we, I remember people being like,

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.400
yeah, but you hear that's fake, that's fake.

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.400
Anyways, all right, fuck you guys.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:23.400
That wasn't the same segment.

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.400
You just, you put

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:27.400
parentheses around it.

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.400
That wasn't part of the duck thing.

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.400
I don't, I don't want that dragging

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.400
the duck thing down.

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.400
That was R&D.

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:37.400
That was like, that was like workshopping.

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.400
That's not even going to air on the West Coast.

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.400
You mayor, you mayor

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:43.400
all, all control.

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:47.400
He's got a point.

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:49.400
Fair enough.

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:57.400
Okay, so...

01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:01.400
It's the best music of all time.

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.400
They speak three languages in Fijian.

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.400
By default.

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:07.400
The English Fijian, and Fijian has like 19 dialects

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.400
but also they have to speak like,

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:11.400
I can't even remember, should have written it down, but...

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.400
French maybe? No, no, it's not French Polynesia.

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.400
What is it? Is it French?

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.400
That's probably, yeah, I'm sure it's French.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:19.400
But here's the crazy thing.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.400
The kids, when they go to school,

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.400
English is compulsory.

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:25.400
Fijian isn't.

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.400
Yeah, I don't think it's French.

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:29.400
That's not French Polynesia Fiji, is it?

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.400
No.

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.400
People are saying German in the front row.

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.400
Well, Steve, do you know?

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.400
Maybe one of the Indian...

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:39.400
Oh, Hindi.

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:41.400
It's probably Hindi.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.400
They probably have to speak Hindi.

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.400
There's a huge Indian population

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.400
but they're descended from

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.400
like five generations ago.

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.400
They brought...

01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:53.400
I don't know who...

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:55.400
I have giant gaps in my...

01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:57.400
I'm not a provider of this information.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:59.400
But Indian people were brought there

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.400
or came there to work the sugar cane fields.

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.400
And then...

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.400
Could it have been slavery?

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:07.400
I don't know because part of the story is that

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.400
then they could go back.

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:11.400
And then a lot of them...

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.400
Maybe it was a really bad time in India.

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.400
And then a lot of them could go back.

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:17.400
But then there's just descendants there

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.400
of people who are like, are you fucking kidding me?

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.400
I'm not leaving Fiji.

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:23.400
And they have this really

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.400
positive attitude about multiculturalism there.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:27.400
They have this military regime

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:29.400
that I don't know anything about

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:31.400
because they don't want to throw shade on it

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.400
because they're so nice.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.400
But they have this tribe of...

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.400
They have these provinces

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.400
and then each province is headed up by an elder.

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:41.400
Because it's just old school stuff.

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.400
And they don't have any power

01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:45.400
in the sense that

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.400
there's no contract.

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:49.400
But if you were to defy them,

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.400
they're like the greybeards

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:53.400
in Skyrim.

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.400
Alright.

01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:57.400
You didn't talk...

01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:59.400
But they...

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:01.400
You didn't mention how

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:03.400
when we got in the car,

01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:05.400
one of the first things the guy said

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.400
when we got there was he was talking about

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.400
disrespecting local Fijians.

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.400
He was talking about a missionary that got

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.400
eaten there because he rubbed their head or something.

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.400
That's just...

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:17.400
What is that?

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.400
I rubbed his head.

01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.400
He didn't eat me.

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.400
I don't know how much of South Pacific

01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.400
islands the thing is

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.400
when I was in Tahiti, the third sun thing?

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:29.400
You know about that?

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:31.400
Yeah, but wait, hold on, because that's rich.

01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:33.400
Rich is the third sun.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.400
You know rich?

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:37.400
That's worth talking about.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.400
I want you to talk about that

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.400
because you were telling us about that in Australia.

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.400
I thought that was really fascinating.

01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.400
But the elders,

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:47.400
when the refugee crisis happened,

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.400
or it was actually a previous refugee crisis,

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.400
not the current Syrian one,

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:53.400
but it was something similar.

01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.400
There's a bunch of people that needed homes,

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.400
and the elders

01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:59.400
gave a bunch of Fijian land

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:01.400
to any refugees that wanted to come to Fiji.

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.400
Who doesn't want to go to Fiji?

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.400
But it's only on the condition

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:07.400
of the land.

01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.400
It's theirs to live on and do as they please

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.400
and reproduce on and work until

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.400
the day they die and their children do whatever.

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:15.400
But it's just like, they can't sell it.

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:19.400
They're fucking ecstatic.

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.400
They have a thriving

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:23.400
section of people there

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.400
that were descended from refugees.

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.400
I think it was Afghanistan

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.400
and it was the Middle East.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.400
Bad things don't automatically happen to you

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.400
just because you're like,

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.400
hey, if you want to use my pool,

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.400
you know?

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.400
Nobody's going to go,

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.400
you sooner could use it and take a shit.

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.400
It's the worst part of you

01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.400
that assumes that about them.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.400
Talk about your Tahitian...

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:49.400
I will get this wrong.

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:51.400
Does anybody know more about this than I do?

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.400
There's a thing called...

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.400
I forget the word for it in Samoan or Tahitian,

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:57.400
but I will get all this wrong,

01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:59.400
so please send your letters to Steve Levy

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:03.400
at stevelevy.hotmailballworship.com.

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.400
There are a bunch of guys

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.400
on the island there

01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.400
that are as big as every other guy

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.400
and they're raised as women, I believe,

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.400
and I think it's a third son thing.

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:21.400
If you're the third son, you are raised as a woman.

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.400
It's like a place of honor.

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:25.400
I think it's different throughout the islands.

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:27.400
There's a huge...

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.400
Transvestite culture.

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.400
They're regarded as

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.400
not divine, but special.

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:35.400
I believe there's a part of it

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:37.400
where if you're the third son,

01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:39.400
you're raised to be another woman in the house.

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:41.400
And they're treated with huge respect.

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.400
They'll just be this giant

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.400
Pacific Islander guy

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:47.400
walking by you,

01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.400
or he or she.

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:51.400
I don't know how it works,

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.400
but they have makeup on

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.400
and they dance the woman parts

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:57.400
and they do the female

01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:59.400
work in the household.

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.400
I know I'm fucking all this up.

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.400
I have not done any research on it,

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:05.400
but that's the bits and pieces that I thought I picked up.

01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:07.400
We went across the island

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.400
from the resort to where the locals hung out

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.400
on Sunday, which is their day off,

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.400
and it was all of them...

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.400
So this woman or

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.400
man or whatever,

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:19.400
Tupu or Topu,

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.400
my height or taller,

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.400
who was the bartender, and she was hilarious.

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:25.400
She's like, oh, you want to dance with me?

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:27.400
She'll come over. It's terrifying,

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:29.400
because I could fit inside

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:31.400
her like a costume.

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:33.400
But they're all just

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.400
all hanging out and there's no

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:37.400
separation between trans culture

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.400
or straight or gay.

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:41.400
They're all just one group.

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:43.400
It seemed like there was a liberal amount

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.400
of...

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.400
I think that waiter's gay.

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.400
We did have conversations

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.400
about...

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.400
Oh, was that person

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:55.400
trans maybe?

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:57.400
What did they think about that?

01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:59.400
We didn't want to

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.400
be guests from the first world

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:03.400
in these people's living room.

01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:05.400
It wasn't like,

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:07.400
let's turn over every corner and every stone

01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:09.400
and talk a little bit about politics,

01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.400
but never heard

01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:13.400
anything that indicated

01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:15.400
homophobia or transphobia or anything like that.

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.400
I wouldn't be shocked if

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:19.400
equatorial and island cultures

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:21.400
were a little more comfortable with that

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.400
for a long time coming, because

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:25.400
well, then I'd say

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:27.400
a bunch of shit that would make me some weird Archie Bunker

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.400
and throw splaining to

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.400
some shit that would get me in hot water.

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:33.400
But I suffice

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:35.400
it to say, I would just assume it's like

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:37.400
the more nomadic, like we got

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:39.400
to kill a mammoth or we're going to die

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:41.400
and like, oh, these people invented math,

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:43.400
so now let's just move in. Thanks for the math.

01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:47.400
Those people had male gods

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:49.400
according to what I learned from Campbell

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:51.400
and the equatorial civilizations had

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:53.400
female gods and they were like

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.400
oh, you know,

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.400
God's a woman and a moon and a

01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:59.400
tide and here's math

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:01.400
and here's algebra and here's all this shit and then

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.400
the dudes come down and they go like,

01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:05.400
we know how to make spears sharp

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.400
but not that they weren't

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:09.400
brutal in those agricultural cultures,

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:11.400
but because you live by your plants

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:13.400
and you're growing out of the ground and then you eat them,

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.400
there's probably

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.400
a little less incentive

01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:19.400
from going back

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:21.400
50,000 years for like, oh,

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.400
that guy throws like a girl, you know, like

01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.400
fuck him, like there's something wrong

01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:27.400
with him, like there's probably a little more capacity

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.400
for like, oh,

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:31.400
like who cares, like maybe you're good at math

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:33.400
or what, I don't fucking know,

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.400
just sue me tomorrow.

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:37.400
I just said a little fast skimming.

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.400
But you also told me, no, they hate it, they'll cut off your head

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.400
if you pretend, you know, I would be like,

01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:43.400
I'm not surprised because I'm so smart.

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.400
I'm just fucking idiot.

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:47.400
I fucking hate myself. I'm going to kill myself right now.

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.400
No, no.

01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:53.400
Boys and girls,

01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.400
if you clap loud enough, he'll kill himself.

01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:01.400
We have two, we have two,

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:03.400
we have official two pieces of business.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.400
Real quick, let me interrupt you.

01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:07.400
I just doing a bit of skimming.

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.400
I might have misunderstood a lot of that.

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.400
There's also a thing in Samoa called third gender

01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:13.400
where there's a whole bunch of...

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.400
What? No, no, no.

01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:21.400
Not in my town.

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.400
So I want to do more research on that.

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:27.400
I think I missed a lot of the information on that one.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.400
Human beings are a motorcycle.

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:31.400
The front wheels are dick and balls.

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:33.400
And the back wheels are pussy.

01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:35.400
You add a third wheel

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:37.400
and it doesn't tip over, but...

01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:39.400
It's more stable.

01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.400
Who wants that?

01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.400
If you're in a chase, you can't go through a tunnel.

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.400
I don't want to hear it.

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.400
I don't want to hear it.

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:51.400
No, you have to make me go to the bathroom in my world.

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.400
Black bathroom, I don't know.

01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:55.400
White bathroom.

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:57.400
What's next?

01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.400
Is the Hulk going to be purple?

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:01.400
It's a domino effect.

01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:03.400
Coming to get me.

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:05.400
There's no more white people tomorrow.

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.400
I'm going to wake up and all white people are going to be gone.

01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.400
All white people are going to be gone.

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.400
Where do the white people go?

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:15.400
I'm the one that should be worried about that.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.400
My audience is all white.

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:19.400
I don't give a fuck.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.400
Who gives a shit?

01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:23.400
I'm sorry.

01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:25.400
If you're listening to this on your ham radio

01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.400
in your Nazi bunker,

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:29.400
sharpening the teeth

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:31.400
on the bottom of your boots,

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:33.400
waiting for inauguration day

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.400
to come into my home

01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:37.400
and just have your way with my dog

01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:39.400
and drink all my soylent

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:41.400
and set fire

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:43.400
to my earthquake kits

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:45.400
and throw my safety pins in the garbage.

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:47.400
I'll give you

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:49.400
all the last reason

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:51.400
you need to do that.

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.400
I'll give you the big quote.

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.400
Who the fuck cares

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:57.400
about white people?

01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:59.400
What if you woke up

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:01.400
tomorrow and they were all gone?

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:03.400
What is the end game?

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:05.400
What is the end game?

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:07.400
Is it supposed to get to the moon

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.400
and it's all white people?

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:11.400
I wasn't going to say anything,

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.400
but what was with Leon's hair?

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:17.400
It was weird.

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:19.400
I know, it's so is yours,

01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:21.400
but hey, I'm from the Bronx.

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:23.400
We would just start to fucking what?

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:25.400
I'm fucking dumb.

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:27.400
Who cares about your race?

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:29.400
What is the fucking white?

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.400
Why? What is the worst nightmare?

01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:33.400
Tiger Woods?

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.400
He could hit the ball farther.

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:37.400
I'm not saying that automatically

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.400
we'd be stronger,

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.400
but I...

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:45.400
I don't think...

01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.400
I just don't see the nightmare.

01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:51.400
I try to get inside the head

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.400
of the enemy, you know, so I can try to like,

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.400
you know, and it's just like, I don't...

01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:57.400
It ends at like this gate where it's like,

01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.400
they don't think past that gate.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:01.400
They're just like, well, it's...

01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:03.400
They're sleeping with our women,

01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:05.400
which is, I mean, it's a disgusting thought,

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:07.400
but that's where it comes from.

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:09.400
And then they're probably sexually frustrated

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:11.400
people who are like, this is me

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.400
that's not getting slept with,

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.400
and you know, they can't admit that obviously,

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:17.400
so it just fuels this crazy anger.

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:19.400
Yeah.

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:21.400
I mean, my pornography is all a bunch of white women,

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:23.400
like, so I guess like,

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.400
there's something deep-seated like,

01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:27.400
you know, I want to like fuck a white woman,

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:29.400
so I guess if you're living somewhere,

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.400
I guess if you ask a girl out

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:33.400
and she's like, no, and then she sleeps with a guy

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:35.400
that's darker than you, I guess you're like,

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:37.400
that's it, that tears it.

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:39.400
But wouldn't you just have

01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:41.400
that story and then just be like...

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:43.400
They're bad people, too.

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.400
I mean, it's not like...

01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:47.400
They're bad people, I forgot.

01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.400
All right, so the two items of official business are...

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:51.400
Let's get down to official

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:53.400
Harmontown business.

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:57.400
Order! Order!

01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:59.400
Right, so we have Jane came...

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:01.400
I will clear this comment before I start.

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:05.400
Jane, I think you...

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:07.400
If I gleaned...

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:09.400
I heard through the grapevine, there may be some

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:11.400
official business that you have, right?

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.400
No? Yeah, sure.

01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:15.400
Yeah?

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.400
There's a case in your lap.

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:19.400
Would you like to come up?

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:23.400
Jane, everybody!

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.400
Nice.

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:31.400
That's my music.

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.400
I like it. Yeah.

01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.400
That's the official Jane theme.

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.400
Whoa.

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:39.400
I like your new hair. Is that a new hair thing?

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.400
New hair thing, I love it. Thank you.

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:43.400
So, yeah, so we have...

01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:45.400
Remember back in May,

01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:47.400
I brought a couple of glasses

01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:49.400
for you and for Jeff.

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.400
A glass gate that we had made.

01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:53.400
A glass gate. I still have mine.

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.400
You've still got yours? Yes.

01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:57.400
But Dan's went missing.

01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.400
Well, wait, what's this?

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:01.400
That's a new one. Oh, wait, but...

01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:03.400
What's the case? A couple more.

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:05.400
Okay.

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.400
I thought this was Jeff's when I walked into the room.

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:09.400
Oh, Jeff!

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:11.400
And I was like, oh, that's bigger.

01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:13.400
You thought when I didn't drink out of this,

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:15.400
you thought maybe I was sending you a signal.

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:17.400
And I was like, fuck your glass.

01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:19.400
Use it, man. Use it.

01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:21.400
Fuck your crowdfunded glass.

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.400
Wasn't there controversy about the crowdfunding?

01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:25.400
Oh, yeah.

01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:27.400
So, yeah, we...

01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:29.400
After the first one was gone,

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:31.400
we assumed stolen based on

01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:33.400
the word from backstage.

01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.400
There was a lot of upcry

01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:37.400
online, and we knew that you were disappointed.

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:39.400
We knew that people really enjoyed

01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:41.400
seeing this special rocks glass

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.400
that we'd made.

01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:45.400
So we... And for the listeners

01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:47.400
not watching the video,

01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:49.400
they're kind of a beautiful play

01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:51.400
off of a red solo cup.

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:53.400
Yeah, so they're based on the design of a solo cup.

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:55.400
So I came up with the design for it,

01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.400
and then I worked with a glass maker.

01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:59.400
So I work in Corning,

01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:01.400
and worked with a master glassblower to make glass...

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:03.400
And this is conflict glass, isn't it?

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.400
This is...

01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:07.400
It's made out of sand

01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.400
that...

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:11.400
From Aleppo.

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:13.400
There's a special...

01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:15.400
When a mortar round

01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:17.400
hits sand,

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:19.400
it creates a special glass.

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.400
It just has a little less aftertaste.

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:23.400
There's actually some Trinitite

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:25.400
mixed in there, too. There's some...

01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:27.400
The molten sand from White Sands

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.400
is there from the first nuclear explosion.

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:31.400
No, no, I'm kidding. Sorry.

01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:33.400
I've got bits.

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.400
You got bits? That's good. No.

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:37.400
I know you were interested in glass.

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.400
Yeah, so we did a...

01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.400
We had Indiegogo.

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.400
We raised the money to pay the glassblower

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:45.400
to recreate his work.

01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.400
And in the process, he made the double rocks glass

01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:49.400
for you to make up for yours.

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:51.400
You've already got one, so we didn't make one for you.

01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:53.400
I'm set.

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.400
Can we do a reverse Indiegogo

01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:57.400
where I can just pay everybody back?

01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:59.400
Whoa.

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:01.400
So we actually have a full set of four now.

01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:03.400
Oh, cute.

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:05.400
With a slot for Dan and Jeff.

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:07.400
Also, for the listener,

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:10.400
it's in what looks like a weapons grade gun case.

01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:12.400
Yeah, custom foam inserts.

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.400
So this is actually a request

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:16.400
from Chris and Sarah backstage

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.400
to have something in a Pelican case

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:20.400
that they can then store with the equipment.

01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:22.400
It's a Nick Fury

01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.400
beverage wear case.

01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:27.400
How did you make those custom foam inserts, I want to know?

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.400
Because I've often

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:31.400
looked into getting some custom foam inserts

01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:33.400
made for various briefcases.

01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:35.400
I forgot about the sponsor.

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:37.400
Marcus's custom foam inserts.

01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:42.400
Some from me inserts.

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.400
So many nights, like 2, 3 a.m.

01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:46.400
I'll get a text from Spencer

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:49.400
just haranguing me about foam inserts.

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.400
It's near and dear to my heart, in all honesty.

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:57.400
We can take this offline.

01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:59.400
Have you guys seen this commercial?

01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:01.400
I don't have to watch commercials,

01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.400
but we were in New York,

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:05.400
and so I saw a lot of this catheter cowboy

01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:07.400
that I think I Instagram.

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:09.400
And then there was this guy,

01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:11.400
like the MyPillow guy?

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:13.400
Have you guys know that?

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:15.400
Is that air here?

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:17.400
He's so proud of his pillow.

01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:19.400
Because his product is called MyPillow.

01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:21.400
In his mind, it's a brand name,

01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:23.400
but it's just the words MyPillow.

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:25.400
So all he is is a nine foot

01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:27.400
mustachioed, like kind of

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:29.400
firefighter physique guy

01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:31.400
clutching a pillow to his chest,

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:33.400
just saying, MyPillow is the best pillow

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:35.400
you'll ever have.

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:37.400
He's just talking about

01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:39.400
MyPillow and how great it is.

01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:40.400
And it's adorable.

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:42.400
You're going to love MyPillow.

01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:43.400
If you can get it.

01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:44.400
I designed MyPillow

01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.400
so that my head could...

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.400
I dare you to take MyPillow.

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:50.400
Normal pillows make you lose sleep.

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.400
MyPillow doesn't.

01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:52.400
I wake up in the morning

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:54.400
refreshed all the time.

01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:56.400
Call MyPillow.

01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.400
If you want MyPillow.

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:01.400
Anyways, so Jane, how's it going?

01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:03.400
Jane the person to give us some updates,

01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:06.400
not Jane the glassware provider.

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.400
Right.

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:08.400
The second part.

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:09.400
So I've actually...

01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:11.400
We've been talked on and off

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.400
over the last three years, really.

01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:15.400
I've actually reached a point

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.400
where I have given notice at work

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:20.400
that I'd like my name officially

01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:22.400
on the record to begin to be

01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.400
Dr. Jane Cook.

01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:27.400
So I'm hoping that it will come to pass

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.400
in the next couple of months at work.

01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:33.400
So that'll be officially out there.

01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:35.400
I kind of like that that's the last step.

01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:38.400
Like I said something about you as a person.

01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:41.400
I like the last step being the professional world.

01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:43.400
It really needs to be...

01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:45.400
I built up a reputation over 20 years

01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:47.400
as a scientist.

01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:49.400
And my name was out there on

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:51.400
papers and patents and whatnot.

01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:53.400
So there was also a respect

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:54.400
for the institution.

01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.400
I work at a museum,

01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:59.400
which is a public educational institution.

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:04.400
And my transitioning my gender

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.400
is sort of my thing,

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:07.400
how I present it.

01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:09.400
I don't want the story of that institution

01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:10.400
to be me.

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:11.400
Right.

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:12.400
The story of the institution is glass.

01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:13.400
It's science.

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:14.400
It's art.

01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:15.400
It's history.

01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:17.400
It had to get to a point where

01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:19.400
I was feeling comfortable enough

01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:20.400
with my presentation,

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:22.400
comfortable enough with my safety net,

01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.400
that I was willing to then take

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:26.400
that next step in a way that wouldn't

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:28.400
impact the broader

01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:30.400
world that I was part of.

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:32.400
But one thing that is

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:34.400
important to me, two aspects of this

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:36.400
is I'm not doing like a legal name

01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:38.400
change and I'm not doing a legal

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.400
gender change because fuck it.

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:42.400
I don't need the government's

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.400
permission to say what I am.

01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.400
I don't need the government's permission

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:48.400
to say what my name is.

01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:50.400
Now when you've got a lot of people

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.400
who care about me, who like me to be me.

01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:54.400
When you fill out government documents

01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:56.400
and there's MRF,

01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:58.400
you just stick with what was already

01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:00.400
given just for simplicity's sake?

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.400
Well, I sort of think about

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:04.400
what's the intent of the demographic

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:05.400
information.

01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:07.400
So if I'm going to be flying and there's

01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:09.400
still a whole thing where if I'm going

01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:11.400
to be reading mail, it's probably better

01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:12.400
to put the M down.

01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.400
But if I know they're just collecting

01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:16.400
information about what's the gender of

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:18.400
the people who are buying this couch,

01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:19.400
I'll put female.

01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:21.400
Because I'm a female person on the couch.

01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:23.400
I'm a female person still when I go through

01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:24.400
the corner.

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.400
If you got the couch because it had

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:28.400
cup holders, you'll put male.

01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:29.400
Exactly.

01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:31.400
But if you got it because...

01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:33.400
I like the fabric.

01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:35.400
When you're talking to a trans person,

01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:37.400
you can be totally...

01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:39.400
you can just do all the old 80's

01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:40.400
gender jokes.

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:41.400
Exactly.

01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:42.400
Absolutely.

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.400
His toilet seat...

01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:46.400
Yeah, I don't know about toilets.

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:47.400
It's up and down.

01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:48.400
The directions.

01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:50.400
But I want the toilet paper going around

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:51.400
like this.

01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:57.400
I know how to push this button.

01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:58.400
Yeah, it's good.

01:47:58.400 --> 01:47:59.400
Yeah.

01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:01.400
Yeah, so that's good.

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:03.400
So you gave notice, but do you have any

01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.400
feedback from that?

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:07.400
I'm really lucky to work at a really great

01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:08.400
place that it was...

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:09.400
Congratulations.

01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:10.400
We're behind you.

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:11.400
This is great.

01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:12.400
We're so happy to do this.

01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:13.400
And you had that feeling about them.

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:14.400
They're people of science.

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.400
You worked in this...

01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:16.400
You know these people forever.

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:17.400
And you know that they respected you.

01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:19.400
And I think that's important to stress.

01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:20.400
Like that's a real...

01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:22.400
That's very menchi of you.

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:23.400
The real...

01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:24.400
The reason you...

01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:25.400
Femchi.

01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:26.400
The reason you...

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:27.400
Menchi.

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:29.400
None by menchi.

01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:35.400
Episode title.

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:37.400
You exercised restraint, not out of shame

01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:39.400
and not out of profiteering

01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:42.400
or self-preservation,

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.400
but out of actual deference to

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:47.400
the environment.

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:48.400
Like you said.

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:49.400
I'm just...

01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:51.400
I think that's cool and neat.

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:52.400
Like very heroic.

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.400
Like there's...

01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:56.400
There's different cultures out there

01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:57.400
where we're all warring with each other.

01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:59.400
There's people that are militant about the

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:01.400
fact that I don't want to throw them

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:02.400
under the bus if they're like,

01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:03.400
if someone's gay and they're out there,

01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:04.400
I'm going to out them.

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:05.400
That whole thing that we were going

01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:06.400
through in the 90s when it was like,

01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:07.400
you're out.

01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:08.400
You're out.

01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:09.400
We're outing you.

01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:10.400
And then other people are going,

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:11.400
well, wait.

01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:12.400
How is that helping if the person

01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:13.400
wants to be in the closet?

01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:15.400
There are very confusing issues and stuff.

01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:16.400
So I find that fascinating.

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:19.400
You have to just sit on a couch with

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:22.400
cup holders and think about that shit

01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:23.400
a lot.

01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:24.400
Like you have to...

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:26.400
Nobody else has to...

01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.400
Most other people don't have to think

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:30.400
that much about that shit,

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.400
which is actually part and parcel of...

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.400
On the reverse side,

01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:35.400
isn't that part of the problem?

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:36.400
When we run into bigotry and stuff,

01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:38.400
it's like people going,

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:40.400
what, I got to think about this now?

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:42.400
And it's like an un-plowed sidewalk

01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:43.400
in front of their house that you didn't

01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:44.400
tell them they had.

01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:46.400
And they're like, oh, and resent that.

01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:48.400
Like I don't have work to do.

01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:50.400
I think there's a deeper psychological

01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:52.400
and personality thing that goes into

01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:53.400
this that...

01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.400
I think just about anybody can come up

01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:57.400
with some...

01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.400
Some binary that they're a part of,

01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:01.400
some system that's imposed on them.

01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:03.400
But the real issue is what you...

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.400
Is buried in what you were saying,

01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:07.400
is this idea of being self-examining.

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.400
And being...

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:10.400
Either just by your personal nature,

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:12.400
you need to be able to think about

01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:14.400
how you think, you need to think about

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:15.400
how you fit in.

01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:17.400
And if you have...

01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:18.400
Unfortunately, if you have the privilege,

01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:20.400
or if you're higher up Maslow's pyramid,

01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:22.400
that you actually have the resources

01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:24.400
and the privilege and the opportunity

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:26.400
to really dig into yourself

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.400
without sacrificing the fact that you don't have...

01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:30.400
I've got a place to live,

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:31.400
I've got food, I've got clothes,

01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:32.400
I've got family, I've got friends.

01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:33.400
Okay, good.

01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:35.400
I can think about whether or not

01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:39.400
my gender identity matches

01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:40.400
my equipment.

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.400
That's a privilege.

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.400
And then to be able to actually act on it,

01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:45.400
that's another privilege.

01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:46.400
And to be able to act on it

01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:48.400
with a certain amount of safety,

01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:49.400
that's another privilege.

01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:51.400
And a lot of people don't get to that point.

01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:53.400
But I think everybody...

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:56.400
I believe in my heart, everybody...

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:59.400
Nobody fits in to anything.

01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:02.400
The game is to figure out...

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:04.400
That's why when they hear the word privilege,

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:05.400
they...

01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:07.400
The alarms go up.

01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:08.400
Because...

01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:12.400
They think that it precedes

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:14.400
their fire truck being taken away.

01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:15.400
You're privileged.

01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:17.400
You have too much already,

01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:19.400
and they feel like Judge Reinhold

01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:23.400
in fast times, when the guidance counselor says,

01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:24.400
sorry, but the party's over.

01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:27.400
He's like, I'm waiting for it to start.

01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:30.400
That's what privileged people feel

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:31.400
when they hear the word privilege,

01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:33.400
is they're like, wait, privilege.

01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:35.400
I just finished arguing with a lady at the bank

01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:37.400
that it's my money,

01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:39.400
and you're telling me stuff about...

01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:42.400
And so it's not to validate anger and hatred,

01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:45.400
but just to say, that's what's happening.

01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:47.400
We all got a lot of shit to deal with,

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:50.400
and the word privilege is being perceived too much.

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:52.400
It's like, someone wants your pants.

01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:53.400
You have too much pants.

01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:54.400
No one wants your pants.

01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.400
You don't have to give anybody your pants.

01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:58.400
It's just never going to happen.

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:01.400
No one's going to come in and take your pants.

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:04.400
And that is what we get down to.

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:06.400
I'm proud of my race, and I'm proud of my gender,

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.400
because it's like...

01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:10.400
There's almost an uplifting silver lining there

01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:12.400
where it's like, well,

01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:15.400
we used to be worried about who's going to take our property,

01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:16.400
who's going to...

01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:18.400
We're a First World Empire,

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:22.400
so we could be within reach of actual evolution

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:26.400
if the timeline goes one way instead of the other,

01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:29.400
because we've really gotten down to shit

01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:31.400
that are so fundamental to human nature.

01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:33.400
We've gotten to this point where we're actually recognizing,

01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:35.400
what's our fear point?

01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:38.400
What really motivates us or demotivates us?

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:39.400
You can always sense how like,

01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:41.400
Meg and Kelly talking all of a sudden,

01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:43.400
like the Fox News thing,

01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:46.400
it's like, that's what draws those viewers.

01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:48.400
It's that thing of like,

01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:50.400
up next, a law that says,

01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:53.400
Santa has to be Mexican?

01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:57.400
And they feed into this fear.

01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:00.400
Folks in Acapulco say yes.

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:03.400
And there's always this unspoken story of,

01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:05.400
what's next? What's next? What's next?

01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:06.400
What are they going to do next?

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:07.400
What are they going to take away next?

01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:09.400
And it's like, nothing's ever been taken from you,

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:11.400
and nothing's ever been given to you either.

01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:13.400
Like, you don't even have that much.

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:15.400
If you're proud of Santa Claus' color,

01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:19.400
like, you might be fucking disenfranchised too.

01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:24.400
Like, you might be...

01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:25.400
The fucking redneck.

01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:26.400
You might be...

01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:31.400
You might have been handed a pack of saltine crackers

01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:35.400
by your mama and told that that's a six-course meal.

01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:39.400
And that no one's ever going to take these saltines away from you, baby.

01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:41.400
And it's like...

01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:42.400
It's like, there's a bit...

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:44.400
Like, when people get upset, when they go like,

01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:48.400
Santa Claus, there's a bi-racial Santa Claus at the mall.

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:49.400
What's going...

01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:50.400
How could that happen?

01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:53.400
50 years ago, Santa was white all the time.

01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:55.400
Now he's bi-racial.

01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:56.400
I can't take it.

01:53:56.400 --> 01:54:01.400
It happens so fast.

01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:07.400
The good news with that is that if Santa Claus' color can change that quickly,

01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:10.400
that means you're a weak from being smart.

01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:15.400
Like, you can change faster.

01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:17.400
You're not a fucking logo.

01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:18.400
You're not a children's book.

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:20.400
You're not a classic television show.

01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:22.400
You're not a comic book.

01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:24.400
Like, you're a fucking human being.

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:26.400
And there is...

01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:30.400
You could have a new tradition that wouldn't be easily defileable

01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:32.400
because it wouldn't be based on race.

01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:34.400
Like, it would be having corporate...

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.400
We've done that with everything else.

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:37.400
No one got mad.

01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:39.400
Well, actually, people did.

01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:41.400
When someone invented the heater,

01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:42.400
and someone was probably like,

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:43.400
Heaters?

01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:48.400
That little tiny atom's making me hot instead of open flame?

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:50.400
What's next?

01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:52.400
My baby living longer?

01:54:52.400 --> 01:55:00.400
Like, progress fucks with shit that was happening yesterday.

01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:03.400
Oh, in every fucking fundamental way.

01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:06.400
What? I can't eat meat now?

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:08.400
Why always eat meat?

01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:11.400
But was this meat country?

01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:13.400
Was this white country?

01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:14.400
It wasn't anything.

01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:18.400
Your culture was a collection of fucking references.

01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:21.400
Like, it was like, oh, Green Lantern's white.

01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:24.400
Stephen King's a writer.

01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:26.400
Everyone should have two dogs.

01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:28.400
Fireplaces are square.

01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:30.400
It's just random shit.

01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:31.400
Like, that shit changing isn't good.

01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:32.400
What am I talking about?

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:34.400
What did I...

01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:36.400
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:38.400
That's been our show.

01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:43.400
Let's hear for Dr. Jane.

01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:46.400
Congratulations, Jane.

01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:48.400
Thank you for our glasses

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:51.400
and our beautiful foam cutouts.

01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:54.400
Brought to you by Excelsior Foam Inserts.

01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:57.400
The finest at Foam Inserts.

01:55:57.400 --> 01:56:00.400
We want Foam Inserts at Excelsior Foam Inserts.

01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:05.400
Steve Levy.

01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:08.400
The guy that gave us the Werner Herzog book.

01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:12.400
Spencer Crittenden.

01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:15.400
Descend.

01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:18.400
Devon Cook.

01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:21.400
Devon Cook, Jane's son.

01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:22.400
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:25.400
You may as well stand, Harmon.

01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:31.400
See you next week.

01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:49.400
Have a great day.

01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:51.400
Did you get any of that?

01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:57.400
It's a good show.

01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:02.400
Feral Audio.
