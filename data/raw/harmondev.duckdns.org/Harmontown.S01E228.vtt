You're so drunk.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nI'm not drunk at all.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:24.000\nYou're not drunk. All right.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nWell, good that I'm really not judging.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:28.000\nI'm just concerned about you now.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nYou're drunk.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:39.000\nMy voice is scratchy, so I'm going to kind of come in and out vocally.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:41.000\nOh, okay. All right.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:43.000\nWell, I, uh...\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nI, uh...\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nI have a scratchy voice, too,\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:50.000\nso it's going to take me a second to pull up my notes.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nI thought you were going to say,\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:55.000\nI apologize, but that was never going to happen.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:57.000\nWell, what did I... I'm sorry.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:00.000\nI'm sorry I accused you of being drunk.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nIs that what I did wrong?\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:05.000\nThat's for starters.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nI was dismissive of you as a person.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nYes.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nWhich is bad.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:12.000\nAgreed.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:14.000\nMakes you feel bad, and, uh, I...\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nAnd it also breaks one of my four agreements,\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nwhich is I was not impeccable with my word.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nI used my word to...\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:23.000\nDid you create black magic instead of white magic?\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nWhich seems racist.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nA racist distinction, but maybe the...\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:32.000\nMaybe the fifth agreement is be racist, and the guy just left that out of the book\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:36.000\nbecause he knew it's some more copies. I don't know.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nHe talks a lot about black magic and white magic.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:41.000\nI'm like, careful.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nBut at any rate, uh...\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nI cast some black magic on you.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nBad magic.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.000\nSorry. It won't happen again.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:52.000\nWell, I can't... I can't make assumptions.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nI will try to make it stop happening.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:58.000\nI'm working on it. I'm in therapy.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:01.000\nLet's see, Meryl Streep.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nAre you drunk?\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nNo, no.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:08.000\nNot yet. I mean, I'm gonna get drunk up here.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:12.000\nUh, all right. Well, so, I mean, just, you know, politics corner.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nLike...\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nSo, Spencer...\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nHey, guys.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nWhoa, you're drunk.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nNo, man.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nNo.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:29.000\nIsn't it perfectly feasible to accept election results\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:32.000\nand also want the winner investigated for treason?\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:35.000\nLike, can't you just... Why is it every time?\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nIt's like, this is a big deal.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nLike, it's... The intelligence community say,\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:44.000\nokay, yeah, there was an order to interfere.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nThere was all these things.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:51.000\nNow, the only thing left to do is to ask who knew what and when.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nIf there was collusion, it really doesn't matter.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:57.000\nYeah, if, for instance, Roger Stone was tweeting evidence of collusion\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:00.000\nwith Julian Assange before the WikiLeaks leaks dropped,\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:05.000\nthat would be very highly interesting for, you know, maybe people to know.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nYeah.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:12.000\nLike, if he, for instance, tweeted three separate times,\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:17.000\nyou know, like, weird things that alluded to the fact that Julian Assange\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:20.000\nis looking to leak helpful stuff to his campaign\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nand that they were gonna win the election for it,\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:26.000\nthat might be really, you might be able to build a case off of something like that.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nI need, I need something that's more just,\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:32.000\nI would like to maybe take up just a peek at the tax forms.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:36.000\nYeah, no, I'm just saying, just as a starting point on public record where,\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:39.000\nI mean, that's just, you know, that should, that alone should be like,\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:43.000\nyeah, let's investigate this whole fucking thing.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:47.000\nYeah, because didn't we put people to death because they told some people\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nabout some stuff with the atomic bomb?\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nI mean, we take treason very seriously still in this case.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nIt's treason, we call it treason.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nYeah, it's a bad word.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:58.000\nAnd it says, it doesn't, but if you say anything like,\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:01.000\nwell, this seems bad, we should look into this.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nWhat you get back is, yeah, but emails.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:07.000\nAnd I'm like, okay, but that election's over, kid,\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:10.000\nor are you a Russian troll bot now?\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:14.000\nBut like, okay, so that election is over,\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:18.000\nwe just need to now know, preferably before the inauguration,\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\ndoes he belong in prison?\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:23.000\nLike, congratulations, you won.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:29.000\nNow, I need to see all of your tax information from your 1987\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:33.000\nwhen you were going over to Russia to talk about building hotels\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:36.000\nall the way through you, you know, marrying your Czechoslovakian wife.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nYeah, I mean, it's common knowledge.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:41.000\nHe can't borrow from American banks.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:44.000\nHe is tied up in Russian financial assets.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:47.000\nAnd that's just, we know that, we can't prove it,\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:51.000\nbut everyone knows that, and it's like that might very well lead\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:54.000\nexactly, it might say like Putin, like personal check,\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nit might say that.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nThere might be, isn't this all the government?\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:01.000\nI mean, what can't you just now at this point,\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nif all of the intelligence agencies say, yeah, this is a thing,\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:06.000\ncan't you now just even, you don't even have to subpoena,\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\ncan't you just walk across the hall to the IRS\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:11.000\nand take something from one cabinet and put it in another cabinet?\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:14.000\nYeah, you would think, you certainly would think.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:17.000\nAlso, in a world where you can hack everything,\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nsomebody hack this motherfucker?\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nHack him up?\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:26.000\nLike, how do we get our best people or our worst people on the job\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:29.000\nand hack his tax returns?\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:33.000\nMost people believe that that probably has happened long ago,\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:36.000\neither at the same time as the, I mean, because what better,\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:39.000\nall the better, I mean, that's just pure speculation at this point,\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:43.000\nbut it also just makes perfect sense from a game theory perspective\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:47.000\nto just like go, okay, now we have all the, you know,\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:50.000\nall of the information on them as well,\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:54.000\nand now you just have a president, like, it's a crazy sci-fi novel.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nBut I don't want to go that far because it's like,\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:00.000\nit gets tangled up in this thing where people think that you're trying to say\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:04.000\nhe's not allowed to be president, no fairies do overzees.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:10.000\nI'm not saying that, I just want to know if my new president belongs in prison yet.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:14.000\nI'm a firm believer in the, I think it's the 13th amendment,\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:17.000\nwhich is no cuts, no butts, no coconuts.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:26.000\nAnd it's insane that 20 amendments later, women were, we got the coconuts.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nYeah, why was that?\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nIt took us so fucking long, it was crazy.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nWe're so backwards as a people.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:38.000\nThat's like, all right, so, yeah, so I almost drowned in Fiji,\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:40.000\nbut Cody saved me.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nWait, I didn't hear it by this.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:45.000\nI was with you for a week in New York, I didn't know that you almost died.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:48.000\nWell, it wasn't like, I mean, it was to be expected,\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:52.000\nlike, when you look at me and imagine me walking into the ocean,\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nlike, what do you think is going to happen?\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:57.000\nSo I didn't think it was like big news, I was like,\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nit would be like if I went on a roller coaster and I was like,\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:04.000\nI got pretty sick and I wouldn't like even tweet that, I'd be like...\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.000\nBut not to be diminishing, you seem buoyant.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:11.000\nWhich is what Cody is assuring me.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nShe's like, you'll float, you'll float.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nAnd I'm like, no did, but I'm dying.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:19.000\nLike, I swear it was just like muscle to like weight or something.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nI don't know, it's like, I just kept, she's like a little bean\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nand she fucking like zips.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nWe were not snorkeling and she's like,\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nlike a UFO.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:31.000\nAnd when she was a little speck, I was like, Cody, Cody, too far.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:35.000\nThen I came out a little bit more and I was like,\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:40.000\nflippers aren't touching the sand, that's my deal breaker in snorkeling.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:43.000\nI need flippers, flipper tips to touch sand.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nI'm not a pussy.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:49.000\nI'm not saying I need to be able to stand up and have my head above our,\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:55.000\nI just need to be able to graze the sand with my flipper tips.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nAnd when that stopped being a...\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:01.000\nFlipper tips go whoo-woop.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nThat's only in the mountain.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nYou're supposed to be making breakfast.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nYou're supposed to be making breakfast.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nThat's like an alarm clock.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nIt's just for decoration, man.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nThat's all.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nThat's all, man.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nAll right, we're dating ourselves.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nWe are?\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nHow romantic.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:31.000\nNext thing we'll be talking about techno viking.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nThese kids...\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:37.000\nTheir first memory is the OK Go video.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:41.000\nIt was playing in the maternity word lobby.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nSo anyway, yeah.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nSo I was...\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:49.000\nI was floating and I saw her little head.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nI'm like, well, if my flippers can't touch sand,\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nshe's in shark world.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nYou should come back and she's like, zip, OK.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nAnd then she went away.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nAnd I was like, all right, that's good.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:03.000\nAnd by doing this for like 20 minutes,\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:07.000\nlook at the sand underneath.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nIt's so great to have a snorkel as I can breathe.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:13.000\nAnd then I just look up and I'm like in the same spot.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nAnd she's just...\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nAnd then I was like, Kodak!\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nAfter a while.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nI said, I'm starting to panic.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nI said, don't panic.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nI am already.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nI waited until I started to say something.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nAnd she's like...\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nAnd I was like...\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nAnd then I just started...\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nAt a certain point she comes over and she's like, just paddle.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nAnd I'm like, I've been paddling and I'm yelling at her.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nI'm like, this is how people die.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nThis is how they die.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nAnd she says...\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:47.000\nI got to a point, I swear, where I said go on without me.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.000\nAnd here's why.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nBecause I was that convinced I was actually dying.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:55.000\nBelieve me, if I thought I had a chance at survival,\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:59.000\nI would have risked killing her trying to live.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nI'm not a hero.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:05.000\nI just was so certain she couldn't save me.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:09.000\nI didn't want to die and also have her blood on my hands.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nSo I was like, just go.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nI don't want to die an extra guilty death.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nI just want to feel bad about everything I've eaten.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nAnd while I slowly sink to the bottom,\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:23.000\nthe four foot, four foot ocean floor.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:27.000\nOne flipper length away from the bottom.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:31.000\nOh, by the way, a crab crawled on my fucking body.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:35.000\nBefore I got out there, that should have been an omen.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nI shouldn't have gone out there.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nThere's sticks and shit.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nIt's all beautiful. It's crystal blue ocean.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nAnd you can see the ground through it.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nAnd it'll be like a diaper.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:49.000\nAnd I won't assume it's like negative parents.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.000\nI'm assuming it's like an adventurous kid or something.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:55.000\nBut like sticks and moss.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nSo you try to steer clear of the debris\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nand then some shit hits you.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nAnd then there was like a thing.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nIt was like a little tickle thing.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nAnd I was like, yeah, what is that?\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:06.000\nAnd then I turn around.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nI'm like, what the hell was that tickle?\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nThere was a fucking crab going, what are you doing?\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nAnd I was like, ah, ah.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nBut you're moving in water and you can't.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nI'm like the Titanic and he's like a little DiCaprio.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.000\nLike he's just moving.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nI didn't see the movie,\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:24.000\nthe physics involved in it was part of the plot.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.000\nIt's like moving towards me.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:30.000\nSo I'm trying to do like the dune blade thing\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:33.000\nwhere it's like I move slow so that I can get out.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nBut the crab is faster.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nAnd he wants to be on me and I don't know why.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nAnd then he crawled back on me again.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:42.000\nSo I take out my snorkel, my breathing apparatus.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nI'm like, okay, got that.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nAnd then I hear this laughing.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nAnd it's these four Fijian kids\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:51.000\nwho are like 20 feet away and they're just laughing and pointing\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nand it actually made me feel better.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:56.000\nBecause the Fijian people are very, very nice\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:59.000\nand children of course, as we all know, are wonderful.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nBut they weren't like, I don't think they were like,\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nthey weren't like, ha, ha, he's going to die.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:06.000\nSo I was like, they were like, ha, ha, that must be a crab.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\nLike they could tell from my movements.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nIt was like, look at his first crab or something.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:14.000\nAnd I was like, oh, if that's a bit here, then I'm safe.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:18.000\nThey look like fucking cartoon crabs.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:23.000\nIt looks like a goddamn deep fried soft shell crab,\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nbut it's alive.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nWait.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nTry to paint the picture for me.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nIt's crab shaped?\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:39.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:40.000\nOkay.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nSo then I get out there and I'm like, die.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nAnd then Cody's like trying to haul me.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nAnd I'm like, you're just going to kill yourself.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nJust get out of here.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nAnd she's like, Dan, just grab Otto's.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nBut you thought you were going to take her down with you?\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nThat's why I said, go on without me.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nBecause that's what they teach you in swim class.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nI took a swim class.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:01.000\nI mean, in gym, they said like, don't, if somebody's drowning,\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:04.000\nyou know, you got to know how to save people a certain way\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nif you're a lifeguard because people just,\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\ndrowning people will just kill you.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.000\nThey're just weapons in the water.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:13.000\nThey don't even know they'll kill you as soon as they look at you\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:14.000\nbecause they're drowning.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:17.000\nThey've been given, they're like a 28 days later person.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nThey don't even know who you are.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nThey're just trying to stay above water.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:24.000\nAnd if you go out to them, they'll try to climb on top of you.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:29.000\nAnd then they'll like, I need four more people so I can stand.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:33.000\nAnd then they'll be like, Josh, oh, they'll feel terrible.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nBut it'll be too late for Josh.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:40.000\nDon't be a Josh is what they said was the poster in the lifeguard,\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nlifeguard class that I took.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nSo I said, go on without me.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:48.000\nBut then what I did is she did like a little frog stroke thing.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:51.000\nAnd I just, I just grabbed her a little butt.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:55.000\nAnd she just slowly towed me into shore.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:58.000\nAnd I was like, well, if I, yeah, I just died,\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\njust squeezing this little tushy.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:01.000\nIt was nice. It was nice.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:02.000\nShe was right.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:05.000\nIt wasn't really anywhere near death ever.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.000\nBut it's the thought that counts.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nI think with near death experiences,\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:13.000\nif you think that you're dying, then that's because it's,\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nthat doesn't count with murder.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:20.000\nBut with death near death experience, the thought does count.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nThe thought doesn't count with murder.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nAttempted murder, the thought counts.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nIn the eyes of the law.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nRight.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:31.000\nSo anyways.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nI'm glad you're alive.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nThat would have been a trouble way to die.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nYeah.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nYeah.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:42.000\nI saw this, I saw this like forensic files or something where a guy like,\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:46.000\na guy like took three women out on a boat and he had his way with them.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:47.000\nYeah, I saw that one.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:48.000\nYou saw that one?\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:49.000\nYeah, I've seen them all.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nAnd then, and then, and then just cinder blocks.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:52.000\nYeah.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:53.000\nFuck it.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nThat's, that's the worst way to die.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nRight.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:59.000\nLike being alive and being thrown overboard with a thing, you know.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:00.000\nYeah, that's fucked up.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:01.000\nThat's gotta be the worst way to die.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nAnd also, what, you're shaking your head?\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:05.000\nSteve Levy has, has better way.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:09.000\nSteve, Steve, just going like this.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:15.000\nHe's like, no, no, anti-aircraft round shot from the 300 meters through your gallbladder.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.000\nYou'll, you'll die over three days.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:18.000\nLike he has some dark thought in him.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:23.000\nThe thing about, if I, if I'm remembering that forensic files well enough, it was,\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nthey didn't all go over at once.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:28.000\nLike one girl watched them all go over.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nLike she knew she was next.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:36.000\nIt's not just, oh, I'm not, and I, and I will pass out in 30 seconds.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:39.000\nShe watched the whole thing go and that's fucked up.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:40.000\nYeah.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:43.000\nShe's like, she's like, he's not going to do that and then bring me into shore.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:45.000\nAnd like, so tell me about yourself.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:52.000\nLike one, one Peron, like in Argentina, like during, during his reign, when they had dissidents\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:57.000\nthere, the way that they got rid of people, they would fly a plane up and everyone that\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:58.000\nwas on the ground saw the plane.\n\n20:58.000 --> 20:59.000\nThey know what was happening.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:03.000\nThey'd fly him over the river and they would just toss you out of the plane.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:05.000\nBut they didn't just fly you up and toss you out.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:10.000\nThey flew you around for a while and they blindfolded you and the plane was full of just piss and\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:14.000\nshit because everybody's emptying their bowels because they know what's going to happen.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:22.000\nPerhaps he's wondering why you'd shoot a man before throwing him out of a plane.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:27.000\nThat's a little bane.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nBatman 3.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:35.000\nA little movie called Batman 3 that's from, I mean, Littlefinger fucking got it in that\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:36.000\nplane, right?\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:37.000\nOr wait, was that Littlefinger?\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nYeah, that was Littlefinger.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:39.000\nYeah.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nYeah.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:41.000\nYeah.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:42.000\nWhat a show.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:43.000\nWhat a new year.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nWhat a show.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:49.000\nSo, all right, so here's my last Fiji thing I'll share.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:52.000\nEverybody's, oh, you're running into all your friends and they've all been somewhere and\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nthey've got to tell you a bunch of shit you don't care about.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:57.000\nI'm not accepted.\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:04.000\nI am no exception.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:12.000\nMy lack of exceptionality will make me unaccepted when I tell you my last Fiji story.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:17.000\nSo, everybody, when you land, everybody goes, you've got to try kava.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nYou've got to do this kava stuff.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:24.000\nAnd so, I asked at the resort, I had no plans on stepping off at the resort, but I also\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:26.000\nwas curious, is this a place where you can step off at the resort?\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:27.000\nI'm not a worldly man.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nI'm not a geopolitical expert.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:30.000\nI dropped out of college.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:31.000\nI don't know.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:35.280\nSo, I asked the driver all the way from the airport because the airport was either under\n\n22:35.280 --> 22:39.000\na lot of construction or maybe it's a third world country.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:43.000\nAnd I was safer to assume the latter.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:51.000\nI didn't see any part in our dust signs and I didn't see any portraits of anybody that\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:54.000\nlooked democratically elected.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:59.000\nSo, I asked a few questions on the ride to the resort.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nSo, how does the government work here?\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nIt was like, oh, it's a democracy.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:05.000\nI'm like, all right.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nWhat do you have?\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:08.000\nA president?\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nIs there a president and a prime minister?\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nSo, how often do you have elections?\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:14.000\nFour or five years?\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:18.000\nWhy does it change sometimes?\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:21.000\nWell, we're in a little bit of a transition.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:22.000\nOkay.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\nAll right.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:24.000\nOkay.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:25.000\nThat's all I needed to hear.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.000\nBut then I heard some more.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nThey're in the military and their buddy's the prime minister and the president.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:32.000\nThey run things and they run a tight ship over there.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.000\nSo, I'm like, that doesn't really tell me.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.000\nI was like, well, are tourists safe?\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nLike, are you driving through these neighborhoods?\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:45.000\nLike, it's definitely poverty, but you're not seeing like crime poverty.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nIt's not like broken windows.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\nIt's just like poverty.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:57.000\nSo, which is a thing that my western brain is kind of like not, the big part of the story\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nis that I'm not really able to compute that yet.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:05.000\nLike, if I see certain physical characteristics of a building or a vehicle or something like that,\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:10.000\nI'm immediately feeling like I'm in danger and this is a pretty broke place if you're\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:11.000\nnot on a resort.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:15.000\nAnd so, I was like, yeah, I would probably just stay on the resort the whole time.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:19.000\nSo, I go up to the bartender at the resort and go, so what's the deal with the Kava thing?\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nWhat's the Kava situation?\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:22.000\nOh.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:24.000\nThey do this thing.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nI'm like, okay, it's like a gimmick here.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nI think that's like Kava.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:32.000\nAnd then he's like, he says to the guy, and then another guy, and the other guy says, like,\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\noh, you have to do it in a ritual.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:38.320\nOkay, sure, beer pong, you can say the same thing.\n\n24:38.320 --> 24:42.520\nAnd it's like, well, there's another ritual.\n\n24:42.520 --> 24:43.760\nOh, there's no ritual schedule\n\n24:43.760 --> 24:45.120\nbecause it's the holidays or something like that.\n\n24:45.120 --> 24:46.960\nOr you'll have to schedule and talk to my boss,\n\n24:46.960 --> 24:47.880\nthere's someone's up.\n\n24:47.880 --> 24:50.080\nSo I'm like, and I go to Cody and I say,\n\n24:50.080 --> 24:53.240\nwe have to schedule a ritual if we want to do kava, is that?\n\n24:53.240 --> 24:58.240\nAnd then the pool boy is like, do you want to do kava?\n\n24:59.280 --> 25:01.040\nI'm like, yes, pool boy, I do.\n\n25:01.040 --> 25:06.040\nAnd he says, you can do kava with me and my family.\n\n25:09.240 --> 25:12.120\nAnd I'm like, okay, pool boy, please go on.\n\n25:12.120 --> 25:14.000\nAnd he's like, well, you could do it here,\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:15.560\nbut if you want it, do you want to do it in the village?\n\n25:15.560 --> 25:17.800\nAnd Cody's like, yeah, you're supposed to do it in the village.\n\n25:17.800 --> 25:20.120\nThat's what I heard, do it in the village.\n\n25:20.120 --> 25:23.080\nAnd I'm like, okay, well, how would we do it in the village?\n\n25:23.080 --> 25:24.720\nWell, you know, I'll pick you up.\n\n25:24.720 --> 25:28.400\nLike, let's see, I get out of here like seven, eight.\n\n25:28.400 --> 25:30.800\nI was like, half past eight, meet me.\n\n25:30.800 --> 25:32.440\nI'll just meet me outside,\n\n25:32.440 --> 25:36.560\nand I'll take you to my neighborhood and we'll do kava.\n\n25:36.560 --> 25:38.960\nAnd go in the back, in the back,\n\n25:38.960 --> 25:40.680\nbecause the front is like, bleh.\n\n25:40.680 --> 25:44.920\nBut he's like, everyone in Fiji has this,\n\n25:44.920 --> 25:49.360\nit just radiates with this joy, this friendliness,\n\n25:49.360 --> 25:52.080\nwhich if you don't trust them,\n\n25:52.080 --> 25:54.600\nmakes it seem like the first act of an Eli Roth movie.\n\n25:54.600 --> 25:59.600\nLike, not that Eli Roth movies are famous for their structure.\n\n25:59.600 --> 26:03.400\nI just like, but they do have first acts.\n\n26:03.400 --> 26:05.800\nThresholds are crossed, and before they are,\n\n26:05.800 --> 26:08.560\npeople are like, yay, it would take our shirt off\n\n26:08.560 --> 26:10.360\nand laugh, have fun, and then everyone's happy,\n\n26:10.360 --> 26:13.040\nand then there's these welding torches and things.\n\n26:13.040 --> 26:15.400\nSo, like he has an ove.\n\n26:15.400 --> 26:20.400\nOkay, so he's like, and I made a couple of jokes\n\n26:23.560 --> 26:26.360\nbecause I'm like, I don't want to be offensive.\n\n26:26.360 --> 26:27.880\nThat would be an awful thing,\n\n26:27.880 --> 26:31.560\nbut I do also want to say out loud if I'm gonna die,\n\n26:31.560 --> 26:33.280\nlike, we're not gonna die, are we?\n\n26:33.280 --> 26:36.760\nAnd so I did, and he's like, come on, it's Fiji man, come on.\n\n26:36.760 --> 26:38.000\nI'm not trying to do their accent,\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:39.400\nit's like part Jamaican part,\n\n26:39.400 --> 26:40.560\nlike I don't know something else,\n\n26:40.560 --> 26:41.920\nlike it sounds like they're just,\n\n26:41.920 --> 26:45.240\nit's islandy and joyful, and it's all smiles,\n\n26:45.240 --> 26:47.080\nand just relax, and so you don't know,\n\n26:47.080 --> 26:49.080\nyou're just thinking like, I'm gonna die.\n\n26:49.080 --> 26:53.400\nSo you're doing village kava, not pool boy family kava?\n\n26:53.400 --> 26:55.120\nWe're doing, no, we're doing,\n\n26:55.120 --> 26:58.400\nthe village is pool boy's family.\n\n26:58.400 --> 26:59.320\nOkay.\n\n26:59.320 --> 27:00.160\nYeah.\n\n27:01.480 --> 27:02.840\nWe're doing that versus.\n\n27:02.840 --> 27:04.400\nBut you're not doing the sanctioned hotels or anything.\n\n27:04.400 --> 27:06.720\nWe're not doing safety belt, like, yeah,\n\n27:06.720 --> 27:09.360\noverseeing like candlelight dinner.\n\n27:09.360 --> 27:11.320\nYou're doing Eli Roth kava.\n\n27:11.320 --> 27:16.040\nYeah, it's like you and Tim Allen's family is joining you\n\n27:16.040 --> 27:19.200\nbecause they also wanted to do kava, like no,\n\n27:19.200 --> 27:20.760\nwe're not doing that.\n\n27:20.760 --> 27:23.280\nWe're getting into the pool boy's car\n\n27:23.280 --> 27:26.320\nunder cover of darkness off of the resort,\n\n27:26.320 --> 27:29.360\npassed a sign that says, don't do this,\n\n27:31.120 --> 27:33.120\nby a bridge where there was a dog eating,\n\n27:33.120 --> 27:35.600\nwe don't know what, it could have been another dog.\n\n27:36.960 --> 27:41.640\nThe dog was stoked, but that could be because,\n\n27:41.640 --> 27:45.440\nyou know, he won, he was friendly,\n\n27:45.440 --> 27:49.280\nbut he licked Cody and she was like, oh, he's so cute.\n\n27:49.280 --> 27:52.640\nOh, oh, it was like a rat licked her, you know,\n\n27:52.640 --> 27:55.440\nlike it was like, he was vermin,\n\n27:55.440 --> 27:57.600\nlike we think dogs are man's best friend,\n\n27:57.600 --> 28:00.320\nbut they're vermin's in some places, vermin dog,\n\n28:00.320 --> 28:01.320\nit was a vermin dog.\n\n28:03.080 --> 28:05.160\nAnd they run around everywhere, they're just dogs, you know.\n\n28:05.160 --> 28:06.640\nYou should have a travel show.\n\n28:06.640 --> 28:07.480\nYeah.\n\n28:07.480 --> 28:08.320\nYou should like.\n\n28:08.320 --> 28:12.640\nSo we go out to the bridge,\n\n28:12.640 --> 28:14.240\nbut they put the place where they say,\n\n28:14.240 --> 28:17.080\ndon't, it says, don't go past this,\n\n28:17.080 --> 28:18.160\nthe sign to the resort.\n\n28:18.160 --> 28:19.440\nWell, they're biased, you know,\n\n28:19.440 --> 28:20.880\nof course they want you to stay there.\n\n28:20.880 --> 28:21.720\nYeah.\n\n28:21.720 --> 28:22.800\nIt's their money.\n\n28:22.800 --> 28:26.360\nSo, but also that's the same sign they'd have there\n\n28:26.360 --> 28:27.200\nif you were going to die.\n\n28:27.200 --> 28:29.360\nRemember the crocodile that everyone blamed the family\n\n28:29.360 --> 28:30.920\nfor, you know, they're an alligator or whatever?\n\n28:30.920 --> 28:32.320\nIt's like, oh, there was a sign that said,\n\n28:32.320 --> 28:34.200\ndon't go over here in Disneyland\n\n28:34.200 --> 28:35.880\nand they went and the alligator ate their kid.\n\n28:35.880 --> 28:37.880\nAnd everyone was like, there was a thing.\n\n28:41.720 --> 28:43.480\nFucking don't side with a corporation\n\n28:43.480 --> 28:44.800\nif a wizard eats your kid.\n\n28:49.480 --> 28:50.840\nCan we have one fucking rule\n\n28:50.840 --> 28:53.080\nbefore we all blow ourselves up?\n\n28:53.080 --> 28:54.600\nCan we, can we, can we go out\n\n28:54.600 --> 28:57.680\nnot having sided with lizards?\n\n28:57.680 --> 29:00.520\nDo we have to, do we have to get that low before we die?\n\n29:00.520 --> 29:01.960\nI was like, I'm with the lizard.\n\n29:01.960 --> 29:03.480\nLet the lizard finish.\n\n29:04.680 --> 29:06.320\nHear him out.\n\n29:06.320 --> 29:07.840\nI'm just saying, there was a sign.\n\n29:07.840 --> 29:08.680\nChop, chop.\n\n29:14.440 --> 29:17.000\nSo you and Cody are in the backseat of a guy's car.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:18.520\nSo we get to the thing.\n\n29:18.520 --> 29:21.680\nAnd we, it's like, and then the guy's like,\n\n29:21.680 --> 29:22.640\nhe's not showing up.\n\n29:22.640 --> 29:25.440\nAnd like part of me is like, you know, like good.\n\n29:25.440 --> 29:27.680\nLike now I don't look like a pussy in front of Cody,\n\n29:27.680 --> 29:29.920\nbut also we're not going to die.\n\n29:29.920 --> 29:32.920\nSo like, we waited a half hour and it's like,\n\n29:32.920 --> 29:35.080\neven there's a whole thing, Fiji time, Fiji time,\n\n29:35.080 --> 29:36.280\nman, Fiji time.\n\n29:36.280 --> 29:37.560\nIt's like this joke.\n\n29:37.560 --> 29:39.360\nIt's like, look, if you have a name for it,\n\n29:39.360 --> 29:41.080\nthere's like T-shirts that say Fiji time.\n\n29:41.080 --> 29:42.280\nIt's like a whole thing where it's like,\n\n29:42.280 --> 29:45.000\noh, if you order a drink, you get it a half hour later.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:46.640\nHow long did it take you to make the T-shirt?\n\n29:46.640 --> 29:48.320\nFucking, just.\n\n29:48.320 --> 29:51.600\nMake the drink, not the T-shirt.\n\n29:51.600 --> 29:54.080\nDon't be proud of it.\n\n29:54.080 --> 29:56.520\nThey're not a tip motivated culture, Jeff.\n\n29:59.960 --> 30:03.240\nAll that anxiety that makes us shoot each other in the states.\n\n30:03.240 --> 30:07.480\nYou know, it's that's the dark side of the coin\n\n30:07.480 --> 30:10.040\nthat results in a little hustle when you order your drink.\n\n30:10.040 --> 30:13.880\nEveryone's freaking out and like, they got shit to do.\n\n30:13.880 --> 30:16.240\nThen you go to Toronto and they're like grilled cheese.\n\n30:16.240 --> 30:17.800\nAll right, if I feel like it.\n\n30:17.800 --> 30:20.920\nAnd you go to Australia and they're like, good day.\n\n30:20.920 --> 30:22.920\nBut good, good morrow, here's your drink.\n\n30:22.920 --> 30:24.360\nWhoa, I ordered this yesterday.\n\n30:24.360 --> 30:26.880\nIt was a good day.\n\n30:26.880 --> 30:29.880\nI don't know, I tried to riff a thing.\n\n30:29.880 --> 30:31.160\nI'm a world traveler now.\n\n30:31.160 --> 30:34.040\nEveryone's slow except America when you order your drink.\n\n30:34.040 --> 30:36.920\nThat's all I'm going to say about that.\n\n30:36.920 --> 30:42.160\nSo there's nothing coming.\n\n30:42.160 --> 30:43.040\nSo we go, OK, good.\n\n30:43.040 --> 30:44.400\nLet's just go watch forensic files\n\n30:44.400 --> 30:46.360\nso I can continue to be relaxed.\n\n30:46.360 --> 30:49.200\nAnd let's just like, let's just lay in a bed\n\n30:49.200 --> 30:52.400\nand there's birds and things that are a little alarming,\n\n30:52.400 --> 30:54.600\nbut whatever.\n\n30:54.600 --> 30:57.800\nSo what was Kava?\n\n30:57.800 --> 31:02.080\nSo then there's headlights.\n\n31:02.080 --> 31:02.960\nOh, there's headlights.\n\n31:02.960 --> 31:04.160\nOh, guys, there's headlights.\n\n31:04.160 --> 31:05.880\nAnd then it's like, that makes it even scarier\n\n31:05.880 --> 31:07.200\nbecause now you really feel like you're\n\n31:07.200 --> 31:10.000\nin this fucking Eli Roth movie because there's this moment\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nthat the director put in where you could have lived\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.400\nif you just hadn't fucking walked back.\n\n31:14.400 --> 31:16.160\nYou had every way to just walk away\n\n31:16.160 --> 31:17.640\nand there were headlights and then we all go back.\n\n31:17.640 --> 31:19.960\nAnd I just like, I'm like, so bummed out.\n\n31:19.960 --> 31:21.880\nI'm like, all right, let's go.\n\n31:21.880 --> 31:25.680\nAnd it's just a fucking like, shitty, shitty car pulls up.\n\n31:25.680 --> 31:26.800\nIt's just, dude.\n\n31:26.800 --> 31:29.280\nAnd then also there was just dudes in the bushes.\n\n31:29.280 --> 31:30.560\nLike, there had always been there.\n\n31:30.560 --> 31:36.160\nI was like, I thought that was the dog coughing the whole time,\n\n31:36.160 --> 31:39.920\nbut it was just like six people gone.\n\n31:39.920 --> 31:43.520\nLike, it was like they just came out of the bushes\n\n31:43.520 --> 31:46.720\nto freak us out as we entered the car, even though they weren't\n\n31:46.720 --> 31:47.680\nwith the people in the car.\n\n31:47.680 --> 31:51.040\nBut the pool boy gets out and it's like,\n\n31:51.040 --> 31:53.560\nwith a guy he doesn't introduce, he's smoking a cigarette,\n\n31:53.560 --> 31:56.920\nand he's just like, they just open the doors and the pool\n\n31:56.920 --> 32:01.880\nboy is like, OK, you ready?\n\n32:04.320 --> 32:07.640\nAnd I'm like, yeah?\n\n32:07.640 --> 32:09.760\nAnd then we get in the car and I'm just like,\n\n32:09.760 --> 32:13.800\nhanging on to that thing you never hang on to, not\n\n32:13.800 --> 32:16.720\nbecause they're driving fast, but just because I'm like,\n\n32:16.720 --> 32:18.800\nit's just something you do when you're freaked out.\n\n32:18.800 --> 32:22.640\nLike, you're just like, choo, choo.\n\n32:22.640 --> 32:25.680\nAnd they're playing music and they're strangers.\n\n32:25.680 --> 32:30.120\nAnd it's like, if the physical realities of what we were doing\n\n32:30.120 --> 32:32.040\nwere happening in the States, you'd be like,\n\n32:32.040 --> 32:34.240\nI think I might be in big trouble here.\n\n32:34.240 --> 32:39.720\nAnd you're trying to think, am I carrying bigoted first world\n\n32:39.720 --> 32:43.240\ncontaminated toxicity into this situation?\n\n32:43.240 --> 32:46.680\nIs this a story about me being an ignorant, white,\n\n32:46.680 --> 32:52.320\nlike fucking pig-headed, like judgmental, toxic person?\n\n32:52.320 --> 32:55.040\nOr is this going to be one of those stories where it's like,\n\n32:55.040 --> 32:56.680\nwhat were they thinking?\n\n32:56.680 --> 32:59.320\nLike, the editors of Dateline would be like,\n\n32:59.320 --> 33:02.240\nthis doesn't even merit an episode.\n\n33:02.240 --> 33:10.800\nJust send it to whoever replaced Bob Saget if there's video,\n\n33:10.800 --> 33:13.640\nassuming there's some video involved.\n\n33:13.640 --> 33:16.840\nBecause I think it'll be funny because they deserved it\n\n33:16.840 --> 33:17.800\nbecause they didn't listen.\n\n33:17.800 --> 33:19.680\nThey went to a different country and they just\n\n33:19.680 --> 33:22.320\ngot in a stranger's car, like fuck them.\n\n33:22.320 --> 33:23.800\nAre we in an urban legend?\n\n33:23.800 --> 33:26.000\nOr are we the urban legend?\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.680\nAre we the fucking dumb shitheads?\n\n33:28.680 --> 33:30.080\nSo I'm trying to split the difference\n\n33:30.080 --> 33:33.840\nso I'm being just silently terrified and not going,\n\n33:33.840 --> 33:35.120\nyou're not going to kill us, right?\n\n33:35.120 --> 33:40.600\nAnd Cody's is talking and going like, so do you have family?\n\n33:40.600 --> 33:43.040\nI'm thinking, good, smart Cody, smart.\n\n33:43.040 --> 33:44.000\nHumanize them.\n\n33:49.360 --> 33:50.960\nYeah, yeah, I have a daughter.\n\n33:50.960 --> 33:52.080\nWhat's your daughter's name?\n\n33:52.080 --> 33:54.360\nGood, genius, Cody, genius.\n\n33:54.360 --> 33:57.000\nIt's Marianne, and my wife's name is such a size.\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.160\nGood, good, good.\n\n33:59.160 --> 34:01.960\nSo it's having a half hour drive.\n\n34:01.960 --> 34:03.560\nAnd he says, oh, and then first you\n\n34:03.560 --> 34:06.040\nhave to go buy the kava.\n\n34:06.040 --> 34:09.200\nThis liquor store is just made out of chicken wire,\n\n34:09.200 --> 34:10.840\nand it smells like a diaper.\n\n34:10.840 --> 34:15.840\nAnd you get a big case of shitty beer, and you pay them,\n\n34:15.840 --> 34:17.840\nand it's all prearranged anyway.\n\n34:17.840 --> 34:18.960\nIt's like all the prices are.\n\n34:18.960 --> 34:22.040\nThey just get a big newspaper bundle full of this root\n\n34:22.040 --> 34:25.520\nthat is mystical.\n\n34:25.520 --> 34:29.640\nAnd I'll take a newspaper load of mystical roots\n\n34:29.640 --> 34:35.520\nand some jolly ranchers and a Michelob ultra.\n\n34:35.520 --> 34:38.320\nAnd then you get back in the car, you go to the thing,\n\n34:38.320 --> 34:40.600\nand he goes like, when we pull up to the house,\n\n34:40.600 --> 34:42.520\nmy whole family's going to come out.\n\n34:42.520 --> 34:44.320\nAnd they're going to be standing out there,\n\n34:44.320 --> 34:45.880\nand they're going to say, boo la boo la.\n\n34:45.880 --> 34:47.920\nAnd when you get out, just say, boo la boo la.\n\n34:47.920 --> 34:48.600\nYou're going to love it.\n\n34:48.600 --> 34:49.400\nIt's going to be great.\n\n34:49.400 --> 34:50.720\nYou're going to love my family, man.\n\n34:50.720 --> 34:52.160\nAnd then they only pull in.\n\n34:52.160 --> 34:55.200\nThat's how you get killed.\n\n34:55.200 --> 35:01.280\nAnd there's just like a dude by a mailbox,\n\n35:01.280 --> 35:03.360\nand he's smoking a cigarette, and he sees the car,\n\n35:03.360 --> 35:06.640\nand he makes a gesture at the guy, I think,\n\n35:06.640 --> 35:09.400\nand then the other driver's like, oh, and then the other guy's\n\n35:09.400 --> 35:12.240\nlike, oh, well, it says something.\n\n35:12.240 --> 35:14.040\nI mean, that sounds like a la Akbar, didn't I?\n\n35:14.040 --> 35:21.560\nThe guys, there's no family outside this Texas\n\n35:21.560 --> 35:26.000\nchainsaw massacre hut that there's just guys in the darkness\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.160\nthat you can only see them because they can't stop smoking.\n\n35:28.160 --> 35:30.720\nThere's just like little orange clothes that just,\n\n35:30.720 --> 35:32.400\nand then they're gone, and then you just\n\n35:32.400 --> 35:36.480\nlike darting eyes and like fucking like, step out.\n\n35:36.480 --> 35:37.920\nAnd there's no family out here.\n\n35:37.920 --> 35:40.640\nWe're like, we step out, and there's like one dude comes out,\n\n35:40.640 --> 35:50.040\nand we're like, boo la boo la, and then we go into the house.\n\n35:50.040 --> 35:50.600\nWhat?\n\n35:50.600 --> 35:54.000\nOh, there was a fucking tomb, yes, there was.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:55.120\nI think it was a tomb.\n\n35:55.120 --> 35:59.200\nThere was like a memorial plaque on top of a six foot\n\n35:59.200 --> 36:05.000\nby two foot by three foot high cement rectangle.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.840\nHad to be a tomb.\n\n36:07.840 --> 36:13.200\nAnyways, so we walk into the place,\n\n36:13.200 --> 36:17.360\nand there's his whole family, and his wife,\n\n36:17.360 --> 36:19.240\nand their beautiful little girl, and everyone's like,\n\n36:19.240 --> 36:21.800\nboo la boo la, and it's like, it's fucking fine.\n\n36:21.800 --> 36:24.040\nEverything's fine, because I am a bigot in a asshole\n\n36:24.040 --> 36:26.360\nand a fucking jerk.\n\n36:26.360 --> 36:27.800\nBecause immediately it was just like,\n\n36:27.800 --> 36:29.400\nyou could see the expression on their face,\n\n36:29.400 --> 36:31.760\nand then they had a bull out, and they knew we were coming,\n\n36:31.760 --> 36:32.960\nand they couldn't wait, and all this shit.\n\n36:32.960 --> 36:35.480\nAnd it was just like, oh, fuck.\n\n36:35.480 --> 36:40.320\nAnd the crazy thing is, how quickly, how sure I could be\n\n36:40.320 --> 36:46.000\nthat man is evil, that there's no fucking way.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:47.160\nI just thought, all the calculations\n\n36:47.160 --> 36:48.720\nI was doing in the car on the way there,\n\n36:48.720 --> 36:52.400\nwas like, I just kept thinking, well,\n\n36:52.400 --> 36:53.840\nthere's no way we're going to die,\n\n36:53.840 --> 36:58.840\nbecause he'd never get away with it.\n\n36:58.840 --> 37:02.840\nThere would be no profit in it, so that would be stupid\n\n37:02.840 --> 37:04.880\nto kill us, and then the thing that started freaking me out\n\n37:04.880 --> 37:07.360\nwas like, who says criminals aren't stupid?\n\n37:07.360 --> 37:10.280\nLike, what if it's his first murder?\n\n37:10.280 --> 37:11.880\nDid that happen all the time?\n\n37:11.880 --> 37:15.240\nThe prisons are overflowing with bad murderers.\n\n37:15.240 --> 37:16.200\nThey're just bad at it.\n\n37:16.200 --> 37:16.960\nThey're just dumb.\n\n37:16.960 --> 37:19.200\nThey're just like, I'm going to try killing a bunch of people\n\n37:19.200 --> 37:21.400\nand see if that will make me a bunch of money.\n\n37:21.400 --> 37:25.080\nAnd they're wrong, but that's of no comfort to the victims.\n\n37:25.080 --> 37:30.000\nAnyways, what I never bothered to think during the entire car\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:34.560\nride was, oh, we're not going to die, because man is good.\n\n37:34.560 --> 37:36.960\nIt's actually all that stuff that you are always\n\n37:36.960 --> 37:39.880\nrunning your mouth about as a hippie, and a liberal,\n\n37:39.880 --> 37:44.200\nand a nerd, and it's like, oh, all that stuff is actually\n\n37:44.200 --> 37:46.400\ntrue, and if there's an island small enough,\n\n37:46.400 --> 37:48.320\nyou'll find that out, because there's like a million people\n\n37:48.320 --> 37:52.120\nthat live there, and they're just like happy and don't really,\n\n37:52.120 --> 37:55.400\nthey don't fucking think about murdering people all the time.\n\n37:55.400 --> 37:57.120\nIt's just not something that runs through their head,\n\n37:57.120 --> 37:58.680\nso they're neither good nor bad at it,\n\n37:58.680 --> 38:00.560\nnor do they ever think to even bother to say,\n\n38:00.560 --> 38:02.360\nby the way, I know this looks like a murderer car,\n\n38:02.360 --> 38:04.160\nbut they wouldn't think that.\n\n38:04.160 --> 38:06.000\nThey wouldn't be like looking at their car and going,\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:09.920\nlike, come on, Jacob, make it look less murdery.\n\n38:09.920 --> 38:11.760\nSpray the hubcaps a little.\n\n38:11.760 --> 38:13.200\nThere's murder dust on them.\n\n38:13.200 --> 38:20.200\nThe, you know, murdery, so like, I never thought about that.\n\n38:21.360 --> 38:25.240\nThe weird thing is how convinced I was that I was gonna die,\n\n38:25.240 --> 38:28.880\nand how specific my map of the universe was,\n\n38:28.880 --> 38:30.520\nhow definite it was.\n\n38:30.520 --> 38:35.120\nThe really weird thing is that how it took eight seconds\n\n38:35.120 --> 38:40.120\nfor it to go completely away, and that how comfortable\n\n38:40.440 --> 38:42.520\nI was with being that wrong.\n\n38:42.520 --> 38:45.200\nHow I immediately then was like, oh yeah, yeah,\n\n38:45.200 --> 38:48.320\nthen there's that other version of the universe,\n\n38:48.320 --> 38:51.320\nthat you're also 100% convinced is real.\n\n38:51.320 --> 38:54.280\nWhere shit bad shit doesn't happen, you just have,\n\n38:54.280 --> 38:56.840\nyou know, that was the weird thing about the experience,\n\n38:56.840 --> 39:00.200\nwas like looking within myself and going like,\n\n39:00.200 --> 39:02.280\nwait, do I even have a brain?\n\n39:02.280 --> 39:03.520\nDo I even have an identity?\n\n39:03.520 --> 39:04.640\nDo I have a point of view?\n\n39:04.640 --> 39:07.640\nLike, is this country just like,\n\n39:07.640 --> 39:12.240\nare we just like unimprinted, unindulcturated drones,\n\n39:12.240 --> 39:17.240\nthat are like, spit out of like a little metal dish?\n\n39:19.360 --> 39:24.000\nAnd I'm like, we're kind of like-\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:25.800\nYou started a show calling me drunk.\n\n39:27.080 --> 39:29.680\nWe're kind of intentionally,\n\n39:29.680 --> 39:32.240\nI didn't know drunk was an insult to you.\n\n39:32.240 --> 39:35.560\nI have a scratchy voice, and I'm being inarticulate.\n\n39:35.560 --> 39:36.400\nAll right, well.\n\n39:36.400 --> 39:37.880\nI was just making a joke to you, man.\n\n39:37.880 --> 39:39.600\nI've said it on stage before, like, hey man,\n\n39:39.600 --> 39:40.440\nare you drunk?\n\n39:40.440 --> 39:42.000\nAnd sometimes you've been like, you bit your tits.\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:44.000\nLike, I just thought it was,\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:49.000\nI didn't know, I didn't know, man.\n\n39:49.400 --> 39:54.400\nAll right, so, they sang us a song.\n\n39:54.400 --> 39:55.840\nIt was an amazing night, like this guy.\n\n39:55.840 --> 39:58.120\nWait, what's the song?\n\n39:58.120 --> 39:59.120\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n39:59.120 --> 40:00.400\nThey get up and sing a number?\n\n40:00.400 --> 40:01.920\nYeah, yeah, they sang us a song.\n\n40:01.920 --> 40:06.680\nI have the recording of it, but it was a great night.\n\n40:06.680 --> 40:09.280\nIt was like, some of the most valuable things\n\n40:09.280 --> 40:11.040\nthat I got from them, because it was like,\n\n40:11.040 --> 40:12.400\nagain, we started talking about politics,\n\n40:12.400 --> 40:13.720\nand they were like, yeah, like,\n\n40:13.720 --> 40:15.840\nit's not good here right now, like, politically,\n\n40:15.840 --> 40:19.840\nbut it's not a Fijian's job to deal with that shit.\n\n40:19.840 --> 40:21.240\nLike, we do what we're told.\n\n40:21.240 --> 40:22.880\nIt's like, just say this shit that, like,\n\n40:22.880 --> 40:24.400\nas Americans, we just go like,\n\n40:25.400 --> 40:26.720\nit's almost like you get mad at them.\n\n40:26.720 --> 40:27.800\nLike, you're like, fuck you.\n\n40:27.800 --> 40:32.320\nLike, it's like, we think you're a bad person\n\n40:32.320 --> 40:35.160\nif you don't figure out who to be mad at\n\n40:35.160 --> 40:36.680\nand what to do about it.\n\n40:36.680 --> 40:39.560\nAnd yet, we're not really getting anywhere with that.\n\n40:39.560 --> 40:43.480\nLike, and I'm not saying they're flying around like Jetsons.\n\n40:43.480 --> 40:48.480\nLike, they're not, they're living in plywood lean twos,\n\n40:48.680 --> 40:51.280\nand then they're saying things like,\n\n40:51.280 --> 40:53.600\nlike, when you say it's beautiful here,\n\n40:53.600 --> 40:54.520\nthey always say thank you.\n\n40:54.520 --> 40:55.560\nWould you say that if you were like,\n\n40:55.560 --> 40:57.560\nit's like, every Western kind of like,\n\n40:57.560 --> 40:58.840\ngo to London, and they go like,\n\n40:58.840 --> 41:00.960\nthat's beautiful here, and the Londoner goes like,\n\n41:00.960 --> 41:04.680\npfft, but they always go like, they go thank you.\n\n41:04.680 --> 41:08.560\nLike, you complimented them because they're very proud\n\n41:08.560 --> 41:12.200\nof how they live in paradise, and they all,\n\n41:12.200 --> 41:15.520\nlike they just do this thing, or they keep talking about,\n\n41:15.520 --> 41:17.880\nI don't know if it's a talking point that was like,\n\n41:17.880 --> 41:20.840\nsent down to everybody, or they keep going,\n\n41:20.840 --> 41:22.200\nbecause you hear it on the airplane,\n\n41:22.200 --> 41:23.720\nand then you hear it from the driver,\n\n41:23.720 --> 41:26.080\nand then you hear it, it just keeps coming up like,\n\n41:26.080 --> 41:27.640\nby the way, thank you so much.\n\n41:27.640 --> 41:30.560\nYour tourism dollars like, are really helpful here.\n\n41:30.560 --> 41:32.880\nThat's like, that's maybe 80% of their economy there.\n\n41:32.880 --> 41:35.920\nLike, they might have one or two agricultural products,\n\n41:35.920 --> 41:38.200\nand then tourism is the main revenue there.\n\n41:38.200 --> 41:41.120\nSo they're quite happy to have like, tourists there.\n\n41:41.120 --> 41:42.240\nYeah, because otherwise they'd be working\n\n41:42.240 --> 41:43.440\nin the sugar cane fields, as they say,\n\n41:43.440 --> 41:46.080\nbut it's like, that's still no reason to like,\n\n41:46.080 --> 41:48.880\nin my mind, to thank me, because as I explained to them,\n\n41:48.880 --> 41:50.120\nI'm like, I don't want to bum you out,\n\n41:50.120 --> 41:52.080\nbut you probably know I didn't come here\n\n41:52.080 --> 41:53.880\nto do you a favor.\n\n41:53.880 --> 41:55.840\nAlso, I thought most of you are murderers.\n\n41:55.840 --> 41:58.120\nYeah, I did tell them that, I mean,\n\n41:58.120 --> 41:59.840\nI've been telling them, yeah,\n\n41:59.840 --> 42:04.840\nbefore they murdered me, but they were so,\n\n42:04.840 --> 42:08.320\nyeah, and I don't know, they're just like, when you have troubles,\n\n42:08.320 --> 42:10.120\nlike they lift you up or something like that,\n\n42:10.120 --> 42:11.720\nI can't remember it, I should have written it down,\n\n42:11.720 --> 42:14.360\nbut they said something really inspiring.\n\n42:15.640 --> 42:16.480\nAnd then they,\n\n42:17.840 --> 42:19.960\nthey said, it's all about the people,\n\n42:19.960 --> 42:21.480\nand it's all about how you react to things.\n\n42:21.480 --> 42:23.480\nYou know, like, if you're having a shitty time,\n\n42:23.480 --> 42:25.400\nif you're as a culture, as a tribe, as a village,\n\n42:25.400 --> 42:30.040\nas a country, like, it's, the thing that defines you\n\n42:30.040 --> 42:33.120\nis not whether you fight it, whether you don't,\n\n42:33.120 --> 42:35.320\nwhether you say something right or wrong,\n\n42:35.320 --> 42:39.000\nit's just how you face that thing,\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:42.640\nlike who you are when you either go down or prevail,\n\n42:42.640 --> 42:47.040\nlike, and the way to make sure you're on the right side\n\n42:47.040 --> 42:49.520\nof everything is to side with people.\n\n42:49.520 --> 42:51.560\nIt's starting with your family,\n\n42:51.560 --> 42:54.600\nthen very close second, your entire village,\n\n42:54.600 --> 42:55.920\nbecause they are your family,\n\n42:55.920 --> 43:00.520\nand then your entire species is a close third,\n\n43:00.520 --> 43:02.000\nif not tied for second,\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:03.600\nand if that means that bad guys\n\n43:03.600 --> 43:04.960\nare gonna take advantage of you and say,\n\n43:04.960 --> 43:07.400\noh, now we own this, and you get to live in a tire swing,\n\n43:07.400 --> 43:10.880\nwell, okay, then that's what they do.\n\n43:10.880 --> 43:13.560\nAnd it's like, it's not like, oh, let's all go do that,\n\n43:13.560 --> 43:16.760\nlike, I think, you know, but it was also like,\n\n43:16.760 --> 43:19.240\noh, geez, like, there's really,\n\n43:19.240 --> 43:20.680\nthere's really only one wrong way\n\n43:20.680 --> 43:22.760\nto handle what we're dealing with right now,\n\n43:22.760 --> 43:24.760\nin this time, in our world,\n\n43:24.760 --> 43:29.760\nand that's to be, like, to let them make us pissy,\n\n43:29.760 --> 43:33.160\nlike, while we're going down or up.\n\n43:33.160 --> 43:35.080\nLike, if whether we win or lose,\n\n43:35.080 --> 43:38.200\nif we got too fucking uncharismatic\n\n43:38.200 --> 43:39.120\nwhile we were doing it,\n\n43:39.120 --> 43:41.440\nlike, then they would have won that victory too,\n\n43:41.440 --> 43:42.320\nand it's like, just sucks,\n\n43:42.320 --> 43:47.240\nbecause you just get the sense that a big part of this war\n\n43:47.240 -->

opponent of all\n\n44:08.880 --> 44:10.880\nif we continue to be surprised\n\n44:10.880 --> 44:12.320\nthat they won't listen to reason,\n\n44:12.320 --> 44:13.920\nif we continue, we just gotta like,\n\n44:13.920 --> 44:14.760\nlook at this as like,\n\n44:14.760 --> 44:17.000\nthere's a fucking werewolf in our house,\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:18.680\nis it, or is it something like,\n\n44:18.680

44:39.160\nbut I just know that like,\n\n44:39.160 --> 44:41.040\nthis is death staring us in the face,\n\n44:41.040 --> 44:44.840\nand like, you know, we may be two inches\n\n44:44.840 --> 44:46.400\nfrom our flipper touching sand,\n\n44:47.840 --> 44:51.640\nor we may have just swam into the Baltic on accident,\n\n44:51.640 --> 44:54.320\nand this is it, but in either

supposed to be\n\n45:27.680 --> 45:31.080\nlike the fucking like, sin of all sins,\n\n45:31.080 --> 45:33.840\nlike not, oh, it's like, it's like,\n\n45:33.840 --> 45:35.280\nit's like, you know, like

journalist got shot, you know,\n\n45:43.080 --> 45:45.360\nlike, like, so one of the gang, gang families,\n\n45:45.360 --> 45:46.760\nlike they just, they didn't like\n\n45:46.760 --> 45:48.240\nhow they got written about by,\n\n45:48.240 --> 45:49.800\nand there wasn't even, journalism wasn't even like\n\n45:49.800 --> 45:52.600\nin its peak form back then,\n\n45:52.600 --> 45:54.240\nit was almost worse than now,\n\n45:54.240 --> 45:58.000\nbut still it was like, hey, you don't do that,\n\n45:58.000 --> 45:59.720\nyou don't fucking like, shoot a guy\n\n45:59.720 --> 46:01.080\nthat writes for a newspaper\n\n46:01.080 --> 46:03.240\nbecause you're having a disagreement with here,\n\n46:03.240 --> 46:04.840\nbut now we're just like, fuck it,\n\n46:04.840 --> 46:06.800\nlike, Putin just fucking murders,\n\n46:06.800 --> 46:08.560\njust look it up, look at the list of people\n\n46:08.560 --> 46:09.720\nthat he's just murders, he's just orders.\n\n46:09.720 --> 46:12.440\nHis day job was the KGB, those were the people\n\n46:12.440 --> 46:13.680\nthat pulled you out of your house\n\n46:13.680 --> 46:16.960\nand shot you in the head, like that was his day job.\n\n46:16.960 -->

gonna fucking die.\n\n46:38.120 --> 46:40.120\nIt's just different from like the Richard Lewis,\n\n46:40.120 --> 46:42.040\nwe're gonna die, you know, like, like,\n\n46:42.040 --> 46:43.400\nwe don't need Richard Lewis right now,\n\n46:43.400 --> 46:46.840\nwe need, we need Bill Gates.\n\n46:46.840 --> 46:49.000\nRichard Lewis was a comedian back in the 80s,\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:52.680\nvery neurotic, he panicked a lot.\n\n46:53.680 --> 46:55.200\nBut I'm not saying he's a bad person\n\n46:55.200 --> 46:58.280\nif he wants to come on the show and talk about it.\n\n46:58.280 --> 46:59.200\nI love Richard Lewis.\n\n46:59.200 --> 47:01.440\nI just mean, as far as our spirit animals are concerned,\n\n47:01.440 --> 47:03.120\nwe need to go with more of a...\n\n47:03.120 --> 47:07.080\nMore of a, what's the comic that we should be going for?\n\n47:07.080 --> 47:10.240\nI think Ancia, I don't know.\n\n47:10.240 --> 47:11.480\nYeah.\n\n47:11.480 --> 47:12.480\nI don't

grumbling.\n\n47:22.440 --> 47:25.120\nI mean, like, there's, how about this,\n\n47:25.120 --> 47:26.680\nthere's no, there are no heroes,\n\n47:26.680 --> 47:31.680\nlike we're, let the other team think that the idea\n\n47:32.960 --> 47:34.480\nis that you need a perfect quarterback\n\n47:34.480 --> 47:36.080\nand then your team can win all that stuff.\n\n47:36.080 --> 47:37.920\nI think the thing that they resent about us\n\n47:37.920 --> 47:39.600\nis that they think that we're like a sexless,\n\n47:39.600 --> 47:43.360\nraceless, hoard, a bored cube that's gonna swallow them up.\n\n47:43.360 --> 47:45.200\nLet's just let them be right about that\n\n47:45.200 --> 47:49.080\nand stop waiting for some like fucking superhuman Tom Cruisey\n\n47:49.080 --> 47:52.200\nbut not offensively Tom Cruisey guy to lead us all\n\n47:52.200 --> 47:55.320\nbecause it's like, let's just be a committee,\n\n47:55.320 --> 47:56.680\nlike, which is what they've always feared\n\n47:56.680 --> 47:57.800\nand what I've always resisted,\n\n47:57.800 --> 48:00.600\nbut let's just have common sense and be like, yeah,\n\n48:00.600 --> 48:03.120\nit's hard to be a throng of people\n\n48:03.120 --> 48:06.560\nthat tries to make sure that everybody is relatively safe.\n\n48:06.560 --> 48:08.520\nIt looks a little bit like this.\n\n48:08.520 --> 48:11.040\nIt doesn't look like Bill Pullman's speech\n\n48:11.040 --> 48:12.200\nin Independence Day.\n\n48:12.200 --> 48:14.600\nThat doesn't work in real life though.\n\n48:14.600 --> 48:16.520\nLike, if you want to save the economy\n\n48:16.520 --> 48:18.840\nand the ecology and the equality,\n\n48:18.840 --> 48:21.720\nyou have to like actually just spread it out\n\n48:21.720 --> 48:24.120\nand run things by relative commission.\n\n48:24.120 --> 48:24.960\nWhat am I talking about?\n\n48:24.960 --> 48:29.960\nAll right, so they sang this song and Cody recorded it.\n\n48:34.720 --> 48:36.800\nThis is the ending of the song.\n\n48:36.800 --> 48:37.960\nIt's this beautiful, you know,\n\n48:37.960 --> 48:39.240\nthey say like, when you sing this song,\n\n48:39.240 --> 48:40.280\nthey have this whole preamble.\n\n48:40.280 --> 48:41.560\nYeah, paint the picture.\n\n48:41.560 --> 48:43.240\nYou're in somebody's home right now?\n\n48:43.240 --> 48:46.880\nYeah, it's like, just imagine like really like the poorest,\n\n48:46.880 --> 48:50.160\nlike, we're sitting on the floor,\n\n48:50.160 --> 48:51.920\nthere's like, and on the floor, there's like that.\n\n48:51.920 --> 48:53.200\nI'm getting notes from Levy.\n\n48:53.200 --> 48:54.200\nLevy was there too?\n\n48:54.200 --> 48:56.040\nYeah, yeah.\n\n48:56.040 --> 48:58.440\nLevy, come out, do you want to come out and...\n\n48:58.440 -->

there,\n\n49:17.320 --> 49:19.560\nI turned to Cody and I whispered to her,\n\n49:19.560 --> 49:22.320\nI was like, I'm so scared.\n\n49:22.320 --> 49:23.400\nShe was like, don't be.\n\n49:23.400 --> 49:25.120\nBut I was like, look at Dan.\n\n49:25.120 --> 49:27.960\nHe, Dan, Dan was like this.\n\n49:33.480 --> 49:34.680\nSee Dan, I always thought of you\n\n49:34.680 --> 49:37.680\nas a very intrepid adventurer and voyager.\n\n49:37.680 --> 49:42.160\nYeah, I mean, I'm a real thrill seeker\n\n49:42.160 --> 49:44.440\nwhen it comes to what I eat and drink.\n\n49:44.440 --> 49:48.480\nIt was a pretty incredible experience.\n\n49:48.480 --> 49:53.400\nI was terrified, the whole waiting for them to come\n\n49:53.400 --> 49:56.520\nand then the exchange and then getting in the car\n\n49:56.520 --> 49:59.320\nand driving into the middle of nowhere.\n\n49:59.320 --> 50:02.520\nOkay, so then they go, so we have a great time.\n\n50:02.520 --> 50:03.360\nYou're sitting on the...\n\n50:03.360 --> 50:04.960\nYeah, they walked us through the village\n\n50:04.960 --> 50:06.840\nand it was, there were no lights,\n\n50:06.840 --> 50:07.880\nso there's no light pollution.\n\n50:07.880 --> 50:09.840\nAnd it was, you've never seen stars like this\n\n50:09.840 --> 50:10.880\nin your entire life.\n\n50:10.880 --> 50:12.680\nYou literally haven't because we're in a different part\n\n50:12.680 --> 50:14.560\nof the planet where you can't even see the Big Dipper.\n\n50:14.560 --> 50:15.520\nIt's a different constellation.\n\n50:15.520 --> 50:17.960\nYeah, yeah, you're seeing different stars, which is awesome.\n\n50:17.960 --> 50:19.480\nThey call it the Big Dipper.\n\n50:20.480 --> 50:22.840\nThey have a medium sized Dipper over there.\n\n50:24.840 --> 50:26.680\nWe've been looking for it forever.\n\n50:26.680 --> 50:27.520\nAwesome.\n\n50:27.520 --> 50:29.800\nAlso, they tore apart our cosmic kitchen.\n\n50:29.800 --> 50:31.080\nThey have one constellation.\n\n50:31.080 --> 50:32.480\nWhere's our medium Dipper?\n\n50:32.480 --> 50:36.920\nThere's one constellation called Orion's Bracelets.\n\n50:38.920 --> 50:42.280\nIt's good, this fucking belt is useless with that.\n\n50:42.280 --> 50:44.280\nWhere am I Orion's Bracelet?\n\n50:46.280 --> 50:49.800\nWhere's Orion's personal good that I bought with that belt?\n\n50:51.200 --> 50:52.400\nThe whole point of it.\n\n50:54.600 --> 50:58.480\nSo, yeah, it's like a thatched, like what do you,\n\n50:58.480 --> 51:00.600\nthey have like a mat on the floor.\n\n51:00.600 --> 51:02.320\nIt was like a, yeah, it was like what?\n\n51:02.320 --> 51:03.800\nI don't think they probably roll out for company.\n\n51:03.800 --> 51:04.880\nA reed mat, maybe?\n\n51:04.880 --> 51:06.080\nYeah, yeah.\n\n51:06.080 --> 51:08.080\nAnd they, there are a lot of bugs everywhere.\n\n51:08.080 --> 51:09.600\nThere's big cockroaches.\n\n51:09.600 --> 51:12.200\nLizards, lizards crawling on the walls.\n\n51:12.200 --> 51:14.320\nAnd there was an American flag on the wall.\n\n51:14.320 --> 51:16.280\nWe're like, why is that there?\n\n51:16.280 --> 51:17.920\nAnd they're like, we heard you were coming.\n\n51:17.920 --> 51:21.640\nWe're actually a, it was a joke though.\n\n51:21.640 --> 51:24.560\nWe were the first Americans that they'd had in there.\n\n51:24.560 --> 51:28.360\nIt's usually Australians that they entreat to this.\n\n51:28.360 --> 51:31.600\nBut, so why is the, what's that American flag up there?\n\n51:31.600 --> 51:32.880\nAnd they'd made the joke of like,\n\n51:32.880 --> 51:33.720\noh, you're expecting it?\n\n51:33.720 --> 51:35.040\nAnd we're like, no, come on.\n\n51:35.040 --> 51:36.440\nAnd they're like, no, one of their,\n\n51:36.440 --> 51:40.080\nhis cousin was in the Fijian Navy,\n\n51:41.200 --> 51:43.840\nwhich is just, it's those four kids\n\n51:43.840 --> 51:45.640\nwho are laughing at me about the crab.\n\n51:45.640 --> 51:50.640\nI kid Fiji's Navy because I'm safe.\n\n51:52.520 --> 51:56.320\nThe, but no, in the Fiji military,\n\n51:56.320 --> 51:57.320\nI think the Navy, I assume,\n\n51:57.320 --> 52:02.320\nand then there was like a, she met an American Navy guy\n\n52:03.560 --> 52:05.720\nand he gave her an American flag\n\n52:05.720 --> 52:07.320\nand she gave him a Fiji flag\n\n52:07.320 --> 52:09.920\nand he's hanging her Fiji flag at his apartment.\n\n52:09.920 --> 52:10.760\nAnd they have it.\n\n52:10.760 --> 52:11.600\nIt was very nice.\n\n52:11.600 --> 52:12.920\nA lot of stuff like that where it was just like,\n\n52:12.920 --> 52:13.840\nthis is fucking beautiful.\n\n52:13.840 --> 52:16.720\nAnd we drank this like mud water that's like,\n\n52:16.720 --> 52:19.560\nthey're, they

want to see the village,\n\n52:25.440 --> 52:26.880\nbut they said at the hotel, it's like,\n\n52:26.880 --> 52:28.760\nyeah, this, the cover that we have here\n\n52:28.760 --> 52:31.520\nis just kind of like the industrial, like it,\n\n52:31.520 --> 52:32.360\nit's watered down.\n\n52:32.360 --> 52:33.680\nI think you can buy this stuff at Greenwich Village.\n\n52:33.680 --> 52:36.200\nIt's a relative of the chili plant, but it's like,\n\n52:36.200 --> 52:37.960\nI think you might get your head cut off there\n\n52:37.960 --> 52:38.800\nfor smoking weed.\n\n52:38.800 --> 52:39.840\nSo maybe they're like lightweights.\n\n52:39.840 --> 52:41.520\nI don't know, but they, they're like,\n\n52:41.520 --> 52:43.360\nit was like, you think it was ayahuasca\n\n52:43.360 --> 52:44.720\nthe way they talked about it?\n\n52:44.720 --> 52:45.560\nBut, and then you drink it\n\n52:45.560 --> 52:47.160\nand you're like, ah, tastes like dirt.\n\n52:47.160 --> 52:48.360\nAnd then you drink a bunch of cheap beer\n\n52:48.360 --> 52:49.360\nuntil you get drunk.\n\n52:49.360 --> 52:50.200\nUh.\n\n52:50.200 --> 52:54.000\nHow many people are in this room?\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:55.880\nUh, like

wrong?\n\n53:01.320 --> 53:02.680\nThis is the most adorable little girl\n\n53:02.680 --> 53:03.520\nyou've ever seen in your life.\n\n53:03.520 --> 53:04.600\nSteve took some great pictures\n\n53:04.600 --> 53:06.680\nwhere he had his big ass camera.\n\n53:06.680 --> 53:09.160\nAll the kids are like walking around with giant iPhone,\n\n53:09.160 --> 53:10.320\ngiant relative to their bodies,\n\n53:10.320 --> 53:12.360\ngiant iPhones staring at the screens\n\n53:12.360 --> 53:15.120\nand like, like, like dogs running around.\n\n53:16.120 --> 53:17.520\nAll right, so, so then they go,\n\n53:17.520 --> 53:19.040\nokay, so before you go,\n\n53:21.640 --> 53:22.560\nwe sing this song.\n\n53:22.560 --> 53:24.600\nIt's like, and then it's an ancient tradition\n\n53:24.600 --> 53:28.040\nand like, like, like, like in Fiji, everyone, you know,\n\n53:28.040 --> 53:30.600\nthere's no, like fences are offensive.\n\n53:30.600 --> 53:31.520\nOh, I like that.\n\n53:31.520 -->

was a song like-\n\n53:43.640 --> 53:45.360\nInvented the alphabet.\n\n53:46.400 --> 53:50.480\nIt was a song essentially celebrating the men's life\n\n53:50.480 --> 53:54.400\nand thanking them for, for their going to war,\n\n53:54.400 --> 53:56.200\nbut also for giving them whatever-\n\n53:56.200 --> 53:57.200\nYou really paid attention.\n\n53:57.200 --> 53:58.040\nYeah, well-\n\n53:58.040 -->

it's like, it's, it's gorgeous.\n\n54:12.840 --> 54:14.840\nIt sounds like a Paul Simon album and-\n\n54:14.840 --> 54:16.120\nThey all harmonized.\n\n54:16.120 --> 54:17.760\nLike it was just like built in.\n\n54:17.760 --> 54:19.520\nSome of them are just on Instagram\n\n54:19.520 --> 54:20.520\nand like kind of giggling.\n\n54:20.520 --> 54:24.120\nIs this pre-Cava, during-Cava or

met on the podcast,\n\n54:33.120 --> 54:35.960\nmy high school friend Dave Frito was there.\n\n54:35.960 --> 54:38.400\nComey, Cody, Steve Levy and Frito.\n\n54:38.400 --> 54:39.360\nSo then they sing this song\n\n54:39.360 --> 54:40.880\nand so then we'll move on from Fiji,\n\n54:40.880 --> 54:43.480\nbut let's see.\n\n54:43.480 --> 54:46.440\nAnd so you'll hear trains in the background and cars.\n\n54:46.440 --> 54:48.920\nThese guys are wearing like soccer jerseys\n\n54:48.920 --> 54:50.560\nand Britney Spears concert shirts.\n\n54:50.560 --> 54:53.760\nIt's like, it's, it's not, there's not like a pretense\n\n54:53.760 --> 54:55.920\nin that culture of like, we're one with nature.\n\n54:55.920 --> 54:58.280\nIt's just, it's, they live in paradise.\n\n54:58.280 --> 54:59.600\nThey live in poverty.\n\n54:59.600 --> 55:02.240\nThey love that they get to go work at a resort\n\n55:02.240 --> 55:03.520\ninstead of a sugar cane field.\n\n55:03.520 --> 55:05.280\nBut there's like no, and they're not like,\n\n55:05.280 --> 55:06.960\ndon't take pictures and don't do any of that.\n\n55:06.960 --> 55:08.360\nIt's just like, it was kind of a weird thing\n\n55:08.360 --> 55:09.200\nto wrap my brain around.\n\n55:09.200 --> 55:10.800\nIt wasn't like, like, you talk to other people\n\n55:10.800 --> 55:12.200\nthat go like, oh, I went to the Serengeti\n\n55:12.200 --> 55:14.720\nand they made a, I took out my phone and they said,\n\n55:14.720 --> 55:16.720\nah, ah, ah, and they made a phone out of a tree.\n\n55:16.720 --> 55:18.000\nAnd then they're like, this is our phone.\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:20.600\nAnd like, the sun came down.\n\n55:20.600 --> 55:22.240\nAnd it's like, you're not allowed to have aluminum there\n\n55:22.240 --> 55:24.520\nbecause it was, but this isn't like that.\n\n55:24.520 --> 55:26.480\nIt was just like, so you just hear these guys,\n\n55:26.480 --> 55:28.800\nyou hear like a freeway and a train and stuff like that.\n\n55:28.800 --> 55:29.880\nAnd they're like trying to harmonize.\n\n55:29.880 --> 55:31.920\nBut then, then there's a part of the song\n\n55:31.920 --> 55:32.960\nthat I wanted you to hear.\n\n55:32.960 --> 55:33.920\nAh, let's see what it is.\n\n55:33.920 --> 55:54.560\nThat's the name of the hotel.\n\n55:54.560 --> 56:13.520\nI'm like, did they just say, that's the name.\n\n56:13.520 --> 56:16.440\nSo beautiful, so beautiful.\n\n56:16.440 --> 56:19.840\nCouldn't help but notice an advertisement in there\n\n56:19.840 --> 56:22.360\nfor the hotel we're staying at.\n\n56:22.360 --> 56:25.000\nAnd they said, oh, well, that's the part of the song\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:28.800\nwhere you talk about the place where we met.\n\n56:28.800 --> 56:31.640\nI don't know, they explained it in a way that made me go,\n\n56:31.640 --> 56:34.520\noh, once again, I'm the asshole.\n\n56:34.520 --> 56:35.960\nIt's not integrated marketing.\n\n56:35.960 --> 56:41.560\nIt's just like, it's them allowing the first-world way\n\n56:41.560 --> 56:45.000\nof things to be incorporated into how they've always\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:46.400\ndone stuff.\n\n56:46.400 --> 56:47.720\nDid they give you like a name?\n\n56:47.720 --> 56:51.000\nDid they give you like a special name for like your?\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:52.080\nThey made me the chief.\n\n56:52.080 --> 56:54.400\nThey said I was the chief.\n\n56:54.400 --> 56:56.360\nBefore we started doing Kava, you have to,\n\n56:56.360 --> 57:00.200\nbecause we're the new tribe coming in to be like,\n\n57:00.200 --> 57:02.560\nthe Kava ceremonies, it's like they welcome you\n\n57:02.560 --> 57:05.960\ninto their village.\n\n57:05.960 --> 57:08.200\nAnd you have to have a chief.\n\n57:08.200 --> 57:13.080\nAnd they, to start the, they drink, it's one for one.\n\n57:13.080 --> 57:16.400\nSo someone, their chief drinks, then your chief drinks,\n\n57:16.400 --> 57:18.480\nand then back and forth between all of them.\n\n57:18.480 --> 57:19.920\nAnd then their chief's assistant drinks,\n\n57:19.920 --> 57:21.320\nthen Steve Levy drinks.\n\n57:21.320 --> 57:22.120\nYeah.\n\n57:22.120 --> 57:23.680\nOh, and they love Big Bang Theory.\n\n57:23.680 --> 57:26.880\nThey fucking love it.\n\n57:26.880 --> 57:29.720\nThey brought up television, and I was just like,\n\n57:29.720 --> 57:31.280\nI just sat and listened for a little bit.\n\n57:31.280 --> 57:34.040\nAnd they're like, yeah, we like, I don't know.\n\n57:34.040 --> 57:35.280\nBecause they're playing music.\n\n57:35.280 --> 57:38.520\nThey play some, they play like, you guys like Marvin Gaye.\n\n57:38.520 --> 57:40.720\nLike, here's how far they are.\n\n57:40.720 --> 57:43.120\nIt's like, like, we told them we're from Los Angeles,\n\n57:43.120 --> 57:47.560\nand they're like, oh, Elvis, like Elvis, Casino's.\n\n57:47.560 --> 57:48.840\nAnd they're like, no, that's Las Vegas.\n\n57:48.840 --> 57:51.520\nBut it's like, it's kind of neat perspective.\n\n57:51.520 --> 57:53.880\nOr you're like, oh, yeah, it's just like, yeah, the word is.\n\n57:53.880 --> 57:57.400\nAnd it's like, Elvis isn't not from Los Angeles.\n\n57:57.400 --> 58:00.520\nBut anyways, but they were like, just talking about stuff.\n\n58:00.520 --> 58:02.080\nBecause it's like, they all have iPhones.\n\n58:02.080 --> 58:03.720\nThere was one dude who never got off his iPhone.\n\n58:03.720 --> 58:04.360\nHe's a teenager.\n\n58:04.360 --> 58:06.760\nHe's probably like, like, hitting on somebody,\n\n58:06.760 --> 58:09.440\nor like, he's caught up in his stuff.\n\n58:09.440 --> 58:13.160\nBut the, and so they're like, talking about like, the TV\n\n58:13.160 --> 58:14.600\nshows that they watch, and what we watch,\n\n58:14.600 --> 58:15.080\nand all this stuff.\n\n58:15.080 --> 58:16.880\nAnd then I was like, you guys like Big Bang Theory.\n\n58:16.880 --> 58:20.640\nAnd I was like, I can room lit up like, what are they laughing\n\n58:20.640 -->

--> 58:34.240\nIf Fijian people love that show, I'm just, I quit.\n\n58:34.240 --> 58:35.920\nI'm not saying because it doesn't deserve it.\n\n58:35.920 --> 58:37.680\nI'm saying like, I don't understand.\n\n58:37.680 --> 58:39.800\nLike, he's just a magician.\n\n58:39.800 --> 58:43.200\nHe just like, cast a magic spell on the planet.\n\n58:43.200 --> 58:46.400\nThey're watching Big Bang Theory and Fiji right now.\n\n58:46.400 --> 58:49.840\nFuck, fuck you.\n\n58:49.840 --> 58:51.120\nI could have been retired.\n\n58:51.120 --> 58:54.160\nLike, I promise if I hit that chat bar,\n\n58:54.160 --> 58:55.360\nyou won't hear from me anymore.\n\n58:55.360 --> 58:56.120\nI'll go away.\n\n58:56.120 --> 58:59.120\nI promise.\n\n58:59.120 --> 59:01.000\nGod damn it.\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:02.840\nThere's no Lorre town.\n\n59:02.840 --> 59:05.680\nFijian television was weird.\n\n59:05.680 --> 59:06.320\nWhat's that?\n\n59:06.320 --> 59:08.080\nFijian television was strange.\n\n59:08.080 --> 59:11.080\nWe fell in love with one particular channel.\n\n59:11.080 --> 59:12.440\nThe Pyramot channel.\n\n59:12.440 --> 59:15.280\nBut before we left the house, this is the saddest fucking thing.\n\n59:15.280 --> 59:20.240\nAnd as I often ask you, and which you never really\n\n59:20.240 --> 59:24.160\ndo me the honor of, but whatever, we're stuck together.\n\n59:24.160 --> 59:26.760\nBut I always say, will you please value my candor?\n\n59:26.760 --> 59:28.120\nI'm confessing something to you.\n\n59:28.120 --> 59:32.080\nI could whitewash myself like in my stories.\n\n59:32.080 --> 59:32.800\nBut I don't.\n\n59:32.800 --> 59:35.800\nI tell you guys the monster I am.\n\n59:35.800 --> 59:37.360\nAnd you still boo me.\n\n59:37.360 --> 59:40.320\nBut everybody left but me.\n\n59:40.320 --> 59:41.800\nI was the last person in the doorway.\n\n59:41.800 --> 59:43.320\nYou guys were all going in the car.\n\n59:43.320 --> 59:47.360\nIt's just high on this mud water and this cheap beer\n\n59:47.360 --> 59:48.840\nand just on life.\n\n59:48.840 --> 59:50.400\nAnd probably Cody brought her vape pen.\n\n59:50.400 --> 59:54.320\nAnd everyone's teetering into the car.\n\n59:54.320 --> 59:58.400\nAnd by the way, these guys never asked for a dollar.\n\n59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.320\nThere was never even any like, oh, let's\n\n01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.840\ntake a Polaroid together at the top of the Kava ceremony.\n\n01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.320\nAnd then on the way out, there's a rack of them.\n\n01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.360\nAnd they're like, would you like one?\n\n01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.640\nIt's $80.\n\n01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.280\nThere was never any angle with the possible exception\n\n01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:14.760\nof they like Kava and we bought them a bunch.\n\n01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:15.720\nThere was no angle.\n\n01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.040\nThere was no capitalism to it.\n\n01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.320\nBut that's a different matter.\n\n01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.440\nBut everybody else gets leaves.\n\n01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.360\nAnd I'm in the doorway.\n\n01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.080\nAnd the only person left is the elder who's\n\n01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.920\nlike 25 of the village, the guy who administered everything\n\n01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.600\nand who did all of the talking.\n\n01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.000\nHe was like the lead singer of PM Don.\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.960\nHe had like a very like just radiant kind of like soft\n\n01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.840\nbut firm like kind of like spiritual power to him\n\n01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.720\nand a big bowl of mud water in front of him.\n\n01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.520\nAnd he just like he'd lock eyes with me and just explain things\n\n01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.680\nand go like, what you're about to drink?\n\n01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.400\nIt's called the Kava root.\n\n01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.360\nKava root, as I say, the Fijian people.\n\n01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.680\nWe cannot escape this.\n\n01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.680\nThis is who we are.\n\n01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.000\nWe must drink this.\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.200\nNow you will drink it.\n\n01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.240\nWe will be family now.\n\n01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:05.440\nAnd all that kind of style is really cool.\n\n01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.840\nBut at the same get up, and it's just\n\n01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.400\nhim sitting across like on the floor in front\n\n01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.440\nof his bowl of magic water and everybody else\n\n01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.000\nto get in the car.\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.080\nAnd I turn, and I go to the door, and I go,\n\n01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:19.080\nI made a show called Community.\n\n01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.560\nNo!\n\n01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.760\nNo!\n\n01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.560\nIndy, start the plane!\n\n01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.640\nStart the plane, Indy!\n\n01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.400\nAnd he goes, what?\n\n01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.400\nAnd I made a show called Community.\n\n01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.400\nIt's not as popular as Big Bang Theory.\n\n01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.400\nIf you have Hulu or something.\n\n01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.400\nThis is Joel McKayles at Community College.\n\n01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.400\nAnd I just thought, I mean, I made some other stuff.\n\n01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.400\nTaylor's a Rick and Morty.\n\n01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:02.400\nAnd he's like, I'll check it out.\n\n01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.400\nBula, Bula, indeed.\n\n01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.400\nI was not put on this earth to inspire people\n\n01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.400\nwith my fucking wisdom or my...\n\n01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.400\nI admire your complete bravery in admitting that.\n\n01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.400\nThat's fucking, that's great.\n\n01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.400\nAnd you know why I did it.\n\n01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.400\nOn the off chance that he would have been like,\n\n01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.400\nThe John Wilder!\n\n01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.400\nYou know.\n\n01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.400\nIt's a reference to Romancing the Stone.\n\n01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.400\nThey go to a thing.\n\n01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.400\nYou want to meet my little mule?\n\n01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.400\nOh, I'd have to take my little mule.\n\n01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.400\nSo, wait, where was I?\n\n01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.400\nLeft of what the fuck?\n\n01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.400\nParamount Channel.\n\n01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.400\nParamount Channel shows all of Paramount's...\n\n01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.400\nIt's the offshore account of the Paramount network.\n\n01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.400\nIt's like their fault of their worst movies.\n\n01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.400\nHow do we still make money off of these things\n\n01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.400\nwe lost so much money on?\n\n01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.400\nThere was a movie playing called Turbulence\n\n01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.400\nwith Ray Liotta and Joe...\n\n01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.400\nWho was it?\n\n01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.400\nThe woman from Dumb and Dumber?\n\n01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.400\nYeah.\n\n01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.400\nJohn Wilder.\n\n01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.400\nYeah, Turbulence, check this movie out.\n\n01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.400\nI thought it was like fucking insanity.\n\n01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.400\nSpeaking of which, has anyone seen the accountant\n\n01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.400\nwith Ben Affleck?\n\n01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.400\nWhat in the fucking...\n\n01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.400\nWhat in the...\n\n01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.400\nTrying to take an end run around the Batman franchise?\n\n01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.400\nBy saying he's autistic?\n\n01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.400\nYou gotta watch that movie.\n\n01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.400\nIt goes up with one of those...\n\n01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:54.400\nLike, what's the one where...\n\n01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.400\nGhost World...\n\n01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.400\nJohansson, she's a space lady\n\n01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.400\nbecause she took the wrong kind of drug, Lucy.\n\n01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.400\nShe...\n\n01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.400\nAnd Morgan Freeman keeps narrating\n\n01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.400\nthe amount of brain she's using.\n\n01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.400\nAt 3%, you could make people float.\n\n01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.400\nAnd then she just makes them float.\n\n01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.400\nAnd I don't know, where are the steaks\n\n01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.400\ngoing to happen? And they never do.\n\n01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.400\nNever any steaks.\n\n01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.400\nThere's steaks in the first eight minutes of that movie,\n\n01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.400\nand the rest is her just going like,\n\n01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.400\nnow I can make you have bat wings.\n\n01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.400\nAnd nope, now I'm a computer.\n\n01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.400\nThink about it.\n\n01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.400\nPeace.\n\n01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.400\nBut that movie...\n\n01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.400\nThe accountant is a lot like that.\n\n01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.400\nAnd John Lithgow's in it and never disappoints.\n\n01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.400\nNever.\n\n01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.400\nWas that your Lithgow?\n\n01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.400\nThat's my Lithgow.\n\n01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.400\nThat's my Lithgow impression.\n\n01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:54.400\nYou have to keep your mouth a circle.\n\n01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.400\nIf you want to talk like Lithgow,\n\n01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.400\nyou have to keep your mouth a circle.\n\n01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:04.400\nLike a lamprey.\n\n01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:09.400\nHarry, get back over with the Henderson's.\n\n01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.400\nAnd John Lithgow.\n\n01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.400\nIt's impeccable.\n\n01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:18.400\nThere's a little bit of Jimmy Stewart going on in it.\n\n01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:23.400\nHarry, put those Christmas trees back on the law on the tree.\n\n01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:27.400\nNow you're doing Don Knotts.\n\n01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.400\nYou went Barney Fife.\n\n01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:33.400\nAndy, it is a wonderful life.\n\n01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:39.400\nI did not have relations with that woman.\n\n01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.400\nIt's Don Knotts Bill Clinton.\n\n01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.400\nIt goes with that, right?\n\n01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.400\nAnd it's a Popeye...\n\n01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:51.400\nI don't know.\n\n01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.400\nFor those of you who are wondering,\n\n01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.400\nDan, how do you do all those impressions?\n\n01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:01.400\nI have little tricks.\n\n01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.400\nLittle secrets.\n\n01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.400\nDoes anybody have a book on them or a magazine?\n\n01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.400\nLike anything with text?\n\n01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.400\nYou do?\n\n01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.400\nCan I see it?\n\n01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.400\nThe Party Game is the most terrifying Party Game of all time.\n\n01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.400\nWell, you pass it around in a circle.\n\n01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.400\nAnd so I'll pass it to Dan first.\n\n01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.400\nAnd what I do is...\n\n01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.400\nI'll give it to Dan.\n\n01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:25.400\nDan, you pick two sentences.\n\n01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.400\nAnywhere in the book.\n\n01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.400\nYou pick two sentences.\n\n01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.400\nThis book is a hurt talk.\n\n01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.400\nI'm a hurt talk.\n\n01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.400\nThat'll be good.\n\n01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.400\nYou pick two or three sentences.\n\n01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.400\nAnd then when Dan has selected his sentences,\n\n01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.400\nthen I give him an impression to do.\n\n01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:47.400\nHe has to read those sentences as that person.\n\n01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.400\nAnd you don't try to make him impossible.\n\n01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.400\nTry to do one that's possibly impressionable\n\n01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.400\nor impersonatable.\n\n01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.400\nSo when Dan, you're ready.\n\n01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.400\nOr just do hurt talk.\n\n01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.400\nToo easy, too easy.\n\n01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.400\nI mean, we could do it.\n\n01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.400\nYou want to start as hurt talk, Dan?\n\n01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.400\nMy hurt talk is like, it really comes and goes.\n\n01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.400\nI'll give you...\n\n01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.400\nSome accidents that occur...\n\n01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.400\nNo, you're doing Highlander.\n\n01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.400\nThat's Ren from Ren and Stimpy.\n\n01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.400\nYou're doing Christopher Lambert from Highlander.\n\n01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.400\nPeter Lorrie, Christopher Lambert,\n\n01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.400\nand Ren from Ren and Stimpy.\n\n01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.400\nYes, Stimpy.\n\n01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.400\nThere can be only one.\n\n01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.400\nThere can be only one, Stimpy.\n\n01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.400\nRick, you have to hide these documents.\n\n01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.400\nThere can be only one.\n\n01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.400\nYou despise me, don't you, Stimpy?\n\n01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.400\nYou have to hide me, Rick.\n\n01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.400\nYou have to hide me,

01:26:05.400\nand she's in her underwear and a t-shirt\n\n01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.400\nand she's doing the hula hoop game on the We Fit\n\n01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:09.400\nand then there's like a guy filming it\n\n01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:11.400\nand then the camera turns to him and he's like,\n\n01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.400\nand then it goes back.\n\n01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.400\nAnd then it went

scandal\n\n01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.400\nwhere it was like they were on the Nintendo\n\n01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:29.400\npayroll or something, right?\n\n01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.400\nThey didn't know about that.\n\n01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:33.400\nWell, maybe that even goes more to my point\n\n01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.400\nbecause whatever was scandalous about it,\n\n01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.400\nI remember there was like just something\n\n01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.400\nwhere it was just like, oh, did you know\n\n01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:41.400\nthat they got paid to do that or something like that?\n\n01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:43.400\nLike, I was explaining that to Cody today\n\n01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.400\nbecause she didn't know what the hell I was talking about\n\n01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.400\nand I was like, and then I stopped halfway through\n\n01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.400\nbecause she was like, that doesn't even seem like,\n\n01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.400\nwhy would that even be a wrong thing?\n\n01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.400\nWho cares if Nintendo gave you a bunch of money\n\n01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:55.400\nand then you successfully

yeah, you're right.\n\n01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.400\nThat would be absolutely high-fived now\n\n01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:05.400\nas just a piece of media that was successful\n\n01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:07.400\nin a time when it's hard to affect people.\n\n01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.400\nLike, and like,\n\n01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.400\nI just thought that was noteworthy\n\n01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.400\nthat we were still so innocent like eight years ago\n\n01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.400\nthat we, I remember people being like,\n\n01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.400\nyeah, but you hear that's

put\n\n01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:27.400\nparentheses around it.\n\n01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.400\nThat wasn't part of the duck thing.\n\n01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.400\nI don't, I don't want that dragging\n\n01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.400\nthe duck thing down.\n\n01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.400\nThat was R&D.\n\n01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:37.400\nThat was like, that was like workshopping.\n\n01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.400\nThat's not even going to air on the West Coast.\n\n01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.400\nYou mayor, you mayor\n\n01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:43.400\nall, all

best music of all time.\n\n01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.400\nThey speak three languages in Fijian.\n\n01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.400\nBy default.\n\n01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:07.400\nThe English Fijian, and Fijian has like 19 dialects\n\n01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.400\nbut also they have to speak like,\n\n01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:11.400\nI can't even remember, should have written it down, but...\n\n01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.400\nFrench maybe? No, no, it's not French Polynesia.\n\n01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.400\nWhat is it? Is it French?\n\n01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.400\nThat's probably, yeah, I'm sure it's French.\n\n01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:19.400\nBut here's the crazy thing.\n\n01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.400\nThe kids, when they go to school,\n\n01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.400\nEnglish is compulsory.\n\n01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:25.400\nFijian isn't.\n\n01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.400\nYeah, I don't think it's French.\n\n01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:29.400\nThat's not French Polynesia Fiji, is it?\n\n01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.400\nNo.\n\n01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.400\nPeople are saying German in the front row.\n\n01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.400\nWell, Steve, do you know?\n\n01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.400\nMaybe one of the Indian...\n\n01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:39.400\nOh, Hindi.\n\n01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:41.400\nIt's probably Hindi.\n\n01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.400\nThey probably have to speak Hindi.\n\n01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.400\nThere's a huge Indian population\n\n01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.400\nbut they're descended from\n\n01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.400\nlike five generations ago.\n\n01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.400\nThey brought...\n\n01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:53.400\nI don't know who...\n\n01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:55.400\nI have giant gaps in my...\n\n01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:57.400\nI'm not a provider of this information.\n\n01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:59.400\nBut Indian people were brought there\n\n01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.400\nor came there to work the sugar cane fields.\n\n01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.400\nAnd then...\n\n01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.400\nCould it have been slavery?\n\n01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:07.400\nI don't know because part of the story is that\n\n01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.400\nthen they could go back.\n\n01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:11.400\nAnd then a lot of them...\n\n01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.400\nMaybe it was a really bad time in India.\n\n01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.400\nAnd then a lot of them could go back.\n\n01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:17.400\nBut then there's just descendants there\n\n01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.400\nof people who are like, are you fucking kidding me?\n\n01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.400\nI'm not leaving Fiji.\n\n01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:23.400\nAnd they have this really\n\n01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.400\npositive attitude about multiculturalism there.\n\n01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:27.400\nThey have this military regime\n\n01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:29.400\nthat I don't know anything about\n\n01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:31.400\nbecause they don't want to throw shade on it\n\n01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.400\nbecause they're so nice.\n\n01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.400\nBut they have this tribe of...\n\n01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.400\nThey have these provinces\n\n01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.400\nand then each province is headed up by an elder.\n\n01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:41.400\nBecause it's just old school stuff.\n\n01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.400\nAnd they don't have any power\n\n01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:45.400\nin the sense that\n\n01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.400\nthere's no contract.\n\n01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:49.400\nBut if you were to defy them,\n\n01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.400\nthey're like the greybeards\n\n01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:53.400\nin Skyrim.\n\n01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.400\nAlright.\n\n01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:57.400\nYou didn't talk...\n\n01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:59.400\nBut they...\n\n01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:01.400\nYou didn't mention how\n\n01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:03.400\nwhen we got in the car,\n\n01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:05.400\none of the first things the guy said\n\n01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.400\nwhen we got there was he was talking about\n\n01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.400\ndisrespecting local Fijians.\n\n01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.400\nHe was talking about a missionary that got\n\n01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.400\neaten there because he rubbed their head or something.\n\n01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.400\nThat's just...\n\n01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:17.400\nWhat is that?\n\n01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.400\nI rubbed his head.\n\n01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.400\nHe didn't eat me.\n\n01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.400\nI don't know how much of South Pacific\n\n01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.400\nislands the thing is\n\n01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.400\nwhen I was in Tahiti, the third sun thing?\n\n01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:29.400\nYou know about that?\n\n01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:31.400\nYeah, but wait, hold on, because that's rich.\n\n01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:33.400\nRich is the third sun.\n\n01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.400\nYou know rich?\n\n01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:37.400\nThat's worth talking about.\n\n01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.400\nI want you to talk about that\n\n01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.400\nbecause you were telling us about that in Australia.\n\n01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.400\nI thought that was really fascinating.\n\n01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.400\nBut the elders,\n\n01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:47.400\nwhen the refugee crisis happened,\n\n01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.400\nor it was actually a previous refugee crisis,\n\n01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.400\nnot the current Syrian one,\n\n01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:53.400\nbut it was something similar.\n\n01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.400\nThere's a bunch of people that needed homes,\n\n01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.400\nand the elders\n\n01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:59.400\ngave a bunch of Fijian land\n\n01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:01.400\nto any refugees that wanted to come to Fiji.\n\n01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.400\nWho doesn't want to go to Fiji?\n\n01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.400\nBut it's only on the condition\n\n01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:07.400\nof the land.\n\n01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.400\nIt's theirs to live on and do as they please\n\n01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.400\nand reproduce on and work until\n\n01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.400\nthe day they die and their children do whatever.\n\n01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:15.400\nBut it's just like, they can't sell it.\n\n01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:19.400\nThey're fucking ecstatic.\n\n01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.400\nThey have a thriving\n\n01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:23.400\nsection of people there\n\n01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.400\nthat were descended from refugees.\n\n01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.400\nI think it was Afghanistan\n\n01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.400\nand it was the Middle East.\n\n01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.400\nBad things don't automatically happen to you\n\n01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.400\njust because you're like,\n\n01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.400\nhey, if you want to use my pool,\n\n01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.400\nyou know?\n\n01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.400\nNobody's going to go,\n\n01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.400\nyou sooner could use it and take a shit.\n\n01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.400\nIt's the worst part of you\n\n01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.400\nthat assumes that about them.\n\n01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.400\nTalk about your Tahitian...\n\n01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:49.400\nI will get this wrong.\n\n01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:51.400\nDoes anybody know more about this than I do?\n\n01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.400\nThere's a thing called...\n\n01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.400\nI forget the word for it in Samoan or Tahitian,\n\n01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:57.400\nbut I will get all this wrong,\n\n01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:59.400\nso please send your letters to Steve Levy\n\n01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:03.400\nat stevelevy.hotmailballworship.com.\n\n01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.400\nThere are a bunch of guys\n\n01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.400\non the island there\n\n01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.400\nthat are as big as every other guy\n\n01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.400\nand they're raised as women, I believe,\n\n01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.400\nand I think it's a third son thing.\n\n01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:21.400\nIf you're the third son, you are raised as a woman.\n\n01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.400\nIt's like a place of honor.\n\n01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:25.400\nI think it's different throughout the islands.\n\n01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:27.400\nThere's a huge...\n\n01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.400\nTransvestite culture.\n\n01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.400\nThey're regarded as\n\n01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.400\nnot divine, but special.\n\n01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:35.400\nI believe there's a part of it\n\n01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:37.400\nwhere if you're the third son,\n\n01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:39.400\nyou're raised to be another woman in the house.\n\n01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:41.400\nAnd they're treated with huge respect.\n\n01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.400\nThey'll just be this giant\n\n01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.400\nPacific Islander guy\n\n01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:47.400\nwalking by you,\n\n01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.400\nor he or she.\n\n01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:51.400\nI don't know how it works,\n\n01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.400\nbut they have makeup on\n\n01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.400\nand they dance the woman parts\n\n01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:57.400\nand they do the female\n\n01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:59.400\nwork in the household.\n\n01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.400\nI know I'm fucking all this up.\n\n01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.400\nI have not done any research on it,\n\n01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:05.400\nbut that's the bits and pieces that I thought I picked up.\n\n01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:07.400\nWe went across the island\n\n01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.400\nfrom the resort to where the locals hung out\n\n01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.400\non Sunday, which is their day off,\n\n01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.400\nand it was all of them...\n\n01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.400\nSo this woman or\n\n01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.400\nman or whatever,\n\n01:33:17.400 -->

Yes.\n\n01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:57.400\nBut Dan's went missing.\n\n01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.400\nWell, wait, what's this?\n\n01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:01.400\nThat's a new one. Oh, wait, but...\n\n01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:03.400\nWhat's the case?

Use it.\n\n01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:21.400\nFuck your crowdfunded glass.\n\n01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.400\nWasn't there controversy about the crowdfunding?\n\n01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:25.400\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:27.400\nSo, yeah, we...\n\n01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:29.400\nAfter the first one was gone,\n\n01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:31.400\nwe assumed stolen based on\n\n01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:33.400\nthe word from backstage.\n\n01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.400\nThere was a lot of upcry\n\n01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:37.400\nonline, and we knew that you were disappointed.\n\n01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:39.400\nWe knew that people really enjoyed\n\n01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:41.400\nseeing this special rocks glass\n\n01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.400\nthat we'd made.\n\n01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:45.400\nSo we... And for the listeners\n\n01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:47.400\nnot watching the video,\n\n01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:49.400\nthey're kind of a beautiful play\n\n01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:51.400\noff of a red solo cup.\n\n01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:53.400\nYeah, so they're based on the design of a solo cup.\n\n01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:55.400\nSo I came up with the design for it,\n\n01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.400\nand then I worked with a glass maker.\n\n01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:59.400\nSo I work in Corning,\n\n01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:01.400\nand worked with a master glassblower to make glass...\n\n01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:03.400\nAnd this is conflict glass, isn't it?\n\n01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.400\nThis is...\n\n01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:07.400\nIt's made out of sand\n\n01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.400\nthat...\n\n01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:11.400\nFrom Aleppo.\n\n01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:13.400\nThere's a special...\n\n01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:15.400\nWhen a mortar round\n\n01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:17.400\nhits sand,\n\n01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:19.400\nit creates a special glass.\n\n01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.400\nIt just has a little less aftertaste.\n\n01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:23.400\nThere's actually some Trinitite\n\n01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:25.400\nmixed in there, too. There's some...\n\n01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:27.400\nThe molten sand from White Sands\n\n01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.400\nis there from the first nuclear explosion.\n\n01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:31.400\nNo, no, I'm kidding. Sorry.\n\n01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:33.400\nI've got bits.\n\n01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.400\nYou got bits? That's good. No.\n\n01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:37.400\nI know you were interested in glass.\n\n01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.400\nYeah, so we did a...\n\n01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.400\nWe had Indiegogo.\n\n01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.400\nWe raised the money to pay the glassblower\n\n01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:45.400\nto recreate his work.\n\n01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.400\nAnd in the process, he made the double rocks glass\n\n01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:49.400\nfor you to make up for yours.\n\n01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:51.400\nYou've already got one, so we didn't make one for you.\n\n01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:53.400\nI'm set.\n\n01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.400\nCan we do a reverse Indiegogo\n\n01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:57.400\nwhere I can just pay everybody back?\n\n01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:59.400\nWhoa.\n\n01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:01.400\nSo we actually have a full set of four now.\n\n01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:03.400\nOh, cute.\n\n01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:05.400\nWith a slot for Dan and Jeff.\n\n01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:07.400\nAlso, for the listener,\n\n01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:10.400\nit's in what looks like a weapons grade gun case.\n\n01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:12.400\nYeah, custom foam inserts.\n\n01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.400\nSo this is actually a request\n\n01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:16.400\nfrom Chris and Sarah backstage\n\n01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.400\nto have something in a Pelican case\n\n01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:20.400\nthat they can then store with the equipment.\n\n01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:22.400\nIt's a Nick Fury\n\n01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.400\nbeverage wear case.\n\n01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:27.400\nHow did you make those custom foam inserts, I want to know?\n\n01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.400\nBecause I've often\n\n01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:31.400\nlooked into getting some custom foam inserts\n\n01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:33.400\nmade for various briefcases.\n\n01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:35.400\nI forgot about the sponsor.\n\n01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:37.400\nMarcus's custom foam inserts.\n\n01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:42.400\nSome from me inserts.\n\n01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.400\nSo many nights, like 2, 3 a.m.\n\n01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:46.400\nI'll get a text from Spencer\n\n01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:49.400\njust haranguing me about foam inserts.\n\n01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.400\nIt's near and dear to my heart, in all honesty.\n\n01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:57.400\nWe can take this offline.\n\n01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:59.400\nHave you guys seen this commercial?\n\n01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:01.400\nI don't have to watch commercials,\n\n01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.400\nbut we were in New York,\n\n01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:05.400\nand so I saw a lot of this catheter cowboy\n\n01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:07.400\nthat I think I Instagram.\n\n01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:09.400\nAnd then there was this guy,\n\n01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:11.400\nlike the MyPillow guy?\n\n01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:13.400\nHave you guys know that?\n\n01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:15.400\nIs that air here?\n\n01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:17.400\nHe's so proud of his pillow.\n\n01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:19.400\nBecause his product is called MyPillow.\n\n01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:21.400\nIn his mind, it's a brand name,\n\n01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:23.400\nbut it's just the words MyPillow.\n\n01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:25.400\nSo all he is is a nine foot\n\n01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:27.400\nmustachioed, like kind of\n\n01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:29.400\nfirefighter physique guy\n\n01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:31.400\nclutching a pillow to his chest,\n\n01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:33.400\njust saying, MyPillow is the best pillow\n\n01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:35.400\nyou'll ever have.\n\n01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:37.400\nHe's just talking about\n\n01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:39.400\nMyPillow and how great it is.\n\n01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:40.400\nAnd it's adorable.\n\n01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:42.400\nYou're going to love MyPillow.\n\n01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:43.400\nIf you can get it.\n\n01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:44.400\nI designed MyPillow\n\n01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:46.400\nso that my head could...\n\n01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.400\nI dare you to take MyPillow.\n\n01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:50.400\nNormal pillows make you lose sleep.\n\n01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.400\nMyPillow doesn't.\n\n01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:52.400\nI wake up in the morning\n\n01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:54.400\nrefreshed all the time.\n\n01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:56.400\nCall MyPillow.\n\n01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.400\nIf you want MyPillow.\n\n01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:01.400\nAnyways, so Jane, how's it going?\n\n01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:03.400\nJane the person to give us some updates,\n\n01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:06.400\nnot Jane the glassware provider.\n\n01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.400\nRight.\n\n01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:08.400\nThe second part.\n\n01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:09.400\nSo I've actually...\n\n01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:11.400\nWe've been talked on and off\n\n01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.400\nover the last three years, really.\n\n01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:15.400\nI've actually reached a point\n\n01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.400\nwhere I have given notice at work\n\n01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:20.400\nthat I'd like my name officially\n\n01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:22.400\non the record to begin to be\n\n01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.400\nDr. Jane Cook.\n\n01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:27.400\nSo I'm hoping that it will come to pass\n\n01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.400\nin the next couple of months at work.\n\n01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:33.400\nSo that'll be officially out there.\n\n01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:35.400\nI kind of like that that's the last step.\n\n01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:38.400\nLike I said something about you as a person.\n\n01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:41.400\nI like the last step being the professional world.\n\n01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:43.400\nIt really needs to be...\n\n01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:45.400\nI built up a reputation over 20 years\n\n01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:47.400\nas a scientist.\n\n01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:49.400\nAnd my name was out there on\n\n01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:51.400\npapers and patents and whatnot.\n\n01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:53.400\nSo there was also a respect\n\n01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:54.400\nfor the institution.\n\n01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.400\nI work at a museum,\n\n01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:59.400\nwhich is a public educational institution.\n\n01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:04.400\nAnd my transitioning my gender\n\n01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.400\nis sort of my thing,\n\n01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:07.400\nhow I present it.\n\n01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:09.400\nI don't want the story of that institution\n\n01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:10.400\nto be me.\n\n01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:11.400\nRight.\n\n01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:12.400\nThe story of the institution is glass.\n\n01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:13.400\nIt's science.\n\n01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:14.400\nIt's art.\n\n01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:15.400\nIt's history.\n\n01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:17.400\nIt had to get to a point where\n\n01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:19.400\nI was feeling comfortable enough\n\n01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:20.400\nwith my presentation,\n\n01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:22.400\ncomfortable enough with my safety net,\n\n01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.400\nthat I was willing to then take\n\n01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:26.400\nthat next step in a way that wouldn't\n\n01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:28.400\nimpact the broader\n\n01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:30.400\nworld that I was part of.\n\n01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:32.400\nBut one thing that is\n\n01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:34.400\nimportant to me, two aspects of this\n\n01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:36.400\nis I'm not doing like a legal name\n\n01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:38.400\nchange and I'm not doing a legal\n\n01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.400\ngender change because fuck it.\n\n01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:42.400\nI don't need the government's\n\n01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.400\npermission to say what I am.\n\n01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.400\nI don't need the government's permission\n\n01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:48.400\nto say what my name is.\n\n01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:50.400\nNow when you've got a lot of people\n\n01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:52.400\nwho care about me, who like me to be me.\n\n01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:54.400\nWhen you fill out government documents\n\n01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:56.400\nand there's MRF,\n\n01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:58.400\nyou just stick with what was already\n\n01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:00.400\ngiven just for simplicity's sake?\n\n01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.400\nWell, I sort of think about\n\n01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:04.400\nwhat's the intent of the demographic\n\n01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:05.400\ninformation.\n\n01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:07.400\nSo if I'm going to be flying and there's\n\n01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:09.400\nstill a whole thing where if I'm going\n\n01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:11.400\nto be reading mail, it's probably better\n\n01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:12.400\nto put the M down.\n\n01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.400\nBut if I know they're just collecting\n\n01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:16.400\ninformation about what's the gender of\n\n01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:18.400\nthe people who are buying this couch,\n\n01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:19.400\nI'll put female.\n\n01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:21.400\nBecause I'm a female person on the couch.\n\n01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:23.400\nI'm a female person still when I go through\n\n01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:24.400\nthe corner.\n\n01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.400\nIf you got the couch because it had\n\n01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:28.400\ncup holders, you'll put male.\n\n01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:29.400\nExactly.\n\n01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:31.400\nBut if you got it because...\n\n01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:33.400\nI like the fabric.\n\n01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:35.400\nWhen you're talking to a trans person,\n\n01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:37.400\nyou can be totally...\n\n01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:39.400\nyou can just do all the old 80's\n\n01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:40.400\ngender jokes.\n\n01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:41.400\nExactly.\n\n01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:42.400\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.400\nHis toilet seat...\n\n01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:46.400\nYeah, I don't know about toilets.\n\n01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:47.400\nIt's up and down.\n\n01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:48.400\nThe directions.\n\n01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:50.400\nBut I want the toilet paper going around\n\n01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:51.400\nlike this.\n\n01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:57.400\nI know how to push this button.\n\n01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:58.400\nYeah, it's good.\n\n01:47:58.400 --> 01:47:59.400\nYeah.\n\n01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:01.400\nYeah, so that's good.\n\n01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:03.400\nSo you gave notice, but do you have any\n\n01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.400\nfeedback from that?\n\n01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:07.400\nI'm really lucky to work at a really great\n\n01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:08.400\nplace that it was...\n\n01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:09.400\nCongratulations.\n\n01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:10.400\nWe're behind you.\n\n01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:11.400\nThis is great.\n\n01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:12.400\nWe're so happy to do this.\n\n01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:13.400\nAnd you had that feeling about them.\n\n01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:14.400\nThey're people of science.\n\n01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.400\nYou worked in this...\n\n01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:16.400\nYou know these people forever.\n\n01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:17.400\nAnd you know that they respected you.\n\n01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:19.400\nAnd I think that's important to stress.\n\n01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:20.400\nLike that's a real...\n\n01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:22.400\nThat's very menchi of you.\n\n01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:23.400\nThe real...\n\n01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:24.400\nThe reason you...\n\n01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:25.400\nFemchi.\n\n01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:26.400\nThe reason you...\n\n01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:27.400\nMenchi.\n\n01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:29.400\nNone by menchi.\n\n01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:35.400\nEpisode title.\n\n01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:37.400\nYou exercised restraint, not out of shame\n\n01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:39.400\nand not out of profiteering\n\n01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:42.400\nor self-preservation,\n\n01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.400\nbut out of actual deference to\n\n01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:47.400\nthe environment.\n\n01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:48.400\nLike you said.\n\n01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:49.400\nI'm just...\n\n01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:51.400\nI think that's cool and neat.\n\n01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:52.400\nLike very heroic.\n\n01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.400\nLike there's...\n\n01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:56.400\nThere's different cultures out there\n\n01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:57.400\nwhere we're all warring with each other.\n\n01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:59.400\nThere's people that are militant about the\n\n01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:01.400\nfact that I don't want to throw them\n\n01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:02.400\nunder the bus if they're like,\n\n01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:03.400\nif someone's gay and they're out there,\n\n01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:04.400\nI'm going to out them.\n\n01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:05.400\nThat whole thing that we were going\n\n01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:06.400\nthrough in the 90s when it was like,\n\n01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:07.400\nyou're out.\n\n01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:08.400\nYou're out.\n\n01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:09.400\nWe're outing you.\n\n01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:10.400\nAnd then other people are going,\n\n01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:11.400\nwell, wait.\n\n01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:12.400\nHow is that helping if the person\n\n01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:13.400\nwants to be in the closet?\n\n01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:15.400\nThere are very confusing issues and stuff.\n\n01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:16.400\nSo I find that fascinating.\n\n01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:19.400\nYou have to just sit on a couch with\n\n01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:22.400\ncup holders and think about that shit\n\n01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:23.400\na lot.\n\n01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:24.400\nLike you have to...\n\n01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:26.400\nNobody else has to...\n\n01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.400\nMost other people don't have to think\n\n01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:30.400\nthat much about that shit,\n\n01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.400\nwhich is actually part and parcel of...\n\n01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.400\nOn the reverse side,\n\n01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:35.400\nisn't that part of the problem?\n\n01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:36.400\nWhen we run into bigotry and stuff,\n\n01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:38.400\nit's like people going,\n\n01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:40.400\nwhat, I got to think about this now?\n\n01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:42.400\nAnd it's like an un-plowed sidewalk\n\n01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:43.400\nin front of their house that you didn't\n\n01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:44.400\ntell them they had.\n\n01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:46.400\nAnd they're like, oh, and resent that.\n\n01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:48.400\nLike I don't have work to do.\n\n01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:50.400\nI think there's a deeper psychological\n\n01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:52.400\nand personality thing that goes into\n\n01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:53.400\nthis that...\n\n01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.400\nI think just about anybody can come up\n\n01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:57.400\nwith some...\n\n01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.400\nSome binary that they're a part of,\n\n01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:01.400\nsome system that's imposed on them.\n\n01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:03.400\nBut the real issue is what you...\n\n01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.400\nIs buried in what you were saying,\n\n01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:07.400\nis this idea of being self-examining.\n\n01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.400\nAnd being...\n\n01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:10.400\nEither just by your personal nature,\n\n01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:12.400\nyou need to be able to think about\n\n01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:14.400\nhow you think, you need to think about\n\n01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:15.400\nhow you fit in.\n\n01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:17.400\nAnd if you have...\n\n01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:18.400\nUnfortunately, if you have the privilege,\n\n01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:20.400\nor if you're higher up Maslow's pyramid,\n\n01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:22.400\nthat you actually have the resources\n\n01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:24.400\nand the privilege and the opportunity\n\n01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:26.400\nto really dig into yourself\n\n01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.400\nwithout sacrificing the fact that you don't have...\n\n01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:30.400\nI've got a place to live,\n\n01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:31.400\nI've got food, I've got clothes,\n\n01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:32.400\nI've got family, I've got friends.\n\n01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:33.400\nOkay, good.\n\n01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:35.400\nI can think about whether or not\n\n01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:39.400\nmy gender identity matches\n\n01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:40.400\nmy equipment.\n\n01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.400\nThat's a privilege.\n\n01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.400\nAnd then to be able to actually act on it,\n\n01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:45.400\nthat's another privilege.\n\n01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:46.400\nAnd to be able to act on it\n\n01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:48.400\nwith a certain amount of safety,\n\n01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:49.400\nthat's another privilege.\n\n01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:51.400\nAnd a lot of people don't get to that point.\n\n01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:53.400\nBut I think everybody...\n\n01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:56.400\nI believe in my heart, everybody...\n\n01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:59.400\nNobody fits in to anything.\n\n01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:02.400\nThe game is to figure out...\n\n01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:04.400\nThat's why when they hear the word privilege,\n\n01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:05.400\nthey...\n\n01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:07.400\nThe alarms go up.\n\n01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:08.400\nBecause...\n\n01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:12.400\nThey think that it precedes\n\n01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:14.400\ntheir fire truck being taken away.\n\n01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:15.400\nYou're privileged.\n\n01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:17.400\nYou have too much already,\n\n01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:19.400\nand they feel like Judge Reinhold\n\n01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:23.400\nin fast times, when the guidance counselor says,\n\n01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:24.400\nsorry, but the party's over.\n\n01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:27.400\nHe's like, I'm waiting for it to start.\n\n01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:30.400\nThat's what privileged people feel\n\n01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:31.400\nwhen they hear the word privilege,\n\n01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:33.400\nis they're like, wait, privilege.\n\n01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:35.400\nI just finished arguing with a lady at the bank\n\n01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:37.400\nthat it's my money,\n\n01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:39.400\nand you're telling me stuff about...\n\n01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:42.400\nAnd so it's not to validate anger and hatred,\n\n01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:45.400\nbut just to say, that's what's happening.\n\n01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:47.400\nWe all got a lot of shit to deal with,\n\n01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:50.400\nand the word privilege is being perceived too much.\n\n01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:52.400\nIt's like, someone wants your pants.\n\n01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:53.400\nYou have too much pants.\n\n01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:54.400\nNo one wants your pants.\n\n01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.400\nYou don't have to give anybody your pants.\n\n01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:58.400\nIt's just never going to happen.\n\n01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:01.400\nNo one's going to come in and take your pants.\n\n01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:04.400\nAnd that is what we get down to.\n\n01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:06.400\nI'm proud of my race, and I'm proud of my gender,\n\n01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.400\nbecause it's like...\n\n01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:10.400\nThere's almost an uplifting silver lining there\n\n01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:12.400\nwhere it's like, well,\n\n01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:15.400\nwe used to be worried about who's going to take our property,\n\n01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:16.400\nwho's going to...\n\n01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:18.400\nWe're a First World Empire,\n\n01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:22.400\nso we could be within reach of actual evolution\n\n01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:26.400\nif the timeline goes one way instead of the other,\n\n01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:29.400\nbecause we've really gotten down to shit\n\n01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:31.400\nthat are so fundamental to human nature.\n\n01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:33.400\nWe've gotten to this point where we're actually recognizing,\n\n01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:35.400\nwhat's our fear point?\n\n01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:38.400\nWhat really motivates us or demotivates us?\n\n01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:39.400\nYou can always sense how like,\n\n01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:41.400\nMeg and Kelly talking all of a sudden,\n\n01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:43.400\nlike the Fox News thing,\n\n01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:46.400\nit's like, that's what draws those viewers.\n\n01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:48.400\nIt's that thing of like,\n\n01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:50.400\nup next, a law that says,\n\n01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:53.400\nSanta has to be Mexican?\n\n01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:57.400\nAnd they feed into this fear.\n\n01:52:57.400 -->
