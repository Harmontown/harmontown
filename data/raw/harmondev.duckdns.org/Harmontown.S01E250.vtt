{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:13.000\nLadies and gentlemen, from beautiful Uptown, Bay Bank, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:13.000 --> 00:29.000\nLet's welcome to the stage the Game Master Spencer Crittendenton\n\n00:29.000 --> 00:33.000\nand your Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:41.000\nThank you very much, thank you for coming out.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:47.000\nSo, holiday weekend, we chicken for granted, we keep filling this place,\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:52.000\nbut we've got this venue now and it's not easy to get people over here.\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:54.000\nIt's Bird Bank.\n\n00:54.000 --> 01:00.000\nSo, all these people that keep filling the joint, we can probably do anything.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:03.000\nWe got them on the hook.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:07.000\nWho drove really far from LA? How far did you come from?\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:08.000\nMinnesota?\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:12.000\nYou drove from Minnesota? See, now that's a hell of a drive.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:14.000\nYeah, that's a lot harder.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:19.000\nYou must have left like this morning.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:23.000\nYeah, who wants to go to Bird Bank from Minnesota? That's crazy.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:26.000\nMinnesota you from? The Twin Cities.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:28.000\nWhich ones?\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:30.000\nI'm kidding, of course.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:32.000\nHello, Dan, how are you doing?\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:33.000\nI'm good, I'm good.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:35.000\nYou seem like you got something on your mind.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:37.000\nWell, no, I'm just trying to think of what I do have on my mind.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:39.000\nI'm afraid I don't have anything on my mind.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:41.000\nIt seems like you have nothing on your mind right now.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:45.000\nI'm in the midst of a deadline on a treatment that I'm supposed to turn in.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:50.000\nI should have turned it up Friday and it's been one of those weekends where you saw it coming\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:53.000\nand it's like, it's a four day weekend, this is going to be great.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:56.000\nI got the sick dog, so I wasn't even allowed to leave the house.\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:00.000\nSo it was really, Cody and I were like, it's going to be four days in the house,\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:06.000\nlike just sitting in bed and we don't even have to feel like we're bad people for doing that\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:08.000\nbecause we got a dog to take care of.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:10.000\nAnd then I hit Nigel.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:11.000\nFuck it up.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:12.000\nIs Nigel all right?\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:16.000\nYeah, he's okay. Nigel, so yeah, Nigel ate like a big clump of grass\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:25.000\nand then he was in there and then, look man, so Spencer was the point there.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.000\nHey guys.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:30.000\nNigel opened.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:40.000\nSo we go into the veterinarian with the Nigel dog and the doctor comes in\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:43.000\nand he's taken x-rays and then he's taken x-rays the next day so he's analyzing this thing.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:47.000\nAnd it's like, oh, there's this thing in his stomach and he's like,\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:52.000\nI thought we were bringing him in for surgery, but then the guy says, he goes,\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:58.000\nwell, at this point, you know, I think we should just wait because it's moving, this thing.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:01.000\nAnd it's just like this big thing, it looks like a tube sock,\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nbut it looks like a tube sock because now it's in its intestine.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:06.000\nSo everything that you would put in there would look like a tube sock.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:10.000\nYou could put gold in there and it would look like a tube sock.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:14.000\nIt's kind of a neat idea.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:20.000\nBut he has this like thing and I still, I'll never know, I don't know,\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:25.000\nhe just kept going, like we would say, well, he's panting now and then he'd go,\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:27.000\nwell, you guys, he's a sick dog.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:31.000\nAnd he just had that like lilting tone and every sentence began with you guys.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:36.000\nAnd then we'd go, so you think we shouldn't operate on him?\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:40.000\nWell, you guys, we don't know.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:48.000\nAnd like the fifth time he did that, I said, you do this thing where you keep saying you guys\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:55.000\nand there's this tone and the message that we're getting is that you don't want any information from us.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:58.000\nWe're not doing anything wrong, doctor.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:01.000\nWe're asking questions and saying words.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:03.000\nLike he's getting mad at us.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:09.000\nWe're assuming that the science of caring for a dog since the dog can't talk,\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:17.000\nlike that maybe it might involve collecting some data from us or maybe, hey, I mean, what, I mean, I was just like,\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:21.000\nusually in that situation, maybe, and then maybe this is a bad habit that I have,\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:25.000\nmaybe I'm a bully, like when people are making me uncomfortable, making me feel bad,\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:31.000\nmaybe I'm accustomed to the fact that then I'll try to spotlight on it and maybe because I'm a six foot tall fat,\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:36.000\nkind of dude, like maybe I get maybe I'm like spoiled, like maybe like most of the people I'm talking to,\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:41.000\nmaybe I wouldn't do that if I was talking to like the rock, you know, I wouldn't like adjust him, you know,\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:44.000\nlike maybe I need to examine that.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:48.000\nBut I haven't thought about that because it always works because usually what the person does is they go,\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:55.000\noh, God, oh, geez, no, because the very fact of like you're just pointing out that there seems to be some kind of\n\n04:55.000 --> 05:01.000\nbreakdown is enough to get everybody kind of scrambled and then you reset, now you're recalibrated,\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:04.000\nyou're communicating as humans, that's what I usually find.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:08.000\nBut I was like, hey, you know, you're doing this thing and it sounds like you don't want us to talk to you\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:13.000\nand we don't know if we're supposed to say anything and that's all, if that's the case, then I don't know.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nAnd then he just kind of blinked, right?\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:22.000\nAnd then he was like, well, you know, he's a sick dog and he's getting us out and you know,\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:26.000\nmy recommendation is that at this point we should wait and you know, if you guys don't like having me as a doctor,\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:28.000\nyou know, you can get another doctor.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:31.000\nAnd I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, but I didn't do anything.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:35.000\nI was like reeling and I was like, silence, I was like, how do I react to this?\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:38.000\nAnd during the silence Spencer goes, if you think that's best.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:43.000\nWell, it wasn't like, just hold on, just hold on.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:50.000\nI think I said that we trusted his opinion and we'll do whatever he thinks we should do or something like that.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:54.000\nI don't think it was like sarcastic, like, yeah, give us another doctor.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:58.000\nI think it was like, yeah, no, we trust, you're the guy.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nYou're the guy to listen to.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:03.000\nYou don't want to piss off a doctor when your dog is sick.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:06.000\nIt's like you're pissing off, like a waiter can spit in your food.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:12.000\nYour doctor can metaphorically spit in your dog and kill your dog.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:15.000\nSo that guy leaves, he just leaves.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.000\nAnd then I heard him slap an animal.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:21.000\nI thought when he said, if you guys want, you can see another doctor.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:26.000\nI thought he was saying it like a teenager would say it like a passive aggressive kind of like,\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:29.000\nmaybe I'll go eat some worms if you want to go eat some worms.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nAnd we're supposed to go, oh, no, you're a great doctor.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nWhich is why I was like stunned.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:36.000\nI didn't know what he was saying was, well, we have several doctors here.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nLet me go get another one, which I guess is what he's doing.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nYou can hear him faintly out there talking to another guy.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:43.000\nAnd I'm like saying to Spencer, what is it me?\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:44.000\nIs it you?\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:45.000\nIs it the dog?\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:46.000\nIs it him?\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:50.000\nAnd I was like, I don't think he knows that he sounds passive aggressive.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nI think he's just stupid in that sense.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:56.000\nYeah, he had maybe an aptitude for treating dogs.\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:01.000\nProbably doesn't spike in the same brain statistically as an aptitude for communicating with people.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:02.000\nWe don't know.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\nWe don't know.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:09.000\nThere are certain fields of medicine that doctors will tell you that we're not people persons.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:10.000\nWe're not people people.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nWe want to solve you.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nWe don't want to hang out with you or talk to you.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:15.000\nWe don't touch you.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:18.000\nWe just want to open you up and look at your insights.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:19.000\nSure.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:20.000\nMaybe this guy was like, oh, I get it.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:21.000\nThey're animals.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:24.000\nSo I can be like a savage, horrible, primal monster.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:28.000\nMaybe you're so ursine, and because he's a veterinarian, he thought you might actually be a bear.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:29.000\nRight.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:30.000\nAnd so it was like...\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:34.000\nAnd he came to you guys to prove that you're actually a person and not a bear.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:37.000\nIt was the veterinarial equivalent of a racism thing.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:41.000\nHe didn't really believe I was a bear, like a magic talking bear.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:47.000\nI put off enough of a bear vibe that a guy who loves dogs and cats and treats their ails\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nis like, I don't like this guy.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:53.000\nHe looks like someone that eats on a landfill.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:57.000\nAnd that's an enemy of the canine and the feline in my book.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:01.000\nMy name's not Dr. Asshole.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:04.000\nSo five minutes goes by and a new doctor comes in.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nAnd he goes, hello, my name's Dr. Ruiz.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:07.000\nAnd that was a surprise.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:10.000\nWe did not expect a different doctor to come through the door.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:11.000\nYeah.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:15.000\nI thought maybe like a bouncer from Jerry Springer would come in or something and go,\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nwell, you guys got to go.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:18.000\nWe need this room.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nBut a new doctor comes in.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:21.000\nHi, I'm Dr. Ruiz.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:22.000\nHe shakes our hands.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nAnd then he starts looking at the x-rays.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:29.000\nAnd he acts like nothing has happened.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nHe goes, I'm Dr. Ruiz.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:34.000\nSo we're going to do some exploratory surgery on Nigel.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:37.000\nWe're going to go in and we're going to pull this foreign body out.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nAnd I'm like, what?\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:44.000\nAnd Spencer says, okay, but what would you say if we told you that the last guy said\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nthe exact opposite thing?\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nAnd the guy says, oh, no, I know that.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:49.000\nI just talked to him.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:50.000\nI totally disagree with him.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:54.000\nI have a totally second opinion about what you do about your dog.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:57.000\nIs it Anderson and Ruiz?\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:02.000\nThey're like, this is the thing that will plague me forever because this guy was nice.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nAnd I was like, yes, now we're talking.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:05.000\nCut my dog open.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:06.000\nSee you later.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nHere's $1,700.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nI'll see you three days from now.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:15.000\nI changed my dog's life with a scalpel and just walked out, skipping and going like,\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nby the way, that first guy's a prick.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nBut like, what was my part of something?\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:25.000\nWere they just like, you know, like the guy comes out and he goes like, oh, we got a,\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nyou know, they probably have some veterinarian code for it.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:32.000\nLike we got a, we got a, we got a, we got a, we got a DFI or whatever.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:33.000\nYeah.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:38.000\nLike, like, we got you, let's cut his dog open and make him pay.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:44.000\nWe just, is the, is the second guy, is the second guy totally inept and loved?\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nDo they call him the butcher of Burbank?\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:49.000\nAnd like, but, but he's a piece of people pleaser.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:55.000\nAnd so, and so, I was our first guy, like the Einstein of dog, dog's eating shit.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:59.000\nAnd I was like, fuck man, you know, like, like, like, like when he's on Charlie Rose,\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:02.000\nCharlie Rose, I go, what do you think is the biggest problem facing veterinarian medicine?\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:06.000\nI think it's, I think it's the worship of the myth of bedside manner.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:12.000\nI got to tell you, I, like, like, I, I think we're, I think we, we, we, we, these, these are patients that can't speak to us.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nAnd if they, I'm sorry, I'm getting upset, Charlie.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:16.000\nHe's like, yeah, well you're doing this thing.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:17.000\nYou sound kind of patronizing.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:18.000\nSee, it's happening again.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:22.000\nBut I'm telling you, I'm a good fucking dog doctor and I could have been a brilliant child doctor,\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:25.000\nbut nobody's going to let me near those little fuckers.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:33.000\nLike, like, like, so I, so I, so I humble myself, I stoop, I try to do my best, no harm, I come into this stinky hospital.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:39.000\nI'm dealing with these little tiny scaled down disposable patients.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:43.000\nBut I'm still a big prick.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:46.000\nI'm still the worst guy in the hospital.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nAnd he's like, he's trying to save you money.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nHe's like, I don't think this is a big deal.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:54.000\nYou're going to talk to Ruiz in 45 seconds and he loves to charge you for it.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nI'll go get Jack the Ripper.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nElective dog surgery.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:01.000\nWell, you like feeling good about yourself.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nYou want to make a best friend?\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nWhether it loves cutting your dog up, I'll go get him.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:06.000\nSo what happened?\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nDid Nigel get sliced open?\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:09.000\nYeah.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:12.000\nAnd the ongoing debate was, is this going to be the world's,\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:15.000\nis this going to be the end of our Meundi's relationship?\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:18.000\nBecause is he going to pull out like a whole thing?\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:23.000\nBecause Nigel just eats a lot of fabric and stuff and it looked like, you know, they give the dog barium\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:26.000\nand all we knew is that there's a big thing that soaked up all the barium,\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nmoving very slowly through him.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:32.000\nSo then Spencer called the hospital and then the subtext of the story,\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:35.000\nSpencer loves my dog more than me.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:39.000\nBut he said, they pulled grass out of him.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:40.000\nIt was just grass.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:43.000\nIt was a bunch of grass, yeah.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:47.000\nYou know, cows that take some like three whole stomachs to digest that shit.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:50.000\nCellulose, you can't digest cellulose unless you're a dog.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nOh, wait, wait, no.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nDogs and humans don't talk.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:59.000\nDeer and cows, they have different systems to digest cellulose.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:02.000\nIf you can get into the cellulose digesting game, that's like,\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:03.000\nOh boy.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:04.000\nThat's like panning for gold.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.000\nLike, you got to make a lot of biological sacrifices.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:11.000\nThere's so much food in elephant poop that elephants that get hungry can eat their own poop.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:12.000\nThere's still that much food in their poop.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:14.000\nBecause it's hard to break cellulose down.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:15.000\nSo they break down a little bit.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nIt's like a very difficult thing.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:20.000\nYou know, I guess maybe grass at one point was like, Jesus Christ,\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:24.000\nwhy don't we, the biosphere's toilet paper?\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.000\nLike, everyone's just going to eat us?\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.000\nFine.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nTry eating us now.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.000\nAnd then everyone was like,\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nAnd they're like, yeah.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:40.000\nMy dog, I had a crazy dog when I was a kid and ate a bean bag open\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:44.000\nand ate all the little tiny Styrofoam pellets.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:49.000\nAte like as much as it could fit inside of a dog.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:52.000\nAnd then I just kept pooping Styrofoam poop,\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:55.000\nwhich was amazing because it was like the easiest poop to pick up\n\n12:55.000 --> 13:00.000\nbecause it was so lightweight and versatile.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:03.000\nAnd then once I went and did one of my shoes,\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:07.000\nate the shoe, like a basketball shoe I had with one of the foot liners,\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nlike the little pads that goes in there, ate the thing\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nand it came out a spiral foot liner.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:16.000\nIt came out like, you could have put that back in the shoe.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:19.000\nDogs are like fucking boa constructors.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nNigel ate a coat hanger two days before this all happened,\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nwhich is why I thought, I was like, oh, it's a coat hanger.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nHe must have wood splinters in there.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:29.000\nHe ate a coat hanger, a nice wooden coat hanger.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:32.000\nHe probably ate the grass to chase it.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nThat's probably what it was.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nThey ate something softer than a coat hanger.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nThey do eat grass, that's what everyone keeps saying.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.000\nWell, you know they eat grass with their stomach hurts.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:41.000\nI'm like, what is this information?\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nWhy are you gain saying me?\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:46.000\nThey already pulled it out, what do you want me to do about that?\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:47.000\nYou want me to go talk to the dog?\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nI think they want you to not know more than they do\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:52.000\nbecause they studied medicine and they know how to fix dogs.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nOh, well, no, I was talking about people on Twitter.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:55.000\nOh, okay.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nDon't do that.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nWhat do you think grass is thinking?\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:04.000\nEvolutionarily, so grass is like a half step up from,\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:07.000\nbecause I know moss, you know, I know moss,\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:10.000\nand moss is like pre-catalyzing.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:14.000\nCan we have one podcast, Dan, when you're not going on your moss ramps?\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:17.000\nMoss is like you're basically your first plant, you know,\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:20.000\nit's like the idea of like, well, why don't we maybe,\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.000\nwell, what are we doing on the water all the time?\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:25.000\nWhy don't we just like be on a rock next to the water,\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:28.000\nand then like, we'll get splashed and we'll drink that,\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nbut then we'll get a lot more sunlight or something like that.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nAnd that's before the advent,\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nbecause then you're just limited to like the surface of things.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:39.000\nAnd then the big step was capillary action.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:44.000\nTaking advantage of water's slight negative ionic charge,\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nwhich you will see illustrated when you do dishes\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nand try to pull your plates apart.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:57.000\nThat's a whole, that's how, but water, if it didn't have that slight charge to it,\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:01.000\nthen it couldn't be drawn up as far basically as you want to.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:07.000\nA redwood tree is using that slight charge to carry water all the way up,\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:10.000\nprobably very wrong about most of this.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nBut it's the precursor.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:15.000\nThis, by the way, Dan briefly went to community college\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:19.000\nand took a biology class, learned a lot about plants,\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:23.000\nand now knows exactly this much about plants,\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:26.000\nbut wrote a TV show about going to community college.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nBut it's pretty fascinating because water has,\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nthe first thing you learn in biology is like,\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:31.000\nwell, let's talk about water first.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:34.000\nIt's because the water is like, oh, it's everywhere to us,\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nand it's like, oh, water, fuck water.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:39.000\nEach shit, water, your piece of shit, like you're just like, whatever,\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nlike, oh, water's here, who cares?\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:44.000\nOh, it's old 80% of the earth,\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:48.000\nbut water is, it's a magical, a magical, it's not magical,\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nthat's, if I'm trying to get you interested in science,\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:53.000\nI shouldn't call things magical.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nI should write a book about wizards or something,\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nand if I wanted to...\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nYou should write a book about wizards.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nAnd you know what, it's not hard!\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:08.000\nIt has many properties that make life on earth possible\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nif water was just a little bit different in any way.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:14.000\nFor instance, water expands when it freezes, so it floats,\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:17.000\nso a planet that goes through an ice age,\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:21.000\nif water on top freezes and you get your little tiny boogins underneath,\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:24.000\nyour little creepy fish, they can keep living,\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:27.000\nall those little monsters.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:28.000\nCrayobugins are coming.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nCrayobugins.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:33.000\nAnd that earth thaws and we come crawling back out and we go,\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nlet's do this again.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:36.000\nCouldn't do that if...\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:40.000\nYou're fucking dropping some serious science on this show.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:41.000\nYeah.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:42.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nI like your pink Floyd shirt, that's very exciting.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:47.000\nCody went to the Roger Waters concert.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:51.000\nI guess he has like this big dick.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:54.000\nShe showed me pictures, did anyone go to the...\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:57.000\nHas anyone been into Roger Waters?\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nShe showed me a picture.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:03.000\nWhen I was your age, I mean, when I was 15,\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:07.000\nI was like really into the Roger Waters pink Floyd.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:08.000\nIt was very important to me,\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nbut I never actually bothered to see a photo of him,\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nbecause it was pre-internet.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nI didn't go type Roger Waters,\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:17.000\noh, let's see how he looks, because I'm not a vain person.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:20.000\nI don't live in that world.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:24.000\nI thought he was probably black,\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:28.000\nbecause he was important to me.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nAnd I didn't care.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:33.000\nI cared enough to think he was black,\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:37.000\nand positively judged him for the color of his skin.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:40.000\nBut anyways, he's a very fit man,\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nbecause he's got to be 109,\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:49.000\nand he's definitely not eating what I ate this weekend,\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:52.000\nand it's like a picture of him from the thing.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:56.000\nBut he's got this big boner in his pants.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nCody sent me a photo, and he's like,\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\nlook how big his dick is,\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:06.000\nand look how hard it gets from his work.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nReally, you can just, like, this is very,\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:12.000\nlike, that's something, he wins,\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nbecause also he made that album,\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:17.000\nand it was like, oh, hey, well, walls are important to kids,\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.000\nbecause they're about education or psychology.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nLike, well, I'm young, I'm gonna, oh, I got it.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nOh, it's a brick in the wall.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nAnd then he got into his, you know,\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:29.000\nSteve Martin's tweeting a couple bad jokes\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\non Twitter kind of phase, where you're like,\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nokay, I'm not the sharpest guy,\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:36.000\nI should probably try to hire writers from here.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nLike, you know, I'm getting to that age\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:42.000\nwhere you want to start mentoring in comedy and other things.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:45.000\nLike, you know, you're kind of going into your\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:47.000\nGandalf the Brown phase,\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nkind of just going,\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:52.000\njust start getting into growing basil or something.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:55.000\nBut at that exact age,\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nthe Berlin Wall comes down,\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nand Roger Waters comes out of retirement and is like,\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\noh, let's do a concert for the wall,\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nbecause it's the wall, and now you got,\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nand then Trump is like, oh, the wall,\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:08.000\nand he was like, let's do it.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nHe's got a perfect life,\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nI bet he was just out of money,\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nand then Trump was like, we're gonna build a wall,\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nand he was like, he slew down a fire pole,\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:19.000\nor his own dick.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:23.000\nIn his head.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:26.000\nMoney.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:29.000\nSo Roger Waters has got a big 90-year-old car.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:32.000\nHe's got a giant baton in his pants.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:35.000\nOr he's so vain that he puts like a flashlight down there,\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nbecause it's important.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nMaybe that's like a holdover from 60s rock,\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nhe's like, well, you got to do it, everybody does it.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nYeah, he got his stuff, ladies.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nPeople did stuff, he might be an old school stuffer.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:48.000\nHe's probably not even thinking about it, it's like, you know.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:51.000\nWe should have him on the show and find out.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:54.000\nPardon?\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nYou know people that are on tourism?\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:59.000\nCan you text him right now and find out how big his dick is?\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:02.000\nAlright.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:05.000\nI've got a little black book\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:08.000\nwith my poems in it.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:12.000\nGot a bag, got a toothbrush, and a comb.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:15.000\nStevie Nicks?\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nAlright.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nThat was some stuff I talked about\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nat that weird show we did last week\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:24.000\nat that freaky Chris Hardwick cult meeting\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:27.000\nthat we went to in the middle of.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nWe made it out in the woods,\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:32.000\nand 90% of the crowd was dressed as stormtroopers\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nor mesics, it was pretty wild.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nI'll go wherever Hardwick tells me to go.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:39.000\nIt's called the Patriarchy, look it up.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:42.000\nHe's a hard wick.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:45.000\nI would go, if he was a soft wick,\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:48.000\nI would listen to him 10% less.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:51.000\nIf he had no wick at all, nope, can't be president.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:54.000\nOh, not funny.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nOkay.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nToo true, okay.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nWe started out as a simple word play\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:04.000\nand penis jokes turned into a negatively resonant\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nlate motif for the ladies\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nand the men that support them.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:10.000\nIt wasn't like there was a bunch of guys going,\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nwomen can't be president.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:15.000\nWe got a lot of enlightened people here.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:18.000\nSorry, I hurt you.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:21.000\nYou're probably very excited then about that,\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:25.000\nthe fact that the 25th amendment is now going to be invoked\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:29.000\nbecause he tweeted a meme with a CNN thing on it.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\nOh, yeah?\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nWe're all just so fucking, we're like,\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nwhat are you talking, just stop.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nThis was like the big turning point,\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nI saw people on Twitter being like,\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\neven saying to guys I really like,\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nthey're just going like Keith Olberman going,\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nlook this is it.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nThey tweeted a meme with a CNN\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nand there's a wrestler hitting him\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:52.000\nand we must now for the 700th time\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:55.000\nwe must do something about this man\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:58.000\nand then just like a couple people tweeting like,\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nthis is just like a sideshow now,\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:02.000\nlike I don't even want to do this anymore.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:05.000\nLike this thing where we pretend like you can stop the antichrist,\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\nlike it's not, let's just enjoy it, it's biblical,\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\nlet's just enjoy it.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:13.000\nI think it's not a cheery thought\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:16.000\nbut I was thinking today when I had the same reaction to that,\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:19.000\nlike we're going to look back fondly on today,\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:23.000\nlike on these days because he's not a professional tyrant.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:26.000\nThe next president is going to be worse than him.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:28.000\nHe's a clown, it's going to get worse.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:30.000\nWe're not going to go like, oh, this is the dark ages\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\nand we're going to have an awesome president next time.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nIt's going to get sadder and worse\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nbut the next people are going to be pros,\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:39.000\nnot winging it and not being, you know,\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:45.000\nlike just crappy, you know, WWF characters, you know.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:49.000\nWell, it's like this monkey got loose on the paramount lot\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:51.000\nand like everyone's chasing it and going,\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:53.000\nget back here, Bobo!\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:58.000\nBut Bobo is running into sound stages\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:02.000\nand like turning on cameras and putting on a hat\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:05.000\nand like getting a two-point rating, you know?\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nAnd so everyone that's, everyone chasing him\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:10.000\nor cheering him on is all going, ha, that crazy monkey.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nShit, you can do that?\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:14.000\nLike they said, like the monkey doesn't even know\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nwhat it's doing, like it's running into edit bays\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:19.000\nand like pressing buttons that make just like champagne\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\nand coke come out on a big sliding wall\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nthat was hidden from the Robert Evans era\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:27.000\nand like everyone's like, okay, noted there too.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:34.000\nSo if you have more than a 90 IQ plus choose fascism,\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:37.000\nyou could really get some shit done in this country.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:39.000\nWhereas he's just going like,\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:43.000\nI got lonely, I got lonely.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:46.000\nSo like he went throughout his life,\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:50.000\nlike he was the son of a fucking slumlord\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:53.000\nwith a trust fund, he blew through and then he tried,\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nhe was a Democrat and he tried to get rich people to like him\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nand rich people were like, you're tacky, you're gross,\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:00.000\nlike you're creepy, I heard you fucked a 13-year-old,\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:01.000\nget out of here.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:04.000\nAnd then he's like, those are allegations.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:08.000\nYou know, I don't have those allegations against me.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nI don't want the system to work that way\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nbut I just think that you shouldn't have 13-year-olds\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:13.000\naccusing you of fucking them.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:19.000\nAll right, so just Google it and like let's figure it out.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:24.000\nI don't know if the guy, he had like a preteen model agency\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nlike who has that?\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:29.000\nHe was like, you know, he's like doing high society\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:32.000\nand like, hey, I'm a big rich guy\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:35.000\nand I want to hang out with the Baldwin's and the things\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nand you know, he was just kind of a joke\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nand then he's just like getting older and older\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:42.000\nand then he's like, and then he's like,\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:45.000\nso who in this world that's left\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:49.000\nwould ever just give me what Howard Stern was giving me,\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nwhat the television show was giving me,\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:54.000\nand this is like, you know, the P.T. Barnum\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:59.000\nlike devil character from Needful Things\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:02.000\nwas like, well, I got the bin over here\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:06.000\nwhich is just hillbilly Nazis would love you.\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:08.000\nAre you sure about that?\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nThat doesn't seem like a big fit to me.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nIt sounds like a great sitcom.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nLike no, no, they're pretty easy.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nYou put on this trucker cap\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:19.000\nand just start saying I'm tired of brown people.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:22.000\nLike it'll catch on, believe me,\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nwe're right for it.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:26.000\nAnd he's like, okay, I'll try it\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nand it fucking worked and I'm going to kill myself.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nAll right.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nBut yeah, I was just thinking, you know,\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:34.000\nit's like these people are like,\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:37.000\noh, oh, look at it, this is it.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nThis is a deal breaker with the wrestling thing\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:42.000\nthat he tweeted because it's like so sad\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nwhen people are like, because it's violent imagery.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:47.000\nIs he promoting violence against journalists?\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nLike, well, don't play into that fucking.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nHe's promoting violence against good Photoshop\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nor after effects.\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\nIt was pretty crude.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nYeah, and the guy that did it, you know,\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nand then everyone's like, well, look at the last thing\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nthis guy did and it's like some Nazi shit\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nabout how everyone in CNN's a Jew or whatever.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nThere, I agree.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nI agree with him on that one.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nYou agree that everyone in CNN's a Jew?\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nWell, according to his chart,\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nI mean, if you only go by that,\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nI don't have any other data.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nIt seemed like it was scientific.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:22.000\nBut it was like, decrying that, I feel like,\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.000\nit was like, actually, didn't you kind of feel like\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nwhen he does something crazy,\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nthen it's like, you kind of feel like,\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nwhat am I measuring it by?\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nBut it's just kind of like the Twitter's that guy's like,\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:35.000\nI feel like you see a little spike in people going like,\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nall right, come on, man, knock it off.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:39.000\nPeople that voted for him going like, come on,\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:42.000\nyou're embarrassing me, you know?\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:46.000\nBut then the more that we go, that's right,\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nhe's embarrassing you.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:50.000\nAnd technically, he's in violation of political correctness\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:53.000\nbecause that's actual racism if you look it up.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:55.000\nAnd then the person that was like, you're embarrassing me,\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:57.000\ngoes, oh, yeah, I remember why I voted for you.\n\n26:57.000 --> 27:00.000\nLike, because I feel stupid and barbaric\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nand I'm tired of feeling that way,\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:04.000\nso instead of improving myself, I pulled a lever\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:07.000\nthat said I would have to put that off for four years.\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:09.000\nBut that's us too.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nWe're all lazy.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nNone of us are out there doing fucking mental crunches,\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nlike trying to figure out how to be good people.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nI've only gotten to the point where I'm like,\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:20.000\nI'm just like, oh, I was wrong about everything my entire life.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:24.000\nThat's possible even when you're a genius.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:27.000\nSo what hope do we have for morons?\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nHow are they gonna flip?\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:34.000\nIs there gonna be an obelisk outside of a fucking trailer park\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:36.000\nand everyone that caused this problem\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:39.000\nis gonna hear this high-pitched whine and touch it\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:44.000\nand then throw a fucking spray paint can in the air\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:50.000\nthat turns into a job at a solar panel who factory?\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nI want you to never stop this metaphor.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:55.000\nI want this to go on for the rest of the show.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nI want that to be a scene in a Kubrick movie.\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nI mean, what do we think we're gonna do?\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nWe're in a civil war, culturally.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:04.000\nAnd believe me, there's just as many dumb people on both sides,\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nlike in laziness and like adds to dumbness.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:09.000\nI was like, at this point, we're at this like impasse or something\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:12.000\nand impasses don't get, they don't just sit there.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nLike we used to think we were at an impasse,\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.000\nbut what we were really in was like the reign of the bipartisan system,\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nwhich I used to sit there and scoff at,\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nbut we didn't know how good we had it and was like,\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\noh, I want my corruption back. I want my bureaucracy back.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:25.000\nI want my like, I want my fucking transparent collusion\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:28.000\nbetween two corporations that just rig debates\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nand fucking just hang out back.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:34.000\nAnd it's like, okay, so that system wasn't working for other people,\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.000\nso I'm guilty of these crimes, right?\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:38.000\nBut then again, I didn't inherit my fucking money.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:41.000\nI worked for it and see, okay, now I sound Republican.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:45.000\nLike, so like,\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nwho-who-who-who-who-who?\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:51.000\nAlright.\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nPit pause, hold up.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:56.000\nSomebody, one of our fans, go online,\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nmake that, a remix.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:01.000\nWhistle tip, whistle tip, who-who-who-who-who.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:03.000\nThat was like the EDM kind of thing.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:08.000\nThe, uh, yeah, well, that's what,\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nit's not an impasse. That's the thing.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:14.200\nOkay, so here's why, you kids, when grandpa,\n\n29:14.200 --> 29:16.000\nwhen grandpa that made Rick and Morty\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:17.080\nand it's all, it's such a bummer,\n\n29:17.080 --> 29:21.320\nwhy is he such a cuck, like, what are you doing?\n\n29:21.320 --> 29:22.560\nWhy are you talking about politics?\n\n29:22.560 --> 29:24.440\nWhy do you make this great cartoon that's like,\n\n29:24.440 --> 29:29.120\noh, it speaks to the very heart of my alt-right\n\n29:29.120 --> 29:33.160\nor Bernie Krat or Hillary Loving or Trump Loving ass.\n\n29:33.160 --> 29:34.640\nYeah, because I'm a genius\n\n29:34.640 --> 29:36.680\nand it's called Resonant Storytelling\n\n29:36.680 --> 29:39.080\nand timeless character craftsmanship\n\n29:39.080 --> 29:41.280\nand Justin Rowland's coattails\n\n29:41.280 --> 29:44.400\nand it's, there's a delicate recipe.\n\n29:44.400 --> 29:46.600\nAlso, a lot of the background art\n\n29:46.600 --> 29:49.120\nlooks like Dick's balls and vaginas.\n\n29:49.120 --> 29:50.720\nBut when you're all bummed out, like,\n\n29:50.720 --> 29:53.120\noh, why aren't you, oh, you used to

a minute\n\n29:59.600 --> 30:01.120\nwhen I was not political.\n\n30:01.120 --> 30:03.320\nI was probably just gross or something.\n\n30:03.320 --> 30:04.440\nI was probably just going

that.\n\n30:31.720 --> 30:34.360\nAnd I understand this because you're younger than me\n\n30:34.360 --> 30:37.720\nand I'm not implying that when you get older, you know more.\n\n30:37.720 --> 30:40.120\nI'm saying like, I've lived longer.\n\n30:40.120 --> 30:41.600\nSo if you've lived longer,\n\n30:41.600 --> 30:45.560\nso imagine like you're listening to a, uh,\n\n30:45.560 -->

30:59.560\nbut now you're hearing your first minute of it.\n\n30:59.560 --> 31:03.080\nIf, if the people that have been in that room longer\n\n31:03.080 --> 31:06.560\nare saying, I think this song is ending,\n\n31:06.560 --> 31:07.880\nlisten to them.\n\n31:07.880 --> 31:10.920\nThey have gotten more of a feel for it.\n\n31:10.920 --> 31:12.360\nIt doesn't, it's not so much like,\n\n31:12.360 --> 31:13.760\noh, you're so much smarter.\n\n31:13.760 --> 31:15.240\nYour IQ keeps growing.\n\n31:15.240 --> 31:17.640\nSaying, this doesn't happen.\n\n31:17.640 --> 31:18.640\nI think everyone keeps saying that.\n\n31:18.640 --> 31:21.520\nI'm like, it's like, I know the difference between like,\n\n31:21.520 --> 31:24.760\noh, the dangling chads and the abortion arguments\n\n31:24.760 --> 31:26.080\nand the gays in the military\n\n31:26.080 --> 31:28.400\nand the Republican Democrat and just out and out.\n\n31:28.400 --> 31:31.200\nLike, we're, we're, we're having a little bit\n\n31:31.200 --> 31:34.600\nof a problem here that has really actually nothing to do\n\n31:34.600 --> 31:36.600\nwith what we used to call politics\n\n31:36.600 --> 31:40.040\nbecause that word has for 44 years, to me,\n\n31:40.040 --> 31:43.160\nhas meant the boring thing, the grownup thing,\n\n31:43.160 --> 31:45.840\nthe part of the scam, part of the thing.\n\n31:45.840 --> 31:49.320\nBut politics now, it's like actually like,\n\n31:49.320 --> 31:52.880\nI mean, there's only, once this stops being the case\n\n31:52.880 --> 31:54.920\nwhere everyone's like all freaked out,\n\n31:54.920 --> 31:59.440\nlike it's not, it's gonna be like people,\n\n31:59.440 --> 32:01.520\nyou're gonna be wearing like jumpsuits and stuff\n\n32:01.520 --> 32:02.720\nand we're gonna be like walking\n\n32:02.720 --> 32:04.680\nlike stainless steel honeycombs,\n\n32:04.680 --> 32:07.440\nlike deep beneath a Mars station\n\n32:07.440 --> 32:08.760\nand they're gonna be being, well,\n\n32:08.760 --> 32:10.240\nI'm not making it sound cool.\n\n32:12.400 --> 32:14.520\nWe're never gonna get to Mars because,\n\n32:14.520 --> 32:17.760\nbecause whoever comes after Trump is gonna be,\n\n32:17.760 --> 32:20.000\nlike is gonna win by opposing gravity,\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nlike as a, people are gonna be like,\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.440\nyeah, why are you libtards always talking\n\n32:24.440 --> 32:27.240\nabout how there's gravity if you want to get the space?\n\n32:30.240 --> 32:32.440\nDid you see how stupid that is?\n\n32:32.440 --> 32:36.560\nOh, here's the, here's a meme of a gorilla going,\n\n32:36.560 --> 32:38.400\nhmm, I wanna go into space.\n\n32:38.400 --> 32:43.400\nI think I'll say that nothing can go up forever.\n\n32:43.840 --> 32:44.680\nThat's you.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.080\nBecause the world will be an ocean\n\n32:51.080 --> 32:53.680\nand they'll be like, okay, well, we were wrong.\n\n32:53.680 --> 32:56.200\nYeah, okay, we were wrong about the polar ice caps, you know,\n\n32:56.200 --> 33:00.200\nbut what is this gravity you're always talking about?\n\n33:00.200 --> 33:02.840\nI see if you're poor and you wanna get into space,\n\n33:02.840 --> 33:03.800\njust jump.\n\n33:05.120 --> 33:08.280\nIf you believe in yourself, you should be able to fly.\n\n33:09.600 --> 33:12.520\nWell, technically, you know, no, no egg head.\n\n33:13.400 --> 33:15.600\nYou fucking sell out, you traitor.\n\n33:16.800 --> 33:17.640\nJew!\n\n33:19.560 --> 33:21.880\nI know it, I haven't checked my chart yet,\n\n33:22.720 --> 33:25.200\nbut you got that fucking Jurassic Park vibe.\n\n33:25.200 --> 33:26.040\nWhat?\n\n33:29.640 --> 33:31.160\nWhich character?\n\n33:31.160 --> 33:32.920\nIt's which character?\n\n33:35.040 --> 33:36.040\nGoldblum?\n\n33:36.040 --> 33:37.920\nYeah, the Stegosaurus.\n\n33:40.760 --> 33:42.480\nYou better wake up, motherfucker.\n\n33:44.920 --> 33:49.920\nDid you see that fucking holy shit in a bottle?\n\n33:49.920 --> 33:51.920\nDid you see that NRA video?\n\n33:51.920 --> 33:54.240\nThere was like, whoa!\n\n33:54.240 --> 33:57.920\nOh, yeah, see, it's over, like, not over,\n\n33:57.920 --> 34:01.160\nlike, I mean, over, like, like, schools out,\n\n34:01.160 --> 34:04.520\nlike, they're saying, like, it's over,\n\n34:04.520 --> 34:07.320\neverybody do what you gotta do,\n\n34:07.320 --> 34:10.320\nso that's a cue for activists to do.\n\n34:10.320 --> 34:12.280\nThat video was like what's playing on a TV\n\n34:12.280 --> 34:14.240\nin the background in Robocop 2.\n\n34:14.240 --> 34:15.080\nLike, would you, would you?\n\n34:15.080 --> 34:18.800\nYeah, so much far beyond that, it was crazy.\n\n34:18.800 --> 34:21.800\nAnd here's the craziest thing about that video, to me.\n\n34:21.800 --> 34:24.640\nWhen those guys, like, there's a,\n\n34:24.640 --> 34:28.360\nwhen somebody goes into a school and shoots like 20 people,\n\n34:28.360 --> 34:30.200\nand then their response is,\n\n34:31.760 --> 34:34.240\nwell, I'll tell you this much.\n\n34:34.240 --> 34:38.160\nIf the teachers had guns, they would only be 10,\n\n34:38.160 --> 34:39.480\nyeah, okay, all right, okay.\n\n34:39.480 --> 34:41.400\nSo everybody should have had a gun.\n\n34:41.400 --> 34:43.040\nOkay, all right, well, for a second there, we thought,\n\n34:43.040 --> 34:46.520\nno, yeah, let's see, everybody should have a gun.\n\n34:46.520 --> 34:48.280\nOkay, got it, I get it, I get it.\n\n34:49.400 --> 34:50.920\nThere's almost an honesty there, like,\n\n34:50.920 --> 34:52.200\nI don't know if they believe it or not,\n\n34:52.200 --> 34:53.560\nbut their message is transparent.\n\n34:53.560 --> 34:55.960\nThey're going, oh, 20 kids got shot,\n\n34:55.960 --> 34:58.840\nso everyone should have a gun.\n\n34:58.840 --> 35:00.800\nThere is no hidden agenda.\n\n35:00.800 --> 35:03.240\nThat video, they're saying,\n\n35:03.240 --> 35:06.240\nthey're pretending that they think\n\n35:06.240 --> 35:09.960\nthat because police can't quell disruption enough\n\n35:09.960 --> 35:12.360\non their own without causing more of it,\n\n35:12.360 --> 35:15.720\nthat if there's any psychos out there with their ears on,\n\n35:15.720 --> 35:18.000\nyou might wanna just start DIYing it.\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:19.920\nThat might actually work.\n\n35:19.920 --> 35:21.320\nThat's the unspoken implication,\n\n35:21.320 --> 35:23.680\nis like, you should jump in\n\n35:23.680 --> 35:25.640\nbecause the government's hands are tied.\n\n35:25.640 --> 35:26.920\nThey're cucked out, man.\n\n35:26.920 --> 35:30.760\nLike, they gotta do these Miranda's and all these things,\n\n35:30.760 --> 35:32.520\nand then at the minute they poke some of the stick,\n\n35:32.520 --> 35:34.680\nif they're wearing a badge, then there's more protest.\n\n35:34.680 --> 35:36.280\nIt's like, it's crazy.\n\n35:36.280 --> 35:38.360\nSo, you know, and then they end it with like,\n\n35:38.360 --> 35:40.160\nnow more than ever, you gotta just like,\n\n35:40.160 --> 35:41.440\nyou gotta fucking hit.\n\n35:41.440 --> 35:46.440\nSo they're saying to their base,\n\n35:46.720 --> 35:49.800\nlike, if you're out of your goddamn mind\n\n35:49.800 --> 35:54.640\nand you pop off, it could be a solution.\n\n35:54.640 --> 35:56.560\nAnd they know that that's not true.\n\n35:56.560 --> 35:58.360\nThey know that that person will go to prison,\n\n35:58.360 --> 36:01.120\nand they know there will be even more disruption\n\n36:01.120 --> 36:04.200\nand embollement and civil war and stuff.\n\n36:04.200 --> 36:07.400\nAnd they, I mean, it's like,\n\n36:07.400 --> 36:09.600\nit's almost admirable and it's villainy.\n\n36:09.600 --> 36:11.040\nI mean, they're so committed.\n\n36:11.040 --> 36:12.200\nLike, I'm pretty sure, like,\n\n36:12.200 --> 36:13.720\nthey're about six months from going,\n\n36:13.720 --> 36:16.680\nokay, now we've been putting this off for 60 years,\n\n36:16.680 --> 36:20.880\nwe're finally gonna like, put one foot on each dolphin here\n\n36:20.880 --> 36:24.000\nand we're gonna start being actively marketing\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:25.440\nto liberals as well.\n\n36:25.440 --> 36:27.160\nCause they're gonna, they're gonna have another video\n\n36:27.160 --> 36:30.800\ncoming up, man, it's open season on you motherfuckers.\n\n36:30.800 --> 36:33.000\nIt's like, you can't go to a protest these days\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:36.560\nwithout worrying about who's gonna shoot you, am I right?\n\n36:36.560 --> 36:39.040\nWell, they already did that, you bought a gun.\n\n36:39.040 --> 36:40.040\nThey already did it to me.\n\n36:40.040 --> 36:44.560\nIt's called white male fragility, not white male endurance.\n\n36:44.560 --> 36:46.760\nI'm not gonna be the last person to buy a gun.\n\n36:48.760 --> 36:51.880\nI'm like that little mercury thing that explodes\n\n36:51.880 --> 36:55.400\nwhen something gets a little too hot because there's a fire.\n\n36:55.400 --> 36:58.080\nBut you're gonna, you haven't even, have you shot it yet?\n\n36:58.080 --> 36:58.920\nHave you taken it?\n\n36:58.920 --> 36:59.880\nI didn't get it to shoot it.\n\n36:59.880 --> 37:01.920\nI got it to wait till someone shoots me.\n\n37:01.920 --> 37:04.320\nYeah, but you're gonna get it.\n\n37:04.320 --> 37:06.400\nSomeone's gonna come on your doorstep\n\n37:06.400 --> 37:09.360\nwith a burning pitchfork and, cause that's the thing.\n\n37:09.360 --> 37:11.120\nYou think pitchforks are dangerous.\n\n37:11.120 --> 37:13.120\nWhen you light the chips of the pitchfork on fire,\n\n37:13.120 --> 37:16.120\nyou've got a real problem on your hands.\n\n37:16.120 --> 37:20.160\nYeah, in ancient times, angry mobs needed torches\n\n37:20.160 --> 37:21.880\nand pitchforks, it was a mess.\n\n37:21.880 --> 37:22.880\nAnd then...\n\n37:22.880 --> 37:25.360\nIt took us like, why did it take us so long?\n\n37:25.360 --> 37:27.480\nI think it was Eli Whitney who found out\n\n37:27.480 --> 37:29.680\nthat if you combine fire and the pitchfork...\n\n37:29.680 --> 37:33.640\nYou get a flaming trident, the ultimate angry mob facility.\n\n37:33.640 --> 37:36.400\nAnd if you can combine that with writing two dolphins\n\n37:36.400 --> 37:40.280\nat the same time, you might be the most terrifying\n\n37:40.280 --> 37:42.200\nindividual in mythology.\n\n37:42.200 --> 37:45.840\nYou're certainly not a redneck, that's for sure.\n\n37:45.840 --> 37:48.160\nIf you were pitchforks on fire,\n\n37:48.160 --> 37:49.200\nand you could still write two dolphins...\n\n37:49.200 --> 37:51.960\nYou write it on two dolphins,\n\n37:51.960 --> 37:55.440\nand the way you express your frustration\n\n37:55.440 --> 38:01.440\nwith the ruling class or a monster is a flaming trident.\n\n38:01.440 --> 38:02.440\nYou're probably not a redneck.\n\n38:02.440 --> 38:03.440\nYou're probably not a redneck.\n\n38:03.440 --> 38:06.280\nYou might be like Prince Namor, I don't know.\n\n38:06.280 --> 38:10.280\nYou might be from like Mount Olympus.\n\n38:10.280 --> 38:12.720\nBut did you notice that jumped the shark, that invention,\n\n38:12.720 --> 38:13.720\nangry mobs?\n\n38:13.720 --> 38:15.720\nThey just stopped...\n\n38:15.720 --> 38:19.680\nYou never see the flaming trident used in angry mobbery.\n\n38:19.680 --> 38:24.480\nWell, Egypt kind of did it, like the Arab Spring kind of thing.\n\n38:24.480 --> 38:27.640\nThey went full on, like, angry mob shit.\n\n38:27.640 --> 38:28.640\nThey went strung the best deal.\n\n38:28.640 --> 38:29.640\nThey have flaming tridents?\n\n38:29.640 --> 38:30.640\nI don't know.\n\n38:30.640 --> 38:33.120\nThey probably have the modern equivalent of that.\n\n38:33.120 --> 38:34.800\nAll right, well, we'll get back to that.\n\n38:34.800 --> 38:36.200\nWait, what were we talking about?\n\n38:36.200 --> 38:38.920\nI'm just saying, you're going to wait until somebody\n\n38:38.920 --> 38:45.240\ncomes up at your place with a weapon to take your dog or something,\n\n38:45.240 --> 38:47.440\nand then you're going to pick up your gun, like Woody Allen's going to fly\n\n38:47.440 --> 38:49.440\napart because you don't know how to use it.\n\n38:49.440 --> 38:50.440\nYou have to go...\n\n38:50.440 --> 38:53.600\nI've already field stripped it and cleaned it and put it back together.\n\n38:53.600 --> 38:56.640\nWhat I don't know how to do is get the little rockets\n\n38:56.640 --> 39:00.160\ninside the clippy thing.\n\n39:00.160 --> 39:01.240\nI can't...\n\n39:01.240 --> 39:04.160\nI can get one in, and then I'm like, really?\n\n39:04.160 --> 39:05.160\nIt's this...\n\n39:05.160 --> 39:06.160\nYou have to push this hard?\n\n39:06.160 --> 39:07.160\nI'm pretty sure...\n\n39:07.160 --> 39:08.160\nIt's going to shoot!\n\n39:08.160 --> 39:09.160\nI don't know.\n\n39:09.160 --> 39:13.400\nYou can go on Google and type in how to put rockets in clippy bits and you'll...\n\n39:13.400 --> 39:16.840\nI'm scared to load the magazine because also it's like that's, you know,\n\n39:16.840 --> 39:19.160\nnow you're actually loading a gun in your house.\n\n39:19.160 --> 39:20.160\nI haven't gotten that far yet.\n\n39:20.160 --> 39:21.160\nI just put...\n\n39:21.160 --> 39:22.160\nI was like, I wonder if I know how to...\n\n39:22.160 --> 39:23.160\nNo, you do it.\n\n39:23.160 --> 39:24.160\nIt takes some thumb strength to get those...\n\n39:24.160 --> 39:25.160\nI don't know.\n\n39:25.160 --> 39:27.800\nI got to get these little bad boys ready for the revolution.\n\n39:27.800 --> 39:31.200\nYeah, look, man, I don't know what to tell you.\n\n39:31.200 --> 39:36.200\nI'm not a role model.\n\n39:36.200 --> 39:41.600\nI got two dogs and a girlfriend, and I live on a big house on a hill with a lot of fresh\n\n39:41.600 --> 39:43.440\nwater in it.\n\n39:43.440 --> 39:45.440\nI got a gun.\n\n39:45.440 --> 39:48.280\nI got a hammer in case a nail comes loose.\n\n39:48.280 --> 39:51.800\nYou just told however many people listen to our podcast that you don't know how to load\n\n39:51.800 --> 39:52.800\nit.\n\n39:52.800 --> 39:55.000\nSo it's not really...\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:58.720\nI don't know what kind of security level you think you're at right now.\n\n39:58.720 --> 40:02.120\nMaybe I'm all the way passed into the world where I'm setting traps.\n\n40:02.120 --> 40:03.120\nHave you ever played?\n\n40:03.120 --> 40:08.280\nMaybe I'm like Jigsaw, maybe I'm like playing like lame, lame, lame, wounded duck or whatever\n\n40:08.280 --> 40:09.280\nyou call it.\n\n40:09.280 --> 40:10.280\nSpencer, have you fired a weapon before?\n\n40:10.280 --> 40:11.280\nHave you fired a gun?\n\n40:11.280 --> 40:15.960\nI feel like when I was a kid I fired a gun in like a camping trip or something.\n\n40:15.960 --> 40:19.600\nHow much fresh water did you say was in your house, Dan?\n\n40:19.600 --> 40:22.360\nLook, you don't need a gun if you want to take my water.\n\n40:22.360 --> 40:26.320\nI just want an estimate of how much fresh water you think you have on your...\n\n40:26.320 --> 40:29.600\nI keep forgetting to cancel my sparklets or my Arrowhead delivery.\n\n40:29.600 --> 40:33.960\nCan I go out of town on all these shows all the time, so I've got... I have a gigantic\n\n40:33.960 --> 40:36.160\npyramid of bottles of water.\n\n40:36.160 --> 40:38.920\nSo the real fresh water is a jet sauce.\n\n40:38.920 --> 40:43.120\nI feel like I used to have that, but I got these cameras installed because I'm Batman\n\n40:43.120 --> 40:48.320\nand now that I got the camera, I swear I thought I saw...\n\n40:48.320 --> 40:49.320\nPut it to chat.\n\n40:49.320 --> 40:54.040\nI thought I saw... Google it, it's a great...\n\n40:54.040 --> 40:59.560\nI thought I could swear I saw the sparklets guy or whatever you call him now, the Nestle\n\n40:59.560 --> 41:14.360\nmobile oil guy, whatever fucking... the Pentagon ministry of drinkables, Centaurian, a five-gallon\n\n41:14.360 --> 41:19.880\ndrum of water, and I was watching him on the camera, like Phil Spector, just like playing\n\n41:19.880 --> 41:30.600\nwith my gun and just watching him because he had kind of a Cuban vibe.\n\n41:30.600 --> 41:37.240\nAnd I swear it was like he came up and then I saw... I thought he left with water.\n\n41:37.240 --> 41:38.520\nHe took my water.\n\n41:38.520 --> 41:39.800\nI think they take it now.\n\n41:39.800 --> 41:41.480\nHe might take empty ones?\n\n41:41.480 --> 41:46.520\nHe take... no, he was like... it was heavy, like he was like, oh, this water I brought\n\n41:46.520 --> 41:47.520\nup.\n\n41:47.520 --> 41:49.480\nI don't... I think he took my water.\n\n41:49.480 --> 41:52.000\nI don't know what happened, so I don't know why I should...\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:56.840\nMaybe he brought too many, and then I was like, oh, I got to take this back.\n\n41:56.840 --> 42:01.600\nI got to remember to call them... I canceled it for I forget how many months because I've\n\n42:01.600 --> 42:04.240\ngot 9,000 things of water in my place.\n\n42:04.240 --> 42:08.520\nYou're not supposed to do Nestle, by the way, you know, if you're interested in your consumer\n\n42:08.520 --> 42:13.080\ndollars advocating because, boy, we're still at that stage.\n\n42:13.080 --> 42:20.000\nIt's not at all like the branches of government are collapsing into a fucking murder van that's\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:26.920\ngoing to drive around, but if it was 1999 and you thought the way you spent your next\n\n42:26.920 --> 42:34.600\nwater dollar would influence the totally fair, capitalistic biosphere in the... the Nestle\n\n42:34.600 --> 42:40.240\nguy, like, he's on record as saying in interviews like, yeah, I don't get it, I don't understand\n\n42:40.240 --> 42:43.080\nwhy water is considered a natural resource.\n\n42:43.080 --> 42:44.080\nThat doesn't make any sense.\n\n42:44.080 --> 42:45.080\nIt's a product.\n\n42:45.080 --> 42:46.080\nEverybody buys it.\n\n42:46.080 --> 42:47.080\nYou need it.\n\n42:47.080 --> 42:48.080\nYou drink it.\n\n42:48.080 --> 42:49.080\nLooks like a candy bar.\n\n42:49.080 --> 42:54.000\nThey also... they're also like... they're trying to buy up all this water that's like\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:58.880\ncheap, that's like reservoirs and stuff, and they're getting these crazy deals for it,\n\n42:58.880 --> 43:01.840\nand they're just... they're going to profit off of it, but the water they're buying is\n\n43:01.840 --> 43:06.920\nso cheap, it's like you could start a Kickstarter and buy the water for like cheaper than them,\n\n43:06.920 --> 43:10.800\nexcept, you know, we're not corporations, so we don't have access to these markets,\n\n43:10.800 --> 43:16.280\nbut it's like we could buy that water that we don't want Nestle to buy from us, but,\n\n43:16.280 --> 43:20.600\nyou know, they won't let us do it.\n\n43:20.600 --> 43:21.600\nIt's fucked up.\n\n43:21.600 --> 43:24.000\nGot to put all your money into Arrowhead.\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:30.960\nThey're a Native American tribe that makes their own water out of...\n\n43:30.960 --> 43:37.960\nOut of rain.\n\n43:37.960 --> 43:40.000\nThey also make salt.\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:48.840\nI'm so glad I didn't think of that because I would have said it.\n\n43:48.840 --> 43:49.840\nOkay.\n\n43:49.840 --> 43:50.840\nWhat... what...\n\n43:50.840 --> 43:51.840\nWhat is that?\n\n43:51.840 --> 43:55.880\nCan we hear Sam Elliott's commercial for the fully-croisoned...\n\n43:55.880 --> 43:59.840\nHello, I'm Sam Elliott for Arrowhead Water.\n\n43:59.840 --> 44:05.640\nYou know, our water's salty, and here's the reason why.\n\n44:05.640 --> 44:08.520\nAndrew Jackson... no, no, no.\n\n44:08.520 --> 44:18.680\n80% of your body can't be wrong.\n\n44:18.680 --> 44:21.240\nThat's just general water advertising, I don't know.\n\n44:21.240 --> 44:23.440\nIt's not for trail and tears.\n\n44:23.440 --> 44:27.640\nThe trail and tears was, of course, a horrible thing that would be totally offensive, but...\n\n44:27.640 --> 44:29.120\nBut we made it delightful, just like...\n\n44:29.120 --> 44:36.640\nWell, also, it's like history's written by the winners, and we're not afraid of the...\n\n44:36.640 --> 44:39.000\nThat's my apology to anyone who is listening that's like...\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:40.000\nThat's a little hurtful.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:41.000\nI'm like...\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:42.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:43.000\nLike...\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:44.000\nAlso...\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:49.440\nYou know, because it shouldn't be a numbers game, like, you know, like, what's offensive,\n\n44:49.440 --> 44:50.440\nyou know?\n\n44:50.440 --> 44:54.640\nIt shouldn't be like, oh, that group isn't going to a million-man march us, so...\n\n44:54.640 --> 44:55.640\nYou recently made a...\n\n44:55.640 --> 44:57.160\nI thought I'd tell a putty tent reference.\n\n44:57.160 --> 45:03.120\nThey don't think you're current, but you're a baby boomer.\n\n45:03.120 --> 45:07.680\nYou still, you know, you're still loud.\n\n45:07.680 --> 45:09.640\nWhy is it now?\n\n45:09.640 --> 45:16.520\nJust hear those sleigh bells tingle in the ring, ting tingle in the...\n\n45:16.520 --> 45:18.160\nDan's got ice stuck to his bottle.\n\n45:18.160 --> 45:24.400\nI've never seen that much ice stick to anything.\n\n45:24.400 --> 45:27.520\nShould we bring up our... let's bring up two of our friends so we can...\n\n45:27.520 --> 45:28.520\nYeah.\n\n45:28.520 --> 45:29.520\nHell yeah.\n\n45:29.520 --> 45:31.880\nLet's bring up Abed Gheith and Kali Fontecchio.\n\n45:31.880 --> 45:32.880\nYeah.\n\n45:32.880 --> 45:33.880\nGot Callie.\n\n45:33.880 --> 45:34.880\nCallie and Abed.\n\n45:34.880 --> 45:35.880\nHey, buddy.\n\n45:35.880 --> 45:36.880\nOh, my God.\n\n45:36.880 --> 45:37.880\nLook at that.\n\n45:37.880 --> 45:38.880\nKali Kazoo and real Abed too.\n\n45:38.880 --> 45:39.880\nIt's a double whammy.\n\n45:39.880 --> 45:40.880\nThere's a cloud underneath this crazy...\n\n45:40.880 --> 45:41.880\nWhat the fuck?\n\n45:41.880 --> 45:42.880\nWhat the fuck?\n\n45:42.880 --> 45:43.880\nIt's a cloud of ice.\n\n45:43.880 --> 45:44.880\nCloud of ice.\n\n45:44.880 --> 45:45.880\nWhat the fuck?\n\n45:45.880 --> 45:46.880\nWhat the fuck?\n\n45:46.880 --> 45:47.880\nIt's a cloud of ice.\n\n45:47.880 --> 45:48.880\nWhat the fuck?\n\n45:48.880 --> 45:49.880\nIt's a cloud of ice.\n\n45:49.880 --> 45:50.880\nWhat the fuck?\n\n45:50.880 --> 45:51.880\nIt's a cloud of ice.\n\n45:51.880 --> 45:52.880\nWhat the fuck?\n\n45:52.880 --> 45:53.880\nIt's a cloud of ice.\n\n45:53.880 --> 45:54.880\nWhat the fuck?\n\n45:54.880 --> 45:55.880\nIt's a cloud of ice.\n\n45:55.880 --> 45:56.880\nDid you not notice that when you were sitting?\n\n45:56.880 --> 45:57.880\nI was focused on the Fontecchio and I was like...\n\n45:57.880 --> 46:02.800\nYou got the last thing right, which is a big, like a big, you know, that's a big achievement.\n\n46:02.800 --> 46:04.640\nI've never said your last name.\n\n46:04.640 --> 46:05.640\nThank you.\n\n46:05.640 --> 46:06.640\nYou said it correctly.\n\n46:06.640 --> 46:07.640\nHe said it now, just now.\n\n46:07.640 --> 46:08.640\nYeah.\n\n46:08.640 --> 46:09.640\nWere you named?\n\n46:09.640 --> 46:10.640\nWe both have unpronounceable names.\n\n46:10.640 --> 46:14.640\nWere you named after Callie, like the God of Destruction or whatever?\n\n46:14.640 --> 46:15.640\nGod of Destruction.\n\n46:15.640 --> 46:18.640\nUsually, he always shake his hand when I come up.\n\n46:18.640 --> 46:19.640\nOkay.\n\n46:19.640 --> 46:20.640\nSorry I had to do that.\n\n46:20.640 --> 46:21.640\nGlad we didn't miss that moment.\n\n46:21.640 --> 46:22.640\nIt's a ritual.\n\n46:22.640 --> 46:24.280\nNo, I was like two seconds.\n\n46:24.280 --> 46:26.160\nNo, it was important.\n\n46:26.160 --> 46:27.160\nVery important.\n\n46:27.160 --> 46:29.160\nI did it every time I came up here.\n\n46:29.160 --> 46:30.160\nIncluding now.\n\n46:30.160 --> 46:31.840\nI'm going to keep the tradition going.\n\n46:31.840 --> 46:32.840\nEat that, Mike.\n\n46:32.840 --> 46:33.840\nAll right.\n\n46:33.840 --> 46:34.840\nThanks.\n\n46:34.840 --> 46:37.480\nCallie, you're looking very smart with your fuzzy Simpsons bag.\n\n46:37.480 --> 46:38.480\nThank you.\n\n46:38.480 --> 46:42.480\nIt's a Selma and Patty, yeah.\n\n46:42.480 --> 46:43.480\nIt's nice.\n\n46:43.480 --> 46:45.640\nMy favorite part is their unshaved legs.\n\n46:45.640 --> 46:46.640\nHow's that?\n\n46:46.640 --> 46:47.640\nSelma.\n\n46:47.640 --> 46:48.640\nPatty and Selma.\n\n46:48.640 --> 46:50.880\nDid you purchase this or is there something you created?\n\n46:50.880 --> 46:51.880\nOh, no.\n\n46:51.880 --> 46:52.880\nI didn't purchase this.\n\n46:52.880 --> 46:56.240\nIt's a purse slash pillow.\n\n46:56.240 --> 46:58.640\nI guess when you pass out at parties, you need that.\n\n46:58.640 --> 46:59.640\nYeah.\n\n46:59.640 --> 47:01.320\nBecause then you can just use a pillow that isn't there.\n\n47:01.320 --> 47:02.320\nTell me.\n\n47:02.320 --> 47:03.320\nThere's never a pillow.\n\n47:03.320 --> 47:04.320\nI passed out at a party recently.\n\n47:04.320 --> 47:05.320\nNo pillow.\n\n47:05.320 --> 47:06.320\nOh, boy.\n\n47:06.320 --> 47:08.320\nI remember you talked to a guy I passed out at a party, but you didn't care.\n\n47:08.320 --> 47:09.320\nOh, yeah.\n\n47:09.320 --> 47:10.320\nThat was Rod Hasler.\n\n47:10.320 --> 47:11.320\nOh, my God.\n\n47:11.320 --> 47:12.320\nThat's just good.\n\n47:12.320 --> 47:13.320\nThat story's never going away.\n\n47:13.320 --> 47:14.320\nJesus.\n\n47:14.320 --> 47:15.320\nIt's like the okay corralor.\n\n47:15.320 --> 47:18.240\nIt's like you shot a match off a buffalo's back or something.\n\n47:18.240 --> 47:21.400\nWhy the fuck does that story keep coming up all the time?\n\n47:21.400 --> 47:25.840\nI'll tell you why by telling you the story.\n\n47:25.840 --> 47:32.000\nIt was a Halloween party or no, it was a wizard party and you and everybody came dressed like\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:36.280\nactual wizards like cone hats, like moons and stars and wands and stuff like that.\n\n47:36.280 --> 47:40.440\nMe and Justin, we just went to a thrift store and found random shit and then he was the\n\n47:40.440 --> 47:45.120\nwizard of cell phone technology and I was the wizard of the past or something.\n\n47:45.120 --> 47:46.680\nI had like an Indian outfit.\n\n47:46.680 --> 47:47.960\nI mean the Native American outfit.\n\n47:47.960 --> 47:48.960\nOh shit, sorry.\n\n47:48.960 --> 47:52.400\nThe party's winding down, people are getting kind of high, there's like maybe nine people\n\n47:52.400 --> 47:53.400\nwere tired.\n\n47:53.400 --> 47:56.960\nThere's just a bunch of out of shape wizards like sitting in the kind of like main area\n\n47:56.960 --> 47:57.960\nof the party.\n\n47:57.960 --> 48:00.800\nBecause it was a full on wizard dance party, it was just wizards, just dancing.\n\n48:00.800 --> 48:02.000\nYeah, dude, it was fun, man.\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:03.000\nI had a great time.\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:04.000\nI love seeing wizards in parties.\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:10.280\nAll of our mana has worn down, we're regenerating it and we're just talking and at some point\n\n48:10.280 --> 48:14.240\nsomebody goes like, all right, I'm going to keep talking to you like this because I don't\n\n48:14.240 --> 48:22.080\nwant to make a big deal out of it, but I want you to at some point look over to the other\n\n48:22.080 --> 48:23.080\nroom.\n\n48:23.080 --> 48:24.360\nIt was Rob, wasn't it?\n\n48:24.360 --> 48:31.000\nWhere Abed is sitting in a director chair like next to our friend Rod Hasler who is also\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:35.840\nsitting in a director's chair only like at that point like Rod, he's like, watch, Abed\n\n48:35.840 --> 48:42.520\nis talking to Rod and Rod, excuse me, Rod is just, he's falling asleep, like he's not\n\n48:42.520 --> 48:50.200\nalways sleeping, but like his head keeps like, if you were talking to somebody and they went\n\n48:50.200 --> 48:51.200\nlike that.\n\n48:51.200 --> 49:00.240\nHe was slightly awake, maybe he's a bad listener, but that's where heroism comes in.\n\n49:00.240 --> 49:04.760\nBy the time that passed around to me and like everybody just looked over there, don't make\n\n49:04.760 --> 49:07.640\na big deal, I looked over and Rod was completely comatose.\n\n49:07.640 --> 49:11.600\nHe kept getting funnier and funnier, he says his head was dangling like an apple on an\n\n49:11.600 --> 49:12.600\napple tree.\n\n49:12.600 --> 49:13.600\nWell, that's my fault.\n\n49:13.600 --> 49:18.880\nHis head was like parallel to the floor, like there was no mistaking this man for conscious.\n\n49:18.880 --> 49:23.400\nI wanted to work stories and also there was a point because you were talking and like everyone\n\n49:23.400 --> 49:26.480\nwas watching you, but we couldn't quite hear what you were saying, but there was a point\n\n49:26.480 --> 49:32.840\nwhere you were, his head was just dangling over the arm of the chair and we were all\n\n49:32.840 --> 49:40.120\nwatching you and then at a certain point you reacted to him as if he had like interrupted\n\n49:40.120 --> 49:41.120\nyou or something.\n\n49:41.120 --> 49:47.440\nLike he had made a good point that allowed you to, well, that's a different matter.\n\n49:47.440 --> 49:51.040\nHe was listening, but he's slightly zoned out.\n\n49:51.040 --> 49:54.440\nLike maybe he snored or something and they're like, well, speaking of that.\n\n49:54.440 --> 49:56.480\nWell, I thought he was still awake.\n\n49:56.480 --> 49:59.960\nSo then he did some motion that I'm like, you can't do what I'm saying.\n\n49:59.960 --> 50:00.960\nHow could you?\n\n50:00.960 --> 50:01.960\nWhat in the weekend at Bernie's?\n\n50:01.960 --> 50:02.960\nWere you talking about Farscape?\n\n50:02.960 --> 50:07.920\nNo, I was talking about, well, we worked together at the time on Mansers and I was saying stuff\n\n50:07.920 --> 50:11.440\nlike, do people at work like me, am I annoying?\n\n50:11.440 --> 50:15.240\nAnd I think like I was trying to get validation that people liked me at work.\n\n50:15.240 --> 50:18.520\nSo I was like confused because they treated me weird there.\n\n50:18.520 --> 50:20.520\nSo I'm like, come on, they like me, right?\n\n50:20.520 --> 50:27.440\nAnd I think he phased out at a certain point, but I was so passionate about what I was talking\n\n50:27.440 --> 50:29.560\nabout that I didn't notice he passed out.\n\n50:29.560 --> 50:31.360\nSo yeah, you guys saw that.\n\n50:31.360 --> 50:32.360\nYou saw me.\n\n50:32.360 --> 50:36.200\nI mean, he was awake two seconds ago and then in those two seconds he fell asleep.\n\n50:36.200 --> 50:39.280\nWell, thank you for saying the words pass out so that we could all remember to mock\n\n50:39.280 --> 50:41.640\nyou for that same thing for like 11 years ago.\n\n50:41.640 --> 50:45.200\nLook, it was weird because you guys looked over at the right comedic moment where it\n\n50:45.200 --> 50:46.200\nwas funny.\n\n50:46.200 --> 50:47.880\nNo, no, we were watching you for 45 minutes.\n\n50:47.880 --> 50:50.080\nLike there was no, it wasn't a window.\n\n50:50.080 --> 50:51.320\nOh, you got it.\n\n50:51.320 --> 50:52.320\nJust the right time.\n\n50:52.320 --> 50:53.320\nLike Planet Earth.\n\n50:53.320 --> 50:56.160\nLike, oh man, that Orca just left up for real.\n\n50:56.160 --> 50:59.080\nWe were all playing it cool, but marvelling.\n\n50:59.080 --> 51:03.280\nYou kind of had your head down and you were making a point about Ben Fold's live or something.\n\n51:03.280 --> 51:04.800\nAnd so it was a record or whatever.\n\n51:04.800 --> 51:06.720\nAnd he was completely dead.\n\n51:06.720 --> 51:13.360\nYou were trying to do a corpse and we're like, he's in heaven right now.\n\n51:13.360 --> 51:14.360\nI'm so embarrassed.\n\n51:14.360 --> 51:17.120\nI mean, because the weird thing is later when you guys said you were watching the whole\n\n51:17.120 --> 51:19.680\ntime, I was like, I didn't remember.\n\n51:19.680 --> 51:22.600\nI did talk to him, but I mean, we were all asleep.\n\n51:22.600 --> 51:24.720\nIt was the end of a very long drunken party.\n\n51:24.720 --> 51:28.160\nSo everybody gets a pass on that one, but it was, it was, it was delightful.\n\n51:28.160 --> 51:29.440\nIt sounds like we're making fun of you.\n\n51:29.440 --> 51:31.440\nIt was, it kind of.\n\n51:31.440 --> 51:32.680\nFor you guys, it was delightful.\n\n51:32.680 --> 51:34.440\nI mean, I don't, I was like.\n\n51:34.440 --> 51:39.880\nIt was almost like watching as a superhero, like, like, like you, you, that's weird.\n\n51:39.880 --> 51:43.200\nI mean, we make fun of like, like, I look, I was thinking, I can talk to people while\n\n51:43.200 --> 51:44.200\nthey sleep.\n\n51:44.200 --> 51:45.200\nI'm a superhero.\n\n51:45.200 --> 51:47.880\nI, I, like, I was, because I was writing this treatment and there's this character\n\n51:47.880 --> 51:50.480\nin the thing that Mike McMahon and I are talking about.\n\n51:50.480 --> 51:54.040\nAnd like, we're talking about the character and we're like, oh, he's a, he's a character\n\n51:54.040 --> 51:55.680\nthat's kind of deluded himself.\n\n51:55.680 --> 51:57.680\nAnd then we're talking about that.\n\n51:57.680 --> 52:03.520\nAnd then we're, it was like, we, we, it was like, we, I was like, I was like, yeah,\n\n52:03.520 --> 52:06.360\nyou know, he's like, he's living his dreams.\n\n52:06.360 --> 52:07.360\nHe's living his character.\n\n52:07.360 --> 52:11.440\nHe's living in his dreams as a, but, and it's like a fine line between that and living\n\n52:11.440 --> 52:12.440\na lie.\n\n52:12.440 --> 52:16.880\nAnd I think the, the difference is, well, what are you making other people lie?\n\n52:16.880 --> 52:19.440\nAnd if they say that you're lying, do you get mad at them?\n\n52:19.440 --> 52:23.520\nAnd I was like, oh, that's, I think that we would all admit if the stakes weren't so high\n\n52:23.520 --> 52:29.440\nthat there is this half of our president or 25% that was like, like, like we kind of marvel\n\n52:29.440 --> 52:39.240\nat his absolute fucking like, like, uh, dead, nerfed, like, just like, like the idea of\n\n52:39.240 --> 52:44.720\nit's, it's funny and almost cool from a writer's perspective, a character that if you said,\n\n52:44.720 --> 52:50.240\ncan you pass the salt, they would say, yes, I will do the best job of passing salt that\n\n52:50.240 --> 52:52.800\nof anyone that's ever passed you salt.\n\n52:52.800 --> 52:53.800\nDid it ask around?\n\n52:53.800 --> 52:55.280\nI passed the salt the best.\n\n52:55.280 --> 52:56.800\nYou see me as a character, don't you?\n\n52:56.800 --> 52:57.800\nYou are a character.\n\n52:57.800 --> 52:58.800\nAre you kidding me?\n\n52:58.800 --> 53:01.520\nI'm not, I'm not talking about you, you narcissist.\n\n53:01.520 --> 53:02.520\nI understand.\n\n53:02.520 --> 53:03.520\nI understand.\n\n53:03.520 --> 53:05.880\nI'm just trying to laser into what you're saying.\n\n53:05.880 --> 53:09.440\nWith him, that's like, when we, when we talk about that aspect of him, if you could just\n\n53:09.440 --> 53:14.360\nisolate it, if you could just like suck that little bit of juice, like, like, we're envious\n\n53:14.360 --> 53:16.560\nof that because it's called like, it's like thinking positively.\n\n53:16.560 --> 53:18.680\nWait, wait, this is like a writer's meeting you had with Mike McVan?\n\n53:18.680 --> 53:21.920\nYou were like, we can't figure out, oh, but what's the deal with it?\n\n53:21.920 --> 53:22.920\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n53:22.920 --> 53:23.920\nAs a function.\n\n53:23.920 --> 53:24.920\nNo.\n\n53:24.920 --> 53:25.920\nI was just, it was a related thing.\n\n53:25.920 --> 53:26.920\nOh, I see.\n\n53:26.920 --> 53:30.280\nMaybe I am the narcissist, you're right.\n\n53:30.280 --> 53:31.560\nI am pretty narcissist.\n\n53:31.560 --> 53:32.560\nThank you.\n\n53:32.560 --> 53:33.560\nYou just brought it out.\n\n53:33.560 --> 53:34.560\nI'm just saying.\n\n53:34.560 --> 53:35.560\nYou're doing what you gotta do.\n\n53:35.560 --> 53:38.680\nAll of us have maybe blind spots, or I'm not going to try to universalize it.\n\n53:38.680 --> 53:42.960\nI'm saying like, you, you, you could talk to a guy who was like catatonic, I was like,\n\n53:42.960 --> 53:44.160\nwe're making fun of you for it.\n\n53:44.160 --> 53:45.160\nI see.\n\n53:45.160 --> 53:52.960\nBut like, there's also like, like, I'm trying to learn that from this like, this, this like,\n\n53:52.960 --> 53:59.960\nyou know, troglodyte that we've, we've, we've, you know, chosen to, to celebrate our demise\n\n53:59.960 --> 54:02.960\nas a, as a culture, not you, as a president.\n\n54:02.960 --> 54:03.960\nI know.\n\n54:03.960 --> 54:07.080\nI'm

does that.\n\n56:35.280 --> 56:36.280\nSelga.\n\n56:36.280 --> 56:37.280\nContinue your thought.\n\n56:37.280 --> 56:40.720\nWhat, what, what, what, why should I come to whatever your show's called, which you\n\n56:40.720 --> 56:41.720\nnow tell us is.\n\n56:41.720 --> 56:43.080\nWell, it's because it's not filmed.\n\n56:43.080 --> 56:48.440\nSo, so to go back to the egotistical thing, it's called What About Me, which is about\n\n56:48.440 --> 56:50.440\nus going, well, what about me?\n\n56:50.440 --> 56:51.440\nYeah.\n\n56:51.440 --> 56:54.000\nSo every time someone ends a sentence, we're like, well, what about me?\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:55.000\nI'm important too.\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:59.920\nBut like, the birth of the show was that I was frustrated with Hollywood and I wanted\n\n56:59.920 --> 57:02.800\nto write and get people to see my comedy.\n\n57:02.800 --> 57:06.440\nSo I was like, I'll just do a show and you know, make it with my friend who does great\n\n57:06.440 --> 57:07.440\nmusic.\n\n57:07.440 --> 57:08.440\nYeah.\n\n57:08.440 --> 57:09.440\nSo it's like it's a true variety show.\n\n57:09.440 --> 57:13.960\nIt's, it's, it's what was the most frustrating thing about Hollywood for you?\n\n57:13.960 --> 57:18.600\nWell, it, it, there's a lot of things, but mainly like I've pitched and I've.\n\n57:18.600 --> 57:20.440\nOh, so you might know Abbot.\n\n57:20.440 --> 57:22.440\nSo he, he wrote a little bit on Rick and Morty.\n\n57:22.440 --> 57:24.080\nHe worked on the commercial episodes.\n\n57:24.080 --> 57:25.080\nYeah.\n\n57:25.080 --> 57:26.080\nOh, that's right.\n\n57:26.080 --> 57:27.080\nYeah.\n\n57:27.080 --> 57:28.080\nYeah.\n\n57:28.080 --> 57:29.080\nAnd I had a hundred ideas and they picked five.\n\n57:29.080 --> 57:31.160\nIt was the, it was the lack of you that frustrated you about Hollywood.\n\n57:31.160 --> 57:32.160\nOh yeah.\n\n57:32.160 --> 57:33.160\nLike, wait.\n\n57:33.160 --> 57:34.160\nNo, no, not the lack of me.\n\n57:34.160 --> 57:38.640\nThe fact that I think I'm as good as, as Johnny, two, two tones over there, who's, he's, he's\n\n57:38.640 --> 57:42.760\nlike, you know, I watch his career just spirally out of control and I'm like, Johnny, I can\n\n57:42.760 --> 57:43.760\ndo that.\n\n57:43.760 --> 57:45.840\nIs Johnny, is Johnny two tones here tonight?\n\n57:45.840 --> 57:46.840\nI don't know.\n\n57:46.840 --> 57:48.040\nHe might be here.\n\n57:48.040 --> 57:49.040\nYou fucker.\n\n57:49.040 --> 57:50.040\nMy father.\n\n57:50.040 --> 57:51.040\nFuck you.\n\n57:51.040 --> 57:54.800\nNo, I mean, but look, I, I have, you know, I feel like I can do that.\n\n57:54.800 --> 57:57.560\nSo I'm like, let me just do a show where I can do that.\n\n57:57.560 --> 57:59.560\nI know executive is saying.\n\n57:59.560 --> 58:00.560\nThat being, that's crazy.\n\n58:00.560 --> 58:01.560\nLike a variable.\n\n58:01.560 --> 58:05.280\nI can't ask you because I'm not going to start a beef between you and Johnny Pemberton\n\n58:05.280 --> 58:06.280\nor whoever it is.\n\n58:06.280 --> 58:07.280\nYou're, you're.\n\n58:07.280 --> 58:08.280\nNo two tones.\n\n58:08.280 --> 58:12.320\nI'm saying like, we're not going to, I'm not going to ask you to tell me who it is that\n\n58:12.320 --> 58:14.280\nyou do think you're, you could do.\n\n58:14.280 --> 58:20.200\nYeah,

58:44.640\nShe writes.\n\n58:44.640 --> 58:45.640\nYeah.\n\n58:45.640 --> 58:46.640\nShe wrote on hot streets.\n\n58:46.640 --> 58:52.000\nAs of a couple of days ago, I was in the show, but then I screwed up and double booked\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:53.000\nmyself.\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:59.720\nAbed, you in the show, like because you can't, you could say Johnny two tones, I can do what\n\n58:59.720 --> 59:00.720\nhe can do.\n\n59:00.720 --> 59:01.720\nRight.\n\n59:01.720 --> 59:06.080\nAnd we can't have you, we can't make you say, I mean Vince Vaughn, like I'm, so I'm\n\n59:06.080 --> 59:11.360\nasking you, what are you, what are you doing in the show that you're like, fucking come\n\n59:11.360 --> 59:12.360\nsee me do my thing?\n\n59:12.360 --> 59:13.360\nYeah.\n\n59:13.360 --> 59:15.320\nI'm, I'm like the Bob Odenkirk of the show.\n\n59:15.320 --> 59:19.520\nI just kind of write stuff and I act in stuff, but I don't give myself the main part because\n\n59:19.520 --> 59:22.520\nI like to be on the sides and I like other people.\n\n59:22.520 --> 59:23.520\nAbed's the crazy part.\n\n59:23.520 --> 59:27.640\nI want to extract their craziness in my own way and it's fun.\n\n59:27.640 --> 59:32.760\nYou know, last month, we, Fulcher, there's a, there's a sort of script that Abed writes,\n\n59:32.760 --> 59:35.920\nbut he kind of just went off the rails and did Fulcher really improvised.\n\n59:35.920 --> 59:39.880\nSo much into it and he made it way better than I wrote.\n\n59:39.880 --> 59:42.840\nSo that was a great experience because I like working with him.\n\n59:42.840 --> 59:43.840\nYeah.\n\n59:43.840 --> 59:46.240\nIt was like, we both had a talk show where we're the hosts at the same time.\n\n59:46.240 --> 59:50.200\nI saw Fulcher like in 1994, I think for the first time, it's a comedy festival and he\n\n59:50.200 --> 59:52.040\ncame on stage as a show he did.\n\n59:52.040 --> 59:56.000\nI might have the date wrong, but it was called modern problems and science or something like\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:57.000\nthat.\n\n59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.160\nIt was him and a couple of the guys and they would just get a theory that they would have\n\n01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.640\nthe, and they would get three different schools of scientific thought and they would\n\n01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.560\nprove or just prove that theory.\n\n01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:12.120\nAnd his was Russian literature and he clearly, didn't know, he clearly had never read any\n\n01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:16.800\nRussian literature, but committed to it so fucking hard that it was like, I watched it\n\n01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.240\nand I go, that's the funniest improv I've ever seen.\n\n01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.520\nI met him because I was his stand-in on Crossballs, hosted by Chris Tallman.\n\n01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.120\nBecause you guys are the similar kind of, well, I was his stand-in and he heard about\n\n01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:32.840\nme being quite a, I just was talking the whole time and Matt Bessler told me to shut up and\n\n01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:36.640\nit was like really crazy like experience and then everyone felt just like, oh, you're\n\n01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:39.040\nthe guy that was my stand-in.\n\n01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.040\nEveryone said you were weird.\n\n01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.040\nOh yeah, you should play your, you have a podcast with him too.\n\n01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.600\nYeah, I have a podcast with him on Feral Audio.\n\n01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.600\nCan you keep doing your rich culture impressions?\n\n01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.600\nOh no, well.\n\n01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.600\nOh yeah, it's really, it's just because I see him so much.\n\n01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:52.920\nOh, speaking of other superpowers, I don't know how this will translate to a podcast,\n\n01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:57.160\nbut remember at a party one time, you can do impressions of people, but not verbally,\n\n01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.040\nyou can just visual impressions.\n\n01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.040\nHe can embody you.\n\n01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.040\nYeah, I can embody you.\n\n01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:08.040\nYeah, I can do visual impressions of like, do Dan Harmon, like give us some Dan Harmon.\n\n01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.040\nI got a lot of things to say about the president.\n\n01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:13.040\nIt's really crazy because you guys are going to like what I say.\n\n01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.040\nOkay, here we go.\n\n01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:20.040\nThe president, I mean, you know, he's thinking it's a little fucked up.\n\n01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.040\nRight, yeah.\n\n01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.040\nNow do me, do you have Davis?\n\n01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:30.040\nNo, the thing about it is, so you do a character like Rich Fulcher and I just got to see it\n\n01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.040\nfor a second.\n\n01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.040\nOkay, one, one, one, one.\n\n01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.040\nWait, yeah, now do it now.\n\n01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.040\nOkay, now do Ted Knight.\n\n01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.040\nOh, Mary, oh, God.\n\n01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.040\nOh, Mary, what are you doing?\n\n01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.040\nOh, I'm up tonight and no, Mary.\n\n01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.040\nHe's just like saying that I'm not a good person.\n\n01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.040\nCan you do Callie?\n\n01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.040\nCan you do a Callie?\n\n01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.040\nHey, what are you doing there?\n\n01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.040\nLook out, we got a show to make.\n\n01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.040\nGet to work.\n\n01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.040\nSo she's Minnie Mouse.\n\n01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:05.400\nShe's easy to do because she's a character, you know, you have to be a character. It's easier to do\n\n01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:10.080\nYeah, if you really Google acting with Abed and you'll see young Jeff and a young Dan\n\n01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.580\nOh, that's old, that's real\n\n01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:15.180\nThey all turn on Abed because Abed's trying to teach you guys acting\n\n01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:18.000\nYou guys all, and Jess and Rowland and everyone\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.560\nYou come after me because of a real conversation we had\n\n01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.600\nYou're like, oh, I'm really intimidated by you\n\n01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:29.440\nYeah, and I told you that at Rob's house and then Rob goes, don't say that\n\n01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.160\nWhy are you saying that to him?\n\n01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.320\nDo your Rob

01:02:38.920\nNo, that's more like Ridley\n\n01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.640\nNo, he's like, you gotta talk about his shit\n\n01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:48.040\nAbed, you and me and Kate are going to go to this restaurant\n\n01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.760\nAnd we're gonna learn about Dr. Who\n\n01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.000\nMy favorite show\n\n01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.040\nAnd you're gonna like it\n\n01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.040\nGod damn it\n\n01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:59.480\nYeah, you had an old one where he was like, my name is Rob Schrab and I love taking shits\n\n01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.120\nNo, I know, but that was, I was being, I was on, I was on camera, I was nervous\n\n01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.800\nAnd Rob made me nervous because he was sitting there, like, just judging me with his eyes\n\n01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.160\nBeing like, you better be funny, you motherfucker\n\n01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.880\nAnd so, yeah, that was awkward\n\n01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.760\nCan you do Spencer?\n\n01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.160\nHey guys, you're, we gotta get move things along\n\n01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.960\nWe gotta get move things along,

amazing\n\n01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.440\nHey, how's it going?\n\n01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.280\nWell, you have to, she lives with me\n\n01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.280\nIt's true, I do live with Spencer\n\n01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.280\nOr you live with me\n\n01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.280\nYou guys are roommates\n\n01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.280\nOh yeah, we're roommates\n\n01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.280\nWe're roommates\n\n01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.280\nThere's a show\n\n01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.160\nIs Spencer a happy roommate?\n\n01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.160\nHe's like the best roommate I've probably ever had\n\n01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.160\nI would imagine he'd be a pretty good roommate\n\n01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:47.680\nYeah, no, I hope my old roommates aren't listening, but really\n\n01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:52.280\nMy secret is I spend most of my life thinking I'm a terrible roommate\n\n01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.280\nSeriously?\n\n01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.280\nYeah\n\n01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.280\nI can see him being a good roommate\n\n01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:00.280\nWell, okay, like, you have the most adorable cat that I get to like vicariously love\n\n01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.280\nYeah\n\n01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.680\nBecause she's got little short, stumpy legs and she's super timid\n\n01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.200\nAnd this cat has its own comedy show\n\n01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.200\nShe does\n\n01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.200\nRight, here we go\n\n01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200\nWhat about me?\n\n01:04:09.200 -->

online, it's absolutely fantastic\n\n01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.560\nKaliKazoo.com\n\n01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:12.560\nYeah, it's, I have, she did a portrait of Roy Orbison for me\n\n01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.560\nThat's hanging in my bathroom\n\n01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.560\nYeah, her Instagram is awesome\n\n01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:19.560\nShe's always doing the cute little, like, Callie looking things\n\n01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.560\nI'm not an artist, I don't know how to talk about it\n\n01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.560\nYeah\n\n01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:26.560\nShe draws like this really cute, like, kind of cutesy pie, Disney, like, pin-up girl kind of things\n\n01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.560\nBut it's always about, like, kind of sadness and loneliness\n\n01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.560\nIt's a good\n\n01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.560\nA lot of vomiting, a lot of crying\n\n01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.560\nIt's very, it's very good\n\n01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.560\nOh, I feel\n\n01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.560\nI wonder if we have time just for a couple of Twitter questions here\n\n01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.560\nOh, I hope we have time\n\n01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.560\nSomebody asked a really interesting question\n\n01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.560\nSomeone, I can't, oh, yeah, he said\n\n01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:54.560\nIf you had a thousand dollars, how much would you regret your life decisions?\n\n01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.560\nAnd I was like, oh, is that a joke?\n\n01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.560\nI was like, oh, no, you mean if I was, yeah, fuck, oh my god\n\n01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:05.560\nI was like, if I hadn't been as lucky in my life\n\n01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:12.560\nLike, how much torture would I be inflicting on myself for every fucking thing that I've ever done\n\n01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.560\nAnd it's like, it's fucked up that we do that to ourselves\n\n01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:21.560\nBecause I guarantee you, like, the fact that I have more than a thousand dollars isn't the result of smart choices\n\n01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.560\nNor should I be patting myself on the back for the choices I made\n\n01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.560\nLike, it's kind of two different things\n\n01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:30.560\nIt's like, two different graphs, like, oh, money got made\n\n01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:33.560\nBut then also, mental illness was explored\n\n01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:41.560\nAnd only because I don't have bad consequences to blame on who I am\n\n01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.560\nAm I able to say, oh, those are two different things\n\n01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:48.560\nSo if you're broke and you're nuts, go easy on yourself\n\n01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.560\nIt's 9-Eleven\n\n01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:55.560\n9-Eleven, shit, 9-Eleven\n\n01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.560\nFor people that have never seen the show, they were better before it\n\n01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.560\nWell, that's, please don't think we're terrorists\n\n01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.560\nThat's just, that's the thing that we do\n\n01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.560\nYeah, Spencer, do you want to dole out some character sheets?\n\n01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.560\nWe'll be right back\n\n01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.560\nOh yeah, let's take a mid-roll break for a pre-recorded ad\n\n01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:12.560\nDuring which the people that are in this space\n\n01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:18.560\nAnd the people that paid $5 a month to watch get a secret dance segment\n\n01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.560\nDamn, damn, do an armpit fart\n\n01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.560\nCan you do it?\n\n01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:26.560\nI've never been able to do armpit farts\n\n01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.560\nI'll show, I can show everybody, can we?\n\n01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.560\nAlright, and we're back\n\n01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.560\nNo, no, no, don't\n\n01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.560\nI could show people\n\n01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.560\nWe're not back yet\n\n01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.560\nI'll show people the, you know, that lady\n\n01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.560\nThe last segment didn't get cut out\n\n01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.560\nAnd any plebeians listened to it\n\n01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.560\nEven though it was like bonus and not for them\n\n01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.560\nWell, they got some work to do it for our audio\n\n01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.560\nThey'll figure out how to do it\n\n01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:52.560\nRight, by the time that we actually make these segments worthwhile\n\n01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.560\nThere\n\n01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.560\nI put Levy, you know, there was that lady\n\n01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.560\nShe's like, I can't remember who she is\n\n01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.560\nOh, there, there she is\n\n01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.560\nRemember her?\n\n01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.560\nShe was on Twitter a little while ago\n\n01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.560\nBecause she was like bragging about how we're spending less\n\n01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.560\nWait, what is this?\n\n01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.560\nShe's the ambassador to the U.N.\n\n01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:07.560\nThe U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.\n\n01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.560\nSo I was like, I don't know\n\n01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.560\nI'm gonna put Levy's face on her\n\n01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.560\nJust to give the old iPad a try\n\n01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:14.560\nAnd then partway through it, I was like, hubba, hubba, you know?\n\n01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.560\nLike, nothing against her\n\n01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.560\nAnd we're enlightened now\n\n01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.560\nWe're not gonna judge women, especially in politics\n\n01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.560\nFor their looks, but I'm just saying\n\n01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.560\nLike, you know, you throw Levy's face on like\n\n01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.560\nI think we're finding out\n\n01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.560\nWe found out he's a winter\n\n01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.560\nThat's really his color\n\n01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.560\nAnd I have a type\n\n01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.560\nAlright\n\n01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:39.560\nOkay, well, boy, we're back\n\n01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.560\nAnd man, oh man, you should really pay $5 a month\n\n01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.560\nAlright, you guys want to\n\n01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.560\nYou guys want to hear a little bit of\n\n01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:51.560\nPathfinder role-playing real fast?\n\n01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:55.560\nLet's get Steve\n\n01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:58.560\nOh, oh, let's bring Steve Levy up here\n\n01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.560\nHey, there's people sitting on the floor\n\n01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:13.560\nDid they pay less for their tickets?\n\n01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.560\nI want to say hi real quick\n\n01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.560\nTo Heather and Andrew Gray\n\n01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.560\nMy ex-girlfriend's parents\n\n01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.560\nWho are here from Scotland\n\n01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.560\nUK\n\n01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:26.560\nAre you still back there, Heather and Andrew?\n\n01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.560\nHello\n\n01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.560\nI think we owe you an apology\n\n01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.560\nBecause we went to their house\n\n01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.560\nWhen Dan was still with Erin\n\n01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:37.560\nWhen Dan proposed to Erin McGathy\n\n01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.560\nHe had the ring in his pocket\n\n01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.560\nWhile we were at their house\n\n01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.560\nAnd we proceeded to drink all of their Scotch\n\n01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.560\nAll of their whiskey\n\n01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.560\nSo I hope we give them some back\n\n01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.560\nBut I think we drank most of it\n\n01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.560\nI fucked up, I'm not signed into our Slack\n\n01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.560\nBecause I got a new 10.5 inch iPad\n\n01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.560\nLike an Apple douche\n\n01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.560\nBut I don't have a car\n\n01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.560\nAnd the world is ending\n\n01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.560\nAnd I can do what I want\n\n01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:09.560\nAnd I create jobs\n\n01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.560\nAlright Spencer, do you want to kick this off\n\n01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.560\nAnd give us a little recap?\n\n01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.560\nYeah, I guess\n\n01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:16.560\nYou seem very excited about it\n\n01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.560\nI always am\n\n01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.560\nAlright\n\n01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.560\nFuck, damn it\n\n01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.560\nSon of a bitch\n\n01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.560\nI feel like maybe, I don't know\n\n01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.560\nFuck\n\n01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.560\nShould I not?\n\n01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.560\nI'm just thinking that there's a trend\n\n01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.560\nWhere I read this while Dan's occupied\n\n01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.560\nAnd I think we're playing into that trope\n\n01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.560\nIf I start right now\n\n01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.560\nThank you\n\n01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.560\nThat's nice of you to notice, alright\n\n01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.560\nI'm in the DM's channel\n\n01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.560\nDan, do you want to put your little fidget spinner down\n\n01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.560\nFor a minute while we...\n\n01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:45.560\nNo, no, he's...\n\n01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:48.560\nOh yeah, I guess that is a solution\n\n01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.560\nWell, what's new in Steve's world?\n\n01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.560\nYeah, let's catch up with Levy for a moment\n\n01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.560\nYou're wearing shorts\n\n01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.560\nLevy, you look the fuck's going on\n\n01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.560\nYou look fantastic in a nice wintry pink\n\n01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.560\nDid you know that?\n\n01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.560\nI do now, I guess\n\n01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.560\nYou look a little wiped out\n\n01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.560\nYour jacket looks tucked into your shorts\n\n01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.560\nOh no, it's not\n\n01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:09.560\nYou okay, Steve?\n\n01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.560\nYeah, just...\n\n01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.560\nA little tired?\n\n01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.560\nA little tired\n\n01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.560\nWhat happened, long day?\n\n01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.560\nYeah, long weekend\n\n01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.560\nHoliday weekend\n\n01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.560\nYeah, it's just beginning\n\n01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.560\nYeah, yeah\n\n01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.560\nNot for me, it doesn't feel that way\n\n01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.560\nNo, no\n\n01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.560\nYou got to go back to work tomorrow\n\n01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:27.560\nSteve always works\n\n01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.560\nSpencer actually, he covered for me all day Friday\n\n01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.560\nAnd I love him for that, thank you\n\n01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.560\nGreat, Steve always works unless he doesn't\n\n01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.560\nI have my character sheet up\n\n01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.560\nAnd I'll just multitask between that and the Slack\n\n01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:43.560\nTo look at the PDF of the spell sheet\n\n01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.560\nAnd I'll, you know, every once in a while\n\n01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.560\nI'll pass this photo of Levy and get a boner\n\n01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.560\nBut I'll...\n\n01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.560\nThat's just going to have to be like a little handicap\n\n01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.560\nBut I...\n\n01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:00.560\nA capability, a different ability\n\n01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:03.560\nWhich picture do you think you could more successfully\n\n01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.560\nmasturbate to, the original of that woman\n\n01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:09.560\nOr the edited Steve Levy one?\n\n01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.560\nNo, for sure the Levy one, because...\n\n01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.560\nYeah, for sure\n\n01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:17.560\nMy heart, I'll be like...\n\n01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.560\nIt's like she was, you know, the only reason I have her photo\n\n01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.560\nis because she was bragging about the savings\n\n01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.560\nthat we've made by not, you know,\n\n01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.560\ncaring enough as much about the UN\n\n01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:30.560\nAnd Steve, which photo of Dan do you think\n\n01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.560\nwould be the easiest to masturbate to?\n\n01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.560\nProbably that one with his balls, right?\n\n01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:41.560\nIt's so easy to embarrass Steve Levy\n\n01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.560\nIt's almost unfair\n\n01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:43.560\nNo, I know, it's great\n\n01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.560\nThat's why I brought him up\n\n01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.560\nWhen you, yeah\n\n01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.560\nThat's like every group text\n\n01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.560\nLike, no matter what anybody says\n\n01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.560\nIt's like a hair trigger\n\n01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.560\nYou're going to get the monkey with his...\n\n01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.560\nThe Cino evil monkey\n\n01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.560\nYou get shy monkeys\n\n01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.560\nAnd if it's really embarrassing\n\n01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.560\nThere's also the thing that Cody and Dan\n\n01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:03.560\nOccasionally me, there's a picture of Dan\n\n01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:04.560\nwith his balls out\n\n01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.560\nIt got worse, it got worse a couple weeks ago, Jeff\n\n01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.560\nYeah, yeah, we liked it\n\n01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.560\nCody and I like to trick Steve into looking at my genitals\n\n01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.560\nAnd, uh...\n\n01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.560\nLike, Cody will take pictures of me\n\n01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.560\nin hotel rooms and stuff\n\n01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.560\nAnd then I had, there was a hotel\n\n01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.560\nAnd it had like a...\n\n01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.560\nIt had like a thing that was like...\n\n01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.560\nI don't know why it would have this\n\n01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.560\nBut it was like a thing that was...\n\n01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.560\nNo, it was a thing you put on your door knob\n\n01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.560\nOutside the hotel room\n\n01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.560\nBecause it means that you want it...\n\n01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.560\nYou want breakfast?\n\n01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.560\nThey'll take your order or something\n\n01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.560\nYeah, yeah, you fill that up in the morning\n\n01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.560\nYou fill it up before 6 a.m.\n\n01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.560\nYou hang up your door\n\n01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.560\nBut it was like, well, guess what's going through there\n\n01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.560\nAnd then like, so it's just, you know\n\n01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.560\nIt's just a circular hole that says breakfast\n\n01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.560\nAnd then I'm like, and...\n\n01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.560\nAnd so I just...\n\n01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.560\nYou could just text somebody\n\n01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.560\nYou could just send that photo to somebody\n\n01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.560\nAnd you'd be tricking them into seeing it\n\n01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.560\nBut it's like funnier to be like,\n\n01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.560\nHey, Steve, I need those tax forms\n\n01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.560\nHave you seen the thing?\n\n01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.560\nWe're in the middle of the desert\n\n01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:03.560\nAnd some random bar doing work\n\n01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.560\nAnd Cody is texting me in the street with Dan\n\n01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.560\nAnd she's like, you know, we got to do this thing\n\n01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.560\nAnd hey, can you help me with this?\n\n01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.560\nI'm going to send you some stuff that I need help on\n\n01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:15.560\nAnd then just this picture of Dan goes through\n\n01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.560\nWe're sitting at the bar in public\n\n01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:20.560\nAnd it's three or four images in a row\n\n01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.560\nIf anyone was dick through the breakfast thing\n\n01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.560\nThat kind of backfired\n\n01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.560\nThere was a guy in the back bar on these giant screens\n\n01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.560\nAnd it was just like, in the timeline\n\n01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:28.560\nI'm like, ah-ha!\n\n01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.560\nAnd there was a guy next to Dan\n\n01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.560\nWho clearly saw this picture\n\n01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.560\nThis like conservative, misogynistic guy\n\n01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.560\nWho, and we're laughing\n\n01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.560\nAnd he commented on us, like, laughing\n\n01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.560\nAnd I don't know, just...\n\n01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.560\nAnd then Dan got sucked into this horrible conversation\n\n01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.560\nI mean, didn't you guys, as Starburns,\n\n01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.560\nRecently have a sexual harassment workshop?\n\n01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:49.560\nLike, like...\n\n01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.560\nYeah, we did\n\n01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:53.560\nYeah, wait, wait, wait\n\n01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.560\nAre you...\n\n01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.560\nHow does this not qualify as full?\n\n01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.560\nIt's totally fine\n\n01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.560\nYou obviously missed the meeting\n\n01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.560\nDan had co...\n\n01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.560\nIf it has to be unwelcome\n\n01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.560\nIn order for it to be bad\n\n01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.560\nExactly, it has to be unwelcome\n\n01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.560\nAlso, technically, Cody sent it to me\n\n01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:13.560\nSo, she's not...\n\n01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.560\nShe doesn't work with me\n\n01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.560\nDan had no involvement with that at all\n\n01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.560\nHe didn't want you to see a picture of his dick\n\n01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.560\nGoing through the breakfast line\n\n01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.560\nI don't know, I think Dan texted Cody\n\n01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.560\nLike, it would be funny if he sent that picture\n\n01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.560\nI don't want to see that photo\n\n01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.560\nI'm a little sad I wasn't on that group text\n\n01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.560\nSo I feel a little left out\n\n01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.560\nBy the way, it was a pre-emptive\n\n01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:35.560\nSexual harassment seminar\n\n01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.560\nA lot of companies have them\n\n01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.560\nWe were overdue, probably\n\n01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.560\nDon't say that either\n\n01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:43.560\nI think it was right on time\n\n01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.560\nNo, because we're so good at it\n\n01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.560\nA traditional educational thing\n\n01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.560\nTo equip all of our employees\n\n01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.560\nWith the knowledge they need\n\n01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.560\nTo make a safe environment\n\n01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.560\nIt took you guys 45 minutes\n\n01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.560\nTo make your next dick joke\n\n01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.560\nIn front of everybody\n\n01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.560\nEverybody that works at a company\n\n01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.560\nThat knows that those days are the days\n\n01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.560\nThat everyone is the grossest\n\n01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.560\nBecause everybody has this camaraderie\n\n01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.560\nAnd then they're like, oh, we're going to do the sexual harassment\n\n01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.560\nAnd then people start, you know\n\n01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.560\nI'm above it\n\n01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.560\nBecause then I have a separate meeting\n\n01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.560\nWhere the lawyer comes in and goes\n\n01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.560\nOkay, here's your meeting\n\n01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.560\nHere's the number of ways\n\n01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.560\nYou can get sued for how much money\n\n01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.560\nI'm like, oh, feminist\n\n01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.560\nLike, like,
