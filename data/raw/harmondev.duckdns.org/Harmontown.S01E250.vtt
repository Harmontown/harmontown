WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Ladies and gentlemen, from beautiful Uptown, Bay Bank, Harmontown is now in session.

00:13.000 --> 00:29.000
Let's welcome to the stage the Game Master Spencer Crittendenton

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
and your Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:33.000 --> 00:41.000
Thank you very much, thank you for coming out.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
So, holiday weekend, we chicken for granted, we keep filling this place,

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
but we've got this venue now and it's not easy to get people over here.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
It's Bird Bank.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
So, all these people that keep filling the joint, we can probably do anything.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
We got them on the hook.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Who drove really far from LA? How far did you come from?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Minnesota?

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
You drove from Minnesota? See, now that's a hell of a drive.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Yeah, that's a lot harder.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
You must have left like this morning.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Yeah, who wants to go to Bird Bank from Minnesota? That's crazy.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Minnesota you from? The Twin Cities.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Which ones?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I'm kidding, of course.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Hello, Dan, how are you doing?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
I'm good, I'm good.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
You seem like you got something on your mind.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Well, no, I'm just trying to think of what I do have on my mind.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
I'm afraid I don't have anything on my mind.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
It seems like you have nothing on your mind right now.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
I'm in the midst of a deadline on a treatment that I'm supposed to turn in.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
I should have turned it up Friday and it's been one of those weekends where you saw it coming

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
and it's like, it's a four day weekend, this is going to be great.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
I got the sick dog, so I wasn't even allowed to leave the house.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
So it was really, Cody and I were like, it's going to be four days in the house,

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
like just sitting in bed and we don't even have to feel like we're bad people for doing that

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
because we got a dog to take care of.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
And then I hit Nigel.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Fuck it up.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Is Nigel all right?

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah, he's okay. Nigel, so yeah, Nigel ate like a big clump of grass

02:16.000 --> 02:25.000
and then he was in there and then, look man, so Spencer was the point there.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Hey guys.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Nigel opened.

02:30.000 --> 02:40.000
So we go into the veterinarian with the Nigel dog and the doctor comes in

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
and he's taken x-rays and then he's taken x-rays the next day so he's analyzing this thing.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
And it's like, oh, there's this thing in his stomach and he's like,

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
I thought we were bringing him in for surgery, but then the guy says, he goes,

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
well, at this point, you know, I think we should just wait because it's moving, this thing.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
And it's just like this big thing, it looks like a tube sock,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
but it looks like a tube sock because now it's in its intestine.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
So everything that you would put in there would look like a tube sock.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
You could put gold in there and it would look like a tube sock.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
It's kind of a neat idea.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
But he has this like thing and I still, I'll never know, I don't know,

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
he just kept going, like we would say, well, he's panting now and then he'd go,

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
well, you guys, he's a sick dog.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
And he just had that like lilting tone and every sentence began with you guys.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
And then we'd go, so you think we shouldn't operate on him?

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Well, you guys, we don't know.

03:40.000 --> 03:48.000
And like the fifth time he did that, I said, you do this thing where you keep saying you guys

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
and there's this tone and the message that we're getting is that you don't want any information from us.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
We're not doing anything wrong, doctor.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
We're asking questions and saying words.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Like he's getting mad at us.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
We're assuming that the science of caring for a dog since the dog can't talk,

04:09.000 --> 04:17.000
like that maybe it might involve collecting some data from us or maybe, hey, I mean, what, I mean, I was just like,

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
usually in that situation, maybe, and then maybe this is a bad habit that I have,

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
maybe I'm a bully, like when people are making me uncomfortable, making me feel bad,

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
maybe I'm accustomed to the fact that then I'll try to spotlight on it and maybe because I'm a six foot tall fat,

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
kind of dude, like maybe I get maybe I'm like spoiled, like maybe like most of the people I'm talking to,

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
maybe I wouldn't do that if I was talking to like the rock, you know, I wouldn't like adjust him, you know,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
like maybe I need to examine that.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
But I haven't thought about that because it always works because usually what the person does is they go,

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
oh, God, oh, geez, no, because the very fact of like you're just pointing out that there seems to be some kind of

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
breakdown is enough to get everybody kind of scrambled and then you reset, now you're recalibrated,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
you're communicating as humans, that's what I usually find.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
But I was like, hey, you know, you're doing this thing and it sounds like you don't want us to talk to you

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
and we don't know if we're supposed to say anything and that's all, if that's the case, then I don't know.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
And then he just kind of blinked, right?

05:15.000 --> 05:22.000
And then he was like, well, you know, he's a sick dog and he's getting us out and you know,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
my recommendation is that at this point we should wait and you know, if you guys don't like having me as a doctor,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
you know, you can get another doctor.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, but I didn't do anything.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
I was like reeling and I was like, silence, I was like, how do I react to this?

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
And during the silence Spencer goes, if you think that's best.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
Well, it wasn't like, just hold on, just hold on.

05:43.000 --> 05:50.000
I think I said that we trusted his opinion and we'll do whatever he thinks we should do or something like that.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
I don't think it was like sarcastic, like, yeah, give us another doctor.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
I think it was like, yeah, no, we trust, you're the guy.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
You're the guy to listen to.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
You don't want to piss off a doctor when your dog is sick.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
It's like you're pissing off, like a waiter can spit in your food.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
Your doctor can metaphorically spit in your dog and kill your dog.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
So that guy leaves, he just leaves.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
And then I heard him slap an animal.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
I thought when he said, if you guys want, you can see another doctor.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
I thought he was saying it like a teenager would say it like a passive aggressive kind of like,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
maybe I'll go eat some worms if you want to go eat some worms.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
And we're supposed to go, oh, no, you're a great doctor.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Which is why I was like stunned.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I didn't know what he was saying was, well, we have several doctors here.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Let me go get another one, which I guess is what he's doing.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
You can hear him faintly out there talking to another guy.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
And I'm like saying to Spencer, what is it me?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Is it you?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Is it the dog?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Is it him?

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
And I was like, I don't think he knows that he sounds passive aggressive.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I think he's just stupid in that sense.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Yeah, he had maybe an aptitude for treating dogs.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
Probably doesn't spike in the same brain statistically as an aptitude for communicating with people.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
We don't know.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
We don't know.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
There are certain fields of medicine that doctors will tell you that we're not people persons.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
We're not people people.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
We want to solve you.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
We don't want to hang out with you or talk to you.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
We don't touch you.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
We just want to open you up and look at your insights.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Sure.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Maybe this guy was like, oh, I get it.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
They're animals.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
So I can be like a savage, horrible, primal monster.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Maybe you're so ursine, and because he's a veterinarian, he thought you might actually be a bear.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Right.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
And so it was like...

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
And he came to you guys to prove that you're actually a person and not a bear.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
It was the veterinarial equivalent of a racism thing.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
He didn't really believe I was a bear, like a magic talking bear.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
I put off enough of a bear vibe that a guy who loves dogs and cats and treats their ails

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
is like, I don't like this guy.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
He looks like someone that eats on a landfill.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
And that's an enemy of the canine and the feline in my book.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
My name's not Dr. Asshole.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
So five minutes goes by and a new doctor comes in.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
And he goes, hello, my name's Dr. Ruiz.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
And that was a surprise.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
We did not expect a different doctor to come through the door.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Yeah.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
I thought maybe like a bouncer from Jerry Springer would come in or something and go,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
well, you guys got to go.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
We need this room.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
But a new doctor comes in.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Hi, I'm Dr. Ruiz.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
He shakes our hands.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
And then he starts looking at the x-rays.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
And he acts like nothing has happened.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
He goes, I'm Dr. Ruiz.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
So we're going to do some exploratory surgery on Nigel.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
We're going to go in and we're going to pull this foreign body out.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
And I'm like, what?

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
And Spencer says, okay, but what would you say if we told you that the last guy said

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
the exact opposite thing?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
And the guy says, oh, no, I know that.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
I just talked to him.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
I totally disagree with him.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
I have a totally second opinion about what you do about your dog.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Is it Anderson and Ruiz?

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
They're like, this is the thing that will plague me forever because this guy was nice.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
And I was like, yes, now we're talking.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Cut my dog open.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
See you later.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Here's $1,700.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I'll see you three days from now.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
I changed my dog's life with a scalpel and just walked out, skipping and going like,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
by the way, that first guy's a prick.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
But like, what was my part of something?

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
Were they just like, you know, like the guy comes out and he goes like, oh, we got a,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
you know, they probably have some veterinarian code for it.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
Like we got a, we got a, we got a, we got a, we got a DFI or whatever.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
Like, like, we got you, let's cut his dog open and make him pay.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
We just, is the, is the second guy, is the second guy totally inept and loved?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Do they call him the butcher of Burbank?

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
And like, but, but he's a piece of people pleaser.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
And so, and so, I was our first guy, like the Einstein of dog, dog's eating shit.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
And I was like, fuck man, you know, like, like, like, like when he's on Charlie Rose,

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Charlie Rose, I go, what do you think is the biggest problem facing veterinarian medicine?

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
I think it's, I think it's the worship of the myth of bedside manner.

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
I got to tell you, I, like, like, I, I think we're, I think we, we, we, we, these, these are patients that can't speak to us.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
And if they, I'm sorry, I'm getting upset, Charlie.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
He's like, yeah, well you're doing this thing.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
You sound kind of patronizing.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
See, it's happening again.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
But I'm telling you, I'm a good fucking dog doctor and I could have been a brilliant child doctor,

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
but nobody's going to let me near those little fuckers.

10:25.000 --> 10:33.000
Like, like, like, so I, so I, so I humble myself, I stoop, I try to do my best, no harm, I come into this stinky hospital.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
I'm dealing with these little tiny scaled down disposable patients.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
But I'm still a big prick.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
I'm still the worst guy in the hospital.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
And he's like, he's trying to save you money.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
He's like, I don't think this is a big deal.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
You're going to talk to Ruiz in 45 seconds and he loves to charge you for it.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I'll go get Jack the Ripper.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Elective dog surgery.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Well, you like feeling good about yourself.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
You want to make a best friend?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Whether it loves cutting your dog up, I'll go get him.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
So what happened?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Did Nigel get sliced open?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
And the ongoing debate was, is this going to be the world's,

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
is this going to be the end of our Meundi's relationship?

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Because is he going to pull out like a whole thing?

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
Because Nigel just eats a lot of fabric and stuff and it looked like, you know, they give the dog barium

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
and all we knew is that there's a big thing that soaked up all the barium,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
moving very slowly through him.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
So then Spencer called the hospital and then the subtext of the story,

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Spencer loves my dog more than me.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
But he said, they pulled grass out of him.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
It was just grass.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
It was a bunch of grass, yeah.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
You know, cows that take some like three whole stomachs to digest that shit.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Cellulose, you can't digest cellulose unless you're a dog.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Oh, wait, wait, no.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Dogs and humans don't talk.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
Deer and cows, they have different systems to digest cellulose.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
If you can get into the cellulose digesting game, that's like,

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Oh boy.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
That's like panning for gold.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Like, you got to make a lot of biological sacrifices.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
There's so much food in elephant poop that elephants that get hungry can eat their own poop.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
There's still that much food in their poop.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Because it's hard to break cellulose down.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
So they break down a little bit.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
It's like a very difficult thing.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
You know, I guess maybe grass at one point was like, Jesus Christ,

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
why don't we, the biosphere's toilet paper?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Like, everyone's just going to eat us?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Fine.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Try eating us now.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
And then everyone was like,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And they're like, yeah.

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
My dog, I had a crazy dog when I was a kid and ate a bean bag open

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
and ate all the little tiny Styrofoam pellets.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
Ate like as much as it could fit inside of a dog.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
And then I just kept pooping Styrofoam poop,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
which was amazing because it was like the easiest poop to pick up

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
because it was so lightweight and versatile.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
And then once I went and did one of my shoes,

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
ate the shoe, like a basketball shoe I had with one of the foot liners,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
like the little pads that goes in there, ate the thing

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
and it came out a spiral foot liner.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
It came out like, you could have put that back in the shoe.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Dogs are like fucking boa constructors.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Nigel ate a coat hanger two days before this all happened,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
which is why I thought, I was like, oh, it's a coat hanger.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
He must have wood splinters in there.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
He ate a coat hanger, a nice wooden coat hanger.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
He probably ate the grass to chase it.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
That's probably what it was.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
They ate something softer than a coat hanger.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
They do eat grass, that's what everyone keeps saying.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Well, you know they eat grass with their stomach hurts.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
I'm like, what is this information?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Why are you gain saying me?

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
They already pulled it out, what do you want me to do about that?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
You want me to go talk to the dog?

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I think they want you to not know more than they do

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
because they studied medicine and they know how to fix dogs.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Oh, well, no, I was talking about people on Twitter.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Oh, okay.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Don't do that.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
What do you think grass is thinking?

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
Evolutionarily, so grass is like a half step up from,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
because I know moss, you know, I know moss,

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
and moss is like pre-catalyzing.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
Can we have one podcast, Dan, when you're not going on your moss ramps?

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Moss is like you're basically your first plant, you know,

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
it's like the idea of like, well, why don't we maybe,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
well, what are we doing on the water all the time?

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Why don't we just like be on a rock next to the water,

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
and then like, we'll get splashed and we'll drink that,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
but then we'll get a lot more sunlight or something like that.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
And that's before the advent,

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
because then you're just limited to like the surface of things.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
And then the big step was capillary action.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
Taking advantage of water's slight negative ionic charge,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
which you will see illustrated when you do dishes

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
and try to pull your plates apart.

14:48.000 --> 14:57.000
That's a whole, that's how, but water, if it didn't have that slight charge to it,

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
then it couldn't be drawn up as far basically as you want to.

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
A redwood tree is using that slight charge to carry water all the way up,

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
probably very wrong about most of this.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
But it's the precursor.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
This, by the way, Dan briefly went to community college

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
and took a biology class, learned a lot about plants,

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
and now knows exactly this much about plants,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
but wrote a TV show about going to community college.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
But it's pretty fascinating because water has,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
the first thing you learn in biology is like,

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
well, let's talk about water first.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
It's because the water is like, oh, it's everywhere to us,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
and it's like, oh, water, fuck water.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
Each shit, water, your piece of shit, like you're just like, whatever,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
like, oh, water's here, who cares?

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Oh, it's old 80% of the earth,

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
but water is, it's a magical, a magical, it's not magical,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
that's, if I'm trying to get you interested in science,

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
I shouldn't call things magical.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
I should write a book about wizards or something,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
and if I wanted to...

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
You should write a book about wizards.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
And you know what, it's not hard!

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
It has many properties that make life on earth possible

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
if water was just a little bit different in any way.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
For instance, water expands when it freezes, so it floats,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
so a planet that goes through an ice age,

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
if water on top freezes and you get your little tiny boogins underneath,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
your little creepy fish, they can keep living,

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
all those little monsters.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Crayobugins are coming.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Crayobugins.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
And that earth thaws and we come crawling back out and we go,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
let's do this again.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Couldn't do that if...

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
You're fucking dropping some serious science on this show.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I like your pink Floyd shirt, that's very exciting.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Cody went to the Roger Waters concert.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
I guess he has like this big dick.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
She showed me pictures, did anyone go to the...

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Has anyone been into Roger Waters?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
She showed me a picture.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
When I was your age, I mean, when I was 15,

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
I was like really into the Roger Waters pink Floyd.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
It was very important to me,

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
but I never actually bothered to see a photo of him,

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
because it was pre-internet.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I didn't go type Roger Waters,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
oh, let's see how he looks, because I'm not a vain person.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
I don't live in that world.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
I thought he was probably black,

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
because he was important to me.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
And I didn't care.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
I cared enough to think he was black,

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
and positively judged him for the color of his skin.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
But anyways, he's a very fit man,

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
because he's got to be 109,

17:42.000 --> 17:49.000
and he's definitely not eating what I ate this weekend,

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
and it's like a picture of him from the thing.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
But he's got this big boner in his pants.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Cody sent me a photo, and he's like,

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
look how big his dick is,

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
and look how hard it gets from his work.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Really, you can just, like, this is very,

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
like, that's something, he wins,

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
because also he made that album,

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
and it was like, oh, hey, well, walls are important to kids,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
because they're about education or psychology.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Like, well, I'm young, I'm gonna, oh, I got it.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Oh, it's a brick in the wall.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
And then he got into his, you know,

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Steve Martin's tweeting a couple bad jokes

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
on Twitter kind of phase, where you're like,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
okay, I'm not the sharpest guy,

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
I should probably try to hire writers from here.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Like, you know, I'm getting to that age

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
where you want to start mentoring in comedy and other things.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Like, you know, you're kind of going into your

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Gandalf the Brown phase,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
kind of just going,

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
just start getting into growing basil or something.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
But at that exact age,

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
the Berlin Wall comes down,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
and Roger Waters comes out of retirement and is like,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
oh, let's do a concert for the wall,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
because it's the wall, and now you got,

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
and then Trump is like, oh, the wall,

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
and he was like, let's do it.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
He's got a perfect life,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I bet he was just out of money,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
and then Trump was like, we're gonna build a wall,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
and he was like, he slew down a fire pole,

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
or his own dick.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
In his head.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
Money.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
So Roger Waters has got a big 90-year-old car.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
He's got a giant baton in his pants.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Or he's so vain that he puts like a flashlight down there,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
because it's important.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Maybe that's like a holdover from 60s rock,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
he's like, well, you got to do it, everybody does it.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Yeah, he got his stuff, ladies.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
People did stuff, he might be an old school stuffer.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
He's probably not even thinking about it, it's like, you know.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
We should have him on the show and find out.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Pardon?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
You know people that are on tourism?

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Can you text him right now and find out how big his dick is?

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
Alright.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
I've got a little black book

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
with my poems in it.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
Got a bag, got a toothbrush, and a comb.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Stevie Nicks?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Alright.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
That was some stuff I talked about

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
at that weird show we did last week

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
at that freaky Chris Hardwick cult meeting

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
that we went to in the middle of.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
We made it out in the woods,

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
and 90% of the crowd was dressed as stormtroopers

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
or mesics, it was pretty wild.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I'll go wherever Hardwick tells me to go.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
It's called the Patriarchy, look it up.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
He's a hard wick.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
I would go, if he was a soft wick,

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
I would listen to him 10% less.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
If he had no wick at all, nope, can't be president.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
Oh, not funny.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Okay.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Too true, okay.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
We started out as a simple word play

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
and penis jokes turned into a negatively resonant

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
late motif for the ladies

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
and the men that support them.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
It wasn't like there was a bunch of guys going,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
women can't be president.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
We got a lot of enlightened people here.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Sorry, I hurt you.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
You're probably very excited then about that,

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
the fact that the 25th amendment is now going to be invoked

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
because he tweeted a meme with a CNN thing on it.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Oh, yeah?

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
We're all just so fucking, we're like,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
what are you talking, just stop.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
This was like the big turning point,

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I saw people on Twitter being like,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
even saying to guys I really like,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
they're just going like Keith Olberman going,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
look this is it.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
They tweeted a meme with a CNN

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
and there's a wrestler hitting him

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
and we must now for the 700th time

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
we must do something about this man

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
and then just like a couple people tweeting like,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
this is just like a sideshow now,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
like I don't even want to do this anymore.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
Like this thing where we pretend like you can stop the antichrist,

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
like it's not, let's just enjoy it, it's biblical,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
let's just enjoy it.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
I think it's not a cheery thought

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
but I was thinking today when I had the same reaction to that,

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
like we're going to look back fondly on today,

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
like on these days because he's not a professional tyrant.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
The next president is going to be worse than him.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
He's a clown, it's going to get worse.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
We're not going to go like, oh, this is the dark ages

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
and we're going to have an awesome president next time.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
It's going to get sadder and worse

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
but the next people are going to be pros,

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
not winging it and not being, you know,

22:39.000 --> 22:45.000
like just crappy, you know, WWF characters, you know.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
Well, it's like this monkey got loose on the paramount lot

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
and like everyone's chasing it and going,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
get back here, Bobo!

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
But Bobo is running into sound stages

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
and like turning on cameras and putting on a hat

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
and like getting a two-point rating, you know?

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
And so everyone that's, everyone chasing him

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
or cheering him on is all going, ha, that crazy monkey.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Shit, you can do that?

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Like they said, like the monkey doesn't even know

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
what it's doing, like it's running into edit bays

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
and like pressing buttons that make just like champagne

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
and coke come out on a big sliding wall

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
that was hidden from the Robert Evans era

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
and like everyone's like, okay, noted there too.

23:27.000 --> 23:34.000
So if you have more than a 90 IQ plus choose fascism,

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
you could really get some shit done in this country.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Whereas he's just going like,

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
I got lonely, I got lonely.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
So like he went throughout his life,

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
like he was the son of a fucking slumlord

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
with a trust fund, he blew through and then he tried,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
he was a Democrat and he tried to get rich people to like him

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
and rich people were like, you're tacky, you're gross,

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
like you're creepy, I heard you fucked a 13-year-old,

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
get out of here.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
And then he's like, those are allegations.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
You know, I don't have those allegations against me.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
I don't want the system to work that way

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
but I just think that you shouldn't have 13-year-olds

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
accusing you of fucking them.

24:13.000 --> 24:19.000
All right, so just Google it and like let's figure it out.

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
I don't know if the guy, he had like a preteen model agency

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
like who has that?

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
He was like, you know, he's like doing high society

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
and like, hey, I'm a big rich guy

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
and I want to hang out with the Baldwin's and the things

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
and you know, he was just kind of a joke

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
and then he's just like getting older and older

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
and then he's like, and then he's like,

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
so who in this world that's left

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
would ever just give me what Howard Stern was giving me,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
what the television show was giving me,

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
and this is like, you know, the P.T. Barnum

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
like devil character from Needful Things

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
was like, well, I got the bin over here

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
which is just hillbilly Nazis would love you.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Are you sure about that?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
That doesn't seem like a big fit to me.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
It sounds like a great sitcom.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Like no, no, they're pretty easy.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
You put on this trucker cap

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
and just start saying I'm tired of brown people.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
Like it'll catch on, believe me,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
we're right for it.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
And he's like, okay, I'll try it

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
and it fucking worked and I'm going to kill myself.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
All right.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
But yeah, I was just thinking, you know,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
it's like these people are like,

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
oh, oh, look at it, this is it.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
This is a deal breaker with the wrestling thing

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
that he tweeted because it's like so sad

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
when people are like, because it's violent imagery.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
Is he promoting violence against journalists?

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Like, well, don't play into that fucking.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
He's promoting violence against good Photoshop

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
or after effects.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
It was pretty crude.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Yeah, and the guy that did it, you know,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
and then everyone's like, well, look at the last thing

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
this guy did and it's like some Nazi shit

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
about how everyone in CNN's a Jew or whatever.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
There, I agree.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I agree with him on that one.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
You agree that everyone in CNN's a Jew?

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Well, according to his chart,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
I mean, if you only go by that,

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I don't have any other data.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
It seemed like it was scientific.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
But it was like, decrying that, I feel like,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
it was like, actually, didn't you kind of feel like

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
when he does something crazy,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
then it's like, you kind of feel like,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
what am I measuring it by?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
But it's just kind of like the Twitter's that guy's like,

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
I feel like you see a little spike in people going like,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
all right, come on, man, knock it off.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
People that voted for him going like, come on,

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
you're embarrassing me, you know?

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
But then the more that we go, that's right,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
he's embarrassing you.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
And technically, he's in violation of political correctness

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
because that's actual racism if you look it up.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
And then the person that was like, you're embarrassing me,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
goes, oh, yeah, I remember why I voted for you.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
Like, because I feel stupid and barbaric

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
and I'm tired of feeling that way,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
so instead of improving myself, I pulled a lever

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
that said I would have to put that off for four years.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
But that's us too.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
We're all lazy.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
None of us are out there doing fucking mental crunches,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
like trying to figure out how to be good people.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
I've only gotten to the point where I'm like,

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
I'm just like, oh, I was wrong about everything my entire life.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
That's possible even when you're a genius.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
So what hope do we have for morons?

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
How are they gonna flip?

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
Is there gonna be an obelisk outside of a fucking trailer park

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
and everyone that caused this problem

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
is gonna hear this high-pitched whine and touch it

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
and then throw a fucking spray paint can in the air

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
that turns into a job at a solar panel who factory?

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I want you to never stop this metaphor.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
I want this to go on for the rest of the show.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I want that to be a scene in a Kubrick movie.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
I mean, what do we think we're gonna do?

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
We're in a civil war, culturally.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
And believe me, there's just as many dumb people on both sides,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
like in laziness and like adds to dumbness.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
I was like, at this point, we're at this like impasse or something

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
and impasses don't get, they don't just sit there.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Like we used to think we were at an impasse,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
but what we were really in was like the reign of the bipartisan system,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
which I used to sit there and scoff at,

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
but we didn't know how good we had it and was like,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
oh, I want my corruption back. I want my bureaucracy back.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
I want my like, I want my fucking transparent collusion

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
between two corporations that just rig debates

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
and fucking just hang out back.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
And it's like, okay, so that system wasn't working for other people,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
so I'm guilty of these crimes, right?

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
But then again, I didn't inherit my fucking money.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
I worked for it and see, okay, now I sound Republican.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
Like, so like,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
who-who-who-who-who-who?

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
Alright.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Pit pause, hold up.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
Somebody, one of our fans, go online,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
make that, a remix.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
Whistle tip, whistle tip, who-who-who-who-who.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
That was like the EDM kind of thing.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
The, uh, yeah, well, that's what,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
it's not an impasse. That's the thing.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.200
Okay, so here's why, you kids, when grandpa,

29:14.200 --> 29:16.000
when grandpa that made Rick and Morty

29:16.000 --> 29:17.080
and it's all, it's such a bummer,

29:17.080 --> 29:21.320
why is he such a cuck, like, what are you doing?

29:21.320 --> 29:22.560
Why are you talking about politics?

29:22.560 --> 29:24.440
Why do you make this great cartoon that's like,

29:24.440 --> 29:29.120
oh, it speaks to the very heart of my alt-right

29:29.120 --> 29:33.160
or Bernie Krat or Hillary Loving or Trump Loving ass.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.640
Yeah, because I'm a genius

29:34.640 --> 29:36.680
and it's called Resonant Storytelling

29:36.680 --> 29:39.080
and timeless character craftsmanship

29:39.080 --> 29:41.280
and Justin Rowland's coattails

29:41.280 --> 29:44.400
and it's, there's a delicate recipe.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.600
Also, a lot of the background art

29:46.600 --> 29:49.120
looks like Dick's balls and vaginas.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.720
But when you're all bummed out, like,

29:50.720 --> 29:53.120
oh, why aren't you, oh, you used to be so fun.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.000
I'm sure that's not true, first of all.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.280
I'm sure, I don't remember,

29:57.280 --> 29:59.600
but I don't think I was like a laugh a minute

29:59.600 --> 30:01.120
when I was not political.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.320
I was probably just gross or something.

30:03.320 --> 30:04.440
I was probably just going like,

30:04.440 --> 30:08.640
is it me or bananas fitting in your ass wrong

30:08.640 --> 30:09.480
or something?

30:09.480 --> 30:10.800
That sounds fun.

30:10.800 --> 30:11.800
I couldn't rift for the thing.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.120
I didn't want to like...

30:13.120 --> 30:14.880
But like, like, are you guys...

30:14.880 --> 30:16.440
Which end is the wrong end of the banana

30:16.440 --> 30:17.440
to put in your ass first?

30:17.440 --> 30:18.800
Do you think?

30:18.800 --> 30:21.200
The banana is the atheist's worst nightmare.

30:21.200 --> 30:22.040
Google it.

30:22.040 --> 30:22.880
Uh...

30:22.880 --> 30:23.960
Oh!

30:23.960 --> 30:26.080
The, uh, the, uh...

30:26.080 --> 30:27.280
Like, when you're all bummed out

30:27.280 --> 30:29.120
and you're going like, Dan, what is politics?

30:29.120 --> 30:30.640
See, here's why you're doing that.

30:30.640 --> 30:31.720
Here's why you're thinking that.

30:31.720 --> 30:34.360
And I understand this because you're younger than me

30:34.360 --> 30:37.720
and I'm not implying that when you get older, you know more.

30:37.720 --> 30:40.120
I'm saying like, I've lived longer.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.600
So if you've lived longer,

30:41.600 --> 30:45.560
so imagine like you're listening to a, uh,

30:45.560 --> 30:48.720
a 10 minute song, okay?

30:48.720 --> 30:52.480
And so, and you're, you walk into the room

30:52.480 --> 30:55.640
and it's been playing for eight minutes,

30:55.640 --> 30:59.560
but now you're hearing your first minute of it.

30:59.560 --> 31:03.080
If, if the people that have been in that room longer

31:03.080 --> 31:06.560
are saying, I think this song is ending,

31:06.560 --> 31:07.880
listen to them.

31:07.880 --> 31:10.920
They have gotten more of a feel for it.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.360
It doesn't, it's not so much like,

31:12.360 --> 31:13.760
oh, you're so much smarter.

31:13.760 --> 31:15.240
Your IQ keeps growing.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.640
Saying, this doesn't happen.

31:17.640 --> 31:18.640
I think everyone keeps saying that.

31:18.640 --> 31:21.520
I'm like, it's like, I know the difference between like,

31:21.520 --> 31:24.760
oh, the dangling chads and the abortion arguments

31:24.760 --> 31:26.080
and the gays in the military

31:26.080 --> 31:28.400
and the Republican Democrat and just out and out.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.200
Like, we're, we're, we're having a little bit

31:31.200 --> 31:34.600
of a problem here that has really actually nothing to do

31:34.600 --> 31:36.600
with what we used to call politics

31:36.600 --> 31:40.040
because that word has for 44 years, to me,

31:40.040 --> 31:43.160
has meant the boring thing, the grownup thing,

31:43.160 --> 31:45.840
the part of the scam, part of the thing.

31:45.840 --> 31:49.320
But politics now, it's like actually like,

31:49.320 --> 31:52.880
I mean, there's only, once this stops being the case

31:52.880 --> 31:54.920
where everyone's like all freaked out,

31:54.920 --> 31:59.440
like it's not, it's gonna be like people,

31:59.440 --> 32:01.520
you're gonna be wearing like jumpsuits and stuff

32:01.520 --> 32:02.720
and we're gonna be like walking

32:02.720 --> 32:04.680
like stainless steel honeycombs,

32:04.680 --> 32:07.440
like deep beneath a Mars station

32:07.440 --> 32:08.760
and they're gonna be being, well,

32:08.760 --> 32:10.240
I'm not making it sound cool.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.520
We're never gonna get to Mars because,

32:14.520 --> 32:17.760
because whoever comes after Trump is gonna be,

32:17.760 --> 32:20.000
like is gonna win by opposing gravity,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
like as a, people are gonna be like,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.440
yeah, why are you libtards always talking

32:24.440 --> 32:27.240
about how there's gravity if you want to get the space?

32:30.240 --> 32:32.440
Did you see how stupid that is?

32:32.440 --> 32:36.560
Oh, here's the, here's a meme of a gorilla going,

32:36.560 --> 32:38.400
hmm, I wanna go into space.

32:38.400 --> 32:43.400
I think I'll say that nothing can go up forever.

32:43.840 --> 32:44.680
That's you.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.080
Because the world will be an ocean

32:51.080 --> 32:53.680
and they'll be like, okay, well, we were wrong.

32:53.680 --> 32:56.200
Yeah, okay, we were wrong about the polar ice caps, you know,

32:56.200 --> 33:00.200
but what is this gravity you're always talking about?

33:00.200 --> 33:02.840
I see if you're poor and you wanna get into space,

33:02.840 --> 33:03.800
just jump.

33:05.120 --> 33:08.280
If you believe in yourself, you should be able to fly.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.520
Well, technically, you know, no, no egg head.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.600
You fucking sell out, you traitor.

33:16.800 --> 33:17.640
Jew!

33:19.560 --> 33:21.880
I know it, I haven't checked my chart yet,

33:22.720 --> 33:25.200
but you got that fucking Jurassic Park vibe.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.040
What?

33:29.640 --> 33:31.160
Which character?

33:31.160 --> 33:32.920
It's which character?

33:35.040 --> 33:36.040
Goldblum?

33:36.040 --> 33:37.920
Yeah, the Stegosaurus.

33:40.760 --> 33:42.480
You better wake up, motherfucker.

33:44.920 --> 33:49.920
Did you see that fucking holy shit in a bottle?

33:49.920 --> 33:51.920
Did you see that NRA video?

33:51.920 --> 33:54.240
There was like, whoa!

33:54.240 --> 33:57.920
Oh, yeah, see, it's over, like, not over,

33:57.920 --> 34:01.160
like, I mean, over, like, like, schools out,

34:01.160 --> 34:04.520
like, they're saying, like, it's over,

34:04.520 --> 34:07.320
everybody do what you gotta do,

34:07.320 --> 34:10.320
so that's a cue for activists to do.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.280
That video was like what's playing on a TV

34:12.280 --> 34:14.240
in the background in Robocop 2.

34:14.240 --> 34:15.080
Like, would you, would you?

34:15.080 --> 34:18.800
Yeah, so much far beyond that, it was crazy.

34:18.800 --> 34:21.800
And here's the craziest thing about that video, to me.

34:21.800 --> 34:24.640
When those guys, like, there's a,

34:24.640 --> 34:28.360
when somebody goes into a school and shoots like 20 people,

34:28.360 --> 34:30.200
and then their response is,

34:31.760 --> 34:34.240
well, I'll tell you this much.

34:34.240 --> 34:38.160
If the teachers had guns, they would only be 10,

34:38.160 --> 34:39.480
yeah, okay, all right, okay.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.400
So everybody should have had a gun.

34:41.400 --> 34:43.040
Okay, all right, well, for a second there, we thought,

34:43.040 --> 34:46.520
no, yeah, let's see, everybody should have a gun.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.280
Okay, got it, I get it, I get it.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.920
There's almost an honesty there, like,

34:50.920 --> 34:52.200
I don't know if they believe it or not,

34:52.200 --> 34:53.560
but their message is transparent.

34:53.560 --> 34:55.960
They're going, oh, 20 kids got shot,

34:55.960 --> 34:58.840
so everyone should have a gun.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.800
There is no hidden agenda.

35:00.800 --> 35:03.240
That video, they're saying,

35:03.240 --> 35:06.240
they're pretending that they think

35:06.240 --> 35:09.960
that because police can't quell disruption enough

35:09.960 --> 35:12.360
on their own without causing more of it,

35:12.360 --> 35:15.720
that if there's any psychos out there with their ears on,

35:15.720 --> 35:18.000
you might wanna just start DIYing it.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.920
That might actually work.

35:19.920 --> 35:21.320
That's the unspoken implication,

35:21.320 --> 35:23.680
is like, you should jump in

35:23.680 --> 35:25.640
because the government's hands are tied.

35:25.640 --> 35:26.920
They're cucked out, man.

35:26.920 --> 35:30.760
Like, they gotta do these Miranda's and all these things,

35:30.760 --> 35:32.520
and then at the minute they poke some of the stick,

35:32.520 --> 35:34.680
if they're wearing a badge, then there's more protest.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.280
It's like, it's crazy.

35:36.280 --> 35:38.360
So, you know, and then they end it with like,

35:38.360 --> 35:40.160
now more than ever, you gotta just like,

35:40.160 --> 35:41.440
you gotta fucking hit.

35:41.440 --> 35:46.440
So they're saying to their base,

35:46.720 --> 35:49.800
like, if you're out of your goddamn mind

35:49.800 --> 35:54.640
and you pop off, it could be a solution.

35:54.640 --> 35:56.560
And they know that that's not true.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.360
They know that that person will go to prison,

35:58.360 --> 36:01.120
and they know there will be even more disruption

36:01.120 --> 36:04.200
and embollement and civil war and stuff.

36:04.200 --> 36:07.400
And they, I mean, it's like,

36:07.400 --> 36:09.600
it's almost admirable and it's villainy.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.040
I mean, they're so committed.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.200
Like, I'm pretty sure, like,

36:12.200 --> 36:13.720
they're about six months from going,

36:13.720 --> 36:16.680
okay, now we've been putting this off for 60 years,

36:16.680 --> 36:20.880
we're finally gonna like, put one foot on each dolphin here

36:20.880 --> 36:24.000
and we're gonna start being actively marketing

36:24.000 --> 36:25.440
to liberals as well.

36:25.440 --> 36:27.160
Cause they're gonna, they're gonna have another video

36:27.160 --> 36:30.800
coming up, man, it's open season on you motherfuckers.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.000
It's like, you can't go to a protest these days

36:33.000 --> 36:36.560
without worrying about who's gonna shoot you, am I right?

36:36.560 --> 36:39.040
Well, they already did that, you bought a gun.

36:39.040 --> 36:40.040
They already did it to me.

36:40.040 --> 36:44.560
It's called white male fragility, not white male endurance.

36:44.560 --> 36:46.760
I'm not gonna be the last person to buy a gun.

36:48.760 --> 36:51.880
I'm like that little mercury thing that explodes

36:51.880 --> 36:55.400
when something gets a little too hot because there's a fire.

36:55.400 --> 36:58.080
But you're gonna, you haven't even, have you shot it yet?

36:58.080 --> 36:58.920
Have you taken it?

36:58.920 --> 36:59.880
I didn't get it to shoot it.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.920
I got it to wait till someone shoots me.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.320
Yeah, but you're gonna get it.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.400
Someone's gonna come on your doorstep

37:06.400 --> 37:09.360
with a burning pitchfork and, cause that's the thing.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.120
You think pitchforks are dangerous.

37:11.120 --> 37:13.120
When you light the chips of the pitchfork on fire,

37:13.120 --> 37:16.120
you've got a real problem on your hands.

37:16.120 --> 37:20.160
Yeah, in ancient times, angry mobs needed torches

37:20.160 --> 37:21.880
and pitchforks, it was a mess.

37:21.880 --> 37:22.880
And then...

37:22.880 --> 37:25.360
It took us like, why did it take us so long?

37:25.360 --> 37:27.480
I think it was Eli Whitney who found out

37:27.480 --> 37:29.680
that if you combine fire and the pitchfork...

37:29.680 --> 37:33.640
You get a flaming trident, the ultimate angry mob facility.

37:33.640 --> 37:36.400
And if you can combine that with writing two dolphins

37:36.400 --> 37:40.280
at the same time, you might be the most terrifying

37:40.280 --> 37:42.200
individual in mythology.

37:42.200 --> 37:45.840
You're certainly not a redneck, that's for sure.

37:45.840 --> 37:48.160
If you were pitchforks on fire,

37:48.160 --> 37:49.200
and you could still write two dolphins...

37:49.200 --> 37:51.960
You write it on two dolphins,

37:51.960 --> 37:55.440
and the way you express your frustration

37:55.440 --> 38:01.440
with the ruling class or a monster is a flaming trident.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.440
You're probably not a redneck.

38:02.440 --> 38:03.440
You're probably not a redneck.

38:03.440 --> 38:06.280
You might be like Prince Namor, I don't know.

38:06.280 --> 38:10.280
You might be from like Mount Olympus.

38:10.280 --> 38:12.720
But did you notice that jumped the shark, that invention,

38:12.720 --> 38:13.720
angry mobs?

38:13.720 --> 38:15.720
They just stopped...

38:15.720 --> 38:19.680
You never see the flaming trident used in angry mobbery.

38:19.680 --> 38:24.480
Well, Egypt kind of did it, like the Arab Spring kind of thing.

38:24.480 --> 38:27.640
They went full on, like, angry mob shit.

38:27.640 --> 38:28.640
They went strung the best deal.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.640
They have flaming tridents?

38:29.640 --> 38:30.640
I don't know.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.120
They probably have the modern equivalent of that.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.800
All right, well, we'll get back to that.

38:34.800 --> 38:36.200
Wait, what were we talking about?

38:36.200 --> 38:38.920
I'm just saying, you're going to wait until somebody

38:38.920 --> 38:45.240
comes up at your place with a weapon to take your dog or something,

38:45.240 --> 38:47.440
and then you're going to pick up your gun, like Woody Allen's going to fly

38:47.440 --> 38:49.440
apart because you don't know how to use it.

38:49.440 --> 38:50.440
You have to go...

38:50.440 --> 38:53.600
I've already field stripped it and cleaned it and put it back together.

38:53.600 --> 38:56.640
What I don't know how to do is get the little rockets

38:56.640 --> 39:00.160
inside the clippy thing.

39:00.160 --> 39:01.240
I can't...

39:01.240 --> 39:04.160
I can get one in, and then I'm like, really?

39:04.160 --> 39:05.160
It's this...

39:05.160 --> 39:06.160
You have to push this hard?

39:06.160 --> 39:07.160
I'm pretty sure...

39:07.160 --> 39:08.160
It's going to shoot!

39:08.160 --> 39:09.160
I don't know.

39:09.160 --> 39:13.400
You can go on Google and type in how to put rockets in clippy bits and you'll...

39:13.400 --> 39:16.840
I'm scared to load the magazine because also it's like that's, you know,

39:16.840 --> 39:19.160
now you're actually loading a gun in your house.

39:19.160 --> 39:20.160
I haven't gotten that far yet.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.160
I just put...

39:21.160 --> 39:22.160
I was like, I wonder if I know how to...

39:22.160 --> 39:23.160
No, you do it.

39:23.160 --> 39:24.160
It takes some thumb strength to get those...

39:24.160 --> 39:25.160
I don't know.

39:25.160 --> 39:27.800
I got to get these little bad boys ready for the revolution.

39:27.800 --> 39:31.200
Yeah, look, man, I don't know what to tell you.

39:31.200 --> 39:36.200
I'm not a role model.

39:36.200 --> 39:41.600
I got two dogs and a girlfriend, and I live on a big house on a hill with a lot of fresh

39:41.600 --> 39:43.440
water in it.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.440
I got a gun.

39:45.440 --> 39:48.280
I got a hammer in case a nail comes loose.

39:48.280 --> 39:51.800
You just told however many people listen to our podcast that you don't know how to load

39:51.800 --> 39:52.800
it.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.000
So it's not really...

39:55.000 --> 39:58.720
I don't know what kind of security level you think you're at right now.

39:58.720 --> 40:02.120
Maybe I'm all the way passed into the world where I'm setting traps.

40:02.120 --> 40:03.120
Have you ever played?

40:03.120 --> 40:08.280
Maybe I'm like Jigsaw, maybe I'm like playing like lame, lame, lame, wounded duck or whatever

40:08.280 --> 40:09.280
you call it.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.280
Spencer, have you fired a weapon before?

40:10.280 --> 40:11.280
Have you fired a gun?

40:11.280 --> 40:15.960
I feel like when I was a kid I fired a gun in like a camping trip or something.

40:15.960 --> 40:19.600
How much fresh water did you say was in your house, Dan?

40:19.600 --> 40:22.360
Look, you don't need a gun if you want to take my water.

40:22.360 --> 40:26.320
I just want an estimate of how much fresh water you think you have on your...

40:26.320 --> 40:29.600
I keep forgetting to cancel my sparklets or my Arrowhead delivery.

40:29.600 --> 40:33.960
Can I go out of town on all these shows all the time, so I've got... I have a gigantic

40:33.960 --> 40:36.160
pyramid of bottles of water.

40:36.160 --> 40:38.920
So the real fresh water is a jet sauce.

40:38.920 --> 40:43.120
I feel like I used to have that, but I got these cameras installed because I'm Batman

40:43.120 --> 40:48.320
and now that I got the camera, I swear I thought I saw...

40:48.320 --> 40:49.320
Put it to chat.

40:49.320 --> 40:54.040
I thought I saw... Google it, it's a great...

40:54.040 --> 40:59.560
I thought I could swear I saw the sparklets guy or whatever you call him now, the Nestle

40:59.560 --> 41:14.360
mobile oil guy, whatever fucking... the Pentagon ministry of drinkables, Centaurian, a five-gallon

41:14.360 --> 41:19.880
drum of water, and I was watching him on the camera, like Phil Spector, just like playing

41:19.880 --> 41:30.600
with my gun and just watching him because he had kind of a Cuban vibe.

41:30.600 --> 41:37.240
And I swear it was like he came up and then I saw... I thought he left with water.

41:37.240 --> 41:38.520
He took my water.

41:38.520 --> 41:39.800
I think they take it now.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.480
He might take empty ones?

41:41.480 --> 41:46.520
He take... no, he was like... it was heavy, like he was like, oh, this water I brought

41:46.520 --> 41:47.520
up.

41:47.520 --> 41:49.480
I don't... I think he took my water.

41:49.480 --> 41:52.000
I don't know what happened, so I don't know why I should...

41:52.000 --> 41:56.840
Maybe he brought too many, and then I was like, oh, I got to take this back.

41:56.840 --> 42:01.600
I got to remember to call them... I canceled it for I forget how many months because I've

42:01.600 --> 42:04.240
got 9,000 things of water in my place.

42:04.240 --> 42:08.520
You're not supposed to do Nestle, by the way, you know, if you're interested in your consumer

42:08.520 --> 42:13.080
dollars advocating because, boy, we're still at that stage.

42:13.080 --> 42:20.000
It's not at all like the branches of government are collapsing into a fucking murder van that's

42:20.000 --> 42:26.920
going to drive around, but if it was 1999 and you thought the way you spent your next

42:26.920 --> 42:34.600
water dollar would influence the totally fair, capitalistic biosphere in the... the Nestle

42:34.600 --> 42:40.240
guy, like, he's on record as saying in interviews like, yeah, I don't get it, I don't understand

42:40.240 --> 42:43.080
why water is considered a natural resource.

42:43.080 --> 42:44.080
That doesn't make any sense.

42:44.080 --> 42:45.080
It's a product.

42:45.080 --> 42:46.080
Everybody buys it.

42:46.080 --> 42:47.080
You need it.

42:47.080 --> 42:48.080
You drink it.

42:48.080 --> 42:49.080
Looks like a candy bar.

42:49.080 --> 42:54.000
They also... they're also like... they're trying to buy up all this water that's like

42:54.000 --> 42:58.880
cheap, that's like reservoirs and stuff, and they're getting these crazy deals for it,

42:58.880 --> 43:01.840
and they're just... they're going to profit off of it, but the water they're buying is

43:01.840 --> 43:06.920
so cheap, it's like you could start a Kickstarter and buy the water for like cheaper than them,

43:06.920 --> 43:10.800
except, you know, we're not corporations, so we don't have access to these markets,

43:10.800 --> 43:16.280
but it's like we could buy that water that we don't want Nestle to buy from us, but,

43:16.280 --> 43:20.600
you know, they won't let us do it.

43:20.600 --> 43:21.600
It's fucked up.

43:21.600 --> 43:24.000
Got to put all your money into Arrowhead.

43:24.000 --> 43:30.960
They're a Native American tribe that makes their own water out of...

43:30.960 --> 43:37.960
Out of rain.

43:37.960 --> 43:40.000
They also make salt.

43:40.000 --> 43:48.840
I'm so glad I didn't think of that because I would have said it.

43:48.840 --> 43:49.840
Okay.

43:49.840 --> 43:50.840
What... what...

43:50.840 --> 43:51.840
What is that?

43:51.840 --> 43:55.880
Can we hear Sam Elliott's commercial for the fully-croisoned...

43:55.880 --> 43:59.840
Hello, I'm Sam Elliott for Arrowhead Water.

43:59.840 --> 44:05.640
You know, our water's salty, and here's the reason why.

44:05.640 --> 44:08.520
Andrew Jackson... no, no, no.

44:08.520 --> 44:18.680
80% of your body can't be wrong.

44:18.680 --> 44:21.240
That's just general water advertising, I don't know.

44:21.240 --> 44:23.440
It's not for trail and tears.

44:23.440 --> 44:27.640
The trail and tears was, of course, a horrible thing that would be totally offensive, but...

44:27.640 --> 44:29.120
But we made it delightful, just like...

44:29.120 --> 44:36.640
Well, also, it's like history's written by the winners, and we're not afraid of the...

44:36.640 --> 44:39.000
That's my apology to anyone who is listening that's like...

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
That's a little hurtful.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
I'm like...

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
I'm sorry.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Like...

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
Also...

44:44.000 --> 44:49.440
You know, because it shouldn't be a numbers game, like, you know, like, what's offensive,

44:49.440 --> 44:50.440
you know?

44:50.440 --> 44:54.640
It shouldn't be like, oh, that group isn't going to a million-man march us, so...

44:54.640 --> 44:55.640
You recently made a...

44:55.640 --> 44:57.160
I thought I'd tell a putty tent reference.

44:57.160 --> 45:03.120
They don't think you're current, but you're a baby boomer.

45:03.120 --> 45:07.680
You still, you know, you're still loud.

45:07.680 --> 45:09.640
Why is it now?

45:09.640 --> 45:16.520
Just hear those sleigh bells tingle in the ring, ting tingle in the...

45:16.520 --> 45:18.160
Dan's got ice stuck to his bottle.

45:18.160 --> 45:24.400
I've never seen that much ice stick to anything.

45:24.400 --> 45:27.520
Should we bring up our... let's bring up two of our friends so we can...

45:27.520 --> 45:28.520
Yeah.

45:28.520 --> 45:29.520
Hell yeah.

45:29.520 --> 45:31.880
Let's bring up Abed Gheith and Kali Fontecchio.

45:31.880 --> 45:32.880
Yeah.

45:32.880 --> 45:33.880
Got Callie.

45:33.880 --> 45:34.880
Callie and Abed.

45:34.880 --> 45:35.880
Hey, buddy.

45:35.880 --> 45:36.880
Oh, my God.

45:36.880 --> 45:37.880
Look at that.

45:37.880 --> 45:38.880
Kali Kazoo and real Abed too.

45:38.880 --> 45:39.880
It's a double whammy.

45:39.880 --> 45:40.880
There's a cloud underneath this crazy...

45:40.880 --> 45:41.880
What the fuck?

45:41.880 --> 45:42.880
What the fuck?

45:42.880 --> 45:43.880
It's a cloud of ice.

45:43.880 --> 45:44.880
Cloud of ice.

45:44.880 --> 45:45.880
What the fuck?

45:45.880 --> 45:46.880
What the fuck?

45:46.880 --> 45:47.880
It's a cloud of ice.

45:47.880 --> 45:48.880
What the fuck?

45:48.880 --> 45:49.880
It's a cloud of ice.

45:49.880 --> 45:50.880
What the fuck?

45:50.880 --> 45:51.880
It's a cloud of ice.

45:51.880 --> 45:52.880
What the fuck?

45:52.880 --> 45:53.880
It's a cloud of ice.

45:53.880 --> 45:54.880
What the fuck?

45:54.880 --> 45:55.880
It's a cloud of ice.

45:55.880 --> 45:56.880
Did you not notice that when you were sitting?

45:56.880 --> 45:57.880
I was focused on the Fontecchio and I was like...

45:57.880 --> 46:02.800
You got the last thing right, which is a big, like a big, you know, that's a big achievement.

46:02.800 --> 46:04.640
I've never said your last name.

46:04.640 --> 46:05.640
Thank you.

46:05.640 --> 46:06.640
You said it correctly.

46:06.640 --> 46:07.640
He said it now, just now.

46:07.640 --> 46:08.640
Yeah.

46:08.640 --> 46:09.640
Were you named?

46:09.640 --> 46:10.640
We both have unpronounceable names.

46:10.640 --> 46:14.640
Were you named after Callie, like the God of Destruction or whatever?

46:14.640 --> 46:15.640
God of Destruction.

46:15.640 --> 46:18.640
Usually, he always shake his hand when I come up.

46:18.640 --> 46:19.640
Okay.

46:19.640 --> 46:20.640
Sorry I had to do that.

46:20.640 --> 46:21.640
Glad we didn't miss that moment.

46:21.640 --> 46:22.640
It's a ritual.

46:22.640 --> 46:24.280
No, I was like two seconds.

46:24.280 --> 46:26.160
No, it was important.

46:26.160 --> 46:27.160
Very important.

46:27.160 --> 46:29.160
I did it every time I came up here.

46:29.160 --> 46:30.160
Including now.

46:30.160 --> 46:31.840
I'm going to keep the tradition going.

46:31.840 --> 46:32.840
Eat that, Mike.

46:32.840 --> 46:33.840
All right.

46:33.840 --> 46:34.840
Thanks.

46:34.840 --> 46:37.480
Callie, you're looking very smart with your fuzzy Simpsons bag.

46:37.480 --> 46:38.480
Thank you.

46:38.480 --> 46:42.480
It's a Selma and Patty, yeah.

46:42.480 --> 46:43.480
It's nice.

46:43.480 --> 46:45.640
My favorite part is their unshaved legs.

46:45.640 --> 46:46.640
How's that?

46:46.640 --> 46:47.640
Selma.

46:47.640 --> 46:48.640
Patty and Selma.

46:48.640 --> 46:50.880
Did you purchase this or is there something you created?

46:50.880 --> 46:51.880
Oh, no.

46:51.880 --> 46:52.880
I didn't purchase this.

46:52.880 --> 46:56.240
It's a purse slash pillow.

46:56.240 --> 46:58.640
I guess when you pass out at parties, you need that.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.640
Yeah.

46:59.640 --> 47:01.320
Because then you can just use a pillow that isn't there.

47:01.320 --> 47:02.320
Tell me.

47:02.320 --> 47:03.320
There's never a pillow.

47:03.320 --> 47:04.320
I passed out at a party recently.

47:04.320 --> 47:05.320
No pillow.

47:05.320 --> 47:06.320
Oh, boy.

47:06.320 --> 47:08.320
I remember you talked to a guy I passed out at a party, but you didn't care.

47:08.320 --> 47:09.320
Oh, yeah.

47:09.320 --> 47:10.320
That was Rod Hasler.

47:10.320 --> 47:11.320
Oh, my God.

47:11.320 --> 47:12.320
That's just good.

47:12.320 --> 47:13.320
That story's never going away.

47:13.320 --> 47:14.320
Jesus.

47:14.320 --> 47:15.320
It's like the okay corralor.

47:15.320 --> 47:18.240
It's like you shot a match off a buffalo's back or something.

47:18.240 --> 47:21.400
Why the fuck does that story keep coming up all the time?

47:21.400 --> 47:25.840
I'll tell you why by telling you the story.

47:25.840 --> 47:32.000
It was a Halloween party or no, it was a wizard party and you and everybody came dressed like

47:32.000 --> 47:36.280
actual wizards like cone hats, like moons and stars and wands and stuff like that.

47:36.280 --> 47:40.440
Me and Justin, we just went to a thrift store and found random shit and then he was the

47:40.440 --> 47:45.120
wizard of cell phone technology and I was the wizard of the past or something.

47:45.120 --> 47:46.680
I had like an Indian outfit.

47:46.680 --> 47:47.960
I mean the Native American outfit.

47:47.960 --> 47:48.960
Oh shit, sorry.

47:48.960 --> 47:52.400
The party's winding down, people are getting kind of high, there's like maybe nine people

47:52.400 --> 47:53.400
were tired.

47:53.400 --> 47:56.960
There's just a bunch of out of shape wizards like sitting in the kind of like main area

47:56.960 --> 47:57.960
of the party.

47:57.960 --> 48:00.800
Because it was a full on wizard dance party, it was just wizards, just dancing.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.000
Yeah, dude, it was fun, man.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
I had a great time.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
I love seeing wizards in parties.

48:04.000 --> 48:10.280
All of our mana has worn down, we're regenerating it and we're just talking and at some point

48:10.280 --> 48:14.240
somebody goes like, all right, I'm going to keep talking to you like this because I don't

48:14.240 --> 48:22.080
want to make a big deal out of it, but I want you to at some point look over to the other

48:22.080 --> 48:23.080
room.

48:23.080 --> 48:24.360
It was Rob, wasn't it?

48:24.360 --> 48:31.000
Where Abed is sitting in a director chair like next to our friend Rod Hasler who is also

48:31.000 --> 48:35.840
sitting in a director's chair only like at that point like Rod, he's like, watch, Abed

48:35.840 --> 48:42.520
is talking to Rod and Rod, excuse me, Rod is just, he's falling asleep, like he's not

48:42.520 --> 48:50.200
always sleeping, but like his head keeps like, if you were talking to somebody and they went

48:50.200 --> 48:51.200
like that.

48:51.200 --> 49:00.240
He was slightly awake, maybe he's a bad listener, but that's where heroism comes in.

49:00.240 --> 49:04.760
By the time that passed around to me and like everybody just looked over there, don't make

49:04.760 --> 49:07.640
a big deal, I looked over and Rod was completely comatose.

49:07.640 --> 49:11.600
He kept getting funnier and funnier, he says his head was dangling like an apple on an

49:11.600 --> 49:12.600
apple tree.

49:12.600 --> 49:13.600
Well, that's my fault.

49:13.600 --> 49:18.880
His head was like parallel to the floor, like there was no mistaking this man for conscious.

49:18.880 --> 49:23.400
I wanted to work stories and also there was a point because you were talking and like everyone

49:23.400 --> 49:26.480
was watching you, but we couldn't quite hear what you were saying, but there was a point

49:26.480 --> 49:32.840
where you were, his head was just dangling over the arm of the chair and we were all

49:32.840 --> 49:40.120
watching you and then at a certain point you reacted to him as if he had like interrupted

49:40.120 --> 49:41.120
you or something.

49:41.120 --> 49:47.440
Like he had made a good point that allowed you to, well, that's a different matter.

49:47.440 --> 49:51.040
He was listening, but he's slightly zoned out.

49:51.040 --> 49:54.440
Like maybe he snored or something and they're like, well, speaking of that.

49:54.440 --> 49:56.480
Well, I thought he was still awake.

49:56.480 --> 49:59.960
So then he did some motion that I'm like, you can't do what I'm saying.

49:59.960 --> 50:00.960
How could you?

50:00.960 --> 50:01.960
What in the weekend at Bernie's?

50:01.960 --> 50:02.960
Were you talking about Farscape?

50:02.960 --> 50:07.920
No, I was talking about, well, we worked together at the time on Mansers and I was saying stuff

50:07.920 --> 50:11.440
like, do people at work like me, am I annoying?

50:11.440 --> 50:15.240
And I think like I was trying to get validation that people liked me at work.

50:15.240 --> 50:18.520
So I was like confused because they treated me weird there.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.520
So I'm like, come on, they like me, right?

50:20.520 --> 50:27.440
And I think he phased out at a certain point, but I was so passionate about what I was talking

50:27.440 --> 50:29.560
about that I didn't notice he passed out.

50:29.560 --> 50:31.360
So yeah, you guys saw that.

50:31.360 --> 50:32.360
You saw me.

50:32.360 --> 50:36.200
I mean, he was awake two seconds ago and then in those two seconds he fell asleep.

50:36.200 --> 50:39.280
Well, thank you for saying the words pass out so that we could all remember to mock

50:39.280 --> 50:41.640
you for that same thing for like 11 years ago.

50:41.640 --> 50:45.200
Look, it was weird because you guys looked over at the right comedic moment where it

50:45.200 --> 50:46.200
was funny.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.880
No, no, we were watching you for 45 minutes.

50:47.880 --> 50:50.080
Like there was no, it wasn't a window.

50:50.080 --> 50:51.320
Oh, you got it.

50:51.320 --> 50:52.320
Just the right time.

50:52.320 --> 50:53.320
Like Planet Earth.

50:53.320 --> 50:56.160
Like, oh man, that Orca just left up for real.

50:56.160 --> 50:59.080
We were all playing it cool, but marvelling.

50:59.080 --> 51:03.280
You kind of had your head down and you were making a point about Ben Fold's live or something.

51:03.280 --> 51:04.800
And so it was a record or whatever.

51:04.800 --> 51:06.720
And he was completely dead.

51:06.720 --> 51:13.360
You were trying to do a corpse and we're like, he's in heaven right now.

51:13.360 --> 51:14.360
I'm so embarrassed.

51:14.360 --> 51:17.120
I mean, because the weird thing is later when you guys said you were watching the whole

51:17.120 --> 51:19.680
time, I was like, I didn't remember.

51:19.680 --> 51:22.600
I did talk to him, but I mean, we were all asleep.

51:22.600 --> 51:24.720
It was the end of a very long drunken party.

51:24.720 --> 51:28.160
So everybody gets a pass on that one, but it was, it was, it was delightful.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.440
It sounds like we're making fun of you.

51:29.440 --> 51:31.440
It was, it kind of.

51:31.440 --> 51:32.680
For you guys, it was delightful.

51:32.680 --> 51:34.440
I mean, I don't, I was like.

51:34.440 --> 51:39.880
It was almost like watching as a superhero, like, like, like you, you, that's weird.

51:39.880 --> 51:43.200
I mean, we make fun of like, like, I look, I was thinking, I can talk to people while

51:43.200 --> 51:44.200
they sleep.

51:44.200 --> 51:45.200
I'm a superhero.

51:45.200 --> 51:47.880
I, I, like, I was, because I was writing this treatment and there's this character

51:47.880 --> 51:50.480
in the thing that Mike McMahon and I are talking about.

51:50.480 --> 51:54.040
And like, we're talking about the character and we're like, oh, he's a, he's a character

51:54.040 --> 51:55.680
that's kind of deluded himself.

51:55.680 --> 51:57.680
And then we're talking about that.

51:57.680 --> 52:03.520
And then we're, it was like, we, we, it was like, we, I was like, I was like, yeah,

52:03.520 --> 52:06.360
you know, he's like, he's living his dreams.

52:06.360 --> 52:07.360
He's living his character.

52:07.360 --> 52:11.440
He's living in his dreams as a, but, and it's like a fine line between that and living

52:11.440 --> 52:12.440
a lie.

52:12.440 --> 52:16.880
And I think the, the difference is, well, what are you making other people lie?

52:16.880 --> 52:19.440
And if they say that you're lying, do you get mad at them?

52:19.440 --> 52:23.520
And I was like, oh, that's, I think that we would all admit if the stakes weren't so high

52:23.520 --> 52:29.440
that there is this half of our president or 25% that was like, like, like we kind of marvel

52:29.440 --> 52:39.240
at his absolute fucking like, like, uh, dead, nerfed, like, just like, like the idea of

52:39.240 --> 52:44.720
it's, it's funny and almost cool from a writer's perspective, a character that if you said,

52:44.720 --> 52:50.240
can you pass the salt, they would say, yes, I will do the best job of passing salt that

52:50.240 --> 52:52.800
of anyone that's ever passed you salt.

52:52.800 --> 52:53.800
Did it ask around?

52:53.800 --> 52:55.280
I passed the salt the best.

52:55.280 --> 52:56.800
You see me as a character, don't you?

52:56.800 --> 52:57.800
You are a character.

52:57.800 --> 52:58.800
Are you kidding me?

52:58.800 --> 53:01.520
I'm not, I'm not talking about you, you narcissist.

53:01.520 --> 53:02.520
I understand.

53:02.520 --> 53:03.520
I understand.

53:03.520 --> 53:05.880
I'm just trying to laser into what you're saying.

53:05.880 --> 53:09.440
With him, that's like, when we, when we talk about that aspect of him, if you could just

53:09.440 --> 53:14.360
isolate it, if you could just like suck that little bit of juice, like, like, we're envious

53:14.360 --> 53:16.560
of that because it's called like, it's like thinking positively.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.680
Wait, wait, this is like a writer's meeting you had with Mike McVan?

53:18.680 --> 53:21.920
You were like, we can't figure out, oh, but what's the deal with it?

53:21.920 --> 53:22.920
No, no, no, no.

53:22.920 --> 53:23.920
As a function.

53:23.920 --> 53:24.920
No.

53:24.920 --> 53:25.920
I was just, it was a related thing.

53:25.920 --> 53:26.920
Oh, I see.

53:26.920 --> 53:30.280
Maybe I am the narcissist, you're right.

53:30.280 --> 53:31.560
I am pretty narcissist.

53:31.560 --> 53:32.560
Thank you.

53:32.560 --> 53:33.560
You just brought it out.

53:33.560 --> 53:34.560
I'm just saying.

53:34.560 --> 53:35.560
You're doing what you gotta do.

53:35.560 --> 53:38.680
All of us have maybe blind spots, or I'm not going to try to universalize it.

53:38.680 --> 53:42.960
I'm saying like, you, you, you could talk to a guy who was like catatonic, I was like,

53:42.960 --> 53:44.160
we're making fun of you for it.

53:44.160 --> 53:45.160
I see.

53:45.160 --> 53:52.960
But like, there's also like, like, I'm trying to learn that from this like, this, this like,

53:52.960 --> 53:59.960
you know, troglodyte that we've, we've, we've, you know, chosen to, to celebrate our demise

53:59.960 --> 54:02.960
as a, as a culture, not you, as a president.

54:02.960 --> 54:03.960
I know.

54:03.960 --> 54:07.080
I'm trying to, I'm trying to like, I'm trying to like see the, see, I'm like, I'm like,

54:07.080 --> 54:11.600
we're, we're, we admire about him, like, and, and why is he so, and how come you watch

54:11.600 --> 54:14.520
like Huckabee, like get away with it or not get away with it?

54:14.520 --> 54:18.960
Like he's, you can see like Huckabee on Twitter, try to like, all right, I guess, I guess the

54:18.960 --> 54:23.640
market's primed for an old man to be kind of a, kind of a goose ball on Twitter and

54:23.640 --> 54:24.640
you're just like, Huckabee hour.

54:24.640 --> 54:25.640
Nah, you're the worst.

54:25.640 --> 54:28.640
I'm running in here.

54:28.640 --> 54:34.680
Whatever, Abbot, I, I, I, I'm with you, I'm trying to give you, yeah.

54:34.680 --> 54:38.720
Between my dance-planing, your Abbot-ness, like, and you being Abbot during it, it's

54:38.720 --> 54:42.200
like we're, the audience is like, we've, it's a black hole, we're going to die.

54:42.200 --> 54:46.520
No, but you guys, my wristwatch turned into legs, you guys are doing your own show that's

54:46.520 --> 54:47.520
going to be happening.

54:47.520 --> 54:48.520
We are.

54:48.520 --> 54:49.520
NBC.

54:49.520 --> 54:50.520
No.

54:50.520 --> 54:51.520
Here.

54:51.520 --> 54:52.520
On the, on the sixth, right?

54:52.520 --> 54:53.520
A couple of days.

54:53.520 --> 54:54.520
Yeah.

54:54.520 --> 54:55.520
Starburn's Castle.

54:55.520 --> 54:56.520
Yeah, this is what you'll see.

54:56.520 --> 54:57.520
It's our second ever show.

54:57.520 --> 55:01.880
Our first one went off really well, like a good turnout and our guest was Rich Fulcher

55:01.880 --> 55:06.120
last month and this month, it's Martin Olsen, who you might know from, uh, Adventure Time

55:06.120 --> 55:09.280
or, he brought the most part in life for all sorts of guys.

55:09.280 --> 55:10.280
Quite a guy, quite a guy.

55:10.280 --> 55:11.280
Yeah, yeah.

55:11.280 --> 55:15.360
We did a skit with him before where he was your dad and I'm asking for a date and then

55:15.360 --> 55:16.640
he beats the shit out of me.

55:16.640 --> 55:17.640
No, he strangles me.

55:17.640 --> 55:18.640
What does he do?

55:18.640 --> 55:19.640
I don't know.

55:19.640 --> 55:20.640
He's a good guy.

55:20.640 --> 55:23.800
You guys ever go to Disneyland and go to Mickey's house in Toontown?

55:23.800 --> 55:26.080
You wait and you meet Mickey Mouse?

55:26.080 --> 55:29.840
I just did that for the first time with my girlfriend and, uh, we, as you're waiting

55:29.840 --> 55:33.480
in line there, there's these awesome cartoons that are old, like vintage looking Mickey

55:33.480 --> 55:36.520
Mouse and Minnie Mouse things.

55:36.520 --> 55:37.520
And that's Callie.

55:37.520 --> 55:38.520
She made those things.

55:38.520 --> 55:41.760
Well, I, I designed the, I did a bunch of designs.

55:41.760 --> 55:42.840
There was a whole team of people.

55:42.840 --> 55:45.160
But the design is, the design is the whole point.

55:45.160 --> 55:47.720
It's like beautifully, beautifully designed.

55:47.720 --> 55:50.880
It's like some of the coolest animation I've, I've seen in a very long time.

55:50.880 --> 55:52.880
It's like, did you know it was her when you saw it?

55:52.880 --> 55:57.640
I remember seeing clips of like stuff that you've posted online and then I was watching

55:57.640 --> 56:00.720
it with church and I was like, oh, this is the, this is the thing that Callie worked

56:00.720 --> 56:01.720
on.

56:01.720 --> 56:02.720
Yeah.

56:02.720 --> 56:07.600
It's like, like old vintage black and white Disney meets like Ren and Stimpy meets like

56:07.600 --> 56:08.680
the triplets of Belleville.

56:08.680 --> 56:09.680
Like it's really cool.

56:09.680 --> 56:10.680
It's, it's so.

56:10.680 --> 56:11.680
Yeah.

56:11.680 --> 56:15.400
I mean, my team especially are like super, super amazing.

56:15.400 --> 56:16.400
Is that Andy?

56:16.400 --> 56:17.400
Andy Sirianna?

56:17.400 --> 56:18.400
Yeah, Andy Sirianna.

56:18.400 --> 56:19.400
He's doing Ninja Turtles now.

56:19.400 --> 56:20.400
Great guy.

56:20.400 --> 56:21.400
Great guy.

56:21.400 --> 56:22.400
He looks like Wolverine.

56:22.400 --> 56:28.080
Suppose I'm a young Burbank, uh, hipster.

56:28.080 --> 56:30.200
You just described me and Spencer.

56:30.200 --> 56:31.200
Yeah.

56:31.200 --> 56:33.680
I mean, I, I could, you could pass for that.

56:33.680 --> 56:35.280
The beard really does that.

56:35.280 --> 56:36.280
Selga.

56:36.280 --> 56:37.280
Continue your thought.

56:37.280 --> 56:40.720
What, what, what, what, why should I come to whatever your show's called, which you

56:40.720 --> 56:41.720
now tell us is.

56:41.720 --> 56:43.080
Well, it's because it's not filmed.

56:43.080 --> 56:48.440
So, so to go back to the egotistical thing, it's called What About Me, which is about

56:48.440 --> 56:50.440
us going, well, what about me?

56:50.440 --> 56:51.440
Yeah.

56:51.440 --> 56:54.000
So every time someone ends a sentence, we're like, well, what about me?

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
I'm important too.

56:55.000 --> 56:59.920
But like, the birth of the show was that I was frustrated with Hollywood and I wanted

56:59.920 --> 57:02.800
to write and get people to see my comedy.

57:02.800 --> 57:06.440
So I was like, I'll just do a show and you know, make it with my friend who does great

57:06.440 --> 57:07.440
music.

57:07.440 --> 57:08.440
Yeah.

57:08.440 --> 57:09.440
So it's like it's a true variety show.

57:09.440 --> 57:13.960
It's, it's, it's what was the most frustrating thing about Hollywood for you?

57:13.960 --> 57:18.600
Well, it, it, there's a lot of things, but mainly like I've pitched and I've.

57:18.600 --> 57:20.440
Oh, so you might know Abbot.

57:20.440 --> 57:22.440
So he, he wrote a little bit on Rick and Morty.

57:22.440 --> 57:24.080
He worked on the commercial episodes.

57:24.080 --> 57:25.080
Yeah.

57:25.080 --> 57:26.080
Oh, that's right.

57:26.080 --> 57:27.080
Yeah.

57:27.080 --> 57:28.080
Yeah.

57:28.080 --> 57:29.080
And I had a hundred ideas and they picked five.

57:29.080 --> 57:31.160
It was the, it was the lack of you that frustrated you about Hollywood.

57:31.160 --> 57:32.160
Oh yeah.

57:32.160 --> 57:33.160
Like, wait.

57:33.160 --> 57:34.160
No, no, not the lack of me.

57:34.160 --> 57:38.640
The fact that I think I'm as good as, as Johnny, two, two tones over there, who's, he's, he's

57:38.640 --> 57:42.760
like, you know, I watch his career just spirally out of control and I'm like, Johnny, I can

57:42.760 --> 57:43.760
do that.

57:43.760 --> 57:45.840
Is Johnny, is Johnny two tones here tonight?

57:45.840 --> 57:46.840
I don't know.

57:46.840 --> 57:48.040
He might be here.

57:48.040 --> 57:49.040
You fucker.

57:49.040 --> 57:50.040
My father.

57:50.040 --> 57:51.040
Fuck you.

57:51.040 --> 57:54.800
No, I mean, but look, I, I have, you know, I feel like I can do that.

57:54.800 --> 57:57.560
So I'm like, let me just do a show where I can do that.

57:57.560 --> 57:59.560
I know executive is saying.

57:59.560 --> 58:00.560
That being, that's crazy.

58:00.560 --> 58:01.560
Like a variable.

58:01.560 --> 58:05.280
I can't ask you because I'm not going to start a beef between you and Johnny Pemberton

58:05.280 --> 58:06.280
or whoever it is.

58:06.280 --> 58:07.280
You're, you're.

58:07.280 --> 58:08.280
No two tones.

58:08.280 --> 58:12.320
I'm saying like, we're not going to, I'm not going to ask you to tell me who it is that

58:12.320 --> 58:14.280
you do think you're, you could do.

58:14.280 --> 58:20.200
Yeah, please don't, but, but, but, but, no, I mean, the alternative for anybody who wanted

58:20.200 --> 58:24.360
to come to the show, but was still on the fence guy like, gosh, maybe I, you know, like

58:24.360 --> 58:25.360
I do some.

58:25.360 --> 58:27.920
Well, we have a lot of good special guests this month.

58:27.920 --> 58:32.680
We, besides Martin Wilson, we also have Mike McCafferty of one on one fame and Star Trek

58:32.680 --> 58:34.880
podcast on the Farrell audio network.

58:34.880 --> 58:36.360
His Star Trek podcast is great.

58:36.360 --> 58:37.640
I like the Rathakon one.

58:37.640 --> 58:42.640
We were just a guest on there and also we will be having Becky Garcia, who's an adult

58:42.640 --> 58:43.640
swim writer.

58:43.640 --> 58:44.640
She writes.

58:44.640 --> 58:45.640
Yeah.

58:45.640 --> 58:46.640
She wrote on hot streets.

58:46.640 --> 58:52.000
As of a couple of days ago, I was in the show, but then I screwed up and double booked

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
myself.

58:53.000 --> 58:59.720
Abed, you in the show, like because you can't, you could say Johnny two tones, I can do what

58:59.720 --> 59:00.720
he can do.

59:00.720 --> 59:01.720
Right.

59:01.720 --> 59:06.080
And we can't have you, we can't make you say, I mean Vince Vaughn, like I'm, so I'm

59:06.080 --> 59:11.360
asking you, what are you, what are you doing in the show that you're like, fucking come

59:11.360 --> 59:12.360
see me do my thing?

59:12.360 --> 59:13.360
Yeah.

59:13.360 --> 59:15.320
I'm, I'm like the Bob Odenkirk of the show.

59:15.320 --> 59:19.520
I just kind of write stuff and I act in stuff, but I don't give myself the main part because

59:19.520 --> 59:22.520
I like to be on the sides and I like other people.

59:22.520 --> 59:23.520
Abed's the crazy part.

59:23.520 --> 59:27.640
I want to extract their craziness in my own way and it's fun.

59:27.640 --> 59:32.760
You know, last month, we, Fulcher, there's a, there's a sort of script that Abed writes,

59:32.760 --> 59:35.920
but he kind of just went off the rails and did Fulcher really improvised.

59:35.920 --> 59:39.880
So much into it and he made it way better than I wrote.

59:39.880 --> 59:42.840
So that was a great experience because I like working with him.

59:42.840 --> 59:43.840
Yeah.

59:43.840 --> 59:46.240
It was like, we both had a talk show where we're the hosts at the same time.

59:46.240 --> 59:50.200
I saw Fulcher like in 1994, I think for the first time, it's a comedy festival and he

59:50.200 --> 59:52.040
came on stage as a show he did.

59:52.040 --> 59:56.000
I might have the date wrong, but it was called modern problems and science or something like

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
that.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.160
It was him and a couple of the guys and they would just get a theory that they would have

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.640
the, and they would get three different schools of scientific thought and they would

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.560
prove or just prove that theory.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:12.120
And his was Russian literature and he clearly, didn't know, he clearly had never read any

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:16.800
Russian literature, but committed to it so fucking hard that it was like, I watched it

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.240
and I go, that's the funniest improv I've ever seen.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.520
I met him because I was his stand-in on Crossballs, hosted by Chris Tallman.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.120
Because you guys are the similar kind of, well, I was his stand-in and he heard about

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:32.840
me being quite a, I just was talking the whole time and Matt Bessler told me to shut up and

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:36.640
it was like really crazy like experience and then everyone felt just like, oh, you're

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:39.040
the guy that was my stand-in.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.040
Everyone said you were weird.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:42.040
Oh yeah, you should play your, you have a podcast with him too.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.600
Yeah, I have a podcast with him on Feral Audio.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.600
Can you keep doing your rich culture impressions?

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.600
Oh no, well.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.600
Oh yeah, it's really, it's just because I see him so much.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:52.920
Oh, speaking of other superpowers, I don't know how this will translate to a podcast,

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:57.160
but remember at a party one time, you can do impressions of people, but not verbally,

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.040
you can just visual impressions.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.040
He can embody you.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.040
Yeah, I can embody you.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:08.040
Yeah, I can do visual impressions of like, do Dan Harmon, like give us some Dan Harmon.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.040
I got a lot of things to say about the president.

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:13.040
It's really crazy because you guys are going to like what I say.

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.040
Okay, here we go.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:20.040
The president, I mean, you know, he's thinking it's a little fucked up.

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.040
Right, yeah.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.040
Now do me, do you have Davis?

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:30.040
No, the thing about it is, so you do a character like Rich Fulcher and I just got to see it

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.040
for a second.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.040
Okay, one, one, one, one.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.040
Wait, yeah, now do it now.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.040
Okay, now do Ted Knight.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.040
Oh, Mary, oh, God.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.040
Oh, Mary, what are you doing?

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.040
Oh, I'm up tonight and no, Mary.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.040
He's just like saying that I'm not a good person.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.040
Can you do Callie?

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.040
Can you do a Callie?

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.040
Hey, what are you doing there?

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.040
Look out, we got a show to make.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.040
Get to work.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.040
So she's Minnie Mouse.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:05.400
She's easy to do because she's a character, you know, you have to be a character. It's easier to do

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:10.080
Yeah, if you really Google acting with Abed and you'll see young Jeff and a young Dan

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.580
Oh, that's old, that's real

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:15.180
They all turn on Abed because Abed's trying to teach you guys acting

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:18.000
You guys all, and Jess and Rowland and everyone

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.560
You come after me because of a real conversation we had

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.600
You're like, oh, I'm really intimidated by you

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:29.440
Yeah, and I told you that at Rob's house and then Rob goes, don't say that

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.160
Why are you saying that to him?

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.320
Do your Rob impression

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.080
Give him some Rob Schrab

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:33.580
Oh

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:37.920
Abed, what are you doing?

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.920
No, that's more like Ridley

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.640
No, he's like, you gotta talk about his shit

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:48.040
Abed, you and me and Kate are going to go to this restaurant

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.760
And we're gonna learn about Dr. Who

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.000
My favorite show

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.040
And you're gonna like it

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.040
God damn it

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:59.480
Yeah, you had an old one where he was like, my name is Rob Schrab and I love taking shits

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.120
No, I know, but that was, I was being, I was on, I was on camera, I was nervous

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.800
And Rob made me nervous because he was sitting there, like, just judging me with his eyes

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.160
Being like, you better be funny, you motherfucker

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.880
And so, yeah, that was awkward

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.760
Can you do Spencer?

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.160
Hey guys, you're, we gotta get move things along

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.960
We gotta get move things along, guys

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:24.520
Ooh, I can do, I can do, I can do Spencer, Spencer's like this

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.440
I couldn't tell who did what there, that was amazing

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.440
Hey, how's it going?

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.280
Well, you have to, she lives with me

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.280
It's true, I do live with Spencer

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.280
Or you live with me

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.280
You guys are roommates

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.280
Oh yeah, we're roommates

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.280
We're roommates

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.280
There's a show

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.160
Is Spencer a happy roommate?

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.160
He's like the best roommate I've probably ever had

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.160
I would imagine he'd be a pretty good roommate

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:47.680
Yeah, no, I hope my old roommates aren't listening, but really

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:52.280
My secret is I spend most of my life thinking I'm a terrible roommate

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.280
Seriously?

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.280
Yeah

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.280
I can see him being a good roommate

01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:00.280
Well, okay, like, you have the most adorable cat that I get to like vicariously love

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.280
Yeah

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.680
Because she's got little short, stumpy legs and she's super timid

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.200
And this cat has its own comedy show

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.200
She does

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.200
Right, here we go

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200
What about me?

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.200
What are that?

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.200
What are that?

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.200
What about Meow?

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.200
Yeah

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.200
Oh, shit

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:17.680
With a, it's me

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.800
Yeah, I might have a black eye and a broken nose, but I still do the puns

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:23.800
You're looking pretty good with a broken nose, by the way

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.800
Thank you

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.560
It's healed fast, because last time I saw you, it was worse

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.560
Yeah, it's looking better

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.560
It's pretty, yeah, you're a good healer

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:31.560
Yeah

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.560
Good job

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.560
You're a big healer, Jeff

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.560
He really knows how to heal this guy

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.560
I know you're way around a healer

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:40.560
Oh, I forgot, I did a doodle of your guys' new characters, but I didn't finish it

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.560
Oh

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:42.560
I should have finished it

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.560
I'll post it online

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.560
We'll put those up on the screen when we play

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.560
Oh, yeah, that'd be awesome

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.560
Yeah

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:53.200
What are the action items for, because we're really, you know, like, so, for people that

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:58.120
are in the area, okay, when's the show, what's it called, what are the tickets cost?

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:03.560
You can go to starburnscastle.com to buy tickets, it's this Thursday on July 6th, so after July

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.560
4th

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.560
It's called What About Me

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.560
What about me with Callie and Abed, maybe in Callie

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.560
There's also music

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.560
Well, Abed and Callie

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:13.560
I've got a wonderful musician, Chris Lin, who's a friend of mine from New York, and I'm actually

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:14.560
going to be doing a duet with him

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.560
So, yeah, it's also like a venue

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.560
What song are you guys doing?

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.560
I'm not going to tell you, it's a surprise

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.560
I see

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:25.960
But, like, I play music and I'm a singer-songwriter, so it's also a venue where not only I get

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.560
to participate in the comedy, and I let him kind of run off the rails, but I get to, you

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:30.560
know, do new songs

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.560
I'm very lucky that she does interfere with my comedy

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.560
When I eventually come on the show, can I sing a song with you?

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.560
Of course!

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.560
Are you kidding me?

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.560
Oh, man, you're a great singer

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.560
I would love to do, like, a country duet

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.560
I love Rainy Night

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.560
Oh!

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.560
It's a great song

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.560
Well, you're a big Eddie Rabbit fan, we know that about you

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.560
All right

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.560
I tried

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:47.560
I tried

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.560
Thank you

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:52.560
But, yeah, no, Starburnscastle.com, and just right here, where we are, I know

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.560
All right, well, let's hear for Callie and Abed, everybody

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.560
Thank you, everybody

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.560
Check out this show

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.560
Thank you

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:58.560
Thanks, guys

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.560
Go to Harmontown Castle

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:01.560
What about me?

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.560
Thank you, my love

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:06.560
Also, find her artwork online, it's absolutely fantastic

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.560
KaliKazoo.com

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:12.560
Yeah, it's, I have, she did a portrait of Roy Orbison for me

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.560
That's hanging in my bathroom

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.560
Yeah, her Instagram is awesome

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:19.560
She's always doing the cute little, like, Callie looking things

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.560
I'm not an artist, I don't know how to talk about it

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.560
Yeah

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:26.560
She draws like this really cute, like, kind of cutesy pie, Disney, like, pin-up girl kind of things

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.560
But it's always about, like, kind of sadness and loneliness

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.560
It's a good

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.560
A lot of vomiting, a lot of crying

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.560
It's very, it's very good

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.560
Oh, I feel

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.560
I wonder if we have time just for a couple of Twitter questions here

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.560
Oh, I hope we have time

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.560
Somebody asked a really interesting question

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.560
Someone, I can't, oh, yeah, he said

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:54.560
If you had a thousand dollars, how much would you regret your life decisions?

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.560
And I was like, oh, is that a joke?

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.560
I was like, oh, no, you mean if I was, yeah, fuck, oh my god

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:05.560
I was like, if I hadn't been as lucky in my life

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:12.560
Like, how much torture would I be inflicting on myself for every fucking thing that I've ever done

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.560
And it's like, it's fucked up that we do that to ourselves

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:21.560
Because I guarantee you, like, the fact that I have more than a thousand dollars isn't the result of smart choices

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.560
Nor should I be patting myself on the back for the choices I made

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.560
Like, it's kind of two different things

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:30.560
It's like, two different graphs, like, oh, money got made

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:33.560
But then also, mental illness was explored

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:41.560
And only because I don't have bad consequences to blame on who I am

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.560
Am I able to say, oh, those are two different things

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:48.560
So if you're broke and you're nuts, go easy on yourself

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.560
It's 9-Eleven

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:55.560
9-Eleven, shit, 9-Eleven

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.560
For people that have never seen the show, they were better before it

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.560
Well, that's, please don't think we're terrorists

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.560
That's just, that's the thing that we do

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.560
Yeah, Spencer, do you want to dole out some character sheets?

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.560
We'll be right back

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.560
Oh yeah, let's take a mid-roll break for a pre-recorded ad

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:12.560
During which the people that are in this space

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:18.560
And the people that paid $5 a month to watch get a secret dance segment

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.560
Damn, damn, do an armpit fart

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.560
Can you do it?

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:26.560
I've never been able to do armpit farts

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.560
I'll show, I can show everybody, can we?

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.560
Alright, and we're back

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.560
No, no, no, don't

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.560
I could show people

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.560
We're not back yet

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.560
I'll show people the, you know, that lady

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.560
The last segment didn't get cut out

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.560
And any plebeians listened to it

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.560
Even though it was like bonus and not for them

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.560
Well, they got some work to do it for our audio

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.560
They'll figure out how to do it

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:52.560
Right, by the time that we actually make these segments worthwhile

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.560
There

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.560
I put Levy, you know, there was that lady

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.560
She's like, I can't remember who she is

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.560
Oh, there, there she is

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.560
Remember her?

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.560
She was on Twitter a little while ago

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.560
Because she was like bragging about how we're spending less

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.560
Wait, what is this?

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.560
She's the ambassador to the U.N.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:07.560
The U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.560
So I was like, I don't know

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.560
I'm gonna put Levy's face on her

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.560
Just to give the old iPad a try

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:14.560
And then partway through it, I was like, hubba, hubba, you know?

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.560
Like, nothing against her

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.560
And we're enlightened now

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.560
We're not gonna judge women, especially in politics

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.560
For their looks, but I'm just saying

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.560
Like, you know, you throw Levy's face on like

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.560
I think we're finding out

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.560
We found out he's a winter

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.560
That's really his color

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.560
And I have a type

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.560
Alright

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:39.560
Okay, well, boy, we're back

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.560
And man, oh man, you should really pay $5 a month

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.560
Alright, you guys want to

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.560
You guys want to hear a little bit of

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:51.560
Pathfinder role-playing real fast?

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:55.560
Let's get Steve

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:58.560
Oh, oh, let's bring Steve Levy up here

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.560
Hey, there's people sitting on the floor

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:13.560
Did they pay less for their tickets?

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.560
I want to say hi real quick

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.560
To Heather and Andrew Gray

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.560
My ex-girlfriend's parents

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.560
Who are here from Scotland

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.560
UK

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:26.560
Are you still back there, Heather and Andrew?

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.560
Hello

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.560
I think we owe you an apology

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.560
Because we went to their house

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.560
When Dan was still with Erin

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:37.560
When Dan proposed to Erin McGathy

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.560
He had the ring in his pocket

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.560
While we were at their house

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.560
And we proceeded to drink all of their Scotch

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.560
All of their whiskey

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.560
So I hope we give them some back

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.560
But I think we drank most of it

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.560
I fucked up, I'm not signed into our Slack

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.560
Because I got a new 10.5 inch iPad

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.560
Like an Apple douche

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.560
But I don't have a car

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.560
And the world is ending

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.560
And I can do what I want

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:09.560
And I create jobs

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.560
Alright Spencer, do you want to kick this off

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.560
And give us a little recap?

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.560
Yeah, I guess

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:16.560
You seem very excited about it

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.560
I always am

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.560
Alright

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.560
Fuck, damn it

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.560
Son of a bitch

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.560
I feel like maybe, I don't know

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.560
Fuck

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.560
Should I not?

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.560
I'm just thinking that there's a trend

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.560
Where I read this while Dan's occupied

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.560
And I think we're playing into that trope

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.560
If I start right now

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.560
Thank you

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.560
That's nice of you to notice, alright

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.560
I'm in the DM's channel

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.560
Dan, do you want to put your little fidget spinner down

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.560
For a minute while we...

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:45.560
No, no, he's...

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:48.560
Oh yeah, I guess that is a solution

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.560
Well, what's new in Steve's world?

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.560
Yeah, let's catch up with Levy for a moment

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.560
You're wearing shorts

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.560
Levy, you look the fuck's going on

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.560
You look fantastic in a nice wintry pink

01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.560
Did you know that?

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.560
I do now, I guess

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.560
You look a little wiped out

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.560
Your jacket looks tucked into your shorts

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.560
Oh no, it's not

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:09.560
You okay, Steve?

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.560
Yeah, just...

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.560
A little tired?

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.560
A little tired

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.560
What happened, long day?

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.560
Yeah, long weekend

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.560
Holiday weekend

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.560
Yeah, it's just beginning

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.560
Yeah, yeah

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.560
Not for me, it doesn't feel that way

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.560
No, no

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.560
You got to go back to work tomorrow

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:27.560
Steve always works

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.560
Spencer actually, he covered for me all day Friday

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.560
And I love him for that, thank you

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.560
Great, Steve always works unless he doesn't

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.560
I have my character sheet up

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.560
And I'll just multitask between that and the Slack

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:43.560
To look at the PDF of the spell sheet

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.560
And I'll, you know, every once in a while

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.560
I'll pass this photo of Levy and get a boner

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.560
But I'll...

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.560
That's just going to have to be like a little handicap

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.560
But I...

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:00.560
A capability, a different ability

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:03.560
Which picture do you think you could more successfully

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.560
masturbate to, the original of that woman

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:09.560
Or the edited Steve Levy one?

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.560
No, for sure the Levy one, because...

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.560
Yeah, for sure

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:17.560
My heart, I'll be like...

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.560
It's like she was, you know, the only reason I have her photo

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.560
is because she was bragging about the savings

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.560
that we've made by not, you know,

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.560
caring enough as much about the UN

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:30.560
And Steve, which photo of Dan do you think

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.560
would be the easiest to masturbate to?

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.560
Probably that one with his balls, right?

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:41.560
It's so easy to embarrass Steve Levy

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.560
It's almost unfair

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:43.560
No, I know, it's great

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.560
That's why I brought him up

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.560
When you, yeah

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.560
That's like every group text

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.560
Like, no matter what anybody says

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.560
It's like a hair trigger

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.560
You're going to get the monkey with his...

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.560
The Cino evil monkey

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.560
You get shy monkeys

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.560
And if it's really embarrassing

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.560
There's also the thing that Cody and Dan

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:03.560
Occasionally me, there's a picture of Dan

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:04.560
with his balls out

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.560
It got worse, it got worse a couple weeks ago, Jeff

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.560
Yeah, yeah, we liked it

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.560
Cody and I like to trick Steve into looking at my genitals

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.560
And, uh...

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.560
Like, Cody will take pictures of me

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.560
in hotel rooms and stuff

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.560
And then I had, there was a hotel

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.560
And it had like a...

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.560
It had like a thing that was like...

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.560
I don't know why it would have this

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.560
But it was like a thing that was...

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.560
No, it was a thing you put on your door knob

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.560
Outside the hotel room

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.560
Because it means that you want it...

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.560
You want breakfast?

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.560
They'll take your order or something

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.560
Yeah, yeah, you fill that up in the morning

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.560
You fill it up before 6 a.m.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.560
You hang up your door

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.560
But it was like, well, guess what's going through there

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.560
And then like, so it's just, you know

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.560
It's just a circular hole that says breakfast

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.560
And then I'm like, and...

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.560
And so I just...

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.560
You could just text somebody

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.560
You could just send that photo to somebody

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.560
And you'd be tricking them into seeing it

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.560
But it's like funnier to be like,

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.560
Hey, Steve, I need those tax forms

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.560
Have you seen the thing?

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.560
We're in the middle of the desert

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:03.560
And some random bar doing work

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.560
And Cody is texting me in the street with Dan

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.560
And she's like, you know, we got to do this thing

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.560
And hey, can you help me with this?

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.560
I'm going to send you some stuff that I need help on

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:15.560
And then just this picture of Dan goes through

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.560
We're sitting at the bar in public

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:20.560
And it's three or four images in a row

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.560
If anyone was dick through the breakfast thing

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.560
That kind of backfired

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.560
There was a guy in the back bar on these giant screens

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.560
And it was just like, in the timeline

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:28.560
I'm like, ah-ha!

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.560
And there was a guy next to Dan

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.560
Who clearly saw this picture

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.560
This like conservative, misogynistic guy

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.560
Who, and we're laughing

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.560
And he commented on us, like, laughing

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.560
And I don't know, just...

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.560
And then Dan got sucked into this horrible conversation

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.560
I mean, didn't you guys, as Starburns,

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.560
Recently have a sexual harassment workshop?

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:49.560
Like, like...

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.560
Yeah, we did

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:53.560
Yeah, wait, wait, wait

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.560
Are you...

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.560
How does this not qualify as full?

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.560
It's totally fine

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.560
You obviously missed the meeting

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.560
Dan had co...

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.560
If it has to be unwelcome

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.560
In order for it to be bad

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.560
Exactly, it has to be unwelcome

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.560
Also, technically, Cody sent it to me

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:13.560
So, she's not...

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.560
She doesn't work with me

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.560
Dan had no involvement with that at all

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.560
He didn't want you to see a picture of his dick

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.560
Going through the breakfast line

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.560
I don't know, I think Dan texted Cody

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.560
Like, it would be funny if he sent that picture

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.560
I don't want to see that photo

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.560
I'm a little sad I wasn't on that group text

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.560
So I feel a little left out

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.560
By the way, it was a pre-emptive

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:35.560
Sexual harassment seminar

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.560
A lot of companies have them

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.560
We were overdue, probably

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.560
Don't say that either

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:43.560
I think it was right on time

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.560
No, because we're so good at it

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.560
A traditional educational thing

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.560
To equip all of our employees

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.560
With the knowledge they need

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:53.560
To make a safe environment

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.560
It took you guys 45 minutes

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.560
To make your next dick joke

01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.560
In front of everybody

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.560
Everybody that works at a company

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.560
That knows that those days are the days

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.560
That everyone is the grossest

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.560
Because everybody has this camaraderie

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.560
And then they're like, oh, we're going to do the sexual harassment

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.560
And then people start, you know

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.560
I'm above it

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.560
Because then I have a separate meeting

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.560
Where the lawyer comes in and goes

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.560
Okay, here's your meeting

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.560
Here's the number of ways

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.560
You can get sued for how much money

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.560
I'm like, oh, feminist

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.560
Like, like, like

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.560
I'm just like

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.560
I was woke

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.560
Before I started talking to these people

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.560
But now I'm like, wide awake

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.560
You're wide awake

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.560
I'm like, five hour energy

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.560
Who's feeling unsafe?

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:43.560
All right, Spencer, you ready to go?

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.560
Uh, yeah, Sean

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.560
Are you ready to rock her?

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:49.560
You should save that image to your photo stream

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.560
Yeah

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.560
Wait, what would that do?

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:55.560
You don't have to log into Slack that way

01:17:55.560 --> 01:18:05.560
Oh, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I needed to get into Slack for the spell loadouts

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.560
I had this in my photo roll

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.560
Got it

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.560
You look nice today

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.560
Wow

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.560
You should wear more sweaters

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.560
He's straight up harassing you now

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:23.560
This is the definition of harassment

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.560
All right, okay, well then

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.560
All right, all right, all right, all right

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.560
It's cut and dry, it's not as gray as you might think

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.560
It's also, like, technically one of the things

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.560
you learn in the seminars is that someone in this room

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.560
could make the case that, like, yeah

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:37.560
you could go to a lawyer and you could say

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.560
I watched a conversation between Dan and Steve

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.560
that made me feel unsafe

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.560
at a Harmontown show

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:45.560
and you could, Nick, you might

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.560
find the right lawyer

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.560
I wouldn't put that out there

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.560
All right, Spencer

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.560
Take it away, Spencer

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.560
All right

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:57.560
Last

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.560
Last time on Harmontown

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.560
D&D

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.560
You guys were in the town

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.560
and you had came to help

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.560
because they had asked for your aid

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.560
and you showed up and punched a kid

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.560
because he was possessed by multiple entities

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.560
Fake news

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.560
This is why he won

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.560
Then what happened

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.560
was you left and you went

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.560
and checked out some burnt-out buildings

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.560
finding some buried corpses

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.560
Then you went to the church

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.560
and talked to the church prior

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.560
He was all weird and you were like, whoa

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.560
He was sad

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.560
Tom's the bad guy

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.560
and you weren't buying it

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.560
but Jeff was buying it

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:41.560
and Diarrhea Jr. was there

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.560
The end

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.560
Yeah, we're like

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.560
we're our third chapter in

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.560
and because we did this the last time

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:51.560
in a tent in the summer

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.560
at a festival

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.560
we're already into the whole thing

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.560
like I'm like, oh yeah

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.560
what did we do? I remember we went to the friar

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.560
and but then like

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.560
okay so where are we

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.560
we went back

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.560
we got holy water from the friar

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.560
went back to Tom's house

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.560
and we tried to kick his door down

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.560
eight times but we couldn't do it

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.560
oh yeah, I forgot about that

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.560
you kept rolling apparently one's or two's

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.560
and we couldn't kick a door down

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.560
wait put the music back on

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.560
I can't

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.560
you want the music?

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.560
Jeff tried to burn the door down

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.560
and then they started throwing rocks

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.560
on the floor and everybody took damage

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.560
alright now it's gone

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.560
and that's currently where we are

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:37.560
we're on the outside of the house

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.560
I'm at the back door

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.560
Jeff tried to burn it down

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.560
and then Steve put the water

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.560
he put his water skin on it to put the fire out

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:47.560
and Dan tried to kick it down

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.560
kicked down a door

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:51.560
and then you guys tried to kick down the door

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.560
and they're throwing stuff at you

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.560
are we in a combat situation right now?

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.560
yeah, you're in a combat situation

01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.560
uh

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.560
you're in the back of the house

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.560
Carlos

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:05.560
I call out to Carlos

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.560
come back out to the front of the house

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.560
we're getting rocks thrown at us and I need your help

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.560
okay

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.560
I want to climb

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.560
climb to the window

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.560
yeah

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:19.560
alright, I gotta get my dice

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.560
yeah

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.560
I wish I had sex

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.560
you guys do stuff

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.560
it's like when

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.560
an 80's wrestler gets his snake

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.560
out of the bag

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.560
which 80's wrestler Dan?

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.560
alright, I'm sorry I didn't

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:43.560
the snake man, I don't know

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.560
I wasn't part of that culture

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:49.560
well how inventive

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.560
should we just say that I'm doing loadout 1

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.560
just to keep things simple

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:55.560
because I keep fucking up with my

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.560
yeah

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.560
we have been using loadout 1

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:01.560
and we still are

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.560
no, it's important to establish that

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:05.560
you climb up the house

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.560
you're on the second floor window

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.560
Steve

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.560
you did? you?

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.560
I climbed into the house because we couldn't open the door

01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:15.560
he's

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:17.560
being a man of action now finally

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.560
after putting up the fire I

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.560
set to try to burn the door down

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.560
I just want to know did he do that in the front

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.560
or where were you in relation to the house

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.560
the front door

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:29.560
sorry, it hasn't been my turn yet

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:31.560
well you came around

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.560
your turn happened first

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:35.560
you came around to the front door

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.560
then Steve climbed the wall

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.560
careful

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.560
I

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:43.560
say to Carlos

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:45.560
hey

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.560
this door is probably about to give in

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.560
kick this door down, you're stronger than I am

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.560
me? oh shit

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:55.560
you are Carlos

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:57.560
alright

01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.560
silver flame

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.560
guide my foot

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.560
it guides it directly into the door

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.560
you kick it and nothing happens

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.560
Jesus Christ

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.560
it's a really strong door

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.560
I don't know but I think this is the fourth attempt to kick down

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.560
this door

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.560
is it weakening at all? can we tell

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.560
that it's maybe giving in a little bit?

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.560
no, your attempts

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.560
have made it seem like

01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:25.560
this door is made out of iron or some shit

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.560
even though you can tell it's not

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.560
alright

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.560
I use

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.560
my shalely because I have

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.560
my quarter staff

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:39.560
plus one weapon damage

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.560
so I

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.560
just give it a full

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.560
oh no, I shoot a fire bolt

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.560
I use my weapon domain

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.560
and I shoot fire through my shalely at the door

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.560
you shoot a fire bolt?

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.560
what do I have? what shoots out of my

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:55.560
you can shoot all sorts of things

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.560
at all sorts of places

01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:59.560
I shoot a magical

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.560
actual flame at the door

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.560
you have multiple spells that shoot fire

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.560
fire bolt is a spell

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.560
fire is the thing you can do

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.560
that could be the answer

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:11.560
I just want to make sure

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:13.560
okay, fire bolt

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.560
you do that

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.560
you shoot it, it starts burning

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.560
it's burning and now Steve's on the second floor

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.560
so it's not going to put itself out with water

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:23.560
but

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.560
again, it will take a while

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.560
because fire is not

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.560
it takes a while to burn a door down

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.560
I step back after that

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.560
so I'm out of rock

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.560
the door is on fire

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:37.560
how about yours?

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.560
yeah

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.560
yeah

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:43.560
yeah

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.560
I'm having a great time

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.560
who's turn is it?

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.560
I should know

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:53.560
it's my turn

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.560
Tom Fell tries to stab at Steve

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.560
leave you with a knife

01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.560
oh, he misses

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:01.560
he lunges and drops the knife out the window

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.560
nice

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.560
oh

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.560
now it's a dance turn again

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:09.560
yay

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.560
is Diarrhea Jr. close enough

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.560
even though he's up there

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.560
I just want to do one of these things

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.560
be a good cleric

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.560
and do that buff thing

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:21.560
where I send an energy channel out

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:23.560
where it buffs everybody

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:25.560
which one? channel energy?

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.560
that's a heal spell

01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:29.560
or good aura?

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:31.560
no, is it good aura?

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.560
that just means you have an aura

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:35.560
that radiates goodness

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.560
damn it, I'm really fucking up

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:39.560
do it great, you're asking questions

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:41.560
and getting information

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:43.560
shit

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.560
I thought I had a thing where I could

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:47.560
I'm sorry

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.560
then I got drunk

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:51.560
I got all riled up because of that

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.560
I was thinking about how riled up you had gotten

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.560
it was Abed

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:57.560
he's so defensive about that fucking story

01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.560
he's the guy to sleep

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.560
I mean

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:03.560
he voted for Jill Stein

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.560
I bet he did

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.560
we don't know that

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.560
not only did he

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.560
not, but if you did it's fine

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:13.560
I don't care

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.560
I don't want a part of any

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.560
any incidents

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.560
shit

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.560
okay, alright, well you know what?

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:25.560
throw me the holy water

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:27.560
I'm gonna throw you

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.560
the holy water

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:31.560
I thought I had a thing that was like

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.560
oh well, alright

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.560
I thought I had a thing

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:37.560
what's your dexterity?

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:39.560
it's pretty high

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.560
yeah, I think it's like

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.560
it's 12

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.560
as clerics go, you know

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:47.560
we don't spend a lot of time at the gym

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.560
wait, sorry

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.560
what?

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:53.560
Steve has the holy water

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.560
I do

01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.560
yeah, it's in a bottle

01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.560
that's right, it's in my jar

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.560
because Dan would have dropped it

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.560
I have some too, you and I both have

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.560
holy water

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:07.560
but Dan used his

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.560
is it my turn?

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:11.560
no, it's still Dan's turn

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.560
alright

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.560
so I'm going to

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:17.560
because

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.560
the door is on fire

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.560
is there a window we could just go in

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:23.560
and not deal with this crazy ass door?

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.560
you could climb through the window

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:27.560
I climbed through

01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:29.560
I'm just going to kick the flaming door

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.560
ok

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:33.560
it's round 5

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.560
alright

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.560
you kick in the flaming door

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:39.560
kick it in? yeah

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.560
yeah

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.560
that's

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:45.560
that's the level we've been reduced to

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.560
they're cheering that we did one thing

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:49.560
right

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:51.560
an hour to kick this fucking door

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.560
you wouldn't be cheering if you were the family

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.560
that lived here, they haven't really

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.560
technically done anything to deserve this yet

01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:59.560
we don't know that

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.560
we don't know that, but that's when

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:03.560
you shouldn't kick in their door

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.560
alright

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:09.560
so you kick in the door and it flies off its hinges

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.560
it lands on the ground smoldering

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:13.560
and firing

01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:15.560
we're here to help

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.560
you not be a piece of shit

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.560
I see Tom, is Tom there?

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.560
no, he's upstairs

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:23.560
alright

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.560
Steve's turn

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.560
it's ok

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.560
I go into their kids bedroom

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:33.560
alright

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:35.560
well Tom's

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.560
just that as a

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:49.560
timecode here if you want to make a gif

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:51.560
well

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.560
Tom's in the window

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.560
you're kind of outside the house

01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.560
and he's on the inside of the house

01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.560
I didn't climb into the house

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:01.560
no, you're on the outside of the house

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:03.560
he's like threatening it

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.560
he was trying to stab you

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:07.560
you do a move where I like

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:09.560
jump through the window and

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:11.560
kick him

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.560
you jump through the window

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.560
and you try to kick him

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.560
but you just jump in the window

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.560
now you're inside

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:21.560
but you know

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.560
you're kick mist and he like

01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.560
whirls around

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.560
alright

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.560
Jeff's turn now

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.560
I run upstairs to that room

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.560
alright, you do that

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.560
where you are

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:37.560
where Steve is

01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.560
is kind of like the landing of the house

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:41.560
it's not a room, it's just kind of open

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:43.560
so you're both standing in that

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:45.560
and then there's two closed

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.560
bedroom doors

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:49.560
do I know which one Tom is in?

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:51.560
you know which one was the kids room

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:53.560
because you were there earlier

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.560
I open that door

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.560
alright, you do that

01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:59.560
is that the end of my turn?

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.560
well you see the kid

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.560
doesn't seem awake though

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.560
but Tom's not there

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:07.560
no, Tom is in the landing with Steve

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.560
can I keep looking or is that the end of my action?

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:11.560
what are you looking for?

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:13.560
Tom, he's with Steve

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:15.560
oh so I was just there

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:17.560
okay, I take out my holy water and throw it at him

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:19.560
alright

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:21.560
it hits him, wait does it hit him?

01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.560
it hits him right in the eye

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:29.560
you see

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.560
what is the holy water in?

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:33.560
like a wine skin

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.560
I squeeze it and squirt it at him

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:37.560
okay

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:39.560
I swear I had a 5 gallon

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:41.560
drum of it somewhere

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:43.560
you had holy water but you used it

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.560
and I think you marked it off in your sheet

01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:47.560
but you don't have the current sheet

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:49.560
sorry everybody

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:51.560
right because the spark was

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.560
the spark was guys told you holy water

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:55.560
it's not your fault, my joke didn't land

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.560
they would have laughed

01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:59.560
what?

01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:01.560
no

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:03.560
what? sorry

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.560
I like

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.560
right in the eye

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:09.560
he stumbles backwards

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.560
and lands on his back

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:13.560
he's like

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:15.560
water's in my eye

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.560
see, that's the thing about hitting him in the eye

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.560
with the holy water, you still don't know if they're

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:21.560
evil

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.560
because they're like there's water in my eye

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:25.560
I was so sure that he was evil

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.560
his flesh doesn't

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:29.560
steam

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:31.560
like a vampire's or whatever

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:33.560
and by the way

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.560
met a gaming table talk but the fucking guy

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:37.560
that we talked to, the friar had shit all over his face

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.560
I'm not saying that makes you a bad person

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.560
but he was like paranoid and crazy

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:43.560
I don't know if he had shit all over his face

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.560
also you did throw holy water at him

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:47.560
the friar?

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:49.560
see this is what I do

01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:51.560
I alienate

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.560
so

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:55.560
that was great, that was so much fun

01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.560
go back and listen to that

01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:59.560
oh, I will, okay

01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:01.560
the holy water has no effect

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.560
other than just being water in this guy's eyeballs

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.560
no, yeah, well it knocked him over

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:07.560
the holy water, the force of the holy water

01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.560
knocked him over, yeah hit him right in the eye

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:11.560
and he fell backwards

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:13.560
you of all people should know

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.560
a guy punched me in the neck cave

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.560
I didn't fall down, I just spilled my drinks

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:19.560
and blood all over my suit

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:21.560
I'm sorry

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:23.560
and we spent the episode

01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:25.560
talking about Abed

01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:27.560
yeah

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:29.560
you know, he talked to a guy while he was asleep

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:31.560
yeah

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:33.560
I

01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:35.560
it's probably the end of my churn

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:37.560
you can move, but yeah

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:39.560
I get on top of him and try to subdue him

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.560
I take some rope out and try to bind him

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:43.560
alright, well you go to do that

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:45.560
you can't quite start, but you get in his space

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.560
so you're kind of like threatening him

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:49.560
alright, he

01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:51.560
he just starts crying, he doesn't try and

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:53.560
fight or anything anymore, he just starts crying

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:55.560
okay

01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:59.560
who's the term? Dan, sorry

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.560
what's this

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:03.560
I only know this guy's name is Tom

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:05.560
because Tom fell, he fell from grace

01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:07.560
we think he's a baddie

01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:09.560
Tom fell

01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:11.560
of what's the town's name?

01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:13.560
Roan

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.560
Tom fell of Roan

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.560
you have many enemies

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:19.560
we might be your only friends

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.560
you must tell us the truth

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.560
he's just crying

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:27.560
he's like, whatever

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:29.560
just leave me alone

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:31.560
leave us alone

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:33.560
that never works

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.560
yeah, you look around

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:39.560
so I spent my churn

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:41.560
no, you can still do some talking

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:43.560
well, I'll

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:45.560
I just want to

01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:47.560
what if I

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:49.560
do you do some sort of clerical healing

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.560
or evil casting out kind of abilities

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:53.560
or no?

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:55.560
well, you know

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.560
look

01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:59.560
let me try, is he damaged

01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.560
to the point where like, can I like

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.560
don't I have like

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:05.560
like maybe I can get in this guy's

01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:07.560
good graces with like just to

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:09.560
make him understand that

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.560
we're civil servants

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:13.560
like if I were to go

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.560
if I were to just

01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:17.560
you know, where's the

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:19.560
okay

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:21.560
what is it

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.560
well, if I just use that channel thing

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:25.560
and I just go

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.560
can I just heal him?

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.560
yeah

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:31.560
he's not damaged

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:33.560
he feels healed though

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:35.560
I go, hey man

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.560
you alright?

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.560
what are you doing?

01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:41.560
look, there's something crazy going on in this town

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.560
like everybody's

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:45.560
yeah, there's a fucking nightmare church

01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:47.560
that's bursting into people's houses

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.560
and not healing sick people

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:51.560
is this not the first time this has happened to you?

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:53.560
no, this is the second time you have been here

01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:55.560
this evening

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.560
that feeling when your trail

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:03.560
of clues leads back to you

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:07.560
yeah, we're so bad at this

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.560
what's the

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:11.560
what's the kid doing?

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:13.560
the kid is in the room

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:15.560
he's in the bedroom

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:17.560
does he still seem evil?

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.560
who are you asking?

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.560
the

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:23.560
you?

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:25.560
well, he's not on the landing with us

01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:27.560
he's in the bedroom, he's asking you

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:29.560
Steve is in the landing

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.560
we tried holy water on the kid before

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:33.560
Dan missed but then it mopped his brow

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.560
with the thing and that didn't

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:37.560
it did some damage to him

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:39.560
I mean, we can damage the kid

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:41.560
all we want

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:43.560
we're great at that

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:47.560
diarrhea, go check on the kid

01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:49.560
I walk into the room where the kid is

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:51.560
alright, the kid seems asleep

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:53.560
oh

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:55.560
where's the wife?

01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.560
does he

01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:01.560
does he seem sick?

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:03.560
he seems asleep

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:05.560
yeah, he doesn't seem healthy

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.560
who's got eyes on the wife?

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:09.560
no one sees the wife

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:11.560
I need a 10 on the wife

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:13.560
so wait, Jeff hit the kid in the eye with holy water

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.560
and he's now asleep?

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.560
no, Jeff hit the tom in the eye with holy water

01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:19.560
oh, okay, well, I want to take

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.560
my glass jar of holy water

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:23.560
and pour it on the kid

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:25.560
alright

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.560
isn't he the one that's sort of possessed?

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.560
what? I can't hear you, I'm on the landing

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:33.560
he gets experience points for doing that

01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:35.560
who? Dan?

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:37.560
for knowing that he couldn't hear

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.560
you get experience points for being on the landing

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.560
wait, wait, wait, wait, Jeff

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.560
let's sidebar you

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:47.560
who's Jeff?

01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:49.560
Jeff gets experience points

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:53.560
Chad

01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:55.560
Steve gets experience points

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.560
what if

01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:59.560
look, I don't know how holy water works

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:01.560
I've never used it for anything

01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:03.560
like this before

01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:05.560
do you think we should

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:07.560
hold him down and chain him to the bed

01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:09.560
and then make him drink the holy water?

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.560
I think he's already built into the bed

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.560
he's already built into the bed

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:15.560
just get in there and do your thing

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.560
go nuts up there

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:19.560
follow your heart, Diarrhea Jr

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.560
no wrong answers

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:23.560
alright

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:25.560
are you calling out to me?

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.560
wait, you're not in the room?

01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.560
no, I'm in the landing

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:31.560
I go into the room

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:33.560
it's a small house

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.560
come in here and help me hold this kid's mouth open

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:37.560
I go to the kid

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:39.560
and I pry his jaw open

01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:41.560
in his head and hold his mouth open

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.560
I take out my glass jar

01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:45.560
I pop open the lid and I start pouring it

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:47.560
down his throat

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:49.560
alright, alright

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:51.560
that happens

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:57.560
we wait with wild expectation

01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:59.560
you should close his mouth

01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:01.560
and make him swallow

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:03.560
I close it and shake his head like a popper in Mexico

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:05.560
you do that

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:07.560
he starts frothing

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.560
you steam starts shooting out of his body

01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:11.560
steam

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:13.560
starts shooting out of his body

01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:15.560
and you feel a sharp

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:17.560
terrible pain in your

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:19.560
what do you call it?

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:21.560
ankles

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:23.560
you forgot ankles?

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:25.560
alright

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:27.560
ankles?

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:29.560
so we didn't have a 20 on the wife

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:31.560
a knife shoots out

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:33.560
and stabs you in the legs

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:35.560
for 3 damage

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.560
each of you take 3 damage

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:39.560
is she under the bed?

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:41.560
god damn it

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.560
when you do a raid, you always look for the wife

01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:47.560
they get a homestead instinct

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:49.560
riles them up

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:51.560
they'll take you out like Rambo

01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:53.560
how much damage did I take?

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.560
3

01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.560
Jesus Christ, I'm getting killed over here

01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:59.560
alright

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:01.560
the demon spawn child

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:03.560
starts thrashing

01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:05.560
and sizzling

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:07.560
and frothing madly

01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:09.560
and spasming all over the place

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:11.560
you see a black spirit

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.560
erupt from its mouth

01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:15.560
it's all weird

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:17.560
it looks like a flat dark colored

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:19.560
ghost silhouette

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.560
shadowy thing

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.560
it's wailing on the demon

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.560
it's like punching at the demon

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.560
and they're wrestling on the floor

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.560
these two immaterial creatures

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:31.560
is that the ghost of the brother

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.560
that we saw from earlier?

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.560
what was it?

01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:37.560
the ghost you saw in the past

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:39.560
so archer is for now fighting a demon ghost

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:41.560
that's emanating

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:43.560
they're both emanating from Cliff

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.560
they have emanated, now they're done being emanated

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:47.560
but yes

01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:49.560
they're out fighting physically out in the room

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:51.560
oh yeah, they're duking out

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:53.560
oh man, the production values are great

01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:57.560
I'm just cradling

01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.560
Tom on the landings

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:01.560
it's gonna be cool man, sometimes shit

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:03.560
you know, life doesn't

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.560
why don't you just come back in the morning

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:07.560
or something

01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.560
or not burst down the door

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.560
or not like the house on fire

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:13.560
do you guys put the house out?

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:15.560
I think there's a burning door downstairs

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:17.560
you smell smoke real bad

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:19.560
I'll take care of that

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:21.560
but before I do, I want to say this

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.560
no offense, but I don't get the impression

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.560
from where you live that you haven't made mistakes

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:27.560
in your life

01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:29.560
you're right

01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:31.560
every citizen should live a perfect life

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.560
in order to not be murdered by the state

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.560
that's not what I said

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:37.560
don't put words in my mouth

01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:41.560
I don't come to where you live

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:43.560
no I agree, I do

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.560
yes you do

01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:47.560
you do that twice a night apparently

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.560
you're not even

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:51.560
I'm agreeing with you

01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:53.560
where's your water?

01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:55.560
their water to put out the fire

01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:57.560
in your house I started

01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:59.560
it's in the well

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:01.560
it's in the well

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:03.560
we live on a farm

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:05.560
do you have any people that can go get some

01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:09.560
fuck

01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:11.560
do you have a bucket?

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:13.560
there's a bucket

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.560
I don't want you running around

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.560
there's a plan

01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:19.560
he grabs the bucket and runs outside

01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:21.560
I assume you're following him

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:23.560
he just does it normally

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.560
he throws the bucket of water

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.560
he puts out the fire

01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.560
teamwork

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.560
I hollered down

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:33.560
we got a ghost fight up here

01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:35.560
and a lady has cut my ankles

01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:37.560
from underneath the bed

01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.560
we got a code 14 up here

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.560
well you're doing it all

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:43.560
in a house that ain't on fire

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:51.560
and there's like a Voltron

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:53.560
split screen

01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:57.560
we're all working together synergy

01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:59.560
that's great

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:01.560
let's keep going though

01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:03.560
Tom, I'm going to hide upstairs

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:05.560
because I'm a cleric, sounds like shit's going down

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:07.560
with your haunted son

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:09.560
who's the best church

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:11.560
in the world

01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:13.560
alright, you know what

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:15.560
we'll sell you later

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.560
I head upstairs

01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:19.560
I fill him in and say

01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:21.560
by the way, we poured holy water down this kid's mouth

01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:23.560
the mom is angry, she's underneath the bed

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:25.560
she just sliced us and the ankles

01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:27.560
like a prison fight

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:29.560
are the spirits emanating?

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.560
they're already emanating

01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:33.560
this is post emanation

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:37.560
I don't want to point out the obvious

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:39.560
I don't want a ghost's plane

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.560
but there's a ghost

01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.560
there's a ghost fighting

01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:45.560
what we think is the spirit of the dead brother

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:47.560
archer and they're duking it out

01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:49.560
on the mortal plane right now

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:51.560
well, I think we should help

01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:55.560
the good ghost

01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:57.560
are you bleeding from your ankle?

01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:59.560
yeah, I took three damage, I eat a good berry

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:03.560
wait, do you?

01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.560
yeah, I eat some good berries

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:07.560
do I see Bonnie?

01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:09.560
no, you don't see anything under the bed

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:11.560
how much healing do I take from the good berries?

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.560
well, each good berry you eat

01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.560
gives you one health, so it's up to you

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.560
how many you want to eat?

01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:19.560
I eat three

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.560
then you gain three health

01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:23.560
okay, so I'm good to go

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.560
I mean

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:27.560
I got to get some new socks tomorrow

01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:29.560
but I'm uh

01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:31.560
I mean, as long as we're still talking

01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:33.560
who cut your ankles?

01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:35.560
this is a crazy lady under the bed

01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:37.560
there's a lady under the bed?

01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:39.560
yeah, the mom, she might be protecting her family

01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:41.560
but it's a weird instinct to have a knife

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.560
underneath a bed

01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.560
I don't really like her style

01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:47.560
yeah

01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:49.560
seriously, we need to keep an eye on her

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:51.560
we have to keep

01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:53.560
just don't get too close to the bed

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.560
Diarrhea, get the lady out from under the bed

01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:01.560
I look under the bed for the lady

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:03.560
alright

01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:05.560
we'll describe that action

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:07.560
don't look with your face

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.560
I'm like five feet away

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:13.560
and I look to see if she's under there

01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:15.560
yeah, she's under there, she's crouched up

01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:17.560
like a big green tarantula

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:19.560
alright, so

01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.560
I take my slingshot

01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:23.560
and I load it up

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:25.560
and I shoot her in the head

01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:27.560
shit

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:31.560
not hard

01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.560
just like, you know, like

01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:35.560
what's your attack bonus on the slingshot

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.560
do you see that?

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:39.560
plus four

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:41.560
alright, you hit her, you hit her in the face

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:43.560
alright

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:45.560
with what, like a rock?

01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:47.560
while she's in pain, I want to pull her out

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:49.560
from under the bed

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.560
alright, that happens

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.560
alright guys, I think

01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:55.560
I have it under control

01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:59.560
can we do like a perception

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:01.560
check on her or like a sense of motive

01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:03.560
like is she evil or is she being

01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:05.560
just being a good mom

01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:07.560
you know what

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:09.560
save your dice

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.560
she's a mother

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:13.560
home is being invaded

01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:15.560
she has a knife under the bed

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.560
she's just doing the best she can

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.560
with what she's got

01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:21.560
I don't care if she is evil

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:23.560
she's going to do the same thing

01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:25.560
as if she's good

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.560
she's either a great mom or Steven Seagal

01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.560
she seems normal

01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:37.560
oh shit, I'm so sorry

01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:39.560
I just want to help your child

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:41.560
I take it back

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.560
I take it back

01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.560
now, I want to go over to the kid

01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.560
I think

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.560
diplomacy has gone out the window a long time ago

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:51.560
wait, wait, just

01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:53.560
one zero hearts

01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:55.560
give me a second

01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:57.560
I take out my water skin, I try to

01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:59.560
give the kid some water

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:01.560
and some trail rations

01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:03.560
alright, well the kid's unconscious

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:05.560
I just lost the heart, I made my broken nose bleed

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:07.560
oh no, do you need anything?

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:09.560
oh no

01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:11.560
oh

01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:13.560
yeah

01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:15.560
do I get his turn?

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:17.560
wait, there's a freaking morning drawing on him

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:25.560
someone get that man a tissue

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:27.560
Hollywood

01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:29.560
Hollywood

01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:31.560
Hollywood

01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:35.560
how amazing would it have been

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:37.560
when you got in a fight with that guy at the mid cave concert

01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:39.560
if he had you

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:41.560
cornered

01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:43.560
and he had a couple guys

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:45.560
and then all of a sudden

01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:47.560
all of your friends from jail

01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:49.560
the Latino

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:51.560
Hollywood guys

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.560
you having a problem

01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:55.560
Hollywood?

01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.560
and then you look and it's just like nine dudes

01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:59.560
and they like swing like pirates into the fray

01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:01.560
yeah

01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:05.560
alright, continue

01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:07.560
um

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:13.560
I know this is like

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:15.560
same old Dan, he doesn't know how to play Pathfinder

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.560
but I could have sworn

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:19.560
I'm a cleric

01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:21.560
I'm level 2

01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:23.560
there's an evil beastie here in front of me

01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:25.560
in the form of this black silhouette ghost

01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:27.560
I got

01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:29.560
and I don't have any

01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:31.560
standard

01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:33.560
in AD&D

01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:35.560
in the 80s it was just

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:37.560
I'm a cleric I'll turn undead

01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.560
I don't have anything like that

01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:41.560
you'll get that next level I believe

01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:43.560
well I can't wait

01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:47.560
but for now I guess I just go like

01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:49.560
go white ghost

01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:51.560
you do that

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:53.560
the white ghost is going

01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:55.560
well I guess it's a white ghost

01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:57.560
the ghost

01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:59.560
it's a ghost of color

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:01.560
maybe it's the ghost of

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.560
of white Roan

01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.560
maybe the whole

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.560
the thing that happened here is we forgot

01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.560
Roan's rust belt

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:13.560
could be

01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:15.560
alright

01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:17.560
you root for the kid

01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:19.560
go Archer go, we believe in you

01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:21.560
come on

01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:23.560
you believe in Archer

01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:25.560
alright

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.560
someone else do something

01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:31.560
okay

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.560
are they in physical form

01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:35.560
or in ghostly kind of apparition form

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:37.560
oh

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.560
wait a minute it's hard to tell

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:41.560
by looking at it they just look

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.560
they look ghostly I mean

01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:45.560
channel smite

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:47.560
this is a feat

01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:49.560
which I hope does not fail me now

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:51.560
use channel

01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:53.560
energy to deal extra damage

01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:55.560
to undead on attack so basically

01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.560
like if I could just do a standard attack

01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:59.560
I'll do something

01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:01.560
attack the clearly the more evil

01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:03.560
of the two ghosts I know who Archer is

01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:05.560
I don't want to attack Archer

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:07.560
what do you attack with

01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:09.560
I'm of course going to use

01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:11.560
my morning star

01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:13.560
alright what's the attack bonus on that

01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:15.560
plus two

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.560
it hits

01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.560
and I'm using that channel

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:21.560
smite so I'm going like

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:23.560
in the name of her

01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:25.560
Archer

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.560
I can't find my dice

01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:37.560
dealing 10 damage

01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:41.560
your morning star

01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:43.560
phases through the incorporeal

01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:45.560
body of the demon spirit but you can

01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:47.560
see the white energy of the silver

01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:49.560
flame that emanates from your

01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:51.560
weapon disperse the form

01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:53.560
of the demon creature

01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:55.560
as it slices through its mistly

01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:57.560
body

01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:05.560
you get the sense that the ghost kid did

01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:07.560
most of the work

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.560
but you don't let that bother you

01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:11.560
because of the wins a win

01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:13.560
I think you did it

01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:15.560
he did do it

01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:17.560
and hey

01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:19.560
there's bullseye on that housewife

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:27.560
she cut my ankles I was scared

01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:29.560
she was the worst

01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:31.560
she's still under the bed

01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:33.560
she can hear us

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:35.560
he dragged her out with her with a rock

01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.560
we're the 18

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.560
results are results

01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:45.560
I don't want to be Machiavellian about it

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:47.560
I turn to Tom and I go

01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:49.560
come on that house

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.560
no longer on fire

01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:53.560
kid no longer haunted

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:55.560
I'm talking about a good church

01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:59.560
he passes out

01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:01.560
what's happening with Archer

01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:03.560
the ghost kid

01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:05.560
looks at you

01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:07.560
like in a

01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:09.560
regarding way

01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:11.560
it's like wow

01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.560
people huh

01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:15.560
Archer

01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:17.560
what's going on in this town

01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:19.560
Archer doesn't really talk

01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:21.560
but it kind of walks backwards

01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:23.560
and phases out of the wall

01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:25.560
and you can kind of see it outside the window

01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:27.560
oh

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:29.560
it wants to

01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:31.560
diarrhea follow the ghost

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:33.560
I follow Archer

01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:35.560
he's

01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:37.560
Archer's going to the

01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:39.560
towards the graveyard

01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:41.560
at the end of the city

01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:43.560
but would our heroes

01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:45.560
find a thing in the end of

01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:47.560
the D&D

01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:51.560
all right

01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:53.560
do you want a rapper?

01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.560
yeah

01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:57.560
we did it

01:51:57.560 --> 01:51:59.560
Zach

01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:01.560
you got a beat

01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:03.560
laid on a Zach

01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:11.560
you got a DJ with a masjist?

01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:13.560
all right

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.560
oh yeah

01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:19.560
yo

01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:21.560
higher

01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:23.560
and higher

01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:25.560
rap

01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:27.560
hip

01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:29.560
hop

01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:31.560
rap

01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:33.560
I'm getting

01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:35.560
higher

01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:37.560
and higher

01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:39.560
I went out to the sun

01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:41.560
sent to the moon

01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:43.560
I'm going to combine you both real soon

01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:45.560
because I'm an alchemist

01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:47.560
I combine things

01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:49.560
and make children sing

01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:51.560
so I took some gold

01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:53.560
and some silver

01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:55.560
put them in a bowl

01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:57.560
hmm

01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:59.560
and I waited

01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:01.560
but nothing happened

01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:03.560
I'm a bad alchemist

01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:07.560
got a lot to learn

01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:09.560
about alchemy

01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:11.560
can't just put

01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:13.560
two medals in a bowl

01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:15.560
they won't do anything

01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:17.560
if they did alchemy

01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:19.560
wouldn't be called alchemy

01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:21.560
it would be called what normally happens

01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:23.560
but this is how

01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:25.560
we learn

01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:27.560
so I went to burn

01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:29.560
some books

01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:33.560
about alchemy

01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:35.560
because I was still not

01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:37.560
thinking right

01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:39.560
about how it works and thought

01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:41.560
if I could make alchemy have less information

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:43.560
that relatively

01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:45.560
I would be more of an alchemist

01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:49.560
it was

01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:51.560
misguided thinking

01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:53.560
it was thinking thinking

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:55.560
it wasn't like Lincoln

01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:57.560
they freed

01:53:57.560 --> 01:53:59.560
the slaves

01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:01.560
and created

01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:03.560
graves that are haunted

01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:05.560
by white

01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:07.560
America

01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:09.560
today

01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:11.560
we struggle with integrity

01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:19.560
we played D&D

01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:21.560
and we did it pretty nicely

01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:23.560
I'm real proud of myself

01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:25.560
when you say self

01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:27.560
you're probably gonna rhyme it with shelf

01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:29.560
there's almost no other word

01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:31.560
that you're gonna come up with

01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:33.560
mouth, south

01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:35.560
yo I'm gonna take a tooth

01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:37.560
put it in a booth

01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:39.560
and it's gonna shoot

01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:41.560
Lincoln

01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:45.560
that's a homonym

01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:47.560
right

01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:49.560
yo I miss you

01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:51.560
homonym

01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:53.560
my name coming in again

01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:55.560
I sound like other things

01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:57.560
and when I ring a ling

01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:59.560
I suck my dingo ling

01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:01.560
I got

01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:03.560
a Roger Waters size dick

01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:05.560
I can suck

01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:07.560
on it

01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:09.560
just by bringing it

01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:11.560
to my lips

01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:17.560
can you do like a Roger Waters sample

01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:19.560
about his dick

01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:21.560
avoid like a mix of that

01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:27.560
the razor blade

01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:29.560
the cold cut

01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:31.560
of British

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:33.560
government issues

01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:35.560
you don't understand

01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:37.560
when you're 15

01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:39.560
but they sound cool

01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:41.560
I'm Roger Waters

01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:43.560
the government

01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:45.560
of England in the 70s

01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:47.560
is

01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:49.560
confusing to you

01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:51.560
but the general idea

01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:53.560
is disenfranchisement

01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:55.560
my name is

01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:57.560
John

01:55:57.560 --> 01:55:59.560
Johnson

01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:05.560
this rap

01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:07.560
has been hit and miss

01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:09.560
but it's like

01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:11.560
a river of piss

01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:13.560
maybe it's made of piss but it's still

01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:15.560
a river

01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:17.560
you could try to fish in it

01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:19.560
and if you catch
