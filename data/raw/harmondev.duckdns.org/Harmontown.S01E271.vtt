02:11.200 --> 02:15.680
I got a second win there where it felt you know like a political Santa started

02:15.680 --> 02:19.760
rapping a little bit better than then whatever that guy that was opening was

02:19.760 --> 02:24.080
this is our Christmas special it's gonna be a really really big special show I

02:24.080 --> 02:31.120
mean I just that I I threw out the notion leaving the stage yesterday like

02:31.120 --> 02:34.480
maybe it'll be nice if we really Christmas up the stage and look what

02:34.480 --> 02:40.960
Kris Boruff who gets credit everybody Sarah Hill like like like quarterback

02:40.960 --> 02:46.280
to this I believe yeah Chris was probably like a offensive lineman someone's

02:46.280 --> 02:51.080
moving or is that yeah also bake those delicious chocolate chip cookies two

02:51.080 --> 02:59.360
types vegan and gutsy come on with snacks like this set out I wouldn't be

02:59.360 --> 03:07.280
surprised if we had a few special guests drop by for a nibble what so it is an

03:07.280 --> 03:11.360
extra special show excellent yeah I mean I wouldn't get our hopes you know it's

03:11.360 --> 03:17.960
not like Gal Gadot is coming but it's you know it's it's special because we're

03:17.960 --> 03:23.000
in a good mood I think we're probably not doing a show next week right no right

03:23.000 --> 03:26.680
because it'll be like Christmas Eve is that math right so you should spend time

03:26.680 --> 03:33.680
with your family and or activist group or whatever your new family your your

03:33.680 --> 03:39.080
your people the people you pick even if you have to find them at random in some

03:39.080 --> 03:44.960
chat room find find a family I don't want I don't want to orphan shame you if

03:44.960 --> 03:48.440
family doesn't mean parents what's the orphan gonna do nothing or if I don't

03:48.440 --> 03:52.800
even have no back right don't even have no internet or if I don't even have no

03:52.800 --> 03:58.040
internet thank you yeah man well we shall be orphan soon net neutrality has

03:58.040 --> 04:02.440
been repealed which means you know I'll have some special rich persons internet

04:02.440 --> 04:08.560
where I only get Netflix and like poor people tracker to watch a monitor the

04:08.560 --> 04:13.400
outside of my house poor people will will also have like a poor version of

04:13.400 --> 04:17.600
Netflix where they can down they can stream like I don't know movies that

04:17.600 --> 04:22.360
don't have like two triumphant a message in them those will be put in a

04:22.360 --> 04:28.040
special fast lane for rich people and then poor people also have like face

04:28.040 --> 04:33.040
time like if they're at work and they want to check on their kids in the

04:33.040 --> 04:38.120
reeducation camps poor people will get all the movies that rich people get just

04:38.120 --> 04:41.680
no endings I really feel that net neutrality this net neutrality thing

04:41.680 --> 04:47.480
even though we don't know what it is a lot of us I understand it's like it's

04:47.480 --> 04:50.800
like when I was a kid when people would talk about Nicaragua like all you knew

04:50.800 --> 04:53.720
was that something bad was happening you didn't want to do the research it was

04:53.720 --> 04:58.360
hard net neutrality is like it may as well be the name of some crazy nation

04:58.360 --> 05:01.920
where we don't know what's going on but but but I mean I think you've probably

05:01.920 --> 05:06.480
figured it out by now God knows all the people that supported it I could see on

05:06.480 --> 05:13.240
Twitter like had this massive rush of a week where they having just now like

05:13.240 --> 05:16.520
started asking each other what it was yeah because all they knew is that they

05:16.520 --> 05:20.960
that in their opinion the bad guys liked it and now it's time to repeal it like

05:20.960 --> 05:24.640
someone got to these people and said it was like Obama trality or something yeah

05:24.640 --> 05:29.720
and so and so you could see them all looking it up and going huh and then

05:29.720 --> 05:34.360
like like like their big insults were like like I just like to see some of

05:34.360 --> 05:38.200
these people explain this shit that are complaining it's like a nice try no one's

05:38.200 --> 05:42.280
doing your homework for you fucking greasy fuckface it's also super easy to

05:42.280 --> 05:46.480
explain the people who brought us ATMs now want to charge us for ATMs yeah the

05:46.480 --> 05:51.720
same old argument the agency that we created because we once thought the

05:51.720 --> 05:56.320
radio waves might run out who and then stuck around because once you create a

05:56.320 --> 05:59.520
government agency you just don't get rid of it you never have a meeting ago we

05:59.520 --> 06:03.080
don't need no ATF anymore what are we doing we love alcohol to back on fire

06:03.080 --> 06:07.920
arms let's just get rid of them these agencies just hang around and if you're

06:07.920 --> 06:12.280
the FCC you just hang around and now yeah we so we started using them to at

06:12.280 --> 06:17.800
least enforce the concept of neutrality which much as Thomas Jefferson said

06:17.800 --> 06:20.440
about freedom of speech when I think he was one of the people that was like

06:20.440 --> 06:23.160
maybe we shouldn't put this in this document because then it becomes a

06:23.160 --> 06:28.400
legal matter and free speech is gonna only get less free if lawyers start

06:28.400 --> 06:32.520
arguing about it but anyways we put you know the FCC in charge so here's your

06:32.520 --> 06:37.160
job stand there and say there's net neutrality that's your new job you know

06:37.160 --> 06:40.920
you don't have to care if there's tits or F words anymore you can just stand

06:40.920 --> 06:47.600
there and say there needs to be net neutrality okay and so now we had them

06:47.600 --> 06:53.800
stop standing there and now they're happy because now you can now it's just

06:53.800 --> 06:58.040
the internet is no is now private property all of us are trespassing on it

06:58.040 --> 07:02.320
like we're all gonna be traveling at speeds that are able to be throttled by

07:02.320 --> 07:06.400
the monopolies that control your access to the internet probably my audience is

07:06.400 --> 07:12.400
not only aware of this but actually very annoyed with my ignorance of it we

07:12.400 --> 07:18.160
talked about it in the past and you also railed against the the marketing flaw

07:18.160 --> 07:22.720
of the name net neutrality and you brought up the ultimate suggestion that

07:22.720 --> 07:27.320
should have been and maybe would have swung everything suggestion that they

07:27.320 --> 07:33.840
should change the name to I think but fun it's a more positive name than that

07:33.840 --> 07:37.800
neutrality but fun might have worked but here's the thing I it's just such an

07:37.800 --> 07:43.040
assault it's at this point it's like it the it's not as if there wasn't a chance

07:43.040 --> 07:46.960
for the Democratic will of the people to be known it was absolutely known

07:46.960 --> 07:54.600
registered measured it was there we know that the country did not want this only

07:54.600 --> 07:59.960
some rubes who thought for a for a for a busy work week because they only read

07:59.960 --> 08:05.880
Nazi zines thought that maybe it had that they didn't want it they'll we a

08:05.880 --> 08:11.960
vast vast majority of everybody even the people who only could bother to care a

08:11.960 --> 08:16.520
little better like yeah that sounds like a dumb thing to lose and they didn't

08:16.520 --> 08:21.360
give a fuck they it's like we are definitely at this point and I think

08:21.360 --> 08:24.920
there's one step left which is this horrible Christmas rumor which is that

08:24.920 --> 08:30.400
what well there's just rumor that I retweeted this everyone's gearing up

08:30.400 --> 08:37.280
because for the for the Saturday Night Massacre part two which is the rumor

08:37.280 --> 08:43.680
that Trump is gonna fire Mueller over Christmas yeah no but yeah I hear you

08:43.680 --> 08:47.080
I've heard that rumor all right let's talk about black people in Alabama let's

08:47.080 --> 08:49.520
what do you think what are the odds on this and what are you what is your plan

08:49.520 --> 08:52.640
because you didn't have a handgun I don't have a fucking plan you have a gun I

08:52.640 --> 08:56.800
have one plan which is the move on dot whatever plan that I retweeted which is

08:56.800 --> 09:01.160
like you RSVP to a thing that says they can text you and with so that within

09:01.160 --> 09:05.700
24 hours of Miller getting fired we're all gonna you know just flood the

09:05.700 --> 09:14.920
streets that are you shaking your head it's a bad plan I suggest we all light a

09:14.920 --> 09:18.400
cigarette and take it up the butt one more time not to take it up the butt is

09:18.400 --> 09:23.400
a bad thing only if it's against your choice if he fires Miller you think we

09:23.400 --> 09:29.000
should get used to it what listen you're so cynical I'm not I'm not I'm just gonna

09:29.000 --> 09:33.760
be honest I'm gonna say we blew it a long time ago this is like if our father

09:33.760 --> 09:39.360
who left our mother comes back drunk on Easter are we gonna celebrate no we know

09:39.360 --> 09:44.080
where we are that motherfucking don't love us that's how it is we are in such

09:44.080 --> 09:48.040
trouble this is about rule of law that would be this it's about what you gonna

09:48.040 --> 09:52.120
do it's about slap his hand when he reaches out for the applesauce is he

09:52.120 --> 09:56.680
can't he cannot be passed there's it's like it's gonna be it's the last rule

09:56.680 --> 10:00.920
that he will have to break if he wants to know he has permission to break all

10:00.920 --> 10:05.920
rules forever I mean I know we've all had a lot of final lines drawn in our

10:05.920 --> 10:11.440
personal sands and things but I it is like I mean this is the second fucking

10:11.440 --> 10:16.160
guy that's an independent person that's trying to hold to just bring this

10:16.160 --> 10:23.320
investigation into the goddamn station any president should be absolutely

10:23.320 --> 10:30.360
willing to watch it play out and it's it's obscenely almost funny how little

10:30.360 --> 10:36.360
fault can be found with this particular guy and if he if he if this if this

10:36.360 --> 10:42.960
autocrat fires him over Christmas break that is him saying I would that's like a

10:42.960 --> 10:49.840
kid like taking his dick out and putting it in his mother's face at over

10:49.840 --> 10:53.360
Christmas like while companies over so what's the mom supposed to do like you

10:53.360 --> 10:57.240
that your advice is to say is like just why don't you just suck on it a little

10:57.240 --> 11:01.600
bit maybe you'll fall asleep no I'm saying your kid was first of all that's

11:01.600 --> 11:06.480
not what my mother did she sent me to my room second of all I'm saying your kid

11:06.480 --> 11:09.160
was bad before you brought him to the Christmas table and now you're gonna

11:09.160 --> 11:12.240
reprimand him in front of us and scar off fucking Christmas why are you so

11:12.240 --> 11:15.120
fatalistic now you're always the uplifting guy I'm still I'm still

11:15.120 --> 11:20.080
uplifted but I'm like this somebody been squeezing your titties this long and

11:20.080 --> 11:25.240
you really don't say something this is a this is a this is a this is a privileged

11:25.240 --> 11:29.800
thing right this is like a welcome to the party white boy thing I'm I'm just

11:29.800 --> 11:32.640
very honestly telling you that we don't have a leg that we're not on the gun

11:32.640 --> 11:36.240
side though what you would want is for the militia people to do something but

11:36.240 --> 11:40.000
they're not they're on his side so as liberals if they if they do something

11:40.000 --> 11:44.120
else to us there's really let's be honest we don't have the votes to impeach

11:44.120 --> 11:48.360
we're just not getting Congress back we can't really fuck with this dude yeah

11:48.360 --> 11:53.600
but don't you want to not on that level I mean it's I mean the the the like the

11:53.600 --> 11:57.160
women's March did accomplish something there what it didn't accomplish anything

11:57.160 --> 12:02.400
in writing it didn't accomplish any legislation it was a it with the the

12:02.400 --> 12:07.080
sheer numbers the fact that people's arms were rubbing up against glass and

12:07.080 --> 12:11.240
plaster and and and no one was fighting and the streets were clogged in every

12:11.240 --> 12:16.360
major city because he fucked with women and women's rights and then it was just

12:16.360 --> 12:20.920
like bomb and then since then it's been like let's try that again and everyone's

12:20.920 --> 12:24.960
like you know what I got I got work I gotta pick up my kids but you know this

12:24.960 --> 12:30.680
is this is the this is the other thing I mean like this is the thing where you

12:30.680 --> 12:34.680
want your numbers to count where you go where you want somebody to know I would

12:34.680 --> 12:39.320
almost say what RSVP system because I like the idea that the news item that

12:39.320 --> 12:45.480
that ends up back on Fox News where he can see it says you know by the way 90

12:45.480 --> 12:50.000
million Americans say that this is fucking it they can't handle it anymore

12:50.000 --> 12:53.200
and they're gonna actually walk out of their house not show up at their job and

12:53.200 --> 12:55.800
they're gonna go down to City Hall and stand there and piss at a bucket and

12:55.800 --> 13:00.680
tell something changes but I don't think that that that this is it all right

13:00.680 --> 13:04.960
because we don't have the we still have the numbers this is but this is the guy

13:04.960 --> 13:12.120
in charge of the investigation that absolutely it is I mean in some weird

13:12.120 --> 13:16.960
universe which if we're if we're if we're people that observe law and order

13:16.960 --> 13:21.840
we have to acknowledge like it's there's some weird universe where where they

13:21.840 --> 13:26.280
go you know what this is all clean it's all fine he's perfect we looked through

13:26.280 --> 13:31.640
his tax returns we looked through his connections financial information the

13:31.640 --> 13:34.960
four years leading up to this whole thing and you know what there's no

13:34.960 --> 13:38.880
hanky-panky going on this is just fine then and then we all it's either that's

13:38.880 --> 13:44.160
going to happen or there's gonna be a fucking thing and and if and if so if

13:44.160 --> 13:48.960
this investigation doesn't reach its conclusion we're what are we doing then

13:48.960 --> 13:53.400
what are you so excited to get on with then we're just defeated and hanging out

13:53.400 --> 13:58.960
and just like yeah I think they stole it from us they got it right now well we

13:58.960 --> 14:03.920
have our streets we have each other we have ACLU we have Planned Parenthood we

14:03.920 --> 14:07.680
have these grassroots things the political thing I don't think we have I

14:07.680 --> 14:11.560
honestly don't know how we're gonna come back from him firing Mueller because I

14:11.560 --> 14:15.960
don't know what we can do that's not that's not what we do it's just got to be

14:15.960 --> 14:20.280
like a we just got to be there has to be enough of us and we got to go like this

14:20.280 --> 14:24.560
right that's the problem with I like I love being a you know liberal but it's

14:24.560 --> 14:28.640
like when war starts we kind of are not the first people to take up arms and

14:28.640 --> 14:33.960
it's kind of hard to get motivated to fight them on that level I can fight

14:33.960 --> 14:37.320
them on the we need to have some food drives I can fight them on the raised

14:37.320 --> 14:41.440
funds for a family that gets burned out in the California fires but when they

14:41.440 --> 14:47.080
start doing crazy upper-level government stuff that's not that's not where we me

14:47.080 --> 14:50.720
personally I can't really fuck with them on that level I'm like you guys just got

14:50.720 --> 14:55.960
away with a heist and I honestly can't even correct that heist you know I'm

14:55.960 --> 14:59.680
saying yeah yeah it'd be like honestly if they were like we're raising interest

14:59.680 --> 15:04.400
rates well I'm going I RSVP they got my number and here's the thing that I want

15:04.400 --> 15:08.080
to say about these marches because you asked what did the women's march do and

15:08.080 --> 15:12.040
I think that these shows a force whatever we show up in large numbers it

15:12.040 --> 15:15.120
lets people know next time they'll be more of us and they'll be more of us

15:15.120 --> 15:18.280
will be more of us and we also get to look at each other and say I'm with you

15:18.280 --> 15:23.360
I got your back I'm with you so it works all right but when those marches wind up

15:23.360 --> 15:27.360
in the places where people are disenfranchised then I'll know that

15:27.360 --> 15:31.600
we're not playing around like when you do a women's march that actually winds up

15:31.600 --> 15:36.920
going to the women's center in downtown LA and maybe helping out those bodies

15:36.920 --> 15:40.280
those thousands of people show up week after week to keep those infrastructure

15:40.280 --> 15:44.400
up then I'll be like okay we we are doing some shit we're in trouble and we're

15:44.400 --> 15:48.320
reacting interesting in a positive way when that when they take the march all

15:48.320 --> 15:52.200
the way to Compton instead of stopping it in the richest part of the city which

15:52.200 --> 15:56.360
is downtown LA when they march all the way to Compton and they spend money in

15:56.360 --> 16:00.080
those stores but they they look around and they clean up those buildings they

16:00.080 --> 16:03.720
pick up some trash then I'll be like okay what's in there what do they got what

16:03.720 --> 16:07.160
do they got in the store they got good shit in those stores like a candy store

16:07.160 --> 16:11.400
yeah a candy house is there a vape is there a vape place there's all sorts of

16:11.400 --> 16:15.600
second-hand shit there's shops down there but there's the point is like we're

16:15.600 --> 16:20.480
still talking shit so on this one we we can't really draw a line in the sand

16:20.480 --> 16:25.560
because we don't that's not how we even operate all right fine brandy now that

16:25.560 --> 16:29.520
doesn't that doesn't mean we shouldn't be outraged it's just really what do you

16:29.520 --> 16:33.120
what are we supposed to do all fly to Washington DC when this happens and we

16:33.120 --> 16:37.720
should all yeah let's do that yeah how do we all have money we don't all have

16:37.720 --> 16:43.200
that money no but everyone who does can and hopefully that's you know enough

16:43.200 --> 16:47.040
people to break the walls down what are we gonna do when we get there we gonna

16:47.040 --> 16:51.160
we're gonna raise money for poor people no we're gonna throw ourselves violently

16:51.160 --> 16:55.600
at the walls of the White House until our bodies have to be removed from the

16:55.600 --> 17:02.040
capital can we instead of maybe going to them take ourselves away from the

17:02.040 --> 17:07.320
internet we can we maybe tell these motherfuckers what we expect it to be so

17:07.320 --> 17:11.960
they give us shit like hybrid cars like solar panels can we teach industry how

17:11.960 --> 17:17.320
to listen to us when we say we don't want to throttle why are we even using our

17:17.320 --> 17:20.040
government to talk to these motherfuckers when quite honestly as a consumer can't

17:20.040 --> 17:24.080
we just tell them we don't want that shit well they're monopoly they have

17:24.080 --> 17:28.920
more awarded monopolies but what then why don't we take a couple months off and

17:28.920 --> 17:32.880
hit their bottom line all right wall because that's that's way faster than

17:32.880 --> 17:38.960
Congress and that's what they respond to they stop making clear Pepsi I think

17:38.960 --> 17:45.080
they I think I think they waited they they clear Pepsi didn't successfully wait

17:45.080 --> 17:50.720
30 years so that everyone that needed to send out their resume get get get memos

17:50.720 --> 17:55.200
from their boss coordinate with their babysitter get in touch with their

17:55.200 --> 17:58.760
family let everyone know what they're doing had to use clear Pepsi you know

17:58.760 --> 18:02.440
like they waited till the right time like they're I don't know if I would go

18:02.440 --> 18:10.520
we shut blockbuster down what that's cuz DVDs came out what do you mean DVDs came

18:10.520 --> 18:13.960
out because blockbuster was renting to us and we were all surrounded we were

18:13.960 --> 18:17.240
going to blockbuster like it was a thing the whole family right and then

18:17.240 --> 18:20.600
blockbuster was like we could just hit you for fees we don't even care if you

18:20.600 --> 18:23.800
keep the movie rent the movie whatever we're gonna hit you for fees and then

18:23.800 --> 18:28.280
states came out and said no fees are the are the duty of the state that's the

18:28.280 --> 18:32.280
only thing that's only recourse we have a private entity can't collect fees or

18:32.280 --> 18:36.680
then we're all fucked well that was before my time I think it was right so

18:36.680 --> 18:41.440
when you were like eight yeah so that that sort of facilitated industry to

18:41.440 --> 18:44.560
respond in a way where you got Netflix where that motherfucker came along was

18:44.560 --> 18:48.920
like hey you ain't got to pay fees you can keep the DVD we don't even care we

18:48.920 --> 18:52.680
want a subscription service so I'm like we have taught corporations and

18:52.680 --> 18:57.360
industries how we want to be treated and if they need to learn it again on this

18:57.360 --> 19:02.640
net neutrality thing that's just the deal that's the deal when they put shitty

19:02.640 --> 19:06.400
TV on we stop watching and we went over to the internet and if they fuck the

19:06.400 --> 19:09.680
internet up well I don't know maybe we'll go back to hanging out with each

19:09.680 --> 19:14.280
other and reading books or shit but overall they they will learn from us how

19:14.280 --> 19:20.120
we're about to get treated all right so false alarm I came up so everything's

19:20.120 --> 19:24.200
gonna be fine because when when we finally get mistreated enough we're

19:24.200 --> 19:26.960
gonna show them what's up by going to the women's center yeah I don't think

19:26.960 --> 19:31.120
anything bad will happens when it comes out officially that it turns out you

19:31.120 --> 19:35.280
can rig an election without consequence I think going forward it'll all be fine

19:35.280 --> 19:39.120
yeah I just want to know if anybody wants to deal on some of this delicious

19:39.120 --> 19:45.440
lead pain I got it goes great with this best I mean they fucking took huge

19:45.440 --> 19:51.000
sodas out of New York that's a possibility we can do a lot of damage

19:51.000 --> 19:55.560
that winds up being good for ourselves you know well yeah I mean we're in

19:55.560 --> 19:59.840
California we're gonna be fine no matter what that's the thing it's not about

19:59.840 --> 20:03.720
like our specific comfort I don't think hopefully I mean even without net

20:03.720 --> 20:09.840
neutrality like I can afford to pay for a fast lane you know but it's not that's

20:09.840 --> 20:15.560
not what's at stake for the bigger picture right no but California is

20:15.560 --> 20:19.600
already art we've already started to sue like immediately and I think there's ten

20:19.600 --> 20:23.440
other states it's 11 total yeah 11 states have already pushed back and said

20:23.440 --> 20:26.520
you're not gonna be able to do this so while it is terrifying and it's not

20:26.520 --> 20:33.400
fair we do we we stand a good chance of getting our way in this deal if we fight

20:33.400 --> 20:37.400
as citizens if we keep trying to legislate our way out of these battles

20:37.400 --> 20:41.520
it's gonna get rough and well you know showing up to a thing where you sit

20:41.520 --> 20:44.720
cross-legged in the street until they mace you and drag you away and use your

20:44.720 --> 20:49.720
body to come up the works of you that that's not legislation that's I'm

20:49.720 --> 20:54.520
talking about these moments where and I understand what you're saying that I

20:54.520 --> 20:59.160
mean you're basically saying like yeah all the people that have lines in the

20:59.160 --> 21:05.120
sand that have to do with win an ideology has been transgressed they don't

21:05.120 --> 21:08.560
give a fuck about the people that live 20 yards from them and they don't give a

21:08.560 --> 21:11.920
fuck about what's going on in in their real life and they could they could be

21:11.920 --> 21:16.440
like Jim Carrey and yes man and start changing their lives completely and

21:16.440 --> 21:22.400
disrupting everything the in their comfort zone and I eat I all of that is

21:22.400 --> 21:27.560
true but there's it's also really easy to get like 50 million people to just like

21:27.560 --> 21:30.760
open their windows and say I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore

21:30.760 --> 21:37.040
and sometimes that needs to happen as well certainly but let's fight an

21:37.040 --> 21:41.880
economic battle with economics I think that definitely we need to avail

21:41.880 --> 21:47.240
ourselves more of like boycotting based tactics than we have been that's very

21:47.240 --> 21:52.920
powerful that's where the that's where the battleground has sure we now have

21:52.920 --> 21:57.320
no fucking legal recourse we net neutrality is now going to be a

21:57.320 --> 22:01.560
financial game it's gonna be about boycotts and all this shit but it

22:01.560 --> 22:06.960
Trump firing Mueller is like it's it's it's fucking it's a real it's a home

22:06.960 --> 22:12.720
invasion of everyone's home from wood by one guy who's saying I don't want

22:12.720 --> 22:18.240
checks and balances I don't want three branches I don't want any any any of the

22:18.240 --> 22:24.680
Constitution to apply to me I want to be an autocrat say nothing if that's fine

22:24.680 --> 22:28.880
and and by the way just drink your eggnog because I'm gonna do it on the

22:28.880 --> 22:34.520
fucking 22nd of December while everyone's gone like if he does that and

22:34.520 --> 22:38.600
everyone just hangs out I'm not gonna take that as a sign that we're gonna

22:38.600 --> 22:42.320
help the local YMCA or anything like I don't think I'm gonna take that as a

22:42.320 --> 22:47.960
sign that we've given up and so is him and whatever the fuck he's

22:47.960 --> 22:52.680
representing whatever evil cloud is in his is guiding him with the power of

22:52.680 --> 22:59.880
Mordor like like we we we have to it's the one thing we've been waiting for us

22:59.880 --> 23:03.040
just like would you just would you just submit to due process will you let us

23:03.040 --> 23:09.480
frisk you you won't let you won't fucking like submit like just say I'm a

23:09.480 --> 23:15.520
crooked person I'm a criminal I like I have my fingers and dirty pies and then

23:15.520 --> 23:20.040
say but I'm a businessman or whatever and defend it he's been lying and fucking

23:20.040 --> 23:26.440
putting it off for so long and try and and like I just I like all right all

23:26.440 --> 23:30.080
right well whatever we set our piece we're talking to circles yeah I'm still

23:30.080 --> 23:34.360
on the uplift I just I've recognized which battle and maybe how we should fight

23:34.360 --> 23:42.600
it I recognize which battle I and I alone and all of you yeah I RSVP to that

23:42.600 --> 23:46.040
stupid thing and I'm showing up they text me they go he just fired Miller I'm

23:46.040 --> 23:49.520
gonna go like I'm not gonna I'm not going down there with a with a bat or

23:49.520 --> 23:52.600
anything I'm gonna go I'm just gonna go down there and eat some spaghetti that

23:52.600 --> 23:57.200
I bring in a thermos and and then I don't know what I don't know what to do

23:57.200 --> 24:01.440
nothing and then maybe I'm just like I'll just lay down and eat grass until I die

24:01.440 --> 24:08.360
I don't know like I just I don't want to make plans for after that day he can't

24:08.360 --> 24:15.920
do this I know I know but we got this we still got this we got this we got this

24:15.920 --> 24:21.640
we got this let's lighten things up a little with a visit from socialist Santa

24:21.640 --> 24:36.440
Claus socialist Santa's here Santa hello I gave my hat to someone with a

24:36.440 --> 24:40.600
colder head oh Santa so when I needed it more

24:40.600 --> 24:45.400
simple cool can can I talk about Robert Miller for a second yeah of course can I

24:45.400 --> 24:54.800
are you gonna take my side a little bit it doesn't sound like so I think there's

24:54.800 --> 25:02.440
another side right I think a third side I think there's only two sides I think

25:02.440 --> 25:08.360
there's a side that it doesn't matter that the investigation trying to pin

25:08.360 --> 25:14.120
Trump on a technicality right is what the Democrats want to do more than

25:14.120 --> 25:19.520
anything because then you look at it and you go aha I got him and now he has to

25:19.520 --> 25:25.160
resign because I got him and what Trump does is he goes no you didn't get me and

25:25.160 --> 25:30.560
and legally speaking right like no you didn't get me does not hold up in court

25:30.560 --> 25:36.320
but when the only recourse is like being impeached by the Republicans that

25:36.320 --> 25:43.240
control Congress no you didn't get me kind of wins right so we're never gonna

25:43.240 --> 25:49.440
get him on a technicality if he refuses to acknowledge the technicality is it a

25:49.440 --> 25:53.720
technicality to say hey Russia do you want to have a conference about rigging

25:53.720 --> 25:57.920
this election and then Russia says here's some data you can use to rig this

25:57.920 --> 26:04.080
election yeah cuz like we do it all the time but that's okay so then those

26:04.080 --> 26:07.880
countries that we do that with with have every right to engage us in the court of

26:07.880 --> 26:13.840
law what that is is against the law and in theory that's not a technicality

26:13.840 --> 26:18.160
that's just the law being executed what what presidential candidate before this

26:18.160 --> 26:22.680
moment in history has ever been caught red-handed actually conspiring with the

26:22.680 --> 26:29.320
intelligence of during an election the intelligence from a foreign hostile

26:29.320 --> 26:33.920
foreign power in order to beat their domestic enemy in an election I mean

26:33.920 --> 26:38.080
there's the story of Kissinger and Nixon during the Vietnam War the two of them

26:38.080 --> 26:46.640
on Kissinger I believe was working for Johnson at the time and Nixon was a

26:46.640 --> 26:50.520
candidate and they looked like there was going to be peace in Vietnam they were

26:50.520 --> 26:55.440
gonna sign a peace accord where it would be like hey Vietnam that war is gonna be

26:55.440 --> 27:01.880
done and then Nixon and Kissinger kind of pulled a little fast one and caused a

27:01.880 --> 27:07.320
whoopsy in Vietnam that made the war keep going because Nixon knew that he'd

27:07.320 --> 27:13.280
win if his opponent didn't stop the war so the war was good for his campaign and

27:13.280 --> 27:17.720
it came out in papers later and you know cuz Nixon fucking taped everything it

27:17.720 --> 27:21.080
came out in papers later because Nixon fucking taped everything yeah that's the

27:21.080 --> 27:24.520
thing but he didn't get away with it or rather he got away with it he didn't get

27:24.520 --> 27:28.200
caught on this thing right because we didn't get caught because he turned

27:28.200 --> 27:33.440
himself in so when they came to Bush with dirt he went to the FBI I mean we're

27:33.440 --> 27:38.240
breaking elections against our own people with voter suppression and that

27:38.240 --> 27:41.920
kind of shit yes we are but yet you guys are going you guys are taking such a

27:41.920 --> 27:48.840
wide scope in order to refute a really really like specific thing here this

27:48.840 --> 27:54.840
guy is real under investigation for an actual crime to if we sit up here and

27:54.840 --> 28:00.120
read a book about from Noam Chomsky about how where America is the foremost

28:00.120 --> 28:04.320
enemy of democracy across the planet I have no argument with that but but that

28:04.320 --> 28:12.000
this is this is a this is a politician who is basically openly making a play

28:12.000 --> 28:17.520
to change the margins ever more of politics and what's allowed including

28:17.520 --> 28:22.520
the fact that when you are running for president in our country it's okay to

28:22.520 --> 28:27.400
engage in treasonous behavior as because the end justifies the means and

28:27.400 --> 28:31.520
once you're in the Oval Office then you can say I don't give a shit and it'll

28:31.520 --> 28:36.320
go around around and you guys your argument is basically it's America's

28:36.320 --> 28:42.360
poopy and and it's kind of happened before with our most horrible presidents

28:42.360 --> 28:47.160
during our most horrible times in history therefore let's you know I know we

28:47.160 --> 28:51.000
can care about this and hand out blankets lately I know I'm not doing

28:51.000 --> 28:56.160
either but yeah it's not that it's that I feel like once we fucked up we fucked

28:56.160 --> 29:01.320
up that that's the situation but that's that's all election systems the in or

29:01.320 --> 29:05.200
not all that's all of our election systems if you've comes out you Reagan

29:05.200 --> 29:10.560
election the result isn't that the the runner-up is then installed result is

29:10.560 --> 29:14.480
that someone gets a punitive action and then those courts or those districts or

29:14.480 --> 29:17.760
something changes structurally generally that's what you can hope and if he

29:17.760 --> 29:21.880
has to say no I didn't do that well we hold up an x-ray of him doing that and

29:21.880 --> 29:27.160
and it still doesn't get him thrown in jail or replaced with a with an Amazon

29:27.160 --> 29:31.160
drone for president I it's still important an important part of the

29:31.160 --> 29:36.960
process to go Mikey did you is this a photo of you taking a shit in the

29:36.960 --> 29:41.520
living room and let the little piece of shit say no it's not so everything goes

29:41.520 --> 29:48.560
on the bulletin boards I can't imagine like justifying not being invested in

29:48.560 --> 29:53.200
in these in these moments I I understand the argument that if you guys were to

29:53.200 --> 29:58.000
say this is a circus that's directing your attention and energy away from

29:58.000 --> 30:02.760
something I think that's true but I think it's it's a distraction that's real

30:02.760 --> 30:06.240
important distraction well let's let's talk about what the outcome would be right

30:06.240 --> 30:11.400
like a potential investigation and now this is I have an opinion that I don't

30:11.400 --> 30:15.840
think is going to be very popular but I feel like if there's going to be a

30:15.840 --> 30:21.640
Republican president it better fucking be Donald Trump because to me I look at

30:21.640 --> 30:28.640
Donald Trump and I see 90 to 95 percent of what any Republican would do 5 to 10

30:28.640 --> 30:34.640
percent of like rancid whipped cheese filling or whatever that he brings to the

30:34.640 --> 30:41.360
table but fundamentally he's such a gross ogre that all of the normal

30:41.360 --> 30:46.280
Republican things that he does people are like oh this sucks and he's yeah but

30:46.280 --> 30:49.920
the reason he's a gross ogre is because he's making an open play for a shift

30:49.920 --> 30:54.240
toward something called autocracy instead of where we've been mired in a

30:54.240 --> 30:59.160
sort of openly hypocritical illusory form of checks and balances I mean the

30:59.160 --> 31:04.200
guys that have occupied his position maybe they're autocrats in bureaucratic

31:04.200 --> 31:09.260
clothing but they're not actually just standing up in front of Boy Scout

31:09.260 --> 31:13.440
rallies and saying I wish there was less people in Congress so I could fuck

31:13.440 --> 31:19.000
more girls I like like he is a third-world leader who is who has risen

31:19.000 --> 31:23.400
through a fascist movement that has been passed you know has been provoked and

31:23.400 --> 31:27.840
made possible through like insidious means and I'm not one of these people

31:27.840 --> 31:32.640
that goes oh because if a Russian tweets a meme that says Pepe the Frog thinks

31:32.640 --> 31:36.080
Hillary's a kind that and then when you win the election that way that that

31:36.080 --> 31:38.800
means they hacked the election that means we're stupid and we deserve what

31:38.800 --> 31:43.560
we get but this guy knew about it and played ball with it and thought it was

31:43.560 --> 31:48.200
funny and thought that it was what he deserves because he's a sociopath and a

31:48.200 --> 31:53.360
90 IQ fucking horrible monster just like the presidents that people get in the

31:53.360 --> 31:56.640
countries where we so successfully suppress democracy that you end up with

31:56.640 --> 32:01.240
a fucking animal leading the people and it's hypocritical of me so the point

32:01.240 --> 32:08.080
where my voice is changing but but but I I don't want to live in a country though

32:08.080 --> 32:12.280
the kind of which we create all around the planet right well so here's the

32:12.280 --> 32:15.320
question right and I think it goes exactly to your point where you said

32:15.320 --> 32:21.240
that there was sort of the autocrat in bureaucrats clothing or the plain-faced

32:21.240 --> 32:26.020
autocrat and my question to you is which one is better seeing your enemy for

32:26.020 --> 32:30.240
who they really are or letting them hide and get away with it style-wise the

32:30.240 --> 32:33.680
one's better where you can see the wolf for the wolf but we're talking about a

32:33.680 --> 32:38.320
coup here we're talking about we're talking about people saying would it be

32:38.320 --> 32:43.040
okay America now that you're good and fat and scared and stupid and armed to

32:43.040 --> 32:48.640
the teeth and xenophobic and unemployed and fucking confused and have all have

32:48.640 --> 32:53.200
iPhones in your pockets would it be okay everyone now that most of you think

32:53.200 --> 32:57.920
that New Year's Eve is it means that America's 2000 years old and all these

32:57.920 --> 33:01.240
things that demoralize us when we find out how fucking stupid we all are would

33:01.240 --> 33:04.080
it be okay with you guys as long as everyone's everything's good and

33:04.080 --> 33:10.520
stupid and lazy and fearful and sad if we just shift towards the open-faced

33:10.520 --> 33:14.440
version of the closed-faced sandwich we were already eating is that okay with

33:14.440 --> 33:21.120
everybody and you're saying yes it is because it because it's like you knew

33:21.120 --> 33:26.560
the shit sandwich was already shit but that doesn't mean the guy saying is it

33:26.560 --> 33:31.560
cool if I just start calling it rape while I rape like saying yes doesn't

33:31.560 --> 33:36.520
mean you're protecting people it doesn't mean that your your value system is

33:36.520 --> 33:40.640
better it just means that you the cynicism is eaten away at you unless

33:40.640 --> 33:45.000
there's like an alternative plan which I know that you guys are I think you guys

33:45.000 --> 33:51.120
are street level think you know act locally kind of minds that are like you

33:51.120 --> 33:56.480
know you're more right than me I know you are but but I because we should

33:56.480 --> 34:00.680
basically if I took the you know the the the collective of what you two are

34:00.680 --> 34:05.280
saying I would you know it's like let's stop even glancing at People magazine

34:05.280 --> 34:09.760
when we check out the grocery store maybe let's try to grow our own food let's

34:09.760 --> 34:13.080
definitely not get on the internet tell people that want to get in touch with

34:13.080 --> 34:16.240
you that they can put a duct tape on your driveway and you'll come down there

34:16.240 --> 34:21.120
and leave a potted plant on a tortoise and I did that one time and you won't it's so

34:21.120 --> 34:27.840
hard to book you that sounds puny that sounds like I'm I drifted into that's

34:27.840 --> 34:32.120
not that's me riffing absurdly that's not me characterizing you guys as being

34:32.120 --> 34:37.600
ludites and backwards and ineffective tortoise lovers I was just me riffing

34:37.600 --> 34:40.760
about like like like like how do you unplug from the fucking system when

34:40.760 --> 34:45.280
it's so pervasive but like that the solution would be unplugged from the

34:45.280 --> 34:49.320
system and truly look at the world around you and start acting and then and

34:49.320 --> 34:54.040
and let the example that you live with your life start inspiring people to do

34:54.040 --> 34:58.680
the same and there will probably fire will catch you know if it's if it's fire

34:58.680 --> 35:02.680
guaranteed if it's not fire worth catching fuck it then you lived your life

35:02.680 --> 35:06.720
happy and effectively until doomsday happened and if it but if it is worth

35:06.720 --> 35:11.120
catching it's not gonna catch by you signing into move on org and RSVPing

35:11.120 --> 35:14.960
to a thing that texts you when it's convenient to drop off the kids and show

35:14.960 --> 35:22.520
up for a sit-in I really should start a business a child watch thing for

35:22.520 --> 35:25.640
protests right I mean that's essentially what they've created they created a

35:25.640 --> 35:28.920
they created a list that you can RSVP to because they want you know so that we

35:28.920 --> 35:36.400
can create a a nationwide within 24 hour rapid response however symbolic to

35:36.400 --> 35:41.000
this event that the attempt on the enemy's part is to just let it happen

35:41.000 --> 35:47.160
and and you're you're you're nothing it's not it's invisible it just happens

35:47.160 --> 35:51.360
and nothing happens because you can't do anything and we just we just we're just

35:51.360 --> 35:55.120
girding our loins because we at least want to say called it we called this

35:55.120 --> 35:58.880
like don't fucking do it maybe it's important at least just to take that

35:58.880 --> 36:02.360
posture and just stand over that plate of cookies and look at that little

36:02.360 --> 36:06.320
sociopath with the chocolate all over his face and the dog's leg in his back

36:06.320 --> 36:10.600
pocket and go I'm watching you Toby I'm not your parent but your fucking mom

36:10.600 --> 36:13.960
shouldn't have brought you here and you're you you you watch too much

36:13.960 --> 36:21.760
television or multiple choices well so I think that you you bring up a good

36:21.760 --> 36:25.080
point like the desire the intense desire to be like you're fucking wrong

36:25.080 --> 36:28.600
everybody knows you're wrong you're a fucking asshole and and I hate you and

36:28.600 --> 36:32.280
everybody deserves to watch you fucking your pants fall down around your ankles

36:32.280 --> 36:35.960
and you don't trip and fall off a bridge we all want to see that but my thing is

36:35.960 --> 36:39.920
like let's look at power let's look at materially how these things affect us if

36:39.920 --> 36:44.360
Trump is forced to resign and Mike Pence becomes president materially our

36:44.360 --> 36:47.600
lives aren't going to be that much different now we're not going to be

36:47.600 --> 36:52.400
bombarded by psychic hatred and grotesque awfulness from the news all the

36:52.400 --> 36:57.120
time because Mike that sounds really really nice but wait wait like our

36:57.120 --> 37:01.400
lives are going to be different because Pence has positions that are worse than

37:01.400 --> 37:04.640
Trump's Pence does have some positions that are far worse than Trump as far as

37:04.640 --> 37:08.640
his actual belief of his own religious elitry like leads to some really crazy

37:08.640 --> 37:13.960
shit and you saw like an AIDS breakout in Indiana which makes no sense because

37:13.960 --> 37:19.320
nobody fucks there and then that's just how bad of a governor he was says it on

37:19.320 --> 37:27.680
the license plate yeah it is yeah we're the worst so but like materially what

37:27.680 --> 37:31.600
can where can we we're only strong when we come together right we're only strong

37:31.600 --> 37:35.560
when we come together collective power like any of us individually can't do

37:35.560 --> 37:39.280
shit that's like the the net neutrality thing right and and I also disagree I

37:39.280 --> 37:43.680
don't think we can do just like boycotts or like economically based we need to

37:43.680 --> 37:48.360
look at how power is leveraged and how we coming together I think the women's

37:48.360 --> 37:51.320
march is really good because it allowed a bunch of people to come together and

37:51.320 --> 37:54.960
go hey you want to fight for this I want to fight for this let's like get to know

37:54.960 --> 37:58.560
each other and figure this out so the next time there's a mass movement there

37:58.560 --> 38:04.200
are demands that we all agree on to raise no money did they see here's a thing

38:04.200 --> 38:09.360
had they raised some money that day for like any female charity I might be

38:09.360 --> 38:14.280
super impressed but like I am impressed I'm impressed by us all showing up but

38:14.280 --> 38:19.800
I'm getting real tired of us trying to buy our way out of the shit by sending

38:19.800 --> 38:23.960
somebody to a broken-ass Congress or to a broken political system well we know

38:23.960 --> 38:29.040
goddamn well that if we had spent five bucks on the motherfucker next to us we

38:29.040 --> 38:32.680
wouldn't be in this situation that is at the end of the day the thing that you

38:32.680 --> 38:37.160
can do you get as mad as you want to about court systems in Congress and the

38:37.160 --> 38:40.640
political sphere and the president and the fact that third-party voters did

38:40.640 --> 38:44.840
this and the Republicans did that or you can actually reach down make sure the

38:44.840 --> 38:50.040
motherfucker with in who's right in front of you is eating how we done that in the

38:50.040 --> 38:53.720
first place we wouldn't be victims but now they're trying to scare us every

38:53.720 --> 38:57.360
week they come out with I'm moving this to Jerusalem I'm doing this shit they

38:57.360 --> 38:59.360
ain't doing half the shit they telling us they're going to do and they got a

38:59.360 --> 39:03.000
scared you don't scare me by telling me you about to pull the cord on my

39:03.000 --> 39:07.460
motherfucking internet you scare me when you're at my front door I think they

39:07.460 --> 39:11.600
will be at our front door soon so when I look at all this internet shit I'm like

39:11.600 --> 39:17.320
you are joking that we're upset about it FBI Russia motherfucker they killing more

39:17.320 --> 39:23.000
black dudes every fucking month this year you talking to me about Russia y'all

39:23.000 --> 39:26.840
motherfuckers can't even get one white dude and you killing black people

39:26.840 --> 39:31.400
innocently and I'm supposed to be upset about Mueller I know what's coming I

39:31.400 --> 39:35.600
know exactly what the fuck is coming and it's not gonna be internet neutrality

39:35.600 --> 39:40.360
shit it's not gonna be FBI shit but my ass is close to getting rounded the fuck

39:40.360 --> 39:45.040
up so when I look at the big picture I don't care who y'all got in the White

39:45.040 --> 39:48.880
House if you motherfuckers don't pull the boot off my neck and my voice just

39:48.880 --> 39:57.160
cracked plus we're all wearing ridiculous things on our heads you can see mine

39:57.160 --> 40:03.280
and I could see yours but we can't see our own there's a clip of you with the

40:03.280 --> 40:10.960
radio motherfucker tell me what we are here trying to fly for Santa not to

40:10.960 --> 40:17.520
detract from that I was very well said you know I I don't I don't see I I'm

40:17.520 --> 40:25.760
not gonna I feel like I diminished what you just said by saying I get it I don't

40:25.760 --> 40:30.480
I don't I if waters it down for me to say I get it like I don't fucking get all

40:30.480 --> 40:37.760
of it I I I get that I don't get it when you talk like that I get that that

40:37.760 --> 40:42.640
there is a bigger picture here I I always like from the very beginning like

40:42.640 --> 40:47.280
you know the day after the election you know a huge part of the wallpaper in

40:47.280 --> 40:53.120
this redecorated room was you know okay white people who have never complained

40:53.120 --> 40:58.040
about anything except for maybe that Spongebob's movie wasn't had had you

40:58.040 --> 41:05.400
know it was overtones in the second act that the frozen girls skirt was too

41:05.400 --> 41:08.880
slit when she sang actually that's an opinion of mine I think I find that a

41:08.880 --> 41:14.280
very very disempowering film just high heels and sequins and I said let let

41:14.280 --> 41:18.920
what go she's let nothing go yeah she can barely walk it's freezing and the

41:18.920 --> 41:23.040
ice is like everywhere how can you walk in heels like those shoes have one

41:23.040 --> 41:26.640
purpose okay to make your ass look better for me that's it you can't tell me

41:26.640 --> 41:29.400
that you're by yourself and you're running around in those heels right let

41:29.400 --> 41:32.880
it go let it go girls put on some sensible

41:32.880 --> 41:39.720
hugs that I can really get turned on by maybe some tights yeah I did the deck is

41:39.720 --> 41:45.440
loaded so I just I just don't find high heels attractive the the alright so so

41:45.440 --> 41:53.080
so god damn it what did I do there the the it was it was always about like you

41:53.080 --> 41:57.200
know we joked about it I mean no one was ever but it was like basically the

41:57.200 --> 42:01.640
general the very very like joking way to put it was like you know what we're on

42:01.640 --> 42:05.040
the bench at this point like you speaking on behalf of black people like

42:05.040 --> 42:09.280
like your turn like let's see what you're gonna do if you're really that

42:09.280 --> 42:14.560
upset about this and what you're gonna do and and and it's been a year and we

42:14.560 --> 42:18.880
don't do a lot not a lot not a lot has changed my focus say they want to do

42:18.880 --> 42:22.840
we're like we're getting we got it we got our shorts on and it's like our you

42:22.840 --> 42:26.280
can see the tan lines from because we've never wear shorts and then we're

42:26.280 --> 42:31.480
like we're like we're we're obsessed with things like whistles and like we

42:31.480 --> 42:36.320
don't we're trying to get the referee there's a lot of stretches that we

42:36.320 --> 42:39.120
haven't played in a really long time we've been on the bench for a while

42:39.120 --> 42:42.880
and that's true it's hard to mobilize or whatever the version of the bench is the

42:42.880 --> 42:46.440
box the fucking box where you run the game well that's what yoga is it's us

42:46.440 --> 42:50.520
stretching getting ready for the race war and it's just like constantly we're

42:50.520 --> 42:54.200
just stretching really we're gonna get we're gonna be in the right physical

42:54.200 --> 42:59.760
stature to you know fight the drones perhaps we could expound on my

42:59.760 --> 43:04.960
unfortunate professional sports metaphors for ethnic demographics but

43:04.960 --> 43:11.800
bringing up our ghost of Christmas past it's I hear it on the rooftop I hear

43:11.800 --> 43:19.600
strange mysterious clickings and tappings could it be do more horge

43:19.600 --> 43:29.160
brown what what's a Christmas episode he was making the clicking and tapping

43:29.160 --> 43:39.960
hi hi how are you demarche brown I'm so good to see you buddy good to see you

43:39.960 --> 43:44.880
man I haven't seen you in a long too long too long you look so so distinguished

43:44.880 --> 43:48.080
really I wish I could I wish I could bring it in like that with the rich oh

43:48.080 --> 43:54.240
where where have you been I don't think we tell him what we told him where we

43:54.240 --> 44:01.520
went to oh I just went going he kept going to melton Sundays looking for the

44:01.520 --> 44:16.240
fans I bring a bag of lunch no no no I just I worked on a short film a long

44:16.240 --> 44:20.560
time ago which actually just came out and the preparation for it started right

44:20.560 --> 44:23.880
before the last time that I did the show and it's probably about three and a half

44:23.880 --> 44:30.800
weeks worth of prep and then shooting the film took about a week two weeks and

44:30.800 --> 44:35.800
then from there yeah how was it how was shooting shooting was great I feel it's

44:35.800 --> 44:41.400
called I was there too yeah Joey is over it's a short film it's just came out

44:41.400 --> 44:45.480
this week is short of the week and it's on no budget to Kentucky Rodley's no

44:45.480 --> 44:49.880
budge calm that kind of stuff so that's great yeah to more just great tonight

44:49.880 --> 44:57.080
oh awesome all right well we'll check it out then but it was like I mean that's

44:57.080 --> 45:01.960
started a run of just sort of you were like well what I'm sure what you're

45:01.960 --> 45:05.000
waiting for this place for three weeks you're like why am I good what am I what

45:05.000 --> 45:10.720
was I doing get my Sundays back yeah yeah I mean if I took a couple breaks from

45:10.720 --> 45:15.760
the show I'd definitely be like yeah wait well if I waited until I'm ready to do

45:15.760 --> 45:20.680
the show so do you what the guests the last guest was somebody who was

45:20.680 --> 45:26.240
incredibly important to me in my life it was a hot cheese Norman layer it was

45:26.240 --> 45:33.760
Norman Lear that was the last guest and I wanted desperately to be called up to

45:33.760 --> 45:37.320
ask to talk to him even say that or ask him questions or something like that and

45:37.320 --> 45:40.160
I didn't and I didn't get called up until like the very end I think he had just

45:40.160 --> 45:45.160
left who was it it was Norman Lear was it really oh I got to hang out earlier in

45:45.160 --> 45:50.680
a green room with him and it was like devastated I was just like geez man you

45:50.680 --> 45:55.880
went I swarmed him and he kind of just deflected it with Jedi sensibility and

45:55.880 --> 45:59.720
stuff and it was but it was really fun and it was great to have had so it was

45:59.720 --> 46:04.440
sort of it was a high note of that year but you were it was it was it was it was

46:04.440 --> 46:11.080
a wound to you that I didn't call you up or no it was just it was just a

46:11.080 --> 46:15.280
disappointment that I didn't get up to but that's not up to you that's up to

46:15.280 --> 46:18.360
fate and stuff you were like if I can put try putting words in your mouth a

46:18.360 --> 46:26.000
corrective wrong you you after that you were like well no why am I going if in

46:26.000 --> 46:30.040
the best case scenario like I might not even it was just weird because there were

46:30.040 --> 46:32.760
things he said when you first when you first brought him out and interviewed

46:32.760 --> 46:36.520
him that echoed things I said in the first time I'd ever been on Harmon's

46:36.520 --> 46:39.880
town about like the fact that we don't teach civics and the consequences of that

46:39.880 --> 46:44.560
are gonna kick us in the fucking butt and sure enough we got to October and we

46:44.560 --> 46:48.240
got kicked in the butt because people thought that this vote was a rubber room

46:48.240 --> 46:54.520
and you know they could go oh well Hillary guess what we're gonna stick it

46:54.520 --> 46:59.320
to you but not voting for you and then like it was a prom prom court yeah yeah

46:59.320 --> 47:02.880
it was like some kind of weird weird-ass situation we can easily sort of jump

47:02.880 --> 47:08.440
out of but um yeah but it wasn't no it wasn't about that it was just like it

47:08.440 --> 47:12.080
was just a fate of the day that was all I I thought it was a highlight of my year

47:12.080 --> 47:17.360
really to have been anywhere around that guy just a favorite Norman Lear stuff

47:17.360 --> 47:21.720
but you did mention not getting called up like hiring Paul Mooney well I didn't

47:21.720 --> 47:25.360
get caught as a writer I didn't get called up to be on the show so if in the

47:25.360 --> 47:30.040
event of my one of my heroes being on the show if it's possible for me to be

47:30.040 --> 47:35.000
stuck in the green room yeah you I was just saying man I was but I was in the

47:35.000 --> 47:40.480
back one come on man there were no seats there were no seats and that guy fills

47:40.480 --> 47:45.880
too yeah and he and there was so much to say yes it's just a

47:45.880 --> 47:51.640
Norman Lear's death I like the part where I like that I echoed some of your

47:51.640 --> 47:55.880
thoughts I took that as a compliment yeah yeah it was it was important or it was

47:55.880 --> 48:01.040
an accusation of biting biting your moves you say you're you're you're like did I

48:01.040 --> 48:08.000
the court will decide all right nothing nothing crazy nothing

48:08.000 --> 48:11.120
special just working my ass off and really well you take it yeah you'd

48:11.120 --> 48:13.800
take in like breaks before and then every time you come back I go where were

48:13.800 --> 48:17.480
you what did I do wrong and it's like the answers never you know it never

48:17.480 --> 48:21.200
satisfies my narcissistic like map of the universe like it's some reason of

48:21.200 --> 48:26.480
your own but this was an especially long absence so just it just got your

48:26.480 --> 48:32.120
point was I got I mean I'm about here to be an actor and to write direct stuff

48:32.120 --> 48:36.760
and I'm just like trying to smash fill my year I mean you know me I just I feel

48:36.760 --> 48:41.040
my year up as much as I can with as much stuff as I can and I've been working

48:41.040 --> 48:45.840
with a director because of these I signed up much in the a so I can't say a

48:45.840 --> 48:48.000
whole bunch of shit but there's a director whose next film was coming out

48:48.000 --> 48:51.600
he'd won an Oscar and this is his next film and it was just sort of like

48:51.600 --> 48:57.520
working at Ratner yeah right right it's Brian singer is a Medeo you know it's

48:57.520 --> 49:02.560
an Eddie Murphy project yeah but it was but it was just like several times over

49:02.560 --> 49:06.360
the course of that year to try and then get his next thing into shape so they

49:06.360 --> 49:10.640
could shoot it which they did and then the next thing was like I had that I

49:10.640 --> 49:14.800
ended up working on a thing called the dress-up the dress-up gang on TBS and

49:14.800 --> 49:19.200
that took a big chunk of time and so that's it you know that's a it's just

49:19.200 --> 49:22.400
really I'm worn out right now at the end of the year like physically worn out

49:22.400 --> 49:26.880
just year-weary basically well maybe we could put some energy in your Christmas

49:26.880 --> 49:38.000
pants with a visit from the Rudolph of the Harmontown sleigh Mr. Rob Schrab the

49:38.000 --> 49:50.720
crazy Rob Schrab. What a crazy guy. This is Rob Schrab's 971st appearance on Harmontown. Crazy Rob Schrab.

49:50.720 --> 49:55.920
Rob coming to the show. Crazy Rob Schrab. You'll remember him from Old Man Walking.

49:55.920 --> 50:00.320
Crazy Rob Schrab. Old Man Walking. He's the man that never stops.

50:00.320 --> 50:07.760
He's a classic feature film. Crazy. How are you Rob? Hello Daniel. What have you been doing during

50:07.760 --> 50:15.200
DeMorge's absence? Why is this about me? I don't know just been kind of hanging out

50:15.200 --> 50:24.880
watching a lot of television spend some quality time with my dog been eating

50:24.880 --> 50:35.360
eating a lot of carbs white rice chips plain plain white rice plain white

50:35.360 --> 50:49.600
rice and soda. Alright Rob Schrab. Isn't that crazy? How do you make rice Rob? Isn't that

50:49.600 --> 50:58.800
crazy? I order it from Eat24. You should really get it from Asia. I don't know

50:58.800 --> 51:09.440
where Eat24 gets it from. Maybe they get it from Asia. Do you share it? No you can't

51:09.440 --> 51:18.960
have any. I ate it already. Eat24 gets it from really inhumane rice farms. Factory farms.

51:18.960 --> 51:24.880
You don't know that. Where the rice is forced to watch itself masturbate. I heard it's not

51:24.880 --> 51:30.720
inhumane rice farms. It's literally human rice farms. Have a cookie. Are you sure that's a

51:30.720 --> 51:41.600
vegan one? Vegan. Saved your shit brother. Almost ate some cruelty. Rob how do you think

51:41.600 --> 51:48.000
the black voters did in Alabama? I think you know something. I think they did a really good job.

51:48.000 --> 51:59.440
So brave. They did a fantastic job. It was a big election for us. I have white people

51:59.440 --> 52:03.360
studying black people. I'm sure black people are also studying black people too in the

52:03.920 --> 52:08.480
epilogue of the election. But it's like there's just a lot of like white voter,

52:08.480 --> 52:14.080
black voter talk all over all of the podcasts and all of the analysis which is really interesting

52:14.080 --> 52:26.400
because the bad guys are there's conspiracy theories about buses of people. In case any of

52:26.400 --> 52:33.200
you up here are black I don't see the world through that lens. What was your opinion if any

52:33.200 --> 52:38.800
specific like about the coverage that you heard after the Alabama election like in terms of people

52:38.800 --> 52:43.360
like I don't know telling the story like was there anything offensive about it or is it all

52:43.360 --> 52:54.640
like? No they did it great. I was listening to Pod Save America and listening to their

52:54.640 --> 52:59.280
facts and figures. It's just such a fascinating election because it's like you couldn't have

52:59.280 --> 53:08.080
had any prediction about it that if you predicted that there was going to be a measurable victory

53:08.080 --> 53:11.520
on either side then you would have been shocked by the fact that it was like

53:11.520 --> 53:18.000
like fucking ping-pong ball on top of the net. If you predicted ping-pong ball on top of the net

53:20.160 --> 53:25.680
you know how does it feel to be that right? I mean look at the president was said before that

53:25.680 --> 53:35.200
I mean you had in the first Obama election he steadily gained ground gained momentum demonstrated

53:35.200 --> 53:44.400
impact control grace fought off Hillary even in her weird contentious sort of giving up of the

53:44.400 --> 53:51.120
nomination and then you get you get to this dismount that the Republicans said they had the election

53:51.120 --> 53:56.800
and this dismount they did where they had they revealed they theatrically revealed their vice

53:56.800 --> 54:01.920
presidential candidate Sarah Palin and gave her a week to completely fuck that up with I can see

54:01.920 --> 54:10.320
Russia etc etc etc and then the economy fell apart and that can only be blamed on the administration

54:10.320 --> 54:18.080
before it and he still barely if you look at those numbers barely barely barely won that election

54:18.080 --> 54:25.440
and then after four years where they didn't do anything else really to upend what the Democrats

54:25.440 --> 54:33.440
have said in motion he's still you know I mean Romney really had to lose that last debate for

54:33.440 --> 54:37.360
the numbers to kind of switch around the way they did at the end of that that second election but

54:37.360 --> 54:42.640
that was all dependent on Romney really screwing that up so going into this one in and your and

54:42.640 --> 54:49.840
it's a home court I mean you're just you're in Alabama so how could that not be a ball on the

54:49.840 --> 54:55.440
net sort of victory where you're just standing it's a net court victory was actually like the

54:55.440 --> 55:01.920
interpretation is that the ball on the net victory is like a huge like come from behind like landslide

55:01.920 --> 55:06.880
like mobilization effort for the for the last I didn't see it as a come from behind I mean we knew

55:06.880 --> 55:12.480
everybody was fighting for one thing in motion but but the establishment that they were fighting

55:12.480 --> 55:17.840
against was solid was brick solid and was there and there was there's no way that was going to be a

55:17.840 --> 55:22.800
blowout that was going to be as close as it was we're all it was all execution dependent everybody

55:22.800 --> 55:29.120
is over the moon happy with what happened well it's not pedophiles pedophiles are pretty upset

55:29.120 --> 55:35.200
with what happened and we also started the drive so in the black community we'd already been familiar

55:35.200 --> 55:41.440
with the Moore and the Jones race now for eight months a year like on all your black female friends

55:41.440 --> 55:45.920
over 50 on facebook in the states that you're not even in they were like you getting out the

55:45.920 --> 55:51.200
conversation the conversations being had people were mobilizing you know months ago so even though

55:51.200 --> 55:56.720
that media coverage just got to it right we'd already been like we were voting to save what little

55:56.720 --> 56:01.200
we have you know what are the numbers that meant anything to me were the the actual percentage

56:01.200 --> 56:07.440
polls that were taken on key issues as voted by black women which if you look at it it was

56:07.440 --> 56:11.440
sort of like oh there's no way they're having any of this bullshit there was no equivocating on that

56:11.440 --> 56:18.080
that was all 97 97 97 97 no yes no yes on those I keep thinking of a scenario the bigger white

56:18.080 --> 56:22.640
guilt scenario than like watching this battlefield in the middle of nowhere where there's like one

56:22.640 --> 56:29.600
guy is like I want to fuck girls little girls and then like the other side is like take that and

56:29.600 --> 56:34.800
their swords are like bouncing off of his pedophile armor and I'm just like watching it going like

56:34.800 --> 56:40.000
well this is strategic for us this will eventually inconvenience how much I wipe my ass with dollar

56:40.000 --> 56:45.920
bills or but uh and then and then there's like to do to do and like like the elves and Lord of

56:45.920 --> 56:51.040
the Rings black voters come over the hill and like and because of that we won we beat a sex

56:51.040 --> 56:57.200
offender by one percent it's like a scary moment where you're like now I'm like well we're not going

56:57.200 --> 57:02.800
to do anything for the Alabama black families I am just going to take some wild guesses here I

57:02.800 --> 57:11.200
don't think your elves I think that I have a feeling that their garbage doesn't get taken

57:11.200 --> 57:16.080
out very quickly that there that there's probably environmental like I don't know it's probably

57:16.080 --> 57:21.120
like a shitty life that's not that's kind of a little bit disenfranchised it is that is that

57:21.120 --> 57:24.400
whatever we don't we don't cross section of where we are right now which is to say that

57:25.520 --> 57:31.280
in stasis these numbers are daunting but in actuality if you if you if you connect a size

57:31.280 --> 57:37.120
this thing we are moving in the right direction there's no gradient that's going to do that

57:37.120 --> 57:41.680
that's not predictive so you kind of have to trust that that's where it's going and you guys know

57:41.680 --> 57:47.120
it's not like I don't think that this country is breeding uh rednecks

57:49.280 --> 57:55.840
at a rate that is commensurate with the way they were breeding them you know true and in the 1970s

57:55.840 --> 58:00.960
man you're like as well yeah you're in total agreement with the nazis that's a negative we're

58:00.960 --> 58:06.560
gonna breed faster they regulated the redneck breeding uh companies and now they all got to

58:06.560 --> 58:14.000
be free range so you're getting fewer rednecks um yeah more expensive you got to pay for all

58:14.000 --> 58:19.280
those opiates and you guys know I don't see your race when I talk to you right I don't think that

58:19.280 --> 58:23.440
your spokesman for I'm not gonna sit here for the mammification of America black women didn't

58:23.440 --> 58:28.960
save you we don't work for you everybody want to lean over oh black women black women 94 percent

58:28.960 --> 58:32.880
of that vote was black man but you still want to be racist even in your compliment

58:35.840 --> 58:40.320
four percentage points and think about that I'm gonna agree with the reindeer on my left all the

58:40.320 --> 58:46.480
brothers that wasn't incarcerated weren't ex felons we lose so much of our voting ability to begin with

58:46.480 --> 58:51.840
so for 94 percent to show up that's pretty that's pretty damn impressive trued off the rednose reindeer

58:51.840 --> 58:58.000
dude hell yeah I can only run the simulator in my head where if I was part of a group I could

58:58.000 --> 59:02.960
barely be bothered to vote when I was like yeah so it's pretty crazy but like oh what are we

59:02.960 --> 59:09.920
fucking like it's like I'm voting for more peanuts in my shit like because technically that's nutrition

59:09.920 --> 59:15.120
like I would be yeah all right well we can we can drop all that behind that's not it's I don't

59:15.120 --> 59:19.520
excel when I'm talking about this stuff I just wanted to mark the the history of it uh Spencer

59:19.520 --> 59:24.640
how are you doing are you uh don't don't take my cue oh how are you doing sorry I didn't mean

59:24.640 --> 59:28.960
to interrupt your oh I thought you were like taking a cue that I was bored with the discussion

59:28.960 --> 59:34.720
no no no I and I was I accidentally I accidentally policed you for texting during the podcast it's

59:34.720 --> 59:42.880
great and I feel properly policed and I'm never gonna pull no um how are you guys doing I'm doing

59:42.880 --> 59:50.720
okay uh I've just been uh I went to the Apple store to get an iPad fix oh yeah you had to get

59:50.720 --> 59:55.600
my iPad fixed it was great because I went to get a four hour deep clean at the dentist and uh you

59:55.600 --> 01:00:02.000
guys you guys you guys talked to me about privilege uh uh listen to yeah four hour why what's that

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:09.200
look what's that like a four feels great what's a four hour deep cleaning what's that like I I feel

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:14.080
like it's a scam like the more I think about it the more it seems like you know what you need is

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:19.440
four hours of dentistry do they do it really what what are they doing to your teeth for four

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:25.200
used a laser they put each of them in a hyperbaric chamber each tooth they went by quadrants they did

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:33.920
the quadrants that's the way to do it in the mouth well they they went they went like they went like

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:39.280
one side up down the other side what with what with what do you mean with what dental tools what the

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:45.440
fuck with what well what dental tools there's a I can't see them they're in my mouth lasers all right

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:52.000
there's lasers for four hours they brushed your teeth I am going to do a quadrant I am gonna go into

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.080
all your quadrants Dan I asked your teeth starting with the upper left for four hours I asked about

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:05.440
one because fall asleep did you stay awake did you read anything I put a I put a Brian Eno song

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:13.200
for that was 45 minutes long on my on my iPad and you played it four times yeah did you really

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.720
well but until the point where the iPad fell down and the plug that it was plugged into the wall

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:25.200
with the little lightning cable snapped off inside the charging hole for the iPad rendering it

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:32.320
unchargeable and tweezers oh no and when I tell you Spencer couldn't get that thing out of there

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:37.680
he really couldn't we were at a fucking place that has the smallest tools in the world

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:44.560
and then you couldn't listen to your Brian Eno no he could but only for a limited time right

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:50.320
so for a limited time only yeah so don't talk to me about privilege

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:57.600
for court quadrants for four hours Brian Eno I asked her mother fucker I asked her what she

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.400
was doing for one tool I can answer your question because there was a smell there was smoke and a

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:09.840
smell laser as I just said there's a laser oh shit your teeth are disinfecting just disinfecting

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:15.360
the gums basically it's like you know my guns are all fucking piled up and like sure filth is

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:23.280
part of my teeth so they they had to like sandblast it and like take fishing hooks and scrape all of

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:29.600
the fucking brown sludge that there was a there was a there was a species of fucking amoeba in

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:35.280
there they discovered I guess I'm gonna make like 50 grand off of that at MIT or something

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:41.760
they named it after me there was like a horseshoe crab they found there was they actually found

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:47.040
evidence that during the industrial revolution so you're saying your teeth were dirty you had some

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.200
dirty teeth these are some dirty gums folks you had some dirty teeth there you're saying your

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.480
teeth were dirty when there's that much I guess there's something about the distance between your

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.480
teeth oh that shit you know so they they had a fucking sandblast my teeth it took I believe it

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:04.160
would take four hours it's been 44 years did you brush your teeth since I fucking brushed my

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:09.200
teeth basically let's be honest yeah how's it feel yeah feels good feels amazing right yeah

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.720
I'm gonna do it again it's in 44 more years okay all right that's why like Cody said you're not

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.520
gonna brush your teeth like like like later that night I'm like I just found out I can go 44 years

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:27.840
look what do you do you mouthwash your gum do I mouthwash my gum do you do mouthwash or

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:34.160

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:44.560
do you mouthwash with gum I don't I will I brush my teeth in the morning okay great end of story

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:52.720
is it look I'm not a picture of oral health like I'm I admit it like I don't want women to see

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.600
inside my mouth I got they would marry me if I got shot in the eye with a laser on Friday

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:05.200
and at his dentist yeah at the dentist no because when he just walks into the dental room like

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:11.040
yeah she was like shooting you get lasik you get some lasik not on purpose no I went to the physical

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:16.320
therapist and they have a laser therapy by where they strap a laser onto a part of your body and

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:22.960
shoot it with lasers what and this is a game we played in the 80s the strap was loose and it came

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:28.880
loose and I saw it coming loose and I saw it in the sense that it came loose and shot a laser into

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:34.880
my eye before I realized I should look away and not look at it and then I fixed it but I was like

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:40.000
I don't I was so embarrassed like I didn't want to tell anyone it was like bad I mean it was like

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:45.760
my eye started hurting and like it was definitely like when you look at the sun or whatever and

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:51.040
you get like a vision splotch it was like I was like no good I was like man this would be amazing

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:56.320
if I have to get an eye patch from this but I think I'll be okay but it was bad it was like

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:01.120
it was hurting for about two days whoa it's fine today is this the place that cupped you

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:07.920
no no this is a physical therapy cup to no not a cat it's just uh just uh lasers and what are

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.920
they usually talking about cupping like they're usually lasers to like measure your posture or

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:17.200
no it's uh it's a it's a form of therapy they they shoot it with lasers I think the idea is

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:22.960
it stimulates the tissue but the thing is a medical laser is a stronger laser than normal lasers

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.760
and it was in the the medical lasers that they used to affect your tissue or the exact radiation

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:33.200
or wavelength that's the worst for eyes so you're gonna have one whole guy yeah it's gonna be it's

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:39.920
gonna turn green and stuff his eye if it has to save its eyes baby well it could lift a car

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:46.800
um the the I just I just don't understand lasers that hit your skin and then they're

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.080
like stimulating the tissue underneath it but it goes through it's nice to me though because

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:56.720
my friend does is what my friend does cupping and then she comes out and she goes then she shows you

01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:01.200
shows me her back or whatever and it just their rings like bruises yeah like these bruise rings

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:07.360
at last I talk about cupping but I don't want to be cyberbullied so uh question we don't well

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:13.520
don't worry just just he's just trying to leave a paper trail for his is it no it's a crazy thing

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:20.480
oh did your you talked to a girl and she she got cupped so she had bruises all over oh I failed

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:24.640
the cup I just I don't I didn't understand I don't understand it doesn't know what it's pseudo

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:30.560
sites cups every day of course he does yeah he was supposed to engage your lymphatic system

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:35.120
supposedly it sort of pulls the toxins to the surface of the skin right then your lymphatic

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:42.000
system kind of gets rid of them because sounds like leeches how does a laser how does a laser I

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.760
don't understand that electromagnetic radiation goes through most objects generally so I think

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:52.640
it's in a wavelength that is thin enough or wide enough to go through your tissues and doing so it's

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:58.640
like a low rate way microwave and so I think it just damages the muscles and then that stimulates

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:04.640
them enough to do regrow or whatever that's the understanding I don't know it seems like it's supposed

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:10.720
to be kind of like yeah I don't know hmm isn't that just what walking does I think a lot of stuff

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:18.640
does that it strengthens your muscles so you don't need to do lasers I mean it's physical therapy

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:24.160
I just want to know whether or not I should get lasers on my body or I mean you can buy a laser

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:29.520
machine for yourself for a couple thousand dollars and do it and I think you really

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:35.600
roid out hell yeah dude but you might go blind has anyone the laser guy already does everyone have

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.120
that as their identity not man I might try it out in the new year you mean like in the marvel

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:45.040
universe no in the real universe all right right not in the real universe self cup yeah oh man if

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.600
I could self cup I'd never leave the house no one has seen new star wars I know I've seen it and

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:59.520
oh no I have seen it what do you love it any cup I love it what about those porgs what about guys those

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:07.440
porgs what about this Star Trek Quentin Tarantino movie everyone's talking about I hope there's

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:14.080
porgs in it haven't heard of it did you know when a dog sits and does that thing with his hind legs

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:20.880
moving on well no it's related that's called a splute a splute wait when they lay on their belly

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:25.680
and their legs and their back legs look like a chicken like a like a chicken on a plate blue

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:32.080
I like it corgis I like it corgis do it it's called splitting or is it just called engaging in a

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:36.240
splitting around all right well yeah but it was related to the pork thing robbed you can't

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:43.440
it porgs blue in the movie yeah all right well yeah so what is it isn't this the last Star Wars

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:49.200
movie are they gonna keep making yeah no this is the last one they're done all right Steve is upset

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:57.120
I thought I watched people I'm not I'm not any I don't judge anything at all any I'm about to turn

01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:03.360
45 and I'm I'm just I find it fascinating that Star Wars has gotten to this place where it's just

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:12.080
like this crazy it's gotten really popular remember when it was just this cult thing there's just a

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:20.080
few of us like now everybody likes Star Wars I was walking down the street and saw a little kid with

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:36.560
a Star Wars teacher done well I didn't that's not what I was saying I was just talking about how

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:41.920
it used to be it was just a cultural like thing that just kind of had a monolithic face to it it

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.240
was like yeah that's the Star Wars movies they come out every six years and they they're kind of

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:50.560
unquestionable and you can pick and moan about whether you liked Empire or Star Wars better and

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:57.040
now now it's just this crazy weird like Lego like universe where there's like one offs and and and

01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:02.160
guest directors and it's all called Star Wars and it's like amazing because it's the thing I gave

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.960
the most shit about ever and and I also have never seen a Transformers movie and there's like

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:13.120
nine of those and I I really loved Transformers I haven't seen any Transformers movie ever no the

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.840
new Star Wars also I haven't seen the new one because I don't even know what you should do

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:22.880
honestly is see the last Transformers movie because that was the biggest piece of shit I've

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:28.960
ever seen in my life I keep waiting for the last one you don't know no I'm sorry there's a dumb

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:33.440
plan words what is your what's your the last one was amazing I make it like every summer I do a

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.600
thing where I just go see a bad movie a week because it's you know summer's loaded with them

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.760
and I go to I usually go to the Highland theater just because the families come and they go and

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:48.000
they're the most responsive audience in the world and that last Transformers movie was crazy and

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.160
then like right when we get to the point where are you talking about the lot what do you mean when

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.400
you say the last one there's one that just came out and there's this summer the one that just came

01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:02.640
out right in July or June or July it's called the Lonely Jedi what's the last Transformers movie

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:05.520
oh you're talking about the last Transformers movie I'm talking about the last Transformers

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:11.520
okay all right yeah I haven't seen it which Transformer movie are we talking about the last one okay all

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:19.360
right this one is just it just it's just crazy there's 9000 elements in it none of which get

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:25.440
a full complete circle you're like narrative dealing and then they just kind of mark these

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:30.720
moments by chaos chaos chaos and then Walbert comes in and says oh my god you guys go get over

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:37.600
here go see this and then they'll like cut but then then they'll then they'll cut to Anthony

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:43.040
Hopkins who just walk out of nowhere and kind of like long ago several years ago Merlin I mean

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:50.160
this movie opens with it opens with Merlin Merlin is riding a horse Merlin is riding a horse and

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:59.120
he's fucking hammered and he stops the horse and then takes a swing oh he stops the horse and he

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.240
looks into the camera and says I'm sozzled and then he pulls a bottle out and drinks from it

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:12.800
and then rides up an evergreen cliff to a cave in Ireland somewhere where there is an original

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:19.200
Transformer crashed and injured that's where it starts does he throw his bottle down like so good

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:25.120
wait why does he break the fourth wall what's he doing because he's so sozzled the movie is

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:31.120
bad he really looks right at the camera there's an arcade there's an arcade of trees like this

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.280
and he's just riding down with the horse for no reason stops the horse and then you're like why

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.280
would you stop the horse and that's when he looks and goes I'm sozzled and then he pulls the trigger

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:43.280
you didn't see what's the catchphrase there was there was an all the I'm sozzled shirts in the

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.600
sozzled and this goes on but this goes on for the whole length of the movie and then there's a

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:52.320
there's like a I mean there's a cold open term but I guess there's like a clothes I get an

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:58.560
at or like an addendum at the end Schraba if you if you need to go you could go

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:08.320
Schraba Schraba came to the podcast sick he's a little under the weather he's a little sozzled

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:15.520
it but you can you don't have to why you gotta sit next to me

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:22.560
uh-huh uh all right so no let's shuffle the order of I would I would I would seriously that

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:26.960
but also last year I looked and I have an activity we can play for Christmas yes

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:34.640
uh so socialist Santa has brought uh some games yes some some some games yes so actually I will

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:41.520
leave but you are well Schraba doesn't like games that's why it's not that he doesn't like Santa

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:52.880
socialism yeah you can come back whenever they're so good so basically what I was thinking of when

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.680
I came up with these games is that we're all going to be with our families and talking about politics

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:03.040
and that's going to suck and lead to a bunch of arguments and so why don't we turn it into a game

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:08.320
okay because people love games Jimmy Fallon loves games so let's all be a little more like Jimmy

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:14.320
Fallon this holiday season yeah uh and and so uh I can get a jump on my new year's resolution

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:19.840
yeah doing a bunch of coke and drinking a lot um so that's like well known right I don't know

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:30.000
Jimmy Fallon's a sad person anyway uh this first game we're gonna play is called pot strain or

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.320
horrifying government operation code name and the way this game's work the way this game works

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:43.120
is I'm gonna name a thing and it is either a pot strain or a possible war crime and you have to

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:48.160
tell me the difference okay and so you can get bonus points if you've actually smoked the weed

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:57.200
in question oh that's honor system uh or if you guess what the uh operation was about okay and

01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:05.680
here we go starting with number one Asian fantasy Asian fantasy how do we buzz in or whatever I

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:15.360
think you just did government incorrect damn it is a pot strain uh let's do another one all American

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:24.720
tiger government operation that is correct this game is great it was to capture Saddam Hussein

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:30.320
lookalikes uh which that name all American tiger totally makes sense because Saddam Hussein was

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:35.520
on the cover tiger beat uh the next way I want to know more about that operation they're trying

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:41.680
to why were they trying to round up lookalikes of Saddam Hussein here in the states so that we could

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:49.200
drop them on iraq and confuse everyone please say a musical please say a musical it was a musical

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:53.040
honeypaw that's exactly what it was they trained them how to sing and dance and then they wanted

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:59.440
them to no it was to round up all his lookalikes in iraq uh to make sure that they weren't him

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:06.000
okay you know what I mean all right so in other words if he did have 50 lookalikes deployed

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:12.720
then that operation that we gave a fancy name to was just really operation his operation is working

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:17.680
yes 100% his operation there are too many guys that look like Saddam Hussein we're just playing

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:22.320
the captain crunch contest with him like like oh there's another one let's grab him and spend

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:28.720
time on this I imagine that that um that mission involved like a CIA guy going like with two Sadams

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:34.000
and the Sadams like it can't be me I can't be the real Sadam I don't know this like this is like a

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.720
Washington Post reporter has two of them cornered in a hotel lobby and it's like Ron it's me I was

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:43.200
at your bar mitzvah remember I'm the only one that remember you have that mole on the inside of your

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:50.720
legs uh okay next one I don't want any emails about my iraqi accent I think it was tasteful

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:58.640
uh white rhino that's definitely a weed I've smoked yeah bonus points that is definitely

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.480
a weed though bonus points you must have smoked that this is a socialist game so there are no

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:06.720
winners or losers we all get the same amount of prizes right yeah well we should all even

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:10.880
out our points eventually like right right we didn't redistribute the points to those who

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.200
don't have as many 100% and I wish I'd been I would have done the same way right now is name

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:21.840
that because it seems dangerous before you try it but it's only uh charging at you to get a closer

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:36.320
look yeah all right or stamp out your campfire all right next one viking snatch government

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:42.000
operation yeah and what do that is correct yeah and what do you think it was uh rounding up a

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:48.800
bunch of vikings it was uh it must have been off the coast of an island uh navy navy boats would

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:58.400
go around the coast of cuba and um look for uh uh people trying to get away uh pick them up

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.520
hypnotize them into thinking they were happy cubans and drop them back off uh and activate

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:09.200
them with a code phrase to assassinate castro that is actually 100 correct no no they gave

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:15.040
Guy Ritchie movies to Iceland I think it was a white supremacist infiltration you're the closest

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:19.360
it was to disrupt weapons smuggling by white supremacists because white supremacists think

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:24.560
they're fucking vikings they love vikings yeah viking snatch isn't that crazy it's absurd how many

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:30.320
like guys that are look like a lowercase letter b think that they're a viking they're like yeah I

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:40.080
got all the same traits uh next one here we go uh this is the last one rolling thunder oh yeah

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.400
that one I think I remember hearing yeah that was a that was a government operation that one I

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:51.280
think I remember smoking do you say it's a train government operation folks it's both what just

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:57.840
like it's socialism there's no losers all right what yeah what was the uh uh rolling what was the

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:04.080
government operation all I wrote down in the notes was both bitch in all caps so I have no idea what

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:09.920
that one is you were on the white rhino yeah um I have another game if you'd like to play love

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:16.240
games that one was fast and and fun here we go all right this game is called secret republican

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:23.120
rape apologist or animal phobia jesus christ so here's how this game works now that a reality tv

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:32.160
host is president uh are the politics of our nation's most valuable resource celebs is more important

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:35.680
than ever because which one of them might run for president you know like any one of them could run

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:42.160
for president so we're vetting we are now vetting because if you are a secret republican and you

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:46.400
run for democratic office you're gonna get caught if you're a rape apologist you're gonna get taken

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:52.720
down and if you're afraid of one specific animal y'all are gonna get roasted so we're just trying to

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:59.920
like clear the herd for 2020 shout out to matt damon shout out matt damon uh all right so here we go

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:04.320
again you have to tell me if they hide the fact that they're in the gop have publicly defended

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:09.040
a rapist or have a deep-seated fear of a specific animal okay and I made a name a celebrity can I

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:15.200
get like a little bit of like like guessing music maybe this one's gonna be tough because I think

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:25.520
we've all you know man I used to have the soundtrack for the price is right it was so great driving

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:30.000
around playing that price is right music but then if you like did something wrong and you heard

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.360
all right here we go just when you thought it was safe to guess just when you thought it was

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:48.480
safe to like a celebrity uh number one adam sandler adam sandler secret republican we know this

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:54.400
correct um not sure anybody in this circle has raped so I don't think he's a rape apologist

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:59.120
no it's just secret probably you're you're correct yeah and I'd also like to guess the last one what

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:05.600
is it no no it's it's animal no I'd like to guess the last one see you know the animal

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:14.880
rape rape republican yes you're right correct he's in the GOP okay next all right Kristen Stewart

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:21.440
well she's gotta have an animal phobia because everyone likes her that's correct she's afraid

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:26.640
of horses all right Kristen Stewart's afraid of horses are scary horses are scary they will bite

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:30.960
you that's my favorite animal they'll they'll they could do whatever they want to anybody

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:37.360
I mean I also I was thinking of Christian wig no Kristen Stewart sucks and she's shut down my

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:45.040
show babe island my old comedy show well case two I had your back accidentally okay wig you're next

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:53.760
quick whoopee Goldberg uh oh we know she's a big all right yeah dude she defended Bill Cosby

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:59.520
like way after and on the view like maybe the view isn't the right place to talk about

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:04.800
Bill Cosby I don't think we're doing the music the way you imagined us no I think it was right

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:08.800
that was that was a peak that was a peak maybe the view is not the place to apologize for Bill

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:17.040
Cosby was the great climax of the game I liked how that lined up yeah I got two more let's do it

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:24.400
Katie Holmes oh man what are the choices rape apologist secret republican or animal phobia well

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:29.040
we haven't had a rape apologist yet so I'll take whoopee we'll be super oh she okay she defended

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:36.320
Bill yeah okay secret republican the correct answer she's afraid of raccoons it's because

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:41.360
they've got thumbs right they've got the little hands they look just like ours the rest of them

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:45.360
don't look like us there's only two kinds of people in this world uh people that are afraid of

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:52.400
raccoons and people with a distinct raccoon wound right somewhere on their face those little

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:57.280
fuckers are like monkeys with no conscience they're monsters they're like street monkeys

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:03.280
they're monkeys live in your backyard not good street monkeys this is terrible

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:09.600
one of those smoke cigarettes is a raccoon kept coming in and through our doggie door

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:16.160
eating the dog food like raccoons I've talked about this on podcast it's a when you when you

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:21.760
discover a raccoon when you come upon one they they they stare you down yeah they just look at you

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:27.360
the skunks do that too but skunks are freezing and saying right are we gonna have to do this

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:34.960
I have things I can do to avoid the conflict raccoons are like war boys what yeah they're

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:40.000
like they're like what like what do you feel lucky punk and all that stuff like they just look at you

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:46.000
and then I the two times I've encountered a raccoon hold up my hands try and let me weapons

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:54.560
and I back away and the raccoon just like kind of like elevator looks me and like walks away like

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:59.280
shaking its hips all right anyways scary animal I love that you showed an animal with hands your

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:03.440
hands so that you could get out of there safe yeah like you have hands you know I'm not holding

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:10.480
a weapon but that but that I'm really scared I because if you google raccoon dog with like

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:17.280
like it's a I got a situation I I'm a really irresponsible dog dad I need a lockable doggie

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:24.960
door because my dogs are primed to get a fucking face mauling and I feel bad about that yeah

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.520
and they get big in our neighborhood they're big I think the coyotes ate those raccoons so

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:36.480
yeah we yeah we we we I think we eventually kind of we scared them off with coyote pee we hung coyote

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:40.800
pee from the from the from the chimney with care they just thought you were freaks you're like

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.720
why are they holding piss I don't want to hang out yeah why do these people have bags of piss

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:49.360
does Ed Gein live here we're out of here I'm a raccoon but this is fucking nuts dude I'm out of

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:55.040
here I love to eat trash all the time but this is gross we tried to set a humane trap we got a

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:59.600
humane trap that like has like a weird door that like you go in and then it closes behind you we

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:06.240
put some food in it next morning the neighbor's cat is in there fast fucker last question last

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:16.240
one Ivanka Trump oh definitely a strain of weed uh uh rape apologizing for afraid

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:27.840
well she she's uh rape apology I mean she's she's technically yeah she's a wait is she

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:35.040
though has she ever actually said is she all three yeah she's all three baby she likes to pretend

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:39.280
that she's not a republican but she definitely is she's a rape apologist and she's afraid of

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:45.760
Pokemon that's not one animal that's all animals all right so she's only two okay

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:57.440
nice that's a secret I got a game called the ham radio license exam practice test

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:03.840
okay you guys want to play that yeah let's hear some Spencer's gonna get his ham radio license

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:10.160
he's been ever since the day that we went in to the place next door to where it definitely did

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:16.240
not take a lot of time to buy my gun uh uh and we've been trying to get Spencer a ham radio

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:22.400
license and it's really really hard and he may never get it because it's not a gun right if it

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:27.200
was a gun this would be over with ages yes I have I've been my gun has been collecting dust on my

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:32.960
shelf for two months and Spencer is almost done maybe getting his ham radio license where it's

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:37.840
things are the same it's really dangerous to have a ham radio yeah think about all the businesses

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:41.680
you could negatively impact right think of the children whose minds you could work with

01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:46.080
you know all the kids that are on ham radio what if you played music on it right I don't know

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:52.400
I don't know I can't get wi-fi hold on keep going sorry that's because you're not in the

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:58.880
fast lane honky yeah net neutrality is happening net neutrality already started and this was ground

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:03.920
zero yep okay are you ready for the first throttle us so first they're gonna throttle us first they

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:08.160
hurt us we get fucking people with antlers over here talking about bringing down the curtain

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:13.440
at that GOP convention they caught someone on hot mics saying yeah we're already lining up rich

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:18.080
conservatives who are gonna rig the internet oh boy do in for some time all I gotta say is here's

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:23.440
the thing I may be a fucking fat dumb lazy guy that hasn't studied anything since high school but

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:28.400
here's here's my bird's eye view based on that the last thing I remember learning is here's the

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:33.680
fascism playbook they they have like a thing they have like a list of shit that they need to do in

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:38.160
order to swing a country fascist and take control of it and one of the top items on the list which

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:43.600
has been the eternal frustration to these pricks is that because of the internet you can't do what

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:49.440
the first step is which is just fucking take over the media you have to be able to black it out

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:54.640
and just like control it you got you can't have a free press and a fascist coup they don't work

01:27:54.640 --> 01:28:02.080
together so you know fascism like like really goes very quickly in in times when you can just go

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.880
and fire bomb a newspaper office and they haven't been able to do that now they're fucking doing it

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:14.960
it concerns me I don't want to have to find out what I'm made of you won't you you got it I'm safe

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:18.960
you're saying it's gonna take so long I'm saying I'll have my first coronary you're from good

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:24.640
fucking stock thank you you know this that's what I'm saying what are you saying are you saying when

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:28.960
they come through you're gonna fight and you're gonna win bro that's what I'm trying to tell you

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:33.280
or we're all gonna die from climate change before they have a chance you mean good stock like I have

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:36.880
a hero in here somewhere like I'm like a good person are you being my magical black person

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:43.120
are you like my mentor like like is that a is that place bullshit or do you already ask people

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:46.480
who don't take shit I mean what you guys do I can't beat anybody up is that what you're

01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:50.400
you're in play what did you guys do didn't you get rid of your governor I don't know we did some

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:55.120
stuff we had like a socialist mayor or something but we keep saying that over and over again but

01:28:55.120 --> 01:29:00.720
we're a bunch of Trumpy pumpies yeah but you used to be blue I don't know yeah you did and then

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:04.800
you got red and I bet you when we look at the big picture you can be red for a little while

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:10.960
but you're gonna be majority time blue this is a weird way to pump me up I was caught I was

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:18.320
gonna leave it and left that leaving you was cotton it's your home all right hand escape it

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:24.960
what is a part 15 device a an unlicensed device that may emit low powered radio signals on frequencies

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:32.240
used by a licensed service B a type of test set to use to return a type of test set used to determine

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:38.560
whether a transmitter is in compliance with FCC regulation ninety one point fifteen oh it's close

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:46.080
C a device for long distance communication using special code sanctioned by the IARU and D a type

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:53.440
of amateur radio that can legally be used in the citizens band D I'm gonna say C I'm gonna say D

01:29:53.440 --> 01:30:00.080
because it had the phrase citizens band there we go I'm gonna do D D D two part 15 I'm gonna say A

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:08.640
because I'm taking the test there might be it was a because yeah an unlicensed device that may

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:13.440
emit low powered radio signals on frequencies used by a licensed service based on my research

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:19.360
this includes walkie talkies oh hmm so is that like kids walkie talkies yeah those those operate

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:24.160
on amateur radio bands but they have those privileges even though they're commercial products

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:31.760
how easy are those to hack uh very I think they're built with I mean it's easy to make

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:36.560
your own radio I think I think that's easy enough but I don't you have like enough Bitcoin

01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:42.400
well yeah I mean these days okay enough Bitcoin there's a lot of Bitcoin and radio dude there's a

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:47.040
lot of money are you still are you still are you still high enough that Bitcoin I think I missed

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:50.720
the boat I mean I don't know do you think do you think it's here to stay do you think it's

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:55.040
it's I think it's here to stay for long enough to make money off of it I don't know it's pretty

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:59.360
hard to sell you think the boat you missed is like buying a big chunk on the ground floor

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:04.640
that would make you like like yeah like wealthy five years from now ten years from now I think

01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:09.920
one of your writers did something like that uh Matt roller bought a bit he bought a he bought

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:13.920
Bitcoin early I think so yeah I think he got on the ground floor a lot of people bought it but

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:19.600
you can't it's hard to sell yeah the game yeah but you you you you buy it you hang on yeah I mean

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:25.200
the game is Bitcoin only becomes valuable if everybody just decides to start using it and you

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:30.480
can't do that overnight so it's like yeah you're you're you're guessing that it's the cryptocurrency

01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:35.840
that would prevail there's a lot of a lot of big ifs there it's with still a lot of challenges

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:41.840
that's one thing unethical unethical yeah because it keeps poor people don't really have access to

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:48.160
Bitcoin what I had a guy on my podcast and Wilson yeah this other guy I had a guy on my podcast

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:53.360
I don't see him that way but I think I heard he was black and he I told him it was black he didn't

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:57.920
see it he had he had he had like he he said the same thing he said he said cryptocurrency is

01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:02.080
inherently it's just like wait are we supposed to be restart we're just we're just gonna restart

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:06.960
this inequality thing because black people aren't thinking about fucking Bitcoin like this is a chance

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:12.000
to to to change something and I can't remember I don't have and so he had and then I tuned him out

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.160
because I'm like this isn't for me it was an app and anyone can use it yeah got you on the ground

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:22.960
floor well I like I like to be special in the things I use so it's a cute concept there's a lot

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:28.240
of histories of bubbles tulip bubbles oh yeah well it's certainly a bubble currency like 30 years

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:33.840
ago they did the fuck's a tulip bubble the first bubble ever was the price of tulips oh well

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:39.200
people got really into tulips in Holland and tulips like threatened to become a currency

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:44.640
yeah well it was a currency because it was worth so much but it was crazy because it was inflation

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:49.920
just overnight people were like paying tons of money for tulip so what happened and it was seasonal

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:56.560
somebody decided one day literally somebody was like tulip bulbs ain't shit excuse me I have something

01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:02.800
to say these shit so someone finally just listened so then the bubble so then the bubble burst and

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:06.560
people's tulips weren't worth anything anymore and then they died right like that's the other problem

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:11.840
with like flowers is money well I think the bulbs last a while yeah oh these are the bulbs well I

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:16.000
revealed my lack of flour no I thought the same thing until they were talking about is that boom

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:24.800
Chicago but cryptocurrencies are superior to all existing currencies in that they actually are

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:29.520
even though we look at them as based on nothing they're more based on something than our current

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:35.520
currencies right and you can vape them your currency has actual you can trace it to an actual

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:40.560
source like a federal reserve bank which then would go straight to either gold or silver they say

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:44.560
that they're no longer on the gold or silver the truth of the matter is you can still take a dollar

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:50.880
and buy gold and silver and you can do that legally but you could buy do you mean go take a dollar and

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:56.240
buy gold and silver like you can buy a pokemon you can buy a I mean so that's just that doesn't

01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:01.440
count as the dollar being backed by something you're just saying that the dollar is backed by the

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:05.600
fact that everyone's using it yeah the dollar is backed on ultimately backed by faith but ultimately

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:12.640
the end result is gold all financial leads to gold if if that is the case then that means that bitcoin

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:17.200
from the limited understanding I can I can accomplish of it I think you know bitcoin is

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:22.000
mathematically guaranteed scarcity right so that you can you can actually control

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:29.440
it's built on algorithms that are meant to hopefully control for its expansion right

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:35.200
no nobody can nobody can find out by digging into the center of the earth that the core of

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:40.080
the earth is made of bitcoin and the market collapses right well the thing is you can steal

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:45.280
bitcoins kind of untraceably with some ease so that's something that it has is like a disadvantage

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:49.520
over money because I mean it's easy to steal money don't get me wrong but it's like easier to get

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:56.080
away with stealing money uh bitcoins just puked up at my throat let's get him another cup it's

01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:01.120
the but it's chocolate chip cookie puke it's delicious oh yeah it's that acidic yeah sugary

01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:14.960
all right let's let's do we have another do we have time for one more ham question should we go ham

01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:20.320
if you find it fun i have a politics uh multiple choice question if you like one of those yeah

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:26.240
how many times has ted cruz made his wife come okay is the answer a yeah right

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:33.120
b trick question she works for goldman sacks the only way that she can come is by signing

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:38.880
a predatory loan to a person of color or is the answer c on the third hottest night of the year

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:44.240
they kneel before the statue of ancient undersea god cropped locked and their eyes become hollow

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:49.520
as they turn into bleak darkness which technically is an orgasm if you went to yale i have to recuse

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:54.560
myself from this question and he's he can't tell us why but it's because of one of those

01:36:54.560 --> 01:37:05.520
answers for reasons i can i ds uh i support everyone's religion so i i'm gonna go a

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:13.760
a is correct yeah thank you oh shit um stump us with a ham question oh yeah no this one you might

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:19.360
get yeah which term describes the rate at which electrical energy is used which term describes

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:26.560
the rate at which electrical energy is used gotta have this one voltage b current c resistance or

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:38.080
d power the rate at which it's used is the answer currently one of the choices oh the rate at which

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:45.200
it's used yeah and the and the it says resistance voltage voltage current resistance or power

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:52.400
all right well it's it's it's not it's not resistance it's oh you know it's not current it's not current

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:57.440
it's voltage voltage right i'm gonna see whatever voltage is like the no no no voltage sounds like

01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:02.880
a rate well current is amperage isn't that isn't that the that's the that's that would that would be

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:09.680
like the the level that it's at across the the system if it's uh so the rate at which it's used

01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:15.840
okay all right i'm going voltage as well voltage because it's a measurement an index is that your

01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:22.720
guess no my guess is the right answer god shit it's power but didn't we but didn't we like lie well

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:27.920
you act and i really convinced in yourselves effectively did sound like we knew what we were

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:35.200
talking about that's a good part of testing skills that when i was five my dad had this bright idea

01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:41.600
to get become a kid i need a train set went out and bought a taiko uh god i forgot what scale but

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:48.240
it was a monstrous ho it wasn't h o so it's not taiko man barely oh jeez no z's ho i'm gonna get

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:57.040
into you uh and then he so christmas day comes i open this thing here it is i want him to help

01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:05.280
me set it up and he tells me no uh we can't do it my father didn't help me set it up he said we

01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:13.920
can't do it in this house because the voltage that we if we plug this into these walls the paint will

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:21.440
peel and so unfortunately son this train can't he just didn't want to set it up which is why at six

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:25.200
i set up the next train i got i set up myself i just read the insertion did myself but he like

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:31.600
literally lied and said the paint would peel if we tried it jeez that was your dad what was my dad

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:38.000
so do you do what what do you love more now him or trains okay my man that's a no brainer trains

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:43.680
well i just well sometimes we invert that stuff so it's like your dad you're like oh you're like

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:48.240
fuck a train and my dad's so amazing because he like because he taught me how to like build my own

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:52.800
train sets and kids kids twist shit get across the street for me uh could not wait for his father to

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:57.440
set up the track so he pulled the train out the box and broke it by playing with it on the carpet

01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:05.920
all day long like a dumbass uh my mom threw my 10th birthday cake at my father the kid across

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.840
the street same kid his mother would beat him with hot wheels tracks which is the darkest

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:15.360
shit in the world to be with his with those things the plastic like loopy loop one final dude

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.920
and if you put the connector in it then it was like a nice stinging tail at the end of it to like

01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:24.400
pop it it's the worst thing you've ever seen remember that JonBenét Ramsey thing where she

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:33.360
had the two uh won't contact wounds on her body and they they they uh deduced that it was uh

01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:41.360
her brother must have poked her already dead body with a railroad track a piece of railroad track

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:45.760
from the other room what we're saying is don't get your kids trains for christmas yeah it could

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:51.760
either end disappointment or death and that was it for trains that was then taiko line here on

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:56.880
behalf of the fine folks lionel lionel actually lionel ran into trouble financial trouble and

01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:03.600
almost failed but were saved by neil young who bought the entire company and resurrected it

01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:09.360
so i think lionel's a fine company right now wow christmas fun facts just so you know neil young

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:15.040
neil young bought it because his son he and his son bonded through two things one was the uh the

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:21.200
speech synthesizer that he had that was a Kurzweil i think and then also through trains and so now

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:26.160
he's got on his on his on his camp he's got this thing with kids come and they ride the big scale

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:30.240
like the l scale or something like that lionel train and they just ride him around and they and

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:36.080
they help maintain him and then they also like look at the big sort of smaller ho scale displays

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:43.280
that he has and they and they and he helps which brings things back to alabama sweet home i heard

01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:49.520
lennard skinnered is buying a their own model train that's called fuck you neil young fucking

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:58.960
tricycle oh god it's a deep cut a little war between those guys about alabama only about the

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:03.200
state of alabama though not right not about the politics involved well no there was a skinner

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:08.240
skinner was progressive no but skinnered was like their lyrics there's contention about that because

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:14.640
they're there if you listen to those skinnered lyrics they're referring to some racist shit

01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:19.280
some hot top hot button shit and they're just saying hey man you don't understand this we're

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:24.720
from the south you don't get it so shut up yeah but when you say that about a state i know i know

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:28.720
i was getting i didn't all right i was i was going well you're very dry i don't know i was

01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:34.720

01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:01.280
that's right yeah and you don't know if he's kidding because no i think he's honest because

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:06.960
he's told me multiple times each time like assuming i forgot like you'd forget someone like naming a

01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:14.160
jumanji character after you can you guys read that clock from here uh yeah sixteen forty four oh it's

01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:20.960
a sixty four and forty i i i isn't accurate that's a blue blur to me is that you guys have contacts

01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:26.560
or i'm physically wearing glasses i have wool fissions my eyes are going bad fast you should

01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:32.960
get hit in the eye with the laser that's pretty crazy man just kind of i'm gonna i you know this

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:38.800
is actually the last time our our listeners and viewers will uh be in contact with me before i'm

01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:46.720
forty five when exactly is the big day which is exactly half of my life uh because i'm definitely

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:51.600
the kind of guy that lives to ninety after christmas um any plans after new year's one or two

01:43:51.600 --> 01:44:00.160
i'm a retire at forty seven uh i uh like a boss man i mean what's your eyes are just they can't

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:05.520
even see clocks you should just eat a bullet no you got glasses you're gonna love glasses

01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:11.040
i have glasses they're dumb i just like it's just i'm just saying like god has a plan you know

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:14.880
like like it's like here's your eyes and you're like okay how long do these last

01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:22.800
45 years is the answer like like like oh well what can't you see well when the answer is like

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:27.920
how many fingers is your fellow caveman holding up like from 50 yards big deal what's your caveman

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:31.600
got that's so important that you need to count on his fingers but when the answer is a clock what

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:36.400
time is it what what's your what's your flight number you know the airport it's like you know

01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:40.800
you're like i don't know i can't i gotta pull out these fucking telescopes and put them on my face

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:46.400
and just let this tiger eat you but is it though is it that though or is it the magnification

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:50.160
so we have to deal with where you're like one at one minute looking at your phone like this

01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:53.760
you know maybe we're fucking up our eyes more screen and then you're there i think forcing

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:59.200
your retinosis to kind of like contraction like that it would be crazy if we hadn't had a huge yeah

01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:05.200
if technology of screen culture didn't it wasn't fucking with her i our screens are too bright

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:09.600
is the newest one that we should all have our laptops i that's the that sounds like the

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:16.080
whitest fucking bullshit like my screen's too bright give me a new screen janice it's too bright

01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:24.160
but brandon brought it up i do know janice though but it just sounds like he did nail that part

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:29.840
like what i mean even if the screens are too bright like who can make that like their main

01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:33.680
because there's gotta be a person who's like i'm it's i'm gonna be the screen brightness person

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:37.680
have you ever thought about telling your kids about the future i mean you could tell your kids

01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:42.240
don't have your screen so bright i want to know since you do a christmas and a birthday

antlers fine minecraft no but i'm not i don't want to have a minecraft themed birthday party

01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:49.760
that's like a six-year-old's that's like not i like i enjoy playing minecraft because i don't

01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:55.040
want to be around people and i want to have a sense of order in my life what if we did it this is

01:50:55.040 --> 01:51:01.360
your life sort of thing well we did a rope for my 30th birthday we did a roast it was real and

01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:05.280
i was just recalling that the other day with uh jeff and it was really funny because it was like

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:11.920
literally like the dais for the roast was more the twice as much as the people in the audience

01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:18.240
because the point wasn't to do it as a performance we just wanted to do a roast kind of thing and we

01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:22.720
just all kind of roasted each other in the back room of this restaurant and it was just us at

01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:27.040
a long table laughing as if there was an audience there and there really wasn't and that was pretty

01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:34.640
fun uh and it was also mean but whatever we called each other drunk and old and gay and whatever

01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:42.480
um but but uh yeah so what what did you say that reminded me of that like uh this is your life

01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:46.560
all right right like a like a performance like a your special attention thing

01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:52.560
erin migathi did like the probably the coolest birthday thing where because she and it was just

01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:58.720
like you can't really top that she took all of the she published a book and then had a book

01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:08.320
like reading with all all of my friends and like vet nicole brown reading passages from my book and

01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:13.520
then like other you know everyone that i'd worked with like coming up and reading like that was

01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:20.000
pretty that was like a narcissistic philly cheesesteak it was just like i was sick of myself two hours

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.840
later and it was like an amazing feeling like i didn't know i could get that full of myself and

01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:30.000
like burp and fall asleep i was there that that was pretty special and as such i kind of don't need

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:35.680
that i don't really i don't really fantasize about that anymore like yeah i think it's like it's

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:40.960
sort of like i i want what do i what do i really want what would like a fantasy be even if that's

01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:47.200
to be left completely alone on your birthday because that that is also a way to celebrate it

01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:53.440
rocket chews rocket chews now yeah i mean i just i just go up in the air and then i'd want to come

01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:59.600
down i i i i i i i mean i'd like i'd like to it would be great to have a big party at my house but

01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:06.320
like it it my hat might finish your house just all this shit there's holes in the stairs where the

01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:12.080
dog ate all the shit and it's a dog ate the curtains and so it's like yeah i would i would love to have

01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:16.480
my house be functional and have people come over and have the whole house filled with people and

01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:21.920
i'd love to walk around and say could i get you another drink and and and and have like a proper

01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:27.600
party at my house yeah but it's yeah adults only yeah do one of those things like a dinner party

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:32.560
no i'd like there to be some some some kids that's what a couple kids i'm joking i'm joking i'm not

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:36.960
yeah i am too i'm not a pedophile although i would i did want to talk about that for a while but

01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:42.400
let's do we got time we got the we got the blur the blur the blur right here's the thing roy more

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:46.240
is not a pedophile he's a he's attracted to pubescent girls that makes him a worse person

01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:52.720
because it means he has uh he's putting his own lack of impulse control above the law and uh uh

01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:56.880
i know we don't like pedophiles because they have uncontrollable compulsions usually brought on by

01:53:56.880 --> 01:54:02.240
child abuse that uh the victims are the most innocent people in the world and so the crimes

01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:06.720
are the worst that you could imagine but when you we we keep calling this guy a pedophile

01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:11.520
but i just i just every time i want i want to go like he's not really a pedophile he's worse

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:18.160
he's worse than a pedophile he's a guy that what that that is like oh she's 14 i'd hit that she's

01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:23.840
she can't defend herself she her life is going to be ruined um i'm making that decision i could

01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:29.040
i could i we all have to take shits and we do it in a toilet like we have laws that say well

01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:33.200
they gotta be 18 because then at least they have a little bit of a chance to not be permanently

01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:38.640
scarred if you drive by them on the street and go like why not like and he was like a guy that was

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.240
like a district attorney and was going like why not i could get away with it i could get away with

01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:49.120
it it's like that's a in a crazy alternate universe where we found out that a politician was a pedophile

01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:54.080
it might be an opportunity to be like okay you probably shouldn't run for office um but let's

01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:58.000
help you like like thank you for that legislation that you did that's so great before we found out

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.760
you were a pedophile now now you thank you for raising pedophile awareness go in this place in

01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:05.600
this treatment program for pedophiles this is a guy who's like a sociopath you know it's like a

01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:10.160
criminal it's a person that was just like like an arch criminal like there's an important distinction

01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:16.080
there anyways it's it's hard to go to you always you want to like you want to go like well technically

01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:21.280
he's not you then you like end up in this conversation where they're like go go on tell us about

01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:26.320
how pedophiles are really important like a really important demographic that need to be

01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:32.160
given a shout out like i there's not a lot of products exclusively for them did you see did

01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:37.520
you see that documentary pervert park no no everyone should watch that because i know it's

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:41.840
like watch it on christmas with your family pedophilia is obviously and understandably

01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:51.440
our culture's bedrock it's you can't you can't get worse than that but it's a condition and then

01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:57.200
when you watch this documentary pervert park you it'll make you understand not in a preachy way

01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:01.680
but by testimony of all these people that live in this trailer park of all these sex offenders

01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:07.280
that they can't live anywhere else and it's run by a sex offender and it's like every single one

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:12.960
of their stories they're not they're not heroes they're not but every single one of their stories

01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:20.400
involves getting abused yes and so it's like here we are in this society where we go oh it's like

01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:26.320
you got abused so you're probably going to abuse somebody or you abuse somebody you probably got

01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:32.480
abused and we that's a definitely a capitalism thing like we don't put money no you can't get

01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:39.920
votes by saying let alone campaign money by saying i would like to pump some some financing into this

01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:46.560
pedophile cycle well uh this person uh molested this child which means there's an opportunity

01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:52.320
to break a cycle here either with their child or with them like if you if you elect me your congressman

01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:57.120
i'll make sure that money goes to the right place like and as a result that's what you know like so

01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:04.960
then you have this that's what brought down john carrey's campaign it yeah he did it it

01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:09.760
does not work it is not good in the debates that and running the other way when he saw those

01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:14.080
vietnamese bullets well you know why that swift boat remember he was like turn the swift boat around

01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:22.800
and it's like yes but the you you bring up a great point about that that that roymor is because i think

01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:28.880
the thing is is by calling roymor a pedophile you're giving him stolen victim valor right we're

01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:34.240
like he didn't earn any like he doesn't have a medical excuse to be a bad person he's just a

01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:40.400
bully and an asshole your neighbor might be a pedophile and he's not running for d he wasn't

01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:46.000
da and he wasn't uh he's not running for anything unless you live right next to roymor in which case

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:53.360
don't listen to this part anyways but it's all over now but yeah pedophile was the easy word to use

01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:57.760
but it just didn't really apply and it's like weird because it's like isn't there like a little bit

01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:03.200
of residue there where you go ha found out that guy was a pedophile cost on the election you know

01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:08.880
and now it's like there's almost like a sort of residual like badness there where it's like oh if

01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:14.560
you can find evil in someone you call it out but it's like what about what about selfishness sorry

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:20.720
what are you gonna say to marge just idiocy also as well and it's just sort of like given all that

01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:29.360
and everything and jackass rides up on a horse i mean so you get to the point where it's sort of

01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:34.880
like i mean yes what you're saying is true but also the vitriol doesn't need to go away it has

01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:42.240
to just be reshaped and directed in i guess in the right shape at him again because it's that

01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:45.360
we like somebody calling somebody an asshole and then somebody coming out of the crowd and going

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:52.400
technically not a sphincter and it's like you know what i'm saying yeah yeah this dickhead in all of

01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:58.080
his whatever so either either made that directive or heard that directive and thought no this is a

01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:02.960
good idea i'm gonna ride up on a horse right after all of this and confidently slam the

01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:07.360
horse the numbers aren't good or the numbers are good right up on a horse or the numbers aren't

01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:12.240
good i'm gonna why don't you ride up on a horse and tilt it he just wanted to show 14 year old

01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:15.840
girls in alabama that they have stuff in common like they all like horses like that's what the

01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:20.640
horse thing i little pony says i should vote this way right if you run a simulator in your head

01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:25.840
where you cross threshold if the threshold if the threshold like the people that we're up against

01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:35.360
in this culture war if you imagine being one of them whereas you and i can be eroded we have

01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:41.840
that option we can drift into cynicism we can start caring less and less we can realize we

01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:47.040
never cared at all i'm not trying to say like where i'm han solo and we're in something i'm

01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:55.520
saying like we have the position that we're in allows for slow transformation from what we are to

01:59:55.520 --> 02:00:03.920
what they are they have the luxury air quotes for our listeners um of being on the side of a

02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:13.440
threshold where it's it's over man leon mcduff like like like like the you you cannot now change

02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:18.080
your mind and it's weirder than a nixon's time because now there's an internet everyone has a

02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:23.280
facebook timeline everyone it used to be the joke about the your mondale bumper sticker that was

02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:28.240
like you know you had to scrape your bumper to like erase your paper trail in nixon's time it took

02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:33.520
six years for your uncle tony to realize nixon was a piece of shit and he could spend three years

02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:38.800
three thanksgivings he could just shut his mouth during the pop the the conversation slowly get to

02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:44.480
you know what i don't like that guy he's tricky dick we have now this like up to the minute like you

02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:50.800
have to double down or release every day and if you have been doubling down for a year you are

02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:56.320
are 23 percent of the nation but depending on what polls you go by and how you compound these

02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:03.520
information we have gotten to this core you have this fucking thing where you now need to go to

02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:09.360
that rally and you need to ride up on a horse and you need to to give speeches about uh you know we

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:13.120
were in vietnam and there were shit we could have fucked a million eleven year olds and we didn't do

02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:18.480
that and and like and our lawyers are jew our accountants are jew and everyone's like waving

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:25.920
their hats in the air there's a subtext to it which is like we're too far gone stop us save us we cannot

02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:32.880
stop ourselves you won't stop shaming us if we do we cannot we have we have adopted a philosophy

02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:38.160
that says we're tired of being ashamed so when every morning when they get up and they think about

02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:44.320
what if this is the day when i changed my mind the the answer is oh and so i begin a lifetime of

02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:50.960
fucking having to think about that year i spent well that's like like like working for sauron

02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:55.440
and i'm just gonna like be the most awkward person at the office party no i have to fucking double

02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:01.520
down that's why they all get mad at starbucks cups and like these crazy you know like all of their

02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:06.320
rage gets like funneled at the weirdest things like an espn reporter said that the president

02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:11.840
like farted or something and then they're like oh we gotta get her off the tv like that's like

02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:16.960
they're it's their lives are such a contradiction that it's gonna it's gonna be incredible just to

02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:21.840
watch how they like their brains explode over the next few or how the government buildings that they

02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:26.880
blow up explode i mean we are either way some of these people are going to continue to mass shoot

02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:33.920
and fertilize bomb and and and the best we can hope for at this point my definition of utopia

02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:40.080
which is basically get me back to my white fragile mollusk shell like i in that universe

02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:44.320
they're just back in their mom's basement like polishing their jackboots and with uh

02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:49.520
with their swastika posters like covered with like duke's duke's a hazard posters you know

02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:55.040
for in case company comes over like like like it's just back to the shadows back to the shame

02:02:55.040 --> 02:03:01.440
and then what do they do down there like i don't know they fucking fester and metastasize obviously

02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:06.640
like but i don't yeah i'm all over the fucking place you got it very christmas i guess that's

02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:11.760
my point yes that is their point merry christmas we gotta go but we won't see everybody until 2018

02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:16.240
yeah cannot wait to fucking see what we all do it would be nice to have a new year's show where

02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:21.520
we could talk about the year but what have we ever done but talk about the year uh uh yeah let's

02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:27.520
it's been a rough let's have epiphanies um and we will good stuff no there is there is so much

02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:32.640
that is positive that it's 2018 right here uh there's just so much crap that happened early on

02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:36.320
and we've been talking talking talking talking talking talking talking talking talking talking

02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:41.040
all year long about this but it's it's it's right man it's ready even if even if shit doesn't hit

02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:46.560
the fan over christmas break which i was alluding to uh shit not hitting the fan over christmas

02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:54.080
break is is in itself a form of weird passive shit hitting a nascent fan um and so for sure 2018

02:03:54.080 --> 02:04:00.800
is gonna be a weird time to start together we yeah like like please if you're listening at home

02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:07.040
like like like really reinvent yourself like it's the time like don't don't just like joke about it

02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:13.680
like like it's like it's a great time to change your mind about a lot of shit without having to

02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:20.880
feel uh like you lost something or that you would you're admitting that you were ever a dick or a
