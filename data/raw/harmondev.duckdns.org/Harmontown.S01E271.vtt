net neutrality has\n\n03:58.040 --> 04:02.440\nbeen repealed which means you know I'll have some special rich persons internet\n\n04:02.440 --> 04:08.560\nwhere I only get Netflix and like poor people tracker to watch a monitor the\n\n04:08.560 --> 04:13.400\noutside of my house poor people will will also have like a poor version of\n\n04:13.400 --> 04:17.600\nNetflix where they can down they can stream like I don't know movies that\n\n04:17.600 --> 04:22.360\ndon't have like two triumphant a message in them those will be put in a\n\n04:22.360 --> 04:28.040\nspecial fast lane for rich people

will get all the movies that rich people get just\n\n04:38.120 --> 04:41.680\nno endings I really feel that net neutrality this net neutrality thing\n\n04:41.680 --> 04:47.480\neven though we don't know what it is a lot of us I understand it's like it's\n\n04:47.480 --> 04:50.800\nlike when I was a kid when people would talk about Nicaragua like all you knew\n\n04:50.800 --> 04:53.720\nwas that something bad was happening you didn't want to do the research it was\n\n04:53.720 --> 04:58.360\nhard net neutrality is like it may as well be the name of some crazy nation\n\n04:58.360 --> 05:01.920\nwhere we don't know what's going on but but but I mean I think you've probably\n\n05:01.920 --> 05:06.480\nfigured it out by now God knows all the people that supported it I could see on\n\n05:06.480 --> 05:13.240\nTwitter like had this massive rush of a week where they having just now like\n\n05:13.240 --> 05:16.520\nstarted asking each other what it was yeah because all they knew is that they\n\n05:16.520 --> 05:20.960\nthat in their opinion the bad guys liked it and now it's time to repeal it like\n\n05:20.960 --> 05:24.640\nsomeone got to these people and said it was like Obama trality or something yeah\n\n05:24.640 --> 05:29.720\nand so and so you could see them all looking it up and going huh and then\n\n05:29.720 --> 05:34.360\nlike like like their big insults were like like I just like to see some of\n\n05:34.360 --> 05:38.200\nthese people explain this shit that are complaining it's like a nice try no one's\n\n05:38.200 --> 05:42.280\ndoing your homework for you fucking greasy fuckface it's also super easy to\n\n05:42.280 --> 05:46.480\nexplain the people who brought us ATMs now want to charge us for ATMs yeah the\n\n05:46.480 --> 05:51.720\nsame old argument the agency that we created because we once thought the\n\n05:51.720 --> 05:56.320\nradio waves might run out who and then stuck around because once you create a\n\n05:56.320 --> 05:59.520\ngovernment agency you just don't get rid of it you never have a meeting ago we\n\n05:59.520 --> 06:03.080\ndon't need no ATF anymore what are we doing we love alcohol to back on fire\n\n06:03.080 --> 06:07.920\narms let's just get rid of them these agencies just hang around and if you're\n\n06:07.920 --> 06:12.280\nthe FCC you just hang around and now yeah we so we started using them to at\n\n06:12.280 --> 06:17.800\nleast enforce the concept of neutrality which much as Thomas Jefferson said\n\n06:17.800 --> 06:20.440\nabout freedom of speech when I think he was one of the people that was like\n\n06:20.440 --> 06:23.160\nmaybe we shouldn't put this in this document because then it becomes a\n\n06:23.160 --> 06:28.400\nlegal matter and free speech is gonna only get less free if lawyers start\n\n06:28.400 --> 06:32.520\narguing about it but anyways we put you know the FCC in charge so here's your\n\n06:32.520 --> 06:37.160\njob stand there and say there's net neutrality that's your new job you know\n\n06:37.160 --> 06:40.920\nyou don't have to care if there's tits or F words anymore you can just stand\n\n06:40.920 --> 06:47.600\nthere and say there needs to be net neutrality okay and so now we had them\n\n06:47.600 --> 06:53.800\nstop standing there and now they're happy because now you can now it's just\n\n06:53.800 --> 06:58.040\nthe internet is no is now private property all of us are trespassing on it\n\n06:58.040 --> 07:02.320\nlike we're all gonna be traveling at speeds that are able to be throttled by\n\n07:02.320 --> 07:06.400\nthe monopolies that control your access to the internet probably my audience is\n\n07:06.400 --> 07:12.400\nnot only aware of this but actually very annoyed with my ignorance of it we\n\n07:12.400 --> 07:18.160\ntalked about it in the past and you also railed against the the marketing flaw\n\n07:18.160 --> 07:22.720\nof the name net neutrality and you brought up the ultimate suggestion that\n\n07:22.720 --> 07:27.320\nshould have been and maybe would have swung everything suggestion that they\n\n07:27.320 --> 07:33.840\nshould change the name to I think but fun it's a more positive name than that\n\n07:33.840 --> 07:37.800\nneutrality but fun might have worked but here's the thing I it's just such an\n\n07:37.800 --> 07:43.040\nassault it's at this point it's like it the it's not as if there wasn't a chance\n\n07:43.040 --> 07:46.960\nfor the Democratic will of the people to be known it was absolutely known\n\n07:46.960 --> 07:54.600\nregistered measured it was there we know that the country did not want this only\n\n07:54.600 --> 07:59.960\nsome rubes who thought for a for a for a busy work week because they only read\n\n07:59.960 --> 08:05.880\nNazi zines thought that maybe it had that they didn't want it they'll we a\n\n08:05.880 --> 08:11.960\nvast vast majority of everybody even the people who only could bother to care a\n\n08:11.960 --> 08:16.520\nlittle better like yeah that sounds like a dumb thing to lose and they didn't\n\n08:16.520 --> 08:21.360\ngive a fuck they it's like we are definitely at this point and I think\n\n08:21.360 --> 08:24.920\nthere's one step left which is this horrible Christmas rumor which is that\n\n08:24.920 --> 08:30.400\nwhat well there's just rumor that I retweeted this everyone's gearing up\n\n08:30.400 --> 08:37.280\nbecause for the for the Saturday Night Massacre part two which is the rumor\n\n08:37.280 --> 08:43.680\nthat Trump is gonna fire Mueller over Christmas yeah no but yeah I hear you\n\n08:43.680 --> 08:47.080\nI've heard that rumor all right let's talk about black people in Alabama let's\n\n08:47.080 --> 08:49.520\nwhat do you think what are the odds on this and what are you what is your plan\n\n08:49.520 --> 08:52.640\nbecause you didn't have a handgun I don't have a fucking plan you have a gun I\n\n08:52.640 --> 08:56.800\nhave one plan which is the move on dot whatever plan that I retweeted which is\n\n08:56.800 --> 09:01.160\nlike you RSVP to a thing that says they can text you and with so that within\n\n09:01.160 --> 09:05.700\n24 hours of Miller getting fired we're all gonna you know just flood the\n\n09:05.700 --> 09:14.920\nstreets that are you shaking your head it's a bad plan I suggest we all light a\n\n09:14.920 --> 09:18.400\ncigarette and take it up the butt one more time not to take it up the butt is\n\n09:18.400 --> 09:23.400\na bad thing only if it's against your choice if he fires Miller you think we\n\n09:23.400 --> 09:29.000\nshould get used to it what listen you're so cynical I'm not I'm not I'm just gonna\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:33.760\nbe honest I'm gonna say we blew it a long time ago this is like if our father\n\n09:33.760 --> 09:39.360\nwho left our mother comes back drunk on Easter are we gonna celebrate no we know\n\n09:39.360 --> 09:44.080\nwhere we are that motherfucking don't love us that's how it is we are in such\n\n09:44.080 --> 09:48.040\ntrouble this is about rule of law that would be this it's about what you gonna\n\n09:48.040 --> 09:52.120\ndo it's about slap his hand when he reaches out for the applesauce is he\n\n09:52.120 --> 09:56.680\ncan't he cannot be passed there's it's like it's gonna be it's the last rule\n\n09:56.680 --> 10:00.920\nthat he will have to break if he wants to know he has permission to break all\n\n10:00.920 --> 10:05.920\nrules forever I mean I know we've all had a lot of final lines drawn in our\n\n10:05.920 --> 10:11.440\npersonal sands and things but I it is like I mean this is the second fucking\n\n10:11.440 --> 10:16.160\nguy that's an independent person that's trying to hold to just bring this\n\n10:16.160 --> 10:23.320\ninvestigation into the goddamn station any president should be absolutely\n\n10:23.320 --> 10:30.360\nwilling to watch it play out and it's it's obscenely almost funny how little\n\n10:30.360 --> 10:36.360\nfault can be found with this particular guy and if he if he if this if this\n\n10:36.360 --> 10:42.960\nautocrat fires him over Christmas break that is him saying I would that's like a\n\n10:42.960 --> 10:49.840\nkid like taking his dick out and putting it in his mother's face at over\n\n10:49.840 --> 10:53.360\nChristmas like while companies over so what's the mom supposed to do like you\n\n10:53.360 --> 10:57.240\nthat your advice is to say is like just why don't you just suck on it a little\n\n10:57.240 --> 11:01.600\nbit maybe you'll fall asleep no I'm saying your kid was first of all that's\n\n11:01.600 --> 11:06.480\nnot what my mother did she sent me to my room second of all I'm saying your kid\n\n11:06.480 --> 11:09.160\nwas bad before you brought him to the Christmas table and now you're gonna\n\n11:09.160 --> 11:12.240\nreprimand him in front of us and scar off fucking Christmas why are you so\n\n11:12.240 --> 11:15.120\nfatalistic now you're always the uplifting guy I'm still I'm still\n\n11:15.120 --> 11:20.080\nuplifted but I'm like this somebody been squeezing your titties this long and\n\n11:20.080 --> 11:25.240\nyou really don't say something this is a this is a this is a this is a privileged\n\n11:25.240 --> 11:29.800\nthing right this is like a welcome to the party white boy thing I'm I'm just\n\n11:29.800 --> 11:32.640\nvery honestly telling you that we don't have a leg that we're not on the gun\n\n11:32.640 --> 11:36.240\nside though what you would want is for the militia people to do something but\n\n11:36.240 --> 11:40.000\nthey're not they're on his side so as liberals if they if they do something\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:44.120\nelse to us there's really let's be honest we don't have the votes to impeach\n\n11:44.120 --> 11:48.360\nwe're just not getting Congress back we can't really fuck with this dude yeah\n\n11:48.360 --> 11:53.600\nbut don't you want to not on that level I mean it's I mean the the the like the\n\n11:53.600 --> 11:57.160\nwomen's March did accomplish something there what it didn't accomplish anything\n\n11:57.160 --> 12:02.400\nin writing it didn't accomplish any legislation it was a it with the the\n\n12:02.400 --> 12:07.080\nsheer numbers the fact that people's arms were rubbing up against glass and\n\n12:07.080 --> 12:11.240\nplaster and and and no one was fighting and the streets were clogged in every\n\n12:11.240 --> 12:16.360\nmajor city because he fucked with women and women's rights and then it was just\n\n12:16.360 --> 12:20.920\nlike bomb and then since then it's been like let's try that again and everyone's\n\n12:20.920 --> 12:24.960\nlike you know what I got I got work I gotta pick up my kids but you know this\n\n12:24.960 --> 12:30.680\nis this is the this is the other thing I mean like this is the thing where you\n\n12:30.680 --> 12:34.680\nwant your numbers to count where you go where you want somebody to know I would\n\n12:34.680 --> 12:39.320\nalmost say what RSVP system because I like the idea that the news item that\n\n12:39.320 --> 12:45.480\nthat ends up back on Fox News where he can see it says you know by the way 90\n\n12:45.480 --> 12:50.000\nmillion Americans say that this is fucking it they can't handle it anymore\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:53.200\nand they're gonna actually walk out of their house not show up at their job and\n\n12:53.200 --> 12:55.800\nthey're gonna go down to City Hall and stand there and piss at a bucket and\n\n12:55.800 --> 13:00.680\ntell something changes but I don't think that that that this is it all right\n\n13:00.680 --> 13:04.960\nbecause we don't have the we still have the numbers this is but this is the guy\n\n13:04.960 --> 13:12.120\nin charge of the investigation that absolutely it is I mean in some weird\n\n13:12.120 --> 13:16.960\nuniverse which if we're if we're if we're people that observe law and order\n\n13:16.960 --> 13:21.840\nwe have to acknowledge like it's there's some weird universe where where they\n\n13:21.840 --> 13:26.280\ngo you know what this is all clean it's all fine he's perfect we looked through\n\n13:26.280 --> 13:31.640\nhis tax returns we looked through his connections financial information the\n\n13:31.640 --> 13:34.960\nfour years leading up to this whole thing and you know what there's no\n\n13:34.960 --> 13:38.880\nhanky-panky going on this is just fine then and then we all it's either that's\n\n13:38.880 --> 13:44.160\ngoing to happen or there's gonna be a fucking thing and and if and if so if\n\n13:44.160 --> 13:48.960\nthis investigation doesn't reach its conclusion we're what are we doing then\n\n13:48.960 --> 13:53.400\nwhat are you so excited to get on with then we're just defeated and hanging out\n\n13:53.400 --> 13:58.960\nand just like yeah I think they stole it from us they got it right now well we\n\n13:58.960 --> 14:03.920\nhave our streets we have each other we have ACLU we have Planned Parenthood we\n\n14:03.920 --> 14:07.680\nhave these grassroots things the political thing I don't think we have I\n\n14:07.680 --> 14:11.560\nhonestly don't know how we're gonna come back from him firing Mueller because I\n\n14:11.560 --> 14:15.960\ndon't know what we can do that's not that's not what we do it's just got to be\n\n14:15.960 --> 14:20.280\nlike a we just got to be there has to be enough of us and we got to go like this\n\n14:20.280 --> 14:24.560\nright that's the problem with I like I love being a you know liberal but it's\n\n14:24.560 --> 14:28.640\nlike when war starts we kind of are not the first people to take up arms and\n\n14:28.640 --> 14:33.960\nit's kind of hard to get motivated to fight them on that level I can fight\n\n14:33.960 --> 14:37.320\nthem on the we need to have some food drives I can fight them on the raised\n\n14:37.320 --> 14:41.440\nfunds for a family that gets burned out in the California fires but when they\n\n14:41.440 --> 14:47.080\nstart doing crazy upper-level government stuff that's not that's not where we me\n\n14:47.080 --> 14:50.720\npersonally I can't really fuck with them on that level I'm like you guys just got\n\n14:50.720 --> 14:55.960\naway with a heist and I honestly can't even correct that heist you know I'm\n\n14:55.960 --> 14:59.680\nsaying yeah yeah it'd be like honestly if they were like we're raising interest\n\n14:59.680 --> 15:04.400\nrates well I'm going I RSVP they got my number and here's the thing that I want\n\n15:04.400 --> 15:08.080\nto say about these marches because you asked what did the women's march do and\n\n15:08.080 --> 15:12.040\nI think that these shows a force whatever we show up in large numbers it\n\n15:12.040 --> 15:15.120\nlets people know next time they'll be more of us and they'll be more of us\n\n15:15.120 --> 15:18.280\nwill be more of us and we also get to look at each other and say I'm with you\n\n15:18.280 --> 15:23.360\nI got your back I'm with you so it works all right but when those marches wind up\n\n15:23.360 --> 15:27.360\nin the places where people are disenfranchised then I'll know that\n\n15:27.360 --> 15:31.600\nwe're not playing around like when you do a women's march that actually winds up\n\n15:31.600 --> 15:36.920\ngoing to the women's center in downtown LA and maybe helping out those bodies\n\n15:36.920 --> 15:40.280\nthose thousands of people show up week after week to keep those infrastructure\n\n15:40.280 --> 15:44.400\nup then I'll be like okay we we are doing some shit we're in trouble and we're\n\n15:44.400 --> 15:48.320\nreacting interesting in a positive way when that when they take the march all\n\n15:48.320 --> 15:52.200\nthe way to Compton instead of stopping it in the richest part of the city which\n\n15:52.200 --> 15:56.360\nis downtown LA when they march all the way to Compton and they spend money in\n\n15:56.360 --> 16:00.080\nthose stores but they they look around and they clean up those buildings they\n\n16:00.080 --> 16:03.720\npick up some trash then I'll be like okay what's in there what do they got what\n\n16:03.720 --> 16:07.160\ndo they got in the store they got good shit in those stores like a candy store\n\n16:07.160 --> 16:11.400\nyeah a candy house is there a vape is there a vape place there's all sorts of\n\n16:11.400 --> 16:15.600\nsecond-hand shit there's shops down there but there's the point is like we're\n\n16:15.600 --> 16:20.480\nstill talking shit so on this one we we can't really draw a line in the sand\n\n16:20.480 --> 16:25.560\nbecause we don't that's not how we even operate all right fine brandy now that\n\n16:25.560 --> 16:29.520\ndoesn't that doesn't mean we shouldn't be outraged it's just really what do you\n\n16:29.520 --> 16:33.120\nwhat are we supposed to do all fly to Washington DC when this happens and we\n\n16:33.120 --> 16:37.720\nshould all yeah let's do that yeah how do we all have money we don't all have\n\n16:37.720 --> 16:43.200\nthat money no but everyone who does can and hopefully that's you know enough\n\n16:43.200 --> 16:47.040\npeople to break the walls down what are we gonna do when we get there we gonna\n\n16:47.040 --> 16:51.160\nwe're gonna raise money for poor people no we're gonna throw ourselves violently\n\n16:51.160 --> 16:55.600\nat the walls of the White House until our bodies have to be removed from the\n\n16:55.600 --> 17:02.040\ncapital can we instead of maybe going to them take ourselves away from the\n\n17:02.040 --> 17:07.320\ninternet we can we maybe tell these motherfuckers what we expect it to be so\n\n17:07.320 --> 17:11.960\nthey give us shit like hybrid cars like solar panels can we teach industry how\n\n17:11.960 --> 17:17.320\nto listen to us when we say we don't want to throttle why are we even using our\n\n17:17.320 --> 17:20.040\ngovernment to talk to these motherfuckers when quite honestly as a consumer can't\n\n17:20.040 --> 17:24.080\nwe just tell them we don't want that shit well they're monopoly they have\n\n17:24.080 --> 17:28.920\nmore awarded monopolies but what then why don't we take a couple months off and\n\n17:28.920 --> 17:32.880\nhit their bottom line all right wall because that's that's way faster than\n\n17:32.880 --> 17:38.960\nCongress and that's what they respond to they stop making clear Pepsi I think\n\n17:38.960 --> 17:45.080\nthey I think I think they waited they they clear Pepsi didn't successfully wait\n\n17:45.080 --> 17:50.720\n30 years so that everyone that needed to send out their resume get get get memos\n\n17:50.720 --> 17:55.200\nfrom their boss coordinate with their babysitter get in touch with their\n\n17:55.200 --> 17:58.760\nfamily let everyone know what they're doing had to use clear Pepsi you know\n\n17:58.760 --> 18:02.440\nlike they waited till the right time like they're I don't know if I would go\n\n18:02.440 --> 18:10.520\nwe shut blockbuster down what that's cuz DVDs came out what do you mean DVDs came\n\n18:10.520 --> 18:13.960\nout because blockbuster was renting to us and we were all surrounded we were\n\n18:13.960 --> 18:17.240\ngoing to blockbuster like it was a thing the whole family right and then\n\n18:17.240 --> 18:20.600\nblockbuster was like we could just hit you for fees we don't even care if you\n\n18:20.600 --> 18:23.800\nkeep the movie rent the movie whatever we're gonna hit you for fees and then\n\n18:23.800 --> 18:28.280\nstates came out and said no fees are the are the duty of the state that's the\n\n18:28.280 --> 18:32.280\nonly thing that's only recourse we have a private entity can't collect fees or\n\n18:32.280 --> 18:36.680\nthen we're all fucked well that was before my time I think it was right so\n\n18:36.680 --> 18:41.440\nwhen you were like eight yeah so that that sort of facilitated industry to\n\n18:41.440 --> 18:44.560\nrespond in a way where you got Netflix where that motherfucker came along was\n\n18:44.560 --> 18:48.920\nlike hey you ain't got to pay fees you can keep the DVD we don't even care we\n\n18:48.920 --> 18:52.680\nwant a subscription service so I'm like we have taught corporations and\n\n18:52.680 --> 18:57.360\nindustries how we want to be treated and if they need to learn it again on this\n\n18:57.360 --> 19:02.640\nnet neutrality thing that's just the deal that's the deal when they put shitty\n\n19:02.640 --> 19:06.400\nTV on we stop watching and we went over to the internet and if they fuck the\n\n19:06.400 --> 19:09.680\ninternet up well I don't know maybe we'll go back to hanging out with each\n\n19:09.680 --> 19:14.280\nother and reading books or shit but overall they they will learn from us how\n\n19:14.280 --> 19:20.120\nwe're about to get treated all right so false alarm I came up so everything's\n\n19:20.120 --> 19:24.200\ngonna be fine because when when we finally get mistreated enough we're\n\n19:24.200 --> 19:26.960\ngonna show them what's up by going to the women's center yeah I don't think\n\n19:26.960 --> 19:31.120\nanything bad will happens when it comes out officially that it turns out you\n\n19:31.120 --> 19:35.280\ncan rig an election without consequence I think going forward it'll all be fine\n\n19:35.280 --> 19:39.120\nyeah I just want to know if anybody wants to deal on some of this delicious\n\n19:39.120 --> 19:45.440\nlead pain I got it goes great with this best I mean they fucking took huge\n\n19:45.440 --> 19:51.000\nsodas out of New York that's a possibility we can do a lot of damage\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:55.560\nthat winds up being good for ourselves you know well yeah I mean we're in\n\n19:55.560 --> 19:59.840\nCalifornia we're gonna be fine no matter what that's the thing it's not about\n\n19:59.840 --> 20:03.720\nlike our specific comfort I don't think hopefully I mean even without net\n\n20:03.720 --> 20:09.840\nneutrality like I can afford to pay for a fast lane you know but it's not that's\n\n20:09.840 --> 20:15.560\nnot what's at stake for the bigger picture right no but California is\n\n20:15.560 --> 20:19.600\nalready art we've already started to sue like immediately and I think there's ten\n\n20:19.600 --> 20:23.440\nother states it's 11 total yeah 11 states have already pushed back and said\n\n20:23.440 --> 20:26.520\nyou're not gonna be able to do this so while it is terrifying and it's not\n\n20:26.520 --> 20:33.400\nfair we do we we stand a good chance of getting our way in this deal if we fight\n\n20:33.400 --> 20:37.400\nas citizens if we keep trying to legislate our way out of these battles\n\n20:37.400 --> 20:41.520\nit's gonna get rough and well you know showing up to a thing where you sit\n\n20:41.520 --> 20:44.720\ncross-legged in the street until they mace you and drag you away and use your\n\n20:44.720 --> 20:49.720\nbody to come up the works of you that that's not legislation that's I'm\n\n20:49.720 --> 20:54.520\ntalking about these moments where and I understand what you're saying that I\n\n20:54.520 --> 20:59.160\nmean you're basically saying like yeah all the people that have lines in the\n\n20:59.160 --> 21:05.120\nsand that have to do with win an ideology has been transgressed they don't\n\n21:05.120 --> 21:08.560\ngive a fuck about the people that live 20 yards from them and they don't give a\n\n21:08.560 --> 21:11.920\nfuck about what's going on in in their real life and they could they could be\n\n21:11.920 --> 21:16.440\nlike Jim Carrey and yes man and start changing their lives completely and\n\n21:16.440 --> 21:22.400\ndisrupting everything the in their comfort zone and I eat I all of that is\n\n21:22.400 --> 21:27.560\ntrue but there's it's also really easy to get like 50 million people to just like\n\n21:27.560 --> 21:30.760\nopen their windows and say I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore\n\n21:30.760 --> 21:37.040\nand sometimes that needs to happen as well certainly but let's fight an\n\n21:37.040 --> 21:41.880\neconomic battle with economics I think that definitely we need to avail\n\n21:41.880 --> 21:47.240\nourselves more of like boycotting based tactics than we have been that's very\n\n21:47.240 --> 21:52.920\npowerful that's where the that's where the battleground has sure we now have\n\n21:52.920 --> 21:57.320\nno fucking legal recourse we net neutrality is now going to be a\n\n21:57.320 --> 22:01.560\nfinancial game it's gonna be about boycotts and all this shit but it\n\n22:01.560 --> 22:06.960\nTrump firing Mueller is like it's it's it's fucking it's a real it's a home\n\n22:06.960 --> 22:12.720\ninvasion of everyone's home from wood by one guy who's saying I don't want\n\n22:12.720 --> 22:18.240\nchecks and balances I don't want three branches I don't want any any any of the\n\n22:18.240 --> 22:24.680\nConstitution to apply to me I want to be an autocrat say nothing if that's fine\n\n22:24.680 --> 22:28.880\nand and by the way just drink your eggnog because I'm gonna do it on the\n\n22:28.880 --> 22:34.520\nfucking 22nd of December while everyone's gone like if he does that and\n\n22:34.520 --> 22:38.600\neveryone just hangs out I'm not gonna take that as a sign that we're gonna\n\n22:38.600 --> 22:42.320\nhelp the local YMCA or anything like I don't think I'm gonna take that as a\n\n22:42.320 --> 22:47.960\nsign that we've given up and so is him and whatever the fuck he's\n\n22:47.960 --> 22:52.680\nrepresenting whatever evil cloud is in his is guiding him with the power of\n\n22:52.680 --> 22:59.880\nMordor like like we we we have to it's the one thing we've been waiting for us\n\n22:59.880 --> 23:03.040\njust like would you just would you just submit to due process will you let us\n\n23:03.040 --> 23:09.480\nfrisk you you won't let you won't fucking like submit like just say I'm a\n\n23:09.480 --> 23:15.520\ncrooked person I'm a criminal I like I have my fingers and dirty pies and then\n\n23:15.520 --> 23:20.040\nsay but I'm a businessman or whatever and defend it he's been lying and fucking\n\n23:20.040 --> 23:26.440\nputting it off for so long and try and and like I just I like all right all\n\n23:26.440 --> 23:30.080\nright well whatever we set our piece we're talking to circles yeah I'm still\n\n23:30.080 --> 23:34.360\non the uplift I just I've recognized which battle and maybe how we should fight\n\n23:34.360 --> 23:42.600\nit I recognize which battle I and I alone and all of you yeah I RSVP to that\n\n23:42.600 --> 23:46.040\nstupid thing and I'm showing up they text me they go he just fired Miller I'm\n\n23:46.040 --> 23:49.520\ngonna go like I'm not gonna I'm not going down there with a with a bat or\n\n23:49.520 --> 23:52.600\nanything I'm gonna go I'm just gonna go down there and eat some spaghetti that\n\n23:52.600 --> 23:57.200\nI bring in a thermos and and then I don't know what I don't know what to do\n\n23:57.200 --> 24:01.440\nnothing and then maybe I'm just like I'll just lay down and eat grass until I die\n\n24:01.440 --> 24:08.360\nI don't know like I just I don't want to make plans for after that day he can't\n\n24:08.360 --> 24:15.920\ndo this I know I know but we got this we still got this we got this we got this\n\n24:15.920 --> 24:21.640\nwe got this let's lighten things up a little with a visit from socialist Santa\n\n24:21.640 --> 24:36.440\nClaus socialist Santa's here Santa hello I gave my hat to someone with a\n\n24:36.440 --> 24:40.600\ncolder head oh Santa so when I needed it more\n\n24:40.600 --> 24:45.400\nsimple cool can can I talk about Robert Miller for a second yeah of course can I\n\n24:45.400 --> 24:54.800\nare you gonna take my side a little bit it doesn't sound like so I think there's\n\n24:54.800 --> 25:02.440\nanother side right I think a third side I think there's only two sides I think\n\n25:02.440 --> 25:08.360\nthere's a side that it doesn't matter that the investigation trying to pin\n\n25:08.360 --> 25:14.120\nTrump on a technicality right is what the Democrats want to do more than\n\n25:14.120 --> 25:19.520\nanything because then you look at it and you go aha I got him and now he has to\n\n25:19.520 --> 25:25.160\nresign because I got him and what Trump does is he goes no you didn't get me and\n\n25:25.160 --> 25:30.560\nand legally speaking right like no you didn't get me does not hold up in court\n\n25:30.560 --> 25:36.320\nbut when the only recourse is like being impeached by the Republicans that\n\n25:36.320 --> 25:43.240\ncontrol Congress no you didn't get me kind of wins right so we're never gonna\n\n25:43.240 --> 25:49.440\nget him on a technicality if he refuses to acknowledge the technicality is it a\n\n25:49.440 --> 25:53.720\ntechnicality to say hey Russia do you want to have a conference about rigging\n\n25:53.720 --> 25:57.920\nthis election and then Russia says here's some data you can use to rig this\n\n25:57.920 --> 26:04.080\nelection yeah cuz like we do it all the time but that's okay so then those\n\n26:04.080 --> 26:07.880\ncountries that we do that with with have every right to engage us in the court of\n\n26:07.880 --> 26:13.840\nlaw what that is is against the law and in theory that's not a technicality\n\n26:13.840 --> 26:18.160\nthat's just the law being executed what what presidential candidate before this\n\n26:18.160 --> 26:22.680\nmoment in history has ever been caught red-handed actually conspiring with the\n\n26:22.680 --> 26:29.320\nintelligence of during an election the intelligence from a foreign hostile\n\n26:29.320 --> 26:33.920\nforeign power in order to beat their domestic enemy in an election I mean\n\n26:33.920 --> 26:38.080\nthere's the story of Kissinger and Nixon during the Vietnam War the two of them\n\n26:38.080 --> 26:46.640\non Kissinger I believe was working for Johnson at the time and Nixon was a\n\n26:46.640 --> 26:50.520\ncandidate and they looked like there was going to be peace in Vietnam they were\n\n26:50.520 --> 26:55.440\ngonna sign a peace accord where it would be like hey Vietnam that war is gonna be\n\n26:55.440 --> 27:01.880\ndone and then Nixon and Kissinger kind of pulled a little fast one and caused a\n\n27:01.880 --> 27:07.320\nwhoopsy in Vietnam that made the war keep going because Nixon knew that he'd\n\n27:07.320 --> 27:13.280\nwin if his opponent didn't stop the war so the war was good for his campaign and\n\n27:13.280 --> 27:17.720\nit came out in papers later and you know cuz Nixon fucking taped everything it\n\n27:17.720 --> 27:21.080\ncame out in papers later because Nixon fucking taped everything yeah that's the\n\n27:21.080 --> 27:24.520\nthing but he didn't get away with it or rather he got away with it he didn't get\n\n27:24.520 --> 27:28.200\ncaught on this thing right because we didn't get caught because he turned\n\n27:28.200 --> 27:33.440\nhimself in so when they came to Bush with dirt he went to the FBI I mean we're\n\n27:33.440 --> 27:38.240\nbreaking elections against our own people with voter suppression and that\n\n27:38.240 --> 27:41.920\nkind of shit yes we are but yet you guys are going you guys are taking such a\n\n27:41.920 --> 27:48.840\nwide scope in order to refute a really really like specific thing here this\n\n27:48.840 --> 27:54.840\nguy is real under investigation for an actual crime to if we sit up here and\n\n27:54.840 --> 28:00.120\nread a book about from Noam Chomsky about how where America is the foremost\n\n28:00.120 --> 28:04.320\nenemy of democracy across the planet I have no argument with that but but that\n\n28:04.320 --> 28:12.000\nthis is this is a this is a politician who is basically openly making a play\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:17.520\nto change the margins ever more of politics and what's allowed including\n\n28:17.520 --> 28:22.520\nthe fact that when you are running for president in our country it's okay to\n\n28:22.520 --> 28:27.400\nengage in treasonous behavior as because the end justifies the means and\n\n28:27.400 --> 28:31.520\nonce you're in the Oval Office then you can say I don't give a shit and it'll\n\n28:31.520 --> 28:36.320\ngo around around and you guys your argument is basically it's America's\n\n28:36.320 --> 28:42.360\npoopy and and it's kind of happened before with our most horrible presidents\n\n28:42.360 --> 28:47.160\nduring our most horrible times in history therefore let's you know I know we\n\n28:47.160 --> 28:51.000\ncan care about this and hand out blankets lately I know I'm not doing\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:56.160\neither but yeah it's not that it's that I feel like once we fucked up we fucked\n\n28:56.160 --> 29:01.320\nup that that's the situation but that's that's all election systems the in or\n\n29:01.320 --> 29:05.200\nnot all that's all of our election systems if you've comes out you Reagan\n\n29:05.200 --> 29:10.560\nelection the result isn't that the the runner-up is then installed result is\n\n29:10.560 --> 29:14.480\nthat someone gets a punitive action and then those courts or those districts or\n\n29:14.480 --> 29:17.760\nsomething changes structurally generally that's what you can hope and if he\n\n29:17.760 --> 29:21.880\nhas to say no I didn't do that well we hold up an x-ray of him doing that and\n\n29:21.880 --> 29:27.160\nand it still doesn't get him thrown in jail or replaced with a with an Amazon\n\n29:27.160 --> 29:31.160\ndrone for president I it's still important an important part of the\n\n29:31.160 --> 29:36.960\nprocess to go Mikey did you is this a photo of you taking a shit in the\n\n29:36.960 --> 29:41.520\nliving room and let the little piece of shit say no it's not so everything goes\n\n29:41.520 --> 29:48.560\non the bulletin boards I can't imagine like justifying not being invested in\n\n29:48.560 --> 29:53.200\nin these in these moments I I understand the argument that if you guys were to\n\n29:53.200 --> 29:58.000\nsay this is a circus that's directing your attention and energy away from\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:02.760\nsomething I think that's true but I think it's it's a distraction that's real\n\n30:02.760 --> 30:06.240\nimportant distraction well let's let's talk about what the outcome would be right\n\n30:06.240 --> 30:11.400\nlike a potential investigation and now this is I have an opinion that I don't\n\n30:11.400 --> 30:15.840\nthink is going to be very popular but I feel like if there's going to be a\n\n30:15.840 --> 30:21.640\nRepublican president it better fucking be Donald Trump because to me I look at\n\n30:21.640 --> 30:28.640\nDonald Trump and I see 90 to 95 percent of what any Republican would do 5 to 10\n\n30:28.640 --> 30:34.640\npercent of like rancid whipped cheese filling or whatever that he brings to the\n\n30:34.640 --> 30:41.360\ntable but fundamentally he's such a gross ogre that all of the normal\n\n30:41.360 --> 30:46.280\nRepublican things that he does people are like oh this sucks and he's yeah but\n\n30:46.280 --> 30:49.920\nthe reason he's a gross ogre is because he's making an open play for a shift\n\n30:49.920 --> 30:54.240\ntoward something called autocracy instead of where we've been mired in a\n\n30:54.240 --> 30:59.160\nsort of openly hypocritical illusory form of checks and balances I mean the\n\n30:59.160 --> 31:04.200\nguys that have occupied his position maybe they're autocrats in bureaucratic\n\n31:04.200 --> 31:09.260\nclothing but they're not actually just standing up in front of Boy Scout\n\n31:09.260 --> 31:13.440\nrallies and saying I wish there was less people in Congress so I could fuck\n\n31:13.440 --> 31:19.000\nmore girls I like like he is a third-world leader who is who has risen\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:23.400\nthrough a fascist movement that has been passed you know has been provoked and\n\n31:23.400 --> 31:27.840\nmade possible through like insidious means and I'm not one of these people\n\n31:27.840 --> 31:32.640\nthat goes oh because if a Russian tweets a meme that says Pepe the Frog thinks\n\n31:32.640 --> 31:36.080\nHillary's a kind that and then when you win the election that way that that\n\n31:36.080 --> 31:38.800\nmeans they hacked the election that means we're stupid and we deserve what\n\n31:38.800 --> 31:43.560\nwe get but this guy knew about it and played ball with it and thought it was\n\n31:43.560 --> 31:48.200\nfunny and thought that it was what he deserves because he's a sociopath and a\n\n31:48.200 --> 31:53.360\n90 IQ fucking horrible monster just like the presidents that people get in the\n\n31:53.360 --> 31:56.640\ncountries where we so successfully suppress democracy that you end up with\n\n31:56.640 --> 32:01.240\na fucking animal leading the people and it's hypocritical of me so the point\n\n32:01.240 --> 32:08.080\nwhere my voice is changing but but but I I don't want to live in a country though\n\n32:08.080 --> 32:12.280\nthe kind of which we create all around the planet right well so here's the\n\n32:12.280 --> 32:15.320\nquestion right and I think it goes exactly to your point where you said\n\n32:15.320 --> 32:21.240\nthat there was sort of the autocrat in bureaucrats clothing or the plain-faced\n\n32:21.240 --> 32:26.020\nautocrat and my question to you is which one is better seeing your enemy for\n\n32:26.020 --> 32:30.240\nwho they really are or letting them hide and get away with it style-wise the\n\n32:30.240 --> 32:33.680\none's better where you can see the wolf for the wolf but we're talking about a\n\n32:33.680 --> 32:38.320\ncoup here we're talking about we're talking about people saying would it be\n\n32:38.320 --> 32:43.040\nokay America now that you're good and fat and scared and stupid and armed to\n\n32:43.040 --> 32:48.640\nthe teeth and xenophobic and unemployed and fucking confused and have all have\n\n32:48.640 --> 32:53.200\niPhones in your pockets would it be okay everyone now that most of you think\n\n32:53.200 --> 32:57.920\nthat New Year's Eve is it means that America's 2000 years old and all these\n\n32:57.920 --> 33:01.240\nthings that demoralize us when we find out how fucking stupid we all are would\n\n33:01.240 --> 33:04.080\nit be okay with you guys as long as everyone's everything's good and\n\n33:04.080 --> 33:10.520\nstupid and lazy and fearful and sad if we just shift towards the open-faced\n\n33:10.520 --> 33:14.440\nversion of the closed-faced sandwich we were already eating is that okay with\n\n33:14.440 --> 33:21.120\neverybody and you're saying yes it is because it because it's like you knew\n\n33:21.120 --> 33:26.560\nthe shit sandwich was already shit but that doesn't mean the guy saying is it\n\n33:26.560 --> 33:31.560\ncool if I just start calling it rape while I rape like saying yes doesn't\n\n33:31.560 --> 33:36.520\nmean you're protecting people it doesn't mean that your your value system is\n\n33:36.520 --> 33:40.640\nbetter it just means that you the cynicism is eaten away at you unless\n\n33:40.640 --> 33:45.000\nthere's like an alternative plan which I know that you guys are I think you guys\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:51.120\nare street level think you know act locally kind of minds that are like you\n\n33:51.120 --> 33:56.480\nknow you're more right than me I know you are but but I because we should\n\n33:56.480 --> 34:00.680\nbasically if I took the you know the the the collective of what you two are\n\n34:00.680 --> 34:05.280\nsaying I would you know it's like let's stop even glancing at People magazine\n\n34:05.280 --> 34:09.760\nwhen we check out the grocery store maybe let's try to grow our own food let's\n\n34:09.760 --> 34:13.080\ndefinitely not get on the internet tell people that want to get in touch with\n\n34:13.080 --> 34:16.240\nyou that they can put a duct tape on your driveway and you'll come down there\n\n34:16.240 --> 34:21.120\nand leave a potted plant on a tortoise and I did that one time and you won't it's so\n\n34:21.120 --> 34:27.840\nhard to book you that sounds puny that sounds like I'm I drifted into that's\n\n34:27.840 --> 34:32.120\nnot that's me riffing absurdly that's not me characterizing you guys as being\n\n34:32.120 --> 34:37.600\nludites and backwards and ineffective tortoise lovers I was just me riffing\n\n34:37.600 --> 34:40.760\nabout like like like like how do you unplug from the fucking system when\n\n34:40.760 --> 34:45.280\nit's so pervasive but like that the solution would be unplugged from the\n\n34:45.280 --> 34:49.320\nsystem and truly look at the world around you and start acting and then and\n\n34:49.320 --> 34:54.040\nand let the example that you live with your life start inspiring people to do\n\n34:54.040 --> 34:58.680\nthe same and there will probably fire will catch you know if it's if it's fire\n\n34:58.680 --> 35:02.680\nguaranteed if it's not fire worth catching fuck it then you lived your life\n\n35:02.680 --> 35:06.720\nhappy and effectively until doomsday happened and if it but if it is worth\n\n35:06.720 --> 35:11.120\ncatching it's not gonna catch by you signing into move on org and RSVPing\n\n35:11.120 --> 35:14.960\nto a thing that texts you when it's convenient to drop off the kids and show\n\n35:14.960 --> 35:22.520\nup for a sit-in I really should start a business a child watch thing for\n\n35:22.520 --> 35:25.640\nprotests right I mean that's essentially what they've created they created a\n\n35:25.640 --> 35:28.920\nthey created a list that you can RSVP to because they want you know so that we\n\n35:28.920 --> 35:36.400\ncan create a a nationwide within 24 hour rapid response however symbolic to\n\n35:36.400 --> 35:41.000\nthis event that the attempt on the enemy's part is to just let it happen\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:47.160\nand and you're you're you're nothing it's not it's invisible it just happens\n\n35:47.160 --> 35:51.360\nand nothing happens because you can't do anything and we just we just we're just\n\n35:51.360 --> 35:55.120\ngirding our loins because we at least want to say called it we called this\n\n35:55.120 --> 35:58.880\nlike don't fucking do it maybe it's important at least just to take that\n\n35:58.880 --> 36:02.360\nposture and just stand over that plate of cookies and look at that little\n\n36:02.360 --> 36:06.320\nsociopath with the chocolate all over his face and the dog's leg in his back\n\n36:06.320 --> 36:10.600\npocket and go I'm watching you Toby I'm not your parent but your fucking mom\n\n36:10.600 --> 36:13.960\nshouldn't have brought you here and you're you you you watch too much\n\n36:13.960 --> 36:21.760\ntelevision or multiple choices well so I think that you you bring up a good\n\n36:21.760 --> 36:25.080\npoint like the desire the intense desire to be like you're fucking wrong\n\n36:25.080 --> 36:28.600\neverybody knows you're wrong you're a fucking asshole and and I hate you and\n\n36:28.600 --> 36:32.280\neverybody deserves to watch you fucking your pants fall down around your ankles\n\n36:32.280 --> 36:35.960\nand you don't trip and fall off a bridge we all want to see that but my thing is\n\n36:35.960 --> 36:39.920\nlike let's look at power let's look at materially how these things affect us if\n\n36:39.920 --> 36:44.360\nTrump is forced to resign and Mike Pence becomes president materially our\n\n36:44.360 --> 36:47.600\nlives aren't going to be that much different now we're not going to be\n\n36:47.600 --> 36:52.400\nbombarded by psychic hatred and grotesque awfulness from the news all the\n\n36:52.400 --> 36:57.120\ntime because Mike that sounds really really nice but wait wait like our\n\n36:57.120 --> 37:01.400\nlives are going to be different because Pence has positions that are worse than\n\n37:01.400 --> 37:04.640\nTrump's Pence does have some positions that are far worse than Trump as far as\n\n37:04.640 --> 37:08.640\nhis actual belief of his own religious elitry like leads to some really crazy\n\n37:08.640 --> 37:13.960\nshit and you saw like an AIDS breakout in Indiana which makes no sense because\n\n37:13.960 --> 37:19.320\nnobody fucks there and then that's just how bad of a governor he was says it on\n\n37:19.320 --> 37:27.680\nthe license plate yeah it is yeah we're the worst so but like materially what\n\n37:27.680 --> 37:31.600\ncan where can we we're only strong when we come together right we're only strong\n\n37:31.600 --> 37:35.560\nwhen we come together collective power like any of us individually can't do\n\n37:35.560 --> 37:39.280\nshit that's like the the net neutrality thing right and and I also disagree I\n\n37:39.280 --> 37:43.680\ndon't think we can do just like boycotts or like economically based we need to\n\n37:43.680 --> 37:48.360\nlook at how power is leveraged and how we coming together I think the women's\n\n37:48.360 --> 37:51.320\nmarch is really good because it allowed a bunch of people to come together and\n\n37:51.320 --> 37:54.960\ngo hey you want to fight for this I want to fight for this let's like get to know\n\n37:54.960 --> 37:58.560\neach other and figure this out so the next time there's a mass movement there\n\n37:58.560 --> 38:04.200\nare demands that we all agree on to raise no money did they see here's a thing\n\n38:04.200 --> 38:09.360\nhad they raised some money that day for like any female charity I might be\n\n38:09.360 --> 38:14.280\nsuper impressed but like I am impressed I'm impressed by us all showing up but\n\n38:14.280 --> 38:19.800\nI'm getting real tired of us trying to buy our way out of the shit by sending\n\n38:19.800 --> 38:23.960\nsomebody to a broken-ass Congress or to a broken political system well we know\n\n38:23.960 --> 38:29.040\ngoddamn well that if we had spent five bucks on the motherfucker next to us we\n\n38:29.040 --> 38:32.680\nwouldn't be in this situation that is at the end of the day the thing that you\n\n38:32.680 --> 38:37.160\ncan do you get as mad as you want to about court systems in Congress and the\n\n38:37.160 --> 38:40.640\npolitical sphere and the president and the fact that third-party voters did\n\n38:40.640 --> 38:44.840\nthis and the Republicans did that or you can actually reach down make sure the\n\n38:44.840 --> 38:50.040\nmotherfucker with in who's right in front of you is eating how we done that in the\n\n38:50.040 --> 38:53.720\nfirst place we wouldn't be victims but now they're trying to scare us every\n\n38:53.720 --> 38:57.360\nweek they come out with I'm moving this to Jerusalem I'm doing this shit they\n\n38:57.360 --> 38:59.360\nain't doing half the shit they telling us they're going to do and they got a\n\n38:59.360 --> 39:03.000\nscared you don't scare me by telling me you about to pull the cord on my\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:07.460\nmotherfucking internet you scare me when you're at my front door I think they\n\n39:07.460 --> 39:11.600\nwill be at our front door soon so when I look at all this internet shit I'm like\n\n39:11.600 --> 39:17.320\nyou are joking that we're upset about it FBI Russia motherfucker they killing more\n\n39:17.320 --> 39:23.000\nblack dudes every fucking month this year you talking to me about Russia y'all\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:26.840\nmotherfuckers can't even get one white dude and you killing black people\n\n39:26.840 --> 39:31.400\ninnocently and I'm supposed to be upset about Mueller I know what's coming I\n\n39:31.400 --> 39:35.600\nknow exactly what the fuck is coming and it's not gonna be internet neutrality\n\n39:35.600 --> 39:40.360\nshit it's not gonna be FBI shit but my ass is close to getting rounded the fuck\n\n39:40.360 --> 39:45.040\nup so when I look at the big picture I don't care who y'all got in the White\n\n39:45.040 --> 39:48.880\nHouse if you motherfuckers don't pull the boot off my neck and my voice just\n\n39:48.880 --> 39:57.160\ncracked plus we're all wearing ridiculous things on our heads you can see mine\n\n39:57.160 -->

get it I don't\n\n40:25.760 --> 40:30.480\nI don't I if waters it down for me to say I get it like I don't fucking get all\n\n40:30.480 --> 40:37.760\nof it I I I get that I don't get it when you talk like that I get that that\n\n40:37.760 --> 40:42.640\nthere is a bigger picture here I I always like from the very beginning like\n\n40:42.640 --> 40:47.280\nyou know the day after the election you know a huge part of the wallpaper in\n\n40:47.280 --> 40:53.120\nthis redecorated room was you know okay white people who have never complained\n\n40:53.120 --> 40:58.040\nabout anything except for maybe that Spongebob's movie wasn't had had you\n\n40:58.040 --> 41:05.400\nknow it was overtones in the second act that the frozen girls skirt was too\n\n41:05.400 --> 41:08.880\nslit when she sang actually that's an opinion of mine I think I find that a\n\n41:08.880 --> 41:14.280\nvery very disempowering film just high heels and sequins and I said let let\n\n41:14.280 --> 41:18.920\nwhat go she's let nothing go yeah she can barely walk it's freezing and the\n\n41:18.920 --> 41:23.040\nice is like everywhere how can you walk in heels like those shoes have one\n\n41:23.040 --> 41:26.640\npurpose okay to make your ass look better for me that's it you can't tell me\n\n41:26.640 --> 41:29.400\nthat you're by yourself and you're running around in those heels right let\n\n41:29.400 --> 41:32.880\nit go let it go girls put on some sensible\n\n41:32.880 --> 41:39.720\nhugs that I can really get turned on by maybe some tights yeah I did the deck is\n\n41:39.720 --> 41:45.440\nloaded so I just I just don't find high heels attractive the the alright so so\n\n41:45.440 --> 41:53.080\nso god damn it what did I do there the the it was it was always about like you\n\n41:53.080 --> 41:57.200\nknow we joked about it I mean no one was ever but it was like basically the\n\n41:57.200 --> 42:01.640\ngeneral the very very like joking way to put it was like you know what we're on\n\n42:01.640 --> 42:05.040\nthe bench at this point like you speaking on behalf of black people like\n\n42:05.040 --> 42:09.280\nlike your turn like let's see what you're gonna do if you're really that\n\n42:09.280 --> 42:14.560\nupset about this and what you're gonna do and and and it's been a year and we\n\n42:14.560 --> 42:18.880\ndon't do a lot not a lot not a lot has changed my focus say they want to do\n\n42:18.880 --> 42:22.840\nwe're like we're getting we got it we got our shorts on and it's like our you\n\n42:22.840 --> 42:26.280\ncan see the tan lines from because we've never wear shorts and then we're\n\n42:26.280 --> 42:31.480\nlike we're like we're we're obsessed with things like whistles and like we\n\n42:31.480 --> 42:36.320\ndon't we're trying to get the referee there's a lot of stretches that we\n\n42:36.320 --> 42:39.120\nhaven't played in a really long time we've been on the bench for a while\n\n42:39.120 --> 42:42.880\nand that's true it's hard to mobilize or whatever the version of the bench is the\n\n42:42.880 --> 42:46.440\nbox the fucking box where you run the game well that's what yoga is it's us\n\n42:46.440 --> 42:50.520\nstretching getting ready for the race war and it's just like constantly we're\n\n42:50.520 --> 42:54.200\njust stretching really we're gonna get we're gonna be in the right physical\n\n42:54.200 --> 42:59.760\nstature to you know fight the drones perhaps we could expound on my\n\n42:59.760 --> 43:04.960\nunfortunate professional sports metaphors for ethnic demographics but\n\n43:04.960 --> 43:11.800\nbringing up our ghost of Christmas past it's I hear it on the rooftop I hear\n\n43:11.800 --> 43:19.600\nstrange mysterious clickings and tappings could it be do more horge\n\n43:19.600 --> 43:29.160\nbrown what what's a Christmas episode he was making the clicking and tapping\n\n43:29.160 --> 43:39.960\nhi hi how are you demarche brown I'm so good to see you buddy

came out and the preparation for it started right\n\n44:20.560 --> 44:23.880\nbefore the last time that I did the show and it's probably about three and a half\n\n44:23.880 --> 44:30.800\nweeks worth of prep and then shooting the film took about a week two weeks and\n\n44:30.800 --> 44:35.800\nthen from there yeah how was it how was shooting shooting was great I feel it's\n\n44:35.800 -->

like I mean that's\n\n44:57.080 --> 45:01.960\nstarted a run of just sort of you were like well what I'm sure what you're\n\n45:01.960 --> 45:05.000\nwaiting for this place for three weeks you're like why am I good what am I what\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:10.720\nwas I doing get my Sundays back yeah yeah I mean if I took a couple breaks from\n\n45:10.720 --> 45:15.760\nthe show I'd definitely be like yeah wait well if I waited until I'm ready to do\n\n45:15.760 --> 45:20.680\nthe show so do you what the guests the last guest was somebody who was\n\n45:20.680 --> 45:26.240\nincredibly important to me in my life it was a hot cheese Norman layer it was\n\n45:26.240 --> 45:33.760\nNorman Lear that was the last guest and I wanted desperately to be called up to\n\n45:33.760 --> 45:37.320\nask to talk to him even say that or ask him questions or something like that and\n\n45:37.320 --> 45:40.160\nI didn't and I didn't get called up until like the very end I think he had just\n\n45:40.160 --> 45:45.160\nleft who was it it was Norman Lear was it really oh I got to hang out earlier in\n\n45:45.160 --> 45:50.680\na green room with him and it was like devastated I was just like geez man you\n\n45:50.680 --> 45:55.880\nwent I swarmed him and he kind of just deflected it with Jedi sensibility and\n\n45:55.880 --> 45:59.720\nstuff and it was but it was really fun and it was great to have had so it was\n\n45:59.720 --> 46:04.440\nsort of it was a high note of that year but you were it was it was it was it was\n\n46:04.440 --> 46:11.080\na wound to you that I didn't call you up or no it was just it was just a\n\n46:11.080 --> 46:15.280\ndisappointment that I didn't get up to but that's not up to you that's up to\n\n46:15.280 --> 46:18.360\nfate and stuff you were like if I can put try putting words in your mouth a\n\n46:18.360 --> 46:26.000\ncorrective wrong you you after that you were like well no why am I going if in\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:30.040\nthe best case scenario like I might not even it was just weird because there were\n\n46:30.040 --> 46:32.760\nthings he said when you first when you first brought him out and interviewed\n\n46:32.760 --> 46:36.520\nhim that echoed things I said in the first time I'd ever been on Harmon's\n\n46:36.520 --> 46:39.880\ntown about like the fact that we don't teach civics and the consequences of that\n\n46:39.880 --> 46:44.560\nare gonna kick us in the fucking butt and sure enough we got to October and we\n\n46:44.560 --> 46:48.240\ngot kicked in the butt because people thought that this vote was a rubber room\n\n46:48.240 --> 46:54.520\nand you know they could go oh well Hillary guess what we're gonna stick it\n\n46:54.520 --> 46:59.320\nto you but not voting for you and then like it was a prom prom court yeah yeah\n\n46:59.320 --> 47:02.880\nit was like some kind of weird weird-ass situation we can easily sort of jump\n\n47:02.880 --> 47:08.440\nout of but um yeah but it wasn't no it wasn't about that it was just like it\n\n47:08.440 --> 47:12.080\nwas just a fate of the day that was all I I thought it was a highlight of my year\n\n47:12.080 --> 47:17.360\nreally to have been anywhere around that guy just a favorite Norman Lear stuff\n\n47:17.360 --> 47:21.720\nbut you did mention not getting called up like hiring Paul Mooney well I didn't\n\n47:21.720 --> 47:25.360\nget caught as a writer I didn't get called up to be on the show so if in the\n\n47:25.360 --> 47:30.040\nevent of my one of my heroes being on the show if it's possible for me to be\n\n47:30.040 --> 47:35.000\nstuck in the green room yeah you I was just saying man I was but I was in the\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:40.480\nback one come on man there were no seats there were no seats and that guy fills\n\n47:40.480 --> 47:45.880\ntoo yeah and he and there was so much to say yes it's just a\n\n47:45.880 --> 47:51.640\nNorman Lear's death I like the part where I like that I echoed some of your\n\n47:51.640 --> 47:55.880\nthoughts I took that as a compliment yeah yeah it was it was important or it was\n\n47:55.880 --> 48:01.040\nan accusation of biting biting your moves you say you're you're you're like did I\n\n48:01.040 --> 48:08.000\nthe court will decide all right nothing nothing crazy nothing\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:11.120\nspecial just working my ass off and really well you take it yeah you'd\n\n48:11.120 --> 48:13.800\ntake in like breaks before and then every time you come back I go where were\n\n48:13.800 --> 48:17.480\nyou what did I do wrong and it's like the answers never you know it never\n\n48:17.480 --> 48:21.200\nsatisfies my narcissistic like map of the universe like it's some reason of\n\n48:21.200 --> 48:26.480\nyour own but this was an especially long absence so just it just got your\n\n48:26.480 --> 48:32.120\npoint was I got I mean I'm about here to be an actor and to write direct stuff\n\n48:32.120 --> 48:36.760\nand I'm just like trying to smash fill my year I mean you know me I just I feel\n\n48:36.760 --> 48:41.040\nmy year up as much as I can with as much stuff as I can and I've been working\n\n48:41.040 --> 48:45.840\nwith a director because of these I signed up much in the a so I can't say a\n\n48:45.840 --> 48:48.000\nwhole bunch of shit but there's a director whose next film was coming out\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:51.600\nhe'd won an Oscar and this is his next film and it was just sort of like\n\n48:51.600 --> 48:57.520\nworking at Ratner yeah right right it's Brian singer is a Medeo you know it's\n\n48:57.520 --> 49:02.560\nan Eddie Murphy project yeah but it was but it was just like several times over\n\n49:02.560 --> 49:06.360\nthe course of that year to try and then get his next thing into shape so they\n\n49:06.360 --> 49:10.640\ncould shoot it which they did and then the next thing was like I had that I\n\n49:10.640 --> 49:14.800\nended up working on a thing called the dress-up the dress-up gang on TBS and\n\n49:14.800 --> 49:19.200\nthat took a big chunk of time and so that's it you know that's a it's just\n\n49:19.200 --> 49:22.400\nreally I'm worn out right now at the end of the year like physically worn out\n\n49:22.400 --> 49:26.880\njust year-weary basically well maybe we could put some energy in your Christmas\n\n49:26.880 --> 49:38.000\npants with a visit from the Rudolph of the Harmontown sleigh Mr. Rob Schrab the\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:50.720\ncrazy Rob Schrab. What a crazy guy. This is Rob Schrab's 971st appearance on Harmontown. Crazy Rob Schrab.\n\n49:50.720 --> 49:55.920\nRob coming to the show. Crazy Rob Schrab. You'll remember him from Old Man Walking.\n\n49:55.920 --> 50:00.320\nCrazy Rob Schrab. Old Man Walking. He's the man that never stops.\n\n50:00.320 --> 50:07.760\nHe's a classic feature film. Crazy. How are you Rob? Hello Daniel. What have you been doing during\n\n50:07.760 --> 50:15.200\nDeMorge's absence? Why is this about me? I don't know just been kind of hanging out\n\n50:15.200 --> 50:24.880\nwatching a lot of television spend some quality time with my dog been eating\n\n50:24.880 --> 50:35.360\neating a lot of carbs white rice chips plain plain white rice plain white\n\n50:35.360 --> 50:49.600\nrice and soda. Alright Rob Schrab. Isn't that crazy? How do you make rice Rob? Isn't that\n\n50:49.600 --> 50:58.800\ncrazy? I order it from Eat24. You should really get it from Asia. I don't know\n\n50:58.800 --> 51:09.440\nwhere Eat24 gets it from. Maybe they get it from Asia. Do you share it? No you can't\n\n51:09.440 --> 51:18.960\nhave any. I ate it already. Eat24 gets it from really inhumane rice farms. Factory farms.\n\n51:18.960 --> 51:24.880\nYou don't know that. Where the rice is forced to watch itself masturbate. I heard it's not\n\n51:24.880 --> 51:30.720\ninhumane rice farms. It's literally human rice farms. Have a cookie. Are you sure that's a\n\n51:30.720 --> 51:41.600\nvegan one? Vegan. Saved your shit brother. Almost ate some cruelty. Rob how do you think\n\n51:41.600 --> 51:48.000\nthe black voters did in Alabama? I think you know something. I think they did a really good job.\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:59.440\nSo brave. They did a fantastic job. It was a big election for us. I have white people\n\n51:59.440 --> 52:03.360\nstudying black people. I'm sure black people are also studying black people too in the\n\n52:03.920 --> 52:08.480\nepilogue of the election. But it's like there's just a lot of like white voter,\n\n52:08.480 --> 52:14.080\nblack voter talk all over all of the podcasts and all of the analysis which is really interesting\n\n52:14.080 --> 52:26.400\nbecause the bad guys are there's conspiracy theories about buses of people. In case any of\n\n52:26.400 --> 52:33.200\nyou up here are black I don't see the world through that lens. What was your opinion if any\n\n52:33.200 --> 52:38.800\nspecific like about the coverage that you heard after the Alabama election like in terms of people\n\n52:38.800 --> 52:43.360\nlike I don't know telling the story like was there anything offensive about it or is it all\n\n52:43.360 --> 52:54.640\nlike? No they did it great. I was listening to Pod Save America and listening to their\n\n52:54.640 --> 52:59.280\nfacts and figures. It's just such a fascinating election because it's like you couldn't have\n\n52:59.280 --> 53:08.080\nhad any prediction about it that if you predicted that there was going to be a measurable victory\n\n53:08.080 --> 53:11.520\non either side then you would have been shocked by the fact that it was like\n\n53:11.520 --> 53:18.000\nlike fucking ping-pong ball on top of the net. If you predicted ping-pong ball on top of the net\n\n53:20.160 --> 53:25.680\nyou know how does it feel to be that right? I mean look at the president was said before that\n\n53:25.680 --> 53:35.200\nI mean you had in the first Obama election he steadily gained ground gained momentum demonstrated\n\n53:35.200 --> 53:44.400\nimpact control grace fought off Hillary even in her weird contentious sort of giving up of the\n\n53:44.400 --> 53:51.120\nnomination and then you get you get to this dismount that the Republicans said they had the election\n\n53:51.120 --> 53:56.800\nand this dismount they did where they had they revealed they theatrically revealed their vice\n\n53:56.800 --> 54:01.920\npresidential candidate Sarah Palin and gave her a week to completely fuck that up with I can see\n\n54:01.920 --> 54:10.320\nRussia etc etc etc and then the economy fell apart and that can only be blamed on the administration\n\n54:10.320 --> 54:18.080\nbefore it and he still barely if you look at those numbers barely barely barely won that election\n\n54:18.080 --> 54:25.440\nand then after four years where they didn't do anything else really to upend what the Democrats\n\n54:25.440 --> 54:33.440\nhave said in motion he's still you know I mean Romney really had to lose that last debate for\n\n54:33.440 --> 54:37.360\nthe numbers to kind of switch around the way they did at the end of that that second election but\n\n54:37.360 --> 54:42.640\nthat was all dependent on Romney really screwing that up so going into this one in and your and\n\n54:42.640 --> 54:49.840\nit's a home court I mean you're just you're in Alabama so how could that not be a ball on the\n\n54:49.840 --> 54:55.440\nnet sort of victory where you're just standing it's a net court victory was actually like the\n\n54:55.440 --> 55:01.920\ninterpretation is that the ball on the net victory is like a huge like come from behind like landslide\n\n55:01.920 --> 55:06.880\nlike mobilization effort for the for the last I didn't see it as a come from behind I mean we knew\n\n55:06.880 --> 55:12.480\neverybody was fighting for one thing in motion but but the establishment that they were fighting\n\n55:12.480 --> 55:17.840\nagainst was solid was brick solid and was there and there was there's no way that was going to be a\n\n55:17.840 --> 55:22.800\nblowout that was going to be as close as it was we're all it was all execution dependent everybody\n\n55:22.800 --> 55:29.120\nis over the moon happy with what happened well it's not pedophiles pedophiles are pretty upset\n\n55:29.120 --> 55:35.200\nwith what happened and we also started the drive so in the black community we'd already been familiar\n\n55:35.200 --> 55:41.440\nwith the Moore and the Jones race now for eight months a year like on all your black female friends\n\n55:41.440 --> 55:45.920\nover 50 on facebook in the states that you're not even in they were like you getting out the\n\n55:45.920 --> 55:51.200\nconversation the conversations being had people were mobilizing you know months ago so even though\n\n55:51.200 --> 55:56.720\nthat media coverage just got to it right we'd already been like we were voting to save what little\n\n55:56.720 --> 56:01.200\nwe have you know what are the numbers that meant anything to me were the the actual percentage\n\n56:01.200 --> 56:07.440\npolls that were taken on key issues as voted by black women which if you look at it it was\n\n56:07.440 --> 56:11.440\nsort of like oh there's no way they're having any of this bullshit there was no equivocating on that\n\n56:11.440 --> 56:18.080\nthat was all 97 97 97 97 no yes no yes on those I keep thinking of a scenario the bigger white\n\n56:18.080 --> 56:22.640\nguilt scenario than like watching this battlefield in the middle of nowhere where there's like one\n\n56:22.640 --> 56:29.600\nguy is like I want to fuck girls little girls and then like the other side is like take that and\n\n56:29.600 --> 56:34.800\ntheir swords are like bouncing off of his pedophile armor and I'm just like watching it going like\n\n56:34.800 --> 56:40.000\nwell this is strategic for us this will eventually inconvenience how much I wipe my ass with dollar\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:45.920\nbills or but uh and then and then there's like to do to do and like like the elves and Lord of\n\n56:45.920 --> 56:51.040\nthe Rings black voters come over the hill and like and because of that we won we beat a sex\n\n56:51.040 --> 56:57.200\noffender by one percent it's like a scary moment where you're like now I'm like well we're not going\n\n56:57.200 --> 57:02.800\nto do anything for the Alabama black families I am just going to take some wild guesses here I\n\n57:02.800 --> 57:11.200\ndon't think your elves I think that I have a feeling that their garbage doesn't get taken\n\n57:11.200 --> 57:16.080\nout very quickly that there that there's probably environmental like I don't know it's probably\n\n57:16.080 --> 57:21.120\nlike a shitty life that's not that's kind of a little bit disenfranchised it is that is that\n\n57:21.120 --> 57:24.400\nwhatever we don't we don't cross section of where we are right now which is to say that\n\n57:25.520 --> 57:31.280\nin stasis these numbers are daunting but in actuality if you if you if you connect a size\n\n57:31.280 --> 57:37.120\nthis thing we are moving in the right direction there's no gradient that's going to do that\n\n57:37.120 --> 57:41.680\nthat's not predictive so you kind of have to trust that that's where it's going and you guys know\n\n57:41.680 --> 57:47.120\nit's not like I don't think that this country is breeding uh rednecks\n\n57:49.280 --> 57:55.840\nat a rate that is commensurate with the way they were breeding them you know true and in the 1970s\n\n57:55.840 --> 58:00.960\nman you're like as well yeah you're in total agreement with the nazis that's a negative we're\n\n58:00.960 --> 58:06.560\ngonna breed faster they regulated the redneck breeding uh companies and now they all got to\n\n58:06.560 --> 58:14.000\nbe free range so you're getting fewer rednecks um yeah more expensive you got to pay for all\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:19.280\nthose opiates and you guys know I don't see your race when I talk to you right I don't think that\n\n58:19.280 --> 58:23.440\nyour spokesman for I'm not gonna sit here for the mammification of America black women didn't\n\n58:23.440 --> 58:28.960\nsave you we don't work for you everybody want to lean over oh black women black women 94 percent\n\n58:28.960 --> 58:32.880\nof that vote was black man but you still want to be racist even in your compliment\n\n58:35.840 --> 58:40.320\nfour percentage points and think about that I'm gonna agree with the reindeer on my left all the\n\n58:40.320 --> 58:46.480\nbrothers that wasn't incarcerated weren't ex felons we lose so much of our voting ability to begin with\n\n58:46.480 --> 58:51.840\nso for 94 percent to show up that's pretty that's pretty damn impressive trued off the rednose reindeer\n\n58:51.840 --> 58:58.000\ndude hell yeah I can only run the simulator in my head where if I was part of a group I could\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:02.960\nbarely be bothered to vote when I was like yeah so it's pretty crazy but like oh what are we\n\n59:02.960 --> 59:09.920\nfucking like it's like I'm voting for more peanuts in my shit like because technically that's nutrition\n\n59:09.920 --> 59:15.120\nlike I would be yeah all right well we can we can drop all that behind that's not it's I don't\n\n59:15.120 --> 59:19.520\nexcel when I'm talking about this stuff I just wanted to mark the the history of it uh Spencer\n\n59:19.520 --> 59:24.640\nhow are you doing are you uh don't don't take my cue oh how are you doing sorry I didn't mean\n\n59:24.640 --> 59:28.960\nto interrupt your oh I thought you were like taking a cue that I was bored with the discussion\n\n59:28.960 --> 59:34.720\nno no no I and I was I accidentally I accidentally policed you for texting during the podcast it's\n\n59:34.720 --> 59:42.880\ngreat and I feel properly policed and I'm never gonna pull no um how are you guys doing I'm doing\n\n59:42.880 --> 59:50.720\nokay uh I've just been uh I went to the Apple store to get an iPad fix oh yeah you had to get\n\n59:50.720 --> 59:55.600\nmy iPad fixed it was great because I went to get a four hour deep clean at the dentist and uh you\n\n59:55.600 --> 01:00:02.000\nguys you guys you guys talked to me about privilege uh uh listen to yeah four hour why what's that\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:09.200\nlook what's that like a four feels great what's a four hour deep cleaning what's that like I I feel\n\n01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:14.080\nlike it's a scam like the more I think about it the more it seems like you know what you need

asleep did you stay awake did you read anything I put a I put a Brian Eno song\n\n01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:13.200\nfor that was 45 minutes long on my on my iPad and you played it four times yeah did you really\n\n01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.720\nwell but until the point where the iPad fell down and the plug that it was plugged into the wall\n\n01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:25.200\nwith the little lightning cable snapped off inside the charging hole for the iPad rendering it\n\n01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:32.320\nunchargeable and tweezers oh no and when I tell you Spencer couldn't get that thing out of there\n\n01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:37.680\nhe really couldn't we were at a fucking place that has the smallest tools in the world\n\n01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:44.560\nand then you couldn't listen to your Brian Eno no he could but only for a limited time right\n\n01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:50.320\nso for a limited time only yeah so don't talk to me about privilege\n\n01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:57.600\nfor court quadrants for four hours Brian Eno I asked her mother fucker I asked her what she\n\n01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.400\nwas doing for one tool I can answer your question because there was a smell there was smoke and a\n\n01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:09.840\nsmell laser as I just said there's a laser oh shit your teeth are disinfecting just disinfecting\n\n01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:15.360\nthe gums basically it's like you know my guns are all fucking piled up and like sure filth is\n\n01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:23.280\npart of my teeth so they they had to like sandblast it and like take fishing hooks and scrape all of\n\n01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:29.600\nthe fucking brown sludge that there was a there was a there was a species of fucking amoeba in\n\n01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:35.280\nthere they discovered I guess I'm gonna make like 50 grand off of that at MIT or something\n\n01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:41.760\nthey named it after me there was like a horseshoe crab they found there was they actually found\n\n01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:47.040\nevidence that during the industrial revolution so you're saying your teeth were dirty you had some\n\n01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.200\ndirty teeth these are some dirty gums folks you had some dirty teeth there you're saying your\n\n01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.480\nteeth were dirty when there's that much I guess there's something about the distance between your\n\n01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.480\nteeth oh that shit you know so they they had a fucking sandblast my teeth it took I believe it\n\n01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:04.160\nwould take four hours it's been 44 years did you brush your teeth since I fucking brushed my\n\n01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:09.200\nteeth basically let's be honest yeah how's it feel yeah feels good feels amazing right yeah\n\n01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.720\nI'm gonna do it again it's in 44 more years okay all right that's why like Cody said you're not\n\n01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.520\ngonna brush your teeth like

I will I brush my teeth in the morning okay great end of story\n\n01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:52.720\nis it look I'm not a picture of oral health like I'm I admit it like I don't want women to see\n\n01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.600\ninside my mouth I got they would marry me if I got shot in the eye with a laser on Friday\n\n01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:05.200\nand at his dentist yeah at the dentist no because when he just walks into the dental room like\n\n01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:11.040\nyeah she was like shooting you get lasik you get some lasik not on purpose no I went to the physical\n\n01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:16.320\ntherapist and they have a laser therapy by where they strap a laser onto a part of your body and\n\n01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:22.960\nshoot it with lasers what and this is a game we played in the 80s the strap was loose and it came\n\n01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:28.880\nloose and I saw it coming loose and I saw it in the sense that it came loose and shot a laser into\n\n01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:34.880\nmy eye before I realized I should look away and not look at it and then I fixed it but I was like\n\n01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:40.000\nI don't I was so embarrassed like I didn't want to tell anyone it was like bad I mean it was like\n\n01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:45.760\nmy eye started hurting and like it was definitely like when you look at the sun or whatever and\n\n01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:51.040\nyou get like a vision splotch it was like I was like no good I was like man this would be amazing\n\n01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:56.320\nif I have to get an eye patch from this but I think I'll be okay but it was bad it was like\n\n01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:01.120\nit was hurting for about two days whoa it's fine today is this the place that cupped you\n\n01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:07.920\nno no this is a physical therapy cup to no not a cat it's just uh just uh lasers and what are\n\n01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.920\nthey usually talking about cupping like they're usually lasers to like measure your posture or\n\n01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:17.200\nno it's uh it's a it's a form of therapy they they shoot it with lasers I think the idea is\n\n01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:22.960\nit stimulates the tissue but the thing is a medical laser is a stronger laser than normal lasers\n\n01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.760\nand it was in the the medical lasers that they used to affect your tissue or the exact radiation\n\n01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:33.200\nor wavelength that's the worst for eyes so you're gonna have one whole guy yeah it's gonna be it's\n\n01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:39.920\ngonna turn green and stuff his eye if it has to save its eyes baby well it could lift a car\n\n01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:46.800\num the the I just I just don't understand lasers that hit your skin and then they're\n\n01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.080\nlike stimulating the tissue underneath it but it goes through it's nice to me though because\n\n01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:56.720\nmy friend does is what my friend does cupping and then she comes out and she goes then she shows you\n\n01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:01.200\nshows me her back or whatever and it just their rings like bruises yeah like these bruise rings\n\n01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:07.360\nat last I talk about cupping but I don't want to be cyberbullied so uh question we don't well\n\n01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:13.520\ndon't worry just just he's just trying to leave a paper trail for his is it no it's a crazy thing\n\n01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:20.480\noh did your you talked to a girl and she she got cupped so she had bruises all over oh I failed\n\n01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:24.640\nthe cup I just I don't I didn't understand I don't understand it doesn't know what it's pseudo\n\n01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:30.560\nsites cups every day of course he does yeah he was supposed to engage your lymphatic system\n\n01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:35.120\nsupposedly it sort of pulls the toxins to the surface of the skin right then your lymphatic\n\n01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:42.000\nsystem kind of gets rid of them because sounds like leeches how does a laser how does a laser I\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.760\ndon't understand that electromagnetic radiation goes through most objects generally so I think\n\n01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:52.640\nit's in a wavelength that is thin enough or wide enough to go through your tissues and doing so it's\n\n01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:58.640\nlike a low rate way microwave and so I think it just damages the muscles and then that stimulates\n\n01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:04.640\nthem enough to do regrow or whatever that's the understanding I don't know it seems like it's supposed\n\n01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:10.720\nto be kind of like yeah I don't know hmm isn't that just what walking does I think a lot of stuff\n\n01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:18.640\ndoes that it strengthens your muscles so you don't need to do lasers I mean it's physical therapy\n\n01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:24.160\nI just want to know whether or not I should get lasers on my body or I mean you can buy a laser\n\n01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:29.520\nmachine for yourself for a couple thousand dollars and do it and I think you really\n\n01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:35.600\nroid out hell yeah dude but you might go blind has anyone the laser guy already does everyone have\n\n01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.120\nthat as their identity not man I might try it out in the new year you mean like in the marvel\n\n01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:45.040\nuniverse no in the real universe all right right not in the real universe self cup yeah oh man if\n\n01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.600\nI could self cup I'd never leave the house no one has seen new star wars I know I've seen it and\n\n01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:59.520\noh no I have seen it what do you love it any cup I love it what about those porgs what about guys those\n\n01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:07.440\nporgs what about this Star Trek Quentin Tarantino movie everyone's talking about I hope there's\n\n01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:14.080\nporgs in it haven't heard of it did you know when a dog sits and does that thing with his hind legs\n\n01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:20.880\nmoving on well no it's related that's called a splute a splute wait when they lay on their belly\n\n01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:25.680\nand their legs and their back legs look like a chicken like a like a chicken on a plate blue\n\n01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:32.080\nI like it corgis I like it corgis do it it's called splitting or is it just called engaging in a\n\n01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:36.240\nsplitting around all right

I'm not I'm not any I don't judge anything at all any I'm about to turn\n\n01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:03.360\n45 and I'm I'm just I find it fascinating that Star Wars has gotten to this place where it's just\n\n01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:12.080\nlike this crazy it's gotten really popular remember when it was just this cult thing there's just a\n\n01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:20.080\nfew of us like now everybody likes Star Wars I was walking down the street and saw a little kid with\n\n01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:36.560\na Star Wars teacher done well I didn't that's not what I was saying I was just talking about how\n\n01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:41.920\nit used to be it was just a cultural like thing that just kind of had a monolithic face to it it\n\n01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.240\nwas like yeah that's the Star Wars movies they come out every six years and they they're kind of\n\n01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:50.560\nunquestionable and you can pick and moan about whether you liked Empire or Star Wars better and\n\n01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:57.040\nnow now it's just this crazy weird like Lego like universe where there's like one offs and and and\n\n01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:02.160\nguest directors and it's all called Star Wars and it's like amazing because it's the thing I gave\n\n01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.960\nthe most shit about ever and and I also have never seen a Transformers movie and there's like\n\n01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:13.120\nnine of those and I I really loved Transformers I haven't seen any Transformers movie ever no the\n\n01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.840\nnew Star Wars also I haven't seen the new one because I don't even know what you should do\n\n01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:22.880\nhonestly is see the last Transformers movie because that was the biggest piece of shit I've\n\n01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:28.960\never seen in my life I keep waiting for the last one you don't know no I'm sorry there's a dumb\n\n01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:33.440\nplan words what is your what's your the last one was amazing I make it like every summer I do a\n\n01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.600\nthing where I just go see a bad movie a week because it's you know summer's loaded with them\n\n01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.760\nand I go to I usually go to the Highland theater just because the families come and they go and\n\n01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:48.000\nthey're the most responsive audience in the world and that last Transformers movie was crazy and\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.160\nthen like right when we get to the point where are you talking about the lot what do you mean when\n\n01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.400\nyou say the last one there's one that just came out and there's this summer the one that just came\n\n01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:02.640\nout right in July or June or July it's called the Lonely Jedi what's the last Transformers movie\n\n01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:05.520\noh you're talking about the last Transformers movie I'm talking about the last Transformers\n\n01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:11.520\nokay all right yeah I haven't seen it which Transformer movie are we talking about the last one okay all\n\n01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:19.360\nright this one is just it just it's just crazy there's 9000 elements in it none of which get\n\n01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:25.440\na full complete circle you're like narrative dealing and then they just kind of mark these\n\n01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:30.720\nmoments by chaos chaos chaos and then Walbert comes in and says oh my god you guys go get over\n\n01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:37.600\nhere go see this and then they'll like cut but then then they'll then they'll cut to Anthony\n\n01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:43.040\nHopkins who just walk out of nowhere and kind of like long ago several years ago Merlin I mean\n\n01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:50.160\nthis movie opens with it opens with Merlin Merlin is riding a horse Merlin is riding a horse and\n\n01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:59.120\nhe's fucking hammered and he stops the horse and then takes a swing oh he stops the horse and he\n\n01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.240\nlooks into the camera and says I'm sozzled and then he pulls a bottle out and drinks from it\n\n01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:12.800\nand then rides up an evergreen cliff to a cave in Ireland somewhere where there is an original\n\n01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:19.200\nTransformer crashed and injured that's where it starts does he throw his bottle down like so good\n\n01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:25.120\nwait why does he break the fourth wall what's he doing because he's so sozzled the movie is\n\n01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:31.120\nbad he really looks right at the camera there's an arcade there's an arcade of trees like this\n\n01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.280\nand he's just riding down with the horse for no reason stops the horse and then you're like why\n\n01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.280\nwould you stop the horse and that's when he looks and goes I'm sozzled and then he pulls the trigger\n\n01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:43.280\nyou didn't see what's the catchphrase there was there was an all the I'm sozzled shirts in the\n\n01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.600\nsozzled and this goes on but this goes on for the whole length of the movie and then there's a\n\n01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:52.320\nthere's like a I mean there's a cold open term but I guess there's like a clothes I get an\n\n01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:58.560\nat or like an addendum at the end Schraba if you if you need to go you could go\n\n01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:08.320\nSchraba Schraba came to the podcast sick he's a little under the weather he's a little sozzled\n\n01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:15.520\nit but you can you don't have to why you gotta sit next to me\n\n01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:22.560\nuh-huh uh all right so no let's shuffle the order of I would I would I would seriously that\n\n01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:26.960\nbut also last year I looked and I have an activity we can play for Christmas yes\n\n01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:34.640\nuh so socialist Santa has brought uh some games yes some some some games yes so actually I will\n\n01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:41.520\nleave but you are well Schraba doesn't like games that's why it's not that he doesn't like Santa\n\n01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:52.880\nsocialism yeah you can come back whenever they're so good so basically what I was thinking of when\n\n01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.680\nI came up with these games is that we're all going to be with our families and talking about politics\n\n01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:03.040\nand that's going to suck and lead to a bunch of arguments and so why don't we turn it into a game\n\n01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:08.320\nokay because people love games Jimmy Fallon loves games so let's all be a little more like Jimmy\n\n01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:14.320\nFallon this holiday season yeah uh and and so uh I can get a jump on my new year's resolution\n\n01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:19.840\nyeah doing a bunch of coke and drinking a lot um so that's like well known right I don't know\n\n01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:30.000\nJimmy Fallon's a sad person anyway uh this first game we're gonna play is called pot strain or\n\n01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.320\nhorrifying government operation code name and the way this game's work the way this game works\n\n01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:43.120\nis I'm gonna name a thing and it is either a pot strain or a possible war crime and you have to\n\n01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:48.160\ntell me the difference okay and so you can get bonus points if you've actually smoked the weed\n\n01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:57.200\nin question oh that's honor system uh or if you guess what the uh operation was about okay and\n\n01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:05.680\nhere we go starting with number one Asian fantasy Asian fantasy how do we buzz in or whatever I\n\n01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:15.360\nthink you just did government incorrect damn it is a pot strain uh let's do another one all American\n\n01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:24.720\ntiger government operation that is correct this game is great it was to capture Saddam Hussein\n\n01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:30.320\nlookalikes uh which that name all American tiger totally makes sense because Saddam Hussein was\n\n01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:35.520\non the cover tiger beat uh the next way I want to know more about that operation they're trying\n\n01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:41.680\nto why were they trying to round up lookalikes of Saddam Hussein here in the states so that we could\n\n01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:49.200\ndrop them on iraq and confuse everyone please say a musical please say a musical it was a musical\n\n01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:53.040\nhoneypaw that's exactly what it was they trained them how to sing and dance and then they wanted\n\n01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:59.440\nthem to no it was to round up all his lookalikes in iraq uh to make sure that they weren't him\n\n01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:06.000\nokay you know what I mean all right so in other words if he did have 50 lookalikes deployed\n\n01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:12.720\nthen that operation that we gave a fancy name to was just really operation his operation is working\n\n01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:17.680\nyes 100% his operation there are too many guys that look like Saddam Hussein we're just playing\n\n01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:22.320\nthe captain crunch contest with him like like oh there's another one let's grab him and spend\n\n01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:28.720\ntime on this I imagine that that um that mission involved like a CIA guy going like with two Sadams\n\n01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:34.000\nand the Sadams like it can't be me I can't be the real Sadam I don't know this like this is like a\n\n01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.720\nWashington Post reporter has two of them cornered in

01:17:06.720\nwinners or losers we all get the same amount of prizes right yeah well we should all even\n\n01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:10.880\nout our points eventually like right right we didn't redistribute the points to those who\n\n01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.200\ndon't have as many 100% and I wish I'd been I would have done the same way right now is name\n\n01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:21.840\nthat because it seems dangerous before you try it but it's only uh charging at you to get a closer\n\n01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:36.320\nlook yeah all right or stamp out your campfire all right next one viking snatch government\n\n01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:42.000\noperation yeah and what do that is correct yeah and what do you think it was uh rounding up a\n\n01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:48.800\nbunch of vikings it was uh it must have been off the coast of an island uh navy navy boats would\n\n01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:58.400\ngo around the coast of cuba and um look for uh uh

have another game if you'd like to play love\n\n01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:16.240\ngames that one was fast and and fun here we go all right this game is called secret republican\n\n01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:23.120\nrape apologist or animal phobia jesus christ so here's how this game works now that a reality tv\n\n01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:32.160\nhost is president uh are the politics of our nation's most valuable resource celebs is more important\n\n01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:35.680\nthan ever because which one of them might run for president you know like any one of them could run\n\n01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:42.160\nfor president so we're vetting we are now vetting because if you are a secret republican and you\n\n01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:46.400\nrun for democratic office you're gonna get caught if you're a rape apologist you're gonna get taken\n\n01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:52.720\ndown and if you're afraid of one specific animal y'all are gonna get roasted so we're just trying to\n\n01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:59.920\nlike clear the herd for 2020 shout out to matt damon shout out matt damon uh all right so here we go\n\n01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:04.320\nagain you have to tell me if they hide the fact that they're in the gop have publicly defended\n\n01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:09.040\na rapist or have a deep-seated fear of a specific animal okay and I made a name a celebrity can I\n\n01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:15.200\nget like a little bit of like like guessing music maybe this one's gonna be tough because I think\n\n01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:25.520\nwe've all you know man I used to have the soundtrack for the price is right it was so great driving\n\n01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:30.000\naround playing that price is right music but then if you like did something wrong and you heard\n\n01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.360\nall right here we go just when you thought it was safe to guess just when you thought it was\n\n01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:48.480\nsafe to like a celebrity uh number one adam sandler adam sandler secret republican we know this\n\n01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:54.400\ncorrect um not sure anybody in this circle has raped so I don't think he's a rape apologist\n\n01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:59.120\nno it's just secret probably you're you're correct yeah and I'd also like to guess the last one what\n\n01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:05.600\nis it no no it's it's animal no I'd like to guess the last one see you know the animal\n\n01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:14.880\nrape rape republican yes you're right correct he's in the GOP okay next all right Kristen Stewart\n\n01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:21.440\nwell she's gotta have an animal phobia because everyone likes her that's correct she's afraid\n\n01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:26.640\nof horses all right Kristen Stewart's afraid of horses are scary horses are scary they will bite\n\n01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:30.960\nyou that's my favorite animal they'll they'll they could do whatever they want to anybody\n\n01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:37.360\nI

way after and on the view like maybe the view isn't the right place to talk about\n\n01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:04.800\nBill Cosby I don't think we're doing the music the way you imagined us no I think it was right\n\n01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:08.800\nthat was that was a peak that was a peak maybe the view is not the place to apologize for Bill\n\n01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:17.040\nCosby was the great climax of the game I liked how that lined up yeah I got two more let's do it\n\n01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:24.400\nKatie Holmes oh man what are the choices rape apologist secret republican or animal phobia

republican the correct answer she's afraid of raccoons it's because\n\n01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:41.360\nthey've got thumbs right they've got the little hands they look just like ours the rest of them\n\n01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:45.360\ndon't look like us there's only two kinds of people in this world uh people that are afraid of\n\n01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:52.400\nraccoons and people with a distinct raccoon wound right somewhere on their face those little\n\n01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:57.280\nfuckers are like monkeys with no conscience they're monsters they're like street

kept coming in and through our doggie door\n\n01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:16.160\neating the dog food like raccoons I've talked about this on podcast it's a when you when you\n\n01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:21.760\ndiscover a raccoon when you come upon one they they they stare you down yeah they just look at you\n\n01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:27.360\nthe skunks do that too but skunks are freezing and

here's\n\n01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:23.440\nthe thing I may be a fucking fat dumb lazy guy that hasn't studied anything since high school but\n\n01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:28.400\nhere's here's my bird's eye view based on that the last thing I remember learning is here's the\n\n01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:33.680\nfascism playbook they they have like a thing they have like a list of shit that they need to do in\n\n01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:38.160\norder to swing a country fascist and take control of it and one of the top items on the list which\n\n01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:43.600\nhas been the eternal frustration to these pricks is that because of the internet you can't do what\n\n01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:49.440\nthe first step is which is just fucking take over the media you have to be able to black it out\n\n01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:54.640\nand just like control it you got you can't have a free press and a fascist coup they don't work\n\n01:27:54.640 --> 01:28:02.080\ntogether so you know fascism like like really goes very quickly in in times when you can just go\n\n01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.880\nand fire bomb a newspaper office and they haven't been able to do that now they're fucking doing

talkies oh hmm so is that like kids walkie talkies yeah those those operate\n\n01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:24.160\non amateur radio bands but they have those privileges even though they're commercial products\n\n01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:31.760\nhow easy are those to hack uh very I think they're built with I mean it's easy to make\n\n01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:36.560\nyour own radio I think I think that's easy enough but I don't you have like enough Bitcoin\n\n01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:42.400\nwell yeah I mean these days okay enough Bitcoin there's a lot of Bitcoin and radio dude there's a\n\n01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:47.040\nlot of money are you still are you still are you still high enough that Bitcoin I think I missed\n\n01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:50.720\nthe boat I mean I don't know do you think do you think it's here to stay do you think it's\n\n01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:55.040\nit's I think it's here to stay for long enough to make money off of it I don't know it's pretty\n\n01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:59.360\nhard to sell you think the boat you missed is like buying a big chunk on the ground floor\n\n01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:04.640\nthat would make you like like yeah like wealthy five years from now ten years from now I think\n\n01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:09.920\none of your writers did something like that uh Matt roller bought a bit he bought a he bought\n\n01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:13.920\nBitcoin early I think so yeah I think he got on the ground floor a lot of people bought it but\n\n01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:19.600\nyou can't it's hard to sell yeah the game yeah but you you you you buy it you hang on yeah I mean\n\n01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:25.200\nthe game is Bitcoin only becomes valuable if everybody just decides to start using it and you\n\n01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:30.480\ncan't do that overnight so it's like yeah you're you're you're guessing that it's the cryptocurrency\n\n01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:35.840\nthat would prevail there's a lot of a lot of big ifs there it's with still a lot of challenges\n\n01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:41.840\nthat's one thing unethical unethical yeah because it keeps poor people don't really have access to\n\n01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:48.160\nBitcoin what I had a guy on my podcast and Wilson yeah this other guy I had a guy on my podcast\n\n01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:53.360\nI don't see him that way but I think I heard he was black and he I told him it was black he didn't\n\n01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:57.920\nsee it he had he had he had like he he said the same thing he said he said cryptocurrency is\n\n01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:02.080\ninherently it's just like wait are we supposed to be restart we're just we're just gonna restart\n\n01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:06.960\nthis inequality thing because black people aren't thinking about fucking Bitcoin like this is a chance\n\n01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:12.000\nto to to change something and I can't remember I don't have and so he had and then I tuned him out\n\n01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.160\nbecause I'm like this isn't for me it was an app and anyone can use it yeah got you on the ground\n\n01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:22.960\nfloor well I like I like to be special in the things I use so it's a cute concept there's a lot\n\n01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:28.240\nof histories of bubbles tulip bubbles oh yeah well it's certainly a bubble currency like 30 years\n\n01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:33.840\nago they did the fuck's a tulip bubble the first bubble ever was the price of tulips oh well\n\n01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:39.200\npeople got really into tulips in Holland and tulips like threatened to become a currency\n\n01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:44.640\nyeah well it was a currency because it was worth so much but it was crazy because it was inflation\n\n01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:49.920\njust overnight people were like paying tons of money for tulip so what happened and it was seasonal\n\n01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:56.560\nsomebody decided one day literally somebody was like tulip bulbs ain't shit excuse me I have something\n\n01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:02.800\nto say these shit so someone finally just listened so then the bubble so then the bubble burst and\n\n01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:06.560\npeople's tulips weren't worth anything anymore and then they died right like that's the other problem\n\n01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:11.840\nwith like flowers is money well I think the bulbs last a while yeah oh these are the bulbs well I\n\n01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:16.000\nrevealed my lack of flour no I thought the same thing until they were talking about is that boom\n\n01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:24.800\nChicago but cryptocurrencies are superior to all existing currencies in that they actually are\n\n01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:29.520\neven though we look at them as based on nothing they're more based on something than our current\n\n01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:35.520\ncurrencies right and you can vape them your currency has actual you can trace it to an actual\n\n01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:40.560\nsource like a federal reserve bank which then would go straight to either gold or silver they say\n\n01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:44.560\nthat they're no longer on the gold or silver the truth of the matter is you can still take a dollar\n\n01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:50.880\nand buy gold and silver and you can do that legally but you could buy do you mean go take a dollar and\n\n01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:56.240\nbuy gold and silver like you can buy a pokemon you can buy a I mean so that's just that doesn't\n\n01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:01.440\ncount as the dollar being backed by something you're just saying that the dollar is backed by the\n\n01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:05.600\nfact that everyone's using it yeah the dollar is backed on ultimately backed by faith but ultimately\n\n01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:12.640\nthe end result is gold all financial leads to gold if if that is the case then that means that bitcoin\n\n01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:17.200\nfrom the limited understanding I can I can accomplish of it I think you know bitcoin is\n\n01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:22.000\nmathematically guaranteed scarcity right so that you can you can actually control\n\n01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:29.440\nit's built on algorithms that are meant to hopefully control for its expansion right\n\n01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:35.200\nno nobody can nobody can find out by digging into the center of the earth that the core of\n\n01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:40.080\nthe earth is made of bitcoin and the market collapses right well the thing is you can steal\n\n01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:45.280\nbitcoins kind of untraceably with some ease so that's something that it has is like a disadvantage\n\n01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:49.520\nover money because I mean it's easy to steal money don't get me wrong but it's like easier to get\n\n01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:56.080\naway with stealing money uh bitcoins just puked up at my throat let's get him another cup it's\n\n01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:01.120\nthe but it's chocolate chip cookie puke it's delicious oh yeah it's that acidic yeah sugary\n\n01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:05.680\nthat's probably what it is it's a the other chocolate acid reflux or something yeah yeah\n\n01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:13.520\nmerry christmas kids i've definitely got put here's some advice from santa uh your chimney has a\n\n01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:20.320\nflu

there's no\n\n01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:14.960\nall right let's let's do we have another do we have time for one more ham question should we go ham\n\n01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:20.320\nif you find it fun i have a politics uh multiple choice question if you like one of those yeah\n\n01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:26.240\nhow many times has ted cruz made his wife come okay is the answer a yeah right\n\n01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:33.120\nb trick question she works for goldman sacks the only way that she can come is by signing\n\n01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:38.880\na predatory loan to a person of color or is the answer c on the third hottest night of the year\n\n01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:44.240\nthey kneel before the statue of ancient undersea god cropped locked and their eyes become hollow\n\n01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:49.520\nas they turn into bleak darkness which technically is an orgasm if you went to yale i have to recuse\n\n01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:54.560\nmyself from this question and he's he can't tell us why but it's because of one of those\n\n01:36:54.560 --> 01:37:05.520\nanswers for reasons i can i ds uh i support everyone's religion so i i'm gonna go a\n\n01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:13.760\na is correct yeah thank you oh shit um stump us with a ham question oh yeah no this one you might\n\n01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:19.360\nget yeah which term describes the rate at which electrical energy is used which term describes\n\n01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:26.560\nthe rate at which electrical energy is used gotta have this one voltage b current c resistance or\n\n01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:38.080\nd power the rate at which it's used is the answer currently one of the choices oh the rate at which\n\n01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:45.200\nit's used yeah and the and the it says resistance voltage voltage current resistance or power\n\n01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:52.400\nall right well it's it's it's not it's not resistance it's oh you know it's not current it's not current\n\n01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:57.440\nit's voltage voltage right i'm gonna see whatever voltage is like the no no no voltage sounds like\n\n01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:02.880\na rate well current is amperage isn't that isn't that the that's the that's that would that would be\n\n01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:09.680\nlike the the level that it's at across the the system if it's uh so the rate at which it's used\n\n01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:15.840\nokay all right i'm going voltage as well voltage because it's a measurement an index is that your\n\n01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:22.720\nguess no my guess is the right answer god shit it's power but didn't we but didn't we like lie well\n\n01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:27.920\nyou act and i really convinced in yourselves effectively did sound like we knew what we were\n\n01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:35.200\ntalking about that's a good part of testing skills that when i was five my dad had this bright idea\n\n01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:41.600\nto get become a kid i need a train set went out and bought a taiko uh god i forgot what scale but\n\n01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:48.240\nit was a monstrous ho it wasn't h o so it's not taiko man barely oh jeez no z's ho i'm gonna get\n\n01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:57.040\ninto you uh and then he so christmas day comes i open this thing here it is i want him to help\n\n01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:05.280\nme set it up and he tells me no uh we can't do it my father didn't help me set it up he said we\n\n01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:13.920\ncan't do it in this house because the voltage that we if we plug this into these walls the paint will\n\n01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:21.440\npeel and so unfortunately son this train can't he just didn't want to set it up which is why at six\n\n01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:25.200\ni set up the next train i got i set up myself i just read the insertion did myself but he like\n\n01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:31.600\nliterally lied and said the paint would peel if we tried it jeez that was your dad what was my dad\n\n01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:38.000\nso do you do what what do you love more now him or trains okay my man that's a no brainer trains\n\n01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:43.680\nwell i just well sometimes we invert that stuff so it's like your dad you're like oh you're like\n\n01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:48.240\nfuck a train and my dad's so amazing because he like because he taught me how to like build my own\n\n01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:52.800\ntrain sets and kids kids twist shit get across the street for me uh could not wait for his father to\n\n01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:57.440\nset up the track so he pulled the train out the box and broke it by playing with it on the carpet\n\n01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:05.920\nall day long like a dumbass uh my mom threw my 10th birthday cake at my father the kid across\n\n01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.840\nthe street same kid his mother would beat him with hot wheels tracks which is the darkest\n\n01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:15.360\nshit in the world to be with his with those things the plastic like loopy loop one final dude\n\n01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.920\nand if you put the connector in it then it was like a nice stinging tail at the end of it to like\n\n01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:24.400\npop it it's the worst thing you've ever seen remember that JonBenét Ramsey thing where she\n\n01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:33.360\nhad the two uh won't contact wounds on her body and they they they uh deduced that it was uh\n\n01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:41.360\nher brother must have poked her already dead body with a railroad track a piece of railroad track\n\n01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:45.760\nfrom the other room what we're saying is don't get your kids trains for christmas yeah it could\n\n01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:51.760\neither end disappointment or death and that was it for trains that was then taiko line here on\n\n01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:56.880\nbehalf of the fine folks lionel lionel actually lionel ran into trouble financial trouble and\n\n01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:03.600\nalmost failed but were saved by neil young who bought the entire company and resurrected it\n\n01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:09.360\nso i think lionel's a fine company right now wow christmas fun facts just so you know neil young\n\n01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:15.040\nneil young bought it because his son he and his son bonded through two things one was the uh the\n\n01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:21.200\nspeech synthesizer that he had that was a Kurzweil i think and then also through trains and so now\n\n01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:26.160\nhe's got on his on his on his camp he's got this thing with kids come and they ride the big scale\n\n01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:30.240\nlike the l scale or something like that lionel train and they just ride him around and they and\n\n01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:36.080\nthey help maintain him and then they also like look at the big sort of smaller ho scale displays\n\n01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:43.280\nthat he has and they and they and he helps which brings things back to alabama sweet home i heard\n\n01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:49.520\nlennard skinnered is buying a their own model train that's called fuck you neil young

the other day with uh jeff and it was really funny because it was like\n\n01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:11.920\nliterally like the dais for the roast was more the twice as much as the people in the audience\n\n01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:18.240\nbecause the point wasn't to do it as a performance we just wanted to do a roast kind of thing and we\n\n01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:22.720\njust all kind of roasted each other in the back room of this restaurant and it was just us at\n\n01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:27.040\na long table laughing as if there was an audience there and there really wasn't and that was pretty\n\n01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:34.640\nfun uh and it was also mean but whatever we called each other drunk and old and gay and whatever\n\n01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:42.480\num but but uh yeah so what what did you say that reminded me of that like uh this is your life\n\n01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:46.560\nall right right like a like a performance like a your special attention thing\n\n01:51:46.560

she published a book and then had a book\n\n01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:08.320\nlike reading with all all of my friends and like vet nicole brown reading passages from my book and\n\n01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:13.520\nthen like other you know everyone that i'd worked with like coming up and reading like that was\n\n01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:20.000\npretty that was like a narcissistic philly cheesesteak it was just like i was sick of myself two hours\n\n01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.840\nlater and it was like an amazing feeling like i didn't know i could get that full of myself and\n\n01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:30.000\nlike burp and fall asleep i was there that that was pretty special and as such i kind of don't need\n\n01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:35.680\nthat i don't really i don't really fantasize about that anymore like yeah i think it's like it's\n\n01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:40.960\nsort of like i i want what do i what do i really want what would like a fantasy be even if that's\n\n01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:47.200\nto be left completely alone on your birthday because that that is also a way to celebrate it\n\n01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:53.440\nrocket chews rocket chews now yeah i mean i just i just go

--> 01:53:36.960\nyeah i am too i'm not a pedophile although i would i did want to talk about that for a while but\n\n01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:42.400\nlet's do we got time we got the we got the blur the blur the blur right here's the thing roy more\n\n01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:46.240\nis not a pedophile he's a he's attracted to pubescent girls that makes him a worse person\n\n01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:52.720\nbecause it means he has uh he's putting his own lack of impulse control above the law and uh uh\n\n01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:56.880\ni know we don't like pedophiles because they have uncontrollable compulsions usually brought on by\n\n01:53:56.880 --> 01:54:02.240\nchild abuse that uh the victims are the most innocent people in the world and so the crimes\n\n01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:06.720\nare the worst that you could imagine but when you we we keep calling this guy a pedophile\n\n01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:11.520\nbut i just i just every time i want i want to go like he's not really a pedophile he's worse\n\n01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:18.160\nhe's worse than a pedophile he's a guy that what that that is like oh she's 14 i'd hit that she's\n\n01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:23.840\nshe can't defend herself she her life is going to be ruined um i'm making that decision i could\n\n01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:29.040\ni could i we all have to take shits and we do it in a toilet like we have laws that say well\n\n01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:33.200\nthey gotta be 18 because then at least they have a little bit of a chance to not be permanently\n\n01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:38.640\nscarred if you drive by them on the street and go like why not like and he was like a guy that was\n\n01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.240\nlike a district attorney and was going like why not i could get away with it i could get away with\n\n01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:49.120\nit it's like that's a in a crazy alternate universe where we found out that a politician was a pedophile\n\n01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:54.080\nit might be an opportunity to be like okay you probably shouldn't run for office um but let's\n\n01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:58.000\nhelp you like like thank you for that legislation that you did that's so great before we found out\n\n01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.760\nyou were a pedophile now now you thank you for raising pedophile awareness go in this place in\n\n01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:05.600\nthis treatment program for pedophiles this is a guy who's like a sociopath you know it's like a\n\n01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:10.160\ncriminal it's a person that was just like like an arch criminal like there's an important distinction\n\n01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:16.080\nthere anyways it's it's hard to go to you always you want to like you want to go like well technically\n\n01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:21.280\nhe's not you then you like end up in this conversation where they're like go go on tell us about\n\n01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:26.320\nhow pedophiles are really important like a really important demographic that need to be\n\n01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:32.160\ngiven a shout out like i there's not a lot of products exclusively for them did you see did\n\n01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:37.520\nyou see that documentary pervert park no no everyone should watch that because i know it's\n\n01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:41.840\nlike watch it on christmas with your family pedophilia is obviously and understandably\n\n01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:51.440\nour culture's bedrock it's you can't you can't get worse than that but it's a condition and then\n\n01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:57.200\nwhen you watch this documentary pervert park you it'll make you understand not in a preachy way\n\n01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:01.680\nbut by testimony of all these people that live in this trailer park of all these sex offenders\n\n01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:07.280\nthat they can't live anywhere else and it's run by a sex offender and it's like every single one\n\n01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:12.960\nof their stories they're not they're not heroes they're not but every single one of their stories\n\n01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:20.400\ninvolves getting abused yes and so it's like here we are in this society where we go oh it's like\n\n01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:26.320\nyou got abused so you're probably going to abuse somebody or you abuse somebody you probably got\n\n01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:32.480\nabused and we that's a definitely a capitalism thing like we don't put money no you can't get\n\n01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:39.920\nvotes by saying let alone campaign money by saying i would like to pump some some financing into this\n\n01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:46.560\npedophile cycle well uh this person uh molested this child which means there's an opportunity\n\n01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:52.320\nto break a cycle here either with their child or with them like if you if you elect me your congressman\n\n01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:57.120\ni'll make sure that money goes to the right place like and as a result that's what you know like so\n\n01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:04.960\nthen you have this that's what brought down john carrey's campaign it yeah he did it it\n\n01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:09.760\ndoes not work it is not good in the debates that and running the other way when he saw those\n\n01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:14.080\nvietnamese bullets well you know why that swift boat remember he was like turn the swift boat around\n\n01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:22.800\nand it's like yes but the you you bring up a great point about that that that roymor is because i think\n\n01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:28.880\nthe thing is is by calling roymor a pedophile you're giving him stolen victim valor right we're\n\n01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:34.240\nlike he didn't earn any like he doesn't have a medical excuse to be a bad person he's just a\n\n01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:40.400\nbully and an asshole your neighbor might be a pedophile and he's not running for d he wasn't\n\n01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:46.000\nda and he wasn't uh he's not running for anything unless you live right next to roymor in which case\n\n01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:53.360\ndon't listen to this part anyways but it's all over now but yeah pedophile was the easy word to use\n\n01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:57.760\nbut it just didn't really apply and it's like weird because it's like isn't there like a little bit\n\n01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:03.200\nof residue there where you go ha found out that guy was a pedophile cost on the election you know\n\n01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:08.880\nand now it's like there's almost like a sort of residual like badness there where it's like oh if\n\n01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:14.560\nyou can find evil in someone you call it out but it's like what about what about selfishness sorry\n\n01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:20.720\nwhat are you gonna say to marge just idiocy also as well and it's just sort of like given all that\n\n01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:29.360\nand everything and jackass rides up on a horse i mean so you get to the point where it's sort of\n\n01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:34.880\nlike i mean yes what you're saying is true but also the vitriol doesn't need to go away it has\n\n01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:42.240\nto just be reshaped and directed in i guess in the right shape at him again because it's that\n\n01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:45.360\nwe like somebody calling somebody an asshole and then somebody coming out of the crowd and going\n\n01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:52.400\ntechnically not a sphincter and it's like you know what i'm saying yeah yeah this dickhead in all of\n\n01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:58.080\nhis whatever so either either made that directive or heard that directive and thought no this is a\n\n01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:02.960\ngood idea i'm gonna ride up on a horse right after all of this and confidently slam the\n\n01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:07.360\nhorse the numbers aren't good or the numbers are good right up on a horse or the numbers aren't\n\n01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:12.240\ngood i'm gonna why don't you ride up on a horse and tilt it he just wanted to show 14 year old\n\n01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:15.840\ngirls in alabama that they have stuff in common like they all like horses like that's what the\n\n01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:20.640\nhorse thing i little pony says i should vote this way right if you run a simulator in your head\n\n01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:25.840\nwhere you cross threshold if the threshold if the threshold like the people that we're up against\n\n01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:35.360\nin this culture war if you imagine being one of them whereas you and i can be eroded we have\n\n01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:41.840\nthat option we can drift into cynicism we can start caring less and less we can realize we\n\n01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:47.040\nnever cared at all i'm not trying to say like where i'm han solo and we're in something i'm\n\n01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:55.520\nsaying like we have the position that we're in allows for slow transformation from what we are to\n\n01:59:55.520 --> 02:00:03.920\nwhat they are they have the luxury air quotes for our listeners um of being on the side of a\n\n02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:13.440\nthreshold where it's it's over man leon mcduff like like like like the you you cannot now change\n\n02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:18.080\nyour mind and it's weirder than a nixon's time because now there's an internet everyone has a\n\n02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:23.280\nfacebook timeline everyone it used to be the joke about the your mondale bumper sticker that was\n\n02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:28.240\nlike you know you had to scrape your bumper to like erase your paper trail in nixon's time it took\n\n02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:33.520\nsix years for your uncle tony to realize nixon was a piece of shit and he could spend three years\n\n02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:38.800\nthree thanksgivings he could just shut his mouth during the pop the the conversation slowly get to\n\n02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:44.480\nyou know what i don't like that guy he's tricky dick we have now this like up to the minute like you\n\n02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:50.800\nhave to double down or release every day and if you have been doubling down for a year you are\n\n02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:56.320\nare 23 percent of the nation but depending on what polls you go by and how you compound these\n\n02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:03.520\ninformation we have gotten to this core you have this fucking thing where you now need to go to\n\n02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:09.360\nthat rally and you need to ride up on a horse and you need to to give speeches about uh you know we\n\n02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:13.120\nwere in vietnam and there were shit we could have fucked a million eleven year olds and we didn't do\n\n02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:18.480\nthat and and like and our lawyers are jew our accountants are jew and everyone's like waving\n\n02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:25.920\ntheir hats in the air there's a subtext to it which is like we're too far gone stop us save us we cannot\n\n02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:32.880\nstop ourselves you won't stop shaming us if we do we cannot we have we have adopted a philosophy\n\n02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:38.160\nthat says we're tired of being ashamed so when every morning when they get up and they think about\n\n02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:44.320\nwhat if this is the day when i changed my mind the the answer is oh and so i begin a lifetime of\n\n02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:50.960\nfucking having to think about that year i spent well that's like like like working for sauron\n\n02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:55.440\nand i'm just gonna like be
