{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:11.000\nOh, man. Hello, everybody. Welcome. Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:11.000 --> 00:21.000\nLet's hear it. Come on. Welcome to the back of Miltdown Comics.\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:32.000\nLet's bring out Spencer. Spencer. Spencer, right here. I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Rob Schrab.\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:39.000\nI will be controlling in the place of Jeff Davis, who could not be here tonight.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:42.000\nHow y'all feeling tonight? You everybody feeling good?\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:51.000\nAlright, let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:16.000\nSit down. Sit down.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:22.000\nYay. It's 8.12.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:29.000\nI don't know. Now explain that.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:35.000\nWhen you were in the bathroom at El Compadre, Rob shot me a mischievous look.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:41.000\nI said, now, Rob, that's not a normal man's look. You've got something cooking up right in your mind right now.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:50.000\nAnd what did you say, Rob? Well, basically, just he suggested that we do what you just saw happen.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:55.000\nLike, what did you? You tweeted them?\n\n01:55.000 --> 02:02.000\nI didn't tweet shit, man. I've been on Twitter since Bill Paxton died.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:05.000\nWe lost Bill Paxton.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:09.000\nI'm really bummed out about that. Who's really bummed out about that?\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:12.000\nIt's over, man.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:15.000\nSome people make fun of it.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:16.000\nI'm pretty sad about it.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:21.000\nSame Game Over Man is definitely trivializing a human being's death, I would say.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:26.000\nI got a lot of misguided people when Harold Ramis died, like, oh, he's seeing Vinkman on the other side now.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:34.000\nIt's like, don't do the thing where you relate their death to their product.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:41.000\nI don't think. Not when you're genuinely trying to eulogize. Do it in the privacy of your own bedroom.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:44.000\nWhen did you find out?\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:46.000\nI don't know, this morning, I guess.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:57.000\nIt just hit me. It was like, one of those guys that you think is going to be around forever, and he's just gone.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:00.000\nIt's like Miguel Ferrer died earlier this year.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:09.000\nAnd we also recently lost Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:13.000\nYou don't know when it's going to happen.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:24.000\nSomebody will be complicated in surgery, somebody will dig up a year old interview where you sound a little bit like you're alright with pedophilia, and then you're just gone.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:37.000\nI want to really just congratulate Simon and Schuster. They really went on a limb there to cancel a book deal after rediscovering someone's highly publicized remarks on pedophilia.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:44.000\nI think the second time it became publicized, it was really just the right thing to do at the time.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:48.000\nOh, wait, now that's going to be unprofitable pedophilia?\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:54.000\nAll right, well, we thought it was one of those one times.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:59.000\nIt's too bad because he's such a nice, likable person.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:05.000\nWell, as he would always explain, he was just being funny.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:09.000\nHe was just very funny. He was just a very funny person, he would always say.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:15.000\nI think the funniest thing about him was how he would continually talk over anyone who'd show he was odd.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:19.000\nHe had no basic improv training. He would not give and take.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:25.000\nNo matter what show he was on, you would just be hearing him talking over anyone that was always talking.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:30.000\nNot a funny person and not a talented person, just a tragic attention whore.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:41.000\nThat's fine. The thing is, I find the irony to be, as soon as Breitbart lost him, whether he quit or got fired,\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:46.000\nand then I watched the Joe Rogan thing where he was talking about getting fucked by his priest or whatever,\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:54.000\nand it was like, I think the interesting thing about the left versus the right is that the left would like to hear about your bullshit\n\n04:54.000 --> 05:11.000\nafter we know it's related to human trauma, and the right would like to hear about it right up until that time.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:19.000\n$5 gets you the video subscription to Harmontown. See what Rob Schrab is doing.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:24.000\nI'm not going to try to do a regular show tonight.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:29.000\nIt's the Oscars. The Oscars are on right now.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:31.000\nThe Oscars are...\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:33.000\nWho's one?\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:34.000\nLala Land.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:35.000\nWho's two?\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:39.000\nSuicide Squad.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:45.000\nLala Land can suck-suck my dick-dick.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:53.000\nAnd it can, too.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:59.000\nWhat is this concoction, somebody?\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:03.000\nThat's Frank Branca. That's what Jeff user drinks.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:11.000\nI feel like reanimator, man.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:17.000\nMy thoughts on Milo are very cogent and timely, and now they're lost to the ages.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:20.000\nHow you doing, Dan? I haven't seen you in a while.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:24.000\nWe discovered some new planets, Rob.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:28.000\nOkay.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nHave they been named yet?\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:32.000\nNo.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nHow many planets?\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:35.000\nI don't know.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:36.000\nLet's name them.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:41.000\nI don't know. I don't know anything that you don't know. NASA said on Monday,\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:44.000\nwe got some shit coming out that on Wednesday, they were like,\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nhere's the thing, there's some things.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:54.000\nAll I was getting at third hand, there was a solar system that has multiple Earth-like planets.\n\n06:54.000 --> 07:01.000\nThere's seven new Earth-like exoplanets or something revolving around a single-star solar system.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:05.000\nOnly one star?\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:06.000\nImagine if these...\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:10.000\nHow many moons?\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.000\nImagine if these planets are actually...\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:17.000\nYou've got to figure, before we could ever even...\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:20.000\nBefore we had gasoline, before we had electricity, we had telescopes,\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nwe could see what was going on on the moon.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:26.000\nSo if these planets are... Let's say they all have sentient life evolving on them.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:27.000\nSure.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nWe would be making first contact with people.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:33.000\nMost importantly, even if they weren't technologically more advanced than us,\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:37.000\nthey would already be, if they had telescopic contact with each other,\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nthey would already be like the New York to our Wyoming.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:44.000\nBecause they would have grown up, like in the year 1400,\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:49.000\nthey would have known there were fish people on the planet, like a couple of...\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:53.000\nWhat if the fish people were like a hundred years behind us?\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nOr ahead of them, whatever. It doesn't matter.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:59.000\nWe will be making contact with a solar system that will be like,\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:04.000\nwhy are you people so racist?\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:09.000\nWhen we were getting to that point, we could see fish people waving at us.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:13.000\nAnd we could also see them beating up snake people next to them.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:17.000\nAnd we were monkey people next to giraffe people going like,\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:18.000\nstop doing that.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:22.000\nAnd they were like, you're right. You should stop doing that too. You're right.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:27.000\nAnd then we're going to be so intimidated by them that we're going to be like,\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:28.000\nNot me.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:32.000\nI think, I don't know, I just think it could be an ironic development\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:35.000\nwhere we're like totally technologically the same,\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:39.000\nbut they're kind of snobby, like they're more cosmopolitan.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:43.000\nAnd then we end up going like, they're looking down on us and going like,\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:44.000\nyou're still racist?\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:47.000\nAnd we'll be like, yeah, that's right.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:53.000\nI hate this Mexican guy and he hates me because we're from Earth.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:59.000\nI'm glad you let me get through the thought.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:16.000\nAll right, our guests tonight have a feral audio podcast\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\ncalled Dumb People Town.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:27.000\nLet's bring out the Sklar Brothers.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:28.000\nThank you.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:34.000\nHey, Rob, did you get that tiny bottle of table wine we sent over to you?\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:35.000\nI did.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:36.000\nOh, good.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nOh, great.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:38.000\nGreat.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nSomebody ate the tiny loaf of bread that came with it.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:41.000\nChef's choice.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nOkay.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:46.000\nSo let's get through the twin stuff for a second.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nI thought you were going to talk about...\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:49.000\nCover it finally.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nYeah, finally, let's crack that.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:53.000\nI actually want to talk just briefly about the planet stuff.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:54.000\nOkay.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:57.000\nBecause I always felt like Pluto got the rawest deal of all.\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nIt's like a planet for so...\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:02.000\nWe think we have job security problems.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:06.000\nThat shit was locked down for so long.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nThat was diorama lockdown.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:13.000\nThat was diorama lockdown to then just be like, yep, you're not a planet anymore.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nTo me, it feels like the rawest deal ever.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:16.000\nWhat is it?\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:22.000\nIt's like, my very elegant mother just served us nine...\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nDwarf planets?\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:28.000\nMy very elegant mother just served us nothing.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nThat's what it was.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:31.000\nIf you're Pluto...\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:34.000\nI thought I saw some little sniglet about maybe Pluto now.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:37.000\nIt was a planet, then it wasn't a planet, and now it might be...\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nIt was Dwarf planet for a while.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nThen it was on Game of Thrones.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:46.000\nThen now, wait, is Rich Hall still doing sniglets?\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:52.000\nI co-opted the word sniglet to mean a little thing.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nA snippet?\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:02.000\nAn unresearched bot that injured my head.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:08.000\nI thought I saw some little subhead that was always related to the NASA conference.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:14.000\nThey found all these little exoplanets, but then there was also something attached to that,\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:17.000\na rider that was like, also Pluto might be a planet.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:18.000\nP.S.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:19.000\nAm I imagining that?\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:20.000\nP.S., yeah, Pluto...\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nI know, remember how all those people said Pluto wasn't a planet?\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nIt is actually now a planet.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:25.000\nIt is again.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:28.000\nNo, I don't know if that was just an attachment on the little planet.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:29.000\nP.S.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nAll right, we want to talk about twins?\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nYeah, let's get into it.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:34.000\nLet's fucking get into it.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nBill Paxton, let's talk about Bill Paxton.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:39.000\nIs it the size or is it the distance from the sun?\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:40.000\nWhat is the issue?\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:41.000\nFor twins?\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:42.000\nI don't know.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:47.000\nHow do you get your power?\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:51.000\nWe have to say equidistant from the sun or one of us dies.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:56.000\nIt's a very difficult thing to manage when we're not together.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:59.000\nActually, I actually found out about Bill Paxton last week.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:00.000\nWhat?\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nYeah, my phone's got crazy alerts.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:03.000\nIt was unbelievable.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:07.000\nI just seen the movie Arrival, so I can actually see into the creature now.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:10.000\nSee, you're trivializing a human being's death.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:13.000\nHey, I just know I'm never getting lasik surgery.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:16.000\nThat's one thing I'll never do, because you died of complications from...\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:17.000\nNo, really?\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:18.000\nThat's what it is?\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:19.000\nFrom lasik surgery?\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.000\nNo, I made that up.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nI totally made that up.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:23.000\nWow.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:27.000\nI thought it was because your glasses are the only way we could tell you from your brother.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:30.000\nYeah, but really I have no heart.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nNo soul.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:35.000\nYeah, I was thinking I might watch a simple plan tonight.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:36.000\nYou guys like a simple...\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:37.000\nSo good.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:38.000\nSo fucking good.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nParticularly liked Bill Paxton in that movie.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:41.000\nHe was great.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nHe was great.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nAnd then Billy Bob Thornton, just nobody...\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:48.000\nHe's got the most powerful, like, quiet voice in all of movies.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:49.000\nHe just...\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:50.000\nHe says it so quietly.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:54.000\nYou ever see one false move with Bill Paxton and Billy Bob?\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:55.000\nNo, I have not.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:56.000\nReally good.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:57.000\nReally, really good.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nIt's the simple plan of movies.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.000\nNo.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:06.000\nTrying to do my Billy Bob Thornton impression.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nIt's good.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nWorking hard.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:12.000\nI like mashed potatoes.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:15.000\nWhat else do you like Billy Bob?\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:18.000\nI'm going to just start showing you objects.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nDo you like tiny wine?\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nI like tobogganing.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:25.000\nThat goes well with mashed potatoes.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:26.000\nWhat else?\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:35.000\nI like being questioned by Canadian interviewers about my band.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nWhat is he looking at?\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:39.000\nI don't know what Billy Bob is looking at.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:40.000\nI'm focusing on...\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:41.000\nJust down on the floor.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:45.000\nI have to focus all of my energy into my impersonation lobe.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:46.000\nI love it.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:50.000\nI'm not going to do a fucking awesome Billy Bob and then also be like,\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nWho wants pizza?\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:52.000\nThat's right.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:53.000\nOr make eye contact.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:56.000\nYeah, at the very least.\n\n13:56.000 --> 14:03.000\nI like mashed potatoes and gravy.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nSee, it doesn't work.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:08.000\nNo, you went from zero eye contact to the creepiest,\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:10.000\nI will never look away from you eye contact.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:13.000\nHe looked through Jason to me.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nLike that's how.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:17.000\nWould you ask Tom Petty about his influences?\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:18.000\nYes.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:19.000\nYeah, I would.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:22.000\nYou've seen that Canadian clip, right?\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.000\nYes.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:24.000\nFucking amazing.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:25.000\nThat's my favorite part.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nWould you ask Tom Petty about his influences?\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:28.000\nYeah.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:29.000\nPause, pause.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:30.000\nYeah.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:31.000\nYeah.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:32.000\nOf course.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nIt's one of the first things I asked.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:35.000\nWhat did you want to know?\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:36.000\nYeah.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nWho are you influencing?\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nThat's the first thing they cover in the Bogdanovitch thing.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:40.000\nYeah.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:43.000\nIt's a sign bar item on Wikipedia for all musicians.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:44.000\nRight.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:47.000\nIf you Wikipedia Prince, it says what his influences are.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:50.000\nWhat are Prince's influences?\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:51.000\nBilly Bob.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:52.000\nBilly Bob, what are they?\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:55.000\nBilly Bob, what are Prince's influences?\n\n14:55.000 --> 15:03.000\nOh, Prince's influences are.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.000\nOh God.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:08.000\nI'm trying to hold it.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:09.000\nCaptain EO.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:10.000\nFor sure.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.000\nFor sure.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:12.000\nDavid Bowie.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:13.000\nI feel that.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:14.000\nFeel it.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:19.000\nYou started with Captain EO and then went to David Bowie.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nIn that order.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nIn the order of most influential.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:24.000\nCaptain EO.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nCaptain EO.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nDavid Bowie.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nYeah.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:28.000\nDavid Bowie.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:32.000\nNot a close second, but definitely a second.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:35.000\nThe Muppets.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.000\nJames Brown.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:37.000\nAll right.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:38.000\nAll right.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:39.000\nTwin stuff.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:40.000\nSorry.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:41.000\nWe made you jump off the twins.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\nOh, twin stuff.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:43.000\nAll right.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:44.000\nAll right.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nSo what are you guys?\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nDo you have private time?\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nDo you go like at the end of the day?\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:48.000\nLike do you go?\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:49.000\nDo you go home?\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:50.000\nDo you live in the same house?\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:51.000\nYeah.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:55.000\nLike if one of you stubs their toe, do you the other feel it?\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:56.000\nNo, we.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:57.000\nNow come on.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nSomebody stub this guy's toe.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:00.000\nHang on a second.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nThat is an extraordinarily fair question.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:05.000\nThat is a super valid question.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:08.000\nI don't want to stomp on the validity of that question.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nI don't want to stub my toe on the validity of that question.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:13.000\nI don't stub my nose in the face of that question.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:14.000\nGood.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:15.000\nNo.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:18.000\nNo, although.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.000\nQuite simply.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:20.000\nThat is bullshit.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:21.000\nIt's such horseshit.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:24.000\nAlthough I will say this, I will say this.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:29.000\nRecently we were, we were about to go do some shows on the road.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:33.000\nAnd when we have a really early morning flight, we'll call each other in the car as we're\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:34.000\ndriving.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:40.000\nWe don't live in the same house.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:44.000\nLike we both, yeah, we, we both have two families.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:47.000\nWe live on the only caboots in LA.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:48.000\nYeah.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nIt's a communal living site.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nSo we're driving.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:54.000\nWe always, I will call him always, or he'll call me just to make sure that the other one\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nwoke up and is coming to the gig.\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:03.000\nAnd, and so he called me and I couldn't take the call because I had stopped because I had\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:06.000\nto pee so badly, like uncharacteristically so badly.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\nI had already peed in the morning.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nI was, I'd stopped at a 7-Eleven, which someone told me dummy.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nThey don't have bathrooms at 7-Eleven.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:14.000\nI didn't know that.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:17.000\nI went in and got into a fight while I had to pee with the guy.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nI was like, you have to pee somewhere.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:22.000\nLike I don't know why I got into it with him at that point.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:23.000\nThen I was like, fuck it.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nI'm going to walk outside.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nI went, it was on Olympic in La Cienega.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:32.000\nI went around to somebody's house and on our apartment building and peed on the side of\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\nan apartment building because I had no hope.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nI had no chance.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:37.000\nI ran back into my car.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:40.000\nI called Randy back and I was like, I'm so sorry.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:41.000\nI saw you were calling.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nI didn't want you to freak out that I wasn't up for the thing.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:46.000\nBut I had to pee so badly that I just peed on the side of a building.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:49.000\nAnd you said, I just peed on the side of a building.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:50.000\nIs that true?\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:51.000\nNo, that is true.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nAnd that is so fucked up.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:59.000\nThat is the most twin thing that's ever happened is that we both drank too much coffee before\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\ngoing to LAX.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nAnd that was creepy.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:06.000\nThat almost made us want to stop doing comedy.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nThat moment right there.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:14.000\nBut if we looked at your text messages, are you guys just nonstop checking in with each\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:15.000\nother?\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nI just brought you out as the Scar brothers.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:22.000\nI didn't call you Randy in whatever the other one's name is.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nThat's what I do.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nJesus, you've been hanging out with us.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:27.000\nYou've been called brothers.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nYou've been booked as the brothers.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:32.000\nYou're Burger King commercials as the Scar brothers.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:38.000\nBut obviously, there can't be any because you were born that way, literally.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:42.000\nThere is no buildup of resentment or craving for individuality, right?\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:45.000\nUnless we find out right now.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:47.000\nJason is not a planet.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nYeah, no.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nI've been demoted.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nApparently, I don't have a fucking name.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:54.000\nThank you, Billy Bob.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nNo.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:59.000\nWell, we have separate families and separate lives.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:04.000\nAnd so, you know, like, I think the fact that we, even up into that point, but the fact\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:11.000\nthat we now have kids and wives and we have multiple wives, Bill Paxton, RIP.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:15.000\nYou guys, you guys each have one wife and then you have a third wife that you didn't\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:19.000\nbreak or Kronenberg, like you swap off.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:20.000\nThe relief wife.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:24.000\nWe each have second families, but it's the same.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nAnd they don't know about it.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:30.000\nSo they think it's just the same person coming in.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:33.000\nThat's the third wife is she just lives in an apartment with what she thinks is a guy\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nnamed Elijah Sklar.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nRight.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:37.000\nHe just comes in.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:38.000\nA man who's not a twin.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:39.000\nSometimes he has glasses.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:40.000\nSometimes he doesn't.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:41.000\nHe's just super attentive.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nHe's around a lot for her.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:47.000\nBut the catch is one of you falls in love with her.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:55.000\nI was going to say Thursday is on CBS, but it's called Hidden Figure.\n\n19:55.000 --> 20:00.000\nAll right.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:06.000\nWell, yeah, so we do have our own lives and what's crazy is that since we've had our\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:11.000\nown families and kids and stuff, the, the, the, when we get together and we hang out with\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:12.000\nit, can I say this?\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:13.000\nIs this all right?\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:14.000\nSure.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:15.000\nSure.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.000\nThanks, Rob.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:17.000\nThanks, Rob.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nWhen we hang out, thanks, Spencer.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:20.000\nWe hang out.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.000\nIt just, it's fun.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:27.000\nWe actually look forward to it because I feel like we enjoy it more now than ever before\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:28.000\nbecause speak for yourself.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:29.000\nOh, no.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nIs there a tone you guys have?\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:38.000\nLike if you, if you're, if you're by yourselves, the two of you, and then everybody else is\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\ngone, does it ever get dark?\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:46.000\nLike, like you share with each other this kind of like, you're like, oh, that one, you\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:50.000\nknow, like, or something or like, like, you guys are only on each other's sides and there's\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:54.000\nlike, like some fucking like weird energy between you where you're like, yes.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nI don't think it's a weird energy.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nOh, I was going to say yes.\n\n20:58.000 --> 20:59.000\nYeah.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:01.000\nNo, maybe we're misinterpreting the energy between us.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nI think it's very normal.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nYou think it's weird?\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nOh, that's strange.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:05.000\nWho the fuck are you?\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:06.000\nI don't know.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:07.000\nThis is Dan.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nFuck.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:11.840\nUh, no, I, I think it is, I can describe it like this.\n\n21:11.840 --> 21:15.600\nI do think it, it goes beyond the normal sibling relationship.\n\n21:15.600 --> 21:20.400\nIt goes beyond the normal, uh, friend relationship.\n\n21:20.400 --> 21:24.120\nLike we're past the point where you share things with each other.\n\n21:24.120 --> 21:25.840\nThis is going to sound so bizarre.\n\n21:25.840 --> 21:28.320\nWe are past the point where you share things with each other.\n\n21:28.320 --> 21:32.960\nAnd I think because we're twins in some weird way, we're allowed, we allow ourselves to\n\n21:32.960 --> 21:35.920\nbe as hard on the other person as you would be on yourself.\n\n21:35.920 --> 21:40.240\nSo as negative as you would be about yourself, you, and that to me is an intimacy to like,\n\n21:40.240 --> 21:46.960\nrip on someone who isn't you, the way you would basically rip on yourself is so intimate.\n\n21:46.960 --> 21:50.560\nBut also I would, it's what every marriage should be upside to that is that you can confide\n\n21:50.560 --> 21:56.080\nin them and you wouldn't like, if I had a twin brother and then I found out like, I\n\n21:56.080 --> 21:58.960\nwas like, wait, oh, redhead cheerleaders.\n\n21:58.960 --> 22:03.440\nI'd like, I'd like call my brother and go, I think it's redhead cheerleaders.\n\n22:03.440 --> 22:04.440\nRight.\n\n22:04.440 --> 22:08.040\nThe combination has something to do with athletic socks and he'd be like, wait, oh, yeah.\n\n22:08.040 --> 22:12.200\nI don't know anything like that where you'd be like, you'd call him up and go like, wait,\n\n22:12.200 --> 22:15.400\ndo you, are you, do you hate beans?\n\n22:15.400 --> 22:17.520\nSo that's, that's, that's our journey.\n\n22:17.520 --> 22:21.960\nI think what you're just describing right there is to get, to actually, we're so close\n\n22:21.960 --> 22:22.960\nto each other.\n\n22:22.960 --> 22:26.800\nWe're actually stepped on the other side of each other facing away from each other.\n\n22:26.800 --> 22:32.120\nSo the key is now over the course of our lives, yeah, to the beginning of a duel.\n\n22:32.120 --> 22:37.400\nIt's literally like, not to get all Hamilton about it, but the second movie poster from\n\n22:37.400 --> 22:38.400\nyour trilogy.\n\n22:38.400 --> 22:39.400\nThat's right.\n\n22:39.400 --> 22:40.400\nIt's just that.\n\n22:40.400 --> 22:41.400\nThe third one is the turn.\n\n22:41.400 --> 22:42.400\nYou're facing each other again.\n\n22:42.400 --> 22:43.400\nYeah.\n\n22:43.400 --> 22:44.400\nGunpoint.\n\n22:44.400 --> 22:45.400\nAnd in between us is a redheaded cheerleader.\n\n22:45.400 --> 22:46.400\nSo.\n\n22:46.400 --> 22:47.400\nSops up.\n\n22:47.400 --> 22:48.400\nSops.\n\n22:48.400 --> 22:49.400\nIt's Julianne Moore.\n\n22:49.400 --> 22:50.400\nJulianne Moore.\n\n22:50.400 --> 22:51.400\nYeah.\n\n22:51.400 --> 22:54.760\nIt's like, it's, it's, it's the, it's the dark version of fabulous Baker boys.\n\n22:54.760 --> 22:55.760\nRight.\n\n22:55.760 --> 22:56.760\nYes.\n\n22:56.760 --> 22:57.760\nYes.\n\n22:57.760 --> 23:03.040\nSo now our thing in life is, I think to peel it back and actually have the type of relationship\n\n23:03.040 --> 23:05.480\nthat a close siblings would have.\n\n23:05.480 --> 23:07.480\nThat is our work that we have to do.\n\n23:07.480 --> 23:11.000\nIn other words, kind of examining yourselves for your individuality a little bit.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:12.000\nTotally.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:15.640\nExperimenting with like, kind of like, you know what, like, like actually withholding\n\n23:15.640 --> 23:16.640\nfrom each other.\n\n23:16.640 --> 23:17.640\nTotally.\n\n23:17.640 --> 23:18.640\nSo that there is.\n\n23:18.640 --> 23:19.640\nYes.\n\n23:19.640 --> 23:20.640\nAnd or taking time apart from each other.\n\n23:20.640 --> 23:22.480\nSo when we're not working, we're not doing that stuff.\n\n23:22.480 --> 23:26.440\nWe do spend time with our different friends and family, friends and whatnot.\n\n23:26.440 --> 23:29.280\nSo then when we do come back together, we are actually happy.\n\n23:29.280 --> 23:35.400\nI have to wonder if this biologically, psychologically mirrors the stage in a normal individual's\n\n23:35.400 --> 23:40.160\nlife when they would be going through some threshold, that that's something that I've\n\n23:40.160 --> 23:42.480\nnever heard about in twin studies.\n\n23:42.480 --> 23:45.320\nWe're always so obsessed with like, Oh, who, what's the difference between nature and nurture?\n\n23:45.320 --> 23:46.320\nLet's study these twins.\n\n23:46.320 --> 23:47.320\nRight.\n\n23:47.320 --> 23:52.560\nBut like that idea that, that twins have that unfettered intimacy and that you guys are\n\n23:52.560 --> 23:55.120\nexperiencing this, this weird crisscross right now.\n\n23:55.120 --> 24:01.480\nI wonder if that coincides with, with the age at which a person goes through a lot of\n\n24:01.480 --> 24:02.480\ncrisis.\n\n24:02.480 --> 24:03.480\nLike, wait, who am I?\n\n24:03.480 --> 24:04.480\nYeah.\n\n24:04.480 --> 24:05.480\nI think so for sure.\n\n24:05.480 --> 24:11.000\nBut I think we're, we, we experienced that more because mid twin crisis, mid twin crisis.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:16.080\nBut I think it's also cause we're comedians or we are constantly examining our relationship\n\n24:16.080 --> 24:19.640\nand who we are and what we're about and what's wrong with us and all that stuff.\n\n24:19.640 --> 24:24.560\nSo yeah, we, we only participated in one twin study ever at, we grew up in St. Louis, Washington\n\n24:24.560 --> 24:30.400\nUniversity and I don't want to say we fuck this thing up, but like, I had to go into\n\n24:30.400 --> 24:33.080\na room and this is no joke.\n\n24:33.080 --> 24:34.640\nThis actually happened.\n\n24:34.640 --> 24:35.640\nPeople were stunning this.\n\n24:35.640 --> 24:36.640\nI had to stare.\n\n24:36.640 --> 24:40.640\nThere was like, it was just a little machine that would just light up with a red light\n\n24:40.640 --> 24:45.680\nwhen in another room, Randy was looking at a picture and I'm just looking at the hall,\n\n24:45.680 --> 24:51.800\nlooking at a picture and I, for no reason, Rob, just rubbed my temples as if to send\n\n24:51.800 --> 24:52.800\nit to me.\n\n24:52.800 --> 24:56.560\nIf to fucking send it through the ether to him like, cause I was like, that's what you're\n\n24:56.560 --> 24:57.560\nsupposed to do.\n\n24:57.560 --> 25:02.560\nAnd I just had to, when the light came on, draw what popped into my head to see if he\n\n25:02.560 --> 25:09.360\ncould send it across a hallway at Wash U. And not only did I not draw even a remotely\n\n25:09.360 --> 25:14.640\nclose shape to anything he was looking at, it was so bad, like we, they shut down the\n\n25:14.640 --> 25:15.640\nexperiment.\n\n25:15.640 --> 25:16.640\nThey lost funding.\n\n25:16.640 --> 25:21.560\nThey lost their grant and their funding because of our results.\n\n25:21.560 --> 25:22.560\nWhat did you draw?\n\n25:22.560 --> 25:23.560\nWhat did you draw?\n\n25:23.560 --> 25:29.600\nI drew, I remember he was looking at a tree, like a very tall tree and I drew a star, nothing\n\n25:29.600 --> 25:32.160\nlike a tree, rounded edges and all that stuff.\n\n25:32.160 --> 25:36.480\nYou were looking at a cow and I drew, I drew a car.\n\n25:36.480 --> 25:39.560\nYou were looking at what, can you remember any of what the other ones were?\n\n25:39.560 --> 25:40.560\nI can't.\n\n25:40.560 --> 25:42.760\nYou were looking, why don't you get in my head and find out.\n\n25:42.760 --> 25:43.760\nOkay.\n\n25:43.760 --> 25:44.760\nLet me rub them.\n\n25:44.760 --> 25:45.760\nBut I can't remember.\n\n25:45.760 --> 25:46.760\nWe were so off.\n\n25:46.760 --> 25:49.680\nIt was so off that they couldn't even, it proved to us that we're like that, I don't\n\n25:49.680 --> 25:50.680\nbelieve in that shit.\n\n25:50.680 --> 25:51.680\nI really don't.\n\n25:51.680 --> 25:58.440\nI really, but being a comedian, weren't you tempted to just keep drawing dicks?\n\n25:58.440 --> 25:59.440\nEvery car.\n\n25:59.440 --> 26:00.440\nHe keeps thinking about that.\n\n26:00.440 --> 26:01.440\nI don't know.\n\n26:01.440 --> 26:02.440\nHe's only 13.\n\n26:02.440 --> 26:03.440\nMy brother.\n\n26:03.440 --> 26:07.440\nThe car had a dick coming out of its mouth.\n\n26:07.440 --> 26:09.440\nIt's just, I'm sorry, everything.\n\n26:09.440 --> 26:10.440\nBrother, keep thinking about dick.\n\n26:10.440 --> 26:12.440\nI don't know if you're looking at a cow, but he's thinking about dick.\n\n26:12.440 --> 26:16.440\nCow had two dicks just so I can do on it.\n\n26:16.440 --> 26:25.440\nWell, let's bring up Brandon Johnson because he's back there, like pushing.\n\n26:25.440 --> 26:38.440\nHi, Brandon, what is this shit about Pluto, man?\n\n26:38.440 --> 26:39.440\nYeah, right?\n\n26:39.440 --> 26:47.080\nI just heard back there, all that talk about, I don't know what's going on.\n\n26:47.080 --> 26:48.080\nIs it a planet?\n\n26:48.080 --> 26:49.080\nIs it not a planet?\n\n26:49.080 --> 26:50.080\nRiveting.\n\n26:50.080 --> 26:51.080\nRiveting.\n\n26:51.080 --> 26:52.080\nRiveting.\n\n26:52.080 --> 27:02.920\nI can see Steve Harvey starting like a stand-up act, just like, what is this shit about Pluto?\n\n27:02.920 --> 27:05.320\nNow, you're a woman, right?\n\n27:05.320 --> 27:06.320\nPluto.\n\n27:06.320 --> 27:07.320\nYou're a planet.\n\n27:07.320 --> 27:09.520\nYou're a planet.\n\n27:09.520 --> 27:18.240\nSpeaking of comedy and comedians, I just drew a dick in my mind, Rob.\n\n27:18.240 --> 27:26.960\nI was at this function and Martin Short was being given an award and he just fucking murdered.\n\n27:26.960 --> 27:28.480\nWere you guys Martin Short fans?\n\n27:28.480 --> 27:29.480\nHuge.\n\n27:29.480 --> 27:35.320\nAnd then when he did Jiminy Glick, I was like, that is the most electric character.\n\n27:35.320 --> 27:37.200\nMartin Short was my guy.\n\n27:37.200 --> 27:43.600\nWhen I was in sixth grade, I think a lot of us, we start just by imitating people.\n\n27:43.600 --> 27:54.640\nI would just do Ed Grimly and Jack, let's see that, I'm mental, I must say, why is Billy\n\n27:54.640 --> 27:56.760\nBob Thornton doing Ed Grimly?\n\n27:56.760 --> 27:59.760\nBilly Bob Thornton, why are you so mental Billy Bob?\n\n27:59.760 --> 28:00.760\nIt's amazing.\n\n28:00.760 --> 28:08.040\nI want mashed potatoes, I must say, I must say, I'm completely mental, oh my God, oh\n\n28:08.040 --> 28:09.640\nmy God, it's fucking beautiful.\n\n28:09.640 --> 28:11.560\nWhy are you holding a triangle suddenly?\n\n28:11.560 --> 28:17.000\nIf you do this mouth, you could do John Lithgow, oh my God.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:22.480\nBrandon, who are your childhood comedy people?\n\n28:22.480 --> 28:27.280\nI love the Broadway whoopee was one of the first things I ever saw.\n\n28:27.280 --> 28:32.000\nThe young comedian special Robin Williams was one of the first things I ever saw.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:36.440\nI had to like, we had an old ass TV and we got HBO and we had dials on the shit, so\n\n28:36.440 --> 28:40.960\nI had to like, back in the day if you got cable, you had to hook it up and you'd have\n\n28:40.960 --> 28:45.400\nto dial for like, maybe a half an hour, just turn a dial, until the cable hooked up with\n\n28:45.400 --> 28:50.560\nlike a raw signal, and fucking remember it, three o'clock in the morning, dial, dial, dial,\n\n28:50.560 --> 28:56.480\nand then whoopee girl Berg around the world in 88 days, and I was like, what the fuck.\n\n28:56.480 --> 29:01.840\nSo you like the character pieces, like the one woman show, kind of like, I'm going to\n\n29:01.840 --> 29:07.280\ndo 20 minutes as this person, and I mean that's what you were like.\n\n29:07.280 --> 29:12.880\nI mean, it's just my earliest memory of somebody who inspired me, but I didn't think like,\n\n29:12.880 --> 29:16.760\nI wasn't like, one woman show type, that's why I was in shock, I was like, this is one\n\n29:16.760 --> 29:23.240\nwoman show, but it's funny, like, wasn't you molested when you were a kid or something?\n\n29:23.240 --> 29:26.840\nThat's always how you can tell if someone's giving you a compliment or they hate something,\n\n29:26.840 --> 29:28.120\nlike, how high their voice is.\n\n29:28.120 --> 29:30.320\nAsk me how her one woman show was.\n\n29:30.320 --> 29:32.400\nHow was her one woman show?\n\n29:32.400 --> 29:33.400\nScoot!\n\n29:33.400 --> 29:34.960\nHated it, hated it.\n\n29:34.960 --> 29:38.640\nOkay, now ask me how her one woman show was.\n\n29:38.640 --> 29:39.840\nHow was her one woman show?\n\n29:39.840 --> 29:40.840\nIt was good.\n\n29:40.840 --> 29:41.840\nOh, love it.\n\n29:41.840 --> 29:42.840\nThat means it was really good.\n\n29:42.840 --> 29:43.840\nHoly shit.\n\n29:43.840 --> 29:44.840\nWow.\n\n29:44.840 --> 29:45.840\nA lot of characters.\n\n29:45.840 --> 29:46.840\nYou loved it.\n\n29:46.840 --> 29:47.840\nA lot of characters, man.\n\n29:47.840 --> 29:48.840\nWait a minute.\n\n29:48.840 --> 29:49.840\nWait a minute.\n\n29:49.840 --> 29:52.840\nAll of my one woman shows have been terrible.\n\n29:52.840 --> 29:54.840\nNo, they were good!\n\n29:54.840 --> 29:55.840\nThey were great!\n\n29:55.840 --> 29:56.840\nThey were great!\n\n29:56.840 --> 29:57.840\nThey were great!\n\n29:57.840 --> 29:58.840\nThey were great!\n\n29:58.840 --> 29:59.840\nThey were great!\n\n29:59.840 --> 30:00.840\nThey were great!\n\n30:00.840 --> 30:01.840\nWait a minute.\n\n30:01.840 --> 30:08.080\nThis is a little unrelated, but Schrab revealed to me at dinner tonight that he's going to\n\n30:08.080 --> 30:09.080\nchoose...\n\n30:09.080 --> 30:10.080\nTo us.\n\n30:10.080 --> 30:11.080\nTo us.\n\n30:11.080 --> 30:12.080\nI was there.\n\n30:12.080 --> 30:14.080\nThanks, Spence.\n\n30:14.080 --> 30:18.840\nYou were sitting at the next table, though, facing the wall.\n\n30:18.840 --> 30:19.840\nWhy did they make you do that?\n\n30:19.840 --> 30:21.840\nIt's because you didn't order anything.\n\n30:21.840 --> 30:22.840\nRight, yeah.\n\n30:22.840 --> 30:23.840\nI forgot.\n\n30:23.840 --> 30:30.760\nYou gotta eat a chimichanga you want a presence at my table.\n\n30:30.760 --> 30:36.960\nSchrab revealed to us that he is going to a vocal coach.\n\n30:36.960 --> 30:37.960\nYes.\n\n30:37.960 --> 30:39.760\nBecause he wants his voice lower.\n\n30:39.760 --> 30:40.760\nWow.\n\n30:40.760 --> 30:41.760\nThat's not completely it.\n\n30:41.760 --> 30:42.760\nLet me ask you.\n\n30:42.760 --> 30:43.760\nNo, okay.\n\n30:43.760 --> 30:44.760\nAll right, all right, okay.\n\n30:44.760 --> 30:45.760\nHow is that working out for you?\n\n30:45.760 --> 30:46.760\nIt's good.\n\n30:46.760 --> 30:47.760\nIt's good.\n\n30:47.760 --> 30:48.760\nIt's good.\n\n30:48.760 --> 30:49.760\nIt's going pretty well, right?\n\n30:49.760 --> 30:50.760\nYeah.\n\n30:50.760 --> 30:51.760\nHow is your vocal coach?\n\n30:51.760 --> 30:52.760\nIt's good.\n\n30:52.760 --> 30:53.760\nIt's good.\n\n30:53.760 --> 30:54.760\nIt's good.\n\n30:54.760 --> 30:55.760\nIt's good.\n\n30:55.760 --> 30:56.760\nIt's good.\n\n30:56.760 --> 30:57.760\nIt's good.\n\n30:57.760 --> 30:58.760\nIt's good.\n\n30:58.760 --> 30:59.760\nIt's good.\n\n30:59.760 --> 31:00.760\nIt's good.\n\n31:00.760 --> 31:01.760\nI hope it's going better.\n\n31:01.760 --> 31:05.760\nIt just started, so you're not going to hear anything.\n\n31:05.760 --> 31:09.760\nObviously, my knee jerk reflex was, you know, maybe this is a little disrespectful to Schrab,\n\n31:09.760 --> 31:14.760\nlike, because people, we have a tendency to, if somebody were to say to us, like, oh,\n\n31:14.760 --> 31:17.760\nI'm going to do this, you know, if somebody you respect and you like, like, we have a knee\n\n31:17.760 --> 31:21.760\njerk reaction that comes from the best of intentions, which is we kind of like, we want to argue\n\n31:21.760 --> 31:22.760\nwith them.\n\n31:22.760 --> 31:23.760\nLike, no, you shouldn't do that.\n\n31:23.760 --> 31:24.760\nYou shouldn't change.\n\n31:24.760 --> 31:25.760\nYou're finding a way you are.\n\n31:25.760 --> 31:26.760\nRight.\n\n31:26.760 --> 31:30.760\nI do, but I've inspected it from that angle, and I'm still like, what the fuck is he talking\n\n31:30.760 --> 31:31.760\nabout?\n\n31:31.760 --> 31:32.760\nWhy?\n\n31:32.760 --> 31:35.480\nI just wanted to bring it up, because I just like, I don't, you were saying, Rob, that\n\n31:35.480 --> 31:39.960\nthe guy was saying, when you went in for your consultation, that he said, you're holding\n\n31:39.960 --> 31:41.760\nyour breath more than you should, or something like that.\n\n31:41.760 --> 31:46.760\nWell, I mean, right now I'm comfortable in everything, but when I'm, you know, on set,\n\n31:46.760 --> 31:52.880\nor I'm, you know, in a pitch meeting, if, you know, when I'm having a bad time, I tend\n\n31:52.880 -->

alright.\n\n32:47.540 --> 33:00.540\nYou didn't really find anything you liked in it.\n\n33:00.540 --> 33:02.740\nWell there was this one part.\n\n33:02.740 --> 33:03.740\nHe must have loved that part.\n\n33:03.740 --> 33:04.740\nThat's actually incredible.\n\n33:04.740 --> 33:05.740\nMark Short came out.\n\n33:05.740 --> 33:06.740\nMark Short came out.\n\n33:06.740 --> 33:07.740\nMark Short

33:14.740\nAnd then, you know, he introduced Chevy Chase.\n\n33:14.740 --> 33:15.740\nChevy Chase.\n\n33:15.740 --> 33:16.740\nThat's good.\n\n33:16.740 --> 33:17.740\nThat's good.\n\n33:17.740 --> 33:28.940\nBut this is what I'm talking about, you know, when you're talking like this, which is my\n\n33:28.940 --> 33:36.540\ncomfortable register, you know, which to some people is grading, you know, I just like,\n\n33:36.540 --> 33:42.420\nyou know, I'm trying to, I'm just trying to, trying to fix this fucking problem, which\n\n33:42.420 --> 33:43.420\nis my life.\n\n33:43.420 --> 33:44.940\nI think a lot of people like your voices.\n\n33:44.940 --> 33:45.940\nI think I like it.\n\n33:45.940 --> 33:47.940\nA lot of people don't.\n\n33:47.940 --> 33:53.260\nWell, Rob, but when I first met you, like Rob, I mean, when your origin story is your\n\n33:53.260 --> 33:59.940\nhairpiece story, like Rob lost his hair at a very young age and at a time before Pulp\n\n33:59.940 --> 34:04.180\nFiction, before it was even possible to be masculine and bald, like in cinema, before\n\n34:04.180 --> 34:05.180\nBruce Willis.\n\n34:05.180 --> 34:06.180\nImpossible.\n\n34:06.180 --> 34:09.020\nBefore it was a big rave from that movie, Jesus.\n\n34:09.020 --> 34:17.420\nWell, before, and before Jean, the new captain goddamn Picard, like, like there was no, there\n\n34:17.420 --> 34:22.380\nweren't bald, bald men were, you know, whatever, the, the, the hair loss was different as you\n\n34:22.380 --> 34:23.380\ngo up through the ages.\n\n34:23.380 --> 34:28.540\nI'm not saying it's equivalent to anything else that's a struggle, but, but, but you\n\n34:28.540 --> 34:34.340\ntold the story of like, you had a girlfriend that was like, you know, she made it obvious\n\n34:34.340 --> 34:38.420\nthat she said if you had hair, you know, maybe you do need a hairpiece.\n\n34:38.420 --> 34:41.860\nAnd then you went to the, you went to the hair, had Lions Club.\n\n34:41.860 --> 34:42.860\nLions Club, yes.\n\n34:42.860 --> 34:47.020\nAnd you went and you, you, you had them outfit you with a fucking head of hair.\n\n34:47.020 --> 34:54.900\nSo real hair, somebody's hair was woven into a wig and, and, and I was like, oh man, this\n\n34:54.900 --> 34:55.900\nis it.\n\n34:55.900 --> 34:58.900\nI'm going to be fucking sexy again.\n\n34:58.900 --> 34:59.900\nAnyway.\n\n34:59.900 --> 35:05.300\nAnd it looks, looked like exactly how you're picturing it.\n\n35:05.300 --> 35:07.780\nI'm just like.\n\n35:07.780 --> 35:15.420\nLike a hair hat, like a bull cut round hair, like, and, and, and I walked home wearing\n\n35:15.420 --> 35:25.940\nit just like walking down the street, crossing the street and wearing it and then looked\n\n35:25.940 --> 35:32.100\nmyself in the mirror and I said, oh shit, I can't, I can't do this.\n\n35:32.100 --> 35:37.740\nAnd I put it in a shoe box and then I, I walked back to the Lions Club and I said, I can't\n\n35:37.740 --> 35:38.740\ndo this.\n\n35:38.740 --> 35:39.740\nI'm sorry.\n\n35:39.740 --> 35:44.180\nAnd I gave it back to them and I left and then I shaved my head and then I never had\n\n35:44.180 --> 35:45.380\na problem with it ever again.\n\n35:45.380 --> 35:46.380\nYeah.\n\n35:46.380 --> 35:48.540\nSo, you know, that was 19 everybody.\n\n35:48.540 --> 35:50.580\nAnd that woman is now your vocal coach.\n\n35:50.580 --> 35:51.580\nYeah.\n\n35:51.580 --> 35:52.580\nFull circle guys.\n\n35:52.580 --> 35:55.580\nDon't you make the equation there with your voice?\n\n35:55.580 --> 36:00.140\nI mean, who cares what your voice, I mean, like, like, you know, I'm, I like me.\n\n36:00.140 --> 36:01.380\nI like my voice.\n\n36:01.380 --> 36:07.180\nI just, I'm, I'm, it's all about like when I don't like me and when I don't like my\n\n36:07.180 --> 36:12.460\nvoice, it's, it's, I'm trying to get over that, you know, part.\n\n36:12.460 --> 36:13.460\nIt's not right now.\n\n36:13.460 --> 36:14.460\nAll right.\n\n36:14.460 --> 36:17.740\nI mean, I'm not trying to high road you, but isn't it easier to just, to, to change\n\n36:17.740 --> 36:21.300\nthe way that you feel about yourself than change your voice?\n\n36:21.300 --> 36:22.300\nYes, exactly.\n\n36:22.300 --> 36:23.300\nExactly.\n\n36:23.300 --> 36:24.300\nAnd I think this is a part of it.\n\n36:24.300 --> 36:25.700\nWell, when you, oh, this show, this show right here.\n\n36:25.700 --> 36:26.700\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n36:26.700 --> 36:30.980\nWell, the training is like, like I said to you when I explained while I was doing this.\n\n36:30.980 --> 36:31.980\nIn confidence.\n\n36:31.980 --> 36:32.980\nYes.\n\n36:32.980 --> 36:39.860\nWhen I said, I said, like, look, you know, if it's, even if it's a placebo, if I, in\n\n36:39.860 --> 36:44.420\nthe past, when I've done the homework and then I've gone into like a meeting where I\n\n36:44.420 --> 36:51.660\nneed to be everything I need to be and everything I know that I need to do and can do, I can\n\n36:51.660 --> 36:52.660\ndo it.\n\n36:52.660 --> 36:55.780\nBut, you know, when, you know, that's what it's all about.\n\n36:55.780 --> 36:56.780\nWell, I found.\n\n36:56.780 --> 36:57.780\nSome things I don't like about myself.\n\n36:57.780 --> 36:59.300\nUh, what do you, what do you do?\n\n36:59.300 --> 37:00.300\nLike what?\n\n37:00.300 --> 37:01.300\nGet into it.\n\n37:01.300 --> 37:03.300\nTop five.\n\n37:03.300 --> 37:05.300\nTeen.\n\n37:05.300 --> 37:07.020\n15.\n\n37:07.020 --> 37:08.020\nTop five.\n\n37:08.020 --> 37:09.020\nTeen.\n\n37:09.020 --> 37:10.020\nThings you don't like about yourself.\n\n37:10.020 --> 37:11.020\nLet me start.\n\n37:11.020 --> 37:12.020\nAttitude.\n\n37:12.020 --> 37:13.020\nWait a minute.\n\n37:13.020 --> 37:14.020\nWait a minute.\n\n37:14.020 --> 37:15.020\nWait.\n\n37:15.020 --> 37:16.020\nNo, this is for him to answer.\n\n37:16.020 --> 37:17.020\nEye contact.\n\n37:17.020 --> 37:18.020\nNo, it's for him.\n\n37:18.020 --> 37:19.020\nReturning text.\n\n37:19.020 --> 37:20.020\nWow.\n\n37:20.020 --> 37:22.820\nYour Billy Bob Thornton impression.\n\n37:22.820 --> 37:23.820\nYes.\n\n37:23.820 --> 37:24.820\nDinner secrets.\n\n37:24.820 --> 37:25.820\nTime management.\n\n37:25.820 --> 37:31.820\nWhat do we just get?\n\n37:31.820 --> 37:32.820\nSeven?\n\n37:32.820 --> 37:33.820\nAll of those things.\n\n37:33.820 --> 37:36.820\nI, I'd like a little less hair on my shoulders.\n\n37:36.820 --> 37:37.820\nYeah.\n\n37:37.820 --> 37:44.540\nAnd I wish, I wish that my toe and fingernails didn't grow, but I guess that's a universal\n\n37:44.540 --> 37:45.540\nhuman thing.\n\n37:45.540 --> 37:46.540\nYeah.\n\n37:46.540 --> 37:47.540\nThis is going to happen.\n\n37:47.540 --> 37:48.540\nUh, I feel like we should have invented that.\n\n37:48.540 --> 37:50.300\nThat'll happen after you're dead.\n\n37:50.300 --> 37:56.580\nI wish that the hair on my legs didn't stop, um, just short of my ankles.\n\n37:56.580 --> 37:58.740\nThat was because you were abducted by aliens.\n\n37:58.740 --> 38:02.260\nThat's what you told me, like in 1997.\n\n38:02.260 --> 38:03.260\nWere you?\n\n38:03.260 --> 38:05.460\nI think it's because I wore my socks too much when I was a kid.\n\n38:05.460 --> 38:06.460\nI don't know.\n\n38:06.460 --> 38:10.500\nNo, no, you said I was abducted by aliens, and that's why the hair on your legs doesn't\n\n38:10.500 --> 38:12.660\ngo all the way up to your kneecaps.\n\n38:12.660 --> 38:14.580\nWell, which one is it?\n\n38:14.580 --> 38:16.300\nHarmless socks or aliens?\n\n38:16.300 --> 38:17.300\nWhich one?\n\n38:17.300 --> 38:18.900\nI don't remember that conversation.\n\n38:18.900 --> 38:23.340\nMaybe I was, maybe I was defending myself against a new adult friend who was inquiring\n\n38:23.340 --> 38:24.340\nabout my body hair.\n\n38:24.340 --> 38:25.340\nI don't know.\n\n38:25.340 --> 38:26.340\nI don't remember.\n\n38:26.340 --> 38:27.340\nIt was 1997.\n\n38:27.340 --> 38:30.340\nWe've known each other since 91.\n\n38:30.340 --> 38:33.940\nI thought this was from dinner the other night, you know, the last night.\n\n38:33.940 --> 38:37.740\nWell, back then in the late nineties, we were getting into alien abduction mythology because\n\n38:37.740 --> 38:41.300\nwe were trying to write a screenplay about alien abductions and things, like, like, and\n\n38:41.300 --> 38:42.500\nI was researching a lot of it.\n\n38:42.500 --> 38:47.580\nSo I was starting to think about my frequent nosebleeds and maybe body hair patterns because\n\n38:47.580 --> 38:50.100\nthey were being mirrored in the testimonials in the book.\n\n38:50.100 --> 38:52.540\nI no longer believe that.\n\n38:52.540 --> 38:56.260\nI think it's probably, how's your guys' body hair?\n\n38:56.260 --> 39:00.460\nOh, I think I have more body hair than you do.\n\n39:00.460 --> 39:01.460\nYeah.\n\n39:01.460 --> 39:02.460\nHow is that possible?\n\n39:02.460 --> 39:03.460\nI don't know.\n\n39:03.460 --> 39:06.780\nBut you guys must, like, text each other, like, you must have been to it and go, like,\n\n39:06.780 --> 39:08.580\ndo you have that thing with your nipple?\n\n39:08.580 --> 39:09.580\nYeah.\n\n39:09.580 --> 39:10.580\nDo you?\n\n39:10.580 --> 39:11.580\nI don't want to hear.\n\n39:11.580 --> 39:12.580\nWe don't text each other.\n\n39:12.580 --> 39:14.260\nI can grow a beard, like, in 20 minutes.\n\n39:14.260 --> 39:15.260\nYeah.\n\n39:15.260 --> 39:21.060\nI really want to know, do you guys, like, actually, like, like, sexually, do you exchange\n\n39:21.060 --> 39:23.980\nnot so hot twins?\n\n39:23.980 --> 39:24.980\nDo you?\n\n39:24.980 --> 39:25.980\nSo fucking hot.\n\n39:25.980 --> 39:26.980\nNo, that's...\n\n39:26.980 --> 39:28.980\nDo you get that a lot?\n\n39:28.980 --> 39:29.980\nOh, man.\n\n39:29.980 --> 39:30.980\nTwins.\n\n39:30.980 --> 39:31.980\nAnd twins.\n\n39:31.980 --> 39:32.980\nAnd twins.\n\n39:32.980 --> 39:33.980\nSo hot.\n\n39:33.980 --> 39:39.980\nIf one of you experiences something, if one of you, like, try a cock ring or an accidently,\n\n39:39.980 --> 39:45.140\nlike, twist both your nipples while you were orgasming or you put on a pantyhose over your\n\n39:45.140 --> 39:50.220\nface and swung from a ceiling fan, and then you, like, come your brains out, do you text\n\n39:50.220 --> 39:52.420\nthe other one and go, like, have you tried this?\n\n39:52.420 --> 39:53.420\nYeah.\n\n39:53.420 --> 39:54.420\nBecause you might be into it.\n\n39:54.420 --> 39:55.420\nYou might love it.\n\n39:55.420 --> 39:56.420\nBecause you're genetically identical.\n\n39:56.420 --> 39:58.620\nI've cracked the code.\n\n39:58.620 --> 39:59.620\nWe haven't yet.\n\n39:59.620 --> 40:00.620\nNo, we haven't.\n\n40:00.620 --> 40:01.620\nMaybe we should start.\n\n40:01.620 --> 40:03.220\nAll those things you suggested, I just made a mental note.\n\n40:03.220 --> 40:04.220\nI was like, maybe.\n\n40:04.220 --> 40:05.220\nYeah.\n\n40:05.220 --> 40:06.220\nIt's possible.\n\n40:06.220 --> 40:08.140\nAll those things people do because they don't have twin brothers.\n\n40:08.140 --> 40:09.140\nSo you guys have a...\n\n40:09.140 --> 40:13.140\nLike, maybe we're all more darker and private and we're a little... we're suffocated in our\n\n40:13.140 --> 40:14.140\ncocoons.\n\n40:14.140 --> 40:15.140\nRight.\n\n40:15.140 --> 40:19.940\nAnd you guys are just... get to be more mainstream, like, you just lay the pipe, missionary style\n\n40:19.940 --> 40:20.940\nand...\n\n40:20.940 --> 40:21.940\nYeah.\n\n40:21.940 --> 40:22.940\n...roll over and smoke a cigarette.\n\n40:22.940 --> 40:23.940\nThat's right.\n\n40:23.940 --> 40:25.740\nNo, no conversation needed.\n\n40:25.740 --> 40:26.740\nRight.\n\n40:26.740 -->

three insane stories\n\n41:04.100 --> 41:05.620\nand going super deep.\n\n41:05.620 --> 41:06.620\nAnd the stories...\n\n41:06.620 --> 41:07.620\nStory number one.\n\n41:07.620 --> 41:08.620\nStory number one.\n\n41:08.620 --> 41:09.620\nHigh voices.\n\n41:09.620 --> 41:10.620\nNo.\n\n41:10.620 --> 41:11.620\nNo, no.\n\n41:11.620 --> 41:14.580\nNo, it's three crazy stories from the news\n\n41:14.580 --> 41:16.460\nthat we get from our listeners, actually.\n\n41:16.460 --> 41:18.700\nAnd then us and Dan Van Kirk, our co-host,\n\n41:18.700 --> 41:21.860\nalong with the guest, we just start riffing.\n\n41:21.860 --> 41:24.980\nAnd the stories are just comedy launching pads,\n\n41:24.980 --> 41:25.820\nand we just go.\n\n41:25.820 --> 41:26.700\nIt's kind of like a writer's room\n\n41:26.700 --> 41:28.500\nbefore you get down to the actual writing.\n\n41:28.500 --> 41:30.820\nHow much Florida is in there?\n\n41:30.820 --> 41:31.940\nIt's a lot of Florida.\n\n41:31.940 --> 41:35.300\nI mean, we know so much about it from the first line\n\n41:35.300 --> 41:37.820\nof like this person, like everyone,\n\n41:37.820 --> 41:40.580\nlike we can guess the age of people by their behavior now\n\n41:40.580 --> 41:41.900\nbecause we've done a bunch of them.\n\n41:41.900 --> 41:44.940\nLike, usually, I know when someone looks like they're 50,\n\n41:44.940 --> 41:46.220\nbut they're 33.\n\n41:46.220 --> 41:47.860\nLike, I can tell that from the whole story.\n\n41:47.860 --> 41:48.940\nHow old is Dan?\n\n41:51.180 --> 41:51.900\n33.\n\n41:51.900 --> 41:52.940\n33 years old?\n\n41:54.980 --> 41:55.820\nDaniel probably just...\n\n41:55.820 --> 41:56.820\nOh, that's about right.\n\n41:58.820 --> 41:59.780\nI think you're around our age,\n\n41:59.780 --> 42:01.220\nslightly older than us, but.\n\n42:02.220 --> 42:03.060\nWhat was that?\n\n42:03.060 --> 42:04.540\nWhat was that drug in Florida?\n\n42:04.540 --> 42:05.380\nWhat was it?\n\n42:05.380 --> 42:06.820\nYucca, flucca, fucca?\n\n42:06.820 --> 42:09.740\nWacca, flucca, flucca, flucca, flucca.\n\n42:09.740 --> 42:11.380\nI think that's a rapper.\n\n42:11.380 --> 42:14.940\nBut, yeah, no, there's always like,\n\n42:14.940 --> 42:17.100\nscissor and like these to every.\n\n42:17.100 --> 42:17.940\nScissor.\n\n42:18.940 --> 42:20.980\nIt's like the drugs are like going through\n\n42:20.980 --> 42:22.180\nwhat Silicon Valley is going through.\n\n42:22.180 --> 42:23.820\nLike, we have to come up with a word\n\n42:23.820 --> 42:26.060\nthat no one's squatted on the domain for.\n\n42:27.220 --> 42:29.260\nSo, someone's looking for a drug.\n\n42:29.260 --> 42:31.260\nWe don't want them to go to fucking.\n\n42:31.260 --> 42:32.420\nBeagle tots.\n\n42:33.540 --> 42:34.380\nNo, yeah.\n\n42:34.380 --> 42:35.220\nIt's insane.\n\n42:35.220 --> 42:36.940\nHas that been taken?\n\n42:36.940 --> 42:39.180\nNo, we had a story about a guy on a date\n\n42:39.180 --> 42:40.980\nwho I think this was in Florida\n\n42:40.980 --> 42:42.700\nwhere he was trying to impress his date\n\n42:42.700 --> 42:46.220\nand jump over like from one building to the next\n\n42:46.220 --> 42:49.500\nand he didn't make it and slid all the way down\n\n42:49.500 --> 42:50.980\nbetween the two buildings.\n\n42:50.980 --> 42:53.100\nThey got closer as it got there.\n\n42:53.100 --> 42:54.940\nCause they weren't built properly.\n\n42:54.940 --> 42:56.980\nAnd he got stuck and the fire department\n\n42:56.980 --> 42:58.940\nhad to come in and bust the wall down\n\n42:58.940 --> 43:00.580\nof a Chipotle to get him out.\n\n43:00.580 --> 43:02.020\nWhy did the buildings get close?\n\n43:02.020 --> 43:03.780\nIs it Tim Burton's?\n\n43:03.780 --> 43:08.780\nI tried to jump the leading tower.\n\n43:09.580 --> 43:10.780\nAre you ready for the distance\n\n43:10.780 --> 43:12.220\nbetween the two buildings?\n\n43:12.220 --> 43:13.220\nA foot and a half.\n\n43:14.620 --> 43:16.020\nHow long?\n\n43:16.020 --> 43:17.420\nWho misses that?\n\n43:17.420 --> 43:18.540\nIt was like this.\n\n43:18.540 --> 43:19.660\nSo he wasn't mad.\n\n43:19.660 --> 43:23.460\nWho goes, I'm going, hey, hey babe, check this out.\n\n43:23.460 --> 43:25.460\nI'm going to jump a foot and a half.\n\n43:26.460 --> 43:27.780\nI got this.\n\n43:27.780 --> 43:32.220\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

the Chipotle are stuck.\n\n43:47.060 --> 43:48.140\nThey punch through the wall.\n\n43:48.140 --> 43:49.620\nThey get him out.\n\n43:49.620 --> 43:52.040\nAnd he probably just looked at him and was like,\n\n43:52.040 --> 43:53.220\nSo can I call you again?\n\n43:53.220 --> 43:54.140\nHe must've did not have any.\n\n43:55.420 --> 43:57.340\nI know you're going to punch through the wall\n\n43:57.340 --> 44:00.780\nbut could I get like a number five?\n\n44:00.780 --> 44:01.620\nAnd some chips.\n\n44:01.620 --> 44:06.660\nthey punched through the wall and it was the wall of the one of the two buildings was a bank and\n\n44:06.660 --> 44:11.540\nhe bolted through and took all the money and ran away that would be the biggest like the greatest\n\n44:11.540 --> 44:21.780\nheist ever the Thomas crown affair the tinder heist of 2016 I mean I feel bad for that guy because\n\n44:21.780 --> 44:25.860\nnumber one he didn't he's not doing something stupid in the beginning he's it's a foot and a\n\n44:25.860 --> 44:32.580\nhalf so yeah so he's he's as dumb as any of us I got it he's just very lucky I just want the audio\n\n44:32.580 --> 44:45.620\nfor it hey hey baby let me show you something just fingernails coming down how long how long\n\n44:45.620 --> 44:57.380\nof a fall was it like a couple it was a few stories I know it wasn't like it wasn't like it was just\n\n44:57.380 --> 45:11.540\nmagic stories like that what is the appeal to us is that the same as like watching intervention\n\n45:11.540 --> 45:16.180\nor hoarders or something like that where we just we just want to we just want to look down and not\n\n45:16.180 --> 45:24.660\nsee rock bottom we see another person I think you feel yes yes the top of one person at least\n\n45:24.660 --> 45:30.020\nbefore rock bottom yes I think you feel better about yourself but just to know and and sometimes\n\n45:30.020 --> 45:35.540\nwe try and justify everything that someone does in this situation I mean always like the best move\n\n45:35.540 --> 45:41.700\nwhenever which is a healthy exercise right totally like like trying to figure out is it the yeah I mean\n\n45:42.340 --> 45:49.780\nhumanity of someone like someone who shits in a pool and then goes into the house and goes into\n\n45:49.780 --> 45:55.700\nthe bed and sleeps with the six-year-old uh hey let's get into it let's try to figure out what\n\n45:55.700 --> 46:02.500\npositive thing first of all have you ever taken a shit that just makes you tired we've all been\n\n46:02.500 --> 46:10.820\nthere you walk out of there like did I just do a like a like a 3k or something I have no electrolytes\n\n46:10.820 --> 46:16.740\nanymore after that shit I need to lay down would you say sleep with a six year old do you mean\n\n46:16.740 --> 46:22.020\nno no none of that's just actually literally just go to bed in your bed just took a nap yeah just took\n\n46:22.020 --> 46:29.380\na nap lay down next to a different family's child and then the pair oh no and then the parents\n\n46:29.380 --> 46:34.500\nprotected him from the cops the cops came as like it's someone in here they're like no no we're\n\n46:34.500 --> 46:39.300\nall right like they were some reason protecting this guy we care about this person more I remember\n\n46:39.300 --> 46:46.100\nwe were at the cops come though because uh they reported a naked man with a machete oh then they\n\n46:46.100 --> 46:51.460\nfigured it out was pooping in their pool yeah machete you left out the machete it is it is\n\n46:51.460 --> 46:56.580\nFlorida it is Florida yeah it was Florida no but I just I remember back like just the parents\n\n46:56.580 --> 47:01.060\nnot wanting to like involve this I don't know what they were trying to do they're like we can handle\n\n47:01.060 --> 47:04.820\nhis son as well we don't trust the cops or whatever well you can't discount human empathy I mean\n\n47:04.820 --> 47:09.220\nthey must they looked into his eyes when he woke up and we're just like he's a human being and then\n\n47:09.220 --> 47:13.780\nthey looked into the cops eyes when the cops showed up and they're like this guy's dead yeah no human\n\n47:13.780 --> 47:19.460\nbut but I like to shit in my pool if you shit in my pool no I like to think that it's like they\n\n47:19.460 --> 47:24.100\ndidn't know about the turd yeah exactly when they were sticking up from the cops they're like\n\n47:24.100 --> 47:28.100\nthey're like would you bring them mother fucker out here we're gonna take them away all right\n\n47:28.100 -->

the flow yeah no but I mean for the person doing the\n\n48:08.580 --> 48:14.100\nshitting like you're never immersed fully in water you take a shit yeah like that was probably\n\n48:14.100 --> 48:23.460\nyourself oh yes just that just so he was in the pool then he was in the pool I think he was in\n\n48:23.460 --> 48:29.540\nthe pool so he got into this bed where yeah well he probably dried

50:20.340\nfucking great I hope he fucking listens to this Keith Longinette he no he's dead he's probably\n\n50:20.340 --> 50:26.660\ndead right now he the Longinette family was brutally massed by a man with a machete you\n\n50:26.660 --> 50:34.180\nshit in their pool yeah Keith Longinette claimed to us that and there is no proof of this no\n\n50:34.180 --> 50:41.300\nbut we had to just agree with him that he kicked the longest field goal in Missouri state class\n\n50:41.300 --> 50:47.860\n5a high school football history and just told us every time he saw that's what he did that to me\n\n50:47.860 --> 50:53.940\nis like that I don't think people hold on to shit out here like that that is just an unbelievable\n\n50:53.940 --> 50:58.260\ncredit and an unbelievable thing there's an amazing book by Jonathan Franzen that he wrote\n\n50:58.260 --> 51:03.220\nbefore the corrections called the 27th city I don't know if you read that it's about St. Louis\n\n51:03.220 --> 51:11.940\nit's amazing amazing amazing are you just saying that yes okay it's it's an incredible book it pretty\n\n51:11.940 --> 51:17.620\nmuch nails the city in every way shape form but I do I actually say I do love that did you like\n\n51:17.620 --> 51:21.620\ngrowing up there you probably did I like growing up in you city I didn't like St. Louis right you\n\n51:21.620 --> 51:27.220\ncity was like racist yeah it's pretty racist but you said he was like mostly Jewish a lot of black\n\n51:27.220 --> 51:32.900\nfamilies a lot of multiracial families tons of culture it's the city that they recently vandalized\n\n51:32.900 --> 51:39.540\nwhen you see in the national news that that cemetery our family our family is buried in that\n\n51:39.540 --> 51:44.580\ncemetery um so that part was dope because it was great to grow up with like another culture\n\n51:44.580 --> 51:48.740\nbut the rest of St. Louis what are you saying the part that our family was in the cemetery that\n\n51:48.740 --> 51:54.100\nwas vandalized was dope because you guys don't really make the news right I was like how dope is\n\n51:54.100 --> 51:59.540\nthat shit right right there had been a black cemetery but they used it they you know they put\n\n51:59.540 --> 52:04.980\nan airport over it yeah it did not make the news like this shit but but still it was dope that\n\n52:04.980 --> 52:13.300\nyour people thank you I can't over yeah get on the mouth thanks man very twisted relationship\n\n52:13.300 --> 52:17.860\nthat this country has with I'm not going to blow your mind with this with Judaism with\n\n52:18.580 --> 52:24.500\nI'd say like like conservatives love the fuck out of Israel it's unreal get enough Israel because\n\n52:24.500 --> 52:28.740\nthey think of it as like a football team like like like we love Israel we love Israel's like\n\n52:28.740 --> 52:33.380\nthis great like amazing like like the Alabama Crimson time yeah like don't fuck with Israel\n\n52:33.380 --> 52:38.500\nand they're and anyone that's like chest puffed up and patriotic is kind of right to think that\n\n52:38.500 --> 52:43.060\nway I guess because they have great recruiting they're I mean they're they're a they're a fucking like\n\n52:43.060 --> 52:48.100\nthe colors are great but but blue and the white the lighters are kind of those people reconcile\n\n52:48.100 --> 52:53.380\nthey're fucking blatant anti-semitism I mean they they they really go ahead Jay you can talk deeply\n\n52:53.380 --> 52:58.980\nabout this wow how I don't know you just know people close yeah I there are people in my family\n\n52:58.980 --> 53:04.500\nI'm not going to call them out but uh that my family not Randy's family that are that are\n\n53:04.500 --> 53:12.100\nare conservative and because of Israel and I just want to be like it's not like if anyone\n\n53:12.100 --> 53:16.020\nelse is there they're not going to shit on Israel they might call Israel on some stuff\n\n53:16.020 --> 53:21.060\nbut they're not going to shit on Israel Israel's like a good restaurant in like a weird rough\n\n53:21.060 --> 53:25.540\nneighborhood all right they're not the city's not going to suddenly come in and be like close this\n\n53:25.540 --> 53:31.620\nshit down we need it it's good it's like there there's a lot of good that comes out of it so\n\n53:31.620 --> 53:37.940\nit's a very odd it's a very odd relationship because that happens I think the I think there's no way\n\n53:37.940 --> 53:42.500\ndesecration of of a Jewish cemetery has not happened in even in the Bush administration\n\n53:42.500 --> 53:47.060\nI think it's completely because sorry I didn't mean to make take the derail this yeah by the way\n\n53:47.060 --> 53:52.100\nno this is the part of the show where but no but I do I do think it's because Trump is like\n\n53:52.100 --> 53:57.860\noh Steve Bannon come on in and so now anyone who has like aligned feelings like that they don't\n\n53:57.860 --> 54:00.900\nfeel like there's going to be any consequences for what they're doing so now like more and more\n\n54:00.900 --> 54:05.460\nJewish community centers are being threatened more and more you know the cemetery dude I Steve Bannon\n\n54:05.460 --> 54:10.020\nscares the fuck out of me I'll be like about to pick my daughter up from ballet and I'm standing\n\n54:10.020 --> 54:13.460\noutside the Jewish community center in Silver Lake where she takes ballet and I'll just be in the\n\n54:13.460 --> 54:17.140\nparking lot I'm like people are picking up their kids and my wife will call me be like\n\n54:17.140 --> 54:20.660\ndo you hear what Steve Bannon did I'm like no what the fuck did Steve Bannon do I'm in the\n\n54:20.660 --> 54:25.300\nparking lot I'm like Payser what the fuck did what the fuck did Steve Bannon do hun it's like no he\n\n54:25.300 --> 54:29.700\nthinks there's going to be this is like the fourth revolution and he wants a fucking civil war and he\n\n54:29.700 --> 54:32.740\nwants everyone to fucking kill each other so we I don't know how he's gonna make no I'm goddamn\n\n54:32.740 --> 54:39.700\nterrified and I'm a wasp I am a goy whatever you call me I'm a fucking whatever I am I'm a blob of\n\n54:39.700 --> 54:47.940\nthe fucking white you're just white white person I because every time every every it's it's it I've\n\n54:47.940 --> 54:52.340\nboiled it down I'm focused I'm focusing on my own emotional reactions yeah like I bought a gun\n\n54:52.980 --> 54:56.500\nfor the 10-day waiting period and I haven't picked it up yet yeah I picked it up so it's\n\n54:56.500 --> 55:01.700\nstill there distracted by that so it's like Dylan's Nobel Prize but then I left it there but\n\n55:01.700 --> 55:06.820\nyesterday I was like I'm gonna go pick it up the article I read that's that made me want to go pick\n\n55:06.820 --> 55:13.060\nit up was it was it was it was this the with a barred the CNN from the thing I know for me it's\n\n55:13.060 --> 55:18.340\nabout First Amendment because I perceive Steve Bannon and that whole plan I don't know what\n\n55:18.340 --> 55:22.500\nthose guys the Nazi part of Trump and there's a huge Nazi part of him he's descended from the\n\n55:22.500 --> 55:29.300\nfucking that his brother in the um the the those guys are the only fortunate thing is that they're\n\n55:29.300 --> 55:35.060\nnot upgrading their playbook they didn't update it for the internet it includes I look at this all\n\n55:35.060 --> 55:41.060\nthis First Amendment stuff every time there's talk about laws against protesting that's fucking\n\n55:41.060 --> 55:57.140\nJesus Christ I'm sorry I didn't put it on side I'm sorry please continue that that ring tone does not match your voice at all uh just really delicate wind chimes\n\n55:58.740 --> 56:05.460\ndidn't he just tell you he has a gun he has not picked it up Dan what are the other three\n\n56:05.460 --> 56:12.980\nerrands you're gonna do around the gun pickup I gotta go to Trader Joe's I gotta drop off this box\n\n56:12.980 --> 56:18.100\nat uh boss brother's gotta go pick up your gun go pick up a gun finding out you gotta get some\n\n56:18.100 --> 56:22.740\nporn too just to balance that shit out I'm using it to measure what what I'm feeling and when and\n\n56:22.740 --> 56:28.020\nwhat my triggers are what's going on with me because um because we're all finding out like okay we need\n\n56:28.020 --> 56:32.420\nto take this seriously how our perspectives are different how how our neurologies are different\n\n56:32.420 --> 56:38.100\num I for me every time this First Amendment stuff comes up particularly this idea of the\n\n56:38.100 --> 56:44.180\npress as the enemy and all this stuff I perceive it as those guys like that's the velociraptors\n\n56:44.180 --> 56:51.220\ntesting the fucking electric cages because they and or they're just piling up the zombies piling up\n\n56:51.220 --> 56:57.140\nagainst the the the the shopping mall doors and dawn of the dead like they if they could get thicker\n\n56:57.140 --> 57:02.980\nand push it down they would they because there's a Nazi playbook and it and there's a there's a\n\n57:02.980 --> 57:08.900\nfascist playbook get rid of the media playbook the media you can't go any further you cannot\n\n57:08.900 --> 57:13.620\ncontinue past well they'll get rid of the media whether they can or not by saying this is alternative\n\n57:13.620 --> 57:17.620\nfacts this is not truth and there are people that fake news fake news they're going to contribute\n\n57:17.620 --> 57:23.060\nit's yes it's fake news yeah lugen press it's straight out of the english translation of\n\n57:23.060 --> 57:28.500\nfucking nazi terminology this is that's what they do if in the 30s it took six guys and a\n\n57:28.500 --> 57:33.940\npair of boots to go shut down the media you tipped over a fucking press and you and you set fire\n\n57:33.940 --> 57:40.260\nto a building um the they're doing the equivalent of that and that's that makes me it's their intent\n\n57:40.260 --> 57:45.060\nyou know like when a kid hits you in the nuts as hard as he can with a bat and you're like it's\n\n57:45.060 --> 57:50.180\ndisturbing to you it's like there's it's separate from whether or not it hurt it's like the kid\n\n57:50.180 --> 57:55.220\nthought that he was gonna fucking hit your nuts as hard as he could with what he thinks is the\n\n57:55.220 --> 58:01.380\nbiggest weapon he has in his hand and there's an offense there where you go nephew cousin whoever\n\n58:01.380 --> 58:07.300\nyou are you know the fuck nuts like wait wait you don't don't do that you know those are my\n\n58:07.300 --> 58:12.500\nnuts and that's a bat um and it doesn't really matter how clownishly ineffective they've been\n\n58:12.500 --> 58:18.500\nit's the fact that what they would have when you see their intent when you see when you look into\n\n58:18.500 --> 58:24.020\ntheir dead eyes and see what they would see the future be would you see that's what that's why\n\n58:24.020 --> 58:29.460\nthese policies are important because like they don't fucking care so another parent told me that\n\n58:29.460 --> 58:34.020\nthe other day that they uh trump was on the tv and their like two-year-old kid pointed and went\n\n58:34.020 --> 58:40.500\ntrump like with this just sad like the same way you would like because he's like grimace from\n\n58:40.500 --> 58:45.220\nmcdonald lander the hamburger you know it's like like the kids are learning the mythology he's not\n\n58:45.220 --> 58:52.180\na good guy like you know i can't say it i mean there's just hatred there's just uh it's 9 11\n\n58:52.180 --> 59:01.380\nno it's not not by our clock uh we go by a really specific clock here uh anyway but but i was\n\n59:02.340 --> 59:07.780\nlook i mean i there is this it's not a silver lining it's not like and i know that i know\n\n59:07.780 --> 59:11.860\ntwo years from now four years around what is the silver lining what is the silver lining with any\n\n59:11.860 --> 59:16.660\ncrisis is always that you know it's like a forest fire it's like the silver lining with a zit getting\n\n59:16.660 --> 59:21.780\nso fucking gigantic that you can't ignore it the silver lining is that it's ready to burst um it's\n\n59:21.780 --> 59:27.860\nbut it's it's the the when those graveyards got desecrated you know one of the things that i saw\n\n59:27.860 --> 59:34.020\nwas a muslim group muslim group saying like hey what can we get to like you know it's it's it's\n\n59:34.020 --> 59:40.500\nthe shit coming out into the open like where the funny smart progressive decent people have nothing\n\n59:40.500 --> 59:46.980\nto fear in the light and and only the bad people will they will they will continue to be more and\n\n59:46.980 --> 59:51.860\nmore recognizable because they will continue to advocate for shadow and darkness they will continue\n\n59:51.860 --> 59:56.420\nto say uh everything should be secret everything there there should be boundaries there should\n\n59:56.420 --> 01:00:00.820\nbe borders there should be all these things and that is going to be that could be a really healthy\n\n01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:07.700\nthing for admittedly a side of the political spectrum that that in times of peace and prosperity\n\n01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:14.580\ndid nothing but someone brought their their chihuahua hey just sat on a duck that's fine that's good\n\n01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:19.860\nwait you don't think the silver lining is that everyone who voted for trump who\n\n01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:23.060\nbelieved that their life was going to get better their life because he doesn't give a\n\n01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:28.420\nshit about them gets so much worse that and they lose their health carry and they see that there\n\n01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:31.940\nis no way they lose their money lose their money and they see there's no way out but to commit\n\n01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:38.180\nsuicide that entire dies and then we lose those fucking people voting in the next election\n\n01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:45.860\nwho yeah that's called natural levelers called fucking that's human gerrymandering that's right\n\n01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:50.260\nwe draw a different wait did you did you see recently uh we talked about this on our other\n\n01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:55.620\npodcast that uh Arnold Schwarzenegger just in a random tweet did you see this that he was like\n\n01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:02.180\nit's amazing that like when congress is less popular than like oh herpes herpes and nickleback\n\n01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:07.780\nlike he dragged nickleback was like whoa whoa you don't fuck with like you fuck with the nickle you\n\n01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:14.180\nget the back and they came back so hard on him and they tweeted back at him like leave us out of\n\n01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:18.900\nyour stuff and they went after him and then he apologized like immediately look i was i was going\n\n01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:23.700\nfor unity uh totally and i was like wait i thought you're supposed to be a tough guy you're a tough\n\n01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:28.980\nrepublic yeah come on man what the fuck dude i i i thought that was a strange situation because i\n\n01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:34.500\nsaw that video and i thought it was a really important primer or alert to the concept of gerrymandering\n\n01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:39.140\nwhich we don't talk enough about totally but it was Arnold Schwarzenegger i know i didn't\n\n01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:43.860\nretweet it because it was too i didn't want to deal with the i don't want to feel like some\n\n01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:49.220\ncome on dad let's go motorcycle riding and i mean he was you can retweet some more of my stuff\n\n01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:54.660\nwoman gropin republicans sell out also as as a republican he cut the first people who went after\n\n01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:58.900\nin california with the nurses and the teachers yeah i i just like he's just another glory hat so\n\n01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:02.980\nit's it would it would have distracted from the message but it was a good message like we need\n\n01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:08.500\nto talk about gerrymandering yeah i agree and i love that nickleback though came back to me if\n\n01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:13.220\nthat was huber snake they just would have retweeted it so like hey fuck we're in a we're in a tweet\n\n01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:20.740\ngood friend he said they should have gone to huber snake god fucking dammit just to hear him say\n\n01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.020\nonly in the app store\n\n01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:35.940\nonly in the app store only in the app store what it what it could be me me me what if billy bob and\n\n01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:46.980\narnold like just tweeted to each other i think it would go a little something like this would you\n\n01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:55.780\nask you ask tom pettie what was in the app store i would ask him only what's in the app store\n\n01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:03.460\nthat would be it but it just guys touch out like remember that video do you remember the video\n\n01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:09.380\nafter trump like uh trump trump at the prayer breakfast was like well and you should pray for\n\n01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:13.460\nschwarzenegger's ratings and then and then schwarzenegger released this video going like\n\n01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:18.900\nhey donald how about this and it was like like like the the swirling things that go through your\n\n01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:23.940\nhead are like well first of all okay so now we're just the wcw or whatever it's like like like like\n\n01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:28.740\nare these guys all with worse actors like the only thing missing is mean gene green like like\n\n01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:33.460\ngoing like between them is that what they want but then the but then the other thing you go is\n\n01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:40.820\nlike god damn it now i love arnold again because because it's like it that like charisma and empathy\n\n01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:45.860\nand just faces and heads on screens is what we're so subject to and that is the whole problem we\n\n01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:51.700\ngot to get away from that like he groped at your heartstrings he cornered them in an elevator\n\n01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:58.900\nand exactly he's he's and now he's paying for the baby that the two of you know there's too many that's\n\n01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:03.380\nwe're primates so we look at each other and sometimes the different people have different\n\n01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:09.300\nlike uh effects on us and we gotta actually we gotta grow we gotta outgrow that i'm a writer i\n\n01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:14.420\nknow all about like the need for heroes that we have but that's a biological impulse so is taking\n\n01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:19.620\na shit we do that in a toilet when we elect our leaders we need to have we need to like overcome\n\n01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:26.340\nour urges and our urges are for like barrel-chested leaders who are smarter and more capable than\n\n01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:31.700\nus and john wane this and all the stuff and like the the the democrats need to lead the charge i\n\n01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:36.260\nthink i'm just being like this is not a human concept this is not an individualistic concept\n\n01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:42.340\nthe idea of leading 300 million people uh and then by proxy eight eight billion people i think alec\n\n01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:46.740\nball one should be our next person and he should just go back in the face of my theory well i know\n\n01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:51.300\nbut it's the only way we get it's the only way to go but it's almost like in the wake of our you\n\n01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:57.540\nknow like like those the old european countries that do still have like england like they have\n\n01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:03.140\nalthough they fucked up the brexit they really did we need to have we should have this popularity\n\n01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:08.260\ncontest where we have a symbolic leader of this guy's taking his head so oh you must be british\n\n01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:14.100\nright no you say we already have it it's the Kardashians uh you seem that concerned that that\n\n01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:18.420\nif no one argues with me we're gonna revert to monarchy that's the mother fucker man yeah it's\n\n01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:23.460\na bad impulse it's a bad impulse like the the idea of a monarchy being necessary well okay of course\n\n01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:28.260\nbut not a monarchy it wouldn't be a necessary monarchy it would be a symbolic one the king\n\n01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:34.100\nand the queen there is yeah they don't do anything they are though they satiate and urge people have\n\n01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:39.540\nto go visit a museum and look at a fancy hat and say oh we're the best she's running shit there\n\n01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:44.340\nthere is there is this great but seriously there's this great thing where they hide it and they're like\n\n01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:48.980\nno the queen doesn't have any power she's got a ton of fucking power parliament doesn't convene unless\n\n01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:56.100\nshe speaks so don't trip they're still in they're still in some crazy ass move i want to assure you\n\n01:05:56.100 --> 01:06:01.940\nguys i was not tripping i was not what he was tripping out there but everybody want to say the\n\n01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:08.420\nqueen is not complicit but she complicit that's the fact that we would be adding one it wouldn't\n\n01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:13.300\nbe a powerful office we would be adding no this is that's really what we're supposed to have already\n\n01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:20.180\ndone we're supposed to let elected representatives and officials do some of the the grunt work and\n\n01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:24.180\nwe're supposed to take care of each other we're in this position now because we keep trying to hire\n\n01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:29.300\npeople to take us out of this position in a true american sense where we're like i want to send my\n\n01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:33.940\ncongressman up there to get you health care when the reality of the situation is how do we\n\n01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:38.340\nbend together none of this shit would happen in the first place it's not democrats republicans this\n\n01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:46.740\nshit is on that's true when did this become like go ahead and applaud yeah that's true but it's also\n\n01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:53.220\nisn't it like an american tradition and right the idea that that's fucking grunt work it's civil\n\n01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:58.580\nservice like go represent me on capitol hill i have potatoes to farm but they really want to do it\n\n01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:02.980\nwhen you talk to a congressman when you talk to a politician they actually really do give a fuck\n\n01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:08.980\nnight not not all of a lot of them do but but a ton of them are like hey man my calling was\n\n01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:14.100\nbuilding neighborhoods my calling was figuring out a way right well so we need to put like maybe if\n\n01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:20.580\neach of us put 10 percent more of our day into the being represented part of representation\n\n01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:26.020\ni'm saying you could you could actually take your power back if you paid attention to what was going\n\n01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:32.740\non just one block over just one block over don't don't have to become an alderman don't have to\n\n01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:37.140\nbecome the mayor of your city but take the block to the left or take the block to the right and if\n\n01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:42.420\neverybody on a block did that shit yeah we'd be way better off than what we needed our elected\n\n01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:46.740\nrepresentatives to do it probably is a good time to bring up this thing that we're like you guys\n\n01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:50.740\nheard of this indivisible thing we talked about it i think last week maybe but but like there's\n\n01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:56.180\nthis thing online it's kind of a guidebook for what we're talking it includes that the idea that\n\n01:07:56.180 --> 01:08:00.900\nthe sad thing is that it's sort of taking a lot of pages from the tea parties playbook because\n\n01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:07.060\nit's observing the fact that a small but passionate group of people that were filled with hatred and\n\n01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:11.700\nhad their heart in the wrong place still managed political efficacy just by working on a local\n\n01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:16.500\nlevel they showed up in droves at town halls into this shit so you can tell this this indivisible\n\n01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:20.820\nplaybook and if you just google it like there's an audiobook that's like an hour long that reads\n\n01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:24.980\nthrough it in your car don't listen to this episode i give you permission to spend that\n\n01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:31.380\nhour listening to this thing it just wait whoa whoa whoa don't listen to the second hour\n\n01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:38.100\nbut but it's like it basically just says that i mean i like listen you know it's like it's like\n\n01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:44.740\nif there's if there's not 20 people within a certain block radius of you that are that have\n\n01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:50.900\nstarted something start started and here's how we know that's how gentrification worked\n\n01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:55.380\nwas that people called the cops once they moved to neighborhoods that had crime people called\n\n01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:59.700\ntheir friends and and had a visible presence in that neighborhood so we know that it works for\n\n01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:03.860\nreal estate prices the same thing could would work for each one of us trying to take it works\n\n01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:09.620\nfor the school it works for schools too uh both of us sent our kids to public schools here and one\n\n01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:12.740\nof the reasons why the public schools in our neighborhood are good is because the parents\n\n01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:18.100\nare fucking involved it's that simple that's it that's the end of it teachers can only do so much\n\n01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:22.500\nthey we have the same shitty classrooms and the shitty chairs that every other school has in the\n\n01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:27.860\ncity but our parents will go out in the community and raise a bunch of fucking money and put it\n\n01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:31.780\nin and be like we don't want the music teacher one day a week we gotta raise this class this fight\n\n01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:38.420\nbut a great role it is to be okay with it is it is i'm gonna argue that charter because people say\n\n01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:42.900\ncharter well this is a charter this is not charter this is public public okay it's a wonderful thing\n\n01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:46.900\nthat we can all bring the most money to the picnic and then look over at the other side of the park\n\n01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:51.460\nand see motherfucker star true but i'm not knocking that what we should have been doing was passing\n\n01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:57.380\nlegislation so that all california schools got completely agree completely agree or tax weed\n\n01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:01.780\nand we know that that's the thing we know people aren't people aren't fucking with this\n\n01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:07.780\nfuck a bandit bandit can't fuck you up now really the truth is we we kind of let ourselves down\n\n01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:12.820\nthey can't i think they could really here's the bottom line you you know that churches maybe you\n\n01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:17.700\ndon't but the churches are already coming up with safe houses maybe we got to go back to the the\n\n01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:21.380\ndays of abolition where the quakers had to hide the slaves and we got to hide people who have come\n\n01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:25.540\nto this country i don't say illegal maybe that's what

your kid is probably experienced i think\n\n01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:40.580\nshe's empirically oh my god she's mesmerizingly beautiful she's still beautiful we got to do a\n\n01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:46.420\nscene with her in uh like csi or whatever we did with her she was still beautiful and the whole\n\n01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:52.420\ntime you know i yeah i that that that movie like like like like that that character coming on screen\n\n01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:57.860\nit's like i that would that launched a thousand chips i mean it did it was like it wasn't ralph machio\n\n01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:03.380\nwe were enamored with no we identified with him and waxed on and waxed off with him but what's\n\n01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:08.580\noff to her you wanted elizabeth shoe and she was like like that was the 80s and it's\n\n01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:12.900\nfucking most perfect he was like like like with the with the with the sweaters and the little barrette\n\n01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:18.500\nand the all right perfect perfect or do you watch that movie again though it's like she she plays\n\n01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:24.900\nlike 25 and he plays 14 and meanwhile he was 22 when they did it and everyone was like in high school\n\n01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:31.060\nuh but what do you so so but this is the thing because this dad that told me about that story\n\n01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:35.700\nhe's like oh okay he looks at the search history for china and like and i've heard this parents\n\n01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:39.460\nover and over and over again all the stories the stand-ups and things telling stories like\n\n01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:42.980\noh they're walking and their kids on youtube and they're they've googled things and they're looking\n\n01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:48.500\nat things and it's time to it's like this ambush where it's time to have this weird talk with your\n\n01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:56.420\nkid about and all of these stories end with this sort of like and so i said uh this and that and\n\n01:20:56.420 --> 01:21:01.220\nsometimes the parents is the hero of the story because they said something so fucking weirdly\n\n01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:06.020\nlike navigating all these highway cones but that's as good as it gets it it's like there is no healthy\n\n01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:11.380\nlike we have all of these like uh toxic ways we have all these ways that we worry about our kids\n\n01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:17.300\nlearning about sex we don't have any ways that we look forward to it we have demonized it i want\n\n01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:22.020\nit to be awkward i want it to be as awkward as possible like as stand-ups i think in life or\n\n01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:27.220\njust as people who look at life and try and create you want the most if it goes smoothly if it goes\n\n01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:31.620\nreally smoothly that's great then the then your life is good if it don't you think we need as a\n\n01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:38.100\nsociety to adopt some kind of standard i think we have the most fucked up attitudes towards death\n\n01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:43.140\nand loss and like yeah we're all fucked up that's all diy every step of the way wiping your ass\n\n01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:47.380\nshowering like yeah i didn't really everyone should have a bidet i mean but that's starting\n\n01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:54.500\nin another point but like controversial right guys i'll lay that shit down hey but i mean i just\n\n01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.700\nthink like we have a lot there are a lot of things that need to be changed but definitely the sex\n\n01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:02.260\ntalk and the way we look at it there's a there are puritanical underpinnings and when we grew up in\n\n01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:06.660\nst louis i don't know if you felt it too i felt like it was more constricted to the bible like\n\n01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:13.220\nwe go and spend time in cities like denver seattle san francisco that the overall attitude of the\n\n01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:19.140\npeople who live there it's like way way way fucking more open about everything where we grow in\n\n01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:24.580\nst louis i feel like the puritanical underpinnings of sex made it something that is wrong and you\n\n01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:29.140\nshould not do and so you're at least not talk about yeah don't talk about so if you were like the\n\n01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:34.500\nonly black dude it was rough because everybody would experiment with you puritanically that's\n\n01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:47.060\nright it's just taboo so fucking taboo i miss the racism of sex this is this is the good side of\n\n01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:52.580\nprohibition yeah that's everybody's still got drunk we've had i seem to remember we've had we've\n\n01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:59.620\nhad women up on this stage who have really uh that's true a golden age of the podcast i remember i\n\n01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:03.380\nremember a young lady coming up and telling the story about when she was in high school she was\n\n01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:09.540\nsort of you know it's a classic story and like the the the movies that we don't she was branded a\n\n01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:20.340\nuh a slut essentially like like because she like she was the uh participant in early experiences\n\n01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:25.780\nof other shitheads that then punished her for that it's like it wasn't like she went out with a\n\n01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:32.180\nsandwich board and said let's do this um you know she simply was the person that or maybe she fucking\n\n01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:38.420\nenjoyed it uh did not she came on the show and said oh she did not enjoy it okay no she enjoyed it\n\n01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:42.580\nfine she did not enjoy the slut label i'm not saying she enjoyed yeah maybe she just enjoyed the\n\n01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:47.620\nexperiences themselves and she should be allowed to yes i mean you're not taking a brave stance there\n\n01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:59.620\nwe're all no jesus women should enjoy sex right am i right ladies guys no i'm sorry i jumped off\n\n01:23:59.620 -->

young people's sexuality uh over and over again\n\n01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:22.180\nbecause it does become a civic matter it becomes a legal matter if some kid didn't understand the\n\n01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:27.300\ndifference between consent and not and that's that that becomes a criminal legal matter it becomes\n\n01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:32.660\nall of our problem so we're still living in this weird time when we're like oh let my kid learn\n\n01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:39.700\nabout sex like however they want like whoa who would who would want some obama uh panel telling\n\n01:24:39.700 -->

discussion where they\n\n01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:34.740\nwere like they were really my son was like that today when i was like when we heard some of the\n\n01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:37.780\nbad language and he was like i was like why do you want me out of the room he's like because\n\n01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:40.820\nyou're going to hear something bad you're going to make me turn it off i was like i'm

it's not i'm like you could actually some kid some fucking douchebag kid\n\n01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:56.660\nand there are douchebag kids all over these three fucking kids all right so there are these douchebag\n\n01:28:56.660 --> 01:29:03.300\nkids in our neighborhood and one of them got mad at my son and for some bullshit thing and yelled\n\n01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:08.500\nat him really loud and my son came in the house and i didn't think he knew he was like that mother\n\n01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:16.820\nfucking piece of shit and i was like you i was so proud in a weird way that he knew that well\n\n01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:21.700\nhere's why i was proud i was like oh my god he knows these words and he knows not to throw him\n\n01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:26.820\naround at school or in moments where it's not appropriate and this was like he was reaching\n\n01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:30.420\nfor the worst thing he could say about someone and then he had these in his cachet and i was like\n\n01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:36.180\nthat's cool i thought that was very cool so like there is a way i guess that yeah bitch he does suck\n\n01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:43.540\nbut that's the way to like i guess that's this kind of example of like allowing them a little bit\n\n01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:48.180\nof control in this scenario because i think going the other way where you're trying parenting you're\n\n01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:52.420\ngoing to do 80% wrong you're going to feel like you're doing 80% of what you're doing wrong even\n\n01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:56.820\nthough you're trying to do everything right yeah i'm not i would never be really hypocritical of\n\n01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:05.380\nme to say some of it shouldn't be upon us we have we have an alphabet we have insulin we have we
