00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Oh, man. Hello, everybody. Welcome. Harmontown is now in session.

00:11.000 --> 00:21.000
Let's hear it. Come on. Welcome to the back of Miltdown Comics.

00:21.000 --> 00:32.000
Let's bring out Spencer. Spencer. Spencer, right here. I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Rob Schrab.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000
I will be controlling in the place of Jeff Davis, who could not be here tonight.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
How y'all feeling tonight? You everybody feeling good?

00:42.000 --> 00:51.000
Alright, let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Sit down. Sit down.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
Yay. It's 8.12.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
I don't know. Now explain that.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
When you were in the bathroom at El Compadre, Rob shot me a mischievous look.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
I said, now, Rob, that's not a normal man's look. You've got something cooking up right in your mind right now.

01:41.000 --> 01:50.000
And what did you say, Rob? Well, basically, just he suggested that we do what you just saw happen.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Like, what did you? You tweeted them?

01:55.000 --> 02:02.000
I didn't tweet shit, man. I've been on Twitter since Bill Paxton died.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
We lost Bill Paxton.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
I'm really bummed out about that. Who's really bummed out about that?

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
It's over, man.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Some people make fun of it.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
I'm pretty sad about it.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
Same Game Over Man is definitely trivializing a human being's death, I would say.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
I got a lot of misguided people when Harold Ramis died, like, oh, he's seeing Vinkman on the other side now.

02:26.000 --> 02:34.000
It's like, don't do the thing where you relate their death to their product.

02:34.000 --> 02:41.000
I don't think. Not when you're genuinely trying to eulogize. Do it in the privacy of your own bedroom.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
When did you find out?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I don't know, this morning, I guess.

02:46.000 --> 02:57.000
It just hit me. It was like, one of those guys that you think is going to be around forever, and he's just gone.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
It's like Miguel Ferrer died earlier this year.

03:00.000 --> 03:09.000
And we also recently lost Milo Yiannopoulos.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
You don't know when it's going to happen.

03:13.000 --> 03:24.000
Somebody will be complicated in surgery, somebody will dig up a year old interview where you sound a little bit like you're alright with pedophilia, and then you're just gone.

03:24.000 --> 03:37.000
I want to really just congratulate Simon and Schuster. They really went on a limb there to cancel a book deal after rediscovering someone's highly publicized remarks on pedophilia.

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
I think the second time it became publicized, it was really just the right thing to do at the time.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
Oh, wait, now that's going to be unprofitable pedophilia?

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
All right, well, we thought it was one of those one times.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
It's too bad because he's such a nice, likable person.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
Well, as he would always explain, he was just being funny.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
He was just very funny. He was just a very funny person, he would always say.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
I think the funniest thing about him was how he would continually talk over anyone who'd show he was odd.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
He had no basic improv training. He would not give and take.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
No matter what show he was on, you would just be hearing him talking over anyone that was always talking.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
Not a funny person and not a talented person, just a tragic attention whore.

04:30.000 --> 04:41.000
That's fine. The thing is, I find the irony to be, as soon as Breitbart lost him, whether he quit or got fired,

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
and then I watched the Joe Rogan thing where he was talking about getting fucked by his priest or whatever,

04:46.000 --> 04:54.000
and it was like, I think the interesting thing about the left versus the right is that the left would like to hear about your bullshit

04:54.000 --> 05:11.000
after we know it's related to human trauma, and the right would like to hear about it right up until that time.

05:11.000 --> 05:19.000
$5 gets you the video subscription to Harmontown. See what Rob Schrab is doing.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
I'm not going to try to do a regular show tonight.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
It's the Oscars. The Oscars are on right now.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
The Oscars are...

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Who's one?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Lala Land.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Who's two?

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Suicide Squad.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
Lala Land can suck-suck my dick-dick.

05:45.000 --> 05:53.000
And it can, too.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
What is this concoction, somebody?

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
That's Frank Branca. That's what Jeff user drinks.

06:03.000 --> 06:11.000
I feel like reanimator, man.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
My thoughts on Milo are very cogent and timely, and now they're lost to the ages.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
How you doing, Dan? I haven't seen you in a while.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
We discovered some new planets, Rob.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Okay.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Have they been named yet?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
No.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
How many planets?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
I don't know.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Let's name them.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
I don't know. I don't know anything that you don't know. NASA said on Monday,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
we got some shit coming out that on Wednesday, they were like,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
here's the thing, there's some things.

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
All I was getting at third hand, there was a solar system that has multiple Earth-like planets.

06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
There's seven new Earth-like exoplanets or something revolving around a single-star solar system.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Only one star?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Imagine if these...

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
How many moons?

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Imagine if these planets are actually...

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
You've got to figure, before we could ever even...

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Before we had gasoline, before we had electricity, we had telescopes,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
we could see what was going on on the moon.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
So if these planets are... Let's say they all have sentient life evolving on them.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Sure.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
We would be making first contact with people.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
Most importantly, even if they weren't technologically more advanced than us,

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
they would already be, if they had telescopic contact with each other,

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
they would already be like the New York to our Wyoming.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
Because they would have grown up, like in the year 1400,

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
they would have known there were fish people on the planet, like a couple of...

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
What if the fish people were like a hundred years behind us?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Or ahead of them, whatever. It doesn't matter.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
We will be making contact with a solar system that will be like,

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
why are you people so racist?

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
When we were getting to that point, we could see fish people waving at us.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
And we could also see them beating up snake people next to them.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
And we were monkey people next to giraffe people going like,

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
stop doing that.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
And they were like, you're right. You should stop doing that too. You're right.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
And then we're going to be so intimidated by them that we're going to be like,

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Not me.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
I think, I don't know, I just think it could be an ironic development

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
where we're like totally technologically the same,

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
but they're kind of snobby, like they're more cosmopolitan.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
And then we end up going like, they're looking down on us and going like,

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
you're still racist?

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
And we'll be like, yeah, that's right.

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
I hate this Mexican guy and he hates me because we're from Earth.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
I'm glad you let me get through the thought.

08:59.000 --> 09:16.000
All right, our guests tonight have a feral audio podcast

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
called Dumb People Town.

09:17.000 --> 09:27.000
Let's bring out the Sklar Brothers.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Thank you.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
Hey, Rob, did you get that tiny bottle of table wine we sent over to you?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
I did.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Oh, good.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Oh, great.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Great.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Somebody ate the tiny loaf of bread that came with it.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Chef's choice.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Okay.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
So let's get through the twin stuff for a second.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I thought you were going to talk about...

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Cover it finally.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Yeah, finally, let's crack that.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
I actually want to talk just briefly about the planet stuff.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Okay.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Because I always felt like Pluto got the rawest deal of all.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
It's like a planet for so...

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
We think we have job security problems.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
That shit was locked down for so long.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
That was diorama lockdown.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
That was diorama lockdown to then just be like, yep, you're not a planet anymore.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
To me, it feels like the rawest deal ever.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
What is it?

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
It's like, my very elegant mother just served us nine...

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Dwarf planets?

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
My very elegant mother just served us nothing.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
That's what it was.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
If you're Pluto...

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
I thought I saw some little sniglet about maybe Pluto now.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
It was a planet, then it wasn't a planet, and now it might be...

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
It was Dwarf planet for a while.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Then it was on Game of Thrones.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
Then now, wait, is Rich Hall still doing sniglets?

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
I co-opted the word sniglet to mean a little thing.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
A snippet?

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah, I don't know.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
An unresearched bot that injured my head.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
I thought I saw some little subhead that was always related to the NASA conference.

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
They found all these little exoplanets, but then there was also something attached to that,

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
a rider that was like, also Pluto might be a planet.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
P.S.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Am I imagining that?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
P.S., yeah, Pluto...

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I know, remember how all those people said Pluto wasn't a planet?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
It is actually now a planet.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
It is again.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
No, I don't know if that was just an attachment on the little planet.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
P.S.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
All right, we want to talk about twins?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Yeah, let's get into it.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Let's fucking get into it.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Bill Paxton, let's talk about Bill Paxton.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Is it the size or is it the distance from the sun?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
What is the issue?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
For twins?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
I don't know.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
How do you get your power?

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
We have to say equidistant from the sun or one of us dies.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
It's a very difficult thing to manage when we're not together.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Actually, I actually found out about Bill Paxton last week.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
What?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Yeah, my phone's got crazy alerts.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
It was unbelievable.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
I just seen the movie Arrival, so I can actually see into the creature now.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
See, you're trivializing a human being's death.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Hey, I just know I'm never getting lasik surgery.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
That's one thing I'll never do, because you died of complications from...

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
No, really?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
That's what it is?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
From lasik surgery?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
No, I made that up.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I totally made that up.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Wow.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
I thought it was because your glasses are the only way we could tell you from your brother.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Yeah, but really I have no heart.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
No soul.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Yeah, I was thinking I might watch a simple plan tonight.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
You guys like a simple...

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
So good.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
So fucking good.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Particularly liked Bill Paxton in that movie.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
He was great.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
He was great.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
And then Billy Bob Thornton, just nobody...

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
He's got the most powerful, like, quiet voice in all of movies.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
He just...

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
He says it so quietly.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
You ever see one false move with Bill Paxton and Billy Bob?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
No, I have not.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Really good.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Really, really good.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
It's the simple plan of movies.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
No.

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
Trying to do my Billy Bob Thornton impression.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
It's good.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Working hard.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
I like mashed potatoes.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
What else do you like Billy Bob?

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
I'm going to just start showing you objects.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Do you like tiny wine?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I like tobogganing.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
That goes well with mashed potatoes.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
What else?

13:26.000 --> 13:35.000
I like being questioned by Canadian interviewers about my band.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
What is he looking at?

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I don't know what Billy Bob is looking at.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
I'm focusing on...

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Just down on the floor.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
I have to focus all of my energy into my impersonation lobe.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
I love it.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
I'm not going to do a fucking awesome Billy Bob and then also be like,

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Who wants pizza?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
That's right.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Or make eye contact.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
Yeah, at the very least.

13:56.000 --> 14:03.000
I like mashed potatoes and gravy.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
See, it doesn't work.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
No, you went from zero eye contact to the creepiest,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I will never look away from you eye contact.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
He looked through Jason to me.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Like that's how.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Would you ask Tom Petty about his influences?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Yes.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah, I would.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
You've seen that Canadian clip, right?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Yes.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Fucking amazing.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
That's my favorite part.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Would you ask Tom Petty about his influences?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Yeah.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Pause, pause.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Yeah.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Of course.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
It's one of the first things I asked.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
What did you want to know?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Who are you influencing?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
That's the first thing they cover in the Bogdanovitch thing.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Yeah.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
It's a sign bar item on Wikipedia for all musicians.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Right.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
If you Wikipedia Prince, it says what his influences are.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
What are Prince's influences?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Billy Bob.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Billy Bob, what are they?

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
Billy Bob, what are Prince's influences?

14:55.000 --> 15:03.000
Oh, Prince's influences are.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Oh God.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
I'm trying to hold it.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Captain EO.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
For sure.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
For sure.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
David Bowie.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
I feel that.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Feel it.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
You started with Captain EO and then went to David Bowie.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
In that order.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
In the order of most influential.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Captain EO.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Captain EO.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
David Bowie.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Yeah.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
David Bowie.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
Not a close second, but definitely a second.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
The Muppets.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
James Brown.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
All right.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
All right.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Twin stuff.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Sorry.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
We made you jump off the twins.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Oh, twin stuff.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
All right.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
All right.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
So what are you guys?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Do you have private time?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Do you go like at the end of the day?

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Like do you go?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Do you go home?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Do you live in the same house?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Yeah.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
Like if one of you stubs their toe, do you the other feel it?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
No, we.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Now come on.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Somebody stub this guy's toe.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Hang on a second.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
That is an extraordinarily fair question.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
That is a super valid question.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
I don't want to stomp on the validity of that question.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I don't want to stub my toe on the validity of that question.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
I don't stub my nose in the face of that question.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Good.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
No.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
No, although.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Quite simply.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
That is bullshit.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
It's such horseshit.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Although I will say this, I will say this.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
Recently we were, we were about to go do some shows on the road.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
And when we have a really early morning flight, we'll call each other in the car as we're

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
driving.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
We don't live in the same house.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Like we both, yeah, we, we both have two families.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
We live on the only caboots in LA.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Yeah.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
It's a communal living site.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
So we're driving.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
We always, I will call him always, or he'll call me just to make sure that the other one

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
woke up and is coming to the gig.

16:56.000 --> 17:03.000
And, and so he called me and I couldn't take the call because I had stopped because I had

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
to pee so badly, like uncharacteristically so badly.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I had already peed in the morning.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
I was, I'd stopped at a 7-Eleven, which someone told me dummy.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
They don't have bathrooms at 7-Eleven.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
I didn't know that.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
I went in and got into a fight while I had to pee with the guy.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I was like, you have to pee somewhere.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
Like I don't know why I got into it with him at that point.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Then I was like, fuck it.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I'm going to walk outside.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I went, it was on Olympic in La Cienega.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
I went around to somebody's house and on our apartment building and peed on the side of

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
an apartment building because I had no hope.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I had no chance.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
I ran back into my car.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
I called Randy back and I was like, I'm so sorry.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
I saw you were calling.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I didn't want you to freak out that I wasn't up for the thing.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
But I had to pee so badly that I just peed on the side of a building.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
And you said, I just peed on the side of a building.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Is that true?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
No, that is true.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
And that is so fucked up.

17:53.000 --> 17:59.000
That is the most twin thing that's ever happened is that we both drank too much coffee before

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
going to LAX.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
And that was creepy.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
That almost made us want to stop doing comedy.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
That moment right there.

18:08.000 --> 18:14.000
But if we looked at your text messages, are you guys just nonstop checking in with each

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
other?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
I just brought you out as the Scar brothers.

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
I didn't call you Randy in whatever the other one's name is.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
That's what I do.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Jesus, you've been hanging out with us.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
You've been called brothers.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
You've been booked as the brothers.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
You're Burger King commercials as the Scar brothers.

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
But obviously, there can't be any because you were born that way, literally.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
There is no buildup of resentment or craving for individuality, right?

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Unless we find out right now.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Jason is not a planet.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
Yeah, no.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
I've been demoted.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Apparently, I don't have a fucking name.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
Thank you, Billy Bob.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
No.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Well, we have separate families and separate lives.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
And so, you know, like, I think the fact that we, even up into that point, but the fact

19:04.000 --> 19:11.000
that we now have kids and wives and we have multiple wives, Bill Paxton, RIP.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
You guys, you guys each have one wife and then you have a third wife that you didn't

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
break or Kronenberg, like you swap off.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
The relief wife.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
We each have second families, but it's the same.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
And they don't know about it.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
So they think it's just the same person coming in.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
That's the third wife is she just lives in an apartment with what she thinks is a guy

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
named Elijah Sklar.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Right.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
He just comes in.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
A man who's not a twin.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Sometimes he has glasses.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Sometimes he doesn't.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
He's just super attentive.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
He's around a lot for her.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
But the catch is one of you falls in love with her.

19:47.000 --> 19:55.000
I was going to say Thursday is on CBS, but it's called Hidden Figure.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
All right.

20:00.000 --> 20:06.000
Well, yeah, so we do have our own lives and what's crazy is that since we've had our

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
own families and kids and stuff, the, the, the, when we get together and we hang out with

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
it, can I say this?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Is this all right?

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Sure.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Sure.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Thanks, Rob.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Thanks, Rob.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
When we hang out, thanks, Spencer.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
We hang out.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
It just, it's fun.

20:21.000 --> 20:27.000
We actually look forward to it because I feel like we enjoy it more now than ever before

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
because speak for yourself.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Oh, no.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Is there a tone you guys have?

20:31.000 --> 20:38.000
Like if you, if you're, if you're by yourselves, the two of you, and then everybody else is

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
gone, does it ever get dark?

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
Like, like you share with each other this kind of like, you're like, oh, that one, you

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
know, like, or something or like, like, you guys are only on each other's sides and there's

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
like, like some fucking like weird energy between you where you're like, yes.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I don't think it's a weird energy.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Oh, I was going to say yes.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Yeah.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
No, maybe we're misinterpreting the energy between us.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
I think it's very normal.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
You think it's weird?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Oh, that's strange.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Who the fuck are you?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
I don't know.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
This is Dan.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Fuck.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.840
Uh, no, I, I think it is, I can describe it like this.

21:11.840 --> 21:15.600
I do think it, it goes beyond the normal sibling relationship.

21:15.600 --> 21:20.400
It goes beyond the normal, uh, friend relationship.

21:20.400 --> 21:24.120
Like we're past the point where you share things with each other.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.840
This is going to sound so bizarre.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.320
We are past the point where you share things with each other.

21:28.320 --> 21:32.960
And I think because we're twins in some weird way, we're allowed, we allow ourselves to

21:32.960 --> 21:35.920
be as hard on the other person as you would be on yourself.

21:35.920 --> 21:40.240
So as negative as you would be about yourself, you, and that to me is an intimacy to like,

21:40.240 --> 21:46.960
rip on someone who isn't you, the way you would basically rip on yourself is so intimate.

21:46.960 --> 21:50.560
But also I would, it's what every marriage should be upside to that is that you can confide

21:50.560 --> 21:56.080
in them and you wouldn't like, if I had a twin brother and then I found out like, I

21:56.080 --> 21:58.960
was like, wait, oh, redhead cheerleaders.

21:58.960 --> 22:03.440
I'd like, I'd like call my brother and go, I think it's redhead cheerleaders.

22:03.440 --> 22:04.440
Right.

22:04.440 --> 22:08.040
The combination has something to do with athletic socks and he'd be like, wait, oh, yeah.

22:08.040 --> 22:12.200
I don't know anything like that where you'd be like, you'd call him up and go like, wait,

22:12.200 --> 22:15.400
do you, are you, do you hate beans?

22:15.400 --> 22:17.520
So that's, that's, that's our journey.

22:17.520 --> 22:21.960
I think what you're just describing right there is to get, to actually, we're so close

22:21.960 --> 22:22.960
to each other.

22:22.960 --> 22:26.800
We're actually stepped on the other side of each other facing away from each other.

22:26.800 --> 22:32.120
So the key is now over the course of our lives, yeah, to the beginning of a duel.

22:32.120 --> 22:37.400
It's literally like, not to get all Hamilton about it, but the second movie poster from

22:37.400 --> 22:38.400
your trilogy.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.400
That's right.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.400
It's just that.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.400
The third one is the turn.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.400
You're facing each other again.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.400
Yeah.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.400
Gunpoint.

22:44.400 --> 22:45.400
And in between us is a redheaded cheerleader.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.400
So.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.400
Sops up.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.400
Sops.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.400
It's Julianne Moore.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.400
Julianne Moore.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.400
Yeah.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.760
It's like, it's, it's, it's the, it's the dark version of fabulous Baker boys.

22:54.760 --> 22:55.760
Right.

22:55.760 --> 22:56.760
Yes.

22:56.760 --> 22:57.760
Yes.

22:57.760 --> 23:03.040
So now our thing in life is, I think to peel it back and actually have the type of relationship

23:03.040 --> 23:05.480
that a close siblings would have.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.480
That is our work that we have to do.

23:07.480 --> 23:11.000
In other words, kind of examining yourselves for your individuality a little bit.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Totally.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.640
Experimenting with like, kind of like, you know what, like, like actually withholding

23:15.640 --> 23:16.640
from each other.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.640
Totally.

23:17.640 --> 23:18.640
So that there is.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.640
Yes.

23:19.640 --> 23:20.640
And or taking time apart from each other.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.480
So when we're not working, we're not doing that stuff.

23:22.480 --> 23:26.440
We do spend time with our different friends and family, friends and whatnot.

23:26.440 --> 23:29.280
So then when we do come back together, we are actually happy.

23:29.280 --> 23:35.400
I have to wonder if this biologically, psychologically mirrors the stage in a normal individual's

23:35.400 --> 23:40.160
life when they would be going through some threshold, that that's something that I've

23:40.160 --> 23:42.480
never heard about in twin studies.

23:42.480 --> 23:45.320
We're always so obsessed with like, Oh, who, what's the difference between nature and nurture?

23:45.320 --> 23:46.320
Let's study these twins.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.320
Right.

23:47.320 --> 23:52.560
But like that idea that, that twins have that unfettered intimacy and that you guys are

23:52.560 --> 23:55.120
experiencing this, this weird crisscross right now.

23:55.120 --> 24:01.480
I wonder if that coincides with, with the age at which a person goes through a lot of

24:01.480 --> 24:02.480
crisis.

24:02.480 --> 24:03.480
Like, wait, who am I?

24:03.480 --> 24:04.480
Yeah.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.480
I think so for sure.

24:05.480 --> 24:11.000
But I think we're, we, we experienced that more because mid twin crisis, mid twin crisis.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.080
But I think it's also cause we're comedians or we are constantly examining our relationship

24:16.080 --> 24:19.640
and who we are and what we're about and what's wrong with us and all that stuff.

24:19.640 --> 24:24.560
So yeah, we, we only participated in one twin study ever at, we grew up in St. Louis, Washington

24:24.560 --> 24:30.400
University and I don't want to say we fuck this thing up, but like, I had to go into

24:30.400 --> 24:33.080
a room and this is no joke.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.640
This actually happened.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.640
People were stunning this.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.640
I had to stare.

24:36.640 --> 24:40.640
There was like, it was just a little machine that would just light up with a red light

24:40.640 --> 24:45.680
when in another room, Randy was looking at a picture and I'm just looking at the hall,

24:45.680 --> 24:51.800
looking at a picture and I, for no reason, Rob, just rubbed my temples as if to send

24:51.800 --> 24:52.800
it to me.

24:52.800 --> 24:56.560
If to fucking send it through the ether to him like, cause I was like, that's what you're

24:56.560 --> 24:57.560
supposed to do.

24:57.560 --> 25:02.560
And I just had to, when the light came on, draw what popped into my head to see if he

25:02.560 --> 25:09.360
could send it across a hallway at Wash U. And not only did I not draw even a remotely

25:09.360 --> 25:14.640
close shape to anything he was looking at, it was so bad, like we, they shut down the

25:14.640 --> 25:15.640
experiment.

25:15.640 --> 25:16.640
They lost funding.

25:16.640 --> 25:21.560
They lost their grant and their funding because of our results.

25:21.560 --> 25:22.560
What did you draw?

25:22.560 --> 25:23.560
What did you draw?

25:23.560 --> 25:29.600
I drew, I remember he was looking at a tree, like a very tall tree and I drew a star, nothing

25:29.600 --> 25:32.160
like a tree, rounded edges and all that stuff.

25:32.160 --> 25:36.480
You were looking at a cow and I drew, I drew a car.

25:36.480 --> 25:39.560
You were looking at what, can you remember any of what the other ones were?

25:39.560 --> 25:40.560
I can't.

25:40.560 --> 25:42.760
You were looking, why don't you get in my head and find out.

25:42.760 --> 25:43.760
Okay.

25:43.760 --> 25:44.760
Let me rub them.

25:44.760 --> 25:45.760
But I can't remember.

25:45.760 --> 25:46.760
We were so off.

25:46.760 --> 25:49.680
It was so off that they couldn't even, it proved to us that we're like that, I don't

25:49.680 --> 25:50.680
believe in that shit.

25:50.680 --> 25:51.680
I really don't.

25:51.680 --> 25:58.440
I really, but being a comedian, weren't you tempted to just keep drawing dicks?

25:58.440 --> 25:59.440
Every car.

25:59.440 --> 26:00.440
He keeps thinking about that.

26:00.440 --> 26:01.440
I don't know.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.440
He's only 13.

26:02.440 --> 26:03.440
My brother.

26:03.440 --> 26:07.440
The car had a dick coming out of its mouth.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.440
It's just, I'm sorry, everything.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.440
Brother, keep thinking about dick.

26:10.440 --> 26:12.440
I don't know if you're looking at a cow, but he's thinking about dick.

26:12.440 --> 26:16.440
Cow had two dicks just so I can do on it.

26:16.440 --> 26:25.440
Well, let's bring up Brandon Johnson because he's back there, like pushing.

26:25.440 --> 26:38.440
Hi, Brandon, what is this shit about Pluto, man?

26:38.440 --> 26:39.440
Yeah, right?

26:39.440 --> 26:47.080
I just heard back there, all that talk about, I don't know what's going on.

26:47.080 --> 26:48.080
Is it a planet?

26:48.080 --> 26:49.080
Is it not a planet?

26:49.080 --> 26:50.080
Riveting.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.080
Riveting.

26:51.080 --> 26:52.080
Riveting.

26:52.080 --> 27:02.920
I can see Steve Harvey starting like a stand-up act, just like, what is this shit about Pluto?

27:02.920 --> 27:05.320
Now, you're a woman, right?

27:05.320 --> 27:06.320
Pluto.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.320
You're a planet.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.520
You're a planet.

27:09.520 --> 27:18.240
Speaking of comedy and comedians, I just drew a dick in my mind, Rob.

27:18.240 --> 27:26.960
I was at this function and Martin Short was being given an award and he just fucking murdered.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.480
Were you guys Martin Short fans?

27:28.480 --> 27:29.480
Huge.

27:29.480 --> 27:35.320
And then when he did Jiminy Glick, I was like, that is the most electric character.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.200
Martin Short was my guy.

27:37.200 --> 27:43.600
When I was in sixth grade, I think a lot of us, we start just by imitating people.

27:43.600 --> 27:54.640
I would just do Ed Grimly and Jack, let's see that, I'm mental, I must say, why is Billy

27:54.640 --> 27:56.760
Bob Thornton doing Ed Grimly?

27:56.760 --> 27:59.760
Billy Bob Thornton, why are you so mental Billy Bob?

27:59.760 --> 28:00.760
It's amazing.

28:00.760 --> 28:08.040
I want mashed potatoes, I must say, I must say, I'm completely mental, oh my God, oh

28:08.040 --> 28:09.640
my God, it's fucking beautiful.

28:09.640 --> 28:11.560
Why are you holding a triangle suddenly?

28:11.560 --> 28:17.000
If you do this mouth, you could do John Lithgow, oh my God.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.480
Brandon, who are your childhood comedy people?

28:22.480 --> 28:27.280
I love the Broadway whoopee was one of the first things I ever saw.

28:27.280 --> 28:32.000
The young comedian special Robin Williams was one of the first things I ever saw.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.440
I had to like, we had an old ass TV and we got HBO and we had dials on the shit, so

28:36.440 --> 28:40.960
I had to like, back in the day if you got cable, you had to hook it up and you'd have

28:40.960 --> 28:45.400
to dial for like, maybe a half an hour, just turn a dial, until the cable hooked up with

28:45.400 --> 28:50.560
like a raw signal, and fucking remember it, three o'clock in the morning, dial, dial, dial,

28:50.560 --> 28:56.480
and then whoopee girl Berg around the world in 88 days, and I was like, what the fuck.

28:56.480 --> 29:01.840
So you like the character pieces, like the one woman show, kind of like, I'm going to

29:01.840 --> 29:07.280
do 20 minutes as this person, and I mean that's what you were like.

29:07.280 --> 29:12.880
I mean, it's just my earliest memory of somebody who inspired me, but I didn't think like,

29:12.880 --> 29:16.760
I wasn't like, one woman show type, that's why I was in shock, I was like, this is one

29:16.760 --> 29:23.240
woman show, but it's funny, like, wasn't you molested when you were a kid or something?

29:23.240 --> 29:26.840
That's always how you can tell if someone's giving you a compliment or they hate something,

29:26.840 --> 29:28.120
like, how high their voice is.

29:28.120 --> 29:30.320
Ask me how her one woman show was.

29:30.320 --> 29:32.400
How was her one woman show?

29:32.400 --> 29:33.400
Scoot!

29:33.400 --> 29:34.960
Hated it, hated it.

29:34.960 --> 29:38.640
Okay, now ask me how her one woman show was.

29:38.640 --> 29:39.840
How was her one woman show?

29:39.840 --> 29:40.840
It was good.

29:40.840 --> 29:41.840
Oh, love it.

29:41.840 --> 29:42.840
That means it was really good.

29:42.840 --> 29:43.840
Holy shit.

29:43.840 --> 29:44.840
Wow.

29:44.840 --> 29:45.840
A lot of characters.

29:45.840 --> 29:46.840
You loved it.

29:46.840 --> 29:47.840
A lot of characters, man.

29:47.840 --> 29:48.840
Wait a minute.

29:48.840 --> 29:49.840
Wait a minute.

29:49.840 --> 29:52.840
All of my one woman shows have been terrible.

29:52.840 --> 29:54.840
No, they were good!

29:54.840 --> 29:55.840
They were great!

29:55.840 --> 29:56.840
They were great!

29:56.840 --> 29:57.840
They were great!

29:57.840 --> 29:58.840
They were great!

29:58.840 --> 29:59.840
They were great!

29:59.840 --> 30:00.840
They were great!

30:00.840 --> 30:01.840
Wait a minute.

30:01.840 --> 30:08.080
This is a little unrelated, but Schrab revealed to me at dinner tonight that he's going to

30:08.080 --> 30:09.080
choose...

30:09.080 --> 30:10.080
To us.

30:10.080 --> 30:11.080
To us.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.080
I was there.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.080
Thanks, Spence.

30:14.080 --> 30:18.840
You were sitting at the next table, though, facing the wall.

30:18.840 --> 30:19.840
Why did they make you do that?

30:19.840 --> 30:21.840
It's because you didn't order anything.

30:21.840 --> 30:22.840
Right, yeah.

30:22.840 --> 30:23.840
I forgot.

30:23.840 --> 30:30.760
You gotta eat a chimichanga you want a presence at my table.

30:30.760 --> 30:36.960
Schrab revealed to us that he is going to a vocal coach.

30:36.960 --> 30:37.960
Yes.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.760
Because he wants his voice lower.

30:39.760 --> 30:40.760
Wow.

30:40.760 --> 30:41.760
That's not completely it.

30:41.760 --> 30:42.760
Let me ask you.

30:42.760 --> 30:43.760
No, okay.

30:43.760 --> 30:44.760
All right, all right, okay.

30:44.760 --> 30:45.760
How is that working out for you?

30:45.760 --> 30:46.760
It's good.

30:46.760 --> 30:47.760
It's good.

30:47.760 --> 30:48.760
It's good.

30:48.760 --> 30:49.760
It's going pretty well, right?

30:49.760 --> 30:50.760
Yeah.

30:50.760 --> 30:51.760
How is your vocal coach?

30:51.760 --> 30:52.760
It's good.

30:52.760 --> 30:53.760
It's good.

30:53.760 --> 30:54.760
It's good.

30:54.760 --> 30:55.760
It's good.

30:55.760 --> 30:56.760
It's good.

30:56.760 --> 30:57.760
It's good.

30:57.760 --> 30:58.760
It's good.

30:58.760 --> 30:59.760
It's good.

30:59.760 --> 31:00.760
It's good.

31:00.760 --> 31:01.760
I hope it's going better.

31:01.760 --> 31:05.760
It just started, so you're not going to hear anything.

31:05.760 --> 31:09.760
Obviously, my knee jerk reflex was, you know, maybe this is a little disrespectful to Schrab,

31:09.760 --> 31:14.760
like, because people, we have a tendency to, if somebody were to say to us, like, oh,

31:14.760 --> 31:17.760
I'm going to do this, you know, if somebody you respect and you like, like, we have a knee

31:17.760 --> 31:21.760
jerk reaction that comes from the best of intentions, which is we kind of like, we want to argue

31:21.760 --> 31:22.760
with them.

31:22.760 --> 31:23.760
Like, no, you shouldn't do that.

31:23.760 --> 31:24.760
You shouldn't change.

31:24.760 --> 31:25.760
You're finding a way you are.

31:25.760 --> 31:26.760
Right.

31:26.760 --> 31:30.760
I do, but I've inspected it from that angle, and I'm still like, what the fuck is he talking

31:30.760 --> 31:31.760
about?

31:31.760 --> 31:32.760
Why?

31:32.760 --> 31:35.480
I just wanted to bring it up, because I just like, I don't, you were saying, Rob, that

31:35.480 --> 31:39.960
the guy was saying, when you went in for your consultation, that he said, you're holding

31:39.960 --> 31:41.760
your breath more than you should, or something like that.

31:41.760 --> 31:46.760
Well, I mean, right now I'm comfortable in everything, but when I'm, you know, on set,

31:46.760 --> 31:52.880
or I'm, you know, in a pitch meeting, if, you know, when I'm having a bad time, I tend

31:52.880 --> 31:59.600
to talk fast and not breathe, and I, my register goes up and it, and it's just learning how

31:59.600 --> 32:03.720
to breathe and talk and think and just organize your thoughts and stuff.

32:03.720 --> 32:06.200
It's just something that I'm doing to, to improve myself.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.680
I'm so sorry we made fun of it.

32:08.680 --> 32:12.760
So how low, how low do you want to talk?

32:12.760 --> 32:13.760
Lou Rawls.

32:13.760 --> 32:14.760
Really low.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.760
I mean, lower than this.

32:16.760 --> 32:20.120
Like hip, like, I mean, like, hip, what?

32:20.120 --> 32:21.120
Like hibbert.

32:21.120 --> 32:22.960
Hib, hip, per.

32:22.960 --> 32:23.960
Hibbert.

32:23.960 --> 32:24.960
Hibbert?

32:24.960 --> 32:25.960
Yeah.

32:25.960 --> 32:26.960
The doctor on the Simpsons.

32:26.960 --> 32:29.960
Oh, sure.

32:29.960 --> 32:30.960
People like it.

32:30.960 --> 32:33.400
People are room full of these people would know that shit.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.400
Y'all about to lose y'all Simpsons cars.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.860
Would you want to talk this low.

32:37.860 --> 32:40.620
I don't know.

32:40.620 --> 32:42.840
I like at 2.09, registered, I think.

32:42.840 --> 32:45.320
Hey, hey, how was her one woman show?

32:45.320 --> 32:47.540
It was alright.

32:47.540 --> 33:00.540
You didn't really find anything you liked in it.

33:00.540 --> 33:02.740
Well there was this one part.

33:02.740 --> 33:03.740
He must have loved that part.

33:03.740 --> 33:04.740
That's actually incredible.

33:04.740 --> 33:05.740
Mark Short came out.

33:05.740 --> 33:06.740
Mark Short came out.

33:06.740 --> 33:07.740
Mark Short came out.

33:07.740 --> 33:08.740
Mark Short was good.

33:08.740 --> 33:09.740
He was good.

33:09.740 --> 33:10.740
He was good.

33:10.740 --> 33:11.740
Yeah.

33:11.740 --> 33:14.740
And then, you know, he introduced Chevy Chase.

33:14.740 --> 33:15.740
Chevy Chase.

33:15.740 --> 33:16.740
That's good.

33:16.740 --> 33:17.740
That's good.

33:17.740 --> 33:28.940
But this is what I'm talking about, you know, when you're talking like this, which is my

33:28.940 --> 33:36.540
comfortable register, you know, which to some people is grading, you know, I just like,

33:36.540 --> 33:42.420
you know, I'm trying to, I'm just trying to, trying to fix this fucking problem, which

33:42.420 --> 33:43.420
is my life.

33:43.420 --> 33:44.940
I think a lot of people like your voices.

33:44.940 --> 33:45.940
I think I like it.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.940
A lot of people don't.

33:47.940 --> 33:53.260
Well, Rob, but when I first met you, like Rob, I mean, when your origin story is your

33:53.260 --> 33:59.940
hairpiece story, like Rob lost his hair at a very young age and at a time before Pulp

33:59.940 --> 34:04.180
Fiction, before it was even possible to be masculine and bald, like in cinema, before

34:04.180 --> 34:05.180
Bruce Willis.

34:05.180 --> 34:06.180
Impossible.

34:06.180 --> 34:09.020
Before it was a big rave from that movie, Jesus.

34:09.020 --> 34:17.420
Well, before, and before Jean, the new captain goddamn Picard, like, like there was no, there

34:17.420 --> 34:22.380
weren't bald, bald men were, you know, whatever, the, the, the hair loss was different as you

34:22.380 --> 34:23.380
go up through the ages.

34:23.380 --> 34:28.540
I'm not saying it's equivalent to anything else that's a struggle, but, but, but you

34:28.540 --> 34:34.340
told the story of like, you had a girlfriend that was like, you know, she made it obvious

34:34.340 --> 34:38.420
that she said if you had hair, you know, maybe you do need a hairpiece.

34:38.420 --> 34:41.860
And then you went to the, you went to the hair, had Lions Club.

34:41.860 --> 34:42.860
Lions Club, yes.

34:42.860 --> 34:47.020
And you went and you, you, you had them outfit you with a fucking head of hair.

34:47.020 --> 34:54.900
So real hair, somebody's hair was woven into a wig and, and, and I was like, oh man, this

34:54.900 --> 34:55.900
is it.

34:55.900 --> 34:58.900
I'm going to be fucking sexy again.

34:58.900 --> 34:59.900
Anyway.

34:59.900 --> 35:05.300
And it looks, looked like exactly how you're picturing it.

35:05.300 --> 35:07.780
I'm just like.

35:07.780 --> 35:15.420
Like a hair hat, like a bull cut round hair, like, and, and, and I walked home wearing

35:15.420 --> 35:25.940
it just like walking down the street, crossing the street and wearing it and then looked

35:25.940 --> 35:32.100
myself in the mirror and I said, oh shit, I can't, I can't do this.

35:32.100 --> 35:37.740
And I put it in a shoe box and then I, I walked back to the Lions Club and I said, I can't

35:37.740 --> 35:38.740
do this.

35:38.740 --> 35:39.740
I'm sorry.

35:39.740 --> 35:44.180
And I gave it back to them and I left and then I shaved my head and then I never had

35:44.180 --> 35:45.380
a problem with it ever again.

35:45.380 --> 35:46.380
Yeah.

35:46.380 --> 35:48.540
So, you know, that was 19 everybody.

35:48.540 --> 35:50.580
And that woman is now your vocal coach.

35:50.580 --> 35:51.580
Yeah.

35:51.580 --> 35:52.580
Full circle guys.

35:52.580 --> 35:55.580
Don't you make the equation there with your voice?

35:55.580 --> 36:00.140
I mean, who cares what your voice, I mean, like, like, you know, I'm, I like me.

36:00.140 --> 36:01.380
I like my voice.

36:01.380 --> 36:07.180
I just, I'm, I'm, it's all about like when I don't like me and when I don't like my

36:07.180 --> 36:12.460
voice, it's, it's, I'm trying to get over that, you know, part.

36:12.460 --> 36:13.460
It's not right now.

36:13.460 --> 36:14.460
All right.

36:14.460 --> 36:17.740
I mean, I'm not trying to high road you, but isn't it easier to just, to, to change

36:17.740 --> 36:21.300
the way that you feel about yourself than change your voice?

36:21.300 --> 36:22.300
Yes, exactly.

36:22.300 --> 36:23.300
Exactly.

36:23.300 --> 36:24.300
And I think this is a part of it.

36:24.300 --> 36:25.700
Well, when you, oh, this show, this show right here.

36:25.700 --> 36:26.700
No, no, no, no.

36:26.700 --> 36:30.980
Well, the training is like, like I said to you when I explained while I was doing this.

36:30.980 --> 36:31.980
In confidence.

36:31.980 --> 36:32.980
Yes.

36:32.980 --> 36:39.860
When I said, I said, like, look, you know, if it's, even if it's a placebo, if I, in

36:39.860 --> 36:44.420
the past, when I've done the homework and then I've gone into like a meeting where I

36:44.420 --> 36:51.660
need to be everything I need to be and everything I know that I need to do and can do, I can

36:51.660 --> 36:52.660
do it.

36:52.660 --> 36:55.780
But, you know, when, you know, that's what it's all about.

36:55.780 --> 36:56.780
Well, I found.

36:56.780 --> 36:57.780
Some things I don't like about myself.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.300
Uh, what do you, what do you do?

36:59.300 --> 37:00.300
Like what?

37:00.300 --> 37:01.300
Get into it.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.300
Top five.

37:03.300 --> 37:05.300
Teen.

37:05.300 --> 37:07.020
15.

37:07.020 --> 37:08.020
Top five.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.020
Teen.

37:09.020 --> 37:10.020
Things you don't like about yourself.

37:10.020 --> 37:11.020
Let me start.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.020
Attitude.

37:12.020 --> 37:13.020
Wait a minute.

37:13.020 --> 37:14.020
Wait a minute.

37:14.020 --> 37:15.020
Wait.

37:15.020 --> 37:16.020
No, this is for him to answer.

37:16.020 --> 37:17.020
Eye contact.

37:17.020 --> 37:18.020
No, it's for him.

37:18.020 --> 37:19.020
Returning text.

37:19.020 --> 37:20.020
Wow.

37:20.020 --> 37:22.820
Your Billy Bob Thornton impression.

37:22.820 --> 37:23.820
Yes.

37:23.820 --> 37:24.820
Dinner secrets.

37:24.820 --> 37:25.820
Time management.

37:25.820 --> 37:31.820
What do we just get?

37:31.820 --> 37:32.820
Seven?

37:32.820 --> 37:33.820
All of those things.

37:33.820 --> 37:36.820
I, I'd like a little less hair on my shoulders.

37:36.820 --> 37:37.820
Yeah.

37:37.820 --> 37:44.540
And I wish, I wish that my toe and fingernails didn't grow, but I guess that's a universal

37:44.540 --> 37:45.540
human thing.

37:45.540 --> 37:46.540
Yeah.

37:46.540 --> 37:47.540
This is going to happen.

37:47.540 --> 37:48.540
Uh, I feel like we should have invented that.

37:48.540 --> 37:50.300
That'll happen after you're dead.

37:50.300 --> 37:56.580
I wish that the hair on my legs didn't stop, um, just short of my ankles.

37:56.580 --> 37:58.740
That was because you were abducted by aliens.

37:58.740 --> 38:02.260
That's what you told me, like in 1997.

38:02.260 --> 38:03.260
Were you?

38:03.260 --> 38:05.460
I think it's because I wore my socks too much when I was a kid.

38:05.460 --> 38:06.460
I don't know.

38:06.460 --> 38:10.500
No, no, you said I was abducted by aliens, and that's why the hair on your legs doesn't

38:10.500 --> 38:12.660
go all the way up to your kneecaps.

38:12.660 --> 38:14.580
Well, which one is it?

38:14.580 --> 38:16.300
Harmless socks or aliens?

38:16.300 --> 38:17.300
Which one?

38:17.300 --> 38:18.900
I don't remember that conversation.

38:18.900 --> 38:23.340
Maybe I was, maybe I was defending myself against a new adult friend who was inquiring

38:23.340 --> 38:24.340
about my body hair.

38:24.340 --> 38:25.340
I don't know.

38:25.340 --> 38:26.340
I don't remember.

38:26.340 --> 38:27.340
It was 1997.

38:27.340 --> 38:30.340
We've known each other since 91.

38:30.340 --> 38:33.940
I thought this was from dinner the other night, you know, the last night.

38:33.940 --> 38:37.740
Well, back then in the late nineties, we were getting into alien abduction mythology because

38:37.740 --> 38:41.300
we were trying to write a screenplay about alien abductions and things, like, like, and

38:41.300 --> 38:42.500
I was researching a lot of it.

38:42.500 --> 38:47.580
So I was starting to think about my frequent nosebleeds and maybe body hair patterns because

38:47.580 --> 38:50.100
they were being mirrored in the testimonials in the book.

38:50.100 --> 38:52.540
I no longer believe that.

38:52.540 --> 38:56.260
I think it's probably, how's your guys' body hair?

38:56.260 --> 39:00.460
Oh, I think I have more body hair than you do.

39:00.460 --> 39:01.460
Yeah.

39:01.460 --> 39:02.460
How is that possible?

39:02.460 --> 39:03.460
I don't know.

39:03.460 --> 39:06.780
But you guys must, like, text each other, like, you must have been to it and go, like,

39:06.780 --> 39:08.580
do you have that thing with your nipple?

39:08.580 --> 39:09.580
Yeah.

39:09.580 --> 39:10.580
Do you?

39:10.580 --> 39:11.580
I don't want to hear.

39:11.580 --> 39:12.580
We don't text each other.

39:12.580 --> 39:14.260
I can grow a beard, like, in 20 minutes.

39:14.260 --> 39:15.260
Yeah.

39:15.260 --> 39:21.060
I really want to know, do you guys, like, actually, like, like, sexually, do you exchange

39:21.060 --> 39:23.980
not so hot twins?

39:23.980 --> 39:24.980
Do you?

39:24.980 --> 39:25.980
So fucking hot.

39:25.980 --> 39:26.980
No, that's...

39:26.980 --> 39:28.980
Do you get that a lot?

39:28.980 --> 39:29.980
Oh, man.

39:29.980 --> 39:30.980
Twins.

39:30.980 --> 39:31.980
And twins.

39:31.980 --> 39:32.980
And twins.

39:32.980 --> 39:33.980
So hot.

39:33.980 --> 39:39.980
If one of you experiences something, if one of you, like, try a cock ring or an accidently,

39:39.980 --> 39:45.140
like, twist both your nipples while you were orgasming or you put on a pantyhose over your

39:45.140 --> 39:50.220
face and swung from a ceiling fan, and then you, like, come your brains out, do you text

39:50.220 --> 39:52.420
the other one and go, like, have you tried this?

39:52.420 --> 39:53.420
Yeah.

39:53.420 --> 39:54.420
Because you might be into it.

39:54.420 --> 39:55.420
You might love it.

39:55.420 --> 39:56.420
Because you're genetically identical.

39:56.420 --> 39:58.620
I've cracked the code.

39:58.620 --> 39:59.620
We haven't yet.

39:59.620 --> 40:00.620
No, we haven't.

40:00.620 --> 40:01.620
Maybe we should start.

40:01.620 --> 40:03.220
All those things you suggested, I just made a mental note.

40:03.220 --> 40:04.220
I was like, maybe.

40:04.220 --> 40:05.220
Yeah.

40:05.220 --> 40:06.220
It's possible.

40:06.220 --> 40:08.140
All those things people do because they don't have twin brothers.

40:08.140 --> 40:09.140
So you guys have a...

40:09.140 --> 40:13.140
Like, maybe we're all more darker and private and we're a little... we're suffocated in our

40:13.140 --> 40:14.140
cocoons.

40:14.140 --> 40:15.140
Right.

40:15.140 --> 40:19.940
And you guys are just... get to be more mainstream, like, you just lay the pipe, missionary style

40:19.940 --> 40:20.940
and...

40:20.940 --> 40:21.940
Yeah.

40:21.940 --> 40:22.940
...roll over and smoke a cigarette.

40:22.940 --> 40:23.940
That's right.

40:23.940 --> 40:25.740
No, no conversation needed.

40:25.740 --> 40:26.740
Right.

40:26.740 --> 40:27.740
Tell us about your podcast.

40:27.740 --> 40:28.740
Oh, snap.

40:28.740 --> 40:29.740
Oh, shit.

40:29.740 --> 40:30.740
What?

40:30.740 --> 40:31.740
Oh.

40:31.740 --> 40:32.740
Oh, Jesus.

40:32.740 --> 40:33.740
Oh, shit.

40:33.740 --> 40:34.740
Oh, shit.

40:34.740 --> 40:35.740
Oh, shit.

40:35.740 --> 40:36.740
Oh, shit.

40:36.740 --> 40:37.740
Oh, shit.

40:37.740 --> 40:38.740
Oh, shit.

40:38.740 --> 40:39.740
Oh, shit.

40:39.740 --> 40:40.740
Oh, shit.

40:40.740 --> 40:41.740
Oh, shit.

40:41.740 --> 40:42.740
Oh, shit.

40:42.740 --> 40:45.740
Yeah, I'm being sponsored by Fernette Branca.

40:45.740 --> 40:47.740
Our podcast is...

40:47.740 --> 40:50.740
Our podcast is all about us sharing sexual proclivities.

40:50.740 --> 40:51.740
Yes.

40:51.740 --> 40:52.740
Yes.

40:52.740 --> 40:53.740
With each other.

40:53.740 --> 40:55.940
It's a warm people town, it's like... it's all those... it's the most...

40:55.940 --> 40:58.100
I wasn't asking you, Dan.

40:58.100 --> 41:04.100
But I like to hear him talking about... no, it's just us breaking down three insane stories

41:04.100 --> 41:05.620
and going super deep.

41:05.620 --> 41:06.620
And the stories...

41:06.620 --> 41:07.620
Story number one.

41:07.620 --> 41:08.620
Story number one.

41:08.620 --> 41:09.620
High voices.

41:09.620 --> 41:10.620
No.

41:10.620 --> 41:11.620
No, no.

41:11.620 --> 41:14.580
No, it's three crazy stories from the news

41:14.580 --> 41:16.460
that we get from our listeners, actually.

41:16.460 --> 41:18.700
And then us and Dan Van Kirk, our co-host,

41:18.700 --> 41:21.860
along with the guest, we just start riffing.

41:21.860 --> 41:24.980
And the stories are just comedy launching pads,

41:24.980 --> 41:25.820
and we just go.

41:25.820 --> 41:26.700
It's kind of like a writer's room

41:26.700 --> 41:28.500
before you get down to the actual writing.

41:28.500 --> 41:30.820
How much Florida is in there?

41:30.820 --> 41:31.940
It's a lot of Florida.

41:31.940 --> 41:35.300
I mean, we know so much about it from the first line

41:35.300 --> 41:37.820
of like this person, like everyone,

41:37.820 --> 41:40.580
like we can guess the age of people by their behavior now

41:40.580 --> 41:41.900
because we've done a bunch of them.

41:41.900 --> 41:44.940
Like, usually, I know when someone looks like they're 50,

41:44.940 --> 41:46.220
but they're 33.

41:46.220 --> 41:47.860
Like, I can tell that from the whole story.

41:47.860 --> 41:48.940
How old is Dan?

41:51.180 --> 41:51.900
33.

41:51.900 --> 41:52.940
33 years old?

41:54.980 --> 41:55.820
Daniel probably just...

41:55.820 --> 41:56.820
Oh, that's about right.

41:58.820 --> 41:59.780
I think you're around our age,

41:59.780 --> 42:01.220
slightly older than us, but.

42:02.220 --> 42:03.060
What was that?

42:03.060 --> 42:04.540
What was that drug in Florida?

42:04.540 --> 42:05.380
What was it?

42:05.380 --> 42:06.820
Yucca, flucca, fucca?

42:06.820 --> 42:09.740
Wacca, flucca, flucca, flucca, flucca.

42:09.740 --> 42:11.380
I think that's a rapper.

42:11.380 --> 42:14.940
But, yeah, no, there's always like,

42:14.940 --> 42:17.100
scissor and like these to every.

42:17.100 --> 42:17.940
Scissor.

42:18.940 --> 42:20.980
It's like the drugs are like going through

42:20.980 --> 42:22.180
what Silicon Valley is going through.

42:22.180 --> 42:23.820
Like, we have to come up with a word

42:23.820 --> 42:26.060
that no one's squatted on the domain for.

42:27.220 --> 42:29.260
So, someone's looking for a drug.

42:29.260 --> 42:31.260
We don't want them to go to fucking.

42:31.260 --> 42:32.420
Beagle tots.

42:33.540 --> 42:34.380
No, yeah.

42:34.380 --> 42:35.220
It's insane.

42:35.220 --> 42:36.940
Has that been taken?

42:36.940 --> 42:39.180
No, we had a story about a guy on a date

42:39.180 --> 42:40.980
who I think this was in Florida

42:40.980 --> 42:42.700
where he was trying to impress his date

42:42.700 --> 42:46.220
and jump over like from one building to the next

42:46.220 --> 42:49.500
and he didn't make it and slid all the way down

42:49.500 --> 42:50.980
between the two buildings.

42:50.980 --> 42:53.100
They got closer as it got there.

42:53.100 --> 42:54.940
Cause they weren't built properly.

42:54.940 --> 42:56.980
And he got stuck and the fire department

42:56.980 --> 42:58.940
had to come in and bust the wall down

42:58.940 --> 43:00.580
of a Chipotle to get him out.

43:00.580 --> 43:02.020
Why did the buildings get close?

43:02.020 --> 43:03.780
Is it Tim Burton's?

43:03.780 --> 43:08.780
I tried to jump the leading tower.

43:09.580 --> 43:10.780
Are you ready for the distance

43:10.780 --> 43:12.220
between the two buildings?

43:12.220 --> 43:13.220
A foot and a half.

43:14.620 --> 43:16.020
How long?

43:16.020 --> 43:17.420
Who misses that?

43:17.420 --> 43:18.540
It was like this.

43:18.540 --> 43:19.660
So he wasn't mad.

43:19.660 --> 43:23.460
Who goes, I'm going, hey, hey babe, check this out.

43:23.460 --> 43:25.460
I'm going to jump a foot and a half.

43:26.460 --> 43:27.780
I got this.

43:27.780 --> 43:32.220
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

43:32.220 --> 43:36.040
Call the fire department, call the fire department.

43:39.960 --> 43:42.220
Call the fire department.

43:43.780 --> 43:47.060
All the Chipotle are stuck.

43:47.060 --> 43:48.140
They punch through the wall.

43:48.140 --> 43:49.620
They get him out.

43:49.620 --> 43:52.040
And he probably just looked at him and was like,

43:52.040 --> 43:53.220
So can I call you again?

43:53.220 --> 43:54.140
He must've did not have any.

43:55.420 --> 43:57.340
I know you're going to punch through the wall

43:57.340 --> 44:00.780
but could I get like a number five?

44:00.780 --> 44:01.620
And some chips.

44:01.620 --> 44:06.660
they punched through the wall and it was the wall of the one of the two buildings was a bank and

44:06.660 --> 44:11.540
he bolted through and took all the money and ran away that would be the biggest like the greatest

44:11.540 --> 44:21.780
heist ever the Thomas crown affair the tinder heist of 2016 I mean I feel bad for that guy because

44:21.780 --> 44:25.860
number one he didn't he's not doing something stupid in the beginning he's it's a foot and a

44:25.860 --> 44:32.580
half so yeah so he's he's as dumb as any of us I got it he's just very lucky I just want the audio

44:32.580 --> 44:45.620
for it hey hey baby let me show you something just fingernails coming down how long how long

44:45.620 --> 44:57.380
of a fall was it like a couple it was a few stories I know it wasn't like it wasn't like it was just

44:57.380 --> 45:11.540
magic stories like that what is the appeal to us is that the same as like watching intervention

45:11.540 --> 45:16.180
or hoarders or something like that where we just we just want to we just want to look down and not

45:16.180 --> 45:24.660
see rock bottom we see another person I think you feel yes yes the top of one person at least

45:24.660 --> 45:30.020
before rock bottom yes I think you feel better about yourself but just to know and and sometimes

45:30.020 --> 45:35.540
we try and justify everything that someone does in this situation I mean always like the best move

45:35.540 --> 45:41.700
whenever which is a healthy exercise right totally like like trying to figure out is it the yeah I mean

45:42.340 --> 45:49.780
humanity of someone like someone who shits in a pool and then goes into the house and goes into

45:49.780 --> 45:55.700
the bed and sleeps with the six-year-old uh hey let's get into it let's try to figure out what

45:55.700 --> 46:02.500
positive thing first of all have you ever taken a shit that just makes you tired we've all been

46:02.500 --> 46:10.820
there you walk out of there like did I just do a like a like a 3k or something I have no electrolytes

46:10.820 --> 46:16.740
anymore after that shit I need to lay down would you say sleep with a six year old do you mean

46:16.740 --> 46:22.020
no no none of that's just actually literally just go to bed in your bed just took a nap yeah just took

46:22.020 --> 46:29.380
a nap lay down next to a different family's child and then the pair oh no and then the parents

46:29.380 --> 46:34.500
protected him from the cops the cops came as like it's someone in here they're like no no we're

46:34.500 --> 46:39.300
all right like they were some reason protecting this guy we care about this person more I remember

46:39.300 --> 46:46.100
we were at the cops come though because uh they reported a naked man with a machete oh then they

46:46.100 --> 46:51.460
figured it out was pooping in their pool yeah machete you left out the machete it is it is

46:51.460 --> 46:56.580
Florida it is Florida yeah it was Florida no but I just I remember back like just the parents

46:56.580 --> 47:01.060
not wanting to like involve this I don't know what they were trying to do they're like we can handle

47:01.060 --> 47:04.820
his son as well we don't trust the cops or whatever well you can't discount human empathy I mean

47:04.820 --> 47:09.220
they must they looked into his eyes when he woke up and we're just like he's a human being and then

47:09.220 --> 47:13.780
they looked into the cops eyes when the cops showed up and they're like this guy's dead yeah no human

47:13.780 --> 47:19.460
but but I like to shit in my pool if you shit in my pool no I like to think that it's like they

47:19.460 --> 47:24.100
didn't know about the turd yeah exactly when they were sticking up from the cops they're like

47:24.100 --> 47:28.100
they're like would you bring them mother fucker out here we're gonna take them away all right

47:28.100 --> 47:32.740
Billy Bob just take it easy for a second we're we're you know this country has has room for

47:32.740 --> 47:38.980
error honey there's a turd in our pool get him out he's right over there or the cops left and

47:38.980 --> 47:42.340
then they're like would you like some lemonade would you like some breakfast would you like to

47:42.340 --> 47:50.740
go for a swim no thank you wait what is that did you shit no I didn't so are you telling me on

47:50.740 --> 47:57.460
the same night we met you someone else took a shit in our pool we said the same night I would

47:57.460 --> 48:03.460
imagine a shit in the pool is probably a lot like a water berth you know what I mean like it's not

48:03.460 --> 48:08.580
we all picture the caddy shack bit with the flow yeah no but I mean for the person doing the

48:08.580 --> 48:14.100
shitting like you're never immersed fully in water you take a shit yeah like that was probably

48:14.100 --> 48:23.460
yourself oh yes just that just so he was in the pool then he was in the pool I think he was in

48:23.460 --> 48:29.540
the pool so he got into this bed where yeah well he probably dried off I mean he's not an animal

48:29.540 --> 48:36.260
yeah I mean this is he has common sense yeah he's thank you considerate person stupid question I'm

48:36.260 --> 48:43.300
sure all right well that's probably your favorite so far that is very run of the mill for the stories

48:43.300 --> 48:47.300
that we get and we get a chance talk about but it's a it's a good fun time and we love doing it

48:47.300 --> 48:52.820
where are you guys from from st. Louis all three of us all three of us yeah thank you

48:52.820 --> 48:56.580
Lewis for something that I thought you were from Chicago Brandon I don't know I guess I lived in

48:56.580 --> 49:02.580
Chicago for a little bit but st. Louis yeah st. Louis little town called University St. Lou

49:02.580 --> 49:10.180
good old st. Louis good old Louis yeah good old provincial old twin toopy we all three escaped

49:10.180 --> 49:15.940
yes gateway to the west yes they're like that's the courthouse the old courthouse and we're like

49:15.940 --> 49:20.740
why is that place famous the dread Scott case oh the case where you could go back up north and get

49:20.740 --> 49:26.660
your slaves and bring them back down south that's why it's famous congratulations that's great horrible

49:26.660 --> 49:31.860
horrifying really proud to be here yeah what was what was st who's st. Louis in the bible like

49:31.860 --> 49:41.860
like what what did what did Lewis do I think it was the patron saint of acid wash i rock

49:41.860 --> 49:47.700
it was the first dude to rock the st lb yeah he refused with st. Louis seminar I you know what

49:47.700 --> 49:51.700
dude I I love growing up in st. Louis I will say this I don't know how you feel about that but I

49:51.700 --> 49:56.260
just feel like it did connect us with like people that we probably would not have met had we grown

49:56.260 --> 50:03.460
up out here like we were just just just yeah no but it did connect the types of people yes that is

50:03.460 --> 50:08.180
also true the guy who but when we worked like we worked at a snack bar at a pool when we were 14

50:08.180 --> 50:15.220
years old the guy who brought us the ice was this tall thin guy that's that Keith Longinette

50:15.220 --> 50:20.340
fucking great I hope he fucking listens to this Keith Longinette he no he's dead he's probably

50:20.340 --> 50:26.660
dead right now he the Longinette family was brutally massed by a man with a machete you

50:26.660 --> 50:34.180
shit in their pool yeah Keith Longinette claimed to us that and there is no proof of this no

50:34.180 --> 50:41.300
but we had to just agree with him that he kicked the longest field goal in Missouri state class

50:41.300 --> 50:47.860
5a high school football history and just told us every time he saw that's what he did that to me

50:47.860 --> 50:53.940
is like that I don't think people hold on to shit out here like that that is just an unbelievable

50:53.940 --> 50:58.260
credit and an unbelievable thing there's an amazing book by Jonathan Franzen that he wrote

50:58.260 --> 51:03.220
before the corrections called the 27th city I don't know if you read that it's about St. Louis

51:03.220 --> 51:11.940
it's amazing amazing amazing are you just saying that yes okay it's it's an incredible book it pretty

51:11.940 --> 51:17.620
much nails the city in every way shape form but I do I actually say I do love that did you like

51:17.620 --> 51:21.620
growing up there you probably did I like growing up in you city I didn't like St. Louis right you

51:21.620 --> 51:27.220
city was like racist yeah it's pretty racist but you said he was like mostly Jewish a lot of black

51:27.220 --> 51:32.900
families a lot of multiracial families tons of culture it's the city that they recently vandalized

51:32.900 --> 51:39.540
when you see in the national news that that cemetery our family our family is buried in that

51:39.540 --> 51:44.580
cemetery um so that part was dope because it was great to grow up with like another culture

51:44.580 --> 51:48.740
but the rest of St. Louis what are you saying the part that our family was in the cemetery that

51:48.740 --> 51:54.100
was vandalized was dope because you guys don't really make the news right I was like how dope is

51:54.100 --> 51:59.540
that shit right right there had been a black cemetery but they used it they you know they put

51:59.540 --> 52:04.980
an airport over it yeah it did not make the news like this shit but but still it was dope that

52:04.980 --> 52:13.300
your people thank you I can't over yeah get on the mouth thanks man very twisted relationship

52:13.300 --> 52:17.860
that this country has with I'm not going to blow your mind with this with Judaism with

52:18.580 --> 52:24.500
I'd say like like conservatives love the fuck out of Israel it's unreal get enough Israel because

52:24.500 --> 52:28.740
they think of it as like a football team like like like we love Israel we love Israel's like

52:28.740 --> 52:33.380
this great like amazing like like the Alabama Crimson time yeah like don't fuck with Israel

52:33.380 --> 52:38.500
and they're and anyone that's like chest puffed up and patriotic is kind of right to think that

52:38.500 --> 52:43.060
way I guess because they have great recruiting they're I mean they're they're a they're a fucking like

52:43.060 --> 52:48.100
the colors are great but but blue and the white the lighters are kind of those people reconcile

52:48.100 --> 52:53.380
they're fucking blatant anti-semitism I mean they they they really go ahead Jay you can talk deeply

52:53.380 --> 52:58.980
about this wow how I don't know you just know people close yeah I there are people in my family

52:58.980 --> 53:04.500
I'm not going to call them out but uh that my family not Randy's family that are that are

53:04.500 --> 53:12.100
are conservative and because of Israel and I just want to be like it's not like if anyone

53:12.100 --> 53:16.020
else is there they're not going to shit on Israel they might call Israel on some stuff

53:16.020 --> 53:21.060
but they're not going to shit on Israel Israel's like a good restaurant in like a weird rough

53:21.060 --> 53:25.540
neighborhood all right they're not the city's not going to suddenly come in and be like close this

53:25.540 --> 53:31.620
shit down we need it it's good it's like there there's a lot of good that comes out of it so

53:31.620 --> 53:37.940
it's a very odd it's a very odd relationship because that happens I think the I think there's no way

53:37.940 --> 53:42.500
desecration of of a Jewish cemetery has not happened in even in the Bush administration

53:42.500 --> 53:47.060
I think it's completely because sorry I didn't mean to make take the derail this yeah by the way

53:47.060 --> 53:52.100
no this is the part of the show where but no but I do I do think it's because Trump is like

53:52.100 --> 53:57.860
oh Steve Bannon come on in and so now anyone who has like aligned feelings like that they don't

53:57.860 --> 54:00.900
feel like there's going to be any consequences for what they're doing so now like more and more

54:00.900 --> 54:05.460
Jewish community centers are being threatened more and more you know the cemetery dude I Steve Bannon

54:05.460 --> 54:10.020
scares the fuck out of me I'll be like about to pick my daughter up from ballet and I'm standing

54:10.020 --> 54:13.460
outside the Jewish community center in Silver Lake where she takes ballet and I'll just be in the

54:13.460 --> 54:17.140
parking lot I'm like people are picking up their kids and my wife will call me be like

54:17.140 --> 54:20.660
do you hear what Steve Bannon did I'm like no what the fuck did Steve Bannon do I'm in the

54:20.660 --> 54:25.300
parking lot I'm like Payser what the fuck did what the fuck did Steve Bannon do hun it's like no he

54:25.300 --> 54:29.700
thinks there's going to be this is like the fourth revolution and he wants a fucking civil war and he

54:29.700 --> 54:32.740
wants everyone to fucking kill each other so we I don't know how he's gonna make no I'm goddamn

54:32.740 --> 54:39.700
terrified and I'm a wasp I am a goy whatever you call me I'm a fucking whatever I am I'm a blob of

54:39.700 --> 54:47.940
the fucking white you're just white white person I because every time every every it's it's it I've

54:47.940 --> 54:52.340
boiled it down I'm focused I'm focusing on my own emotional reactions yeah like I bought a gun

54:52.980 --> 54:56.500
for the 10-day waiting period and I haven't picked it up yet yeah I picked it up so it's

54:56.500 --> 55:01.700
still there distracted by that so it's like Dylan's Nobel Prize but then I left it there but

55:01.700 --> 55:06.820
yesterday I was like I'm gonna go pick it up the article I read that's that made me want to go pick

55:06.820 --> 55:13.060
it up was it was it was it was this the with a barred the CNN from the thing I know for me it's

55:13.060 --> 55:18.340
about First Amendment because I perceive Steve Bannon and that whole plan I don't know what

55:18.340 --> 55:22.500
those guys the Nazi part of Trump and there's a huge Nazi part of him he's descended from the

55:22.500 --> 55:29.300
fucking that his brother in the um the the those guys are the only fortunate thing is that they're

55:29.300 --> 55:35.060
not upgrading their playbook they didn't update it for the internet it includes I look at this all

55:35.060 --> 55:41.060
this First Amendment stuff every time there's talk about laws against protesting that's fucking

55:41.060 --> 55:57.140
Jesus Christ I'm sorry I didn't put it on side I'm sorry please continue that that ring tone does not match your voice at all uh just really delicate wind chimes

55:58.740 --> 56:05.460
didn't he just tell you he has a gun he has not picked it up Dan what are the other three

56:05.460 --> 56:12.980
errands you're gonna do around the gun pickup I gotta go to Trader Joe's I gotta drop off this box

56:12.980 --> 56:18.100
at uh boss brother's gotta go pick up your gun go pick up a gun finding out you gotta get some

56:18.100 --> 56:22.740
porn too just to balance that shit out I'm using it to measure what what I'm feeling and when and

56:22.740 --> 56:28.020
what my triggers are what's going on with me because um because we're all finding out like okay we need

56:28.020 --> 56:32.420
to take this seriously how our perspectives are different how how our neurologies are different

56:32.420 --> 56:38.100
um I for me every time this First Amendment stuff comes up particularly this idea of the

56:38.100 --> 56:44.180
press as the enemy and all this stuff I perceive it as those guys like that's the velociraptors

56:44.180 --> 56:51.220
testing the fucking electric cages because they and or they're just piling up the zombies piling up

56:51.220 --> 56:57.140
against the the the the shopping mall doors and dawn of the dead like they if they could get thicker

56:57.140 --> 57:02.980
and push it down they would they because there's a Nazi playbook and it and there's a there's a

57:02.980 --> 57:08.900
fascist playbook get rid of the media playbook the media you can't go any further you cannot

57:08.900 --> 57:13.620
continue past well they'll get rid of the media whether they can or not by saying this is alternative

57:13.620 --> 57:17.620
facts this is not truth and there are people that fake news fake news they're going to contribute

57:17.620 --> 57:23.060
it's yes it's fake news yeah lugen press it's straight out of the english translation of

57:23.060 --> 57:28.500
fucking nazi terminology this is that's what they do if in the 30s it took six guys and a

57:28.500 --> 57:33.940
pair of boots to go shut down the media you tipped over a fucking press and you and you set fire

57:33.940 --> 57:40.260
to a building um the they're doing the equivalent of that and that's that makes me it's their intent

57:40.260 --> 57:45.060
you know like when a kid hits you in the nuts as hard as he can with a bat and you're like it's

57:45.060 --> 57:50.180
disturbing to you it's like there's it's separate from whether or not it hurt it's like the kid

57:50.180 --> 57:55.220
thought that he was gonna fucking hit your nuts as hard as he could with what he thinks is the

57:55.220 --> 58:01.380
biggest weapon he has in his hand and there's an offense there where you go nephew cousin whoever

58:01.380 --> 58:07.300
you are you know the fuck nuts like wait wait you don't don't do that you know those are my

58:07.300 --> 58:12.500
nuts and that's a bat um and it doesn't really matter how clownishly ineffective they've been

58:12.500 --> 58:18.500
it's the fact that what they would have when you see their intent when you see when you look into

58:18.500 --> 58:24.020
their dead eyes and see what they would see the future be would you see that's what that's why

58:24.020 --> 58:29.460
these policies are important because like they don't fucking care so another parent told me that

58:29.460 --> 58:34.020
the other day that they uh trump was on the tv and their like two-year-old kid pointed and went

58:34.020 --> 58:40.500
trump like with this just sad like the same way you would like because he's like grimace from

58:40.500 --> 58:45.220
mcdonald lander the hamburger you know it's like like the kids are learning the mythology he's not

58:45.220 --> 58:52.180
a good guy like you know i can't say it i mean there's just hatred there's just uh it's 9 11

58:52.180 --> 59:01.380
no it's not not by our clock uh we go by a really specific clock here uh anyway but but i was

59:02.340 --> 59:07.780
look i mean i there is this it's not a silver lining it's not like and i know that i know

59:07.780 --> 59:11.860
two years from now four years around what is the silver lining what is the silver lining with any

59:11.860 --> 59:16.660
crisis is always that you know it's like a forest fire it's like the silver lining with a zit getting

59:16.660 --> 59:21.780
so fucking gigantic that you can't ignore it the silver lining is that it's ready to burst um it's

59:21.780 --> 59:27.860
but it's it's the the when those graveyards got desecrated you know one of the things that i saw

59:27.860 --> 59:34.020
was a muslim group muslim group saying like hey what can we get to like you know it's it's it's

59:34.020 --> 59:40.500
the shit coming out into the open like where the funny smart progressive decent people have nothing

59:40.500 --> 59:46.980
to fear in the light and and only the bad people will they will they will continue to be more and

59:46.980 --> 59:51.860
more recognizable because they will continue to advocate for shadow and darkness they will continue

59:51.860 --> 59:56.420
to say uh everything should be secret everything there there should be boundaries there should

59:56.420 --> 01:00:00.820
be borders there should be all these things and that is going to be that could be a really healthy

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:07.700
thing for admittedly a side of the political spectrum that that in times of peace and prosperity

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:14.580
did nothing but someone brought their their chihuahua hey just sat on a duck that's fine that's good

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:19.860
wait you don't think the silver lining is that everyone who voted for trump who

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:23.060
believed that their life was going to get better their life because he doesn't give a

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:28.420
shit about them gets so much worse that and they lose their health carry and they see that there

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:31.940
is no way they lose their money lose their money and they see there's no way out but to commit

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:38.180
suicide that entire dies and then we lose those fucking people voting in the next election

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:45.860
who yeah that's called natural levelers called fucking that's human gerrymandering that's right

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:50.260
we draw a different wait did you did you see recently uh we talked about this on our other

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:55.620
podcast that uh Arnold Schwarzenegger just in a random tweet did you see this that he was like

01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:02.180
it's amazing that like when congress is less popular than like oh herpes herpes and nickleback

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:07.780
like he dragged nickleback was like whoa whoa you don't fuck with like you fuck with the nickle you

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:14.180
get the back and they came back so hard on him and they tweeted back at him like leave us out of

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:18.900
your stuff and they went after him and then he apologized like immediately look i was i was going

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:23.700
for unity uh totally and i was like wait i thought you're supposed to be a tough guy you're a tough

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:28.980
republic yeah come on man what the fuck dude i i i thought that was a strange situation because i

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:34.500
saw that video and i thought it was a really important primer or alert to the concept of gerrymandering

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:39.140
which we don't talk enough about totally but it was Arnold Schwarzenegger i know i didn't

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:43.860
retweet it because it was too i didn't want to deal with the i don't want to feel like some

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:49.220
come on dad let's go motorcycle riding and i mean he was you can retweet some more of my stuff

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:54.660
woman gropin republicans sell out also as as a republican he cut the first people who went after

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:58.900
in california with the nurses and the teachers yeah i i just like he's just another glory hat so

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:02.980
it's it would it would have distracted from the message but it was a good message like we need

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:08.500
to talk about gerrymandering yeah i agree and i love that nickleback though came back to me if

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:13.220
that was huber snake they just would have retweeted it so like hey fuck we're in a we're in a tweet

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:20.740
good friend he said they should have gone to huber snake god fucking dammit just to hear him say

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.020
only in the app store

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:35.940
only in the app store only in the app store what it what it could be me me me what if billy bob and

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:46.980
arnold like just tweeted to each other i think it would go a little something like this would you

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:55.780
ask you ask tom pettie what was in the app store i would ask him only what's in the app store

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:03.460
that would be it but it just guys touch out like remember that video do you remember the video

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:09.380
after trump like uh trump trump at the prayer breakfast was like well and you should pray for

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:13.460
schwarzenegger's ratings and then and then schwarzenegger released this video going like

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:18.900
hey donald how about this and it was like like like the the swirling things that go through your

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:23.940
head are like well first of all okay so now we're just the wcw or whatever it's like like like like

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:28.740
are these guys all with worse actors like the only thing missing is mean gene green like like

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:33.460
going like between them is that what they want but then the but then the other thing you go is

01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:40.820
like god damn it now i love arnold again because because it's like it that like charisma and empathy

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:45.860
and just faces and heads on screens is what we're so subject to and that is the whole problem we

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:51.700
got to get away from that like he groped at your heartstrings he cornered them in an elevator

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:58.900
and exactly he's he's and now he's paying for the baby that the two of you know there's too many that's

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:03.380
we're primates so we look at each other and sometimes the different people have different

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:09.300
like uh effects on us and we gotta actually we gotta grow we gotta outgrow that i'm a writer i

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:14.420
know all about like the need for heroes that we have but that's a biological impulse so is taking

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:19.620
a shit we do that in a toilet when we elect our leaders we need to have we need to like overcome

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:26.340
our urges and our urges are for like barrel-chested leaders who are smarter and more capable than

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:31.700
us and john wane this and all the stuff and like the the the democrats need to lead the charge i

01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:36.260
think i'm just being like this is not a human concept this is not an individualistic concept

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:42.340
the idea of leading 300 million people uh and then by proxy eight eight billion people i think alec

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:46.740
ball one should be our next person and he should just go back in the face of my theory well i know

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:51.300
but it's the only way we get it's the only way to go but it's almost like in the wake of our you

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:57.540
know like like those the old european countries that do still have like england like they have

01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:03.140
although they fucked up the brexit they really did we need to have we should have this popularity

01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:08.260
contest where we have a symbolic leader of this guy's taking his head so oh you must be british

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:14.100
right no you say we already have it it's the Kardashians uh you seem that concerned that that

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:18.420
if no one argues with me we're gonna revert to monarchy that's the mother fucker man yeah it's

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:23.460
a bad impulse it's a bad impulse like the the idea of a monarchy being necessary well okay of course

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:28.260
but not a monarchy it wouldn't be a necessary monarchy it would be a symbolic one the king

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:34.100
and the queen there is yeah they don't do anything they are though they satiate and urge people have

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:39.540
to go visit a museum and look at a fancy hat and say oh we're the best she's running shit there

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:44.340
there is there is this great but seriously there's this great thing where they hide it and they're like

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:48.980
no the queen doesn't have any power she's got a ton of fucking power parliament doesn't convene unless

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:56.100
she speaks so don't trip they're still in they're still in some crazy ass move i want to assure you

01:05:56.100 --> 01:06:01.940
guys i was not tripping i was not what he was tripping out there but everybody want to say the

01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:08.420
queen is not complicit but she complicit that's the fact that we would be adding one it wouldn't

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:13.300
be a powerful office we would be adding no this is that's really what we're supposed to have already

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:20.180
done we're supposed to let elected representatives and officials do some of the the grunt work and

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:24.180
we're supposed to take care of each other we're in this position now because we keep trying to hire

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:29.300
people to take us out of this position in a true american sense where we're like i want to send my

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:33.940
congressman up there to get you health care when the reality of the situation is how do we

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:38.340
bend together none of this shit would happen in the first place it's not democrats republicans this

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:46.740
shit is on that's true when did this become like go ahead and applaud yeah that's true but it's also

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:53.220
isn't it like an american tradition and right the idea that that's fucking grunt work it's civil

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:58.580
service like go represent me on capitol hill i have potatoes to farm but they really want to do it

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:02.980
when you talk to a congressman when you talk to a politician they actually really do give a fuck

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:08.980
night not not all of a lot of them do but but a ton of them are like hey man my calling was

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:14.100
building neighborhoods my calling was figuring out a way right well so we need to put like maybe if

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:20.580
each of us put 10 percent more of our day into the being represented part of representation

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:26.020
i'm saying you could you could actually take your power back if you paid attention to what was going

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:32.740
on just one block over just one block over don't don't have to become an alderman don't have to

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:37.140
become the mayor of your city but take the block to the left or take the block to the right and if

01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:42.420
everybody on a block did that shit yeah we'd be way better off than what we needed our elected

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:46.740
representatives to do it probably is a good time to bring up this thing that we're like you guys

01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:50.740
heard of this indivisible thing we talked about it i think last week maybe but but like there's

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:56.180
this thing online it's kind of a guidebook for what we're talking it includes that the idea that

01:07:56.180 --> 01:08:00.900
the sad thing is that it's sort of taking a lot of pages from the tea parties playbook because

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:07.060
it's observing the fact that a small but passionate group of people that were filled with hatred and

01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:11.700
had their heart in the wrong place still managed political efficacy just by working on a local

01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:16.500
level they showed up in droves at town halls into this shit so you can tell this this indivisible

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:20.820
playbook and if you just google it like there's an audiobook that's like an hour long that reads

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:24.980
through it in your car don't listen to this episode i give you permission to spend that

01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:31.380
hour listening to this thing it just wait whoa whoa whoa don't listen to the second hour

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:38.100
but but it's like it basically just says that i mean i like listen you know it's like it's like

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:44.740
if there's if there's not 20 people within a certain block radius of you that are that have

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:50.900
started something start started and here's how we know that's how gentrification worked

01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:55.380
was that people called the cops once they moved to neighborhoods that had crime people called

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:59.700
their friends and and had a visible presence in that neighborhood so we know that it works for

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:03.860
real estate prices the same thing could would work for each one of us trying to take it works

01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:09.620
for the school it works for schools too uh both of us sent our kids to public schools here and one

01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:12.740
of the reasons why the public schools in our neighborhood are good is because the parents

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:18.100
are fucking involved it's that simple that's it that's the end of it teachers can only do so much

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:22.500
they we have the same shitty classrooms and the shitty chairs that every other school has in the

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:27.860
city but our parents will go out in the community and raise a bunch of fucking money and put it

01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:31.780
in and be like we don't want the music teacher one day a week we gotta raise this class this fight

01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:38.420
but a great role it is to be okay with it is it is i'm gonna argue that charter because people say

01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:42.900
charter well this is a charter this is not charter this is public public okay it's a wonderful thing

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:46.900
that we can all bring the most money to the picnic and then look over at the other side of the park

01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:51.460
and see motherfucker star true but i'm not knocking that what we should have been doing was passing

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:57.380
legislation so that all california schools got completely agree completely agree or tax weed

01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:01.780
and we know that that's the thing we know people aren't people aren't fucking with this

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:07.780
fuck a bandit bandit can't fuck you up now really the truth is we we kind of let ourselves down

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:12.820
they can't i think they could really here's the bottom line you you know that churches maybe you

01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:17.700
don't but the churches are already coming up with safe houses maybe we got to go back to the the

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:21.380
days of abolition where the quakers had to hide the slaves and we got to hide people who have come

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:25.540
to this country i don't say illegal maybe that's what we got to do but god damn that's what we're

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:29.940
about to do you asked about the silver lining just real quick the silver lining is that you all know

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:35.060
how to go real slow you're getting you're getting there you know how to start this fight you know

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:39.860
how that's the silver lining the silver lining is instead of your four-dollar intelligentsia

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:44.260
now you're going to these motherfucking meetings kicking three dollars down and make some posters

01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:50.100
and showing up that's the silver lining you get to become you now more than you've ever been you

01:10:50.100 --> 01:11:00.980
before that's the silver lining now a lot of you are moved by that but and i don't want to pull

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:07.060
the wizards curtain down but brandon now pitched 1980s minimal let me tell you something about this

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:14.420
film you're still you guys said to you guys said to hollywood we want men but we want animals

but we want to be able to find it you understand so don't confuse us with a name don't be tripping

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:30.580
we want it to be simple yeah man animal boom man is an animal he is just an effective speaker

01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:34.580
that does not mean he's not telling the truth all of his ideas are both show you anything

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:45.060
everything he says this is what i'm looking for dan with these this is all i want this is the

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:51.860
voice this is the one why can't brandon be your voice coach are you i have a question to you uh

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:34.100
puberty just like a little kid and uh he uh he was on the computer and he was like the dad was like

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:37.860
what are you what are you doing over there and he's like nothing just playing this game and he's

01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:43.860
like okay then he kind of was wondering about it because he was extra quiet and he took him and

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:48.340
went and hung out with him or whatever and then he later he came back and he looked at the history

01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:53.940
the history which is this is a new thing now like the way i learned about sex was like weird

01:14:53.940 --> 01:15:00.100
hustler pages in the in the mud next to a printing factory and i don't think andy camera talking about

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:05.220
how the internet is like like oh it's a you know it's a this awful thing well it's one pipe of

01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:10.020
everything coming into your home i think you know it's like again i was by a storm drain like

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:15.540

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:38.180
and the kid the kid had searched for the word vagina oh v u c h i n a which we're not even talking

01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:48.100
to vagina anymore uh as a country the big issue and then also sexy ass yes yes yeah i gotta look

01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:48.180
time where she'll just completely stop communicating with us and then we just won't have to deal with it

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:56.260

also weirdest scene ever to show him the pat marita there's no if a cop showed up at pat marita's house

01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:15.540
when he was drunk every single thing that he said yes like real explanation of stuff that he was

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:18.980

i put on a chest protector and i let him put cops what are the problem here so you wanted to show

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:41.220
your son that just gave him a car for nothing in return sure there's no strings attached there but

01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:45.780
no i was like i haven't seen the movie in a really long time and i was like i i have to watch this

01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:51.060
with you and in case something's in it that i want to explain to you like i was trying to be there

01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:56.740
for the whole movie and i was and there was dropped an s bomb they dropped a couple of other things

01:17:56.740 --> 01:18:01.060
but the thing that he wanted me to leave the room on is when they started making out he was like dad

01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:08.020
get out of here and i was like do you need to see this alone like did he not think you were ready

01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:17.460
to see that i know that mommy and i don't kiss anymore but why are you our favorite moment in

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:22.900
the we've done stand-up on this and i now we're not going to bust into a bit but the best line and

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:28.580
i saw it tonight the best line is he makes up ralph machi the karate de karate kid makes up

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:34.260
sorry spoiler alert makes up it's not with elizabeth with elizabeth shoe at the arcade right and

01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:41.140
they're hugging they've just kissed dad get out of here i stayed uh and she goes he goes so i guess

01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:45.540
you've heard about you know about the big karate tournament tomorrow and she's like who doesn't

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:53.540
we're like yeah yeah who in southern california doesn't know about this obscure high school

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:59.140
karate tournament it's also how they met he met her on a beach by trying karate

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:05.220
sure but i ain't go out on a saturday and there's like wet wall-to-wall traffic on the 405 i'm like

01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:11.780
what bizarre junior high school jiu-jitsu exhibition is happening down in long beach to

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:16.900
cause this much of a stack up here oh exploitation movies have to they gotta buy skateboarding

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:22.660
who has it who has it uh otherwise they'd have to spend 20 minutes going once upon a time the

01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:29.380
the society didn't think karate was important uh uh they skip right to the in a world where karate

01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:35.060
is important uh but i will say elizabeth shoe i think your kid is probably experienced i think

01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:40.580
she's empirically oh my god she's mesmerizingly beautiful she's still beautiful we got to do a

01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:46.420
scene with her in uh like csi or whatever we did with her she was still beautiful and the whole

01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:52.420
time you know i yeah i that that that movie like like like like that that character coming on screen

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:57.860
it's like i that would that launched a thousand chips i mean it did it was like it wasn't ralph machio

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:03.380
we were enamored with no we identified with him and waxed on and waxed off with him but what's

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:08.580
off to her you wanted elizabeth shoe and she was like like that was the 80s and it's

01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:12.900
fucking most perfect he was like like like with the with the with the sweaters and the little barrette

01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:18.500
and the all right perfect perfect or do you watch that movie again though it's like she she plays

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:24.900
like 25 and he plays 14 and meanwhile he was 22 when they did it and everyone was like in high school

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:31.060
uh but what do you so so but this is the thing because this dad that told me about that story

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:35.700
he's like oh okay he looks at the search history for china and like and i've heard this parents

01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:39.460
over and over and over again all the stories the stand-ups and things telling stories like

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:42.980
oh they're walking and their kids on youtube and they're they've googled things and they're looking

01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:48.500
at things and it's time to it's like this ambush where it's time to have this weird talk with your

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:56.420
kid about and all of these stories end with this sort of like and so i said uh this and that and

01:20:56.420 --> 01:21:01.220
sometimes the parents is the hero of the story because they said something so fucking weirdly

01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:06.020
like navigating all these highway cones but that's as good as it gets it it's like there is no healthy

01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:11.380
like we have all of these like uh toxic ways we have all these ways that we worry about our kids

01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:17.300
learning about sex we don't have any ways that we look forward to it we have demonized it i want

01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:22.020
it to be awkward i want it to be as awkward as possible like as stand-ups i think in life or

01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:27.220
just as people who look at life and try and create you want the most if it goes smoothly if it goes

01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:31.620
really smoothly that's great then the then your life is good if it don't you think we need as a

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:38.100
society to adopt some kind of standard i think we have the most fucked up attitudes towards death

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:43.140
and loss and like yeah we're all fucked up that's all diy every step of the way wiping your ass

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:47.380
showering like yeah i didn't really everyone should have a bidet i mean but that's starting

01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:54.500
in another point but like controversial right guys i'll lay that shit down hey but i mean i just

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.700
think like we have a lot there are a lot of things that need to be changed but definitely the sex

01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:02.260
talk and the way we look at it there's a there are puritanical underpinnings and when we grew up in

01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:06.660
st louis i don't know if you felt it too i felt like it was more constricted to the bible like

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:13.220
we go and spend time in cities like denver seattle san francisco that the overall attitude of the

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:19.140
people who live there it's like way way way fucking more open about everything where we grow in

01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:24.580
st louis i feel like the puritanical underpinnings of sex made it something that is wrong and you

01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:29.140
should not do and so you're at least not talk about yeah don't talk about so if you were like the

01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:34.500
only black dude it was rough because everybody would experiment with you puritanically that's

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:47.060
right it's just taboo so fucking taboo i miss the racism of sex this is this is the good side of

01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:52.580
prohibition yeah that's everybody's still got drunk we've had i seem to remember we've had we've

01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:59.620
had women up on this stage who have really uh that's true a golden age of the podcast i remember i

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:03.380
remember a young lady coming up and telling the story about when she was in high school she was

01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:09.540
sort of you know it's a classic story and like the the the movies that we don't she was branded a

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:20.340
uh a slut essentially like like because she like she was the uh participant in early experiences

01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:25.780
of other shitheads that then punished her for that it's like it wasn't like she went out with a

01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:32.180
sandwich board and said let's do this um you know she simply was the person that or maybe she fucking

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:38.420
enjoyed it uh did not she came on the show and said oh she did not enjoy it okay no she enjoyed it

01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:42.580
fine she did not enjoy the slut label i'm not saying she enjoyed yeah maybe she just enjoyed the

01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:47.620
experiences themselves and she should be allowed to yes i mean you're not taking a brave stance there

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:59.620
we're all no jesus women should enjoy sex right am i right ladies guys no i'm sorry i jumped off

01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:06.660
the ship on this one they should be encouraged to enjoy sex my wife should be encouraged to enjoy sex

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:15.940
i'm saying that we we all end up uh dealing with young people's sexuality uh over and over again

01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:22.180
because it does become a civic matter it becomes a legal matter if some kid didn't understand the

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:27.300
difference between consent and not and that's that that becomes a criminal legal matter it becomes

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:32.660
all of our problem so we're still living in this weird time when we're like oh let my kid learn

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:39.700
about sex like however they want like whoa who would who would want some obama uh panel telling

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:44.260
you how to tell your kids about sex but there's a tube coming into everyone's home all of our

01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:51.220
kids are learning now from the same if i can aluminum hinged device that steve jobs designed

01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:55.460
like it's it couldn't be more orwellian the way our kids are learning about sex except for one thing

01:24:55.460 --> 01:25:00.820
they're not learning anything healthy no they're not learning they're not they're not actually

01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:05.380
being told at any point the thing that they're most interested in from age three forward which is

01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:09.860
where does this go and what's this for and what the fuck is this supposed to do and why does it

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:13.700
feel good let me explain but also they're not learning about intimacy either because there's

01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:18.180
none of that in any of the like videos that are on we get the same shit though they they're doing it

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:22.660
to the adults as well you know they sort of took it from all of us so it's hard for us to like

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:26.900
give it back to our kids because we're all but we're all fucked up too like the way i like if i

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:31.300
had a kid it'd be like listen get what are you doing googling that go out by the river and hunt

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:39.220

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:52.580
they do love it but the soundtrack and some of the later songs they'll drop a motherfucker and they'll

01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:59.140
drop a they drop some bad language and my kids were telling me yesterday that they loved that we

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:04.260
don't make a big deal out of the fact that we'll let them listen to that without being like you

01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:09.460
shouldn't do because we aren't on top of them for that you say it's because we cool motherfucker that's

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:16.420
right that's how you drop your voice that's how you drop your voice that's it cool motherfucker that's it how

01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:24.180
would i say it if i were you a hundred and fifty dollars sound like karson there i know i would love

01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:29.540
it if he was like thank you very much that's very they kind of had this weird discussion where they

01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:34.740
were like they were really my son was like that today when i was like when we heard some of the

01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:37.780
bad language and he was like i was like why do you want me out of the room he's like because

01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:40.820
you're going to hear something bad you're going to make me turn it off i was like i'm not going to

01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:46.340
make you turn it off but i do if we talk about it we can talk about that word and when it's

01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:52.180
appropriate to use it when it's not i'm like you could actually some kid some fucking douchebag kid

01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:56.660
and there are douchebag kids all over these three fucking kids all right so there are these douchebag

01:28:56.660 --> 01:29:03.300
kids in our neighborhood and one of them got mad at my son and for some bullshit thing and yelled

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:08.500
at him really loud and my son came in the house and i didn't think he knew he was like that mother

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:16.820
fucking piece of shit and i was like you i was so proud in a weird way that he knew that well

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:21.700
here's why i was proud i was like oh my god he knows these words and he knows not to throw him

01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:26.820
around at school or in moments where it's not appropriate and this was like he was reaching

01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:30.420
for the worst thing he could say about someone and then he had these in his cachet and i was like

01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:36.180
that's cool i thought that was very cool so like there is a way i guess that yeah bitch he does suck

01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:43.540
but that's the way to like i guess that's this kind of example of like allowing them a little bit

01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:48.180
of control in this scenario because i think going the other way where you're trying parenting you're

01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:52.420
going to do 80% wrong you're going to feel like you're doing 80% of what you're doing wrong even

01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:56.820
though you're trying to do everything right yeah i'm not i would never be really hypocritical of

01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:05.380
me to say some of it shouldn't be upon us we have we have an alphabet we have insulin we have we have

01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:16.260

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:28.820
