00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Good evening, Hollywood, California. What goes down tonight? I'll tell you what goes down.

00:21.000 --> 00:34.000
Harmontown is now in session. Here we are at the Meltdown Nerdist Melting Meltdown Theater here in Hollywood, California.

00:34.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller. Let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
A couple of lazy karate kicks I did there for you listening at home. Thank you for coming to Harmontown.

00:58.000 --> 01:07.000
Thank you, Jeff Davis, our Comptroller. What a wonderful job he does.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Well, I got nothing. I don't have anything to talk about tonight.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
That's our show. Good night. Thank you for coming, everybody.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
We did the...

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I'd like to thank...

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Mo Fathelbab? Fathalbap?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
He's the best name you can thank.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
He's the worst name. I can never remember. There's no mnemonic device for Fathalbap.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
You can never remember if it's B first or M first.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
You can say Mo Fathelbab wrong and nobody knows.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Oh, that's it. Okay. Fathalbap...

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I won't...

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Fathalbap.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
It's going to be a bad show tonight, folks.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Buckle up and...

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Mo came out of the car.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
We said it three times wrong, so he's like an insecure Beetlejuice.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Fathalbap, Fathalbap, Fathalbap.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
And he's like, I think you might mean me.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Let me help you.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I've been doing this my whole life.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
Anyways, yeah, I was nursing a well-earned hangover all day today.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
We watched like four movies in bed, Aaron and I, and Jeff.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Because we did the Channel 101 roast last night.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
It was a ten-year anniversary of Channel 101.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Some of you may not be familiar with Channel 101,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
but it's been around for ten years now.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
It's ten years old.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
I gave birth to something ten years old.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
You gave birth to something zero years old, and now it's ten.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
It's going to be a bad show, folks.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
It's just people correcting each other.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Do your baby back rib-riff one more time.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Oh, man.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
I stopped short because I was like, what are you doing?

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
I'm going to do, here, watch this.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
What's your name, ma'am?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Samantha.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Got Samantha?

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
It's like got milk.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
That's it.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
That's all you get tonight.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
So just mid-90s advertising slogan.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
Yeah.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Oh, dear heavens.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Pull it together.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
It's partly your job, though, isn't it?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
My favorite part of the roast last night,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I mean, I can't imagine many people that are here

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
were there last night, but one guy.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Adam Goldberg.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
At some point, we were all roasting each other.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
It's friends roasting each other, so that's what a roast should be.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
So good-natured, fake vitriol and spleen.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
And there was a gal in the audience who kept just going,

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
just ejaculations for no reason in the middle of the show.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And Dan got up last.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
I was the roast master and brought Dan up for the finale,

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
and Dan stopped roasting friends and just lampooned.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
No, not lambasted.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Assaulted a woman in the audience.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
And it was for the benefit of all.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
It was fantastic.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
So you missed that.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Let's do a new segment.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Do you have a song you can play a little sound by?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
What sort of segment?

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
This segment is called...

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Ask Dan a Question.

04:18.000 --> 04:34.000
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Ask Dan a Question,

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
where you, the audience, get to ask Dan Harmon a question.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
A question?

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
All right.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Good, good.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Well, maybe, hey, if you got enjoyment out of that,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
maybe it won't be a bad show.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Maybe we accidentally assembled some people

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
with very low standards tonight,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
and they're going even right out.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Or I picked the perfect musical cue.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
No, you did great.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Anybody have a question?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Raise your hand.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Deeper first. What's your name, sir?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I'm Kyle.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Kyle, what's your question?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
How are you doing?

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
The question to Dan is from Kyle.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
How are you doing?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I'm doing good.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I was a little hungover.

05:25.000 --> 05:34.000
Well, you asked a question.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I don't know yet.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
All right, one more question. One more time for one more question.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
Let's go in the back. I see the shadow of a hand.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Where did you get your haircut? It looks great.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
The question is, where did you get your haircut?

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
Addendum, it looks great.

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
Chicago.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
Next question.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Let's go with a beef fungus bill.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Beef fungus bill in the front row.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Is there any conceivable way

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Heat Vision and Jack could come back?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
The question is to Dan Harmon,

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
is there any conceivable way

06:14.000 --> 06:23.000
that Heat Vision and Jack could come back?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
That was too fast. I'm sorry.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I mean, they've been trying to,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
that's been trying to happen

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
for a really, really, really long time.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
I just watched it.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
We screened it at the Austin Television Festival,

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
and I was stricken with the fact that,

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
A, holy shit, we need to tighten those edits.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
But B, I think it really just needs to be a movie,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
if anything. I don't know.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
But then again, Schrab had a really good idea

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
for an animated series.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Every time that thing comes up

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
and is going to get reborn in some way,

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
something complicated happens.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
There's a lot of cooks in that kitchen,

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
a lot of people sharing that intellectual property.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Under the right circumstances,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
would you want it to come back?

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Well, I think you could make a really, really good movie

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
out of it.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I had a script that I wrote,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
which I'm sure it's not the best script I've ever written,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
but the idea behind the script,

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
I felt like going into doing a Heat Vision and Jack feature,

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Heat Vision and Jack kids is this thing I did in 1999

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
with Schrab.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Rob Schrab for Fox.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I was a pilot that didn't get picked up about Jack Black.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
He's a super intelligent astronaut.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
He's got too close to the sun, so his brain expanded.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
He's running from NASA with his talking motorcycle voice point.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Oh, and Wilson.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
And I always felt like if you did a movie version of it,

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
the movie version of it should be like...

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Anybody ever see Wrestler's Rhapsody?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
I wanted to have a kind of meta quality to it where,

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
like, the sort of knight-ridery, hulky,

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
Athenian, Buck Rogers' kind of fantasy quality

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
to the lifestyle that Jack and Heat Vision were caught in,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
along with its episodic nature,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
was sort of a metaphor for the Bachelor lifestyle.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
The four one settles down.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
You've got your one buddy who's like,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
are you ever going to let you settle down,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
a.k.a. like a motorcycle that can't stand still

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
or he falls down himself?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I'm sitting right here, Dan.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
And then you've got...

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
So it's like, my version of the feature was going to be that Jack,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
like, first you just do like 20 minutes of awesome,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
just like, just do Heat Vision and Jack,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
just do like an episode or two, just like wing through them,

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
and then plot point one on page 20 is Jack,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
once again, for the 500th time,

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
or he's lost count, like, once again,

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
he goes into a small town and meets a nurse

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
or an aerobics instructor or something

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
and she's having trouble with us

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
that indirectly leads to a supernatural adventure.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
But this time, like, he goes home with her

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
and he's doing the same routine over and over again

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
with just cosmetic differences.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
His life is templated and successful, syndicated, if you will.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
And then the woman's roommate comes home

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
and it's a girl that Jack did this with,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
like, five seasons ago.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
And she's like, holy shit.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
She's completely changed.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
She's going to medical school now.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
She's become a real human being

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
and this person that she knew had this dalliance with

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
who came through her life.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
He hadn't changed at all.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
And that was, like, Jack's seeing himself through her eyes

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
as a creature of habit, as a person who wasn't,

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
whose life was going through these illogical patterns.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
For instance, why are you running from NASA still?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Have you tried talking to them?

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
You know, why do you, when you find out that Bigfoot exists,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
why don't you leverage that information

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
to get people to stop chasing you?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Or just, like, why do you bother fighting Bigfoot

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
when you're on the run from these people?

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Can't you use that as an excuse to...

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
He starts asking questions that you're not supposed to ask

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
and that sort of triggers their greatest adventure yet.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
But that's probably where it falls apart

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
and that's probably why it'll never get made.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
But I would really like to see that.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I could probably just do that and not call it heat vision of Jack.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
I could call it octopus face and sock dick.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Octopus face and sock dick.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
They're best friends to the lovin'

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
and they're gonna go on some adventures

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
and find some Bigfoots, too.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
They're gonna do battle with a Loch Ness monster,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
fight a werewolf, and eat some lobsters.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
They're gonna go down to the basement with you.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
These characters are gonna fight a werewolf

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
and eat some lobsters.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
They're gonna go down to the basement with you.

11:08.000 --> 11:19.000
These characters are ready to assault you.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
Retraining my brain to not go to certain comedic wells at 40.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
That, if you're gonna do an improv song,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
that's an unforgiving tempo there, too.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
Hey man, my life's an unforgiving life.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Alright, let's...

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Oh, you have a question, sir?

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
Yeah, if you had to choose between sex or teleportation for the rest of your life,

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
what would you choose?

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
The question is, if you had to choose between sex or teleportation

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
for the rest of your life,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
which would you choose?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I mean, I would ask you your name,

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
but your new name is Segment Saver.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
Those other questions, that's amazing.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
If only everyone wanted to know something like that,

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
everyone could do a show.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
If sex or teleportation for the rest of my life...

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Meaning, if you chose teleportation, there could be no sex?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Yeah, you can't be pleasured sexually anymore.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Like, no more orgasms ever.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Yeah, you couldn't...

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Will that...

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
Will that raise my already rising risk of prostate cancer?

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
Like, because I know there's certain statistics about that.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Like, if I don't orgasm five times a week,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
like, I enter some risk group.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
But what good would teleportation...

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Let's assume no.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Could you teleport back to a time when you could enjoy sex?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
No, right?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
It's teleportation.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Dad!

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
How does it work, son?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
It's teleportation.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Is it a time machine?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Will you come over and help me reset my teleportation machine?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
It keeps blinking 12.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
I love that it keeps blinking 12.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I was about to say that too, and then realized...

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
The reference to it blinking 12 has become the new...

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Maybe back ribs.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
It's the new way of recognizing an old person.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
When we were 15, if your VCR was blinking 12,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
it meant you were 38, because you didn't know how to set it.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
And now, if you make that reference, people know you're 40.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
That's funny.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
Our VCR reference is blinking 12.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Our comedy is blinking 12.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
And nobody here knows how to reset it, because they don't know what it is.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Yeah, they're like...

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Anyways...

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
So what are the teleportation...

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Teleportation or sex?

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
Basically, you could teleport anywhere.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
You could, I guess, hold someone and bring them with you.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
You could teleport anywhere, bring somebody with you.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Or stuff, I guess.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
So I could teleport and find, like, really viral men to pleasure Aaron

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
and bring them back to the bedroom.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
And then teleport into the closet dressed as Superman and just watch.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
I guess without your penis, you could still pleasure her,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
but there's that...

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Well, that's a big thing, yeah, too.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
What was that?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Well, because if I wasn't in a relationship,

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
that would be...

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
I think that would be...

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
Teleportation at 40 is very tempting.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Where would you...

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
What comes to mind when you think of teleporting?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
To what?

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Just go in places fast, motherfucker.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Instant travel, anywhere.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
You hate travel.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Well, maybe because I don't have teleportation.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
I don't know.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Well, I guess you bring up an interesting point, I guess.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Where would you go, Magellan?

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
Well, I mean, it would be like you could teleport to the inside of a bank vault

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
and it would be effective retirement.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Okay.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
So you become jumper?

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah, you become jumper.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Yeah, but what's the point of having all the money in the world

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
if you can't enjoy sex anymore?

15:12.000 --> 15:20.000
I mean, this question is no longer a metaphor.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
Are you at 40 years old still capable of enjoying sex?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Of course.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
Well, according to my wiener, I come in stuff.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Yeah, yeah.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
That's a good barometer.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
But you'd rather give that up so you could rob banks?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I'm weighing it.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
You could just appear on a hammock in Tahiti and be there?

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
I'm trying to break it down by wondering how important is sex to me in terms of myself

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
and how important is sex to me in terms of keeping Aaron.

15:55.000 --> 16:02.000
If I thought that my ability to have an orgasm was the reason Aaron was going to stay with me forever,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
then there's also the children thing.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Like, I want to have a kid.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Oh, I can do that.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
I could teleport to Vienna and get a doctor to remove my sperm.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Or save it up before you choose.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Right.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
I mean, I'm assuming I get like a 36-hour, like, you know.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
I get to walk around like at Norton and kind of say goodbye to everybody.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Okay, so you come everywhere.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
All right.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
So you know what's going to come to that party?

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
Hey, Dan's getting teleportation instead of sex on Monday.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
He wants everyone to come to the rainbow room.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
No, thank you.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
All right.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
So let's say you, in your 36-hour window, when you've made this choice,

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
you have a doctor from Sweden save your semen in case you ever want to have a child.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
You've cleared it with Aaron and let her know that viral men will fuck her while you dress up in a costume.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
And she gets you the thumbs up on that.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
And she goes, I'll take that bullet.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
Then, okay, so you've chosen never to enjoy an orgasm again.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
But now, where are you going?

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
What can possibly make that worthwhile?

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
I mean, definitely first, Dublin.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Because the flight delays are killers.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I just pop over to Dublin.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
I don't know, it's a really good question.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
I know that there's a good way to use teleportation for a guy with a sedentary lifestyle.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
For rescue?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Oh, rescue.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Okay, all right.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
He's right.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
You know what, that's another thing to consider.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
If you have an extraordinary power, you end up getting eaten away by the responsibilities.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I mean, we all, yeah, fuck that.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
Every time you watch TV, every time there's a 9-11, you're like, fuck me.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
I gotta go teleport under rubble and bring people out.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Is teleportation always in the moment?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
There's no time to travel to it, right?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
No, it's space, not time.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
It's space, so you can just be somewhere right now.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
So if you're watching 9-11 happen, where are you going to teleport to?

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
New York, you fucking, specifically where?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
In the building?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Well, it's happening on the news.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Are you willing to come up here?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Okay, come up here, please.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
Ask him.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
He's the guy that's giving me teleportation or taking away my gonads.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
What's your name, sir?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
My name's Connor.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Connor, okay.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Have we met before?

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
No.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Oh, okay.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
All right.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Maybe when we teleported, but that's fine.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
Or maybe, maybe Harmontown fans are a type.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Todd Bishop.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Todd Bishop, yeah.

18:43.000 --> 18:52.000
For you at home, he's, yeah, he doesn't look like Russell Crowe.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
You look like a bit, you look like a young Frank Gorshan.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
If I knew who that was, I'd probably be...

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
He played the Riddler on the original Batman.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
You're blinking 12, baby.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
No, I said you guys grown...

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Hey, he was a comic on a TV show!

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Russell Crowe is a Visigoth.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
He's a big, hairy, ursine man.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
I was saying this guy's more on the Neil Patrick Harris end of the spectrum, which is equally...

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
There's a lot of handsome men that don't look like Russell Crowe.

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
I think what we found out is that you guys give Russell Crowe a little too much leeway.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I refuse to feel bad about that.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
I think...

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Connor, would you like to go out to dinner sometime?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I mean, absolutely.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
See?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
All right.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
Anyway, so in your mind, teleportation, if you did have it, is this something you've thought about?

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Yeah, this is actually weird that this got brought up tonight,

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
because freshman year of college, me and my, like, best friends would debate over this.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
And people have...

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
Most people, at first, were teleportation back when it was freshman year of college,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
but a lot of people have swayed.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Wait, you're kidding.

19:59.000 --> 20:04.000
When you were a freshman in college and you could drive nails through boards with your dick,

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
that's when...

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Oh, because you're taking it for granted.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
You're like, oh, I can give this up for anything.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Oh, my dick's always so hard, it gets in the way.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Can you believe that?

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
So give me a superpower instead, I guess that makes sense.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
And then when they turn 40, they're like, oh, my kingdom for a boner.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
But you're not 40.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
No.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
You're 25.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Two.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
22, not two.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
All right, anyway, so that's already interesting,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
but then once you think about it, I guess it makes sense.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
These young, virile men would...

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
What about women?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Have you ever asked women this question?

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
Yeah, most girls, surprisingly, choose sex and more guys,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
well, now that we're not freshmen in college,

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
most people are choosing sex, but most girls, almost 90% of the time, it's sex.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Huh.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
They all want it, huh?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Yeah.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
It was a...

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
It's good to know.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
It was one big plan.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Sex is the ultimate teleportation, man.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
And when I want to go to another place,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
I just go to bed with Dan Harmon.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
It kind of forces you to not want to be there.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
It's like I'm in a bank vault right now.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
Yeah, everyone that's been to bed with me knows what it's like to...

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
All right, but kind of...

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
...remote travel.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
Let's say there was a point in your life when you would have chosen teleportation.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I mean, still choosing it.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Just still do.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Okay, so then explain to me what the benefits, what makes teleportation.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
I want to know the rules of teleportation, too.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
If I want to go to Madagascar, even though I've never been there,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
and probably couldn't find it on a map, like...

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
See, I think we've gone back and forth on this,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
and probably thought about it way too much.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
But, I mean, it'd probably be more fun if you could just think it and go,

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
as opposed to having been there or seen it on TV.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
Like, if you don't have to have been to Ground Zero to teleport there,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
like, you can just go.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
But do I have to kind of know it's on the east coast of the United States?

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
Yeah, if you can, you can, like, just throw a dart and get close.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
That'll work.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Alright.

22:04.000 --> 22:10.000
So you could see a national crisis happening on CNN,

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
and go there and help people.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Yeah, you could.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Is that the allure of teleportation?

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
Is the greater good that you would use this as a superpower?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
I think that's part of it.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
I think that's the price.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
That's the price of admission.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Yeah.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
You could also do a lot of really fun stuff.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
Right, okay, so again, now, give me, like, forget the responsibility,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
or include whatever.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Like, think small.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Yeah.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Like, you ever drive past the public museum at night,

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
and think like, man, you know, me and my friends could just go in there with a six pack

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
and just look at a T-Rex and just hang out.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Like, you could.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah, never fuck again, but I want to see that T-Rex so bad.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I mean, fuck seeing it in the daytime.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
And not during business hours.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
No, no.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
I guess, and also they have motion sensors instead of the cops would always be coming.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
But then you could just get the heck out right now.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
You could teleport right the fuck out.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Well, let me ask you this, Connor.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Can I teleport to the moon?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
You could, but...

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
But you'd die.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
You'd probably...

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
Well, I could get a spacesuit.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
If you got a spacesuit, then I think this works.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
Yeah, and then teleport to the moon with, like, tanks of oxygen and start building a city.

23:16.000 --> 23:23.000
I hate to be a killjoy, but let's say you teleport to NASA where there are spacesuits.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
And let's say you find one that fits you.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
It already exists.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
You understand that...

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
That was not a fad joke.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
I think 200 people disagree.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
That's on them then.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
I'm saying rocket science.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
That was a fad joke.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
For instance, I'm just about six foot four inches.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
I'm not going to find me a spacesuit that fits me.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
You think those things are custom made?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Oh, fuck yeah!

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
And then also...

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
No, no, no, no.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Team Taylor fit?

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
No, you get them off the fucking rack.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
No, I know.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Yeah, but you want...

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
You get a Neiman Marcus and you say, I'll take a...

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
But when you set these guys up in the spaceship, don't you want all of their suits to fit all of them?

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
I'm pretty sure Buzz Aldrin's suit was Buzz Aldrin's suit and fit him like a glove.

24:13.000 --> 24:22.000
But I bet they would be stupid to not let him be able to go, hey, like Neil Armstrong has a peanut allergy and he dies halfway up.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
And he lands on the button that makes the spaceship go to Venus instead of the moon.

24:26.000 --> 24:37.000
And then Aldrin's suit gets all fucked up because whenever Glenn Beck, I don't know the name of another astronaut,

24:37.000 --> 24:44.000
he starts eating shit like a moth and tears a hole and so the bottom line is, like, who's...

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Okay, all right, so let's say...

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
What do we do?

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
The answer better be, okay, there's another space suit.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
I will grant you...

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Okay, how about this?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Let's say you roll...

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
You bowl a strike and you go in there and you have short Vince Vaughn's space suit in there.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Because he's still a little chubby.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
And you go up, this is Goldilocks.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
This one fits perfectly and you try that on.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
A team of people need to make sure that thing works.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Like, you can't just put that thing on and sustain you.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Yeah.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
Like, again, I'm only asking these questions so I can find out whether...

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
All right, so I teleport to NASA.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
I steal a space suit and you're going to give me this that they got one there.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
That one fits just right.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
Why don't you bring just both suits so it's not even an issue?

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
What do you mean?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Like, bring the non-fitted suit and then the fitted suit.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Well, let's say you had ten suits that were all perfect.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
You walk into a giant wardrobe full of space suits and you can just pull them off the rack.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I'm a 42 long, that's perfect.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
You get right in there.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
So you have the suit.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Now you need...

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
This is not something that can operate on its own.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
You need help on this, right?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
On a space suit on the moon.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
If we're going to the moon.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I don't know, do you?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Well, I mean, you could certainly figure that shit out.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
The hard part of getting to the moon is propulsion.

25:53.000 --> 25:59.000
Well, also, to put an EVA suit on in a spacecraft, you need like two people to help you get in.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
I will have lots of friends.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
I believe the teleporting guy.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
But they don't work for NASA.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
And a lot of those friends will be super hot chicks because they won't feel threatened by me.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Because I won't be able to...

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
I will have so many fucking awesome, smart, hot women friends.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
But they're going to be turned down by the fact that you're going to murder yourself on the moon

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
because you don't know how to operate a fucking space suit.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I don't understand your...

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Well, I haven't even made a decision yet.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Okay, Connor.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
It seems like as long as...

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
It seems like you're happy as long as I'm coming.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
Dan, I've always been candid about that.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
Connor, give me your, like, top three, five.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
Rift some of your top five or whatever teleportation moments.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Like, what would you want to do?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Holy crap.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Yeah, you've thought about teleportation a lot.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Too much.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Yeah.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
Or you can steal ones from your friends.

26:49.000 --> 26:56.000
I guess the question that people always ask right then is can you teleport your dick into a girl's vagina?

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Which...

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Doesn't make sense.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
It's also called rape, I think.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
Dan, Dan, Dan, don't.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Is that a rape joke?

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Dan, don't.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
It was not a rape joke.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I really, I seriously want to know.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
Can you joke about rape jokes?

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Can you make a rape joke joke?

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I can because I'm not famous.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
You can't.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
I called my grandma a nigger in that show and nobody cared.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
That's right, how's that going to play in HuffPo?

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
By the way, Jeff Davis dropped an n-bomb too in that show.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
Now are you clicking on us?

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
You're right, it's all about the headline.

27:40.000 --> 27:46.000
Okay, so give me your, what's the pie in the sky teleportation?

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
I don't know, it's never been something so specific,

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
but it'd probably just be so much like funny shit to like fuck with people.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Just pranks.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Yeah, all the time.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Like that would be so fun.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
Yeah, you know what else was fun?

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
Cummin.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
But I, yeah, I wonder what would make Aaron happier,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
my wiener or...

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
You leaving him dying on the moon.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
I'd see him alone with all that money.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
I could take her to Hawaii, I could take her to...

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
The moon.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
I could take her to the moon if we find a space suit designed for, you know,

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
Fomky Johnson.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
What?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
All right.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
I'm still, I mean, I'm only playing devil's advocate here.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I want to be sold on teleportation.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
Anybody else out here have a good teleportation idea?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Instant skydiving.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Instant skydiving.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Oh, right.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Just remember to teleport before you hit the ground.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Right.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Or before you black out.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
Yeah.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Yeah, that's because you could always be falling.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
That would be fun.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
That would be good.

28:54.000 --> 28:59.000
I would say this would probably be great for people that have passed their sexual prime.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
I think a lot of people would choose this at the age of, like, you know, 58%.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
You've got, like, Betty White teleporting around.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
Yeah, Betty White would just be Robin Banks stealing everything.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
There's something about the security, too, also because I'm becoming a doomsday prepper.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
I've decided.

29:13.000 --> 29:21.000
Like, that's, if you could teleport, you don't need to waste any energy doomsday prepping.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
You know, you are prepped for doomsday because you're set.

29:25.000 --> 29:30.000
Like, you're all the more secure in an event of Armageddon.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Like, it doesn't matter.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
You wouldn't need a bomb shelter.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
You wouldn't need anything.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
You could just, like, now you could just hang out.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Like, they could go in the news today.

29:38.000 --> 29:47.000
Gold dropped three silver points and the Russians are threatening to invade Afghanistan again.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
And your friends would be like, oh man, should I buy a shotgun?

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
And you'd be like, I don't care.

29:54.000 --> 30:00.000
They'd be like, kind of like being Highlander except you'd get to die at 60.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
Was teleportation your ultimate superpower or are there other ones that are better?

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Or would you pick that because it might balance the scales?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
I think it's a good balancer.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
What would be your ultimate superpower if you could have one gift?

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
I mean, maybe teleportation because I don't want to waste all the time I thought about it.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
But I could at least just throw that out there to make sure that I cover myself.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
But invisibility, flying, all that stuff's cool.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
But teleportation is like flying, I guess.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
What would be your big power, Jeff, if you get to choose one?

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
I've thought about this with Matt Groly.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
We talked about superpowers that are super.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
Like you could fly or you have super strength or invulnerability or whatever.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
There's also mundane superpowers that you can speak every language.

30:45.000 --> 30:51.000
The rule is you can't become a real criminal and you can't do great good with it.

30:51.000 --> 30:56.000
So you can pick something that's kind of cool but you couldn't commit a crime by having that power.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
So if I had a superpower, I'd definitely flight.

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
If I had a mundane power, speak every language, be able to talk to anybody in the world.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
I think that would be very cool.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
That would be cool.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Yeah.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Maybe you could have both and you'd be like that.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
Oh, look, it's flying snob.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Bonjour!

31:13.000 --> 31:19.000
Every time you conjugated wrong in French or something like that.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
More Beaujolaises even play it.

31:21.000 --> 31:26.000
You land and go like, it would be Seal L play because she's a woman.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
Away!

31:33.000 --> 31:40.000
Also, I thought it'd be really cool if you had the power to just be in a room full of people and just go...

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
Until you're enough that you just got groaning and everyone looks at you and just boom!

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
It burst into a pulp of hot blood and meat.

31:50.000 --> 31:56.000
I just go, poof! I just like cover the walls and there's just flesh and brains all over everybody.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
And after everybody stops screaming, reform.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Why are you embodying that?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Why are you encouraging him?

32:12.000 --> 32:18.000
I think there's three other people that want that power and two of them got the electric chair.

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
Like you, Connor, I've given mundane superpowers a lot of thoughts.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
Another one is the ability to jump out of any window.

32:26.000 --> 32:31.000
It could be out of this window here at Meltdown or out of a plane or out of an Empire State building.

32:31.000 --> 32:36.000
And jump out of a window and immediately reappear behind people that are looking at the window.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Here's a guy, mundane one.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
I think we talked about this, the ability to manipulate any printed language.

32:43.000 --> 32:50.000
If you just drive past a billboard and it says, by Levi-G, you could just make it say, go fuck yourself.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
Like in the same fonts.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
You could just put Alan Thicke's face up there and there's a dog on his dick.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
You just wave your hand and it's like, I don't know what you call it.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
I am Photoshopper.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I am Adobe.

33:08.000 --> 33:13.000
Like when they look back though, it's back to normal and they just really fucked up by the end of the day.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
You could change a Hollywood sign but for 10 seconds.

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess that's fun but then you're just making a bunch of people think they're crazy.

33:21.000 --> 33:27.000
If you could change billboards and then everyone was like, you gotta go up and change that.

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
I think that breaks my rule of you could use that for evil. You could change the constitution.

33:32.000 --> 33:38.000
You could easily be like super banksy. You could be like subvert the government.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
You could change serial numbers on money. You could use that for evil.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
Well, that's the cool. I just watched one of the four movies we watched in bed today was X-Men First Class,

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
which is awesome by the way. I guess I'm the last to know that.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
I didn't bother to watch it because there wasn't a big hubbub.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
But I guess when you're 40, the hubbub doesn't reach you.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
It's just 18-year-olds. Their hubbub is contained amongst each other.

33:59.000 --> 34:04.000
They're probably at the sock hop going, X-Men First Class was great.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
And then I'm just driving by in my Prius and I don't even hear it.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
It's not like they're going to flag down the car. Hey, old man, you should go see X-Men First Class.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
And then do a hula hoop with us.

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
But I finally watched it today with Aaron and it was really swell, really groovy.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
To quote them in the movie. To use their parlance.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
12, 12, 12.

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
But I thought, do you guys like X-Men First Class?

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
It's like a hootenanny, but with just a movie.

34:36.000 --> 34:41.000
Dan, mundane, can't use it for evil, can't use it for good superpower.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
Well, I really like the font one, really.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
Just because if you really can't use it for gain.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
If it's conceivable to use that to rob a bank or to commit a crime.

34:53.000 --> 34:58.000
Well, that's why I thought of X-Men First Class is because the cool thing about these X-Men movies, the X-Men mythology,

34:58.000 --> 35:03.000
is that if you can think of it and then you really commit to it, if someone's born with it,

35:03.000 --> 35:08.000
you reveal that this person has figured out how to use it for good or evil when it does it.

35:08.000 --> 35:14.000
So let's just say I can't use my photoshopping ability for good or evil.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
I can only use it for entertainment. I think that's a big one for me.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
Because if we could just be in a restaurant, I guess you'd get bored with it.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
I would just slide the menu over to you and go, I think Special Number 3 is right up your alley.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
I don't want the dick and balls to happen.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
I had that last night.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
Connor, you had a moment to think about this mundane superpower.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
The mundane one? I've been trying to think right now.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
It's a tough one. If anybody out in the audience has one, in the front row, yes, Miss?

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Just hover above the ground like two inches.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
Two inch hover. David Blaine.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
Two inch hover is good because it's cool, but who gives a shit?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Exactly.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
What about control over insects?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
You could commit a crime with that.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Stand in the middle of your garage and go, whew!

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
And all the roaches kind of just line up in a grid.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
Aquaman but for insects?

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
I can conceive of ways that you could use that power.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
Can you conceive of any? Go with that challenge though.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
There's a way that you could, I mean, there's no such thing as a power.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Exploding into a pulp on people and then reforming.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
Society is defined by that. Of course you could use that.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
You could go, for instance, everyone give me a million dollars or I'll come to your party.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Like no one wants you to do anything.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
And they'd say, why? Go blow up my stuff.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
I'm the pulp guy. Have you Google me?

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
And they'd go, it's cool, but when the death settles, he's just there.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
That's the problem with that one is because once you've done it a few times, then word gets out.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
But the window thing would always be great.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
Because you'd always find somebody like, oh, World Trade Center.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
That building's gone. Let me pick a better one.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
I was just trying to pick a tall one.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Flashin' 12, National Tragedy Flashin' 12.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Teleport, teleport.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Yes? You got one?

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
If you could change your hands into tools.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
If you could change your hands into tools.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Yeah, yeah.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
You just want to move the baby gate and you're like, where's the number eight socket?

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
And then you're just like, yeah.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
That would be awesome.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
Yeah, but could you use that for like lock picking stuff like that?

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
Is it all tools or do you get like a leather man on your index finger?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Can I point something out to you, Jeff, though?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Yeah.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Damn, we're just spitballing.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Yeah, I know.

37:23.000 --> 37:29.000
But you are hung up on this idea that there's such a thing as a power that normal people don't have

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
that can't be bent to a person's advantage.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
Society is defined by the fact that no one has an edge.

37:36.000 --> 37:41.000
If anyone that does have an edge has used that edge to gain power over people.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
And so if you could change your hands into tools.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
See, that to me gets into super power.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
That's plastic man.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
You're not listening to me.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
All powers are super powers.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
Like David Copperfield can't even actually do anything.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
He can only make it look like he does some stuff and he's rich and famous.

37:58.000 --> 38:05.000
I'm only using that as a level to say like you can't cross over into something actually useful.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
He's not listening to me.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
He's not listening.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
It's like talking to a wall.

38:09.000 --> 38:14.000
People keep saying, people are going like, oh, I want a fishing pole for a dick.

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
And you're going like, wow, I don't know if that counts because you could catch so many fish that you could like...

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
No, that one counts.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
That one works.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
No, you cannot rob a bank with a fishing pole dick.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Is that, is robbing the bank the litmus test?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Let's call it that, yes.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Okay, fine.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
Anything you can't rob a bank with.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Or commit like a major crime with.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
I can commit a major crime with a fishing pole dick.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Let's hear it.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Let's hear it.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Okay.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Fade in.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Okay.

38:40.000 --> 38:46.000
I come up to you and I go, hey, can I have your social security number?

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
No.

38:47.000 --> 38:53.000
Can I have it if I have a fishing pole for a dick?

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
You know what?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
All right.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Sip.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Whoa.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Where's my money?

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Yeah.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Yeah.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
And I usually, I fished it out of your pocket with a, I don't know.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
If you're always able to correct someone in a conversation.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
If they're wrong, you go, oh, no, actually it's this way.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
You couldn't use that for evil.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
They're like, oh no, this guy was born in this year.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
You're like, without looking at your phone, without looking at Google.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
So just the smartest person in the world.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
And we don't know it until someone says the wrong thing.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
And you're like, well, actually it's this.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Oh, so you don't know everything.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
You just know when someone's wrong.

39:28.000 --> 39:36.000
You just, you just have like the, like it's like word, word puts a red squiggly line underneath anything that anyone says.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
It's called a super asshole.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
In a room full of scientists and they all just like go through a bunch of statements.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Oh, yes.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
Beef fungus bill says that a team of evil geniuses will pull them in and chain them to a chair.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Yeah.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
They won't say things until like.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Yeah, they won't use them as the magic mirror.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
You know, mirror, mirror of them all.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
You've been undone.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Youster had been undone by beef fungus bill.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Yeah, back there.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
Yeah, you can control what other people's food tastes like.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
You can control what other, wow.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
Control what other people's food tastes like.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
That's fucked up.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
Mr. President, did you enjoy your roast beef sandwich last night?

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
It tasted like poop, but.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
Like will again, unless.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
Mount Rushmore is.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
My face four times.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
I'll eat poop until I die before I see that happen.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
Well, good.

40:33.000 --> 40:39.000
I don't think, I don't think the OPEC will feel the same.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Yes, you sit over there.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
You could turn into a duck, but you would have the brain of a duck.

40:44.000 --> 40:49.000
Would a duck be able to control turning back into a human?

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
There's just a clock on it, I assume, right?

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
It's like, it's like one of those light switches in cheap bathrooms where.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
It's a dial.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
I'm going to turn into a duck and then he does a gig, a gig, a gig, a gig.

40:59.000 --> 41:04.000
You're a duck and that's just walking around wanting to have sex with ducks

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
and fly south if it's cold.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
It's like five, five minutes of duck.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
Just don't go near like a fancy restaurant because that'd be bad news.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
Or be like near people with shotguns and stuff.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
But here's a big, I would do this one.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
I would say you could be a duck, you could set the timer on it.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
Like you could say I want to be a 10-second duck or a 10-minute duck or whatever.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
But you would do whatever the duck would normally be doing,

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
but you would have your eyes, like you'd be seeing through the duck's eyes.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
So you could fly and you could be in a pond and you could fuck another duck

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
and you could eat breadcrumbs and shit.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Like John Malkovich, like at the beginning of being John Malkovich.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
You could eat breadcrumbs, you guys.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
Dan, he picked duck. I didn't pick duck.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
That is the front you could eat breadcrumbs.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
B. Funkus Bill says what?

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
What if you're flying and the timer runs out?

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
You turn back into you, you just come back into your own body.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Yeah, while you're flying?

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Yeah. No, no, no.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
You basically just transport your soul into a duck,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
but you can't control the movements of the duck.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
I'd go for that, right?

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Yeah?

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
So you just be like,

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
Callie?

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Just like an obvious one.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
You could be constantly drunk and high with no repercussions.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Constantly drunk and high with no repercussions.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Could you, like, turn that off, or do you want to turn that off?

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
No, but it's like you can't turn it off.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Okay.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Where's your power?

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
It's just to be fucked up all the time.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
But with no repercussions.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
That's within reach. You can have that.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Come on, let's go.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
We've got other stuff we've got to do.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
You can control the length of all your body hair at will.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
That's practical.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
And you can't rob a bank.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
You can control all the hair on your body at will.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
The length of it.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Well, you could maybe grow a mustache

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
and not have a mustache.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Okay, open a bank account as a mustache guy,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
and then you're like,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
if my cousin comes in here,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
let him rob you.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
He won't have a mustache.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
I don't know how banks work.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
I haven't been in one for years.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
All right.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Connor, everybody.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Segment Saver.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
We should have Connor come.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
You think, are you a person

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
that's obsessed with teleportation sex questions,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
or are you a person that could come up

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
with one of those quandaries each week?

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
I feel like I could do that

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
if I put my mind to it.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
We'll give you a shot next week.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Maybe we'll put that on our notepad.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
We'll have Connor's question.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Connor's question.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
And if your name was Tony,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
we wouldn't do it.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Because Connor sounds like a...

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
There's no literature.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
I don't know. He sounds like he could be like a villain.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Just a riddler.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
He does look like Frank Gorshan.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
That's what it is. He does.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Look at Frank Gorshan. I'm gonna Google that.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
You don't know? No.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
He's a great Bert Lancaster impression.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
12.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
12.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
The young eat the old, man.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
But what are they left with?

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
100-degree weather

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
and a bunch of shitty comic book movies.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Good luck.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Have fun.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
I'll be laughing at you

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
through the worms in my eyes.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
I had Night Rider.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
It was a thing.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Night Rider was pretty good.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I mean...

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
If you go back and check

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
a lot of those episodes,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
these lumberjacks are so corrupt.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Uh...

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
You know what?

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I want to go back and watch the original A-Team series.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I'm pretty sure it's still good.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Because George Pappard,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
a really good actor,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
wore cowboy boots.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Somebody put him in a dirt pit

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
and they left him in the pit.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
And they took his boots as a kind of final insult.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
And then the rest of the A-Team found him

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
and he was in the pit and he's got a cigar

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
and he's down there in his little cargo jacket.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
They're hunting vests.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
And I guess Mr. T

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
or someone looks down at him and says,

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
what happened?

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
He goes, it took my boots.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Nobody takes my boots.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
And I believe they went to commercial on that.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
That to me is what TV keeps.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
They took his boots.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
And then he kicked everybody's ass.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
A lot of that stuff doesn't hold up, though.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
I mean, the thing in your head

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
is so much better.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
You go back and...

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I've talked about it before.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Don't go back and watch the Goonies.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
I'll just bum you out.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Just hang on to your Goonies in your head.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Beautiful, wonderful adventure.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
It's going through tunnels

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
controlled by dead pirates.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
You don't want to go back and watch that thing

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
with a human brain.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Alright, we're going to bring a special guest to the stage.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Jeff, do you remember when we were at the Egyptian Theatre

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
after our Harmontown tour?

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
We did a three and a half thousand hour show.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Yeah.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
It just ended a couple days ago.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Part of it was we had special guests

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
that were Kickstarter donors

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
to the show itself.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Got to come up and play

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Dungeons & Dragons with us.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Yes, I do.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
One of those guys is here tonight

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
because I was having drinks with him

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Friday.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
He was

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
bummed out about how it went down

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
at the Egyptian.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
I guess Spencer told him to...

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Why don't we bring him up?

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
There's a little bit of a conspiracy

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
happening here.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Can you guys please welcome Roy McClurg?

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Thank you for coming again.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Roy, I saw you backstage

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
but I didn't place you from that show.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Roy is here with his lovely life

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
which consists

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
of him and his lovely wife Penny

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
who I

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
wrapped about

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
doing it with on stage

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
because she wasn't a fan of the podcast.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
I don't think she's here yet.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
I think she's just making up the fact she was coming.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Let's do it again.

47:08.000 --> 47:14.000
Penny! Fuck yeah!

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Roy is kind of...

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
You're from Dallas, Texas.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Two of you.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Good.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
You're up here again.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
You were just in San Francisco, right?

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Yeah, last night.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
You're producing some jazz album.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
I'm working with a jazz artist to help him

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
get his new album off the ground.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
I'm here with his saxophone

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
and play hot, steamy music for us.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Well, I've got him on here if we need it.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
If anybody wants to get hot and steamy.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Can I plug in and play some of that, Roy?

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Absolutely.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Do we have clearance from your friends?

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
We have clearance. What's his name?

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
You have to go off the...

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Oh, this is porn.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Roy, you had to be Asian boys.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
It wasn't supposed to be that.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
How do you know those aren't jazz musicians, Jeff?

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Are you that racist?

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Are you that racist?

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
They weren't holding flutes.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
And they weren't using them improvisationally.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
They didn't recapitulate the original melody

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
and creative out their ways.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Jazz.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
So, when you got to the Egyptian

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
and you kicked in some money

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
that we used to produce

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
the Egyptian show

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
for the right to come up

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
that was your Kickstarter reward

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
was that you got to play D&D.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
So then it was you and the other guy.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Who's the other guy?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Was it Sean Sakame?

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Thank you.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I forgot.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I did not name him.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
That's his Twitter handle.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
But you guys then...

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
You said he came up to you.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Well, we were in the green room before the show

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
and he was handing us our character sheets.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
I had never done it, ever.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
I was so forward to it except for listening

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
to Harmontown.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
So he gives us the sheets

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
and we're reading over all these spells.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
I had these nasty spells.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
And he says, you know, and if you guys

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
want to kill somebody,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
go ahead.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
To me, I took that as

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
he wants us to kill somebody.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
We were about 30 minutes trying to devise

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
how to kill somebody, who to kill.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
And even during the show, we're sitting

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
in the front row going, okay, now who?

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
How are we going to do this? What are we going to be?

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
And it went back and forth, back and forth.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
And when we got on stage, we completely

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
just crapped ourselves.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
And what transpired was, I mean,

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Jeff and I were six sheets to the wind.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
I was sober.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
That was probably one of the most insane

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
D&D sessions ever.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
I think the characters just ended up sitting

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
and alternately attacking each other.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Right.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
And then being like, hey, play it cool.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
No one knew what the hell was going on.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
I got to a point where all I did was

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
look at the sheet and see the spells I could cast

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
and go, uh, inflict

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
moderate damage.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
And that's all I said. And he'd have to

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
prompt me on who. I didn't know.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
I just pointed this way.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
So I told Roy, you should come down

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
on Sunday and we should play D&D again

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
because he was...

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
He's a grown man.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
It's not going to affect the rest

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
of his life, but I could feel that

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
you were looking back on the Egyptian show

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
and going like, I think I did something wrong.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
No, I was looking at it that I drank

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
too much.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
I remember that moment very well.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
And I couldn't think of a better way

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
to underscore the emotions that were going on

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
than Michael LinkedIn's track,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Heat.

50:48.000 --> 50:54.000
Heat.

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
Heat.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
Heat.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
The lights have gone down.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
So this is what they listen to

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
in Texas, huh?

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Okay, I got to defend him. They listen to him

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
everywhere.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Everywhere. Listen to Michael LinkedIn

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
pick up his CDs. He's got seven of them.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
All right, so

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
I want to bring Spencer up

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
so we can hold...let's continue

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
this dialogue. Spencer, are you

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
here? He's coming.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
He's coming.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Hey everybody, welcome

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Spencer Crittenden to the stage.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Oh yeah, you listen

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
into the cool sounds of Michael LinkedIn.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Is that what it was?

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Yeah, yeah.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
You go into the Northeast Passage

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
a moss-covered wall

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
yields two exits.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
For those of you

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
with low light vision tonight,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
you're going to see a couple tripwires.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
This is sexy.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Sexy Spencer.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Spencer, can you

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
when we start D&D, will you do all the

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
the exposition as sexy

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
jazz guy? I could try that.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Yes, you're going to try it, my friend.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
You're going to try it. All right, Spencer

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
let's...why

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
did you tell? I was in danger

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I thought I was going to be misrepresented

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
but he played it pretty straight.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
That's pretty much how it happened. You tell people

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
to kill us?

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Would you feel comfortable admitting

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
how much you kicked in on that kickstarter

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
on the Egyptian?

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Couple bucks?

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Yeah, if you pay a couple bucks

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
anyone who pays a couple bucks

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
I'd say deserves a chance

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
to if not kill someone

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
at least attempt to kill

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
a pretend version of them

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
on a stage show.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
I think we tried to kill each other pretty hard

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
for about 45 minutes. I wouldn't say it was that hard.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
You guys

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
you guys...wait

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
are you going to try to kill us again tonight?

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
He didn't tell me to.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
I never told you to. I just said

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
feel free if you'd like to. It's like the Jedi

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
mind trick he said. If you'd like to kill them

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
you want to kill them, don't you?

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Yeah, I did say it like that.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
All right.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Well, let's get our...

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Let's get our other D&D players

53:28.000 --> 53:38.000
Kumail Nanjiani and Erin McGathy out now.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
You can say it. I'll just stand.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I could stand here.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
No, you...

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Okay.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I'm okay standing.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Oh, yeah. We need another mic.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Oh, yeah.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Ooh.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Here, Aaron. There's a gold mic for you

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
or Dan?

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
May I describe my everyday

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
superpower?

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Dan?

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Yes, yes.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Jeff mentioned that I immediately

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
knew what it was because I think I've thought about this

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
for a long time.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
I would like to

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
smell like a childhood

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
memory of whomever I'm talking to.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
At will, I can decide

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
who, like, if I'm talking to somebody,

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I'm like, ah, a little too much

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
than I don't smell like anything.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
But, like, if I really want to please somebody,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
I immediately smell like

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
the plastic balls of Chuck E. Cheese

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
or whatever, and they immediately associate me

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
with something positive, and it's more than

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
someone just liking me.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
So, just pee.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
If that's what it is.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Immediately, I'm

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
familial and important

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
in someone's life, and they respect me.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I would,

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
if I could pick a superpower for you, it would be

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
the least weird

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
pronunciation of the word important.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Aaron, would you say

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
you want to be important?

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
I mean, okay.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Just say it casually.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Just go, you know what's really important to me?

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
My relationship with

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Dan and my friendship with Jeff are both very

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
important.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
That's not how you say it.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Important.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Important is really good.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
I like it.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
I like important.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
I think it's important

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
to wait am I exaggerating it now?

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
No, it's fine. Also, Colin was

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
so great up here, but did you just

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
honor her?

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
I can't believe you guys don't know who Frank Gorschen is,

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
by the way. We're in the back of a comic

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
bookstore. I just think it's very important

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
to know people's names.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
I'm sorry. She pronounces

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Colin, though, as part of her mispronunciation.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Yeah, you guys remember everything.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Connor was great up here,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
but did you just ask him to do a game corner

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
every week?

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Is that kind of what happened? I mean, that's really cool

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
and really awesome. And Connor, if you want

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
to van away to your game corner,

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
I can hold up a sign with either thing.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
No, we're good.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
It was more of like a fire starter,

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
like kind of topic

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
he'd be providing,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
I think. Yeah, it's just like a quick thing.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
It's still a game. It's still

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
something that I could do.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
You don't own games.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
I know I don't own games.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
I wonder what it would smell like to you,

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Jeff. What? I don't know.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
No.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Probably your mom's freshly washed

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
hair or something. That's not an insult.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
My mom's dead, too.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
My mom's also dead.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
You're so important. Can I tell you what my

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
mundane power is that won't hurt anyone?

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I would want to beat the rock for five minutes

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
to control him,

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
like being general garbage.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
No, I don't even care if I have no agency.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
I just want to see how people see the rock.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
And it could be any five minutes

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
a day, if it's once it's like

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
rock taking a dump, then I'm like,

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
now I know what it feels like to be the rock

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
taking a dump.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
You know, he came up with a community

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
writer's room. For some reason we were talking

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
about the Flintstones. And then one of the

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
writers said,

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
do you think that

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
the rock

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
in the modern reboot of the Flintstones

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
would his name just be

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
the everything?

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
And I peed a little, because

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
those aren't the kind of jokes that go

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
into community, but we

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
have a lot of fun. They keep the room up.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
We hired some smart, funny people.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I think the rock looks

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
like if all the race is fucked.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
The rock looks

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
like the future. He's biracial, isn't he?

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
He's something like part Samoan,

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
part, I don't know, what am I?

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
He's part something,

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
part something, and he's definitely yet

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
another piece of evidence that

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
what do they call it?

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Interracial, mixing.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Right.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
There was

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
a fancier word for

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
get out. That's the opposite of the fancy

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
word for that.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
It is not

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
miscegenation, sir.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
There's also a really fancy word for Brazil nuts,

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
I can't remember.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Sir, could you?

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Whatever, anyways. We had a guest a long time ago.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Did we ever air that, or was that back before

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Harmony Town aired? That might be pre-pop.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
We had a guy who wrote a book about

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
how biracial people are

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
healthier, the idea

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
that biracial people are physically healthier,

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
and in fact more attractive

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
to us. For sure, I mean I've seen

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
biracial babies and they're gorgeous.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
And it was based on the attractiveness

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
thing, how do you measure attractiveness,

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
and for him it all boiled down to

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
symmetry. You can actually measure

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
the amount of symmetry in your face.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
It was

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
pop science, I mean the guy wasn't like a

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
qualified scientist, but he wrote a very interesting

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
compelling book about this thing. So not a qualified

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
scientist is not a scientist.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Right.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
He was a guy with opinions.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
He was a guy that researched and wrote a book.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
He looked a bunch of like biracial kids and was like

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
these are pretty cute. Yeah, I mean it was

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
kind of like, the back of the book was like

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
isn't Holly Berry hot?

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
I mean look at it, most of the

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
words are just look at this one!

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
It's just pictures of babies.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Benjamin Bratt, yum, yum!

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Yeah, Tiger Wayne

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
is kicking ass. Yeah, me likey.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Over and over.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
There's some biracial guy under a bridge

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
somewhere eating out of a

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
bed going like, yeah it's great.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
We're all super human, go fuck yourself.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
I think this might sound a little

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
non-PC, but any non-Asian race

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
with any Asian race, those babies,

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
first of all Asian babies already

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
are like so cute.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Like take it down a notch,

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
you're making the rest of us.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
I see an Asian baby sitting there

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
wooing. And Roy,

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Roy, we're not talking about

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
your internet history, we're not talking about

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
those kind of Asian babies.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Then they were babies.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Didn't you look?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
They had their flutes.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Maybe they don't have flutes.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Asian with

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
non-Asian, who's a classic celebrity?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Well, I think

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
who's a classic celebrity?

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Tyson Beckford is half black

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
and half Asian and he looks like

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
it makes him believe in God again.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Lucy Liu is

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
half Asian and half white and

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
she's very beautiful.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
This is the book, we're recapping the book.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
It's chapter 3, Lucy Liu.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Right? It's just right?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Who's with me?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
The index of his book is

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Lucy Liu,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
You Go Girl,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
32, 49.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Alright. My real, I'll tell you what my,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
yes, you have a, what, I don't know.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
You have a problem?

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Here's, we just let them run rampant.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Go ahead.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
We have a hand up in the front row.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I actually wanted to say

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
that I made some D&D themed

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
gifts for everybody here.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Oh, somebody made

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
D&D themed gifts.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Oh, nice. She's brought gifts that are

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
D&D themed for us.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Oh, is it gift time?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Is Seek here?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Are you here?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Can you come up here while she's

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
here? Yeah?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
You sound like you're locked in a chest.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Do you want to wait till later, Seek?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Adam Goldberg.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
While he comes up,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I can say this, are we waiting for him to come up?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Oh, he's here. Yeah.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Seek is a long time Armenian.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
He's been struggling with

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
he's an aneurysm survivor

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
and did a Kickstarter

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
to do this comic book about

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
a superhero who knows

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
his days on earth are numbered

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
and is seeking to go and like

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
make amends with all his super fillet.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
It's a great idea. It's pretty amazing.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
How can we talk about anything else

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
again ever?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
He brought

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
copies of the book that he wanted to

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Sorry, you got overshadowed.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Like, I brought cupcakes.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Yeah, well, he survived

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
an aneurysm.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I love

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
cupcakes.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
No, actually what I brought was something a little bit rarer

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
than the book. We sold out of the book

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
thanks to Dan's support. I don't know if you guys know,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
but on his birthday,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
he donated to the book

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
and made it possible and it's been

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
my dream to make a comic book

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
and ever since I was eight years old

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
and he made it possible.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
And then he tweeted to you guys to donate too

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
and a lot of you guys donated.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
On his birthday, which I thought was

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
made the whole book worth it. So what I did was I made a very

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Yeah, I had candles to blow out that day.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
But what I did was I made

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
a very special print.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I lost my

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I had a lot of damage to my temporal lobe,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
which means a lot of my visual memories are gone.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Visual memories?

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
All your memories.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
All right, so like

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
I can't remember a lot of things

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
visually, so it

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
parts from me to draw, I used to draw.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Kevin Eastman, who is the creator of the Ninja Turtles.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Yeah. And he said,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
well, I want to draw something with you.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
So when you draw something and then I'll

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
ink it and

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I said, well, that would be a dream come true.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
And he goes, well, let's do it and make it a exclusive

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
thing. So it's a

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
very limited number of print.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Oh, cool.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
That I drew the girl

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
and he inked it and did the rest.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
So we just made 200 of these

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
and I wanted to give everyone here.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Okay, great.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
That's amazing.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
All right, we'll seek hands those out,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
lady. Do you want to follow that?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Yeah. I survived

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
double cancer.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
What if she did

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
ratchet it up

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
and painted herself into this corner?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
What was your

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
What was your name?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Samantha.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Here, take the mic and tell us

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
what you brought for everybody.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
So I just made

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
keychains with everybody's

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
D&D character names.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
And I made special ones

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
for Spencer and Kumail.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Does it just say God on

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Spencer's?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
So I made about like 70,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
so I'm not sure if there's enough for everybody,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
but I made special ones for you guys.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Oh, thank you.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Thank you, Samantha, for the personalized

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
D&D keychains.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
After the show, also,

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
one of you here,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
we're raising a barn.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
What if we just became

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
a weird insular community?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Somebody brought a bushel of corn

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
and we just all helped each other.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Thank you.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Mine says Quark.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Thank you.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
You dropped one.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
If we were good people, we would have a food drive once in a while.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Did you get one? I do. I have Quark.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Yeah, that would be something

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
we could do. Speaking of charity,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
as long as we're in this warm, glowing portion,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Roy, you were telling me about

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
a charity that you support over drinks.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
You don't just support it over drinks,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
but...

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
It's easier, too.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
There's a charity starting

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
called After School All-Stars.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
And I'm part of

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
the Dallas chapter.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
And what this organization does

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
is it takes

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
at-risk kids

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
from three to six. You get some drunk?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Yeah.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
That's why they're at risk.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Yeah.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
That's why. I just pulled

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
apart. Dan, you're like the incredible

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Hulk. Like, I can't love

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
these

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
hands.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Dan managed to destroy one of the keychains,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
and now there's these

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
hand-made keychains. I just destroyed mine

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
in front of Samantha.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Oh, you got one. Great.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Okay. That one I'm going to put in my pocket and put in my...

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I'm sorry about that.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
That is awful.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
All right.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Sorry, Roy. The charity...

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Well, so anyway, they don't get drunk.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
What they do is they

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
help channel the kids into

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
whatever programs they have an interest in,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
and they specify in the arts

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
in drama,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
painting, acting,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
music, because there's not enough of that

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
in the schools now, especially 7th, 8th,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
9th grade kids. So they

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
create programs for these kids to do after school,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
so they're not out just roaming the street

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
and getting in trouble,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
breaking the law, that kind of thing. And they also do

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
some sports programs also for them.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
What's it called again? It's called After School All Stars.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Cool. So you can pull it up online. It's a really

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
nice charity. You can

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
donate to it. You can also...

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
They look for mentors. So they look for people

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
who are interested in just

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
hanging out with these kids and

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
pushing them in the right direction,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
rather than getting in trouble all the time.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
So it's a nice charity.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
And also, like our country being a capitalist

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
nation, that

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
is supposed to be an innovative,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
like, industrial

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
nation. We're supposed to come up with

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
ideas and create things

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
which justifies our

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
kind of hegemony and

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
where we have been

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
as we have been entering the

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
global economy, have been scaling

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
back on

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
our educational programs. And the first

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
corners that we've been cutting are the

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
corners that send kids into

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
spheres where they become

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
creative. Right. The whole creativity

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
thing is gone now. They don't

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
have art programs. They don't have music programs.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
If you see somebody

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
that, you know, that

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
7th grader who picks up a trumpet

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
and decides to start playing it, there's

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
nobody to sit there. Right. He goes to school and

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
goes, I found this weird thing I blew into.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
It made a noise and the teacher's like, yeah,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
are you going to be a mechanic or a math teacher?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Yeah, right.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I feel so

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
sad.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
No, it's good.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
We're helping. You

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
have money to help the kids.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
No, it's great. It's great. It's all very sad.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Well, there's also like

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
avian flu and Yellowstone parks going to turn

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
into a super volcano. Like any

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
minute now your heart could stop.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
You can't draw anymore.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
That's so awful.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Yeah. Well, welcome to

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Harmont. Well, they can draw.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
They teach kids to draw. It's good.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
They'll all be painters.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I was going to

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
say one real quick thing for real

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
superpower. Mine would be

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I'm just trying to make it happy again.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
You didn't have one?

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Well, I would, my genuine real one

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
would be time travel. I would do that

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
just because I've eaten a lot of shitty pizza,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
you know. They're just like, hey,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
don't eat it. It's not

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
great. That's deep. That's very deep.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Dude, you've had shitty pizza. It's no

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
good. Knowing you already got

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
all the calories of a

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
good pizza, but it tastes, listen, we could

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
talk about this. I was going to say,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I went to Chicago and asked

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
everybody I met in Chicago, people that worked

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
in restaurants and bars and people that were locals.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
I polled everybody. What's the best pizza

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
in town? I went to a place. It was the shittiest

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
slice of pizza I've ever had in my life. What was it called?

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I don't remember. But it was like one

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
of the biggies and it was garbage.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I'm full of shit pizza right now.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
I could have gone back in time.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Camille, tell everyone about your charity slice of life.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
It's about people

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
who've had shitty pizza.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Yeah, it's really great.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
And they're a Nike fuel band now.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
They have to run so much more

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
and keep up with it. So this doesn't

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
take money away from them

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
so they can't eat and then they

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
lose that weight. I was actually thinking for a second

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
like, oh, that would be a good Monday

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
super par. The idea to throw a switch

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
where you could just eat whatever you wanted

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
and your body wouldn't process it. And I was like, oh, bulimia?

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Yeah.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
You can have that power.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
The power of condor

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
feather.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
But we were saying like, you know how everyone says

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
go back, kill Hitler. I was talking

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
to my friends Tom Lennon and Matt Meyer who were like very funny

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
and I'm not name-dropping, I just want to give them credit.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
You're not name-dropping if the name is Matt Myra.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Yeah.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Okay.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I thought Tom Lennon was doing the heavy

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
lifting of that name drop.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Did you add Myra

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
for ballast?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Well, I'm just kidding.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
We were saying it would be much more

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
productive if you went back

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
to with like

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
a bunch of Steven Spielberg movies to show

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Hitler and be like, hey look, they're not

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
they're pretty good, right?

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Yeah.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
But don't show him Schindler's list

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
because he's like, oh, this is what Oscar's doing

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
and then

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
like you mean he'd be like, oh

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
oh, he's like, oh, this is what this guy's been doing

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
that I've been trusting. He's got a list.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Oh god, oh god, he would use it

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
to kill Schindler. Yeah, he would kill Schindler.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Or at least take his list.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
How about go back a little further?

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
A little further before he met Oscar?

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I don't know.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Well, you don't want to kill like 28-year-old

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Hitler. No, I don't want to kill him.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Like it would be weird, like he'd be like

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
hanging out at a coffee shop

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
and like playing Yahtzee

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
and you come up and you're just garroting him

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
and it's like, oh, Nazi.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Where would Hitler's favorite childhood memory

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
smell like?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
His dad's booze soaked breath as he

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
dragged him home from the Austrian bars.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Or also don't...

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Oh yeah, I read Mein Kampf.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
It's hard out there for a Hitler.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Headline?

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Dan Harmon says...

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Michael Ozziello.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Dan Harmon, soft on Hitler.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Hitler's not so bad.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Dan Harmon.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Harmon says he'd like to picnic with Stalin.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
After Harmon did a cosmetic

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
gesture of bringing up

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
the aneurysm guy, he proceeded

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
into the meat of his lecture.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
And he called him the aneurysm guy.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Also, total

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
teleportation.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Right?

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Like between the two things.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Just thinking about that discussion.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Obviously, teleportation.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Oh, would you do...

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Will you okay if I can't come anymore if I can teleport?

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Well, I was going to say this.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Aaron is not with you because of your dick.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Like...

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I don't mean that in a bad way.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
You can have the best dick in the world, I have no idea.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Honey, honey, take a vacation.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
But guys, you should read his dick.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I mean, it is.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
The wording, it's beautiful.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
It's very concise.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
It's like a dick digest.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
It's very well edited.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
My dick is a haiku.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
But may I just really quick ask you

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
about this fleet of

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
virile gentlemen

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
who are going to fuck me?

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
And can I also ask you what you think

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
my sexuality is?

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Because it's certainly not

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
just having someone

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
hammer my pussy.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I think you would have a say

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
in the matter.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
He doesn't have a team of guys.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I'd be like, baby, pick a continent.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I'm going to round you up.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Hi, I'm Aaron.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
My boyfriend made an arrangement.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
You want to go equatorial tonight?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I'll be right back.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
You want something spicy tonight?

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Serpent turf?

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Serpent turf.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I don't know what that means, but I like it.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
It means Omar Sharif

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
and Tony Hawk.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Serpent turf.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I like that.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
You want to stay for Italian

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
tonight?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
I would have you scour the earth

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
for men with your same brain

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
and heart.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
But who chose sex

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
instead of teleportation?

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I would choose teleportation

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
over sex. I love having sex.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
But you know what I love more?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Being able to go anywhere

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
in the snap of a

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
two fingers.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
But also, if you

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
are giving up sex, it's not like

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
your drive is also dead, right?

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I mean, you probably still have it.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
That would be a good concept.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I mean, sex is great, but past the age of 20,

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
it's not like this magical diamond

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
that you search for at the end of a cave.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I've had a ton of sex. I don't give a shit.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
No, if you couldn't have sex,

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
if you still had the sexual drive

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
and you never had sex,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
imagine when I was 12 to

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
21. I mean, I think about it all the time.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I don't want to go back to that

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
where all I wanted to do was have sex

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
and the one thing I couldn't do was have sex.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
But you magically go anywhere

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
that's what teleportation is, right?

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Who are you impressing with?

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I didn't think the drive would be there.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
But also, you

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
can go anywhere.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
It just takes a little longer. You could get on a plane.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
There's places you could go to.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
That's not true. You can't

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
just travel to

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Queen Elizabeth's

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
bathroom.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I can't say I would like to book a trip.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
But teleportation means that you can go

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
anywhere, right?

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
I also love that you guys

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
could go anywhere in the first place you talked about

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
was ground zero.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Well, you could go to ground zero.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Well, we were not today.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
We're going to put a flower there.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
We were talking about

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
if it happened

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
while it was happening, if we had that power

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
if another 9-11 happened.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
You'd save like 200 people.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
But you're calling Blinkly.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
You're like, oh, I can barely do anything.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
They're professionals trying here.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
But the crazy thing is you'd go nuts because you'd go,

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
okay, 9-11, which is like the Mick Jagger

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
of global

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
events.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
That's going to be a variety for sure.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
And then you'd go like,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
what about the pixies of constant starvation

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
and global world?

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
The class system's like, I can't use

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
my teleportation. I can try

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
to feed people.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
You'd be like Santa Claus.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
You would just have a big

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
sack of food.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
It's not like

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
there would ever be a point where you could take a break.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Every time you did, you'd

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
know the faces of the people

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
that you let go hungry.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
So you're saying if you had teleportation

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
you would just travel giving food to people

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
who don't have access to food?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I think you would fall into that because otherwise

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
you couldn't even enjoy. What are you going to do?

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Teleport to the tip of the pyramid, like some jagoff

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
and go like, woo!

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
While you know that in Africa

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
there's people, you could just bring them

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
antibiotics.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Erin, where would you go if you could teleport?

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Where would you pop off to, like first off?

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Not the most important, but what were some

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
places you would like to be?

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Okay.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
So if there's

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
a super Parisian couple

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
that was really

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Parisian people

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
are really curious to me.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I'd like to go into a couple's apart. Are you invisible?

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
You can do Airbnb.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
You're not invisible. You're a person.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Okay, that's fine.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
You want to just watch people fucking Paris?

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
No! You can have that arranged very easily.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Well, yes, but not like first.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Wait, wait.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Tell me more about Parisian people.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
The first place I would go, well,

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
this is a very boring answer.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I've always wanted to go to India.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I would go to India.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Kumail's home, India.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I would want to see Kumail's parents.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Why don't you use your superpower to get it too?

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I'd like to see

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Kumail's magic carpet in India.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
And

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
you can give you a tour of the set

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
of Outsourced.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Shot on location.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
They shot there, didn't they? Did they shoot in India?

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
They did shoot there.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Do you know?

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Oh, I don't want to talk about that show.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Do we know that you were asked to audition

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
for that show? I'm just guessing.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
We can assume.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Yes, I was.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I would just want to go anywhere.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I mean, first, I would probably want to go

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
from Los Feliz to Beverly Hills in a second

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
instead of five hours.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
This is better than...

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I also would very much miss having sex.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
I like having sex. I definitely want to have children.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Enjoy having sex with Dan.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
We have great, wonderful,

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
fulfilling, emotional,

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
romantic

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
sex that is meaningful

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
and great...

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Sorry.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
And four times!

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Technical difficulties. Technical difficulties.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Stick with us, you guys.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Disney!

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
All right. Spencer, Spencer,

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
where would you teleport to?

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
What? Or a superpower choice?

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
I'd teleport to a place where people

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
take these games. Oh, sorry.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
It only worked that way. It was overlapped.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
It wouldn't have worked in the other way.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
What's up, you guys?

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
By the way, I didn't know that

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
two weeks ago, your dad played

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
my character.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
I'm so honored

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
and I'm not even doing a bit.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
In my head, your dad looks exactly

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
like Gandalf.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Yeah.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
The white. The white.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
So he's even above the gray.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
I'm very excited.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I never met your dad.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
What is your definition of honor?

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Is your dad awesome?

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
No.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
That only makes you a bigger

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
conundrum to me.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
They're still going through some stuff.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Yeah, life is going

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
through some stuff, you know?

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
That's right.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Did that show bring you guys any closer,

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
or did it push you farther apart, or did it

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
change anything? I don't really know.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
It never, it didn't

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
affect anything.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
I missed that.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
I don't know what the history is.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Nothing happened.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
It's all stagnant.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Let's make something happen, Spencer.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I want you to give us the character sheets,

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
and I want you to introduce

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
D&D tonight to the

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
sweet, mellifluous,

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
honey-flowing notes of Michael LinkedIn's

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Smooth Jazz.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Here's the track name.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
I've already played Heat. That's when you've been hearing.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
So stay with me.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Everything must change.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
That doesn't sound romantic.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Everyone is called When I Hold You.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
What do you guys want to do?

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
When I hold you?

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Okay.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Are any of these lyricized?

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
No, that's all instrumentals.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Alright.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Can you give it your smooth jazziest best?

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
I can give it my most

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
embarrassingly honest attempt.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
That's all we ever ask from you, Spencer.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Alright, shall we?

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Spencer Crittenden and everybody.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Thank you.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Start.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Last time on Harmontown,

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
our heroes

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
having been whisked through a tree

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
by means of rooty wood growth,

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
the third, were brought

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
to Mango Butzolot's yellow camp

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
home of the Butzolot's Barbarians.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
The group

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
was horrified to discover demons

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
infesting the encampment.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Leaping into action,

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Christopher stabbed a demonic taskmaster,

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
and Sharpie

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
blasted him with fire.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Mulraine and Quark had a brief

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
aside before attacking

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
the demon.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Daggers, swords,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
knives flew and the demon

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
was slain.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
The heroes broke out of the bonds

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
of two chained barbarians,

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
who were short-lived.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Boozing out of a massive pit,

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
came

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
several slimy lemurs

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
that Sharpie

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
entangled the wriggling

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
mass

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
with his spring-powered

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
vines.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
The lemurs were trapped

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
for now.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
But will our heroes be able

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
to use their borrowed time

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
wisely and bring back

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
the barbarian badass

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
before the brief bramble barricade

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
is breached by the blobby

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
brutish lemurs?

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Eliteration.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Is sensual.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Sibilance.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
We'll find out next

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:12.000
on Harmon Time.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
I'm really feeling this.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
This is some great tunes.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Sorry to cut off your praise.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
That was awesome, man. Thank you so much.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
I didn't hear a single thing you said because of my giant

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
throbbing erection right now.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
You're just beating in your ears.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Jeff!

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
I could pet glass right now.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
All right.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
So I'm wounded right now?

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I take it no one listened to me.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
I didn't hear a thing you said.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Jeff, last week you and I

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
made a pact.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
But I don't think Jeff was...

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Oh, you were Jeff.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I was playing Jeff. You were playing Quark.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I was playing you.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
A day I made the decision to have Adam Goldberg

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
play me.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
The role he was born to play.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
He, you, didn't agree to the pact

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
if I remember correctly.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
No, we did.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
He thought better of it in his mind,

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
but outwardly he accepted.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
What you might be thinking of is that the point of the bit

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
was that Jeff would never agree to it,

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
so it seems weird.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
But he did.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
What was the pact?

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
You and I are making an alliance and we're best friends

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
and we got each other's backs forever.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
We love each other and everything's great.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I, uh,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
you remind me of that right now

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
and I hold out my amulet of winter

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
and I go,

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
sounds cool to me.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And I hold out my amulet of summer

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
and I say,

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
uh, hot it up.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Ooh.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Boo.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Those are demons booing you.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
I mean, you're right, that wasn't funny and didn't make sense.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
The boo is really...

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
But the answer is yes, the pact is agreed upon.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Alliance?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Well, and I say, let me melt your assholeness

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
with my amulet of summer.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
And I say, go fuck off, you shit.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Well, that's the end of that alliance.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
No, no, no.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I just said it was cool with me and you called me names.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Oh, well, I apologize.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
I thought you were fighting it off. I'm a little defensive.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
No, no, I was saying, I was saying it sounds cool to me.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Hey guys, we're supposed to fight demons.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Can we figure out this fact once we...

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Were you saying it's cool?

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
I'm saying it's cool with me.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
I'm sorry, everybody.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Did I tell you about my sweet, sensual sex with Dan Harriman?

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Dan Harriman.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Dan Harriman.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
You guys all saw that.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
I said it was cool and she called me an asshole.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
You're right, you're right, you're right.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
I thought when you said...

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
This pact is on probation already.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Probationary pact.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
To the east, a large pit

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
out of which slithered

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
those seven lemurs,

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
those ones that got entangled in Sharpie's vines.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
To the west,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
the two freed barbarian allies

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
are freeing more trapped barbarians.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
You see one

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
semi-familiar.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
You think you might have saw him last on the plane of Twyla.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
He's a half-orc gentleman with gleaming armor

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
and a broad axe.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
He's one of those slaves?

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
He was one of those slaves.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Or he was chained up as if he were one of those slaves.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Oh, okay.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
But his bonds being freed,

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
he trots up towards you.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
So where did we land on the pact?

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Are you guys...

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
I said cool, she called me an asshole.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
I'm kind of on the facts right now.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Half-orc gentleman.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
I remember you.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
often own up to the fact

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
that I'm an alcoholic

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
and have frequent blackouts.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Could you remind me of where we met?

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Go for it.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
As do I.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I don't remember either.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
We must have met somewhere.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
It's Roy.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Yeah.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Here's the character.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
What's Roy's name?

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
What's your name?

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Slab Squat Thrust.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Slab Squat Thrust.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Hey, that's Slab Squat Thrust.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Oh, Squat Thrust.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Hey, what's up?

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Remember when we freed you

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
from your bonds like 30 seconds ago?

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
That was you?

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
That was us.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Wait a minute, you're Kristen Berg.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I've heard of you.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Yeah, you like that song?

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Lady in Red?

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
The one song, yeah, it's amazing.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
It's a great song.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Did you write anything else?

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Yep.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
You heard Woman in Green?

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Bitch in Yellow

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
was a real bad point.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
I was in the 90s, I was in your gangster period.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I was trying to be relevant.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Sorry, is the first name Slab

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
or Slab Squat?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Slab Squat.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Okay, last name Thrust.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Have you been since we've seen you last, SST?

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
What, 30 seconds ago?

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
I'm okay.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
We are getting attacked by these bad guys.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Yeah, but we got to reacquaint each other

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
before we do anything, right?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
I heard about a pack that was going on.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
I make a pack with Slab Squat Thrust.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
So I don't have a packed person?

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
You can join our pack.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
We want to do a three-way pack.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Let's you and I do a packed

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
and then he'll stand in between

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
and our pack to rub up against each other.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
But just the tip.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
What do you think packed means?

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Yeah, let's do it.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
And while they're doing that, I go up to Quark

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
and I'm like, hey, sorry, that's a really great item.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Yeah, I was jazz-dicking.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Yeah, whatever.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Whatever, it's cool. We're good.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Oh, God, that was a good pack.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Yeah.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
I could have used some music, but...

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Hey, why are you guys so wet?

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Don't worry about it.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Yeah, we're...

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
After-packed.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Um...

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
All right, let's attack.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Let's attack some demons.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
After-packed.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
So, yeah,

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
you know, you tangled up those demons and vines.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Yeah.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Those are the closest demons,

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
but on the north, you see a tall demon.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
He's gray-skinned

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
and skinny-styled.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
And he's got a scraggly beard

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
made out of tentacles, and he's wielding a fiery whip.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
He's about 300 feet off,

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
but he sees you over there,

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
and he's coming towards you.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Is he a mind flayer?

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
He's not.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
I asked that before.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
What do you want skinny-style?

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Like a hipster, jeans?

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Yeah, well, he's nude,

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
like a hipster.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
But like a demon.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
He's holding a giant cup of coffee

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
and has headphones around his neck.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Uh...

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
All right, I...

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
I engage him

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
ocularly,

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
meaning I make eye contact.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Okay.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
And I hold up a finger,

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
like kind of a...

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
just kind of a badass, like, don't...

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Like a not-today kind of eyes?

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Yeah, like, don't just don't.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Like a Jeremy Renner kind of...

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Don't.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Just don't.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
He does.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
He does.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Well, I told him not to.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
As he continues his approach,

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
he throws down his whip,

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
and he flexes his flexible fingers,

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
and you can see blue and red flames

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
dancing about his hands,

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
breathing his arms, and flaming and flames.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
I throw down whatever I'm holding,

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
and I...

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
And I use shocking grasp.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
I wreathe my arms in electricity.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
You're about 150 feet off.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Yeah.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Okay, can I try the don't thing

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
against this guy?

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
He don't!

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Maybe he didn't hear.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Maybe you weren't loud enough.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Don't!

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
He does.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I mean, he said there's a

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
non-conflict resolution for this.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Sometimes maybe it's saying don't.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
What if all five of us did at the same time?

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Everybody?

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Yeah.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
One, two, three, don't.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Yeah.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Wait, don't on three?

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
No, one, two, three, don't.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Don't is four.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
One, two, three, don't!

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Don't!

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
He does.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Goddamn it!

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
This guy's...

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
At the very least, he's confused, right?

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Okay.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Can he roll his eyes at least?

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
No.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Let's try one more thing together.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Okay.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
One, two, three, one, two, three, don't.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
That ball chain pivot.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
And then can we say you look...

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Two steps, kick turn, kick turn.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Kick turn, don't.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Okay.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Five, can we recap that real quick?

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
I'm sorry.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Guys, we opened in two nights.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Guys, I'm sorry.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Sharpie, what if we say

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
you look great or something?

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Keep on, keep it up.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Alright, well, I say don't

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
change

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
what you're doing with your hair.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
It's working.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Right.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
We should each get a different compliment, so I'll be like

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
that's working.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
And we all compliment a different aspect of him.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
I talked to a nearby animal.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Are there any animals nearby?

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
No, no.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
I was going to have like a wolf go...

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
That's great.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
I'm a woman.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Yeah, so it'll mean more.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
What?

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
It'll mean more, your compliment will mean more.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
I'll do that wolf whistle

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
and I'll cover my breasts

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
as if I'm afraid they're going to explode from a rousal.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Which is what happens

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
every time a woman gets aroused.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Is that they swell up to the point of explosion.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Which is why you chose teleportation.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Let's do it.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Alright, alright.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
So it's 5, 6, 5...

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
5, 6, 7, 8, right?

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8,

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
kickball change,

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
kickball change,

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
kick...

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
It's really working.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Yeah.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Yeah.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Is that him?

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
No, no, he's like...

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
And I lay on the ground and they give thumbs up

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
and like a wink.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
But I also make it clear

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
that I don't want him to do anything.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
But I'm just like,

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
you're doing it, you're doing it.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Spencer, I noticed that my

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
strength and constitution are lower right now.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
What happened last week?

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
I don't know.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
They just haven't been changed.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
You guys had stat modifier

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
penalties from losing your shadows.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
I might not have changed those.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Alright, so...

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
He's 150 feet away from us right now.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
He's closer now.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
What's the battlefield

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
that we're on look like?

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
You're in the middle of this area.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
There's a pit near you.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
It's kind of blocking it off and there's those slimy devils.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Yeah, yeah, then there's

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Roy and he came from kind of the north

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
area.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
I said we send Roy in first.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
A slap squad, remember when we let you free?

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Right.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
This is your big chance to

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
do all that Egyptian anxiety

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
from that show.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
You want fame, Roy? I mean, slap squad? Well, fame costs.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Right now is where you start paying.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
In sweat.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Roy, I'm going to give you my feather necklace

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
just so you look cuter.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Thank you, I appreciate that's nice.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
We tried don't, right?

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Yeah, we tried don't.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
We tried complimenting him, we did a dance routine.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Right, okay.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Spencer, am I close enough

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
to actually do anything to this thing?

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
You could...

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Searing light is the only thing you'd hit him with.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
The rest you'd have to be pretty close.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Alright, well let's hit him with searing light.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Okay,

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
praying to your gods.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
You see a light open up in the heavens

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
and a shaft of white light

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
pierces down from the sky

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
and blasts directly into

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
the devil's face.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Wow.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
He's the devil?

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
He's a devil.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Okay, cool.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
I wish we'd known that before we tried

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
all these other weird tactics.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
We thought he was Bob Fosse.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I thought he was like World Dollars BFT.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Yeah.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
I was literally picturing Michael McDonald

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
walking everybody like, hey, how's it going?

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
What's up?

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
I definitely said demon.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
But when I said devil,

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
you guys clued in and I was like, oh, devil,

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
not demon, that's just a normal human.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Okay, anyway,

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
it does 16 damage.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Whoa!

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Whoa!

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Can you have a catchphrase?

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Like, you've been thrust!

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Isn't that your name?

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Yeah, but I'm not going to use that as a

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
almost like a come on.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
All right, well, you don't have to use it.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I'm sorry.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Write another song.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
You've been thrust!

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Can I have it?

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Yeah, sure.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Who's next, Spencer?

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
It would be Kumail's next.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
So if I become invisible,

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
can I be invisible and then also step?

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
You could do both,

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
but you're too far away to

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
get over to him right now.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Okay, well, so I do have a poison dagger.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Yep.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Shoot that poison dagger!

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Or the shortbow.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
How about this?

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
I

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
tie a rope to the poison dagger

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
and I throw it.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
God damn it.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Can we have an intervention?

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Well, then I can pull it back.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
I know why you do it.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
I feel like it's my signature move

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
at this point.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Ever worked.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Not yet.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Can you imagine a rope and a dagger

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
and tying the rope to the dagger?

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
It's not like an Atari game.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
No, it looks like Scorpion from Mortal Kombat

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
to get over here.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
It's cool!

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Get over here!

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
I think it's cool.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Instead of, I say,

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
human thrust!

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
All right,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
I just throw the knife at him.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Yeah, yeah. You threw the knife.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Wait, was it roped or not roped?

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Which is better.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Keep the rope on it, man.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Tell him, Spencer.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
A rope would make a knife less accurate,

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
but you would be able to reel it in.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
How much less accurate?

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Like minus two.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Oh, that's worth the fuck it.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Minus two?

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Yeah, I tie the rope.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Woo!

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Human thrust!

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
All right, well, yeah, yeah.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
You tie and throw the dagger

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
and you strike the demon in the temple.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Oh.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
And he's Jewish?

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Hello!

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Okay.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Dealing two damage.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Two damage, but it's a poison dagger,

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
so it'll slowly work its way.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Devils are immune to poison.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
My dad ran into that same problem.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Oh, really?

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
If I dip it in, like, vitamin C,

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
would that have hurt him?

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
No.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Okay.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
All right, who's next?

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Kumail Dan.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Yeah, we're just going this way.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
All right, well, can I

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
reach this guy with shocking grasp?

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
No, you'd have to not

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
be able to.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
You have to.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
All right, well, then I...

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Why don't we approach him?

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Let's close the distance.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
All right, fine, I'm marching towards him

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
and I got my arms crackling with ferocious

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
electric energy and I'm like,

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
I said, don't!

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
But you did!

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Now I'm gonna...

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
someone's goods to get got.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
I'm turning a glass of champagne

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
behind him as his hype man.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Yeah, that happens.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Putting it at Mulraine's turn.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Okay.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
I put four of my arrows

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
and I weave them into my rope to make a necklace.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
See what you do?

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
She's made a rope necklace.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
A necklace of a rope.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I made a necklace that I know will fit

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
the devil's neck and I put

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
arrows in it in a way that are like

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
spikes on the necklace.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Like a collar.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Like a collar, but bigger than a collar.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
And as everyone knows,

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
I make great rope necklaces.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
So I run up

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
to where Sharpie is

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
and I say, oh my god, I found her necklace.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Assuming that he'll be like,

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
oh my necklace and put it on.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
To Sharpie?

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
No, no, no.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
To the devil.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Yeah, you're still too far off,

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
but you could get that prepped

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
for when he's actually nearby.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
But you know, he doesn't know

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
who you are.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
No, I know, but if a stranger came up

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
to me and they're like, oh my god,

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
you dropped your phone, I'd be like,

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
I've never seen before in your life

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
in your natural history.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
And it looked like a spiky murder necklace?

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
No, no, no.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
He doesn't see the spikes.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
They're woven in.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
The idea is that he'll tie it

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
on his neck and it will prick his neck

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
and he'll bleed out.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I'm on board.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
And I'll be the victor.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
You made a pact with this?

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Yeah, I made a pact.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
So I run up and I go, look, this sounds

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
like it, but I'm with you all the way,

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
if I can help you in any way

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
with this necklace gambit, I'm there.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Okay, you absolutely can.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
I'll make it and I'm going to give it to you

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
so you can deliver it.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
I'm with you.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
So I just make it and I give it

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
to my friend Quirk.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
So you could also travel up

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
his body and put it around his neck.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
I made a pact.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
You tell me what to do and it's done.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I really like the, oh, you lost this.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I don't have to say it confidently.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
I'll give it, do it in whatever method you want.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
You think it's better coming from a barbarian

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
gnome than a woman?

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I mean,

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
I mean, you're a nice looking gnome.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Well, thank you.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Thank you. It's very nice of you to say.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
So I got the necklace.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Well, if a woman did it and they had the right

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
music.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
I'm going to go up to him.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
I'm a barbarian and I fly off

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
in a barbarian range.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
And I run up to the demon and I go,

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
ooh, ooh, ooh, excuse me,

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
gentlemen.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
How do you do?

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
It seems to me that you might have dropped something.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Is there a necklace about your size?

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Is this your necklace?

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Ignore the spikes.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
I mean, I thank you so much.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
I look back tomorrow and I go,

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
how am I doing?

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
I just thank you.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
We made a pact.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Thank you so much. I love it.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
No, no, no.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Spencer.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Yeah, he shoots two fireballs,

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
one of which hits Quark.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Spencer.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
How much did it do?

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
How much damage did it do?

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Six damage to Quark.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Wait, we don't know.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Did the devil fall for it?

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Nine damage to Roy.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Oh, why, man?

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
How would I get involved in this?

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
He doesn't speak common.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
What sort of damage did I sustain?

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
You took six.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
To the face.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Fire to the face.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I turn back to Mulraine

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
with my face on fire.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Your eyebrows are gone.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
My eyebrows are gone.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
And I look back

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
and I take some of the soot

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
off of my hair and I draw

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
happy eyebrows on my forehead.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
And I go,

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
it was worth it!

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Oh, boy.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
I'm too busy making another necklace to notice.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Wow.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
This is a great pact.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
No, no.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
And then I look up and I feel very bad.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Spencer.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Wait, wait, wait.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Do stuff by saying his name like that.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
I'm not trying to make him do anything.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
He's writing the story.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
He wrote the story.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
No, no, no. We don't break the fourth wall.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
We're in it.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
There's no story. That's just what's happening.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
You think because you made him a lasagna

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
that he's going to roll higher numbers for you?

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
I didn't know you were talking about that.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Did she bribe you with lasagna?

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
No, she just gives me food.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
She's a feeder.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
And it's delicious.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
She's a feeder!

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
She makes people food!

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Do you expect that?

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
She's a feeder!

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Aaron, do you expect higher rolls from Spencer

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
when you ply him with treats?

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
No, no, no, I don't.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
I think I...

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Let's take this from a real-world perspective.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
No, I don't have a baby.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
In Incarnation...

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
In Incarnation of the Demon

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
appears in front of you, Erin McGathy.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
This is not of this world.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
You've never seen anything like it.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
It's skin is crackling and ashen.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
There's molten lava in its eyes.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
And you offer it

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
a rope tied in a knot.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Would it be, oh, thank you,

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
or would it be I'm a demon

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
here to slay the souls of the living?

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I'm going to keep doing that,

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
regardless of strings or knots

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
or necklaces.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
I mean, here's a real question.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Do demons just have

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
no insecurity?

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Like, they don't.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
I mean, I really...

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
They're not accessorized?

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
No, they're tortured.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
They're tortured creatures.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
My face is on fire.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
No, they'd be all like,

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
I came to this plane to murder people.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
I enslaved all the people

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
that look like this person.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
I apologize. I just assumed

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
that every creature had some sort of

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
soft spot.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Demon!

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
What does that mean to any of you?

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Demon!

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
You know what demons are?

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Yeah.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
I went in there with the necklace

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
to prove a point

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
about pats and about demons.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Yeah, you guys

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
are all playing your characters very accurately.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
I run back to Mulrainee

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
if it's still my turn. Do I have a turn to do this or no?

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Yeah, it's your turn again. He threw the fireball.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Okay, I run back to Mulrainee

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
to go, your turn, and I...

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Wait, but it's his turn.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Okay, well, you're next.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
I'm gonna make you a little friendship bracelet

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
for him, and then I will...

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
At the very least, the demon

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
is gonna remember this

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
battle.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
When he's in the demon lounge,

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
you're not gonna believe who I killed today.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Can we backtrack?

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
I know I made him a necklace, but can we remember

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
the time when someone initiated a tap dance

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
for the demon?

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
It wasn't a tap dance. We were 150 feet away

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
by the time, and it seems like...

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Imagine the work, neither.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
I'm kidding about that.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
I run back and I go, it didn't work.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Oh, my God, that was a shitty idea.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
I'm sorry, did I do it wrong?

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Aww.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
How's that pack working out for you?

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
The what? The pack. How's it working out?

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
So far, it stinks.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Okay, we have a pretty good pack here.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
I stab Roy in the chest.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
What the fuck?

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
And I dagger over and over again.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
I stab him in the chest

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
because I'm thirsty for blood.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Wow. Okay.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Well, we have an opening in the pack.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Yeah, we do. We don't have necklaces

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
or arrows or anything like that.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
And we don't get our faces burned off.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
You know what? No more packs for me. I'm going slow.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Well, I tell you what, you join us and I can cure

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
that face wound of yours.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Let's find out how you've been stabbing the chest works out.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
I stab him in the face.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
It takes eight damage to the face.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Oh, is that what we're doing?

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Yeah.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
This is a great...

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
It's a blood that comes from his face

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
because I take the blood and I paint

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
a picture of his family dying

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
on my horse.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
This is a great story

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
for the demon. Yeah, it was.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
These people

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
are easily slaughtered today.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
We'll wait till you hear about this.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Mulraine, why are you

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
tacking slap squat?

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
I don't know. I have a feeling.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
What is your feeling? Your feeling is what?

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
I don't know. It's negative.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
I want to drink his blood and draw pictures with it.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Whatever, guys.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
We are having fun, right?

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Not slap squat.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Okay, so I'll ignore

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
the painful

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
evisceration of my face

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
and I will cure

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Quark's serious wounds.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Thank you, slap squat.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
You're welcome. Quark goes back

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
to full health.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Yeah.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Remember, one left.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Packed, one place. Okay, I'm in.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
You're packed. Okay.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Okay, well,

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
I

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
reeled a knife back in.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
This is

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
the payoff.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
That happens.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Is it still

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
attached to his head? Does he get closer to us?

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
No.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
I pointed it while it's being reeled back in.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
I'm a reaction

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
shot in a 1980s commercial

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
for the rope

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
tied to a knife.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Whoa!

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
It's pretty cool, right?

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
What's that?

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
I thought he threw that knife.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Now it's going back.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
I want my dagger back, dagger back.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Knife rope. Ropes all separately.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
It does not include knife.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
It does not include knife, all around.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
I take my short bow

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
and I

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
just fucking

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
shoot it at this guy.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
You miss.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Sorry.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
The knife rope was way better.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I should stick with my thing.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
This was like when Michael Jordan

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
tried to play baseball.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
I was

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
marching toward him.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
I'm telling you, with my arms

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
wreathed in crackling

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
electronic energy,

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
carrying shocking grasp,

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
thinking about all of my father's

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
abuse of me.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
I was just

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
locking eyes with him and just going,

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
I told you don't!

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Now

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
you will be

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
grasped!

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Shocking.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
I think your catchphrase needs a little

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
bit of work.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
I'm starting to like that thrust catchphrase.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Dealing

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
19 damage.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
The electricity

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
pulses through his body and he shakes

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
violently and you see his eyes

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
pop and ooze and liquefy out of his

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
face. He falls to the ground

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
and dissipates

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
into a black fog that

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
drifts away.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Oh!

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
We did it!

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
That's harm attack everybody!

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Thank you for coming!

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Good job Roy!

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
You did great this time!

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Roy McClureg everybody!

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
I'll say again,

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
McGathey, Kumail Nanjiani,

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Spencer Crittenden and as always,

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
also Connor will see you next week

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
for the teleportation

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
versus sex.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Thank you, I seek Donnelly for the artwork

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
and Samantha for the lovely keychains.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
I'm Jeff Davis. One more time for Dan

01:51:36.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Mayer everybody!
