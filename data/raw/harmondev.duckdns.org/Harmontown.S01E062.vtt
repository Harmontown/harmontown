Let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:58.000\nA couple of lazy karate kicks I did there for you listening at home. Thank you for coming to Harmontown.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:07.000\nThank you, Jeff Davis, our Comptroller. What a wonderful job he does.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:10.000\nWell, I got nothing.

Fathalbap?\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:25.000\nHe's the best name you can thank.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:29.000\nHe's the worst name. I can never remember. There's no mnemonic device for Fathalbap.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:32.000\nYou can never remember if it's B first or M first.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:34.000\nYou can say Mo Fathelbab wrong and nobody knows.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:36.000\nOh, that's it. Okay. Fathalbap...\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:37.000\nI won't...\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:39.000\nFathalbap.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:42.000\nIt's going to be a bad show tonight, folks.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:45.000\nBuckle up and...\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:47.000\nMo came out of the car.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:54.000\nWe said it three times wrong, so he's like an insecure Beetlejuice.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:56.000\nFathalbap, Fathalbap, Fathalbap.\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:01.000\nAnd he's like, I think you might mean me.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:03.000\nLet me help you.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:05.000\nI've been doing this my whole life.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:11.000\nAnyways, yeah, I was nursing a well-earned hangover all day today.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:17.000\nWe watched like four movies in bed, Aaron and I, and Jeff.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:20.000\nBecause we did the Channel 101 roast last night.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:24.000\nIt was a ten-year anniversary of Channel 101.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:26.000\nSome of you may not be familiar with Channel 101,\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:28.000\nbut it's been around for ten years now.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:29.000\nIt's ten years old.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:33.000\nI gave birth to something ten years old.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:39.000\nYou gave birth to something zero years old, and now it's ten.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:42.000\nIt's going to be a bad show, folks.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:44.000\nIt's just people correcting each other.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:46.000\nDo your baby back rib-riff one more time.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:47.000\nOh, man.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:50.000\nI stopped short because I was like, what are you doing?\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:53.000\nI'm going to do, here, watch this.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:54.000\nWhat's your name, ma'am?\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:55.000\nSamantha.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:57.000\nGot Samantha?\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:59.000\nIt's like got milk.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:00.000\nThat's it.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:04.000\nThat's all you get tonight.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nSo just mid-90s advertising slogan.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:11.000\nYeah.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:13.000\nOh, dear heavens.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:15.000\nPull it together.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:17.000\nIt's partly your job, though, isn't it?\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:19.000\nMy favorite part of the roast last night,\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:21.000\nI mean, I can't imagine many people that are here\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:24.000\nwere there last night, but one guy.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:28.000\nAt some point, we were all roasting each other.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:31.000\nIt's friends roasting each other, so that's what a roast should be.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:35.000\nSo good-natured, fake vitriol and spleen.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:39.000\nAnd there was a gal in the audience who kept just going,\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:44.000\njust ejaculations for no reason in the middle of the show.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:46.000\nAnd Dan got up last.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:49.000\nI was the roast master and brought Dan up for the finale,\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:53.000\nand Dan stopped roasting friends and just lampooned.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:57.000\nNo, not lambasted.\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nAssaulted a woman in the audience.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:01.000\nAnd it was for the benefit of all.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:03.000\nIt was fantastic.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:06.000\nSo you missed that.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:08.000\nLet's do a new segment.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:10.000\nDo you have a song you can play a little sound by?\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:12.000\nWhat sort of segment?\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:15.000\nThis segment is called...\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:18.000\nAsk Dan a Question.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:34.000\nHello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Ask Dan a Question,\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:38.000\nwhere you, the audience, get to ask Dan Harmon a question.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nA question?\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nYeah.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nAll right.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.000\nGood, good.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:51.000\nWell, maybe, hey, if you got enjoyment out of that,\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nmaybe it won't be a bad show.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:56.000\nMaybe we accidentally assembled some people\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nwith very low standards tonight,\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:00.000\nand they're going even right out.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.000\nOr I picked the perfect musical cue.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:04.000\nNo, you did great.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:07.000\nAnybody have a question?\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nRaise your hand.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nDeeper first. What's your name, sir?\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:12.000\nI'm Kyle.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nKyle, what's your question?\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:16.000\nHow are you doing?\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:19.000\nThe question to Dan is from Kyle.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nHow are you doing?\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nI'm doing good.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nI was a little hungover.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:34.000\nWell, you asked a question.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:36.000\nI don't know yet.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:39.000\nAll right, one more question. One more time for one more question.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:44.000\nLet's go in the back. I see the shadow of a hand.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nWhere did you get your haircut? It looks great.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nThe question is, where did you get your haircut?\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:52.000\nAddendum, it looks great.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:59.000\nChicago.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:03.000\nNext question.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:06.000\nLet's go with a beef fungus bill.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nBeef fungus bill in the front row.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nIs there any conceivable way\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:11.000\nHeat Vision and Jack could come back?\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nThe question is to Dan Harmon,\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:14.000\nis there any conceivable way\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:23.000\nthat Heat Vision and Jack could come back?\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nThat was too fast. I'm sorry.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.000\nI mean, they've been trying to,\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nthat's been trying to happen\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nfor a really, really, really long time.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nI just watched it.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nWe screened it at the Austin Television Festival,\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nand I was stricken with the fact that,\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:40.000\nA, holy shit, we need to tighten those edits.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:44.000\nBut B, I think it really just needs to be a movie,\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nif anything. I don't know.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nBut then again, Schrab had a really good idea\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:50.000\nfor an animated series.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:53.000\nEvery time that thing comes up\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nand is going to get reborn in some way,\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:59.000\nsomething complicated happens.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:02.000\nThere's a lot of cooks in that kitchen,\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:06.000\na lot of people sharing that intellectual property.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:10.000\nUnder the right circumstances,\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nwould you want it to come back?\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:15.000\nWell, I think you could make a really, really good movie\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nout of it.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nI had a script that I wrote,\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nwhich I'm sure it's not the best script I've ever written,\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nbut the idea behind the script,\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:27.000\nI felt like going into doing a Heat Vision and Jack feature,\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:30.000\nHeat Vision and Jack kids is this thing I did in 1999\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nwith Schrab.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nRob Schrab for Fox.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nI was a pilot that didn't get picked up about Jack Black.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nHe's a super intelligent astronaut.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nHe's got too close to the sun, so his brain expanded.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nHe's running from NASA with his talking motorcycle voice point.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nOh, and Wilson.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:48.000\nAnd I always felt like if you did a movie version of it,\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:51.000\nthe movie version of it should be like...\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:54.000\nAnybody ever see Wrestler's Rhapsody?\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nYeah.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:59.000\nI wanted to have a kind of meta quality to it where,\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:03.000\nlike, the sort of knight-ridery, hulky,\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:09.000\nAthenian, Buck Rogers' kind of fantasy quality\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:14.000\nto the lifestyle that Jack and Heat Vision were caught in,\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nalong with its episodic nature,\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:20.000\nwas sort of a metaphor for the Bachelor lifestyle.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nThe four one settles down.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nYou've got your one buddy who's like,\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nare you ever going to let you settle down,\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\na.k.a. like a motorcycle that can't stand still\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nor he falls down himself?\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nI'm sitting right here, Dan.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nAnd then you've got...\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:41.000\nSo it's like, my version of the feature was going to be that Jack,\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:44.000\nlike, first you just do like 20 minutes of awesome,\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:47.000\njust like, just do Heat Vision and Jack,\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\njust do like an episode or two, just like wing through them,\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:55.000\nand then plot point one on page 20 is Jack,\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nonce again, for the 500th time,\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nor he's lost count, like, once again,\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:03.000\nhe goes into a small town and meets a nurse\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nor an aerobics instructor or something\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nand she's having trouble with us\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nthat indirectly leads to a supernatural adventure.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.000\nBut this time, like, he goes home with her\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:15.000\nand he's doing the same routine over and over again\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:18.000\nwith just cosmetic differences.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:23.000\nHis life is templated and successful, syndicated, if you will.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:28.000\nAnd then the woman's roommate comes home\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:31.000\nand it's a girl that Jack did this with,\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nlike, five seasons ago.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:36.000\nAnd she's like, holy shit.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nShe's completely changed.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nShe's going to medical school now.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nShe's become a real human being\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:44.000\nand this person that she knew had this dalliance with\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nwho came through her life.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:49.000\nHe hadn't changed at all.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:54.000\nAnd that was, like, Jack's seeing himself through her eyes\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:57.000\nas a creature of habit, as a person who wasn't,\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:01.000\nwhose life was going through these illogical patterns.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nFor instance, why are you running from NASA still?\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nHave you tried talking to them?\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:11.000\nYou know, why do you, when you find out that Bigfoot exists,\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nwhy don't you leverage that information\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:16.000\nto get people to stop chasing you?\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.000\nOr just, like, why do you bother fighting Bigfoot\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nwhen you're on the run from these people?\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:23.000\nCan't you use that as an excuse to...\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:26.000\nHe starts asking questions that you're not supposed to ask\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:31.000\nand that sort of triggers their greatest adventure yet.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nBut that's probably where it falls apart\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nand that's probably why it'll never get made.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nBut I would really like to see that.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nI could probably just do that and not call it heat vision of Jack.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nI could call it octopus face and sock dick.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:43.000\nOctopus face and sock dick.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nThey're best friends to the lovin'\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nand they're gonna go on some adventures\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:50.000\nand find some Bigfoots, too.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nThey're gonna do battle with a Loch Ness monster,\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nfight a werewolf, and eat some lobsters.\n\n10:55.000 --> 11:00.000\nThey're gonna go down to the basement with you.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nThese characters are gonna fight a werewolf\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nand eat some lobsters.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:08.000\nThey're gonna go down to the basement with you.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:19.000\nThese characters are ready to assault you.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:29.000\nRetraining my brain to not go to certain comedic wells at 40.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nThat, if you're gonna do an improv song,\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:34.000\nthat's an unforgiving tempo there, too.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:39.000\nHey man, my life's an unforgiving life.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nAlright, let's...\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nOh, you have a question, sir?\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:47.000\nYeah, if you had to choose between sex or teleportation for the rest of your life,\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:48.000\nwhat would you choose?\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:52.000\nThe question is, if you had to choose between sex or teleportation\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:55.000\nfor the rest of your life,\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nwhich would you choose?\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nI mean, I would ask you your name,\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:06.000\nbut your new name is Segment Saver.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:10.000\nThose other questions, that's amazing.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:13.000\nIf only everyone wanted to know something like that,\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:16.000\neveryone could do a show.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:19.000\nIf sex or teleportation for the rest of my life...\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:22.000\nMeaning, if you chose teleportation, there could be no sex?\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:25.000\nYeah, you can't be pleasured sexually anymore.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nLike, no more orgasms ever.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nYeah, you couldn't...\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nWill that...\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:35.000\nWill that raise my already rising risk of prostate cancer?\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:38.000\nLike, because I know there's certain statistics about that.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nLike, if I don't orgasm five times a week,\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:43.000\nlike, I enter some risk group.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:44.000\nBut what good would teleportation...\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:45.000\nLet's assume no.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nCould you teleport back to a time when you could enjoy sex?\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:48.000\nNo, right?\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:49.000\nIt's teleportation.\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nDad!\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:54.000\nHow does it work, son?\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:55.000\nIt's teleportation.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nIs it a time machine?\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:06.000\nWill you come over and help me reset my teleportation machine?\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nIt keeps blinking 12.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:11.000\nI love that it keeps blinking 12.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nI was about to say that too, and then realized...\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:17.000\nThe reference to it blinking 12 has become the new...\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nMaybe back ribs.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nIt's the new way of recognizing an old person.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:26.000\nWhen we were 15, if your VCR was blinking 12,\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:29.000\nit meant you were 38, because you didn't know how to set it.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:34.000\nAnd now, if you make that reference, people know you're 40.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nThat's funny.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:42.000\nOur VCR reference is blinking 12.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nOur comedy is blinking 12.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:47.000\nAnd nobody here knows how to reset it, because they don't know what it is.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:48.000\nYeah, they're like...\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:49.000\nAnyways...\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:50.000\nSo what are the teleportation...\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nTeleportation or sex?\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:54.000\nBasically, you could teleport anywhere.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:57.000\nYou could, I guess, hold someone and bring them with you.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nYou could teleport anywhere, bring somebody with you.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nOr stuff, I guess.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:05.000\nSo I could teleport and find, like, really viral men to pleasure Aaron\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nand bring them back to the bedroom.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:11.000\nAnd then teleport into the closet dressed as Superman and just watch.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:19.000\nI guess without your penis, you could still pleasure her,\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nbut there's that...\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nWell, that's a big thing, yeah, too.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:24.000\nWhat was that?\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nWell, because if I wasn't in a relationship,\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:27.000\nthat would be...\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:28.000\nI think that would be...\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:33.000\nTeleportation at 40 is very tempting.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nWhere would you...\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nWhat comes to mind when you think of teleporting?\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.000\nTo what?\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:41.000\nJust go in places fast, motherfucker.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:44.000\nInstant travel, anywhere.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:45.000\nYou hate travel.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:48.000\nWell, maybe because I don't have teleportation.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:49.000\nI don't know.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nWell, I guess you bring up an interesting point, I guess.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nWhere would you go, Magellan?\n\n14:55.000 --> 15:00.000\nWell, I mean, it would be like you could teleport to the inside of a bank vault\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nand it would be effective retirement.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.000\nOkay.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:05.000\nSo you become jumper?\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nYeah, you become jumper.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:10.000\nYeah, but what's the point of having all the money in the world\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nif you can't enjoy sex anymore?\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:20.000\nI mean, this question is no longer a metaphor.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:24.000\nAre you at 40 years old still capable of enjoying sex?\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nOf course.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:30.000\nWell, according to my wiener, I come in stuff.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:31.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:35.000\nThat's a good barometer.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:39.000\nBut you'd rather give that up so you could rob banks?\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nI'm weighing it.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:45.000\nYou could just appear on a hammock in Tahiti and be there?\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:50.000\nI'm trying to break it down by wondering how important is sex to me in terms of myself\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:55.000\nand how important is sex to me in terms of keeping Aaron.\n\n15:55.000 --> 16:02.000\nIf I thought that my ability to have an orgasm was the reason Aaron was going to stay with me forever,\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nthen there's also the children thing.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nLike, I want to have a kid.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:07.000\nOh, I can do that.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:12.000\nI could teleport to Vienna and get a doctor to remove my sperm.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:13.000\nOr save it up before you choose.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:14.000\nRight.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:19.000\nI mean, I'm assuming I get like a 36-hour, like, you know.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:23.000\nI get to walk around like at Norton and kind of say goodbye to everybody.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:24.000\nOkay, so you come everywhere.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.000\nAll right.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:29.000\nSo you know what's going to come to that party?\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:34.000\nHey, Dan's getting teleportation instead of sex on Monday.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:37.000\nHe wants everyone to come to the rainbow room.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:38.000\nNo, thank you.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:39.000\nAll right.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:44.000\nSo let's say you, in your 36-hour window, when you've made this choice,\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:48.000\nyou have a doctor from Sweden save your semen in case you ever want to have a child.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:53.000\nYou've cleared it with Aaron and let her know that viral men will fuck her while you dress up in a costume.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nAnd she gets you the thumbs up on that.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:58.000\nAnd she goes, I'll take that bullet.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:03.000\nThen, okay, so you've chosen never to enjoy an orgasm again.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nBut now, where are you going?\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:09.000\nWhat can possibly make that worthwhile?\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:14.000\nI mean, definitely first, Dublin.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:17.000\nBecause the flight delays are killers.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nI just pop over to Dublin.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:20.000\nI don't know, it's a really good question.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:24.000\nI know that there's a good way to use teleportation for a guy with a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:25.000\nFor rescue?\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:26.000\nOh, rescue.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:28.000\nOkay, all right.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:29.000\nHe's right.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:34.000\nYou know what, that's another thing to consider.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:39.000\nIf you have an extraordinary power, you end up getting eaten away by the responsibilities.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nI mean, we all, yeah, fuck that.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:46.000\nEvery time you watch TV, every time there's a 9-11, you're like, fuck me.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:51.000\nI gotta go teleport under rubble and bring people out.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nIs teleportation always in the moment?\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nThere's no time to travel to it, right?\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nNo, it's space, not time.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:00.000\nIt's space, so you can just be somewhere right now.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:04.000\nSo if you're watching 9-11 happen, where are you going to teleport to?\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:08.000\nNew York, you fucking, specifically where?\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:09.000\nIn the building?\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nWell, it's happening on the news.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nAre you willing to come up here?\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nOkay, come up here, please.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:18.000\nAsk him.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:24.000\nHe's the guy that's giving me teleportation or taking away my gonads.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:26.000\nMy name's Connor.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:27.000\nConnor, okay.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:28.000\nHave we met before?\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:29.000\nNo.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:30.000\nOh, okay.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:31.000\nAll right.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nMaybe when we teleported, but that's fine.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:37.000\nOr maybe, maybe Harmontown fans are a type.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:40.000\nTodd Bishop.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:43.000\nTodd Bishop, yeah.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:52.000\nFor you at home, he's, yeah, he doesn't look like Russell Crowe.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:56.000\nYou look like a bit, you look like a young Frank Gorshan.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nIf I knew who that was, I'd probably be...\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:01.000\nHe played the Riddler on the original Batman.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:06.000\nYou're blinking 12, baby.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nNo, I said you guys grown...\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:11.000\nHey, he was a comic on a TV show!\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nRussell Crowe is a Visigoth.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:15.000\nHe's a big, hairy, ursine man.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:19.000\nI was saying this guy's more on the Neil Patrick Harris end of the spectrum, which is equally...\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:23.000\nThere's a lot of handsome men that don't look like Russell Crowe.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:28.000\nI think what we found out is that you guys give Russell Crowe a little too much leeway.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nI refuse to feel bad about that.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:31.000\nI think...\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nConnor, would you like to go out to dinner sometime?\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nI mean, absolutely.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nSee?\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:37.000\nAll right.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:42.000\nAnyway, so in your mind, teleportation, if you did have it, is this something you've thought about?\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:45.000\nYeah, this is actually weird that this got brought up tonight,\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:50.000\nbecause freshman year of college, me and my, like, best friends would debate over this.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nAnd people have...\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:56.000\nMost people, at first, were teleportation back when it was freshman year of college,\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nbut a lot of people have swayed.\n\n19:58.000 --> 19:59.000\nWait, you're kidding.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:04.000\nWhen you were a freshman in college and you could drive nails through boards with your dick,\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:05.000\nthat's when...\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nOh, because you're taking it for granted.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nYou're like, oh, I can give this up for anything.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nOh, my dick's always so hard, it gets in the way.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:12.000\nCan you believe that?\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:15.000\nSo give me a superpower instead, I guess that makes sense.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:19.000\nAnd then when they turn 40, they're like, oh, my kingdom for a boner.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:23.000\nBut you're not 40.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:24.000\nNo.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:25.000\nYou're 25.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:26.000\nTwo.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\n22, not two.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:31.000\nAll right, anyway, so that's already interesting,\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nbut then once you think about it, I guess it makes sense.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:36.000\nThese young, virile men would...\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:37.000\nWhat about women?\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:38.000\nHave you ever asked women this question?\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:42.000\nYeah, most girls, surprisingly, choose sex and more guys,\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:44.000\nwell, now that we're not freshmen in college,\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:48.000\nmost people are choosing sex, but most girls, almost 90% of the time, it's sex.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:49.000\nHuh.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:50.000\nThey all want it, huh?\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.000\nYeah.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nIt was a...\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:54.000\nIt's good to know.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:55.000\nIt was one big plan.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nSex is the ultimate teleportation, man.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:02.000\nAnd when I want to go to another place,\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nI just go to bed with Dan Harmon.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:08.000\nIt kind of forces you to not want to be there.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nIt's like I'm in a bank vault right now.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:19.000\nYeah, everyone that's been to bed with me knows what it's like to...\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:20.000\nAll right, but kind of...\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:21.000\n...remote travel.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:25.000\nLet's say there was a point in your life when you would have chosen teleportation.\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nI mean, still choosing it.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:28.000\nJust still do.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:31.000\nOkay, so then explain to me what the benefits, what makes teleportation.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:34.000\nI want to know the rules of teleportation, too.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nIf I want to go to Madagascar, even though I've never been there,\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:38.000\nand probably couldn't find it on a map, like...\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:41.000\nSee, I think we've gone back and forth on this,\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nand probably thought about it way too much.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:46.000\nBut, I mean, it'd probably be more fun if you could just think it and go,\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:49.000\nas opposed to having been there or seen it on TV.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:54.000\nLike, if you don't have to have been to Ground Zero to teleport there,\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nlike, you can just go.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nBut do I have to kind of know it's on the east coast of the United States?\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:02.000\nYeah, if you can, you can, like, just throw a dart and get close.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:03.000\nThat'll work.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:04.000\nAlright.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:10.000\nSo you could see a national crisis happening on CNN,\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:11.000\nand go there and help people.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:12.000\nYeah, you could.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nIs that the allure of teleportation?\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:17.000\nIs the greater good that you would use this as a superpower?\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:18.000\nI think that's part of it.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:19.000\nI think that's the price.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:20.000\nThat's the price of admission.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nYeah.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nYou could also do a lot of really fun stuff.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:28.000\nRight, okay, so again, now, give me, like, forget the responsibility,\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:30.000\nor include whatever.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:31.000\nLike, think small.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:32.000\nYeah.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nLike, you ever drive past the public museum at night,\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:38.000\nand think like, man, you know, me and my friends could just go in there with a six pack\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:42.000\nand just look at a T-Rex and just hang out.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:43.000\nLike, you could.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:48.000\nYeah, never fuck again, but I want to see that T-Rex so bad.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nI mean, fuck seeing it in the daytime.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nAnd not during business hours.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:52.000\nNo, no.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:56.000\nI guess, and also they have motion sensors instead of the cops would always be coming.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nBut then you could just get the heck out right now.\n\n22:58.000 --> 22:59.000\nYou could teleport right the fuck out.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nWell, let me ask you this, Connor.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nCan I teleport to the moon?\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:04.000\nYou could, but...\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:05.000\nBut you'd die.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:06.000\nYou'd probably...\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:09.000\nWell, I could get a spacesuit.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:12.000\nIf you got a spacesuit, then I think this works.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:16.000\nYeah, and then teleport to the moon with, like, tanks of oxygen and start building a city.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:23.000\nI hate to be a killjoy, but let's say you teleport to NASA where there are spacesuits.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nAnd let's say you find one that fits you.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:29.000\nIt already exists.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:32.000\nYou understand that...\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:35.000\nThat was not a fad joke.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:39.000\nI think 200 people disagree.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:42.000\nThat's on them then.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:43.000\nI'm saying rocket science.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:44.000\nThat was a fad joke.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:48.000\nFor instance, I'm just about six foot four inches.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:51.000\nI'm not going to find me a spacesuit that fits me.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:52.000\nYou think those things are custom made?\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:53.000\nOh, fuck yeah!\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nAnd then also...\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:56.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:57.000\nTeam Taylor fit?\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nNo, you get them off the fucking rack.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:00.000\nNo, I know.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:01.000\nYeah, but you want...\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nYou get a Neiman Marcus and you say, I'll take a...\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:09.000\nBut when you set these guys up in the spaceship, don't you want all of their suits to fit all of them?\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:13.000\nI'm pretty sure Buzz Aldrin's suit was Buzz Aldrin's suit and fit him like a glove.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:22.000\nBut I bet they would be stupid to not let him be able to go, hey, like Neil Armstrong has a peanut allergy and he dies halfway up.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:26.000\nAnd he lands on the button that makes the spaceship go to Venus instead of the moon.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:37.000\nAnd then Aldrin's suit gets all fucked up because whenever Glenn Beck, I don't know the name of another astronaut,\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:44.000\nhe starts eating shit like a moth and tears a hole and so the bottom line is, like, who's...\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nOkay, all right, so let's say...\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:47.000\nWhat do we do?\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nThe answer better be, okay, there's another space suit.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:50.000\nI will grant you...\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:51.000\nOkay, how about this?\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:52.000\nLet's say you roll...\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:57.000\nYou bowl a strike and you go in there and you have short Vince Vaughn's space suit in there.\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nBecause he's still a little chubby.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:02.000\nAnd you go up, this is Goldilocks.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:05.000\nThis one fits perfectly and you try that on.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:08.000\nA team of people need to make sure that thing works.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nLike, you can't just put that thing on and sustain you.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:11.000\nYeah.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:15.000\nLike, again, I'm only asking these questions so I can find out whether...\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nAll right, so I teleport to NASA.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:20.000\nI steal a space suit and you're going to give me this that they got one there.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nThat one fits just right.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:25.000\nWhy don't you bring just both suits so it's not even an issue?\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:26.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nLike, bring the non-fitted suit and then the fitted suit.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nWell, let's say you had ten suits that were all perfect.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:36.000\nYou walk into a giant wardrobe full of space suits and you can just pull them off the rack.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nI'm a 42 long, that's perfect.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nYou get right in there.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:40.000\nSo you have the suit.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:41.000\nNow you need...\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.000\nThis is not something that can operate on its own.\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nYou need help on this, right?\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:46.000\nOn a space suit on the moon.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:47.000\nIf we're going to the moon.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nI don't know, do you?\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nWell, I mean, you could certainly figure that shit out.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nThe hard part of getting to the moon is propulsion.\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:59.000\nWell, also, to put an EVA suit on in a spacecraft, you need like two people to help you get in.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:00.000\nI will have lots of friends.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:01.000\nI believe the teleporting guy.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:02.000\nBut they don't work for NASA.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:06.000\nAnd a lot of those friends will be super hot chicks because they won't feel threatened by me.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:08.000\nBecause I won't be able to...\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:12.000\nI will have so many fucking awesome, smart, hot women friends.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:15.000\nBut they're going to be turned down by the fact that you're going to murder yourself on the moon\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:18.000\nbecause you don't know how to operate a fucking space suit.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nI don't understand your...\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nWell, I haven't even made a decision yet.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:23.000\nOkay, Connor.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:24.000\nIt seems like as long as...\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:28.000\nIt seems like you're happy as long as I'm coming.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:31.000\nDan, I've always been candid about that.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:34.000\nConnor, give me your, like, top three, five.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:39.000\nRift some of your top five or whatever teleportation moments.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nLike, what would you want to do?\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:42.000\nHoly crap.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:43.000\nYeah, you've thought about teleportation a lot.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:44.000\nToo much.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:45.000\nYeah.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:49.000\nOr you can steal ones from your friends.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:56.000\nI guess the question that people always ask right then is can you teleport your dick into a girl's vagina?\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nWhich...\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nDoesn't make sense.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:03.000\nIt's also called rape, I think.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:07.000\nDan, Dan, Dan, don't.\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:09.000\nIs that a rape joke?\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:10.000\nDan, don't.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\nIt was not a rape joke.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.000\nI really, I seriously want to know.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:17.000\nCan you joke about rape jokes?\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:19.000\nCan you make a rape joke joke?\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:21.000\nI can because I'm not famous.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:23.000\nYou can't.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:27.000\nI called my grandma a nigger in that show and nobody cared.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:30.000\nThat's right, how's that going to play in HuffPo?\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:34.000\nBy the way, Jeff Davis dropped an n-bomb too in that show.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:37.000\nNow are you clicking on us?\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:40.000\nYou're right, it's all about the headline.\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:46.000\nOkay, so give me your, what's the pie in the sky teleportation?\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:49.000\nI don't know, it's never been something so specific,\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:54.000\nbut it'd probably just be so much like funny shit to like fuck with people.\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:55.000\nJust pranks.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:56.000\nYeah, all the time.\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.000\nLike that would be so fun.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:01.000\nYeah, you know what else was fun?\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:04.000\nCummin.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:08.000\nBut I, yeah, I wonder what would make Aaron happier,\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nmy wiener or...\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:13.000\nYou leaving him dying on the moon.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:18.000\nI'd see him alone with all that money.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:22.000\nI could take her to Hawaii, I could take her to...\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:23.000\nThe moon.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:27.000\nI could take her to the moon if we find a space suit designed for, you know,\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:30.000\nFomky Johnson.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nWhat?\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nAll right.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:37.000\nI'm still, I mean, I'm only playing devil's advocate here.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nI want to be sold on teleportation.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:42.000\nAnybody else out here have a good teleportation idea?\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:43.000\nInstant skydiving.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:44.000\nInstant skydiving.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:45.000\nOh, right.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nJust remember to teleport before you hit the ground.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:48.000\nRight.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:49.000\nOr before you black out.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:50.000\nYeah.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nYeah, that's because you could always be falling.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:53.000\nThat would be fun.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:54.000\nThat would be good.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:59.000\nI would say this would probably be great for people that have passed their sexual prime.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:03.000\nI think a lot of people would choose this at the age of, like, you know, 58%.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nYou've got, like, Betty White teleporting around.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:08.000\nYeah, Betty White would just be Robin Banks stealing everything.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:12.000\nThere's something about the security, too, also because I'm becoming a doomsday prepper.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:13.000\nI've decided.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:21.000\nLike, that's, if you could teleport, you don't need to waste any energy doomsday prepping.\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:25.000\nYou know, you are prepped for doomsday because you're set.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:30.000\nLike, you're all the more secure in an event of Armageddon.\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nLike, it doesn't matter.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:33.000\nYou wouldn't need a bomb shelter.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:34.000\nYou wouldn't need anything.\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:36.000\nYou could just, like, now you could just hang out.\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nLike, they could go in the news today.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:47.000\nGold dropped three silver points and the Russians are threatening to invade Afghanistan again.\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:50.000\nAnd your friends would be like, oh man, should I buy a shotgun?\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:54.000\nAnd you'd be like, I don't care.\n\n29:54.000 --> 30:00.000\nThey'd be like, kind of like being Highlander except you'd get to die at 60.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:04.000\nWas teleportation your ultimate superpower or are there other ones that are better?\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nOr would you pick that because it might balance the scales?\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nI think it's a good balancer.\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:12.000\nWhat would be your ultimate superpower if you could have one gift?\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:17.000\nI mean, maybe teleportation because I don't want to waste all the time I thought about it.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:22.000\nBut I could at least just throw that out there to make sure that I cover myself.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:25.000\nBut invisibility, flying, all that stuff's cool.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nBut teleportation is like flying, I guess.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:30.000\nWhat would be your big power, Jeff, if you get to choose one?\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:33.000\nI've thought about this with Matt Groly.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:36.000\nWe talked about superpowers that are super.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:40.000\nLike you could fly or you have super strength or invulnerability or whatever.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:45.000\nThere's also mundane superpowers that you can speak every language.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:51.000\nThe rule is you can't become a real criminal and you can't do great good with it.\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:56.000\nSo you can pick something that's kind of cool but you couldn't commit a crime by having that power.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:59.000\nSo if I had a superpower, I'd definitely flight.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:04.000\nIf I had a mundane power, speak every language, be able to talk to anybody in the world.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:05.000\nI think that would be very cool.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:06.000\nThat would be cool.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:07.000\nYeah.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nMaybe you could have both and you'd be like that.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:12.000\nOh, look, it's flying snob.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:13.000\nBonjour!\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:19.000\nEvery time you conjugated wrong in French or something like that.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nMore Beaujolaises even play it.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:26.000\nYou land and go like, it would be Seal L play because she's a woman.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:29.000\nAway!\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:40.000\nAlso, I thought it'd be really cool if you had the power to just be in a room full of people and just go...\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:46.000\nUntil you're enough that you just got groaning and everyone looks at you and just boom!\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:50.000\nIt burst into a pulp of hot blood and meat.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:56.000\nI just go, poof! I just like cover the walls and there's just flesh and brains all over everybody.\n\n31:56.000 --> 32:00.000\nAnd after everybody stops screaming, reform.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nWhy are you embodying that?\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:12.000\nWhy are you encouraging him?\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:18.000\nI think there's three other people that want that power and two of them got the electric chair.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:23.000\nLike you, Connor, I've given mundane superpowers a lot of thoughts.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:26.000\nAnother one is the ability to jump out of any window.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:31.000\nIt could be out of this window here at Meltdown or out of a plane or out of an Empire State building.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:36.000\nAnd jump out of a window and immediately reappear behind people that are looking at the window.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nHere's a guy, mundane one.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:43.000\nI think we talked about this, the ability to manipulate any printed language.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:50.000\nIf you just drive past a billboard and it says, by Levi-G, you could just make it say, go fuck yourself.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:53.000\nLike in the same fonts.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:58.000\nYou could just put Alan Thicke's face up there and there's a dog on his dick.\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:02.000\nYou just wave your hand and it's like, I don't know what you call it.\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:05.000\nI am Photoshopper.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nI am Adobe.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:13.000\nLike when they look back though, it's back to normal and they just really fucked up by the end of the day.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:16.000\nYou could change a Hollywood sign but for 10 seconds.\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:21.000\nWell, I don't know. I mean, I guess that's fun but then you're just making a bunch of people think they're crazy.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:27.000\nIf you could change billboards and then everyone was like, you gotta go up and change that.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:32.000\nI think that breaks my rule of you could use that for evil. You could change the constitution.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:38.000\nYou could easily be like super banksy. You could be like subvert the government.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:41.000\nYou could change serial numbers on money. You could use that for evil.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:46.000\nWell, that's the cool. I just watched one of the four movies we watched in bed today was X-Men First Class,\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:49.000\nwhich is awesome by the way. I guess I'm the last to know that.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nI didn't bother to watch it because there wasn't a big hubbub.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:55.000\nBut I guess when you're 40, the hubbub doesn't reach you.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:59.000\nIt's just 18-year-olds. Their hubbub is contained amongst each other.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:04.000\nThey're probably at the sock hop going, X-Men First Class was great.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:07.000\nAnd then I'm just driving by in my Prius and I don't even hear it.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:12.000\nIt's not like they're going to flag down the car. Hey, old man, you should go see X-Men First Class.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:16.000\nAnd then do a hula hoop with us.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:21.000\nBut I finally watched it today with Aaron and it was really swell, really groovy.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:24.000\nTo quote them in the movie. To use their parlance.\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:27.000\n12, 12, 12.\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:32.000\nBut I thought, do you guys like X-Men First Class?\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:36.000\nIt's like a hootenanny, but with just a movie.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:41.000\nDan, mundane, can't use it for evil, can't use it for good superpower.\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:44.000\nWell, I really like the font one, really.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:48.000\nJust because if you really can't use it for gain.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:53.000\nIf it's conceivable to use that to rob a bank or to commit a crime.\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:58.000\nWell, that's why I thought of X-Men First Class is because the cool thing about these X-Men movies, the X-Men mythology,\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:03.000\nis that if you can think of it and then you really commit to it, if someone's born with it,\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:08.000\nyou reveal that this person has figured out how to use it for good or evil when it does it.\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:14.000\nSo let's just say I can't use my photoshopping ability for good or evil.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:17.000\nI can only use it for entertainment. I think that's a big one for me.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:20.000\nBecause if we could just be in a restaurant, I guess you'd get bored with it.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:25.000\nI would just slide the menu over to you and go, I think Special Number 3 is right up your alley.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nI don't want the dick and balls to happen.\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:32.000\nI had that last night.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:35.000\nConnor, you had a moment to think about this mundane superpower.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nThe mundane one? I've been trying to think right now.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:41.000\nIt's a tough one. If anybody out in the audience has one, in the front row, yes, Miss?\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nJust hover above the ground like two inches.\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:46.000\nTwo inch hover. David Blaine.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:50.000\nTwo inch hover is good because it's cool, but who gives a shit?\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\nExactly.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:55.000\nWhat about control over insects?\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nYou could commit a crime with that.\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nStand in the middle of your garage and go, whew!\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:04.000\nAnd all the roaches kind of just line up in a grid.\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:07.000\nAquaman but for insects?\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:10.000\nI can conceive of ways that you could use that power.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:13.000\nCan you conceive of any? Go with that challenge though.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:16.000\nThere's a way that you could, I mean, there's no such thing as a power.\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:18.000\nExploding into a pulp on people and then reforming.\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:21.000\nSociety is defined by that. Of course you could use that.\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:26.000\nYou could go, for instance, everyone give me a million dollars or I'll come to your party.\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nLike no one wants you to do anything.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nAnd they'd say, why? Go blow up my stuff.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:33.000\nI'm the pulp guy. Have you Google me?\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:36.000\nAnd they'd go, it's cool, but when the death settles, he's just there.\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:39.000\nThat's the problem with that one is because once you've done it a few times, then word gets out.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:43.000\nBut the window thing would always be great.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:47.000\nBecause you'd always find somebody like, oh, World Trade Center.\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:50.000\nThat building's gone. Let me pick a better one.\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:52.000\nI was just trying to pick a tall one.\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:55.000\nFlashin' 12, National Tragedy Flashin' 12.\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nTeleport, teleport.\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nYes? You got one?\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nIf you could change your hands into tools.\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:03.000\nIf you could change your hands into tools.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:09.000\nYou just want to move the baby gate and you're like, where's the number eight socket?\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.000\nAnd then you're just like, yeah.\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:12.000\nThat would be awesome.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:15.000\nYeah, but could you use that for like lock picking stuff like that?\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:18.000\nIs it all tools or do you get like a leather man on your index finger?\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nCan I point something out to you, Jeff, though?\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:21.000\nYeah.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:22.000\nDamn, we're just spitballing.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:23.000\nYeah, I know.\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:29.000\nBut you are hung up on this idea that there's such a thing as a power that normal people don't have\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:32.000\nthat can't be bent to a person's advantage.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:36.000\nSociety is defined by the fact that no one has an edge.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:41.000\nIf anyone that does have an edge has used that edge to gain power over people.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:44.000\nAnd so if you could change your hands into tools.\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:47.000\nSee, that to me gets into super power.\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:48.000\nThat's plastic man.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:49.000\nYou're not listening to me.\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nAll powers are super powers.\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:54.000\nLike David Copperfield can't even actually do anything.\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:58.000\nHe can only make it look like he does some stuff and he's rich and famous.\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:05.000\nI'm only using that as a level to say like you can't cross over into something actually useful.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:06.000\nHe's not listening to me.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:07.000\nHe's not listening.\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:09.000\nIt's like talking to a wall.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:14.000\nPeople keep saying, people are going like, oh, I want a fishing pole for a dick.\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:19.000\nAnd you're going like, wow, I don't know if that counts because you could catch so many fish that you could like...\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nNo, that one counts.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nThat one works.\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:26.000\nNo, you cannot rob a bank with a fishing pole dick.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.000\nIs that, is robbing the bank the litmus test?\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:29.000\nLet's call it that, yes.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:30.000\nOkay, fine.\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:31.000\nAnything you can't rob a bank with.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nOr commit like a major crime with.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nI can commit a major crime with a fishing pole dick.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:36.000\nLet's hear it.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:37.000\nLet's hear it.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:38.000\nOkay.\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:39.000\nFade in.\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:40.000\nOkay.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:46.000\nI come up to you and I go, hey, can I have your social security number?\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:47.000\nNo.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:53.000\nCan I have it if I have a fishing pole for a dick?\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nYou know what?\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:56.000\nAll right.\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:57.000\nSip.\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:58.000\nWhoa.\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:00.000\nWhere's my money?\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:01.000\nYeah.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:02.000\nYeah.\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:06.000\nAnd I usually, I fished it out of your pocket with a, I don't know.\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:09.000\nIf you're always able to correct someone in a conversation.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:12.000\nIf they're wrong, you go, oh, no, actually it's this way.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:13.000\nYou couldn't use that for evil.\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:15.000\nThey're like, oh no, this guy was born in this year.\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:18.000\nYou're like, without looking at your phone, without looking at Google.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:20.000\nSo just the smartest person in the world.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:23.000\nAnd we don't know it until someone says the wrong thing.\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nAnd you're like, well, actually it's this.\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:26.000\nOh, so you don't know everything.\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:28.000\nYou just know when someone's wrong.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:36.000\nYou just, you just have like the, like it's like word, word puts a red squiggly line underneath anything that anyone says.\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:40.000\nIt's called a super asshole.\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:44.000\nIn a room full of scientists and they all just like go through a bunch of statements.\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:45.000\nOh, yes.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:50.000\nBeef fungus bill says that a team of evil geniuses will pull them in and chain them to a chair.\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:51.000\nYeah.\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nThey won't say things until like.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nYeah, they won't use them as the magic mirror.\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nYou know, mirror, mirror of them all.\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:58.000\nYou've been undone.\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:00.000\nYouster had been undone by beef fungus bill.\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:02.000\nYeah, back there.\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:05.000\nYeah, you can control what other people's food tastes like.\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\nYou can control what other, wow.\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:10.000\nControl what other people's food tastes like.\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\nThat's fucked up.\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:16.000\nMr. President, did you enjoy your roast beef sandwich last night?\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:18.000\nIt tasted like poop, but.\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:21.000\nLike will again, unless.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:24.000\nMount Rushmore is.\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:27.000\nMy face four times.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:30.000\nI'll eat poop until I die before I see that happen.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:33.000\nWell, good.\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:39.000\nI don't think, I don't think the OPEC will feel the same.\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\nYes, you sit over there.\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:44.000\nYou could turn into a duck, but you would have the brain of a duck.\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:49.000\nWould a duck be able to control turning back into a human?\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nThere's just a clock on it, I assume, right?\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:54.000\nIt's like, it's like one of those light switches in cheap bathrooms where.\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:56.000\nIt's a dial.\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:59.000\nI'm going to turn into a duck and then he does a gig, a gig, a gig, a gig.\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:04.000\nYou're a duck and that's just walking around wanting to have sex with ducks\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:06.000\nand fly south if it's cold.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:08.000\nIt's like five, five minutes of duck.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:11.000\nJust don't go near like a fancy restaurant because that'd be bad news.\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:14.000\nOr be like near people with shotguns and stuff.\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:16.000\nBut here's a big, I would do this one.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:18.000\nI would say you could be a duck, you could set the timer on it.\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:21.000\nLike you could say I want to be a 10-second duck or a 10-minute duck or whatever.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:24.000\nBut you would do whatever the duck would normally be doing,\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:27.000\nbut you would have your eyes, like you'd be seeing through the duck's eyes.\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:31.000\nSo you could fly and you could be in a pond and you could fuck another duck\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nand you could eat breadcrumbs and shit.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nLike John Malkovich, like at the beginning of being John Malkovich.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:38.000\nYou could eat breadcrumbs, you guys.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:41.000\nDan, he picked duck.

Like, I can't love\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nthese\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nhands.\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nDan managed to destroy one of the keychains,\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000\nand now there's these\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000\nhand-made keychains. I just destroyed mine\n\n01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nin front of Samantha.\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nOh, you got one. Great.\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nOkay. That one I'm going to put in my pocket and put in my...\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nI'm sorry about that.\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000\nThat is awful.\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nAll right.\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000\nSorry, Roy. The charity...\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nWell, so anyway, they don't get drunk.\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nWhat they do is they\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nhelp channel the kids into\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nwhatever programs they have an interest in,\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nand they specify in the arts\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000\nin drama,\n\n01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000\npainting, acting,\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nmusic, because there's not enough of that\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nin the schools now, especially 7th, 8th,\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000\n9th grade kids. So they\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000\ncreate programs for these kids to do after school,\n\n01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nso they're not out just roaming the street\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nand getting in trouble,\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000\nbreaking the law, that kind of thing. And they also do\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nsome sports programs also for them.\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000\nWhat's it called again? It's called After School All Stars.\n\n01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000\nCool. So you can pull it up online. It's a really\n\n01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nnice charity. You can\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000\ndonate to it. You can also...\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nThey look for mentors. So they look for people\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000\nwho are interested in just\n\n01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nhanging out with these kids and\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000\npushing them in the right direction,\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000\nrather than getting in trouble all the time.\n\n01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nSo it's a nice charity.\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000\nAnd also, like our country being a capitalist\n\n01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000\nnation, that\n\n01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000\nis supposed to be an innovative,\n\n01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nlike, industrial\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nnation. We're supposed to come up with\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000\nideas and create things\n\n01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nwhich justifies our\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000\nkind of hegemony and\n\n01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000\nwhere we have been\n\n01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000\nas we have been entering the\n\n01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000\nglobal economy, have been scaling\n\n01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nback on\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000\nour educational programs. And the first\n\n01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000\ncorners that we've been cutting are the\n\n01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000\ncorners that send kids into\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000\nspheres where they become\n\n01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000\ncreative. Right. The whole creativity\n\n01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000\nthing is gone now. They don't\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nhave art programs. They don't have music programs.\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nIf you see somebody\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nthat, you know, that\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000\n7th grader who picks up a trumpet\n\n01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000\nand decides to start playing it, there's\n\n01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000\nnobody to sit there. Right. He goes to school and\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000\ngoes, I found this weird thing I blew into.\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nIt made a noise and the teacher's like, yeah,\n\n01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000\nare you going to be a mechanic or a math teacher?\n\n01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000\nYeah, right.\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000\nI feel so\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nsad.\n\n01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000\nNo, it's good.\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nWe're helping. You\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000\nhave money to help the kids.\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000\nNo, it's great. It's great. It's all very sad.\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000\nWell, there's also like\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000\navian flu and Yellowstone parks going to turn\n\n01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000\ninto a super volcano. Like any\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000\nminute now your heart could stop.\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000\nYou can't draw anymore.\n\n01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000\nThat's so awful.\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000\nYeah. Well, welcome to\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000\nHarmont. Well, they can draw.\n\n01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000\nThey teach kids to draw. It's good.\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nThey'll all be painters.\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nI was going to\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nsay one real quick thing for real\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000\nsuperpower. Mine would be\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000\nI'm just trying to make it happy again.\n\n01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nYou didn't have one?\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000\nWell, I would, my genuine real one\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nwould be time travel. I would do that\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000\njust because I've eaten a lot of shitty pizza,\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nyou know. They're just like, hey,\n\n01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000\ndon't eat it. It's not\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000\ngreat. That's deep. That's very deep.\n\n01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000\nDude, you've had shitty pizza. It's no\n\n01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000\ngood. Knowing you already got\n\n01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000\nall the calories of a\n\n01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000\ngood pizza, but it tastes, listen, we could\n\n01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000\ntalk about this. I was going to say,\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000\nI went to Chicago and asked\n\n01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000\neverybody I met in Chicago, people that worked\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nin restaurants and bars and people that were locals.\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nI polled everybody. What's the best pizza\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000\nin town? I went to a place. It was the shittiest\n\n01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000\nslice of pizza I've ever had in my life. What was it called?\n\n01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nI don't remember. But it was like one\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000\nof the biggies and it was garbage.\n\n01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000\nI'm full of shit pizza right now.\n\n01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000\nI could have gone back in time.\n\n01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000\nCamille, tell everyone about your charity slice of life.\n\n01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000\nIt's about people\n\n01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000\nwho've had shitty pizza.\n\n01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000\nYeah, it's really great.\n\n01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000\nAnd they're a Nike fuel band now.\n\n01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000\nThey have to run so much more\n\n01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000\nand keep up with it. So this doesn't\n\n01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000\ntake money away from them\n\n01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000\nso they can't eat and then they\n\n01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000\nlose that weight. I was actually thinking for a second\n\n01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000\nlike, oh, that would be a good Monday\n\n01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000\nsuper par. The idea to throw a switch\n\n01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000\nwhere you could just eat whatever you wanted\n\n01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000\nand your body wouldn't process it. And I was like, oh, bulimia?\n\n01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000\nYeah.\n\n01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000\nYou can have that power.\n\n01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000\nThe power of condor\n\n01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000\nfeather.\n\n01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000\nBut we were saying like, you know how everyone says\n\n01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000\ngo back, kill Hitler.

01:32:20.000\nthat's working.\n\n01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nAnd we all compliment a different aspect of him.\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000\nI talked to a nearby animal.\n\n01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000\nAre there any animals nearby?\n\n01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nNo, no.\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000\nI was going to have like a wolf go...\n\n01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000\nThat's

I'm afraid they're going to explode from a rousal.\n\n01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000\nWhich is what happens\n\n01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000\nevery time a woman gets aroused.\n\n01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000\nIs that they swell up to the point of explosion.\n\n01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.000\nWhich is why you chose teleportation.\n\n01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000\nLet's do it.\n\n01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000\nAlright, alright.\n\n01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000\nSo it's 5, 6, 5...\n\n01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000\n5, 6, 7, 8, right?\n\n01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000\n5, 6, 5, 6, 7,

01:34:02.000\npenalties from losing your shadows.\n\n01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000\nI might not have changed those.\n\n01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000\nAlright, so...\n\n01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000\nHe's 150 feet away from us right now.\n\n01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000\nHe's closer now.\n\n01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000\nWhat's the battlefield\n\n01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000\nthat

blocking it off and there's those slimy devils.\n\n01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000\nYeah, yeah, then there's\n\n01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000\nRoy and he came from kind of the north\n\n01:34:24.000 -->

could...\n\n01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000\nSearing light is the only thing you'd hit him with.\n\n01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000\nThe rest you'd have to be pretty close.\n\n01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000\nAlright, well let's hit him with searing light.\n\n01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000\nOkay,\n\n01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000\npraying to your gods.\n\n01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000\nYou see a light open up in the heavens\n\n01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000\nand a shaft of white light\n\n01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000\npierces down from the sky\n\n01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000\nand blasts directly into\n\n01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000\nthe devil's face.\n\n01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000\nWow.\n\n01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000\nHe's the devil?\n\n01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000\nHe's a devil.\n\n01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000\nOkay, cool.\n\n01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000\nI wish we'd known that before we tried\n\n01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000\nall these other weird tactics.\n\n01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000\nWe thought he was Bob Fosse.\n\n01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000\nI thought he was like World Dollars BFT.\n\n01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000\nYeah.\n\n01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000\nI was literally picturing Michael McDonald\n\n01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000\nwalking everybody like, hey, how's it going?\n\n01:35:46.000 -->

not like an Atari game.\n\n01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000\nNo, it looks like Scorpion from Mortal Kombat\n\n01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000\nto get over here.\n\n01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000\nIt's

in.\n\n01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000\nHow much less accurate?\n\n01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000\nLike minus two.\n\n01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000\nOh, that's worth the fuck it.\n\n01:38:04.000 -->

01:38:22.000\nOh.\n\n01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000\nAnd he's Jewish?\n\n01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000\nHello!\n\n01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000\nOkay.\n\n01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000\nDealing two damage.\n\n01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000\nTwo damage, but it's a poison dagger,\n\n01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000\nso it'll slowly work its way.\n\n01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000\nDevils are immune to poison.\n\n01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000\nMy dad ran into that same problem.\n\n01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000\nOh, really?\n\n01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:38:52.000 -->
