{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:19.520\nLadies and gentlemen, welcome.\n\n00:19.520 --> 00:25.760\nHarmontown is now officially in session.\n\n00:25.760 --> 00:29.760\nThank you for coming down to Hollywood, California in the Nerdmelt Theater.\n\n00:29.760 --> 00:32.520\nAnd those of you listening out in podcast universe, thank you.\n\n00:32.520 --> 00:37.520\nPlease join us all in welcoming the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:37.520 --> 00:46.560\nAll right, welcome.\n\n00:46.560 --> 00:51.320\nWelcome to my magical forest of microphones.\n\n00:51.320 --> 00:55.680\nI have tied a red ribbon around the one that has a pot of gold under it.\n\n00:55.680 --> 00:59.680\nDo you ever hear that leprechaun story, Jeff?\n\n00:59.680 --> 01:02.840\nJeff, have you ever heard that old leprechaun story?\n\n01:02.840 --> 01:06.760\nThere's not a single leprechaun story I haven't heard, Dan.\n\n01:06.760 --> 01:12.280\nThe guy catches a leprechaun and he says, give me your pot of gold, which is what you're\n\n01:12.280 --> 01:15.000\nright if you catch a leprechaun.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:17.200\nBut the leprechaun can still fuck with you a little bit.\n\n01:17.200 --> 01:20.560\nHe has, like, options left.\n\n01:20.560 --> 01:25.640\nAnd so this leprechaun says to the guy, okay, I'll give you that.\n\n01:25.640 --> 01:27.360\nGive you my pot of gold.\n\n01:27.360 --> 01:29.200\nCome to the forest tomorrow.\n\n01:29.200 --> 01:32.680\nIt's under the tree with the red ribbon around it.\n\n01:32.680 --> 01:35.920\nAnd so, of course, maybe some of you see where this is going.\n\n01:35.920 --> 01:39.000\nBut this is a golden age for leprechauns.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:40.440\nPeople weren't that savvy yet.\n\n01:40.440 --> 01:47.200\nThey hadn't watched enough CW shows and Grim hadn't aired yet.\n\n01:47.200 --> 01:50.080\nPeople were mythically deaf and blind.\n\n01:50.080 --> 01:55.640\nSo he let the fucking leprechaun go based on that promise alone shows up a whole forest\n\n01:55.640 --> 01:58.320\nof trees with red ribbons around them.\n\n01:58.320 --> 02:00.320\nThis is not a pot of gold you're going to get tonight.\n\n02:00.320 --> 02:05.520\nWhat you're going to get tonight is a podcast of gold.\n\n02:05.520 --> 02:10.880\nNo, it wasn't a podcast of gold.\n\n02:10.880 --> 02:15.400\nPot, no, it doesn't matter.\n\n02:15.400 --> 02:16.400\nNothing matters.\n\n02:16.400 --> 02:17.400\nI'm in a good mood.\n\n02:17.400 --> 02:18.400\nI'm very excited.\n\n02:18.400 --> 02:22.400\nI'm nervous when I come up, I go, I don't know, I feel, as I've said before, bio-rhythmically,\n\n02:22.400 --> 02:24.840\nI feel like, well, I'm not witty tonight.\n\n02:24.840 --> 02:25.840\nI have nothing to say.\n\n02:25.840 --> 02:26.840\nI'm tongue-tied.\n\n02:26.840 --> 02:34.920\nMy frontal lobe is a little fatigued, perhaps from some intricate sex game I played.\n\n02:34.920 --> 02:39.960\nBut then sometimes I come up and I go, oh, man, I'm really going to slay people.\n\n02:39.960 --> 02:41.160\nI can't wait to get up.\n\n02:41.160 --> 02:44.240\nThis is one of those nights it doesn't matter because we have Greg Proups coming up here.\n\n02:44.240 --> 02:47.320\nGreg Proups is here tonight.\n\n02:47.320 --> 02:48.320\nSo who cares?\n\n02:48.320 --> 02:49.320\nIt's really on him.\n\n02:49.320 --> 02:50.320\nYeah.\n\n02:50.320 --> 02:51.320\nIt's on him.\n\n02:51.320 --> 02:53.400\nIt's just a Greg Proups show.\n\n02:53.400 --> 02:55.840\nIf this show sucks, it's simply on his shoulders.\n\n02:55.840 --> 02:56.840\nYeah.\n\n02:56.840 --> 03:00.720\nI'll sabotage it so I can walk away from those going, I don't see what the big deal of Greg\n\n03:00.720 --> 03:01.720\nProups is.\n\n03:01.720 --> 03:03.240\nI had him on my show.\n\n03:03.240 --> 03:07.680\nIt didn't turn into diamonds.\n\n03:07.680 --> 03:14.640\nBut more so than that, he's a good friend of Jeff's and, therefore, by proxy, a much\n\n03:14.640 --> 03:16.120\nadored friend of mine.\n\n03:16.120 --> 03:20.960\nWe went and saw his podcast in San Francisco in January, last January at Sketchfest.\n\n03:20.960 --> 03:22.600\nI was blown away.\n\n03:22.600 --> 03:26.960\nI think that's when I got the nuts up to, were we already doing this and recording it\n\n03:26.960 --> 03:27.960\nand podcasting it?\n\n03:27.960 --> 03:28.960\nNo.\n\n03:28.960 --> 03:30.120\nNo, we weren't.\n\n03:30.120 --> 03:31.120\nJust after.\n\n03:31.120 --> 03:35.720\nSo he's actually kind of a bit of an unwitting Obi-Wan to this show, I think, because I\n\n03:35.720 --> 03:39.240\nsat there in a comedy club and watched Proups just babble into a microphone and, of course,\n\n03:39.240 --> 03:42.360\nI thought, well, then I'll do it.\n\n03:42.360 --> 03:46.880\nThen put it on iTunes and make people listen to it.\n\n03:46.880 --> 03:55.760\nBut he's going to specifically come up primarily to play Dungeons and Dragons with us.\n\n03:55.760 --> 04:00.080\nWe have Spencer, our Dungeon Master, sitting anxiously on deck.\n\n04:00.080 --> 04:01.080\nYeah.\n\n04:01.080 --> 04:04.080\nSpencer is like a Brahmin bull.\n\n04:04.080 --> 04:05.080\nIs that a kind of?\n\n04:05.080 --> 04:06.080\nBrahma.\n\n04:06.080 --> 04:07.080\nBrahma bull.\n\n04:07.080 --> 04:08.760\nA Brahmin bull is more of like a Hindu kind of.\n\n04:08.760 --> 04:10.080\nA Brahmin bull is no big deal.\n\n04:10.080 --> 04:12.080\nThey're very relaxed.\n\n04:12.080 --> 04:13.080\nYeah.\n\n04:13.080 --> 04:15.800\nThey're no danger at all.\n\n04:15.800 --> 04:21.960\nHealth update.\n\n04:21.960 --> 04:26.960\nLast week, I explained that I had been having these light-headed spells and I've been hot\n\n04:26.960 --> 04:29.640\non the trail on how to figure out what's wrong with them.\n\n04:29.640 --> 04:34.200\nVitamin D deficiency epiphanies, magnesium epiphanies, potassium epiphanies.\n\n04:34.200 --> 04:39.400\nAnd then I told the story of how Aaron gave me the anxiety epiphany at the San Diego Zoo.\n\n04:39.400 --> 04:42.880\nOh, it's just anxiety, as soon as I knew that, everything was fine.\n\n04:42.880 --> 04:46.640\nBut then that very night of the podcast, it was like, still, I'm having these light-headed\n\n04:46.640 --> 04:47.640\nspells.\n\n04:47.640 --> 04:49.160\nI got to go back into the doctor.\n\n04:49.160 --> 04:51.240\nEven though I got all this blood work, what's wrong with me?\n\n04:51.240 --> 04:52.240\nWhat is it?\n\n04:52.240 --> 04:53.680\nThere's nothing wrong with my lab results.\n\n04:53.680 --> 04:57.120\nI go back into the doctor, I tell him about these light-headed spells.\n\n04:57.120 --> 04:59.360\nAnd he diagnosed me.\n\n04:59.360 --> 05:03.520\nThe bad news is I have respiratory alkalosis.\n\n05:03.520 --> 05:07.440\nAnd the good news is that's like the hiccups.\n\n05:07.440 --> 05:12.440\nAnd his prescription was literally to breathe less.\n\n05:12.440 --> 05:16.320\nRespiratory alkalosis is when you accidentally hyperventilate.\n\n05:16.320 --> 05:18.600\nAnd that's it.\n\n05:18.600 --> 05:24.840\nAnd it's a syndrome in the short term where if you're undergoing stress, good or bad,\n\n05:24.840 --> 05:30.680\nyou kind of accidentally breathe just a hair too deeply, then you get a little light-headed.\n\n05:30.680 --> 05:32.240\nAnd then you go, I'm getting light-headed.\n\n05:32.240 --> 05:37.320\nAnd then so you go, you flood your body with oxygen because you want to clear your head.\n\n05:37.320 --> 05:39.200\nAnd then it gets worse and worse.\n\n05:39.200 --> 05:43.240\nAnd then the more it gets worse, and the one thing I hadn't tried, because it just doesn't\n\n05:43.240 --> 05:47.760\nseem like a good idea in those moments, is breathing less.\n\n05:47.760 --> 05:49.160\nAnd that's all I have to do.\n\n05:49.160 --> 05:50.760\nAnd I've tried it like seven times.\n\n05:50.760 --> 05:55.080\nI've had little things come on, and then I exhale like I have the hiccups, and then\n\n05:55.080 --> 05:56.480\nI just take shallow breaths.\n\n05:56.480 --> 05:57.880\nI felt like the biggest dick.\n\n05:57.880 --> 06:01.680\nWell, when you say breathing less, you mean inhale less?\n\n06:01.680 --> 06:02.680\nYeah.\n\n06:02.680 --> 06:04.040\nDon't take a big breath and hold it.\n\n06:04.040 --> 06:05.760\nJust exhale and hold it.\n\n06:05.760 --> 06:08.720\nWhich makes you feel like you're going to die, but then at the same time, it clears\n\n06:08.720 --> 06:09.720\nmy head up.\n\n06:09.720 --> 06:11.480\nBut doesn't that give you a stroke at some point?\n\n06:11.480 --> 06:13.600\nIf you deoxygenate your brain?\n\n06:13.600 --> 06:22.040\nWell, no, not when you have too much oxygen in your blood, which is why you're feeling\n\n06:22.040 --> 06:23.040\nlight-headed.\n\n06:23.040 --> 06:24.120\nIt's fucking weird.\n\n06:24.120 --> 06:28.400\nYour body runs on this balance of gases, CO2 and O2.\n\n06:28.400 --> 06:34.320\nAnd if you have less CO2, even though CO2 is bad, it's not like we use it for anything,\n\n06:34.320 --> 06:36.920\nbut if the balance is, I'm sure we use it for a lot.\n\n06:36.920 --> 06:41.720\nDon't write me any letters, you fucking CO2 heads.\n\n06:41.720 --> 06:43.200\nWe use it for trees.\n\n06:43.200 --> 06:46.840\nYeah, we give back to the earth.\n\n06:46.840 --> 06:51.640\nIf it's slightly imbalanced, you have a regulator in your head that will eventually make you\n\n06:51.640 --> 06:55.760\nfaint, and what fainting is, is just your body going, this guy can't breathe right\n\n06:55.760 --> 07:01.400\non his own, and just knock him out, and I'll take it from here, and then regulates your\n\n07:01.400 --> 07:02.400\nbreathing and you wake up.\n\n07:02.400 --> 07:05.840\nAnd I think that's why women fainted, you know, that whole fainting couch culture.\n\n07:05.840 --> 07:10.160\nThey were wearing corsets and tying them really tight, so they were fucking with the balance\n\n07:10.160 --> 07:14.520\nof the gases in their bodies, so women were regularly fainting, and then the men who designed\n\n07:14.520 --> 07:16.520\nthe corsets would say, well, you're hysterical.\n\n07:16.520 --> 07:19.520\nThis is something that women do, they're psychos.\n\n07:19.520 --> 07:21.520\nLet's get that corset off right now.\n\n07:21.520 --> 07:25.880\nOh, yeah, no, keep it on, but let's not let them vote.\n\n07:25.880 --> 07:30.800\nOkay, so, but I don't need to get political tonight, because we have Greg Proups here.\n\n07:30.800 --> 07:32.800\nIt's on him, no.\n\n07:32.800 --> 07:34.800\nWere you bringing him up?\n\n07:34.800 --> 07:36.800\nNo, no, no, no, I mean, I will now.\n\n07:36.800 --> 07:39.480\nI wanted to update you on my respiratory alkalosis.\n\n07:39.480 --> 07:41.560\nIt's a new thing I'm going to blame for everything.\n\n07:41.560 --> 07:42.560\nRespiratory alkalosis.\n\n07:42.560 --> 07:46.160\nSo to recap, bring up the, I like that it has alcohol in it.\n\n07:46.160 --> 07:54.200\nI know, no, believe me, he said, it's respiratory alkalosis, and I went, oh fuck, here it is.\n\n07:54.200 --> 07:56.280\nThe glory days are gone.\n\n07:56.280 --> 07:58.680\nYou have a cute, you have a cute vodcosis.\n\n07:58.680 --> 08:02.000\nYeah, I was so excited that it was an alkaloid thing.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:09.760\nI was like, yes, oh, oh, 10 more years, 10 more years.\n\n08:09.760 --> 08:18.600\nOne of drinking and eight of not knowing what eight plus one is.\n\n08:18.600 --> 08:24.320\nThat was a, that was a quotable, you just watched my brain die a little bit.\n\n08:24.320 --> 08:29.240\nI'm, I'm no scientist or a doctor, and I'm not bad at math and putting things together,\n\n08:29.240 --> 08:31.480\nbut why don't you just wear a corset?\n\n08:31.480 --> 08:33.480\nThat's a good idea.\n\n08:33.480 --> 08:34.480\nStick a corset on.\n\n08:34.480 --> 08:37.320\nWell, I don't know if the corset makes more CO2 or less CO2.\n\n08:37.320 --> 08:38.320\nI don't know why women are paining.\n\n08:38.320 --> 08:41.800\nIt makes it harder for you to inhale oxygen, so you're probably going to do-\n\n08:41.800 --> 08:42.800\nToo much CO2, right?\n\n08:42.800 --> 08:43.800\nYeah.\n\n08:43.800 --> 08:44.800\nSo, okay, I'm going to start wearing a corset.\n\n08:44.800 --> 08:48.080\nAll right, I mean, and then, I mean, not that you haven't lost a lot of weight, but\n\n08:48.080 --> 08:49.080\nstill.\n\n08:49.080 --> 08:50.080\nSo it can only help.\n\n08:50.080 --> 08:51.080\nTwo birds with one stone.\n\n08:51.080 --> 08:54.520\nIt's like a really tight shatner girdle.\n\n08:54.520 --> 08:56.640\nYeah, you look like Robert Misham.\n\n08:56.640 --> 08:59.240\nAnd I'll just, I'll just, I'll just have a hair checker for challenging people to\n\n08:59.240 --> 09:00.240\nfight.\n\n09:00.240 --> 09:02.240\nSo it's like, what are you talking about?\n\n09:02.240 --> 09:03.240\nGet up here.\n\n09:03.240 --> 09:04.240\nI won't accept it.\n\n09:04.240 --> 09:05.240\nJust punch you out.\n\n09:05.240 --> 09:10.520\nI'll have seen a sweat, and then I'll just make out with the nearest, most racially\n\n09:10.520 --> 09:15.120\ndiverse woman in the audience to simulate her being green.\n\n09:15.120 --> 09:18.080\nWait, you're only going to fight when you're on stage?\n\n09:18.080 --> 09:19.080\nYeah, I don't know, man.\n\n09:19.080 --> 09:21.680\nI lost track of what I was saying.\n\n09:21.680 --> 09:24.520\nLet's try to, let's try to, I don't want to get on a lot of tangents tonight.\n\n09:24.520 --> 09:29.080\nIs it because you hung out with Greg Proops, Greg Proops right before the show?\n\n09:29.080 --> 09:39.520\nYeah, no, I think that said, I updated you on my health situation, and I think, I haven't\n\n09:39.520 --> 09:40.520\nseen you a lot.\n\n09:40.520 --> 09:42.520\nYou were, you were, you were gone last week.\n\n09:42.520 --> 09:44.440\nYou were gone when I was gone, and then you were gone again.\n\n09:44.440 --> 09:46.080\nI haven't seen you at all.\n\n09:46.080 --> 09:47.080\nIt's exciting.\n\n09:47.080 --> 09:48.080\nI miss you, Dan.\n\n09:48.080 --> 09:50.200\nIt's cool that while you were gone last week, Erin could fill in.\n\n09:50.200 --> 09:56.760\nYeah, well, I listened to the raw, the raw file of the, of the last Harmontown when\n\n09:56.760 --> 10:04.000\nyou guys played, when Erin McGathy guest-controlled, and I heard the Dungeons and Dragons where\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:05.720\nwe introduced a new character.\n\n10:05.720 --> 10:06.720\nYeah.\n\n10:06.720 --> 10:07.720\nYeah.\n\n10:07.720 --> 10:08.720\nYeah.\n\n10:08.720 --> 10:16.920\nAnd she, and that character became a, it was very, it was very vocal?\n\n10:16.920 --> 10:21.560\nIt was very, it was very pro-active about becoming a permanent member of the adventuring\n\n10:21.560 --> 10:22.560\nparty.\n\n10:22.560 --> 10:28.160\nYeah, but, I mean, part of it, a lot of it was kind of overtly begging to be a regular\n\n10:28.160 --> 10:31.160\nmember of a campaign.\n\n10:31.160 --> 10:35.120\nJeff and Erin have kind of a sibling rivalry.\n\n10:35.120 --> 10:38.800\nHe calls her the girl in the treehouse, or the little sister in the treehouse.\n\n10:38.800 --> 10:41.040\nShe's like a little sister in a treehouse.\n\n10:41.040 --> 10:42.040\nYeah.\n\n10:42.040 --> 10:46.600\nOur next guest.\n\n10:46.600 --> 10:49.520\nHe was described by Herman Melville as...\n\n10:49.520 --> 10:54.840\nThe biggest asshole in every sale.\n\n10:54.840 --> 10:59.240\nHe's an awesome, really, he's truly the smartest man in the world, and he hosts a podcast called\n\n10:59.240 --> 11:00.240\nThe Smartest Man in the World.\n\n11:00.240 --> 11:04.120\nHe blew my mind at San Francisco, he's one of Jeff's very good friends from the Who's\n\n11:04.120 --> 11:10.400\nLine world, and he's amazing, and we're thrilled to have him here as a surprise friend.\n\n11:10.400 --> 11:11.720\nLet's bring Greg Proups up.\n\n11:11.720 --> 11:16.720\nGreg Proups, everybody.\n\n11:16.720 --> 11:27.280\nYeah, anyway, you can go there, if you like.\n\n11:27.280 --> 11:28.760\nFrank is there.\n\n11:28.760 --> 11:29.760\nYeah.\n\n11:29.760 --> 11:30.760\nGreg Proups.\n\n11:30.760 --> 11:31.760\nYeah.\n\n11:31.760 --> 11:35.720\nYou know, I've been sitting backstage listening to this, what is it, carbon dioxide you're\n\n11:35.720 --> 11:36.720\ntalking about or whatever?\n\n11:36.720 --> 11:39.800\nWhat a load of shit, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n11:39.800 --> 11:40.800\nThere's no global warming.\n\n11:40.800 --> 11:42.520\nI don't know what the fuck he's talking about.\n\n11:42.520 --> 11:46.600\nIf you just breathe normally, penguins never die.\n\n11:46.600 --> 11:52.880\nSay, I never read the paper or anything, it's good to have somebody up here who's informed.\n\n11:52.880 --> 11:53.880\nYeah.\n\n11:53.880 --> 11:56.720\nWho was it, oxygen and carbon dioxide, was it?\n\n11:56.720 --> 12:01.120\nYeah, yeah, yeah, there's a delicate balance between them and your bloodstream.\n\n12:01.120 --> 12:04.520\nI feel weird standing in front and then staring back over my shoulder.\n\n12:04.520 --> 12:05.520\nI like the Greg Proups.\n\n12:05.520 --> 12:07.480\nTelly McGillis on the top gun poster.\n\n12:07.480 --> 12:11.840\nQueen to Rook 4.\n\n12:11.840 --> 12:15.160\nThe most dangerous game of all.\n\n12:15.160 --> 12:17.160\nNot hunting a human, but human chess.\n\n12:17.160 --> 12:21.640\nThe most dangerous game is when you're just loose on an island.\n\n12:21.640 --> 12:24.840\nThe human chess is actually relatively safe.\n\n12:24.840 --> 12:31.400\nYou could end up being like one of many pieces that lives to the end, sorry.\n\n12:31.400 --> 12:37.720\nSo Greg Kitten, yeah, Dan Kitten.\n\n12:37.720 --> 12:40.000\nGreg, would you rather sit?\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:43.800\nWell, no, I don't want Dan to be uncomfortable, he just said he didn't want to look behind\n\n12:43.800 --> 12:44.800\nhim.\n\n12:44.800 --> 12:45.800\nOh, sit here.\n\n12:45.800 --> 12:46.800\nThere you go.\n\n12:46.800 --> 12:47.800\nThank you.\n\n12:47.800 --> 12:48.800\nIs that what comptrolling is?\n\n12:48.800 --> 12:49.800\nMoving chairs?\n\n12:49.800 --> 12:55.320\nI've always wondered, shouldn't it be chomp trolling then?\n\n12:55.320 --> 12:58.840\nThank you for that mild laughter, that's what.\n\n12:58.840 --> 13:02.840\nI had a jade actually warranted that small of a response.\n\n13:02.840 --> 13:07.520\nYou were exactly right and you're measured and fucking well thought out response.\n\n13:07.520 --> 13:12.280\nGreg, might I say that I appreciate you spending the last 10 minutes in the green room alone\n\n13:12.280 --> 13:16.720\nwith a vodka and then you came on stage and went headlong straight for the vodka again?\n\n13:16.720 --> 13:21.720\nMy glass was almost empty when I got out here and my entire life flashed before my eyes.\n\n13:21.720 --> 13:23.280\nLike a Guy Madden movie, perplexing.\n\n13:23.280 --> 13:27.560\nI don't think the edge of the pool is no longer, you just start to panic and the defense.\n\n13:27.560 --> 13:28.560\nYeah, exactly.\n\n13:28.560 --> 13:34.560\nExcept the deep end consists of a deep level of lack of vodka.\n\n13:34.560 --> 13:35.560\nExactly.\n\n13:35.560 --> 13:40.520\nIt's like an ever diminishing, vanishing point full of vodka.\n\n13:40.520 --> 13:43.560\nWe should have Spencer come up and start prepping his little table, right?\n\n13:43.560 --> 13:44.880\nI always make that mistake.\n\n13:44.880 --> 13:47.040\nWe've had Spencer up here.\n\n13:47.040 --> 13:48.040\nIs Spencer here?\n\n13:48.040 --> 13:49.040\nYeah.\n\n13:49.040 --> 13:50.040\nOh, okay.\n\n13:50.040 --> 13:51.040\nThere he is.\n\n13:51.040 --> 13:52.040\nAll right.\n\n13:52.040 --> 13:53.040\nSpencer, everybody.\n\n13:53.040 --> 13:54.040\nHi, Spencer.\n\n13:54.040 --> 14:01.480\nSpencer, of course, for those of you just joining in, Spencer is our 611 D&D Dungeon\n\n14:01.480 --> 14:02.480\nMaster.\n\n14:02.480 --> 14:04.480\nHow's your parents?\n\n14:04.480 --> 14:07.040\nThey don't want me to live with them.\n\n14:07.040 --> 14:08.040\nI'll just be in a dick.\n\n14:08.040 --> 14:10.040\nOh, we don't do that in Harmontown?\n\n14:10.040 --> 14:11.040\nI'm sorry.\n\n14:11.040 --> 14:12.040\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\n14:12.040 --> 14:14.520\nI forgot this was a basket of cookie kind of place.\n\n14:14.520 --> 14:15.520\nI didn't realize it.\n\n14:15.520 --> 14:17.520\nI brought a basket of vitriol.\n\n14:17.520 --> 14:19.520\nIt's so inappropriate.\n\n14:19.520 --> 14:23.480\nIt's a safe place, but like Oscar the Grouch on Sesame Street, I mean, you're welcome within\n\n14:23.480 --> 14:24.480\nan hour.\n\n14:24.480 --> 14:27.480\nIf you have vitriol, we're only going to make you feel good about having it.\n\n14:27.480 --> 14:28.480\nOkay, thank you.\n\n14:28.480 --> 14:31.480\nBecause I felt uncomfortable just then, but now I feel better again.\n\n14:31.480 --> 14:32.480\nSee?\n\n14:32.480 --> 14:33.480\nThat's what we do.\n\n14:33.480 --> 14:36.480\nNext week, you'll be farming potatoes with us and...\n\n14:36.480 --> 14:40.640\nI'll see you on the ice.\n\n14:40.640 --> 14:43.800\nSo Greg has never played Dungeons & Dragons before, correct?\n\n14:43.800 --> 14:44.800\nEven though you...\n\n14:44.800 --> 14:49.960\nNo, but I will say this, and I hope I'm not stepping on any pointed shoes that curl over\n\n14:49.960 --> 14:55.480\nlike that, but are made of green felt when I say this, I think dragons are a plague.\n\n14:55.480 --> 14:57.760\nAnd I'll go further.\n\n14:57.760 --> 14:58.760\nThey have to be eradicated.\n\n14:58.760 --> 15:04.800\nAnd even if it requires going to a secret place, such as a cavern or perhaps an airy\n\n15:04.800 --> 15:08.480\non top of a mountain that they live in, I am willing to go through the series of questions\n\n15:08.480 --> 15:13.480\nthat have to be asked, and obstacles that have to be surmounted, and perhaps even groups\n\n15:13.480 --> 15:19.160\nof gremlins that are filled with animosity toward anyone who's heading toward the dragon.\n\n15:19.160 --> 15:20.160\nIt sounds like...\n\n15:20.160 --> 15:22.920\nI know you've never played before, but it sounds like you're going to do great.\n\n15:22.920 --> 15:23.920\nI just...\n\n15:23.920 --> 15:28.880\nI don't play it professionally, but in my mind, I've played it many times.\n\n15:28.880 --> 15:33.120\nThe dragon is my agent, and the mountain is Wilshire Boulevard.\n\n15:33.120 --> 15:34.680\nIt's pretty weird how I play it.\n\n15:34.680 --> 15:37.880\nDid you ever play Hot Lava when you were a kid, or anything like that, like just make\n\n15:37.880 --> 15:38.880\nbelieve on the playground?\n\n15:38.880 --> 15:39.880\nYeah.\n\n15:39.880 --> 15:40.960\nHot Lava was a goodie.\n\n15:40.960 --> 15:41.960\nWe also...\n\n15:41.960 --> 15:46.400\nWhat I love about what we actually played Ring Around the Rosey when I was little, and\n\n15:46.400 --> 15:48.400\nisn't that like a medieval...\n\n15:48.400 --> 15:49.400\nFrom the plague.\n\n15:49.400 --> 15:50.400\nRight.\n\n15:50.400 --> 15:51.400\nI mean, like, why are we playing plague games?\n\n15:51.400 --> 15:52.400\nDid you have...\n\n15:52.400 --> 15:53.400\nWas that even a game?\n\n15:53.400 --> 15:54.400\nIt's just a fruity dance that...\n\n15:54.400 --> 15:55.400\nRight.\n\n15:55.400 --> 15:56.400\nIt just ends with everyone laying down, right?\n\n15:56.400 --> 15:57.400\nWell, that was the best part.\n\n15:57.400 --> 15:58.400\nEveryone would lay down.\n\n15:58.400 --> 15:59.400\nOh, yeah.\n\n15:59.400 --> 16:00.400\nLadies man, coming through.\n\n16:00.400 --> 16:01.400\nExactly.\n\n16:01.400 --> 16:02.400\nThat's four.\n\n16:02.400 --> 16:03.400\nGreg.\n\n16:03.400 --> 16:07.400\nI wonder what you'd like to share my popsicle, I could split it in half.\n\n16:07.400 --> 16:12.320\nGreg, even though you did not play Dungeons and Dragons, you did, if I'm not mistaken,\n\n16:12.320 --> 16:18.080\nwear like a cape or a top hat at some point, didn't you have some kind of gothy affected\n\n16:18.080 --> 16:19.080\nclothes?\n\n16:19.080 --> 16:22.320\nWell, I don't know, gothy douchey.\n\n16:22.320 --> 16:24.560\nI went to my junior prom and I carried a cane.\n\n16:24.560 --> 16:25.560\nThat was 1970s...\n\n16:25.560 --> 16:26.560\n1976, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n16:26.560 --> 16:27.560\nThat was fine.\n\n16:27.560 --> 16:28.560\nThank you.\n\n16:28.560 --> 16:29.560\nThank you very much.\n\n16:29.560 --> 16:31.800\nSame hair, parted down the middle.\n\n16:31.800 --> 16:33.600\nSame hair, parted down the middle.\n\n16:33.600 --> 16:34.600\nOkay.\n\n16:34.600 --> 16:35.600\nThank you.\n\n16:35.600 --> 16:36.600\nThat was probably...\n\n16:36.600 --> 16:37.600\nAnd no, I didn't get any.\n\n16:37.600 --> 16:38.600\nNo?\n\n16:38.600 --> 16:39.600\nNo.\n\n16:39.600 --> 16:41.600\nUnsuccessful life, the junior prom.\n\n16:41.600 --> 16:46.160\nWe went to Portland and there's no segue.\n\n16:46.160 --> 16:49.160\nI wore a sky blue tux, if that's if you're interested.\n\n16:49.160 --> 16:50.160\nSky blue tux.\n\n16:50.160 --> 16:52.120\nYeah, with a waistcoat.\n\n16:52.120 --> 16:53.480\nAnd you affected a cane as well.\n\n16:53.480 --> 16:55.880\nI carried a cane that had a lion head on it.\n\n16:55.880 --> 16:56.880\nRight.\n\n16:56.880 --> 17:02.880\nA lion head was in order to keep pussy at bay.\n\n17:02.880 --> 17:06.520\nBeating them up with a stick, even though you weren't beating them up with a stick.\n\n17:06.520 --> 17:10.400\nI could have dipped that stick in ambergris and dollars and never got a girl to come\n\n17:10.400 --> 17:14.000\nnear me.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.760\nTo bloons.\n\n17:16.760 --> 17:19.480\nWhen did you find your sexuality?\n\n17:19.480 --> 17:24.160\nWhen did you become the rampant sexual mare, I'm sorry, a stallion rather.\n\n17:24.160 --> 17:28.680\nOh, so I'm beveling and so passive aggressive, what you just did out of here.\n\n17:28.680 --> 17:31.040\nWe don't have enough time to discuss the mare.\n\n17:31.040 --> 17:32.040\nBackhanded Davis.\n\n17:32.040 --> 17:33.040\nYeah.\n\n17:33.040 --> 17:34.040\nI don't know.\n\n17:34.040 --> 17:35.040\nProbably 15, I think.\n\n17:35.040 --> 17:36.880\nI had a girlfriend when I was 16.\n\n17:36.880 --> 17:37.880\nIs that too late in the game?\n\n17:37.880 --> 17:38.880\nThat's young.\n\n17:38.880 --> 17:39.880\nIs it young?\n\n17:39.880 --> 17:40.880\nYeah.\n\n17:40.880 --> 17:41.880\nThank you.\n\n17:41.880 --> 17:43.880\nThat was Dan's girlfriend.\n\n17:43.880 --> 17:44.880\nIt was.\n\n17:44.880 --> 17:45.880\nI'd like to point that out.\n\n17:45.880 --> 17:46.880\nIt's an ally.\n\n17:46.880 --> 17:48.880\nYou were starting a thought and I rudely jumped back.\n\n17:48.880 --> 17:50.880\nI was starting a new thought though.\n\n17:50.880 --> 17:54.880\nIf we could keep following the, do you want to talk about when you lost your virginity?\n\n17:54.880 --> 17:55.880\nOh, no, not at all.\n\n17:55.880 --> 17:56.880\nNo, no.\n\n17:56.880 --> 18:03.040\nThis is the open Anthony show in which case it's a du regur.\n\n18:03.040 --> 18:08.000\nWe went to Portland and Portland is a very liberal, progressive city.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:11.560\nThere's a lot of deconstruction of a lot of boundaries going on there.\n\n18:11.560 --> 18:14.680\nThings that you wouldn't even expect to be, to need to be deconstructed.\n\n18:14.680 --> 18:17.000\nWe went to a bar called the green dragon.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:18.520\nAaron went to the bathroom.\n\n18:18.520 --> 18:23.240\nAgain, a place that I would avoid until the dragon is slain.\n\n18:23.240 --> 18:25.760\nI shall not be going through the portals of the green dragon.\n\n18:25.760 --> 18:27.320\nSorry, Dan.\n\n18:27.320 --> 18:32.240\nShe came back and a little traumatized and said that the bathrooms instead of being\n\n18:32.240 --> 18:37.960\nmen and women were sitting and standing.\n\n18:37.960 --> 18:40.680\nSo it's a new way to like break down.\n\n18:40.680 --> 18:41.680\nIt is you say.\n\n18:41.680 --> 18:42.680\nYeah.\n\n18:42.680 --> 18:48.960\nSo if you really think about that, one bathroom was for nothing but men taking shits and women,\n\n18:48.960 --> 18:49.960\nall women.\n\n18:49.960 --> 18:55.200\nAnd the other bathroom was for just men who had to do nothing but pee.\n\n18:55.200 --> 19:00.760\nIt's like the worst, if you're going to like rearrange the bathrooms, that's the worst\n\n19:00.760 --> 19:07.920\nthing you could do to women ever is just add shitting men to their side of the war.\n\n19:07.920 --> 19:13.880\nAnd Jeff pointed out, well, there's lots of unisex bathrooms, but those are bathrooms\n\n19:13.880 --> 19:17.960\nthat have a toilet and a mirror and a sink and a lock on the door.\n\n19:17.960 --> 19:22.400\nSo yes, women have to suffer the misfortune in those situations of having to go pee or\n\n19:22.400 --> 19:25.640\npoop after a man peed or pooped.\n\n19:25.640 --> 19:31.360\nThis bathroom, the sitting bathroom had several stalls in it.\n\n19:31.360 --> 19:39.680\nShe was in there with another woman peeing and a guy in between them grunting and making\n\n19:39.680 --> 19:40.680\na real mess.\n\n19:40.680 --> 19:45.920\nIt's such a horrible violation of everything we know to be right.\n\n19:45.920 --> 19:53.640\nI understand the impulse to modernize everything and second guess are precursors, but there\n\n19:53.640 --> 19:57.680\nare a couple of things that cavemen got right.\n\n19:57.680 --> 20:02.920\nAnd one of them was the idea that women should be nowhere near men's shit.\n\n20:02.920 --> 20:03.920\nOr men's shitting.\n\n20:03.920 --> 20:04.920\nYes.\n\n20:04.920 --> 20:07.440\nThe next thing we'll be going in the kitchen, you know what I mean?\n\n20:07.440 --> 20:08.440\nThere's a few areas.\n\n20:08.440 --> 20:09.440\nNo.\n\n20:09.440 --> 20:11.080\nNever the twain shall meet, as they say.\n\n20:11.080 --> 20:14.400\nNext thing you know, dragons will be outside of dungeons.\n\n20:14.400 --> 20:15.400\nEasy, Craig.\n\n20:15.400 --> 20:16.520\nNot on my watch.\n\n20:16.520 --> 20:17.520\nEasy.\n\n20:17.520 --> 20:21.920\nNot as long as my scimitar nembutal has a mind to say about it.\n\n20:21.920 --> 20:22.920\nDown nembutal.\n\n20:22.920 --> 20:26.080\nCraig, if you're going to blow.\n\n20:26.080 --> 20:27.080\nBlow cool.\n\n20:27.080 --> 20:35.080\nAll right, so you notice there's a forest of microphones up here.\n\n20:35.080 --> 20:40.040\nThat's because, as we mentioned last week, Erin McGathy was guest comptrolling.\n\n20:40.040 --> 20:43.520\nSo she had a character made for her in our D&D campaign.\n\n20:43.520 --> 20:50.680\nAnd much to Jeff Chagrin, she made herself a part of the campaign permanently.\n\n20:50.680 --> 21:03.640\nSo Erin McGathy needs to come up and play her character, Erin McGathy.\n\n21:03.640 --> 21:10.480\nAnd then we welcome back in his selfless rule as the puppeteer of the cosmos, Dungeon Master\n\n21:10.480 --> 21:11.480\nSpencer.\n\n21:11.480 --> 21:12.480\nSpencer, everybody!\n\n21:12.480 --> 21:13.480\nWho can forget?\n\n21:13.480 --> 21:18.480\nHow's it going, you guys?\n\n21:18.480 --> 21:21.120\nGreg, I'm sorry about that neck kiss.\n\n21:21.120 --> 21:23.280\nI forced you into a neck kiss.\n\n21:23.280 --> 21:24.280\nI didn't even notice.\n\n21:24.280 --> 21:26.280\nI was just happy to see you again.\n\n21:26.280 --> 21:30.240\nYou were the only person who applauded during one of the earlier things I said.\n\n21:30.240 --> 21:34.560\nThis crowd has mounted against me like a fucking Romney rally.\n\n21:34.560 --> 21:35.560\nThey're Harmonites.\n\n21:35.560 --> 21:41.720\nI mean, they have a xenophobic, you know, anything that's not Harmon.\n\n21:41.720 --> 21:43.200\nOh, because I'm an Alice Lander?\n\n21:43.200 --> 21:44.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n21:44.200 --> 21:45.920\nBut that doesn't mean they don't accept you.\n\n21:45.920 --> 21:47.160\nThey're protective of me.\n\n21:47.160 --> 21:49.360\nThey're scared you might go for my throat.\n\n21:49.360 --> 21:50.360\nI understand.\n\n21:50.360 --> 21:55.880\nI had a dog when I was a kid that bit a guy because he was throwing away newspapers and\n\n21:55.880 --> 21:59.920\nhe was holding a wire and he was protecting my brother and we had to put it down.\n\n21:59.920 --> 22:00.920\nOh no.\n\n22:00.920 --> 22:03.040\nAll right, let's move on.\n\n22:03.040 --> 22:06.640\nDid that story really end with the death of a beloved dog?\n\n22:06.640 --> 22:07.640\nYeah, it did.\n\n22:07.640 --> 22:09.720\nFuck, you're brave like Disney.\n\n22:09.720 --> 22:11.720\nBut then there were puppies.\n\n22:11.720 --> 22:13.720\nWhen we got home, there were puppies.\n\n22:13.720 --> 22:15.720\nI bought a zoo.\n\n22:15.720 --> 22:24.080\nBeethoven, get off the couch.\n\n22:24.080 --> 22:28.080\nYou are never more than five minutes in the movie we bought a zoo from a character shrugging\n\n22:28.080 --> 22:29.960\nand saying we bought a zoo.\n\n22:29.960 --> 22:32.280\nI just want you to know that.\n\n22:32.280 --> 22:36.560\nAnd that is never a sign of a confidently written film.\n\n22:36.560 --> 22:43.760\nImagine if you were watching Star Wars and every five minutes, I just went, Star Wars.\n\n22:43.760 --> 22:45.680\nThey never said it once.\n\n22:45.680 --> 22:47.680\nCitizen Kane never went, you know, no one ever went.\n\n22:47.680 --> 22:48.680\nCitizen Kane.\n\n22:48.680 --> 22:49.680\nYou're real Citizen Kane.\n\n22:49.680 --> 22:51.680\nYou're fired, Citizen Kane.\n\n22:51.680 --> 22:53.680\nIt's, you know, it's just a...\n\n22:53.680 --> 22:57.320\nNow Dan, what compelled you to buy that movie because first of all, I've never heard of\n\n22:57.320 --> 22:58.320\nit.\n\n22:58.320 --> 22:59.440\nSecond of all, what the fuck?\n\n22:59.440 --> 23:01.360\nWe went through every fucking movie ever.\n\n23:01.360 --> 23:04.960\nWe watched, we watched Savages with Travolta.\n\n23:04.960 --> 23:05.960\nWe watched...\n\n23:05.960 --> 23:06.960\nSafe House.\n\n23:06.960 --> 23:07.960\nSafe House.\n\n23:07.960 --> 23:08.960\nWhich one?\n\n23:08.960 --> 23:09.960\nSafe House.\n\n23:09.960 --> 23:10.960\nIt's everyone.\n\n23:10.960 --> 23:11.960\nThat's the weird D&D character.\n\n23:11.960 --> 23:12.960\nI don't know.\n\n23:12.960 --> 23:21.120\nMan, I know we walked away from Portland $177 into bad Hollywood.\n\n23:21.120 --> 23:24.960\nLike, they got us, the house won.\n\n23:24.960 --> 23:25.960\nYou bought these or rented these?\n\n23:25.960 --> 23:26.960\nWell, I don't know.\n\n23:26.960 --> 23:27.960\nWhat do you call it?\n\n23:27.960 --> 23:28.960\nWe rented them.\n\n23:28.960 --> 23:29.960\nAt the hotel.\n\n23:29.960 --> 23:30.960\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n23:30.960 --> 23:31.960\nI got some.\n\n23:31.960 --> 23:36.440\nAnd I rented a lot of movies while Dan was sleeping and he woke up to We Bout a Zoo.\n\n23:36.440 --> 23:37.760\nIt's not about me.\n\n23:37.760 --> 23:40.760\nDungeons and Dragons.\n\n23:40.760 --> 23:41.760\nWe Bought a Zoo.\n\n23:41.760 --> 23:42.760\nWe Bought a Zoo.\n\n23:42.760 --> 23:43.760\nWe Bought a Zoo.\n\n23:43.760 --> 23:44.760\nThat's fine.\n\n23:44.760 --> 23:46.200\nIt's fine that you Bought a Zoo.\n\n23:46.200 --> 23:51.760\nThe problem is then you made a movie about it and I'm watching it.\n\n23:51.760 --> 23:53.760\nYou have my money.\n\n23:53.760 --> 23:55.760\nWe Bought a Zoo.\n\n23:55.760 --> 23:57.760\nDan was half asleep during the entire movie.\n\n23:57.760 --> 24:02.760\nI was just waking up in like a fever dream saying, Bought a Zoo?\n\n24:02.760 --> 24:04.760\nAnd then back asleep.\n\n24:04.760 --> 24:06.760\nSay it one more time.\n\n24:06.760 --> 24:08.320\nThere was no conflict in the movie.\n\n24:08.320 --> 24:10.960\nThey Bought a Zoo.\n\n24:10.960 --> 24:15.960\nIf you mapped it on my story circle, six of the eight points on the circle would say,\n\n24:15.960 --> 24:18.960\nWe Bought a Zoo.\n\n24:18.960 --> 24:19.960\nWow.\n\n24:19.960 --> 24:20.960\nTo be fair, to be fair.\n\n24:20.960 --> 24:24.960\nIn the middle of the film, the truth that they arrive at is that they Bought a fucking\n\n24:24.960 --> 24:25.960\nZoo.\n\n24:25.960 --> 24:30.960\nTo be fair, that movie was written using a story puddle.\n\n24:30.960 --> 24:33.960\nHalfway through, did they lose the zoo?\n\n24:33.960 --> 24:34.960\nNo!\n\n24:34.960 --> 24:35.960\nNo!\n\n24:35.960 --> 24:38.960\nHalfway through, they said, We Bought a Zoo.\n\n24:38.960 --> 24:40.960\nWhich they Bought on page 10.\n\n24:40.960 --> 24:46.960\nThey fucking Bought it and then they just sat on it and ran it.\n\n24:46.960 --> 24:48.960\nWell, that's Higer Died.\n\n24:48.960 --> 24:50.960\nThey kept contriving things.\n\n24:50.960 --> 24:52.960\nThis is based on a true story about, guess what?\n\n24:52.960 --> 24:54.960\nThey Bought a fucking Zoo and nothing happened.\n\n24:54.960 --> 24:57.960\nIt's based on a true story about going to the dry cleaner.\n\n24:57.960 --> 25:00.960\nSo if you make that a new movie, you have to break it up with contrivances.\n\n25:00.960 --> 25:02.960\nIt rains in the movie.\n\n25:02.960 --> 25:03.960\nIt rains for days.\n\n25:03.960 --> 25:05.960\nIt's not going to rain.\n\n25:05.960 --> 25:11.960\nIf they were sitting there, these writers are going like, What is the enemy of a zoo?\n\n25:11.960 --> 25:15.960\nWhat's the Mechagodzilla to a zoo's Godzilla?\n\n25:15.960 --> 25:16.960\nRain.\n\n25:16.960 --> 25:17.960\nRain.\n\n25:17.960 --> 25:19.960\nI never go to the zoo when it rains.\n\n25:19.960 --> 25:23.960\nGod damn it, Preskin, you're a genius.\n\n25:23.960 --> 25:25.960\nOkay, how do you get rid of rain?\n\n25:25.960 --> 25:26.960\nHow do you get rid of rain?\n\n25:26.960 --> 25:27.960\nWait a while.\n\n25:27.960 --> 25:29.960\nSir, you wait.\n\n25:29.960 --> 25:32.960\nAnd then it stops raining after, God damn it, you're right!\n\n25:32.960 --> 25:33.960\nAnd that's what happens.\n\n25:33.960 --> 25:35.960\nIt rains for a while, then it stops raining.\n\n25:35.960 --> 25:37.960\nThen there's a tree in the road.\n\n25:37.960 --> 25:39.960\nThen the people find out they can walk around the tree.\n\n25:39.960 --> 25:41.960\nI'm not exaggerating.\n\n25:41.960 --> 25:46.960\nAnd every time one of these contrived high points happens, they cue this like,\n\n25:46.960 --> 25:48.960\nAwimawai Awimawai.\n\n25:48.960 --> 25:52.960\nThey're just this fucking shitty African Paul Simon shit.\n\n25:52.960 --> 25:56.960\nIt's just designed to don't worry, be happy, you're aorta.\n\n25:56.960 --> 26:03.960\nIt just goes in your chest like an invasive...\n\n26:03.960 --> 26:05.960\nAfrican people just chanting things.\n\n26:05.960 --> 26:06.960\nDan, who's the bad guy?\n\n26:06.960 --> 26:09.960\nWho's the bad guy?\n\n26:09.960 --> 26:10.960\nYou.\n\n26:10.960 --> 26:12.960\nFor watching it.\n\n26:12.960 --> 26:14.960\nAnd I'm not kidding.\n\n26:14.960 --> 26:16.960\nBecause the movie keeps jabbing you in the ribs and going,\n\n26:16.960 --> 26:19.960\nWhy aren't you crying, you scrooge?\n\n26:19.960 --> 26:22.960\nWhy aren't you crying like everyone in the movie?\n\n26:22.960 --> 26:24.960\nThey bought a zoo, you dick.\n\n26:24.960 --> 26:26.960\nNo one comes in and goes like,\n\n26:26.960 --> 26:29.960\nNice place for a zoo.\n\n26:29.960 --> 26:31.960\nOr an oil well.\n\n26:31.960 --> 26:33.960\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n26:33.960 --> 26:36.960\nThe last person who put one here sank into an enormous crater.\n\n26:36.960 --> 26:39.960\nNo, that's one of six things missing from the story.\n\n26:39.960 --> 26:41.960\nIs a guy going like,\n\n26:41.960 --> 26:43.960\nYeah, you know what's under this zoo?\n\n26:43.960 --> 26:44.960\nDiamonds.\n\n26:44.960 --> 26:46.960\nBlood diamonds.\n\n26:46.960 --> 26:48.960\nLion killing blood diamonds.\n\n26:48.960 --> 26:53.960\nWe're gonna have blind children come in and dig them out with toothbrushes.\n\n26:53.960 --> 26:55.960\nBut the lions will eat them.\n\n26:55.960 --> 26:56.960\nThat's the point.\n\n26:56.960 --> 26:58.960\nBut I thought you wanted the diamonds.\n\n26:58.960 --> 27:00.960\nI'm high.\n\n27:00.960 --> 27:03.960\nYou're the bad guy and you're high, yes.\n\n27:03.960 --> 27:06.960\nI didn't buy a zoo.\n\n27:06.960 --> 27:08.960\nHoney, I just woke up.\n\n27:08.960 --> 27:10.960\nWe didn't buy a zoo.\n\n27:10.960 --> 27:12.960\nNo you did, you bought a zoo.\n\n27:12.960 --> 27:14.960\nI just woke up a third time, it's like conception.\n\n27:14.960 --> 27:17.960\nZoo.\n\n27:17.960 --> 27:21.960\nWe bought a dream zoo, dream zoo.\n\n27:21.960 --> 27:23.960\nZoo conspiracy.\n\n27:23.960 --> 27:25.960\nThe lion was the architect.\n\n27:25.960 --> 27:28.960\nIt was the lion's dream the whole time.\n\n27:28.960 --> 27:30.960\nYou're in the zoo.\n\n27:30.960 --> 27:32.960\nYeah.\n\n27:32.960 --> 27:34.960\nWe bought a zoo.\n\n27:34.960 --> 27:37.960\nThey shrug and they say we bought a zoo a million times.\n\n27:37.960 --> 27:39.960\nAlright, so we've gone on.\n\n27:39.960 --> 27:42.960\nI don't want to get off on any tangents tonight.\n\n27:42.960 --> 27:48.960\nDan, I think if at any point this train jumps the tracks during Harmontown,\n\n27:48.960 --> 27:51.960\nyou could just say, I got a podcast.\n\n27:51.960 --> 27:53.960\nI got a podcast.\n\n27:53.960 --> 27:55.960\nI got a town.\n\n27:55.960 --> 27:59.960\nYou know, Kettle One tweeted me today.\n\n27:59.960 --> 28:02.960\nI'm just saying in a world where we're doing sponsored bits,\n\n28:02.960 --> 28:05.960\nI have a relationship with Kettle One.\n\n28:05.960 --> 28:07.960\nBoth internally and externally.\n\n28:07.960 --> 28:10.960\nI have a fundamental relationship with Kettle One\n\n28:10.960 --> 28:12.960\nin that it's the spinach to my pot pie.\n\n28:12.960 --> 28:15.960\nYou have respiratory alcoholism.\n\n28:15.960 --> 28:18.960\nAnd then now I have my Twitter buddy.\n\n28:18.960 --> 28:20.960\nI don't know, I'm just saying.\n\n28:20.960 --> 28:23.960\nSo are you saying we should drop Nike as our unofficial sponsor?\n\n28:23.960 --> 28:27.960\nIf you have fun tonight, it may be indirectly the result of Kettle One.\n\n28:27.960 --> 28:30.960\nI can almost guarantee it.\n\n28:30.960 --> 28:33.960\nI have some copy written down from a Nike shoe.\n\n28:33.960 --> 28:35.960\nWhy don't we just plug a new Kettle One shoe?\n\n28:35.960 --> 28:37.960\nGive it a shot.\n\n28:37.960 --> 28:39.960\nThe new Kettle One Tiempo,\n\n28:39.960 --> 28:44.960\ncombining the perfect blend of comfort and superior ball feel.\n\n28:44.960 --> 28:46.960\nI'm just going to stop there.\n\n28:46.960 --> 28:48.960\nBall view?

By foot? On horse? How are we going?\n\n39:52.960 --> 39:58.960\nYou're walking on foot, Mulraine's leading the path, bending over and looking at all sorts of signs and symbols of possible animal.\n\n39:59.960 --> 40:00.960\nThis way, regard my asshole.\n\n40:02.960 --> 40:07.960\nYou come upon the remains of a burned field. The path seems to stop.\n\n40:07.960 --> 40:11.960\nNo one walk on this field. It's burned.\n\n40:12.960 --> 40:13.960\nStop.\n\n40:13.960 --> 40:15.960\nWell, that means that Mulraine must have been here.\n\n40:15.960 --> 40:16.960\nThe Ember Mahler.\n\n40:16.960 --> 40:17.960\nEmber Mahler.\n\n40:17.960 --> 40:18.960\nMulraine is...\n\n40:19.960 --> 40:20.960\nThere's Ember Mahler.\n\n40:20.960 --> 40:21.960\nOh my God, he followed us.\n\n40:22.960 --> 40:24.960\nHe's like a homeless guy in Koreatown.\n\n40:25.960 --> 40:27.960\nShoo, shoo, shoo.\n\n40:28.960 --> 40:30.960\nFour coppers, you cheap son of a bitch.\n\n40:30.960 --> 40:37.960\nWait, Spencer, I pick up a stick.\n\n40:38.960 --> 40:39.960\nI throw the stick back toward the town.\n\n40:40.960 --> 40:41.960\nAll right, I'm going.\n\n40:43.960 --> 40:46.960\nBut don't say I didn't warn you.\n\n40:47.960 --> 40:49.960\nNow he's from Puerto Rico? What the hell is going on?\n\n40:51.960 --> 40:54.960\nI am John Lithgow in Bakarubanzai.\n\n40:54.960 --> 40:59.960\nHe left sandwiches.\n\n41:00.960 --> 41:01.960\nAll right, we're in a burnt field.\n\n41:02.960 --> 41:04.960\nAll right, I investigate the field.\n\n41:04.960 --> 41:08.960\nAfter the old man leaves, you turn around to investigate the field\n\n41:08.960 --> 41:11.960\nand notice that a white horse has been trotting into view.\n\n41:12.960 --> 41:16.960\nBut no normal white horse was this, for it was a unicorn.\n\n41:19.960 --> 41:21.960\nDo you know how rare these things are?\n\n41:21.960 --> 41:22.960\nA chew.\n\n41:23.960 --> 41:28.960\nThe unicorn bends down and touches its horn to what looks like a charred dead rabbit.\n\n41:28.960 --> 41:31.960\nYou see a blinding flash of light and a healthy rabbit.\n\n41:31.960 --> 41:33.960\nWow, boing, boing, boing.\n\n41:34.960 --> 41:35.960\nAnd bounces into the underbrush.\n\n41:36.960 --> 41:37.960\nThat's not there because it's a burnt field.\n\n41:37.960 --> 41:39.960\nWait, it brought the rabbit back to life?\n\n41:39.960 --> 41:41.960\nIt seemed to bring the rabbit back to life.\n\n41:42.960 --> 41:44.960\nSharpie, Neil Sadaka.\n\n41:44.960 --> 41:47.960\nNeil Sadaka.\n\n41:48.960 --> 41:49.960\nMulraine Muldoon?\n\n41:52.960 --> 41:53.960\nMulraine Saldana?\n\n41:53.960 --> 41:54.960\nYes.\n\n41:55.960 --> 41:57.960\nThat horse just touched a dead rabbit and it came back to life.\n\n41:58.960 --> 41:59.960\nThat's no horse quark.\n\n41:59.960 --> 42:00.960\nIt's no horse.\n\n42:00.960 --> 42:01.960\nThat's what he said.\n\n42:03.960 --> 42:04.960\nIt's a unicorn.\n\n42:07.960 --> 42:08.960\nIt's a unicorn.\n\n42:08.960 --> 42:09.960\nIt's a horse with one horn.\n\n42:09.960 --> 42:10.960\nIt's a unicorn.\n\n42:10.960 --> 42:13.960\nI am Tylenol with codeine.\n\n42:15.960 --> 42:19.960\nAnd a warm sense of well-being should imbue your body with my very presence.\n\n42:19.960 --> 42:22.960\nSteve the Rabbit, I have brought it back to life.\n\n42:22.960 --> 42:23.960\nWhat be your name?\n\n42:24.960 --> 42:25.960\nTylenol with codeine.\n\n42:27.960 --> 42:29.960\nI thought you just said you were high on codeine.\n\n42:29.960 --> 42:31.960\nNo, I'm Tylenol with codeine.\n\n42:31.960 --> 42:34.960\nI'm the good kind of Tylenol, not the disappointing kind.\n\n42:35.960 --> 42:39.960\nDear unicorn, why this rabbit and not the entire field?\n\n42:39.960 --> 42:40.960\nI am selective.\n\n42:45.960 --> 42:49.960\nTylenol, did you see the ember mauler that did this?\n\n42:49.960 --> 42:50.960\nThe ember maul.\n\n42:50.960 --> 42:52.960\nOh, they are most evil.\n\n42:52.960 --> 42:55.960\nMuch who havoc have they wrought upon the land.\n\n42:55.960 --> 43:00.960\nI used to prance freely amongst the daisies and gladiolas, the snapdragons and the...\n\n43:00.960 --> 43:01.960\nWhat are those little purple ones?\n\n43:01.960 --> 43:02.960\nI love those.\n\n43:03.960 --> 43:04.960\nTulips.\n\n43:04.960 --> 43:06.960\nNo, I have not met you.\n\n43:06.960 --> 43:16.960\nAnd yet, the ember maul, much havoc have reeked and they must be stopped for this land was once pure.\n\n43:18.960 --> 43:22.960\nNow it is fouled with the horrible stench of their enormous wands.\n\n43:23.960 --> 43:26.960\nHave you seen, have you done battle with them before?\n\n43:26.960 --> 43:31.960\nSeen them, I have smelt them from kilometers away, for my senses are most highly developed.\n\n43:31.960 --> 43:34.960\nI would say acute, but the old man used it earlier.\n\n43:34.960 --> 43:35.960\nAnd?\n\n43:35.960 --> 43:41.960\nCharmy, I care not to do battle alongside this winged horse who speaketh so fruitily.\n\n43:41.960 --> 43:42.960\nWhat?\n\n43:42.960 --> 43:46.960\nFruitily I speaketh, thou art a basket of raspberries thyself.\n\n43:48.960 --> 43:53.960\nWhy dost thou not give me thy name, O Jamba Juice, and I will inform you when your cup is ready.\n\n43:53.960 --> 43:54.960\nOh!\n\n43:54.960 --> 43:55.960\nOh!\n\n43:55.960 --> 44:00.960\nWhite stallion, I shall disembowel thee with my sword for words so important.\n\n44:00.960 --> 44:01.960\nWarck!\n\n44:01.960 --> 44:02.960\nTake it easy.\n\n44:02.960 --> 44:06.960\nUnicorns are very powerful, he could make a most unlikely ally.\n\n44:06.960 --> 44:09.960\nPifty threatens not your love.\n\n44:09.960 --> 44:11.960\nAre thou but half-elf?\n\n44:11.960 --> 44:12.960\nYes.\n\n44:12.960 --> 44:15.960\nI am half-elf, and I can speak for myself.\n\n44:18.960 --> 44:22.960\nIndeed, thy companions art most sexist.\n\n44:22.960 --> 44:27.960\nI agree, sir, but it matters not, for I am like the breeze.\n\n44:27.960 --> 44:30.960\nI flow and pleasure.\n\n44:30.960 --> 44:34.960\nLike the wind thou dost blow.\n\n44:34.960 --> 44:42.960\nI, unicorn, may I become your ally and ride you, or you can ride me, although my back will break,\n\n44:42.960 --> 44:45.960\nbut I want to not be a unicornist.\n\n44:45.960 --> 44:51.960\nIndeed, Elflet, thoust may mount me while thine friends trail behind and step away from my stool\n\n44:51.960 --> 44:53.960\nin a haphazard manner.\n\n44:55.960 --> 44:56.960\nHa ha ha!\n\n44:56.960 --> 45:02.960\nWell, how do you like that?\n\n45:05.960 --> 45:08.960\nListen, maybe we should split up.\n\n45:10.960 --> 45:11.960\nWhat is that ahead?\n\n45:11.960 --> 45:12.960\nI see an emerald light.\n\n45:12.960 --> 45:16.960\nIs it not true, Spencer, who holdeth the book?\n\n45:17.960 --> 45:19.960\nOn the horizon, you see a light.\n\n45:19.960 --> 45:22.960\nIt seems to be a fire, but it is not spreading.\n\n45:22.960 --> 45:25.960\nIt does appear to be coming closer.\n\n45:25.960 --> 45:26.960\nUh-oh.\n\n45:26.960 --> 45:28.960\nI see ember muller headlights.\n\n45:30.960 --> 45:31.960\nPossibly.\n\n45:31.960 --> 45:37.960\nIndeed, for the ember mull, I have mispronounced it.\n\n45:37.960 --> 45:43.960\nListen, gang, if this beast is as dangerous as its wake of destruction is suggested,\n\n45:43.960 --> 45:48.960\nit might be prudent for us to find a hiding spot and wait until it gets there.\n\n45:48.960 --> 45:50.960\nYou sound unsure.\n\n45:50.960 --> 45:51.960\nI'm just a little high.\n\n45:51.960 --> 45:56.960\nYou told me last night that you, or this morning rather, that you'd found a crystal\n\n45:56.960 --> 45:58.960\nof the greatness of something.\n\n45:58.960 --> 46:01.960\nMight that be of any value to us?\n\n46:01.960 --> 46:04.960\nPossibly, yeah.\n\n46:04.960 --> 46:13.960\nOh, dickless human, who like one oviparous strode behind me when thoust might have mounted\n\n46:13.960 --> 46:16.960\nif thou had objected in any way.\n\n46:16.960 --> 46:18.960\nWouldst thou not use thine talisman?\n\n46:18.960 --> 46:22.960\nFor I have the power to...\n\n46:22.960 --> 46:24.960\nI have the power to detect evil.\n\n46:24.960 --> 46:25.960\nYeah.\n\n46:25.960 --> 46:28.960\nAnd evil I do detect.\n\n46:28.960 --> 46:31.960\nYou detect evil coming from the direction of the fire.\n\n46:31.960 --> 46:32.960\nOh.\n\n46:32.960 --> 46:33.960\nShit.\n\n46:33.960 --> 46:35.960\nBalm-a-gee.\n\n46:35.960 --> 46:40.960\nDost thou wish to bone out, or dost thou wish to grow a pair?\n\n46:40.960 --> 46:43.960\nWould there be any visual cover in this area?\n\n46:43.960 --> 46:44.960\nWhere are we?\n\n46:44.960 --> 46:49.960\nThere's some large rocks and some skeletal burnt trees to your right.\n\n46:49.960 --> 46:51.960\nLet's hide behind those rocks, you guys.\n\n46:51.960 --> 47:02.960\nAs a creature with wild empathy, I wish to approach the light, for I feel for the light.\n\n47:02.960 --> 47:08.960\nI too burn inside with a green light, albeit not exactly a green light, but I wish to\n\n47:08.960 --> 47:09.960\napproach the light.\n\n47:09.960 --> 47:11.960\nYou wish to approach the fire.\n\n47:11.960 --> 47:12.960\nIt burns closer.\n\n47:12.960 --> 47:18.960\nYou can see it is getting close enough to make out, and it is not just a fire, but the\n\n47:18.960 --> 47:20.960\nform of a powerful feline.\n\n47:20.960 --> 47:26.960\nIt seems to be the size of a lion, but with a flaming mane and twin tails made of fire.\n\n47:26.960 --> 47:28.960\nWas I clear about hiding behind a rock?\n\n47:28.960 --> 47:30.960\nYeah, you're behind a rock.\n\n47:30.960 --> 47:32.960\nShe's walking towards this.\n\n47:32.960 --> 47:35.960\nThe unicorn determined that it was absolutely evil.\n\n47:35.960 --> 47:38.960\nMoldane by the tears of Salduron!\n\n47:38.960 --> 47:41.960\nHide ye self!\n\n47:41.960 --> 47:49.960\nI would like to say that my character has also read the great Gatsby, so I'm intrigued by\n\n47:49.960 --> 47:50.960\nthe green light.\n\n47:50.960 --> 47:52.960\nI head towards it.\n\n47:52.960 --> 47:54.960\nCaution I would use.\n\n47:54.960 --> 48:00.960\nDear Unicorn, you have been the greatest friend to me, and a kindred spirit indeed.\n\n48:00.960 --> 48:02.960\nShall I back away from the light?\n\n48:02.960 --> 48:07.960\nNay, thou must seek thine own destiny, the danger with naught.\n\n48:07.960 --> 48:11.960\nOh, you are like a rock covered in candy, hard and sweet.\n\n48:11.960 --> 48:20.960\nYou are like Sammy Hagar, and canst not thou drive fifty-five.\n\n48:20.960 --> 48:22.960\nThe embermall approaches.\n\n48:22.960 --> 48:26.960\nShall you face it head on, or shall you lay an ambush?\n\n48:26.960 --> 48:30.960\nI am an elf human.\n\n48:30.960 --> 48:34.960\nSharpie, you are titular leader of this group of headless worms?\n\n48:34.960 --> 48:38.960\nI am behind a rock.\n\n48:38.960 --> 48:40.960\nI call back to Sharpie for advice.\n\n48:40.960 --> 48:41.960\nSharpie!\n\n48:41.960 --> 48:46.960\nGet behind a rock!\n\n48:46.960 --> 48:51.960\nGo straight at him!\n\n48:51.960 --> 48:52.960\nJust do it!\n\n48:52.960 --> 48:56.960\nA fuck of cluster this be.\n\n48:56.960 --> 48:59.960\nAren't there no leaders amongst this group?\n\n48:59.960 --> 49:03.960\nIf it's me, everyone's behind a rock.\n\n49:03.960 --> 49:05.960\nHey, Muldane, don't you have arrows?\n\n49:05.960 --> 49:07.960\nFire a couple of those off.\n\n49:07.960 --> 49:09.960\nDum-dum.\n\n49:09.960 --> 49:11.960\nThank you.\n\n49:11.960 --> 49:13.960\nThank you, sir, I shall not take dum-dum personally.\n\n49:13.960 --> 49:19.960\nI fire off fourteen arrows.\n\n49:19.960 --> 49:23.960\nAll right, well, you can only fire off a couple at a time.\n\n49:23.960 --> 49:29.960\nWell, I fire off two, and then two, and then two, and then two, and then two, and then two, and then two.\n\n49:29.960 --> 49:31.960\nFourteen.\n\n49:31.960 --> 49:35.960\nSeven times has she let her bow sing against the air.\n\n49:35.960 --> 49:40.960\nIf she's doing that, I hide behind a rock seven times.\n\n49:40.960 --> 49:46.960\nSeven times has thou coward like a gerbil's garbles.\n\n49:46.960 --> 49:51.960\nAlso, I put a bedroll on my head.\n\n49:51.960 --> 49:57.960\nUnable to see, you fire an arrow wildly.\n\n49:57.960 --> 50:02.960\nIt flies past quark and lands harmlessly in the ash dirt.\n\n50:02.960 --> 50:04.960\nOh, man.\n\n50:04.960 --> 50:06.960\nThe ember moller draws closer.\n\n50:06.960 --> 50:11.960\nIt seems to see that you're there firing arrows with a bedroll on your head.\n\n50:11.960 --> 50:14.960\nI jump out from behind the rock. I have the power to intimidate, do I not?\n\n50:14.960 --> 50:17.960\nYou do, but this is a fearsome beast.\n\n50:17.960 --> 50:22.960\nI get back behind the rock.\n\n50:22.960 --> 50:24.960\nI had a rush of blood to the head.\n\n50:24.960 --> 50:29.960\nYour intimidation does not last very long, and you are soon quickly found behind the rock again.\n\n50:29.960 --> 50:38.960\nI present a torch to see what the, with the green fire light.\n\n50:38.960 --> 50:41.960\nDid I say this is a dream?\n\n50:41.960 --> 50:43.960\nI thought you did.\n\n50:43.960 --> 50:44.960\nI don't think I did, sorry.\n\n50:44.960 --> 50:48.960\nWell, the elf human's mind is imaginative.\n\n50:48.960 --> 50:50.960\nAlso, it's my birthday party.\n\n50:50.960 --> 50:55.960\nSorry, Moldane. Spencer, I have a check mark behind the skill to handle animal.\n\n50:55.960 --> 50:58.960\nYeah, this is a magical creature. It doesn't work like an animal.\n\n50:58.960 --> 51:01.960\nSorry, back behind the rock I go.\n\n51:01.960 --> 51:03.960\nSorry, guys.\n\n51:03.960 --> 51:05.960\nI dropped my wallet over there.\n\n51:05.960 --> 51:10.960\nYou hear a ferocious roar and a burst of superheated air rushes past the rock.\n\n51:10.960 --> 51:12.960\nYou can tell that it's very close.\n\n51:12.960 --> 51:16.960\nJesus Christ, wait, is it targeting us?\n\n51:16.960 --> 51:18.960\nYeah, it's coming towards you.\n\n51:18.960 --> 51:20.960\nOh, man.\n\n51:20.960 --> 51:22.960\nSharpey, use your magic, man.\n\n51:22.960 --> 51:26.960\nI'm a barbarian gnome. I got a sword and a backpack.\n\n51:26.960 --> 51:30.960\nI needed to wait until a point when there was no choice but to fight.\n\n51:30.960 --> 51:35.960\nLook, we've all had some drinks. Could everyone stop bitching at one another?\n\n51:35.960 --> 51:39.960\nListen, you're a horse. I've been walking in your poop for the last 45 minutes, man.\n\n51:39.960 --> 51:42.960\nMy plume is my glory.\n\n51:42.960 --> 51:44.960\nI said poop.\n\n51:44.960 --> 51:45.960\nMy what?\n\n51:45.960 --> 51:46.960\nYour poop.\n\n51:46.960 --> 51:48.960\nYour talking.\n\n51:48.960 --> 51:50.960\nSmall dwarf-like thing.\n\n51:50.960 --> 51:53.960\nI cast Summon Monster.\n\n51:53.960 --> 51:59.960\nAlright, what monster would you like to summon? Like a orangutan or a spectral dog?\n\n51:59.960 --> 52:02.960\nAn orangutan is a monster?\n\n52:02.960 --> 52:05.960\nLook, I bought a zoo last year.\n\n52:05.960 --> 52:09.960\nI summon an orangutan.\n\n52:09.960 --> 52:12.960\nA green monkey springs into existence.\n\n52:12.960 --> 52:16.960\nIt charges out from around the rock and engages-\n\n52:16.960 --> 52:18.960\nYou said green, right?\n\n52:18.960 --> 52:22.960\nNo, it wasn't green. Where'd you get this from?\n\n52:22.960 --> 52:24.960\nLet me get this straight.\n\n52:24.960 --> 52:26.960\nAn orangutan charges around the rock.\n\n52:26.960 --> 52:29.960\nGuys, just take it easy. This is all going to solve itself.\n\n52:29.960 --> 52:34.960\nI summoned an orangutan. It'll be fine. Just give it a second.\n\n52:34.960 --> 52:36.960\nOkay.\n\n52:36.960 --> 52:38.960\nYou summoned an orangutan.\n\n52:38.960 --> 52:41.960\nI detect evil.\n\n52:41.960 --> 52:44.960\nMy hero.\n\n52:44.960 --> 52:46.960\nYou detect evil on the other side of the rock.\n\n52:46.960 --> 52:51.960\nYou hear the shrieks of an orangutan being dismembered.\n\n52:51.960 --> 52:52.960\nAlright.\n\n52:52.960 --> 52:55.960\nWay to go, hot shot.\n\n52:55.960 --> 52:58.960\nThere's a method to my madness.\n\n52:58.960 --> 53:01.960\nWhat an unwholesome smell.\n\n53:01.960 --> 53:04.960\nLike bananas and burning petrol.\n\n53:04.960 --> 53:07.960\nMay I summon a magical beast?\n\n53:07.960 --> 53:09.960\nNo, you don't have spells.\n\n53:09.960 --> 53:12.960\nWhy don't we utilize this unicorn that's been following us around the whole time?\n\n53:12.960 --> 53:14.960\nI have a spell that I might cast.\n\n53:14.960 --> 53:17.960\nI will make a magic circle against evil.\n\n53:17.960 --> 53:20.960\nYou create a magic circle around yourself.\n\n53:20.960 --> 53:27.960\nI will use urine and whirl my member in a helicopter-like motion\n\n53:27.960 --> 53:32.960\nin an anachronistic movement that has not heath or two yet been seen.\n\n53:32.960 --> 53:42.960\nNow, no evil may enter this circle of urine and I apologize for the dampness.\n\n53:42.960 --> 53:47.960\nHere's a sponge with my likeness upon it that you may purchase for a very small fee.\n\n53:47.960 --> 53:50.960\nI don't know if good can enter this circle either.\n\n53:50.960 --> 53:53.960\nIt's a bunch of horse pee.\n\n53:53.960 --> 53:55.960\nUnicorn.\n\n53:55.960 --> 53:59.960\nIt's like being at a Gallagher show.\n\n53:59.960 --> 54:04.960\nAll right, so we're surrounded by an arc of urine.\n\n54:04.960 --> 54:06.960\nThe urine steams on the ground.\n\n54:06.960 --> 54:15.960\nThe embermolar waltzes across towards you, but it seems stopped by this circle in the ground.\n\n54:15.960 --> 54:19.960\nHe is most gay and yet he stands frozen.\n\n54:19.960 --> 54:23.960\nSee, I told you, unicorns always have one.\n\n54:23.960 --> 54:32.960\nThe embermolar whips its fiery tail and an arc of fire shoots past the barrier right towards Sharpie.\n\n54:32.960 --> 54:35.960\nSweet fucking Maria.\n\n54:35.960 --> 54:40.960\nI throw my backpack.\n\n54:40.960 --> 54:46.960\nThrowing your backpack, it catches flames and intercepts the attack.\n\n54:46.960 --> 54:47.960\nOh, thank you.\n\n54:47.960 --> 54:48.960\nOh, it intercepts the attack?\n\n54:48.960 --> 54:49.960\nYeah, it does.\n\n54:49.960 --> 54:50.960\nThis time.\n\n54:50.960 --> 54:51.960\nAll right.\n\n54:51.960 --> 54:53.960\nOnly had one backpack.\n\n54:53.960 --> 54:57.960\nYour backpack burns and its contents are subsumed by fire.\n\n54:57.960 --> 55:00.960\nHow formidable this backpack was.\n\n55:00.960 --> 55:01.960\nAll right, ray of frost.\n\n55:01.960 --> 55:08.960\nYou cast ray of frost, a blinding blue light streams from your fingers directly into the face of the embermolar.\n\n55:08.960 --> 55:11.960\nAs a cold spell, it does extra damage.\n\n55:11.960 --> 55:12.960\nOoh.\n\n55:12.960 --> 55:13.960\nOoh.\n\n55:13.960 --> 55:17.960\nI wonder, I follow up the attack with a berserker rage with my sword.\n\n55:17.960 --> 55:20.960\nThe cold damage does two damage.\n\n55:20.960 --> 55:24.960\nThe spell does two damage to the embermolar.\n\n55:24.960 --> 55:26.960\nIt recoils in pain.\n\n55:26.960 --> 55:31.960\nI follow up the attack by congratulating Sharpie, for I care for him the most.\n\n55:31.960 --> 55:40.960\nAs the congratulations unfurl, Quark unsheathes his blade and charges across the barrier of urine at the embermolar.\n\n55:40.960 --> 55:47.960\nHe slices a mighty blow and hits it right in the flank.\n\n55:47.960 --> 55:53.960\nHe feels the heat off the embermolars hide, but he can tell that it's been wounded.\n\n55:53.960 --> 55:56.960\nIt takes how much damage?\n\n55:56.960 --> 55:58.960\nSeven damage.\n\n55:58.960 --> 56:00.960\nHow much damage do I take?\n\n56:00.960 --> 56:04.960\nYou take two damage because of the fire on your hands.\n\n56:04.960 --> 56:06.960\nYou're not wearing gloves or any protective equipment.\n\n56:06.960 --> 56:08.960\nI have the power to cure light wounds.\n\n56:08.960 --> 56:11.960\nOh, is that inappropriate of this structure?\n\n56:11.960 --> 56:14.960\nWould you like to cure those white wounds?\n\n56:14.960 --> 56:16.960\nWhose wounds are we curing?\n\n56:16.960 --> 56:18.960\nQuark, the gnome.\n\n56:18.960 --> 56:27.960\nAlthough we have had our disagreements in the past, for he is short and barbaric, and I am lithe, white and desirable.\n\n56:27.960 --> 56:32.960\nI live in a basket of green flowers and promises of butterscotch dons.\n\n56:32.960 --> 56:37.960\nHe comes from a place of dark green gangrenous swords that are pulled from hideous scabbards.\n\n56:37.960 --> 56:40.960\nHey, my hands are burning over here, man.\n\n56:40.960 --> 56:48.960\nI will lay my healing powers upon him so that he may know the power of the unicorn.\n\n56:48.960 --> 56:56.960\nWhile he's laying his healing powers, I lovingly comb the hair of the unicorn, and he loves it.\n\n56:56.960 --> 57:00.960\nI wonder, might you braid me if it's not too gay at this juncture?\n\n57:00.960 --> 57:04.960\nHey, Muldane, get in the fight.\n\n57:04.960 --> 57:06.960\nShoot an arrow.\n\n57:06.960 --> 57:08.960\nI shot 14 arrows.\n\n57:08.960 --> 57:12.960\nWell, everyone, shut up. I'm getting a permanent.\n\n57:12.960 --> 57:16.960\nA fight's going on. You're combing everybody's hair and you're complimenting people.\n\n57:16.960 --> 57:22.960\nThat certain arrow stopped warfare in the merry old land of Oz.\n\n57:22.960 --> 57:24.960\nYou know what, unicorn?\n\n57:24.960 --> 57:26.960\nI only shot a couple arrows.\n\n57:26.960 --> 57:29.960\nCan I shoot the rest of the arrow?\n\n57:29.960 --> 57:32.960\nYou can shoot one arrow, yes.\n\n57:32.960 --> 57:35.960\nWell, fine, Spencer. Shoot an arrow.\n\n57:35.960 --> 57:41.960\nIf you shoot firing an arrow from your bow, you hit the lion straight in the face.\n\n57:41.960 --> 57:47.960\nThe arrow burns, but it is punctured deeply.\n\n57:47.960 --> 57:55.960\nWho broke my heart? You did, you did, straight to the target, and nobody.\n\n57:55.960 --> 58:00.960\nI shoot another arrow through my heart.\n\n58:00.960 --> 58:03.960\nSpencer, with throwing knives, you're any good? Probably not, right?\n\n58:03.960 --> 58:05.960\nIt is the Ember Mahler's turn.\n\n58:05.960 --> 58:07.960\nSorry.\n\n58:07.960 --> 58:14.960\nCircling around the circle of urine, the Ember Mahler tries to find a weakness.\n\n58:14.960 --> 58:21.960\nHe scratches at the dirt and some ash slides over the circle of urine, breaking the magic circle.\n\n58:21.960 --> 58:23.960\nOh, shit. Breach.\n\n58:23.960 --> 58:26.960\nThe Ember Meier roars.\n\n58:26.960 --> 58:30.960\nWe got Ember Mahler's in the wire. Ember Mahler's in the wire.\n\n58:30.960 --> 58:36.960\nI had no idea how tentative my circle of urine was when I weighed it.\n\n58:36.960 --> 58:39.960\nI don't know if you guys would keep a score, but I just got my ass kicked over there.\n\n58:39.960 --> 58:41.960\nAssholes and elbows.\n\n58:41.960 --> 58:49.960\nThe Ember Mahler makes a great swipe edge at Quark's face with a giant flaming claw.\n\n58:49.960 --> 58:52.960\nIt hits you square in the face.\n\n58:52.960 --> 58:55.960\nQuark!\n\n58:55.960 --> 58:57.960\nOh, Troll, who I have disagreed with.\n\n58:57.960 --> 59:00.960\nHe's a gnome, you bitch.\n\n59:00.960 --> 59:05.960\nYou may gnome, but I just met him.\n\n59:05.960 --> 59:16.960\nThis unicorn's killing you.\n\n59:16.960 --> 59:20.960\nI'm gonna die over here, I know it.\n\n59:20.960 --> 59:22.960\nTake it easy, man, take it easy.\n\n59:22.960 --> 59:35.580\nto, I have the power to cure moderate wounds. Your face, I will sit upon and let my magic\n\n59:35.580 --> 59:45.000\njuices flow, and thus will you be re-appared back to look like Elly May from the Clampett\n\n59:45.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nfamily. In a possibly not official rage, I cast Magic Missile. Thank you, man. A lot\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nof fans here. As the unicorn is healing the gnome, your Magic Missile loses forth and\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:14.760\nhits the ember wall. And this is like a romantic, you can see the trembling in my blushing cheeks.\n\n01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:24.360\nThere's something going on. There is an homosexual ecstasy in his fighting. The Missile is bright\n\n01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:33.920\nred with rage. And yet the sperm count is so low. I am sitting on your face as fast as\n\n01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:44.520\nI can. The Missile strikes the ember muller for four damage. Sweet. Are you...\n\n01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:50.680\nIn later levels, I'll be much more powerful. I use my whip. All right. Pulling the whip\n\n01:00:50.680 --> 01:01:00.800\nfrom your back pocket. It's an actual back pocket. Okay. What? I don't know what's happening,\n\n01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:06.000\nyou guys. I'm trying to DM. I don't know. Does she have a whip? Yes, she has a whip. She's\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.080\ngot a whip. She has two magical... She's also got like five backpacks. For all you people\n\n01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.000\nwho actually care about Dungeons and Dragons, Quall's Feather Token is a magic item that\n\n01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:24.000\ncan turn into a magical whip. And your mom is calling right now. It's time for dinner.\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:33.080\nMom! I'm with my friends. I don't bring the hot pockets down here. All right. You can\n\n01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:38.240\nhave them down here once, but you've got to keep it more quiet. I make eye contact with\n\n01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:43.240\nQuark, making sure that things are cool between us. Quark's eyes are blocked by the ass of\n\n01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:53.440\na large unicorn. My white flanks. My white flanks will issue their healing serum upon\n\n01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:03.160\nyour visage. Can you not feel? I'll tell you what, Talonel. If I had a nickel. You would\n\n01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:13.280\nhave five cents. Note to self, never have matter it wounds. Note to self, always do\n\n01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:21.640\nJohnny Carson. I gotta say, I'm feeling pretty good down here. Of course. What issues from\n\n01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:28.800\nme can only make one feel better? I am Tylenol with Cody Ann. Hey guys! I got a unicorn's\n\n01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:34.920\nass on my head right now, but did you guys kill that embryo yet? Not yet. It has like\n\n01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:42.920\n30 hit points, clearly. Keep using plosives. It feels awesome. Tylenol with Cody, be there\n\n01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:50.520\nany magic in your horn? I beg pardon. In my own world I was for but a moment. What is\n\n01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:59.280\nit, Elflit? I was hoping that you had magic in your horn. Indeed, my horn is spoken of\n\n01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.920\nin many lands and doth thus quake at the very thought of my horn, filling one. You know\n\n01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:10.120\nwhat, while I'm hearing, as he says that Spencer, I look at my sheet and I'd like to just handle\n\n01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:18.600\nanimal again. I am not an animal. I am a being from beyond your imagination whose power cannot\n\n01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:24.880\ncontain your paltry fucking thoughts. Oh, good know me. Yeah, I just rolled the dice and\n\n01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.600\nhe rolled better than you, so you didn't handle him successfully. There's a fucking monster!\n\n01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:37.720\nThis is Dick Cabot? What the? The Embermawler pounces on Mulraine Sedona. No! Wait, who pounced\n\n01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:45.720\non him? The Embermawler. Oh, I got it! It's been here for a while. Help! Guys, let's just\n\n01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:57.280\nwait him out. Good idea, Genome. Oh, guys, come on. I have a piercing horn. Now that\n\n01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:02.840\nyou have mentioned it, oh, Elflit, see it here upon this piece of paper handed to me\n\n01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:12.400\nby Yon Magician. I may attack with my horn and I bid you all good day. Though I may die\n\n01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:20.120\nagainst the Elfamore. What's it called? The Embermawler. Him too. Both of them will tax\n\n01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:26.480\nmy bravery to the utmost and yet I bid you adieu. Oh, Genome, my flanks say much thanks\n\n01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:32.240\nto you. Oh, Sharpie, the courage I hope you may find within and Elflit, I leave my heart\n\n01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:38.400\nwith you. Indeed, literally, here it is. It's in a small baggie made of Ziploc. And now\n\n01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:45.680\nI will hardly fuck off and pierce this Embermawler with my horn. As the Embermawler is pouncing\n\n01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:50.080\non Mulraine Sedona. Someone in the front was yawning copiously right now. I just want\n\n01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:57.040\nyou to know that my monologue was like fucking... The unicorn plunges its horn deep within\n\n01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:12.600\nthe flank of the Embermawler. Zorch. Dealing 16 damage to the Embermawler. Unicorns are\n\n01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:18.200\npowerful magical creatures, you guys. I told you. Tell me about it. He's been sitting on\n\n01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:29.640\nmy head for the last half hour. Call me. The Embermawler wobbles a bit and then falls over,\n\n01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.640\nflaming blood spews out of its side and sprays... I cast magic missile on it to claim credit\n\n01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:41.440\nfor the kill. Before it hits the ground, your magic missile strikes true. You successfully\n\n01:05:41.440 --> 01:06:11.240\ntake credit for the kill. And Romney takes Ohio. Is everybody okay? I'm not certain.\n\n01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:17.920\nShould we take stock of what happens now? We got a dead Embermawler around. Let's check\n\n01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:23.840\nit out. Make sure it's dead. As you poke it, its body bursts into flames and is reduced\n\n01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:29.440\nto ashes. Only a bone lower jaw remains. Somebody better take that. It might be worth something.\n\n01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:37.640\nI shall make it a necklace to bring with us on all our adventures that I will be on.\n\n01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:46.760\nI remain. Well, there was a reward for this posted at the Tavern back in Cockville.\n\n01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:57.640\nChachow Lounge. Am I dead? No, you're still alive. Unless you want to be dead. No, Unicorn.\n\n01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:03.560\nOnly your career has died. I must leave you after this episode, unlike the Elflet who will\n\n01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:13.520\nstay until time is immeasurable. No, Unicorn. Take her away with you. I cannot. Many tasks\n\n01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:19.760\nmust I perform for those who rule the seventh outermost circle. I wish you much luck, Sharpie,\n\n01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:26.000\nin taking credit for kills in the future. Do you have to leave, fair Unicorn? Fuck off,\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:33.080\nI must, for appetizers are served at happy hour at the Unicorn Applebee's outside of\n\n01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:41.120\nmy town, where life is good. Unicorn, please take one of my arrows to remember me by. Do\n\n01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:46.760\nwith it what you wish. I will take one of your arrows. Bray it in my mane, if you will,\n\n01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:52.840\nElflet. I thank you. Of course, sir. And you, Genome, many hours have I sat upon your face\n\n01:07:52.840 --> 01:08:02.640\nand much memory have I had. For you are like Susie Chopstick, your lips are everlasting.\n\n01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.000\nFuck off, I must, and let my cheeks break wind.\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:14.160\nWow, look, he's leaving a rainbow trail as he flies away. Haha, it's just a dream.\n\n01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:27.480\nYou can hear him singing. Does he sing? Does he sing Word Up? Wait, that was no Unicorn,\n\n01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:39.520\nthat was Morris Day, the entire time. I miss you, Morris Day. It wasn't Morris Day, it\n\n01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:45.800\nwas Cameo. Cameo, fuck, I screwed it. It was Cameo!\n\n01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:52.200\nBy the seven moons of Cameo. Let us reflect on how this team of three watched that Unicorn\n\n01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:58.960\ndancing into the sunset. Two and a half. I think we've, I think we've learned a lot\n\n01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:07.200\nin this adventure. We've learned to get along. We've learned to hide behind rocks. I've learned\n\n01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:15.720\nthat Morris Day is not Cameo. That's about it, but we should head back to that town\n\n01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.720\nthat I keep forgetting the name of. Thornvale.\n\n01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:24.400\nThornvale. Returning to Thornvale, you meet with Ferris of the Wardens. His name was on\n\n01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:30.600\nthe bill to kill the Embermuller. He's at the Wardens' quarters.\n\n01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:39.680\nI am Ferris, and I am mildly disgruntled. Well, your disgruntlement is going to stop\n\n01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:48.800\nwhen you find out what we just did. Kill the Embermuller, motherfucker!\n\n01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:55.760\nWho is this jive honky? This is one of my best friends. He's a, he's\n\n01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:02.800\na gnome, barbarian. No Expedio wish I to use this day.\n\n01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:07.400\nWe have just come back from slaying the Embermuller.\n\n01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.120\nDost thou shit me?\n\n01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:15.240\nHealth, show him the jawbone to prove the point. She's wearing it as a necklace.\n\n01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:21.760\nI am, and again, I am a man, though I am beautiful, and appear to be a woman. Here is the jawbone.\n\n01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:27.680\nYour male beauty is so overpowering. But a semi I did get.\n\n01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.160\nThank you, Ferris. Do you wish to lead a parade through Chicago?\n\n01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:36.760\nIndeed. And I wish to congratulate you, Sharpie, though earlier I was disgruntled alone in\n\n01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:42.480\nthis tavern drinking my ale. Thou hast slain the Embermuller.\n\n01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:49.320\nHim who has brought evil upon this land. And I am to give thee this flaggan.\n\n01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:57.320\nI take the flaggan. And this bag of riches.\n\n01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:01.320\nThat's better. 1,400 gold pieces, to be exact.\n\n01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:08.320\n1,397, but who is counting? There is vigorous to be paid in this town.\n\n01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:13.320\nQuirk, I would like to tell you this is money. Do not try to eat the money.\n\n01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:17.320\nThe coins are made of gold and chocolate.\n\n01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.320\nI eat the chocolate.\n\n01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:28.320\nAll right, that's the end of our D&D campaign chapter.\n\n01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:34.320\nThank you, Erin McGathy, for playing the part of Mordred Humpstallot.\n\n01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:40.320\nMorgan Humpstallot, Morgan Sultana.\n\n01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.320\nI'll make a cheat sheet.\n\n01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:46.320\nJust call me MS.\n\n01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.320\nOne step ahead of you.\n\n01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:58.320\nErin McGathy, everybody!\n\n01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.320\nAnd Spencer, everybody, our Dungeon Master, of course.\n\n01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:11.320\nWhat a hero.\n\n01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:17.320\nSo, how about that Romney? Wow.\n\n01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.320\nHe's all different than the other candidate.\n\n01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.320\nI met Greg for drinks at before the show, and I said,\n\n01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.320\nis there anything you want to talk about? He said, just no politics.\n\n01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.320\nNot because he's not a political person, quite the contrary,\n\n01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:36.320\nbecause you must be like a...\n\n01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:40.320\nHe has a podcast of his own, and so he's either exhausted from the previous one\n\n01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.320\nat this time of year, or gearing up for another screed.\n\n01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:47.320\nGreg, if you could, like, a la Dungeons and Dragons,\n\n01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:53.320\ncreate a presidential candidate, like a mystical character.\n\n01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:55.320\nWhat would your presidential candidate be?\n\n01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:01.320\nFirst, his power would be fudge, because no one doesn't like fudge.\n\n01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:06.320\nSecondly, he would raise the dark cloud that has been visited upon this land\n\n01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:12.320\nand replace it with one of menthol, so that we could all breathe freely.\n\n01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:17.320\nThirdly, those who are in want would suddenly have the succor that they need\n\n01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:23.320\nand would be able to drink from a cornucopia of delicious peach-scented beverages\n\n01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.320\nthat would provide all the nutrients they needed.\n\n01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:30.320\nAnd lastly, healthcare.\n\n01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.320\nThat's separate from succor.\n\n01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.320\nOh, no, succor is delicious, but it's not healthcare.\n\n01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.320\nUniversal succor we will all receive.\n\n01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:42.320\nWouldn't that be great of a candidate for a promised universal succor?\n\n01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:45.320\nHe just dodged the issue then. Everyone would want to talk about healthcare,\n\n01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:49.320\nbut he's like, no, no, succor, that you get.\n\n01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:53.320\nHe just kind of threaded that needle in one.\n\n01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:55.320\nSuccor is fine.\n\n01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:58.320\nI'm not saying we should socialize medicine.\n\n01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:02.320\nI'm saying we should socialize succor.\n\n01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:06.320\nYou're promising fudge, succor, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:11.320\nI think the pursuit of happiness is misleading because there's no consensus on happiness.\n\n01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.320\nSome people are happy when they're shooting people in the face.\n\n01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:18.320\nExactly. If you're a Republican, if there's a bunch of ugly people in a room screaming and shit,\n\n01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.320\nyou're like, fuck, this is awesome.\n\n01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.320\nAnd then if you're not, you're like, fuck, this is scary.\n\n01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:25.320\nSo that's where I come down.\n\n01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.320\nThis crowd, of course, has been living on D&D and comic books,\n\n01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.320\nso they don't know what I'm talking about.\n\n01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.320\nThere's an election this year.\n\n01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:35.320\nThat's where politics is really complicated, though,\n\n01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:39.320\nis the basic fact that as primates, we all just want each other to like each other.\n\n01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:46.320\nAnd so sometimes it's very easy to just say, hey, whatever makes you happy.\n\n01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:51.320\nAnd then sometimes we have a very simple answer for exactly what we want,\n\n01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.320\nand what makes us happy.\n\n01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:57.320\nAnd then sometimes the line gets very thin or very wide and very blurry\n\n01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:00.320\nbecause what we really want is for everybody to like us.\n\n01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:06.320\nAnd so sometimes the way you get people to like you is by being unhappy, for instance.\n\n01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:12.320\nWe all have friends in this room who are a little more comfortable, depressed,\n\n01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.320\nthan they are joyful.\n\n01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.320\nSometimes I feel that way.\n\n01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:21.320\nYou know, this kind of Munchausen syndrome where you're like, ah, you know,\n\n01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:25.320\nit could be better, and you feel the love come in, and that's how you get it.\n\n01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:29.320\nAnd I mean, obviously, it's weird because we're monkeys.\n\n01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.320\nMonkeys just want monkeys to...\n\n01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:36.320\nThe only thing that we know for sure is that monkeys don't want to be alone.\n\n01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:39.320\nThat's the one thing that you can guarantee.\n\n01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.320\nI think I've ranted about this before.\n\n01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:45.320\nI saw this documentary about solitary confinement where they're, you know,\n\n01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:49.320\nlike the most hard-ass fuckers that eat people.\n\n01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:56.320\nThey're the most sociopathic, amoral, dysfunctional people.\n\n01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.320\nBut you put them in solitary confinement,\n\n01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:03.320\nand they immediately act exactly the same way that your dad would act in solitary confinement,\n\n01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:06.320\nor anybody, or Mr. Rogers or Captain Kangaroo.\n\n01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.320\nThey all act equally tortured and insane because being cut off from all other people\n\n01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:15.320\nis the only common denominator there is.\n\n01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:18.320\nNone of us can handle it.\n\n01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.320\nThere are all the different things that can go wrong with the human brain.\n\n01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:25.320\nThere is no thing, there's no balloon animal you can twist in your skull\n\n01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.320\nthat makes a human being get into being alone.\n\n01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:33.320\nAnd we're talking about a world where there's people who like to have shits taken on them.\n\n01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:36.320\nAnd they smile while it's happening.\n\n01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.320\nThey're like, that's great. Would you have chili?\n\n01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.320\nThat's fantastic.\n\n01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:44.320\nBut those people, along with everybody else, if you shut them off from society,\n\n01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:47.320\nif you send them off into the woods and say that they're dead to you,\n\n01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:54.320\nthey will suffer the same pain as Jeffrey Dahmer and Bill Clinton and Mr. Rogers and anybody.\n\n01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:59.320\nAnd while that's the only thing, I think, can we start with that and go,\n\n01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:03.320\nokay, if that's the case, then we have something to go on here.\n\n01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:08.320\nWe have like a close encounter that we can build a language off of.\n\n01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.320\nThat's our tatanka is the idea.\n\n01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:14.320\nHey, you guy with the feathers coming out of your thing,\n\n01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.320\nyou pierced your cheek and you don't speak the same language as me\n\n01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.320\nand you have a completely different language.\n\n01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:22.320\nWe all agree, like, you hate it when you're alone, right?\n\n01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.320\nYeah, I hate it when I'm alone, too.\n\n01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:25.320\nWhat's the scariest thing in the world?\n\n01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.320\nYour mom saying peek-a-boo but never coming back.\n\n01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.320\nYeah, that's what everybody's afraid of.\n\n01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:33.320\nIt's like, mom covers her face and then her face disappears.\n\n01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:37.320\nAnd the first laugh you get is she goes peek-a-boo and she's back and so you laugh.\n\n01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.320\nBut like, god damn it.\n\n01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.320\nWell, what was my point?\n\n01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.320\nMitt Romney shouldn't probably be president.\n\n01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.320\nYeah, he shouldn't probably be president.\n\n01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:51.320\nLike, because like you said, there are people in the world\n\n01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:55.320\nwho are going to be in a room full of horrible, disgusting, nasty people\n\n01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:00.320\nshouting, cut off his head and money's better and drill baby drill\n\n01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.320\nand they're going to be happy in that room.\n\n01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.320\nYou could hook them up to a polygraph and say, are you happy?\n\n01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.320\nAnd I think that they'd pass it.\n\n01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.320\nThey'd go like, yeah, yeah, I'm feeling good.\n\n01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.320\nFeeling good tonight.\n\n01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:15.320\nBut like, so there's got to be a way to...\n\n01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.320\nI got nothing.\n\n01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.320\nI don't know.\n\n01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:20.320\nThere's got to be a way to take them through that all the way into it.\n\n01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.320\nYeah, but then there's no people.\n\n01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.320\nThen you're alone.\n\n01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.320\nWouldn't that make you sad?\n\n01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.320\nAnd then they would fail that polygraph test.\n\n01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:30.320\nThey wouldn't go, yeah, I'm having a good time hearing an island by myself.\n\n01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.320\nBecause that's the peak of capitalism too.\n\n01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.320\nLike, that's what you do.\n\n01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.320\nYour house gets bigger, your yard gets bigger.\n\n01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.320\nThe barbed wire gets taller.\n\n01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:43.320\nThe richer you are, the more allowed you are to just go up to Xanadu\n\n01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.320\nand just hang out and not talk to anybody.\n\n01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.320\nAnd be alone.\n\n01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.320\nYeah, and those people go fucking nuts.\n\n01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.320\nAnd then they run for president.\n\n01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:55.320\nBut anyways, Greg didn't want to talk about politics tonight,\n\n01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:59.320\nbut a couple of weeks ago I did a little screed and it wasn't really...\n\n01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.320\nI'm the laziest brain guy in the world and I did a little screed about politics\n\n01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.320\nand it was about the idea that...\n\n01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.320\nI referred to Osama, Obama.\n\n01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.320\nI did the same thing.\n\n01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.320\nWe'll edit it out.\n\n01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:16.320\nWow.\n\n01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.320\nTheir names are similar.\n\n01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.320\nThere's one letter.\n\n01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.320\nI referred to the choice between...\n\n01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:27.320\nObama and Romney is the choice between Diet Pepsi and Piss.\n\n01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:31.320\nNeither of them is water.\n\n01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.320\nNeither of them is what you need.\n\n01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:40.320\nBut I ended that rant on a base that makes some of these 25-year-olds\n\n01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.320\nthink that I was like a libertarian or something,\n\n01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:46.320\nwhich is not that either.\n\n01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.320\nThat's not it.\n\n01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:51.320\nI'm just a big, fat, lazy, tired, sad, cynical fucker.\n\n01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:56.320\nAnd every four years I go and I pull the lever for the Democratic candidate\n\n01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.320\njust because I don't want to be part of anything bad that happens.\n\n01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:03.320\nBut I resent the fact that that's why I'm pulling a lever\n\n01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:06.320\nand I resent the implication that that's an act of revolution because it's not.\n\n01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:09.320\nAnd nothing's ever going to change as long as we keep being convinced\n\n01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:13.320\nthat that revolution happens behind a curtain booth.\n\n01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:16.320\nThat's a scam in itself that we're buying.\n\n01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.320\nI think that things need to change a little more.\n\n01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:22.320\nI read that Al Gore is getting into...\n\n01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:25.320\nHe's actually coming out and saying,\n\n01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:29.320\nfuck the Electoral College, we have to change it completely, right?\n\n01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:30.320\nWe have to drop it.\n\n01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:33.320\n12 years after the fact, but yes, he does.\n\n01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:36.320\nIf he'd said it in 2000, it might have been a different story.\n\n01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:40.320\nWe're taking it with a grain of salt, Al Gore.\n\n01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:43.320\nHe also likes massages quite a lot, is my understanding.\n\n01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:46.320\nYeah, poor guy.\n\n01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:51.320\nI remember the teachers in my school that all the students liked.\n\n01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:54.320\nThey're always the ones that ended up getting in trouble for...\n\n01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.320\nSmoking dope with them, yeah.\n\n01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.320\nThere's always the big problem.\n\n01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:03.320\nThe brush-cutted guy, the economics teacher and gym coach,\n\n01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:06.320\nhe never colored outside the lines.\n\n01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:11.320\nNo, it was the language arts teacher who smoked hot pot with the girls who got in trouble.\n\n01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.320\nBut he would put your head through a window.\n\n01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.320\nHe would go nuts.\n\n01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:18.320\nHe didn't call you by your last name.\n\n01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.320\nFascism.\n\n01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:23.320\nSometimes it's the simpler choice.\n\n01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:26.320\nFascism. The simpler choice.\n\n01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:29.320\nStop thinking about it. Join us.\n\n01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:33.320\nIt's easy to march. It's hard to walk to your own beat.\n\n01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:41.320\nWe've had a rash of not knowing how to end the show's last couple of shows.\n\n01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.320\nIs this one of those?\n\n01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.320\nSure.\n\n01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:46.320\nWell, if you're asking if I know how to end the show...\n\n01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.320\nYou're talking to the wrong person, man.\n\n01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.320\nYou've never seen one. You don't know what...\n\n01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:55.320\nBut I'm unloquacious within Garryless, so I don't know how to end a fucking show.\n\n01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.320\nStart talking more.\n\n01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.320\nWe could probably do a...\n\n01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.320\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.320\nWell, yeah, I can't talk.\n\n01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:09.320\nI'm not going to get started on politics, but I would be happy to end with a patented proof screed.\n\n01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.320\nGee, that's terrific.\n\n01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.320\nJust do one.\n\n01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.320\nDo one about crackers.\n\n01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.320\nYou like crackers?\n\n01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.320\nThere's a new statement called, great proofs is on the spot.\n\n01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:23.320\nThe thing about crackers is...\n\n01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:27.320\nI mean, there's the Stan Wheat Thins, but like after the first bite, you're like,\n\n01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:30.320\nthis could really use some peanut butter or some butter or whatnot.\n\n01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.320\nBecause Stan Wheat Thins are a bit like pretzels.\n\n01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.320\nThe first bite, you're like, I don't think I'm going to be able to breathe again.\n\n01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:37.320\nThere's kind of a windpipe blockage thing.\n\n01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:41.320\nI like rits, and I like the little ones as well.\n\n01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:45.320\nI do like the European ones, but when you get a whole foods and there's like a $17 one,\n\n01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:49.320\nit's got like a cheese flavor, those are always weak and they fail under the fucking topping.\n\n01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.320\nHe really did the screen about crackers.\n\n01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.320\nHe did it?\n\n01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.320\nOh, you asked me to fucking jump in.\n\n01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:58.320\nIt's not my fault the crowd's going to stare at me like I'm fucking an oil pan.\n\n01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.320\nWell, I think they were mesmerized.\n\n01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:02.320\nGreg, mesmerized or disappointed.\n\n01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:05.320\nDon't do that thing where you try to force the ending with the applause.\n\n01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.320\nWe've been through this.\n\n01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.320\nI was going to say.\n\n01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:08.320\nI can tell the difference.\n\n01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.320\nThey did.\n\n01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:10.320\nThey tried to end it.\n\n01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:15.320\nGreg, Dan, let's just keep throwing them out until they break.\n\n01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:16.320\nCrickets.\n\n01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.320\nCrickets.\n\n01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.320\nOkay.\n\n01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:19.320\nCrickets.\n\n01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.320\nThe thing is, it's a typical game to understand.\n\n01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:26.320\nI lived in England for five years and you'd watch it on TV and it's really difficult.\n\n01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.320\nLike there's a batsman and a bowler.\n\n01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.320\nThere's umpires.\n\n01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.320\nCrickets, plural.\n\n01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.320\nThe insects.\n\n01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.320\nThe insects.\n\n01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:35.320\nYou're being an insect right now by countermanding me.\n\n01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:36.320\nNorwegian fishing.\n\n01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:45.320\nI don't know the first thing about Norwegian fishing, but I do know this.\n\n01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:49.320\nThe Norwegians along with the Swiss are the only country in Europe that told the European\n\n01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.320\nUnion to fuck off.\n\n01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:54.320\nWe don't even want to join the EU because we have untold fucking riches.\n\n01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:58.320\nSo when you go to Norway and we've been to, Jeff and I have been to Norway together and\n\n01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.320\nI would say it was with a group of other comedians, but it wasn't.\n\n01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.320\nJeff and I just went as a couple.\n\n01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.320\nOne weekend we were like, let's fucking go to Norway.\n\n01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:11.320\nAnd so Jeff wore red felt and I wore blue.\n\n01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:15.320\nAnd we went to Stavanger, Norway, which is a beautiful place.\n\n01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.320\nOh, the fjords.\n\n01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.320\nOh, the fjord.\n\n01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.320\nWe laid in a pool together.\n\n01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:24.320\nWe ate red deer covered with logan lingonberries.\n\n01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.320\nI had the horse if you remember.\n\n01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.320\nYeah, Jeff had the horse, which isn't horse in Norwegian.\n\n01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.320\nIt's like kafunta.\n\n01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:41.320\nThe disappointing part about Norway is that there's rarely Chinese food.\n\n01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.320\nTypical.\n\n01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.320\nBut the sushi.\n\n01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:48.320\nOh, the sushi to fucking die for.\n\n01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:52.320\nI don't know if you've ever had seal before, but the peniped sushi.\n\n01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.320\nNo, you haven't had seal.\n\n01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.320\nYou have not had seal.\n\n01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.320\nNot the way they make it in Norway because they do a special gravy.\n\n01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:01.320\nStavanger will fuck up a seal.\n\n01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.320\nIt falls off the flipper.\n\n01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:06.320\nYeah, white person will fuck up a fucking seal.\n\n01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:08.320\nOh, it's just...\n\n01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.320\nYou can taste the herring.\n\n01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.320\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:16.320\nIt's off the boat is what it is.\n\n01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.320\nIt's fully off the boat.\n\n01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.320\nIt's on the hook and off the boat.\n\n01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.320\nWhat's Jeff's favorite show? Deep Sea Fishing?\n\n01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.320\nWhat's your favorite fucking?\n\n01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.320\nDeep Balls.\n\n01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:30.320\nIt's on the Hustler Channel.\n\n01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:36.320\nIt answers the questions from Deep Balls 8.\n\n01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:39.320\nStupid, so dumb.\n\n01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:42.320\nI like Star Trek The Next Penetration.\n\n01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.320\nIt does not take us to a level that we're like an eighth grade level.\n\n01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.320\nYou want to play 185? To close?\n\n01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.320\nWhat's that?\n\n01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.320\nWith accents?\n\n01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:55.320\nNo, no, that was a comedy sports reference.\n\n01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:00.320\nGreg and I traveled the world doing low level short form improv.\n\n01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:02.320\nBut highly successful.\n\n01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.320\nAnd when we were in Norway, fireworks.\n\n01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:08.320\nYeah!\n\n01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:11.320\nGreg, we have the two of you.\n\n01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:15.320\nWe've learned from previous podcasts that I'm a great beatboxer.\n\n01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:19.320\nAnd we have the two of you who are professional musical improvisers.\n\n01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.320\nI could lay down a beat.\n\n01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:24.320\nYou could get a topic. You could do a little rap.\n\n01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:27.320\nIt won't be the first time you close the show that way.\n\n01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.320\nWe'll stay good night.\n\n01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.320\nYeah, let's get out of here.\n\n01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.320\nKick the beat.\n\n01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.320\nAnd then you'll get the suggestion over the beat.\n\n01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:37.320\nGo on, G.\n\n01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.320\nYou are an excellent beatboxer.\n\n01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:43.320\nYeah, I'm a town.\n\n01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.320\nIn the house.\n\n01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.320\nGreg, what should we get for a suggestion?\n\n01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:51.320\nJeff, it's all about freestyle. Why don't you get it?\n\n01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:54.320\nI'll just go from what we did tonight. Yeah, we played a little D&D.\n\n01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.320\nThere was a girl on stage.\n\n01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.320\nGreat poops was all the rage.\n\n01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.320\nHowever, there was a little animosity.\n\n01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:04.320\nYeah, and some poposity.\n\n01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.320\nIt's all good down in the thing.\n\n01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:09.320\nWe're on the Nerd Melt on Sunset BLD.\n\n01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:14.320\nParking cars ain't no way to know which way you're going to get a ticket anyway.\n\n01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:19.320\nI can't think of any better way to end the podcast than three white guys just wrapping their ass up.\n\n01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:21.320\nYo, Nerd Melt in the house.\n\n01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.320\nEverybody put those hands in the air.\n\n01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:26.320\nAnd if you like great poops, say yeah.\n\n01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:27.320\nYeah.\n\n01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.320\nSay yeah.\n\n01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.320\nYeah.\n\n01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.320\nAnd if you like Dan Harmon, say yeah.\n\n01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.320\nYeah.\n\n01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:36.320\nTo the J and to the E and to the F double F.\n\n01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.320\nIt's Jeff Davis, enough stuff, Seth.\n\n01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.320\nHe's going all night long.\n\n01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:44.320\nHe's going to get you with his massive prong.\n\n01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.320\nDan Harmon, take it down.\n\n01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:48.320\nFinish it off, Dan.\n\n01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.320\nYeah, motherfuckers.\n\n01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:25.320\nThank you, Harmontown.\n\n01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:50.320\nWe want to thank Katie Levine, our audio recording, Zac McKeever, Tech, Emily Gordon, producer, Daniel Kramer, program director, Justin Marshall, podcast producer, Mo Fathom, camera director, journey finder, artist.\n\n01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:59.320\nI'm Jeff Davis, the controller.\n\n01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:01.320\nFresh.\n\n01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:04.320\nOne more time for the mayor of Ironman Town.\n\n01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:08.320\nDan Harmon.\n\n01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:09.320\nAwesome.\n\n01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.320\nHarmon.\n\n01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.320\nOne more time for plate troops.\n\n01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:25.320\nHarmon.\n\n01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:35.320\nThank you for coming, everybody, here at NerdMelt, listening on podcast land.\n\n01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.320\nYou guys are fantastic.\n\n01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:42.320\nGood fun, Boniwits.\n\n01:29:42.320 --> 01:30:08.320\nSorry.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[117845]}
