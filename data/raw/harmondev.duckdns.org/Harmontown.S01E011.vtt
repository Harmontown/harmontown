00:00.000 --> 00:19.520
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

00:19.520 --> 00:25.760
Harmontown is now officially in session.

00:25.760 --> 00:29.760
Thank you for coming down to Hollywood, California in the Nerdmelt Theater.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.520
And those of you listening out in podcast universe, thank you.

00:32.520 --> 00:37.520
Please join us all in welcoming the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:37.520 --> 00:46.560
All right, welcome.

00:46.560 --> 00:51.320
Welcome to my magical forest of microphones.

00:51.320 --> 00:55.680
I have tied a red ribbon around the one that has a pot of gold under it.

00:55.680 --> 00:59.680
Do you ever hear that leprechaun story, Jeff?

00:59.680 --> 01:02.840
Jeff, have you ever heard that old leprechaun story?

01:02.840 --> 01:06.760
There's not a single leprechaun story I haven't heard, Dan.

01:06.760 --> 01:12.280
The guy catches a leprechaun and he says, give me your pot of gold, which is what you're

01:12.280 --> 01:15.000
right if you catch a leprechaun.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.200
But the leprechaun can still fuck with you a little bit.

01:17.200 --> 01:20.560
He has, like, options left.

01:20.560 --> 01:25.640
And so this leprechaun says to the guy, okay, I'll give you that.

01:25.640 --> 01:27.360
Give you my pot of gold.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.200
Come to the forest tomorrow.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.680
It's under the tree with the red ribbon around it.

01:32.680 --> 01:35.920
And so, of course, maybe some of you see where this is going.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.000
But this is a golden age for leprechauns.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.440
People weren't that savvy yet.

01:40.440 --> 01:47.200
They hadn't watched enough CW shows and Grim hadn't aired yet.

01:47.200 --> 01:50.080
People were mythically deaf and blind.

01:50.080 --> 01:55.640
So he let the fucking leprechaun go based on that promise alone shows up a whole forest

01:55.640 --> 01:58.320
of trees with red ribbons around them.

01:58.320 --> 02:00.320
This is not a pot of gold you're going to get tonight.

02:00.320 --> 02:05.520
What you're going to get tonight is a podcast of gold.

02:05.520 --> 02:10.880
No, it wasn't a podcast of gold.

02:10.880 --> 02:15.400
Pot, no, it doesn't matter.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.400
Nothing matters.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.400
I'm in a good mood.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.400
I'm very excited.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.400
I'm nervous when I come up, I go, I don't know, I feel, as I've said before, bio-rhythmically,

02:22.400 --> 02:24.840
I feel like, well, I'm not witty tonight.

02:24.840 --> 02:25.840
I have nothing to say.

02:25.840 --> 02:26.840
I'm tongue-tied.

02:26.840 --> 02:34.920
My frontal lobe is a little fatigued, perhaps from some intricate sex game I played.

02:34.920 --> 02:39.960
But then sometimes I come up and I go, oh, man, I'm really going to slay people.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.160
I can't wait to get up.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.240
This is one of those nights it doesn't matter because we have Greg Proups coming up here.

02:44.240 --> 02:47.320
Greg Proups is here tonight.

02:47.320 --> 02:48.320
So who cares?

02:48.320 --> 02:49.320
It's really on him.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.320
Yeah.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.320
It's on him.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.400
It's just a Greg Proups show.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.840
If this show sucks, it's simply on his shoulders.

02:55.840 --> 02:56.840
Yeah.

02:56.840 --> 03:00.720
I'll sabotage it so I can walk away from those going, I don't see what the big deal of Greg

03:00.720 --> 03:01.720
Proups is.

03:01.720 --> 03:03.240
I had him on my show.

03:03.240 --> 03:07.680
It didn't turn into diamonds.

03:07.680 --> 03:14.640
But more so than that, he's a good friend of Jeff's and, therefore, by proxy, a much

03:14.640 --> 03:16.120
adored friend of mine.

03:16.120 --> 03:20.960
We went and saw his podcast in San Francisco in January, last January at Sketchfest.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.600
I was blown away.

03:22.600 --> 03:26.960
I think that's when I got the nuts up to, were we already doing this and recording it

03:26.960 --> 03:27.960
and podcasting it?

03:27.960 --> 03:28.960
No.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.120
No, we weren't.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.120
Just after.

03:31.120 --> 03:35.720
So he's actually kind of a bit of an unwitting Obi-Wan to this show, I think, because I

03:35.720 --> 03:39.240
sat there in a comedy club and watched Proups just babble into a microphone and, of course,

03:39.240 --> 03:42.360
I thought, well, then I'll do it.

03:42.360 --> 03:46.880
Then put it on iTunes and make people listen to it.

03:46.880 --> 03:55.760
But he's going to specifically come up primarily to play Dungeons and Dragons with us.

03:55.760 --> 04:00.080
We have Spencer, our Dungeon Master, sitting anxiously on deck.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.080
Yeah.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.080
Spencer is like a Brahmin bull.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.080
Is that a kind of?

04:05.080 --> 04:06.080
Brahma.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.080
Brahma bull.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.760
A Brahmin bull is more of like a Hindu kind of.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.080
A Brahmin bull is no big deal.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.080
They're very relaxed.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.080
Yeah.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.800
They're no danger at all.

04:15.800 --> 04:21.960
Health update.

04:21.960 --> 04:26.960
Last week, I explained that I had been having these light-headed spells and I've been hot

04:26.960 --> 04:29.640
on the trail on how to figure out what's wrong with them.

04:29.640 --> 04:34.200
Vitamin D deficiency epiphanies, magnesium epiphanies, potassium epiphanies.

04:34.200 --> 04:39.400
And then I told the story of how Aaron gave me the anxiety epiphany at the San Diego Zoo.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.880
Oh, it's just anxiety, as soon as I knew that, everything was fine.

04:42.880 --> 04:46.640
But then that very night of the podcast, it was like, still, I'm having these light-headed

04:46.640 --> 04:47.640
spells.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.160
I got to go back into the doctor.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.240
Even though I got all this blood work, what's wrong with me?

04:51.240 --> 04:52.240
What is it?

04:52.240 --> 04:53.680
There's nothing wrong with my lab results.

04:53.680 --> 04:57.120
I go back into the doctor, I tell him about these light-headed spells.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.360
And he diagnosed me.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.520
The bad news is I have respiratory alkalosis.

05:03.520 --> 05:07.440
And the good news is that's like the hiccups.

05:07.440 --> 05:12.440
And his prescription was literally to breathe less.

05:12.440 --> 05:16.320
Respiratory alkalosis is when you accidentally hyperventilate.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.600
And that's it.

05:18.600 --> 05:24.840
And it's a syndrome in the short term where if you're undergoing stress, good or bad,

05:24.840 --> 05:30.680
you kind of accidentally breathe just a hair too deeply, then you get a little light-headed.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.240
And then you go, I'm getting light-headed.

05:32.240 --> 05:37.320
And then so you go, you flood your body with oxygen because you want to clear your head.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.200
And then it gets worse and worse.

05:39.200 --> 05:43.240
And then the more it gets worse, and the one thing I hadn't tried, because it just doesn't

05:43.240 --> 05:47.760
seem like a good idea in those moments, is breathing less.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.160
And that's all I have to do.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.760
And I've tried it like seven times.

05:50.760 --> 05:55.080
I've had little things come on, and then I exhale like I have the hiccups, and then

05:55.080 --> 05:56.480
I just take shallow breaths.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.880
I felt like the biggest dick.

05:57.880 --> 06:01.680
Well, when you say breathing less, you mean inhale less?

06:01.680 --> 06:02.680
Yeah.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.040
Don't take a big breath and hold it.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.760
Just exhale and hold it.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.720
Which makes you feel like you're going to die, but then at the same time, it clears

06:08.720 --> 06:09.720
my head up.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.480
But doesn't that give you a stroke at some point?

06:11.480 --> 06:13.600
If you deoxygenate your brain?

06:13.600 --> 06:22.040
Well, no, not when you have too much oxygen in your blood, which is why you're feeling

06:22.040 --> 06:23.040
light-headed.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.120
It's fucking weird.

06:24.120 --> 06:28.400
Your body runs on this balance of gases, CO2 and O2.

06:28.400 --> 06:34.320
And if you have less CO2, even though CO2 is bad, it's not like we use it for anything,

06:34.320 --> 06:36.920
but if the balance is, I'm sure we use it for a lot.

06:36.920 --> 06:41.720
Don't write me any letters, you fucking CO2 heads.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.200
We use it for trees.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.840
Yeah, we give back to the earth.

06:46.840 --> 06:51.640
If it's slightly imbalanced, you have a regulator in your head that will eventually make you

06:51.640 --> 06:55.760
faint, and what fainting is, is just your body going, this guy can't breathe right

06:55.760 --> 07:01.400
on his own, and just knock him out, and I'll take it from here, and then regulates your

07:01.400 --> 07:02.400
breathing and you wake up.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.840
And I think that's why women fainted, you know, that whole fainting couch culture.

07:05.840 --> 07:10.160
They were wearing corsets and tying them really tight, so they were fucking with the balance

07:10.160 --> 07:14.520
of the gases in their bodies, so women were regularly fainting, and then the men who designed

07:14.520 --> 07:16.520
the corsets would say, well, you're hysterical.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.520
This is something that women do, they're psychos.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.520
Let's get that corset off right now.

07:21.520 --> 07:25.880
Oh, yeah, no, keep it on, but let's not let them vote.

07:25.880 --> 07:30.800
Okay, so, but I don't need to get political tonight, because we have Greg Proups here.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.800
It's on him, no.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.800
Were you bringing him up?

07:34.800 --> 07:36.800
No, no, no, no, I mean, I will now.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.480
I wanted to update you on my respiratory alkalosis.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.560
It's a new thing I'm going to blame for everything.

07:41.560 --> 07:42.560
Respiratory alkalosis.

07:42.560 --> 07:46.160
So to recap, bring up the, I like that it has alcohol in it.

07:46.160 --> 07:54.200
I know, no, believe me, he said, it's respiratory alkalosis, and I went, oh fuck, here it is.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.280
The glory days are gone.

07:56.280 --> 07:58.680
You have a cute, you have a cute vodcosis.

07:58.680 --> 08:02.000
Yeah, I was so excited that it was an alkaloid thing.

08:02.000 --> 08:09.760
I was like, yes, oh, oh, 10 more years, 10 more years.

08:09.760 --> 08:18.600
One of drinking and eight of not knowing what eight plus one is.

08:18.600 --> 08:24.320
That was a, that was a quotable, you just watched my brain die a little bit.

08:24.320 --> 08:29.240
I'm, I'm no scientist or a doctor, and I'm not bad at math and putting things together,

08:29.240 --> 08:31.480
but why don't you just wear a corset?

08:31.480 --> 08:33.480
That's a good idea.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.480
Stick a corset on.

08:34.480 --> 08:37.320
Well, I don't know if the corset makes more CO2 or less CO2.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.320
I don't know why women are paining.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.800
It makes it harder for you to inhale oxygen, so you're probably going to do-

08:41.800 --> 08:42.800
Too much CO2, right?

08:42.800 --> 08:43.800
Yeah.

08:43.800 --> 08:44.800
So, okay, I'm going to start wearing a corset.

08:44.800 --> 08:48.080
All right, I mean, and then, I mean, not that you haven't lost a lot of weight, but

08:48.080 --> 08:49.080
still.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.080
So it can only help.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.080
Two birds with one stone.

08:51.080 --> 08:54.520
It's like a really tight shatner girdle.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.640
Yeah, you look like Robert Misham.

08:56.640 --> 08:59.240
And I'll just, I'll just, I'll just have a hair checker for challenging people to

08:59.240 --> 09:00.240
fight.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.240
So it's like, what are you talking about?

09:02.240 --> 09:03.240
Get up here.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.240
I won't accept it.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.240
Just punch you out.

09:05.240 --> 09:10.520
I'll have seen a sweat, and then I'll just make out with the nearest, most racially

09:10.520 --> 09:15.120
diverse woman in the audience to simulate her being green.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.080
Wait, you're only going to fight when you're on stage?

09:18.080 --> 09:19.080
Yeah, I don't know, man.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.680
I lost track of what I was saying.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.520
Let's try to, let's try to, I don't want to get on a lot of tangents tonight.

09:24.520 --> 09:29.080
Is it because you hung out with Greg Proops, Greg Proops right before the show?

09:29.080 --> 09:39.520
Yeah, no, I think that said, I updated you on my health situation, and I think, I haven't

09:39.520 --> 09:40.520
seen you a lot.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.520
You were, you were, you were gone last week.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.440
You were gone when I was gone, and then you were gone again.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.080
I haven't seen you at all.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.080
It's exciting.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.080
I miss you, Dan.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.200
It's cool that while you were gone last week, Erin could fill in.

09:50.200 --> 09:56.760
Yeah, well, I listened to the raw, the raw file of the, of the last Harmontown when

09:56.760 --> 10:04.000
you guys played, when Erin McGathy guest-controlled, and I heard the Dungeons and Dragons where

10:04.000 --> 10:05.720
we introduced a new character.

10:05.720 --> 10:06.720
Yeah.

10:06.720 --> 10:07.720
Yeah.

10:07.720 --> 10:08.720
Yeah.

10:08.720 --> 10:16.920
And she, and that character became a, it was very, it was very vocal?

10:16.920 --> 10:21.560
It was very, it was very pro-active about becoming a permanent member of the adventuring

10:21.560 --> 10:22.560
party.

10:22.560 --> 10:28.160
Yeah, but, I mean, part of it, a lot of it was kind of overtly begging to be a regular

10:28.160 --> 10:31.160
member of a campaign.

10:31.160 --> 10:35.120
Jeff and Erin have kind of a sibling rivalry.

10:35.120 --> 10:38.800
He calls her the girl in the treehouse, or the little sister in the treehouse.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.040
She's like a little sister in a treehouse.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.040
Yeah.

10:42.040 --> 10:46.600
Our next guest.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.520
He was described by Herman Melville as...

10:49.520 --> 10:54.840
The biggest asshole in every sale.

10:54.840 --> 10:59.240
He's an awesome, really, he's truly the smartest man in the world, and he hosts a podcast called

10:59.240 --> 11:00.240
The Smartest Man in the World.

11:00.240 --> 11:04.120
He blew my mind at San Francisco, he's one of Jeff's very good friends from the Who's

11:04.120 --> 11:10.400
Line world, and he's amazing, and we're thrilled to have him here as a surprise friend.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.720
Let's bring Greg Proups up.

11:11.720 --> 11:16.720
Greg Proups, everybody.

11:16.720 --> 11:27.280
Yeah, anyway, you can go there, if you like.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.760
Frank is there.

11:28.760 --> 11:29.760
Yeah.

11:29.760 --> 11:30.760
Greg Proups.

11:30.760 --> 11:31.760
Yeah.

11:31.760 --> 11:35.720
You know, I've been sitting backstage listening to this, what is it, carbon dioxide you're

11:35.720 --> 11:36.720
talking about or whatever?

11:36.720 --> 11:39.800
What a load of shit, ladies and gentlemen.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.800
There's no global warming.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.520
I don't know what the fuck he's talking about.

11:42.520 --> 11:46.600
If you just breathe normally, penguins never die.

11:46.600 --> 11:52.880
Say, I never read the paper or anything, it's good to have somebody up here who's informed.

11:52.880 --> 11:53.880
Yeah.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.720
Who was it, oxygen and carbon dioxide, was it?

11:56.720 --> 12:01.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a delicate balance between them and your bloodstream.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.520
I feel weird standing in front and then staring back over my shoulder.

12:04.520 --> 12:05.520
I like the Greg Proups.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.480
Telly McGillis on the top gun poster.

12:07.480 --> 12:11.840
Queen to Rook 4.

12:11.840 --> 12:15.160
The most dangerous game of all.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.160
Not hunting a human, but human chess.

12:17.160 --> 12:21.640
The most dangerous game is when you're just loose on an island.

12:21.640 --> 12:24.840
The human chess is actually relatively safe.

12:24.840 --> 12:31.400
You could end up being like one of many pieces that lives to the end, sorry.

12:31.400 --> 12:37.720
So Greg Kitten, yeah, Dan Kitten.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.000
Greg, would you rather sit?

12:40.000 --> 12:43.800
Well, no, I don't want Dan to be uncomfortable, he just said he didn't want to look behind

12:43.800 --> 12:44.800
him.

12:44.800 --> 12:45.800
Oh, sit here.

12:45.800 --> 12:46.800
There you go.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.800
Thank you.

12:47.800 --> 12:48.800
Is that what comptrolling is?

12:48.800 --> 12:49.800
Moving chairs?

12:49.800 --> 12:55.320
I've always wondered, shouldn't it be chomp trolling then?

12:55.320 --> 12:58.840
Thank you for that mild laughter, that's what.

12:58.840 --> 13:02.840
I had a jade actually warranted that small of a response.

13:02.840 --> 13:07.520
You were exactly right and you're measured and fucking well thought out response.

13:07.520 --> 13:12.280
Greg, might I say that I appreciate you spending the last 10 minutes in the green room alone

13:12.280 --> 13:16.720
with a vodka and then you came on stage and went headlong straight for the vodka again?

13:16.720 --> 13:21.720
My glass was almost empty when I got out here and my entire life flashed before my eyes.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.280
Like a Guy Madden movie, perplexing.

13:23.280 --> 13:27.560
I don't think the edge of the pool is no longer, you just start to panic and the defense.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.560
Yeah, exactly.

13:28.560 --> 13:34.560
Except the deep end consists of a deep level of lack of vodka.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.560
Exactly.

13:35.560 --> 13:40.520
It's like an ever diminishing, vanishing point full of vodka.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.560
We should have Spencer come up and start prepping his little table, right?

13:43.560 --> 13:44.880
I always make that mistake.

13:44.880 --> 13:47.040
We've had Spencer up here.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.040
Is Spencer here?

13:48.040 --> 13:49.040
Yeah.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.040
Oh, okay.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.040
There he is.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.040
All right.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.040
Spencer, everybody.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.040
Hi, Spencer.

13:54.040 --> 14:01.480
Spencer, of course, for those of you just joining in, Spencer is our 611 D&D Dungeon

14:01.480 --> 14:02.480
Master.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.480
How's your parents?

14:04.480 --> 14:07.040
They don't want me to live with them.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.040
I'll just be in a dick.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.040
Oh, we don't do that in Harmontown?

14:10.040 --> 14:11.040
I'm sorry.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.040
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.520
I forgot this was a basket of cookie kind of place.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.520
I didn't realize it.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.520
I brought a basket of vitriol.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.520
It's so inappropriate.

14:19.520 --> 14:23.480
It's a safe place, but like Oscar the Grouch on Sesame Street, I mean, you're welcome within

14:23.480 --> 14:24.480
an hour.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.480
If you have vitriol, we're only going to make you feel good about having it.

14:27.480 --> 14:28.480
Okay, thank you.

14:28.480 --> 14:31.480
Because I felt uncomfortable just then, but now I feel better again.

14:31.480 --> 14:32.480
See?

14:32.480 --> 14:33.480
That's what we do.

14:33.480 --> 14:36.480
Next week, you'll be farming potatoes with us and...

14:36.480 --> 14:40.640
I'll see you on the ice.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.800
So Greg has never played Dungeons & Dragons before, correct?

14:43.800 --> 14:44.800
Even though you...

14:44.800 --> 14:49.960
No, but I will say this, and I hope I'm not stepping on any pointed shoes that curl over

14:49.960 --> 14:55.480
like that, but are made of green felt when I say this, I think dragons are a plague.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.760
And I'll go further.

14:57.760 --> 14:58.760
They have to be eradicated.

14:58.760 --> 15:04.800
And even if it requires going to a secret place, such as a cavern or perhaps an airy

15:04.800 --> 15:08.480
on top of a mountain that they live in, I am willing to go through the series of questions

15:08.480 --> 15:13.480
that have to be asked, and obstacles that have to be surmounted, and perhaps even groups

15:13.480 --> 15:19.160
of gremlins that are filled with animosity toward anyone who's heading toward the dragon.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.160
It sounds like...

15:20.160 --> 15:22.920
I know you've never played before, but it sounds like you're going to do great.

15:22.920 --> 15:23.920
I just...

15:23.920 --> 15:28.880
I don't play it professionally, but in my mind, I've played it many times.

15:28.880 --> 15:33.120
The dragon is my agent, and the mountain is Wilshire Boulevard.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.680
It's pretty weird how I play it.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.880
Did you ever play Hot Lava when you were a kid, or anything like that, like just make

15:37.880 --> 15:38.880
believe on the playground?

15:38.880 --> 15:39.880
Yeah.

15:39.880 --> 15:40.960
Hot Lava was a goodie.

15:40.960 --> 15:41.960
We also...

15:41.960 --> 15:46.400
What I love about what we actually played Ring Around the Rosey when I was little, and

15:46.400 --> 15:48.400
isn't that like a medieval...

15:48.400 --> 15:49.400
From the plague.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.400
Right.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.400
I mean, like, why are we playing plague games?

15:51.400 --> 15:52.400
Did you have...

15:52.400 --> 15:53.400
Was that even a game?

15:53.400 --> 15:54.400
It's just a fruity dance that...

15:54.400 --> 15:55.400
Right.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.400
It just ends with everyone laying down, right?

15:56.400 --> 15:57.400
Well, that was the best part.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.400
Everyone would lay down.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.400
Oh, yeah.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.400
Ladies man, coming through.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.400
Exactly.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.400
That's four.

16:02.400 --> 16:03.400
Greg.

16:03.400 --> 16:07.400
I wonder what you'd like to share my popsicle, I could split it in half.

16:07.400 --> 16:12.320
Greg, even though you did not play Dungeons and Dragons, you did, if I'm not mistaken,

16:12.320 --> 16:18.080
wear like a cape or a top hat at some point, didn't you have some kind of gothy affected

16:18.080 --> 16:19.080
clothes?

16:19.080 --> 16:22.320
Well, I don't know, gothy douchey.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.560
I went to my junior prom and I carried a cane.

16:24.560 --> 16:25.560
That was 1970s...

16:25.560 --> 16:26.560
1976, ladies and gentlemen.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.560
That was fine.

16:27.560 --> 16:28.560
Thank you.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.560
Thank you very much.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.800
Same hair, parted down the middle.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.600
Same hair, parted down the middle.

16:33.600 --> 16:34.600
Okay.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.600
Thank you.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.600
That was probably...

16:36.600 --> 16:37.600
And no, I didn't get any.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.600
No?

16:38.600 --> 16:39.600
No.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.600
Unsuccessful life, the junior prom.

16:41.600 --> 16:46.160
We went to Portland and there's no segue.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.160
I wore a sky blue tux, if that's if you're interested.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.160
Sky blue tux.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.120
Yeah, with a waistcoat.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.480
And you affected a cane as well.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.880
I carried a cane that had a lion head on it.

16:55.880 --> 16:56.880
Right.

16:56.880 --> 17:02.880
A lion head was in order to keep pussy at bay.

17:02.880 --> 17:06.520
Beating them up with a stick, even though you weren't beating them up with a stick.

17:06.520 --> 17:10.400
I could have dipped that stick in ambergris and dollars and never got a girl to come

17:10.400 --> 17:14.000
near me.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.760
To bloons.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.480
When did you find your sexuality?

17:19.480 --> 17:24.160
When did you become the rampant sexual mare, I'm sorry, a stallion rather.

17:24.160 --> 17:28.680
Oh, so I'm beveling and so passive aggressive, what you just did out of here.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.040
We don't have enough time to discuss the mare.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.040
Backhanded Davis.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.040
Yeah.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.040
I don't know.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.040
Probably 15, I think.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.880
I had a girlfriend when I was 16.

17:36.880 --> 17:37.880
Is that too late in the game?

17:37.880 --> 17:38.880
That's young.

17:38.880 --> 17:39.880
Is it young?

17:39.880 --> 17:40.880
Yeah.

17:40.880 --> 17:41.880
Thank you.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.880
That was Dan's girlfriend.

17:43.880 --> 17:44.880
It was.

17:44.880 --> 17:45.880
I'd like to point that out.

17:45.880 --> 17:46.880
It's an ally.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.880
You were starting a thought and I rudely jumped back.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.880
I was starting a new thought though.

17:50.880 --> 17:54.880
If we could keep following the, do you want to talk about when you lost your virginity?

17:54.880 --> 17:55.880
Oh, no, not at all.

17:55.880 --> 17:56.880
No, no.

17:56.880 --> 18:03.040
This is the open Anthony show in which case it's a du regur.

18:03.040 --> 18:08.000
We went to Portland and Portland is a very liberal, progressive city.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.560
There's a lot of deconstruction of a lot of boundaries going on there.

18:11.560 --> 18:14.680
Things that you wouldn't even expect to be, to need to be deconstructed.

18:14.680 --> 18:17.000
We went to a bar called the green dragon.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.520
Aaron went to the bathroom.

18:18.520 --> 18:23.240
Again, a place that I would avoid until the dragon is slain.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.760
I shall not be going through the portals of the green dragon.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.320
Sorry, Dan.

18:27.320 --> 18:32.240
She came back and a little traumatized and said that the bathrooms instead of being

18:32.240 --> 18:37.960
men and women were sitting and standing.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.680
So it's a new way to like break down.

18:40.680 --> 18:41.680
It is you say.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.680
Yeah.

18:42.680 --> 18:48.960
So if you really think about that, one bathroom was for nothing but men taking shits and women,

18:48.960 --> 18:49.960
all women.

18:49.960 --> 18:55.200
And the other bathroom was for just men who had to do nothing but pee.

18:55.200 --> 19:00.760
It's like the worst, if you're going to like rearrange the bathrooms, that's the worst

19:00.760 --> 19:07.920
thing you could do to women ever is just add shitting men to their side of the war.

19:07.920 --> 19:13.880
And Jeff pointed out, well, there's lots of unisex bathrooms, but those are bathrooms

19:13.880 --> 19:17.960
that have a toilet and a mirror and a sink and a lock on the door.

19:17.960 --> 19:22.400
So yes, women have to suffer the misfortune in those situations of having to go pee or

19:22.400 --> 19:25.640
poop after a man peed or pooped.

19:25.640 --> 19:31.360
This bathroom, the sitting bathroom had several stalls in it.

19:31.360 --> 19:39.680
She was in there with another woman peeing and a guy in between them grunting and making

19:39.680 --> 19:40.680
a real mess.

19:40.680 --> 19:45.920
It's such a horrible violation of everything we know to be right.

19:45.920 --> 19:53.640
I understand the impulse to modernize everything and second guess are precursors, but there

19:53.640 --> 19:57.680
are a couple of things that cavemen got right.

19:57.680 --> 20:02.920
And one of them was the idea that women should be nowhere near men's shit.

20:02.920 --> 20:03.920
Or men's shitting.

20:03.920 --> 20:04.920
Yes.

20:04.920 --> 20:07.440
The next thing we'll be going in the kitchen, you know what I mean?

20:07.440 --> 20:08.440
There's a few areas.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.440
No.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.080
Never the twain shall meet, as they say.

20:11.080 --> 20:14.400
Next thing you know, dragons will be outside of dungeons.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.400
Easy, Craig.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.520
Not on my watch.

20:16.520 --> 20:17.520
Easy.

20:17.520 --> 20:21.920
Not as long as my scimitar nembutal has a mind to say about it.

20:21.920 --> 20:22.920
Down nembutal.

20:22.920 --> 20:26.080
Craig, if you're going to blow.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.080
Blow cool.

20:27.080 --> 20:35.080
All right, so you notice there's a forest of microphones up here.

20:35.080 --> 20:40.040
That's because, as we mentioned last week, Erin McGathy was guest comptrolling.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.520
So she had a character made for her in our D&D campaign.

20:43.520 --> 20:50.680
And much to Jeff Chagrin, she made herself a part of the campaign permanently.

20:50.680 --> 21:03.640
So Erin McGathy needs to come up and play her character, Erin McGathy.

21:03.640 --> 21:10.480
And then we welcome back in his selfless rule as the puppeteer of the cosmos, Dungeon Master

21:10.480 --> 21:11.480
Spencer.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.480
Spencer, everybody!

21:12.480 --> 21:13.480
Who can forget?

21:13.480 --> 21:18.480
How's it going, you guys?

21:18.480 --> 21:21.120
Greg, I'm sorry about that neck kiss.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.280
I forced you into a neck kiss.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.280
I didn't even notice.

21:24.280 --> 21:26.280
I was just happy to see you again.

21:26.280 --> 21:30.240
You were the only person who applauded during one of the earlier things I said.

21:30.240 --> 21:34.560
This crowd has mounted against me like a fucking Romney rally.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.560
They're Harmonites.

21:35.560 --> 21:41.720
I mean, they have a xenophobic, you know, anything that's not Harmon.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.200
Oh, because I'm an Alice Lander?

21:43.200 --> 21:44.200
Yeah, yeah.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.920
But that doesn't mean they don't accept you.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.160
They're protective of me.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.360
They're scared you might go for my throat.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.360
I understand.

21:50.360 --> 21:55.880
I had a dog when I was a kid that bit a guy because he was throwing away newspapers and

21:55.880 --> 21:59.920
he was holding a wire and he was protecting my brother and we had to put it down.

21:59.920 --> 22:00.920
Oh no.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.040
All right, let's move on.

22:03.040 --> 22:06.640
Did that story really end with the death of a beloved dog?

22:06.640 --> 22:07.640
Yeah, it did.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.720
Fuck, you're brave like Disney.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.720
But then there were puppies.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.720
When we got home, there were puppies.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.720
I bought a zoo.

22:15.720 --> 22:24.080
Beethoven, get off the couch.

22:24.080 --> 22:28.080
You are never more than five minutes in the movie we bought a zoo from a character shrugging

22:28.080 --> 22:29.960
and saying we bought a zoo.

22:29.960 --> 22:32.280
I just want you to know that.

22:32.280 --> 22:36.560
And that is never a sign of a confidently written film.

22:36.560 --> 22:43.760
Imagine if you were watching Star Wars and every five minutes, I just went, Star Wars.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.680
They never said it once.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.680
Citizen Kane never went, you know, no one ever went.

22:47.680 --> 22:48.680
Citizen Kane.

22:48.680 --> 22:49.680
You're real Citizen Kane.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.680
You're fired, Citizen Kane.

22:51.680 --> 22:53.680
It's, you know, it's just a...

22:53.680 --> 22:57.320
Now Dan, what compelled you to buy that movie because first of all, I've never heard of

22:57.320 --> 22:58.320
it.

22:58.320 --> 22:59.440
Second of all, what the fuck?

22:59.440 --> 23:01.360
We went through every fucking movie ever.

23:01.360 --> 23:04.960
We watched, we watched Savages with Travolta.

23:04.960 --> 23:05.960
We watched...

23:05.960 --> 23:06.960
Safe House.

23:06.960 --> 23:07.960
Safe House.

23:07.960 --> 23:08.960
Which one?

23:08.960 --> 23:09.960
Safe House.

23:09.960 --> 23:10.960
It's everyone.

23:10.960 --> 23:11.960
That's the weird D&D character.

23:11.960 --> 23:12.960
I don't know.

23:12.960 --> 23:21.120
Man, I know we walked away from Portland $177 into bad Hollywood.

23:21.120 --> 23:24.960
Like, they got us, the house won.

23:24.960 --> 23:25.960
You bought these or rented these?

23:25.960 --> 23:26.960
Well, I don't know.

23:26.960 --> 23:27.960
What do you call it?

23:27.960 --> 23:28.960
We rented them.

23:28.960 --> 23:29.960
At the hotel.

23:29.960 --> 23:30.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:30.960 --> 23:31.960
I got some.

23:31.960 --> 23:36.440
And I rented a lot of movies while Dan was sleeping and he woke up to We Bout a Zoo.

23:36.440 --> 23:37.760
It's not about me.

23:37.760 --> 23:40.760
Dungeons and Dragons.

23:40.760 --> 23:41.760
We Bought a Zoo.

23:41.760 --> 23:42.760
We Bought a Zoo.

23:42.760 --> 23:43.760
We Bought a Zoo.

23:43.760 --> 23:44.760
That's fine.

23:44.760 --> 23:46.200
It's fine that you Bought a Zoo.

23:46.200 --> 23:51.760
The problem is then you made a movie about it and I'm watching it.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.760
You have my money.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.760
We Bought a Zoo.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.760
Dan was half asleep during the entire movie.

23:57.760 --> 24:02.760
I was just waking up in like a fever dream saying, Bought a Zoo?

24:02.760 --> 24:04.760
And then back asleep.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.760
Say it one more time.

24:06.760 --> 24:08.320
There was no conflict in the movie.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.960
They Bought a Zoo.

24:10.960 --> 24:15.960
If you mapped it on my story circle, six of the eight points on the circle would say,

24:15.960 --> 24:18.960
We Bought a Zoo.

24:18.960 --> 24:19.960
Wow.

24:19.960 --> 24:20.960
To be fair, to be fair.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.960
In the middle of the film, the truth that they arrive at is that they Bought a fucking

24:24.960 --> 24:25.960
Zoo.

24:25.960 --> 24:30.960
To be fair, that movie was written using a story puddle.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.960
Halfway through, did they lose the zoo?

24:33.960 --> 24:34.960
No!

24:34.960 --> 24:35.960
No!

24:35.960 --> 24:38.960
Halfway through, they said, We Bought a Zoo.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.960
Which they Bought on page 10.

24:40.960 --> 24:46.960
They fucking Bought it and then they just sat on it and ran it.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.960
Well, that's Higer Died.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.960
They kept contriving things.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.960
This is based on a true story about, guess what?

24:52.960 --> 24:54.960
They Bought a fucking Zoo and nothing happened.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.960
It's based on a true story about going to the dry cleaner.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.960
So if you make that a new movie, you have to break it up with contrivances.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.960
It rains in the movie.

25:02.960 --> 25:03.960
It rains for days.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.960
It's not going to rain.

25:05.960 --> 25:11.960
If they were sitting there, these writers are going like, What is the enemy of a zoo?

25:11.960 --> 25:15.960
What's the Mechagodzilla to a zoo's Godzilla?

25:15.960 --> 25:16.960
Rain.

25:16.960 --> 25:17.960
Rain.

25:17.960 --> 25:19.960
I never go to the zoo when it rains.

25:19.960 --> 25:23.960
God damn it, Preskin, you're a genius.

25:23.960 --> 25:25.960
Okay, how do you get rid of rain?

25:25.960 --> 25:26.960
How do you get rid of rain?

25:26.960 --> 25:27.960
Wait a while.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.960
Sir, you wait.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.960
And then it stops raining after, God damn it, you're right!

25:32.960 --> 25:33.960
And that's what happens.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.960
It rains for a while, then it stops raining.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.960
Then there's a tree in the road.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.960
Then the people find out they can walk around the tree.

25:39.960 --> 25:41.960
I'm not exaggerating.

25:41.960 --> 25:46.960
And every time one of these contrived high points happens, they cue this like,

25:46.960 --> 25:48.960
Awimawai Awimawai.

25:48.960 --> 25:52.960
They're just this fucking shitty African Paul Simon shit.

25:52.960 --> 25:56.960
It's just designed to don't worry, be happy, you're aorta.

25:56.960 --> 26:03.960
It just goes in your chest like an invasive...

26:03.960 --> 26:05.960
African people just chanting things.

26:05.960 --> 26:06.960
Dan, who's the bad guy?

26:06.960 --> 26:09.960
Who's the bad guy?

26:09.960 --> 26:10.960
You.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.960
For watching it.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.960
And I'm not kidding.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.960
Because the movie keeps jabbing you in the ribs and going,

26:16.960 --> 26:19.960
Why aren't you crying, you scrooge?

26:19.960 --> 26:22.960
Why aren't you crying like everyone in the movie?

26:22.960 --> 26:24.960
They bought a zoo, you dick.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.960
No one comes in and goes like,

26:26.960 --> 26:29.960
Nice place for a zoo.

26:29.960 --> 26:31.960
Or an oil well.

26:31.960 --> 26:33.960
No, no, no, no.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.960
The last person who put one here sank into an enormous crater.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.960
No, that's one of six things missing from the story.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.960
Is a guy going like,

26:41.960 --> 26:43.960
Yeah, you know what's under this zoo?

26:43.960 --> 26:44.960
Diamonds.

26:44.960 --> 26:46.960
Blood diamonds.

26:46.960 --> 26:48.960
Lion killing blood diamonds.

26:48.960 --> 26:53.960
We're gonna have blind children come in and dig them out with toothbrushes.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.960
But the lions will eat them.

26:55.960 --> 26:56.960
That's the point.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.960
But I thought you wanted the diamonds.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.960
I'm high.

27:00.960 --> 27:03.960
You're the bad guy and you're high, yes.

27:03.960 --> 27:06.960
I didn't buy a zoo.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.960
Honey, I just woke up.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.960
We didn't buy a zoo.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.960
No you did, you bought a zoo.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.960
I just woke up a third time, it's like conception.

27:14.960 --> 27:17.960
Zoo.

27:17.960 --> 27:21.960
We bought a dream zoo, dream zoo.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.960
Zoo conspiracy.

27:23.960 --> 27:25.960
The lion was the architect.

27:25.960 --> 27:28.960
It was the lion's dream the whole time.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.960
You're in the zoo.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.960
Yeah.

27:32.960 --> 27:34.960
We bought a zoo.

27:34.960 --> 27:37.960
They shrug and they say we bought a zoo a million times.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.960
Alright, so we've gone on.

27:39.960 --> 27:42.960
I don't want to get off on any tangents tonight.

27:42.960 --> 27:48.960
Dan, I think if at any point this train jumps the tracks during Harmontown,

27:48.960 --> 27:51.960
you could just say, I got a podcast.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.960
I got a podcast.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.960
I got a town.

27:55.960 --> 27:59.960
You know, Kettle One tweeted me today.

27:59.960 --> 28:02.960
I'm just saying in a world where we're doing sponsored bits,

28:02.960 --> 28:05.960
I have a relationship with Kettle One.

28:05.960 --> 28:07.960
Both internally and externally.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.960
I have a fundamental relationship with Kettle One

28:10.960 --> 28:12.960
in that it's the spinach to my pot pie.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.960
You have respiratory alcoholism.

28:15.960 --> 28:18.960
And then now I have my Twitter buddy.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.960
I don't know, I'm just saying.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.960
So are you saying we should drop Nike as our unofficial sponsor?

28:23.960 --> 28:27.960
If you have fun tonight, it may be indirectly the result of Kettle One.

28:27.960 --> 28:30.960
I can almost guarantee it.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.960
I have some copy written down from a Nike shoe.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.960
Why don't we just plug a new Kettle One shoe?

28:35.960 --> 28:37.960
Give it a shot.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.960
The new Kettle One Tiempo,

28:39.960 --> 28:44.960
combining the perfect blend of comfort and superior ball feel.

28:44.960 --> 28:46.960
I'm just going to stop there.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.960
Ball view? Ball feel.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.960
I adore that.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.960
When you're hunting a dragon, there's nothing more relaxing.

28:53.960 --> 28:57.960
Greg, how would you like to combine the perfect blend of comfort

28:57.960 --> 28:59.960
and superior ball feel?

28:59.960 --> 29:01.960
Would I?

29:01.960 --> 29:05.960
It's like reading Balzac while lying in a bowl of pudding.

29:05.960 --> 29:14.960
The Kettle One Tiempo Legend Four Elite is designed for the ultimate touch.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.960
I heard that.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.960
You can't make a shoe and say ball feel.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.960
Spencer, distribute the character sheets.

29:22.960 --> 29:25.960
Can you pass this down to Jeff?

29:25.960 --> 29:29.960
Spencer is now distributing our Identities and Dragons character sheets.

29:29.960 --> 29:33.960
This is that point in each episode that all you ladies look forward to.

29:33.960 --> 29:35.960
It's our...

29:35.960 --> 29:37.960
What the fuck is this?

29:37.960 --> 29:39.960
Who's Jeff?

29:39.960 --> 29:41.960
I'm Quark.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.960
Pass it all to Jeff.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.960
Oh, okay.

29:45.960 --> 29:47.960
You don't have one yet. I'll give you one.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.960
He's going to give you one.

29:49.960 --> 29:51.960
You have to be woven into the tapestry of our fate.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.960
Okay.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.960
Many thanks to you, weary traveler,

29:55.960 --> 29:57.960
and I hope that upon the path we travel,

29:57.960 --> 29:59.960
good fortune will find you.

29:59.960 --> 30:02.960
Holy shit, we're going to get this game.

30:02.960 --> 30:07.960
Are you sure you haven't played this before?

30:07.960 --> 30:08.960
Are you a ringer?

30:08.960 --> 30:10.960
Not professionally.

30:10.960 --> 30:13.960
I quit right before it went pro.

30:13.960 --> 30:17.960
Are you going to produce a lion-headed cane from your coat?

30:17.960 --> 30:19.960
It is to be fervently wished.

30:19.960 --> 30:21.960
All right, McGathey, what was your character's name?

30:21.960 --> 30:25.960
I only know it's like one of the most forgettable, slippery...

30:25.960 --> 30:28.960
Dear sir, I am Mulrainee Sidhanna. Ha-ha, adventure.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.960
Mulrainee...

30:30.960 --> 30:32.960
Oh, what are...

30:32.960 --> 30:33.960
Mulrainee Sidhanna.

30:33.960 --> 30:35.960
Mulrainee, okay.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.960
But I'd be whatever you'd like, for I am half-elf, half-human,

30:39.960 --> 30:41.960
and all pleasure.

30:41.960 --> 30:43.960
Wow!

30:43.960 --> 30:45.960
All right.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.960
Spencer?

30:47.960 --> 30:51.960
All right, so when we last met,

30:51.960 --> 30:54.960
you had found Mulrainee trying to find the...

30:54.960 --> 30:56.960
or when you were looking at the sign,

30:56.960 --> 30:59.960
you decided that you should kill this embermaller

30:59.960 --> 31:01.960
that's been wreaking havoc on the town.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.960
All right, I saw a sign in the tavern that was like a lion creature.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.960
That's been killing cats and dogs and people and stuff?

31:07.960 --> 31:09.960
Yeah, it's been killing some things

31:09.960 --> 31:11.960
and burning some crops and causing some havoc.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.960
So you were in the tavern making sure that...

31:14.960 --> 31:18.960
Are we in Calabasas? Where are we right now?

31:18.960 --> 31:21.960
It's the city of Thornvale.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.960
To be sure.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.960
Not that fell place.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.960
I met an oath I would never return there.

31:27.960 --> 31:30.960
But Greg, didn't you used to do comedy there?

31:30.960 --> 31:34.960
Yeah, I played the palace.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.960
There's two times in your career you play Thornvale.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.960
Once on the way up and once on the way down.

31:40.960 --> 31:45.960
It is so nice to be back.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.960
Holy shit!

31:47.960 --> 31:49.960
He doesn't even have his character sheet yet.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.960
I'm here in the field!

31:51.960 --> 31:58.960
I'm in the field!

31:58.960 --> 32:02.960
Oh, shit.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.960
So, deciding to join forces, you retired to the tavern

32:05.960 --> 32:08.960
and it is now the morning and you're waking up in your room.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.960
You old prancing pony, what's the name of the tavern do we know?

32:11.960 --> 32:12.960
Cha-cha-cha's tavern.

32:12.960 --> 32:13.960
Cha-cha's tavern.

32:13.960 --> 32:15.960
Cha-cha's?

32:15.960 --> 32:18.960
All I know is I went to a berserker rage.

32:18.960 --> 32:19.960
We killed a pig.

32:19.960 --> 32:22.960
I woke up in the morning and there was a homophobic elf

32:22.960 --> 32:24.960
hanging out with us.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.960
Not a homophobic, sir.

32:27.960 --> 32:30.960
Encouraging of new love.

32:30.960 --> 32:31.960
A gardener.

32:31.960 --> 32:34.960
Yeah, but he told you that we're not a couple.

32:34.960 --> 32:39.960
Spencer, as per an agreement that I decided we had

32:39.960 --> 32:42.960
between these two rounds, we were all meeting for breakfast

32:42.960 --> 32:44.960
down in the common room.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.960
All right, in the common room of a pub,

32:46.960 --> 32:49.960
you seem to notice an air of discomfort.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.960
Yeah, between Jeff and Aaron.

32:51.960 --> 32:52.960
I mean, quark.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.960
Quark and Mulraine.

32:55.960 --> 32:58.960
Mulraine.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.960
There appears to have been a fire the night previous

33:01.960 --> 33:04.960
and people think it might be resulting from

33:04.960 --> 33:06.960
the Ember-Mollers assault.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.960
Oh, a fire in the town?

33:09.960 --> 33:10.960
Yeah, some people are talking.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.960
You hear in people talk about fires in the pub.

33:12.960 --> 33:13.960
What's this town's name?

33:13.960 --> 33:14.960
Thornvale.

33:14.960 --> 33:15.960
Thornvale.

33:15.960 --> 33:19.960
Finally, a conflagration has consumed that cursed place.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.960
Wait, who's this guy?

33:21.960 --> 33:24.960
Wait, Sharpey Buttsalot.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.960
Me thinks we have a new member to our team.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.960
A voice speaker from the table.

33:28.960 --> 33:30.960
Yon.

33:30.960 --> 33:32.960
Is that true?

33:32.960 --> 33:34.960
Is he just a disembodied voice?

33:34.960 --> 33:36.960
He's a disembodied voice.

33:36.960 --> 33:43.960
I am Percocet, the giver of feelings that are wild.

33:43.960 --> 33:45.960
My humblest apology, Sharpey.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.960
I slept very hard last night.

33:47.960 --> 33:52.960
Now that you're awake, may I offer my apology

33:52.960 --> 33:55.960
for suggesting that there was a romantic relationship

33:55.960 --> 33:56.960
between you and Buttsalot?

33:56.960 --> 33:57.960
I was asleep.

33:57.960 --> 33:59.960
I just heard about it.

33:59.960 --> 34:01.960
Well, either way, I apologize.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.960
I love happiness and balloons.

34:03.960 --> 34:04.960
I'm like a rainbow.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.960
You don't know where I start or end.

34:07.960 --> 34:08.960
Balloons don't end.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.960
Gentlemen, please.

34:10.960 --> 34:16.960
My character sighs loudly.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.960
We have lately just rode in.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.960
Who must one forlade in order to obtain ale in this shithole?

34:22.960 --> 34:25.960
Sharpey, I say we out into the streets

34:25.960 --> 34:27.960
and conquer this deadly beast that beat

34:27.960 --> 34:30.960
forting the cats and dogs of Thornvale.

34:30.960 --> 34:32.960
We out into the streets, Spencer.

34:32.960 --> 34:34.960
You see the scene of a fire.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.960
It's a farmhouse, or was.

34:37.960 --> 34:43.960
Nice. Nice.

34:43.960 --> 34:48.960
Sharpey, me thinks we are in business.

34:48.960 --> 34:51.960
I like that he didn't want to roll the dice

34:51.960 --> 34:52.960
and making the pause.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.960
He didn't want to take a dramatic pause.

34:54.960 --> 34:55.960
He's like, fuck these guys.

34:55.960 --> 34:56.960
They talk about it.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.960
You can't give them an inch of leeway.

34:58.960 --> 35:02.960
It was a farmhouse, or was.

35:02.960 --> 35:03.960
It's just good writing.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.960
If he paused, one of us would talk for 10 minutes.

35:06.960 --> 35:11.960
More like a farmhouse.

35:11.960 --> 35:16.960
We bought a farmhouse.

35:16.960 --> 35:20.960
What are we going to do with all these domesticated animals?

35:20.960 --> 35:22.960
I hope there's no dampness.

35:22.960 --> 35:26.960
I examine the remains of the farmhouse, Spencer.

35:26.960 --> 35:30.960
You see an old man crying over the remains of his farmhouse.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.960
I'm not good at language.

35:32.960 --> 35:35.960
Sharpey, you want to talk to the old man?

35:35.960 --> 35:38.960
Greg can play the old man.

35:38.960 --> 35:39.960
You can play the old man, yeah.

35:39.960 --> 35:47.960
I like the old man.

35:47.960 --> 35:51.960
The old man appears to be of a non-human race.

35:51.960 --> 35:54.960
Non-human?

35:54.960 --> 35:56.960
Visto.

35:56.960 --> 36:02.960
I check my inventory for lozenges.

36:02.960 --> 36:14.960
I'm an elderly gentleman.

36:14.960 --> 36:16.960
What's on here?

36:16.960 --> 36:21.960
I cast Ricola.

36:21.960 --> 36:27.960
Ricola's faithful language.

36:27.960 --> 36:32.960
The elder one, I don't know this Andy Kaufman-esque tongue of which you speak.

36:32.960 --> 36:36.960
I only want to express my sympathy for the loss of your home

36:36.960 --> 36:41.960
and inquire as to how it became so distraught.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.960
Mi baldo.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.960
This is what we're talking about.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.960
Necomorph?

36:47.960 --> 36:48.960
Spencer, what were they called?

36:48.960 --> 36:49.960
Embermolar?

36:49.960 --> 36:50.960
What were they called?

36:50.960 --> 36:51.960
What?

36:51.960 --> 36:53.960
The people who set fire to the goddamn village.

36:53.960 --> 36:54.960
Embermolar, yeah.

36:54.960 --> 36:55.960
Embermoles?

36:55.960 --> 36:56.960
Yeah.

36:56.960 --> 36:57.960
Embermoles.

36:57.960 --> 37:03.960
The embermoles of Vosto, the embermoles of Hando, the embermoles of Hindo.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.960
Jeff, I understand one word this guy is saying,

37:06.960 --> 37:10.960
and it's the same word on the poster in the tavern, this embermolar.

37:10.960 --> 37:11.960
Embermoles.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.960
No, not for embermoles.

37:14.960 --> 37:15.960
Old man.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.960
It's like Tony Shalube in Quick Change.

37:18.960 --> 37:21.960
Tony Shalube, you know him?

37:21.960 --> 37:25.960
I love him in Quick Change movies.

37:25.960 --> 37:26.960
Old man.

37:26.960 --> 37:29.960
Older dwarf.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.960
Homosexual.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.960
Aye aye.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.960
Ah, full of pleasure.

37:35.960 --> 37:36.960
As always.

37:36.960 --> 37:37.960
As always.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.960
I like a good fight when I can find one.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.960
Do you see which way this beast went?

37:41.960 --> 37:42.960
Passo.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.960
Quentado.

37:44.960 --> 37:47.960
Pesto di di dragone.

37:47.960 --> 37:50.960
He's been passed the dragon.

37:50.960 --> 37:51.960
Spencer, yeah.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.960
We have to pass the dragon to get to the thing?

37:53.960 --> 37:59.960
You can pass or you can do what the fuck you like.

37:59.960 --> 38:01.960
He's holding a baguette.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.960
Let's take his baguette.

38:03.960 --> 38:04.960
And he has a penguin on his head.

38:04.960 --> 38:06.960
Wait a minute.

38:06.960 --> 38:09.960
Spencer, is any of what we're saying true?

38:09.960 --> 38:13.960
Yeah, he motions to the west and points in a direction.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.960
Pencil.

38:15.960 --> 38:16.960
Well.

38:16.960 --> 38:17.960
Is Pencil the west?

38:17.960 --> 38:19.960
Are you guys ready to head west?

38:19.960 --> 38:20.960
Get this embermolar?

38:20.960 --> 38:25.960
I mean, being a ranger can track the beast if she can successfully do that.

38:25.960 --> 38:28.960
Of course I can successfully do that.

38:28.960 --> 38:32.960
I'll go pack up our bags and our treasure that we got last night and we'll away.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.960
Padum padum.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.960
Oh, he wants a tip.

38:36.960 --> 38:37.960
No, no.

38:37.960 --> 38:43.960
It's customary to tip people after asking them about their bruce.

38:43.960 --> 38:46.960
I give the old man four coppers.

38:46.960 --> 38:50.960
I give the old man a bag of dirt.

38:52.960 --> 38:56.960
And I give him a promise that his children will walk upon the rainbows.

38:58.960 --> 39:03.960
Miss Gorsan, you're about to two friends at Dushbagge.

39:04.960 --> 39:05.960
I'm sorry.

39:06.960 --> 39:11.960
Hey, as we walked on the road, I whispered to Sharpie, was that a Jewish, Italian, French?

39:12.960 --> 39:14.960
Because that character was a real Euro rail pass.

39:14.960 --> 39:17.960
I am doing Christophe Lambert, Alexander.

39:18.960 --> 39:19.960
Oh, he can hear us, he can hear us.

39:20.960 --> 39:21.960
My hearing is acute.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.960
I am not acute. My hearing is acute. I am also Chico Marx.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.960
This way, friends. Adventure.

39:32.960 --> 39:33.960
We had West.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.960
By the way, I thought Mulraine was a dude.

39:37.960 --> 39:38.960
Mulraine's a dude, yeah.

39:38.960 --> 39:39.960
Did I say she?

39:39.960 --> 39:40.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:40.960 --> 39:41.960
Sorry guys.

39:41.960 --> 39:42.960
Seems sorry audience.

39:42.960 --> 39:43.960
So attractive.

39:44.960 --> 39:47.960
Sometimes I appear to be a woman because I'm so beautiful.

39:48.960 --> 39:51.960
Spencer, Spencer, how are we traveling? By foot? On horse? How are we going?

39:52.960 --> 39:58.960
You're walking on foot, Mulraine's leading the path, bending over and looking at all sorts of signs and symbols of possible animal.

39:59.960 --> 40:00.960
This way, regard my asshole.

40:02.960 --> 40:07.960
You come upon the remains of a burned field. The path seems to stop.

40:07.960 --> 40:11.960
No one walk on this field. It's burned.

40:12.960 --> 40:13.960
Stop.

40:13.960 --> 40:15.960
Well, that means that Mulraine must have been here.

40:15.960 --> 40:16.960
The Ember Mahler.

40:16.960 --> 40:17.960
Ember Mahler.

40:17.960 --> 40:18.960
Mulraine is...

40:19.960 --> 40:20.960
There's Ember Mahler.

40:20.960 --> 40:21.960
Oh my God, he followed us.

40:22.960 --> 40:24.960
He's like a homeless guy in Koreatown.

40:25.960 --> 40:27.960
Shoo, shoo, shoo.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.960
Four coppers, you cheap son of a bitch.

40:30.960 --> 40:37.960
Wait, Spencer, I pick up a stick.

40:38.960 --> 40:39.960
I throw the stick back toward the town.

40:40.960 --> 40:41.960
All right, I'm going.

40:43.960 --> 40:46.960
But don't say I didn't warn you.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.960
Now he's from Puerto Rico? What the hell is going on?

40:51.960 --> 40:54.960
I am John Lithgow in Bakarubanzai.

40:54.960 --> 40:59.960
He left sandwiches.

41:00.960 --> 41:01.960
All right, we're in a burnt field.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.960
All right, I investigate the field.

41:04.960 --> 41:08.960
After the old man leaves, you turn around to investigate the field

41:08.960 --> 41:11.960
and notice that a white horse has been trotting into view.

41:12.960 --> 41:16.960
But no normal white horse was this, for it was a unicorn.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.960
Do you know how rare these things are?

41:21.960 --> 41:22.960
A chew.

41:23.960 --> 41:28.960
The unicorn bends down and touches its horn to what looks like a charred dead rabbit.

41:28.960 --> 41:31.960
You see a blinding flash of light and a healthy rabbit.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.960
Wow, boing, boing, boing.

41:34.960 --> 41:35.960
And bounces into the underbrush.

41:36.960 --> 41:37.960
That's not there because it's a burnt field.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.960
Wait, it brought the rabbit back to life?

41:39.960 --> 41:41.960
It seemed to bring the rabbit back to life.

41:42.960 --> 41:44.960
Sharpie, Neil Sadaka.

41:44.960 --> 41:47.960
Neil Sadaka.

41:48.960 --> 41:49.960
Mulraine Muldoon?

41:52.960 --> 41:53.960
Mulraine Saldana?

41:53.960 --> 41:54.960
Yes.

41:55.960 --> 41:57.960
That horse just touched a dead rabbit and it came back to life.

41:58.960 --> 41:59.960
That's no horse quark.

41:59.960 --> 42:00.960
It's no horse.

42:00.960 --> 42:01.960
That's what he said.

42:03.960 --> 42:04.960
It's a unicorn.

42:07.960 --> 42:08.960
It's a unicorn.

42:08.960 --> 42:09.960
It's a horse with one horn.

42:09.960 --> 42:10.960
It's a unicorn.

42:10.960 --> 42:13.960
I am Tylenol with codeine.

42:15.960 --> 42:19.960
And a warm sense of well-being should imbue your body with my very presence.

42:19.960 --> 42:22.960
Steve the Rabbit, I have brought it back to life.

42:22.960 --> 42:23.960
What be your name?

42:24.960 --> 42:25.960
Tylenol with codeine.

42:27.960 --> 42:29.960
I thought you just said you were high on codeine.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.960
No, I'm Tylenol with codeine.

42:31.960 --> 42:34.960
I'm the good kind of Tylenol, not the disappointing kind.

42:35.960 --> 42:39.960
Dear unicorn, why this rabbit and not the entire field?

42:39.960 --> 42:40.960
I am selective.

42:45.960 --> 42:49.960
Tylenol, did you see the ember mauler that did this?

42:49.960 --> 42:50.960
The ember maul.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.960
Oh, they are most evil.

42:52.960 --> 42:55.960
Much who havoc have they wrought upon the land.

42:55.960 --> 43:00.960
I used to prance freely amongst the daisies and gladiolas, the snapdragons and the...

43:00.960 --> 43:01.960
What are those little purple ones?

43:01.960 --> 43:02.960
I love those.

43:03.960 --> 43:04.960
Tulips.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.960
No, I have not met you.

43:06.960 --> 43:16.960
And yet, the ember maul, much havoc have reeked and they must be stopped for this land was once pure.

43:18.960 --> 43:22.960
Now it is fouled with the horrible stench of their enormous wands.

43:23.960 --> 43:26.960
Have you seen, have you done battle with them before?

43:26.960 --> 43:31.960
Seen them, I have smelt them from kilometers away, for my senses are most highly developed.

43:31.960 --> 43:34.960
I would say acute, but the old man used it earlier.

43:34.960 --> 43:35.960
And?

43:35.960 --> 43:41.960
Charmy, I care not to do battle alongside this winged horse who speaketh so fruitily.

43:41.960 --> 43:42.960
What?

43:42.960 --> 43:46.960
Fruitily I speaketh, thou art a basket of raspberries thyself.

43:48.960 --> 43:53.960
Why dost thou not give me thy name, O Jamba Juice, and I will inform you when your cup is ready.

43:53.960 --> 43:54.960
Oh!

43:54.960 --> 43:55.960
Oh!

43:55.960 --> 44:00.960
White stallion, I shall disembowel thee with my sword for words so important.

44:00.960 --> 44:01.960
Warck!

44:01.960 --> 44:02.960
Take it easy.

44:02.960 --> 44:06.960
Unicorns are very powerful, he could make a most unlikely ally.

44:06.960 --> 44:09.960
Pifty threatens not your love.

44:09.960 --> 44:11.960
Are thou but half-elf?

44:11.960 --> 44:12.960
Yes.

44:12.960 --> 44:15.960
I am half-elf, and I can speak for myself.

44:18.960 --> 44:22.960
Indeed, thy companions art most sexist.

44:22.960 --> 44:27.960
I agree, sir, but it matters not, for I am like the breeze.

44:27.960 --> 44:30.960
I flow and pleasure.

44:30.960 --> 44:34.960
Like the wind thou dost blow.

44:34.960 --> 44:42.960
I, unicorn, may I become your ally and ride you, or you can ride me, although my back will break,

44:42.960 --> 44:45.960
but I want to not be a unicornist.

44:45.960 --> 44:51.960
Indeed, Elflet, thoust may mount me while thine friends trail behind and step away from my stool

44:51.960 --> 44:53.960
in a haphazard manner.

44:55.960 --> 44:56.960
Ha ha ha!

44:56.960 --> 45:02.960
Well, how do you like that?

45:05.960 --> 45:08.960
Listen, maybe we should split up.

45:10.960 --> 45:11.960
What is that ahead?

45:11.960 --> 45:12.960
I see an emerald light.

45:12.960 --> 45:16.960
Is it not true, Spencer, who holdeth the book?

45:17.960 --> 45:19.960
On the horizon, you see a light.

45:19.960 --> 45:22.960
It seems to be a fire, but it is not spreading.

45:22.960 --> 45:25.960
It does appear to be coming closer.

45:25.960 --> 45:26.960
Uh-oh.

45:26.960 --> 45:28.960
I see ember muller headlights.

45:30.960 --> 45:31.960
Possibly.

45:31.960 --> 45:37.960
Indeed, for the ember mull, I have mispronounced it.

45:37.960 --> 45:43.960
Listen, gang, if this beast is as dangerous as its wake of destruction is suggested,

45:43.960 --> 45:48.960
it might be prudent for us to find a hiding spot and wait until it gets there.

45:48.960 --> 45:50.960
You sound unsure.

45:50.960 --> 45:51.960
I'm just a little high.

45:51.960 --> 45:56.960
You told me last night that you, or this morning rather, that you'd found a crystal

45:56.960 --> 45:58.960
of the greatness of something.

45:58.960 --> 46:01.960
Might that be of any value to us?

46:01.960 --> 46:04.960
Possibly, yeah.

46:04.960 --> 46:13.960
Oh, dickless human, who like one oviparous strode behind me when thoust might have mounted

46:13.960 --> 46:16.960
if thou had objected in any way.

46:16.960 --> 46:18.960
Wouldst thou not use thine talisman?

46:18.960 --> 46:22.960
For I have the power to...

46:22.960 --> 46:24.960
I have the power to detect evil.

46:24.960 --> 46:25.960
Yeah.

46:25.960 --> 46:28.960
And evil I do detect.

46:28.960 --> 46:31.960
You detect evil coming from the direction of the fire.

46:31.960 --> 46:32.960
Oh.

46:32.960 --> 46:33.960
Shit.

46:33.960 --> 46:35.960
Balm-a-gee.

46:35.960 --> 46:40.960
Dost thou wish to bone out, or dost thou wish to grow a pair?

46:40.960 --> 46:43.960
Would there be any visual cover in this area?

46:43.960 --> 46:44.960
Where are we?

46:44.960 --> 46:49.960
There's some large rocks and some skeletal burnt trees to your right.

46:49.960 --> 46:51.960
Let's hide behind those rocks, you guys.

46:51.960 --> 47:02.960
As a creature with wild empathy, I wish to approach the light, for I feel for the light.

47:02.960 --> 47:08.960
I too burn inside with a green light, albeit not exactly a green light, but I wish to

47:08.960 --> 47:09.960
approach the light.

47:09.960 --> 47:11.960
You wish to approach the fire.

47:11.960 --> 47:12.960
It burns closer.

47:12.960 --> 47:18.960
You can see it is getting close enough to make out, and it is not just a fire, but the

47:18.960 --> 47:20.960
form of a powerful feline.

47:20.960 --> 47:26.960
It seems to be the size of a lion, but with a flaming mane and twin tails made of fire.

47:26.960 --> 47:28.960
Was I clear about hiding behind a rock?

47:28.960 --> 47:30.960
Yeah, you're behind a rock.

47:30.960 --> 47:32.960
She's walking towards this.

47:32.960 --> 47:35.960
The unicorn determined that it was absolutely evil.

47:35.960 --> 47:38.960
Moldane by the tears of Salduron!

47:38.960 --> 47:41.960
Hide ye self!

47:41.960 --> 47:49.960
I would like to say that my character has also read the great Gatsby, so I'm intrigued by

47:49.960 --> 47:50.960
the green light.

47:50.960 --> 47:52.960
I head towards it.

47:52.960 --> 47:54.960
Caution I would use.

47:54.960 --> 48:00.960
Dear Unicorn, you have been the greatest friend to me, and a kindred spirit indeed.

48:00.960 --> 48:02.960
Shall I back away from the light?

48:02.960 --> 48:07.960
Nay, thou must seek thine own destiny, the danger with naught.

48:07.960 --> 48:11.960
Oh, you are like a rock covered in candy, hard and sweet.

48:11.960 --> 48:20.960
You are like Sammy Hagar, and canst not thou drive fifty-five.

48:20.960 --> 48:22.960
The embermall approaches.

48:22.960 --> 48:26.960
Shall you face it head on, or shall you lay an ambush?

48:26.960 --> 48:30.960
I am an elf human.

48:30.960 --> 48:34.960
Sharpie, you are titular leader of this group of headless worms?

48:34.960 --> 48:38.960
I am behind a rock.

48:38.960 --> 48:40.960
I call back to Sharpie for advice.

48:40.960 --> 48:41.960
Sharpie!

48:41.960 --> 48:46.960
Get behind a rock!

48:46.960 --> 48:51.960
Go straight at him!

48:51.960 --> 48:52.960
Just do it!

48:52.960 --> 48:56.960
A fuck of cluster this be.

48:56.960 --> 48:59.960
Aren't there no leaders amongst this group?

48:59.960 --> 49:03.960
If it's me, everyone's behind a rock.

49:03.960 --> 49:05.960
Hey, Muldane, don't you have arrows?

49:05.960 --> 49:07.960
Fire a couple of those off.

49:07.960 --> 49:09.960
Dum-dum.

49:09.960 --> 49:11.960
Thank you.

49:11.960 --> 49:13.960
Thank you, sir, I shall not take dum-dum personally.

49:13.960 --> 49:19.960
I fire off fourteen arrows.

49:19.960 --> 49:23.960
All right, well, you can only fire off a couple at a time.

49:23.960 --> 49:29.960
Well, I fire off two, and then two, and then two, and then two, and then two, and then two, and then two.

49:29.960 --> 49:31.960
Fourteen.

49:31.960 --> 49:35.960
Seven times has she let her bow sing against the air.

49:35.960 --> 49:40.960
If she's doing that, I hide behind a rock seven times.

49:40.960 --> 49:46.960
Seven times has thou coward like a gerbil's garbles.

49:46.960 --> 49:51.960
Also, I put a bedroll on my head.

49:51.960 --> 49:57.960
Unable to see, you fire an arrow wildly.

49:57.960 --> 50:02.960
It flies past quark and lands harmlessly in the ash dirt.

50:02.960 --> 50:04.960
Oh, man.

50:04.960 --> 50:06.960
The ember moller draws closer.

50:06.960 --> 50:11.960
It seems to see that you're there firing arrows with a bedroll on your head.

50:11.960 --> 50:14.960
I jump out from behind the rock. I have the power to intimidate, do I not?

50:14.960 --> 50:17.960
You do, but this is a fearsome beast.

50:17.960 --> 50:22.960
I get back behind the rock.

50:22.960 --> 50:24.960
I had a rush of blood to the head.

50:24.960 --> 50:29.960
Your intimidation does not last very long, and you are soon quickly found behind the rock again.

50:29.960 --> 50:38.960
I present a torch to see what the, with the green fire light.

50:38.960 --> 50:41.960
Did I say this is a dream?

50:41.960 --> 50:43.960
I thought you did.

50:43.960 --> 50:44.960
I don't think I did, sorry.

50:44.960 --> 50:48.960
Well, the elf human's mind is imaginative.

50:48.960 --> 50:50.960
Also, it's my birthday party.

50:50.960 --> 50:55.960
Sorry, Moldane. Spencer, I have a check mark behind the skill to handle animal.

50:55.960 --> 50:58.960
Yeah, this is a magical creature. It doesn't work like an animal.

50:58.960 --> 51:01.960
Sorry, back behind the rock I go.

51:01.960 --> 51:03.960
Sorry, guys.

51:03.960 --> 51:05.960
I dropped my wallet over there.

51:05.960 --> 51:10.960
You hear a ferocious roar and a burst of superheated air rushes past the rock.

51:10.960 --> 51:12.960
You can tell that it's very close.

51:12.960 --> 51:16.960
Jesus Christ, wait, is it targeting us?

51:16.960 --> 51:18.960
Yeah, it's coming towards you.

51:18.960 --> 51:20.960
Oh, man.

51:20.960 --> 51:22.960
Sharpey, use your magic, man.

51:22.960 --> 51:26.960
I'm a barbarian gnome. I got a sword and a backpack.

51:26.960 --> 51:30.960
I needed to wait until a point when there was no choice but to fight.

51:30.960 --> 51:35.960
Look, we've all had some drinks. Could everyone stop bitching at one another?

51:35.960 --> 51:39.960
Listen, you're a horse. I've been walking in your poop for the last 45 minutes, man.

51:39.960 --> 51:42.960
My plume is my glory.

51:42.960 --> 51:44.960
I said poop.

51:44.960 --> 51:45.960
My what?

51:45.960 --> 51:46.960
Your poop.

51:46.960 --> 51:48.960
Your talking.

51:48.960 --> 51:50.960
Small dwarf-like thing.

51:50.960 --> 51:53.960
I cast Summon Monster.

51:53.960 --> 51:59.960
Alright, what monster would you like to summon? Like a orangutan or a spectral dog?

51:59.960 --> 52:02.960
An orangutan is a monster?

52:02.960 --> 52:05.960
Look, I bought a zoo last year.

52:05.960 --> 52:09.960
I summon an orangutan.

52:09.960 --> 52:12.960
A green monkey springs into existence.

52:12.960 --> 52:16.960
It charges out from around the rock and engages-

52:16.960 --> 52:18.960
You said green, right?

52:18.960 --> 52:22.960
No, it wasn't green. Where'd you get this from?

52:22.960 --> 52:24.960
Let me get this straight.

52:24.960 --> 52:26.960
An orangutan charges around the rock.

52:26.960 --> 52:29.960
Guys, just take it easy. This is all going to solve itself.

52:29.960 --> 52:34.960
I summoned an orangutan. It'll be fine. Just give it a second.

52:34.960 --> 52:36.960
Okay.

52:36.960 --> 52:38.960
You summoned an orangutan.

52:38.960 --> 52:41.960
I detect evil.

52:41.960 --> 52:44.960
My hero.

52:44.960 --> 52:46.960
You detect evil on the other side of the rock.

52:46.960 --> 52:51.960
You hear the shrieks of an orangutan being dismembered.

52:51.960 --> 52:52.960
Alright.

52:52.960 --> 52:55.960
Way to go, hot shot.

52:55.960 --> 52:58.960
There's a method to my madness.

52:58.960 --> 53:01.960
What an unwholesome smell.

53:01.960 --> 53:04.960
Like bananas and burning petrol.

53:04.960 --> 53:07.960
May I summon a magical beast?

53:07.960 --> 53:09.960
No, you don't have spells.

53:09.960 --> 53:12.960
Why don't we utilize this unicorn that's been following us around the whole time?

53:12.960 --> 53:14.960
I have a spell that I might cast.

53:14.960 --> 53:17.960
I will make a magic circle against evil.

53:17.960 --> 53:20.960
You create a magic circle around yourself.

53:20.960 --> 53:27.960
I will use urine and whirl my member in a helicopter-like motion

53:27.960 --> 53:32.960
in an anachronistic movement that has not heath or two yet been seen.

53:32.960 --> 53:42.960
Now, no evil may enter this circle of urine and I apologize for the dampness.

53:42.960 --> 53:47.960
Here's a sponge with my likeness upon it that you may purchase for a very small fee.

53:47.960 --> 53:50.960
I don't know if good can enter this circle either.

53:50.960 --> 53:53.960
It's a bunch of horse pee.

53:53.960 --> 53:55.960
Unicorn.

53:55.960 --> 53:59.960
It's like being at a Gallagher show.

53:59.960 --> 54:04.960
All right, so we're surrounded by an arc of urine.

54:04.960 --> 54:06.960
The urine steams on the ground.

54:06.960 --> 54:15.960
The embermolar waltzes across towards you, but it seems stopped by this circle in the ground.

54:15.960 --> 54:19.960
He is most gay and yet he stands frozen.

54:19.960 --> 54:23.960
See, I told you, unicorns always have one.

54:23.960 --> 54:32.960
The embermolar whips its fiery tail and an arc of fire shoots past the barrier right towards Sharpie.

54:32.960 --> 54:35.960
Sweet fucking Maria.

54:35.960 --> 54:40.960
I throw my backpack.

54:40.960 --> 54:46.960
Throwing your backpack, it catches flames and intercepts the attack.

54:46.960 --> 54:47.960
Oh, thank you.

54:47.960 --> 54:48.960
Oh, it intercepts the attack?

54:48.960 --> 54:49.960
Yeah, it does.

54:49.960 --> 54:50.960
This time.

54:50.960 --> 54:51.960
All right.

54:51.960 --> 54:53.960
Only had one backpack.

54:53.960 --> 54:57.960
Your backpack burns and its contents are subsumed by fire.

54:57.960 --> 55:00.960
How formidable this backpack was.

55:00.960 --> 55:01.960
All right, ray of frost.

55:01.960 --> 55:08.960
You cast ray of frost, a blinding blue light streams from your fingers directly into the face of the embermolar.

55:08.960 --> 55:11.960
As a cold spell, it does extra damage.

55:11.960 --> 55:12.960
Ooh.

55:12.960 --> 55:13.960
Ooh.

55:13.960 --> 55:17.960
I wonder, I follow up the attack with a berserker rage with my sword.

55:17.960 --> 55:20.960
The cold damage does two damage.

55:20.960 --> 55:24.960
The spell does two damage to the embermolar.

55:24.960 --> 55:26.960
It recoils in pain.

55:26.960 --> 55:31.960
I follow up the attack by congratulating Sharpie, for I care for him the most.

55:31.960 --> 55:40.960
As the congratulations unfurl, Quark unsheathes his blade and charges across the barrier of urine at the embermolar.

55:40.960 --> 55:47.960
He slices a mighty blow and hits it right in the flank.

55:47.960 --> 55:53.960
He feels the heat off the embermolars hide, but he can tell that it's been wounded.

55:53.960 --> 55:56.960
It takes how much damage?

55:56.960 --> 55:58.960
Seven damage.

55:58.960 --> 56:00.960
How much damage do I take?

56:00.960 --> 56:04.960
You take two damage because of the fire on your hands.

56:04.960 --> 56:06.960
You're not wearing gloves or any protective equipment.

56:06.960 --> 56:08.960
I have the power to cure light wounds.

56:08.960 --> 56:11.960
Oh, is that inappropriate of this structure?

56:11.960 --> 56:14.960
Would you like to cure those white wounds?

56:14.960 --> 56:16.960
Whose wounds are we curing?

56:16.960 --> 56:18.960
Quark, the gnome.

56:18.960 --> 56:27.960
Although we have had our disagreements in the past, for he is short and barbaric, and I am lithe, white and desirable.

56:27.960 --> 56:32.960
I live in a basket of green flowers and promises of butterscotch dons.

56:32.960 --> 56:37.960
He comes from a place of dark green gangrenous swords that are pulled from hideous scabbards.

56:37.960 --> 56:40.960
Hey, my hands are burning over here, man.

56:40.960 --> 56:48.960
I will lay my healing powers upon him so that he may know the power of the unicorn.

56:48.960 --> 56:56.960
While he's laying his healing powers, I lovingly comb the hair of the unicorn, and he loves it.

56:56.960 --> 57:00.960
I wonder, might you braid me if it's not too gay at this juncture?

57:00.960 --> 57:04.960
Hey, Muldane, get in the fight.

57:04.960 --> 57:06.960
Shoot an arrow.

57:06.960 --> 57:08.960
I shot 14 arrows.

57:08.960 --> 57:12.960
Well, everyone, shut up. I'm getting a permanent.

57:12.960 --> 57:16.960
A fight's going on. You're combing everybody's hair and you're complimenting people.

57:16.960 --> 57:22.960
That certain arrow stopped warfare in the merry old land of Oz.

57:22.960 --> 57:24.960
You know what, unicorn?

57:24.960 --> 57:26.960
I only shot a couple arrows.

57:26.960 --> 57:29.960
Can I shoot the rest of the arrow?

57:29.960 --> 57:32.960
You can shoot one arrow, yes.

57:32.960 --> 57:35.960
Well, fine, Spencer. Shoot an arrow.

57:35.960 --> 57:41.960
If you shoot firing an arrow from your bow, you hit the lion straight in the face.

57:41.960 --> 57:47.960
The arrow burns, but it is punctured deeply.

57:47.960 --> 57:55.960
Who broke my heart? You did, you did, straight to the target, and nobody.

57:55.960 --> 58:00.960
I shoot another arrow through my heart.

58:00.960 --> 58:03.960
Spencer, with throwing knives, you're any good? Probably not, right?

58:03.960 --> 58:05.960
It is the Ember Mahler's turn.

58:05.960 --> 58:07.960
Sorry.

58:07.960 --> 58:14.960
Circling around the circle of urine, the Ember Mahler tries to find a weakness.

58:14.960 --> 58:21.960
He scratches at the dirt and some ash slides over the circle of urine, breaking the magic circle.

58:21.960 --> 58:23.960
Oh, shit. Breach.

58:23.960 --> 58:26.960
The Ember Meier roars.

58:26.960 --> 58:30.960
We got Ember Mahler's in the wire. Ember Mahler's in the wire.

58:30.960 --> 58:36.960
I had no idea how tentative my circle of urine was when I weighed it.

58:36.960 --> 58:39.960
I don't know if you guys would keep a score, but I just got my ass kicked over there.

58:39.960 --> 58:41.960
Assholes and elbows.

58:41.960 --> 58:49.960
The Ember Mahler makes a great swipe edge at Quark's face with a giant flaming claw.

58:49.960 --> 58:52.960
It hits you square in the face.

58:52.960 --> 58:55.960
Quark!

58:55.960 --> 58:57.960
Oh, Troll, who I have disagreed with.

58:57.960 --> 59:00.960
He's a gnome, you bitch.

59:00.960 --> 59:05.960
You may gnome, but I just met him.

59:05.960 --> 59:16.960
This unicorn's killing you.

59:16.960 --> 59:20.960
I'm gonna die over here, I know it.

59:20.960 --> 59:22.960
Take it easy, man, take it easy.

59:22.960 --> 59:35.580
to, I have the power to cure moderate wounds. Your face, I will sit upon and let my magic

59:35.580 --> 59:45.000
juices flow, and thus will you be re-appared back to look like Elly May from the Clampett

59:45.000 --> 01:00:00.000
family. In a possibly not official rage, I cast Magic Missile. Thank you, man. A lot

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:06.000
of fans here. As the unicorn is healing the gnome, your Magic Missile loses forth and

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:14.760
hits the ember wall. And this is like a romantic, you can see the trembling in my blushing cheeks.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:24.360
There's something going on. There is an homosexual ecstasy in his fighting. The Missile is bright

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:33.920
red with rage. And yet the sperm count is so low. I am sitting on your face as fast as

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:44.520
I can. The Missile strikes the ember muller for four damage. Sweet. Are you...

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:50.680
In later levels, I'll be much more powerful. I use my whip. All right. Pulling the whip

01:00:50.680 --> 01:01:00.800
from your back pocket. It's an actual back pocket. Okay. What? I don't know what's happening,

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:06.000
you guys. I'm trying to DM. I don't know. Does she have a whip? Yes, she has a whip. She's

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.080
got a whip. She has two magical... She's also got like five backpacks. For all you people

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.000
who actually care about Dungeons and Dragons, Quall's Feather Token is a magic item that

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:24.000
can turn into a magical whip. And your mom is calling right now. It's time for dinner.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:33.080
Mom! I'm with my friends. I don't bring the hot pockets down here. All right. You can

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:38.240
have them down here once, but you've got to keep it more quiet. I make eye contact with

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:43.240
Quark, making sure that things are cool between us. Quark's eyes are blocked by the ass of

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:53.440
a large unicorn. My white flanks. My white flanks will issue their healing serum upon

01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:03.160
your visage. Can you not feel? I'll tell you what, Talonel. If I had a nickel. You would

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:13.280
have five cents. Note to self, never have matter it wounds. Note to self, always do

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:21.640
Johnny Carson. I gotta say, I'm feeling pretty good down here. Of course. What issues from

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:28.800
me can only make one feel better? I am Tylenol with Cody Ann. Hey guys! I got a unicorn's

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:34.920
ass on my head right now, but did you guys kill that embryo yet? Not yet. It has like

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:42.920
30 hit points, clearly. Keep using plosives. It feels awesome. Tylenol with Cody, be there

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:50.520
any magic in your horn? I beg pardon. In my own world I was for but a moment. What is

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:59.280
it, Elflit? I was hoping that you had magic in your horn. Indeed, my horn is spoken of

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.920
in many lands and doth thus quake at the very thought of my horn, filling one. You know

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:10.120
what, while I'm hearing, as he says that Spencer, I look at my sheet and I'd like to just handle

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:18.600
animal again. I am not an animal. I am a being from beyond your imagination whose power cannot

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:24.880
contain your paltry fucking thoughts. Oh, good know me. Yeah, I just rolled the dice and

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.600
he rolled better than you, so you didn't handle him successfully. There's a fucking monster!

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:37.720
This is Dick Cabot? What the? The Embermawler pounces on Mulraine Sedona. No! Wait, who pounced

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:45.720
on him? The Embermawler. Oh, I got it! It's been here for a while. Help! Guys, let's just

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:57.280
wait him out. Good idea, Genome. Oh, guys, come on. I have a piercing horn. Now that

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:02.840
you have mentioned it, oh, Elflit, see it here upon this piece of paper handed to me

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:12.400
by Yon Magician. I may attack with my horn and I bid you all good day. Though I may die

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:20.120
against the Elfamore. What's it called? The Embermawler. Him too. Both of them will tax

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:26.480
my bravery to the utmost and yet I bid you adieu. Oh, Genome, my flanks say much thanks

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:32.240
to you. Oh, Sharpie, the courage I hope you may find within and Elflit, I leave my heart

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:38.400
with you. Indeed, literally, here it is. It's in a small baggie made of Ziploc. And now

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:45.680
I will hardly fuck off and pierce this Embermawler with my horn. As the Embermawler is pouncing

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:50.080
on Mulraine Sedona. Someone in the front was yawning copiously right now. I just want

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:57.040
you to know that my monologue was like fucking... The unicorn plunges its horn deep within

01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:12.600
the flank of the Embermawler. Zorch. Dealing 16 damage to the Embermawler. Unicorns are

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:18.200
powerful magical creatures, you guys. I told you. Tell me about it. He's been sitting on

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:29.640
my head for the last half hour. Call me. The Embermawler wobbles a bit and then falls over,

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.640
flaming blood spews out of its side and sprays... I cast magic missile on it to claim credit

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:41.440
for the kill. Before it hits the ground, your magic missile strikes true. You successfully

01:05:41.440 --> 01:06:11.240
take credit for the kill. And Romney takes Ohio. Is everybody okay? I'm not certain.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:17.920
Should we take stock of what happens now? We got a dead Embermawler around. Let's check

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:23.840
it out. Make sure it's dead. As you poke it, its body bursts into flames and is reduced

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:29.440
to ashes. Only a bone lower jaw remains. Somebody better take that. It might be worth something.

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:37.640
I shall make it a necklace to bring with us on all our adventures that I will be on.

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:46.760
I remain. Well, there was a reward for this posted at the Tavern back in Cockville.

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:57.640
Chachow Lounge. Am I dead? No, you're still alive. Unless you want to be dead. No, Unicorn.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:03.560
Only your career has died. I must leave you after this episode, unlike the Elflet who will

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:13.520
stay until time is immeasurable. No, Unicorn. Take her away with you. I cannot. Many tasks

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:19.760
must I perform for those who rule the seventh outermost circle. I wish you much luck, Sharpie,

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:26.000
in taking credit for kills in the future. Do you have to leave, fair Unicorn? Fuck off,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:33.080
I must, for appetizers are served at happy hour at the Unicorn Applebee's outside of

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:41.120
my town, where life is good. Unicorn, please take one of my arrows to remember me by. Do

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:46.760
with it what you wish. I will take one of your arrows. Bray it in my mane, if you will,

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:52.840
Elflet. I thank you. Of course, sir. And you, Genome, many hours have I sat upon your face

01:07:52.840 --> 01:08:02.640
and much memory have I had. For you are like Susie Chopstick, your lips are everlasting.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.000
Fuck off, I must, and let my cheeks break wind.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:14.160
Wow, look, he's leaving a rainbow trail as he flies away. Haha, it's just a dream.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:27.480
You can hear him singing. Does he sing? Does he sing Word Up? Wait, that was no Unicorn,

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:39.520
that was Morris Day, the entire time. I miss you, Morris Day. It wasn't Morris Day, it

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:45.800
was Cameo. Cameo, fuck, I screwed it. It was Cameo!

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:52.200
By the seven moons of Cameo. Let us reflect on how this team of three watched that Unicorn

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:58.960
dancing into the sunset. Two and a half. I think we've, I think we've learned a lot

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:07.200
in this adventure. We've learned to get along. We've learned to hide behind rocks. I've learned

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:15.720
that Morris Day is not Cameo. That's about it, but we should head back to that town

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.720
that I keep forgetting the name of. Thornvale.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:24.400
Thornvale. Returning to Thornvale, you meet with Ferris of the Wardens. His name was on

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:30.600
the bill to kill the Embermuller. He's at the Wardens' quarters.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:39.680
I am Ferris, and I am mildly disgruntled. Well, your disgruntlement is going to stop

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:48.800
when you find out what we just did. Kill the Embermuller, motherfucker!

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:55.760
Who is this jive honky? This is one of my best friends. He's a, he's

01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:02.800
a gnome, barbarian. No Expedio wish I to use this day.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:07.400
We have just come back from slaying the Embermuller.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.120
Dost thou shit me?

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:15.240
Health, show him the jawbone to prove the point. She's wearing it as a necklace.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:21.760
I am, and again, I am a man, though I am beautiful, and appear to be a woman. Here is the jawbone.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:27.680
Your male beauty is so overpowering. But a semi I did get.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.160
Thank you, Ferris. Do you wish to lead a parade through Chicago?

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:36.760
Indeed. And I wish to congratulate you, Sharpie, though earlier I was disgruntled alone in

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:42.480
this tavern drinking my ale. Thou hast slain the Embermuller.

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:49.320
Him who has brought evil upon this land. And I am to give thee this flaggan.

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:57.320
I take the flaggan. And this bag of riches.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:01.320
That's better. 1,400 gold pieces, to be exact.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:08.320
1,397, but who is counting? There is vigorous to be paid in this town.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:13.320
Quirk, I would like to tell you this is money. Do not try to eat the money.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:17.320
The coins are made of gold and chocolate.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.320
I eat the chocolate.

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:28.320
All right, that's the end of our D&D campaign chapter.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:34.320
Thank you, Erin McGathy, for playing the part of Mordred Humpstallot.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:40.320
Morgan Humpstallot, Morgan Sultana.

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.320
I'll make a cheat sheet.

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:46.320
Just call me MS.

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.320
One step ahead of you.

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:58.320
Erin McGathy, everybody!

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.320
And Spencer, everybody, our Dungeon Master, of course.

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:11.320
What a hero.

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:17.320
So, how about that Romney? Wow.

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.320
He's all different than the other candidate.

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.320
I met Greg for drinks at before the show, and I said,

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.320
is there anything you want to talk about? He said, just no politics.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.320
Not because he's not a political person, quite the contrary,

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:36.320
because you must be like a...

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:40.320
He has a podcast of his own, and so he's either exhausted from the previous one

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.320
at this time of year, or gearing up for another screed.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:47.320
Greg, if you could, like, a la Dungeons and Dragons,

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:53.320
create a presidential candidate, like a mystical character.

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:55.320
What would your presidential candidate be?

01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:01.320
First, his power would be fudge, because no one doesn't like fudge.

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:06.320
Secondly, he would raise the dark cloud that has been visited upon this land

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:12.320
and replace it with one of menthol, so that we could all breathe freely.

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:17.320
Thirdly, those who are in want would suddenly have the succor that they need

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:23.320
and would be able to drink from a cornucopia of delicious peach-scented beverages

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.320
that would provide all the nutrients they needed.

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:30.320
And lastly, healthcare.

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.320
That's separate from succor.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.320
Oh, no, succor is delicious, but it's not healthcare.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.320
Universal succor we will all receive.

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:42.320
Wouldn't that be great of a candidate for a promised universal succor?

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:45.320
He just dodged the issue then. Everyone would want to talk about healthcare,

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:49.320
but he's like, no, no, succor, that you get.

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:53.320
He just kind of threaded that needle in one.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:55.320
Succor is fine.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:58.320
I'm not saying we should socialize medicine.

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:02.320
I'm saying we should socialize succor.

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:06.320
You're promising fudge, succor, and the pursuit of happiness.

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:11.320
I think the pursuit of happiness is misleading because there's no consensus on happiness.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.320
Some people are happy when they're shooting people in the face.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:18.320
Exactly. If you're a Republican, if there's a bunch of ugly people in a room screaming and shit,

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.320
you're like, fuck, this is awesome.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.320
And then if you're not, you're like, fuck, this is scary.

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:25.320
So that's where I come down.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.320
This crowd, of course, has been living on D&D and comic books,

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.320
so they don't know what I'm talking about.

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.320
There's an election this year.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:35.320
That's where politics is really complicated, though,

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:39.320
is the basic fact that as primates, we all just want each other to like each other.

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:46.320
And so sometimes it's very easy to just say, hey, whatever makes you happy.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:51.320
And then sometimes we have a very simple answer for exactly what we want,

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.320
and what makes us happy.

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:57.320
And then sometimes the line gets very thin or very wide and very blurry

01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:00.320
because what we really want is for everybody to like us.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:06.320
And so sometimes the way you get people to like you is by being unhappy, for instance.

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:12.320
We all have friends in this room who are a little more comfortable, depressed,

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.320
than they are joyful.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.320
Sometimes I feel that way.

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:21.320
You know, this kind of Munchausen syndrome where you're like, ah, you know,

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:25.320
it could be better, and you feel the love come in, and that's how you get it.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:29.320
And I mean, obviously, it's weird because we're monkeys.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.320
Monkeys just want monkeys to...

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:36.320
The only thing that we know for sure is that monkeys don't want to be alone.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:39.320
That's the one thing that you can guarantee.

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.320
I think I've ranted about this before.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:45.320
I saw this documentary about solitary confinement where they're, you know,

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:49.320
like the most hard-ass fuckers that eat people.

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:56.320
They're the most sociopathic, amoral, dysfunctional people.

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.320
But you put them in solitary confinement,

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:03.320
and they immediately act exactly the same way that your dad would act in solitary confinement,

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:06.320
or anybody, or Mr. Rogers or Captain Kangaroo.

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.320
They all act equally tortured and insane because being cut off from all other people

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:15.320
is the only common denominator there is.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:18.320
None of us can handle it.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.320
There are all the different things that can go wrong with the human brain.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:25.320
There is no thing, there's no balloon animal you can twist in your skull

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.320
that makes a human being get into being alone.

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:33.320
And we're talking about a world where there's people who like to have shits taken on them.

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:36.320
And they smile while it's happening.

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.320
They're like, that's great. Would you have chili?

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.320
That's fantastic.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:44.320
But those people, along with everybody else, if you shut them off from society,

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:47.320
if you send them off into the woods and say that they're dead to you,

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:54.320
they will suffer the same pain as Jeffrey Dahmer and Bill Clinton and Mr. Rogers and anybody.

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:59.320
And while that's the only thing, I think, can we start with that and go,

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:03.320
okay, if that's the case, then we have something to go on here.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:08.320
We have like a close encounter that we can build a language off of.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.320
That's our tatanka is the idea.

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:14.320
Hey, you guy with the feathers coming out of your thing,

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.320
you pierced your cheek and you don't speak the same language as me

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.320
and you have a completely different language.

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:22.320
We all agree, like, you hate it when you're alone, right?

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.320
Yeah, I hate it when I'm alone, too.

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:25.320
What's the scariest thing in the world?

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.320
Your mom saying peek-a-boo but never coming back.

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.320
Yeah, that's what everybody's afraid of.

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:33.320
It's like, mom covers her face and then her face disappears.

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:37.320
And the first laugh you get is she goes peek-a-boo and she's back and so you laugh.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.320
But like, god damn it.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.320
Well, what was my point?

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.320
Mitt Romney shouldn't probably be president.

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.320
Yeah, he shouldn't probably be president.

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:51.320
Like, because like you said, there are people in the world

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:55.320
who are going to be in a room full of horrible, disgusting, nasty people

01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:00.320
shouting, cut off his head and money's better and drill baby drill

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.320
and they're going to be happy in that room.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.320
You could hook them up to a polygraph and say, are you happy?

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.320
And I think that they'd pass it.

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.320
They'd go like, yeah, yeah, I'm feeling good.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.320
Feeling good tonight.

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:15.320
But like, so there's got to be a way to...

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.320
I got nothing.

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.320
I don't know.

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:20.320
There's got to be a way to take them through that all the way into it.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.320
Yeah, but then there's no people.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.320
Then you're alone.

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.320
Wouldn't that make you sad?

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.320
And then they would fail that polygraph test.

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:30.320
They wouldn't go, yeah, I'm having a good time hearing an island by myself.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.320
Because that's the peak of capitalism too.

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.320
Like, that's what you do.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.320
Your house gets bigger, your yard gets bigger.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.320
The barbed wire gets taller.

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:43.320
The richer you are, the more allowed you are to just go up to Xanadu

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.320
and just hang out and not talk to anybody.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.320
And be alone.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.320
Yeah, and those people go fucking nuts.

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.320
And then they run for president.

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:55.320
But anyways, Greg didn't want to talk about politics tonight,

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:59.320
but a couple of weeks ago I did a little screed and it wasn't really...

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.320
I'm the laziest brain guy in the world and I did a little screed about politics

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.320
and it was about the idea that...

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.320
I referred to Osama, Obama.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.320
I did the same thing.

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.320
We'll edit it out.

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:16.320
Wow.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.320
Their names are similar.

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.320
There's one letter.

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.320
I referred to the choice between...

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:27.320
Obama and Romney is the choice between Diet Pepsi and Piss.

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:31.320
Neither of them is water.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.320
Neither of them is what you need.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:40.320
But I ended that rant on a base that makes some of these 25-year-olds

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.320
think that I was like a libertarian or something,

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:46.320
which is not that either.

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.320
That's not it.

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:51.320
I'm just a big, fat, lazy, tired, sad, cynical fucker.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:56.320
And every four years I go and I pull the lever for the Democratic candidate

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.320
just because I don't want to be part of anything bad that happens.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:03.320
But I resent the fact that that's why I'm pulling a lever

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:06.320
and I resent the implication that that's an act of revolution because it's not.

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:09.320
And nothing's ever going to change as long as we keep being convinced

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:13.320
that that revolution happens behind a curtain booth.

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:16.320
That's a scam in itself that we're buying.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.320
I think that things need to change a little more.

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:22.320
I read that Al Gore is getting into...

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:25.320
He's actually coming out and saying,

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:29.320
fuck the Electoral College, we have to change it completely, right?

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:30.320
We have to drop it.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:33.320
12 years after the fact, but yes, he does.

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:36.320
If he'd said it in 2000, it might have been a different story.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:40.320
We're taking it with a grain of salt, Al Gore.

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:43.320
He also likes massages quite a lot, is my understanding.

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:46.320
Yeah, poor guy.

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:51.320
I remember the teachers in my school that all the students liked.

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:54.320
They're always the ones that ended up getting in trouble for...

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.320
Smoking dope with them, yeah.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.320
There's always the big problem.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:03.320
The brush-cutted guy, the economics teacher and gym coach,

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:06.320
he never colored outside the lines.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:11.320
No, it was the language arts teacher who smoked hot pot with the girls who got in trouble.

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.320
But he would put your head through a window.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.320
He would go nuts.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:18.320
He didn't call you by your last name.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.320
Fascism.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:23.320
Sometimes it's the simpler choice.

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:26.320
Fascism. The simpler choice.

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:29.320
Stop thinking about it. Join us.

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:33.320
It's easy to march. It's hard to walk to your own beat.

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:41.320
We've had a rash of not knowing how to end the show's last couple of shows.

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.320
Is this one of those?

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.320
Sure.

01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:46.320
Well, if you're asking if I know how to end the show...

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.320
You're talking to the wrong person, man.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.320
You've never seen one. You don't know what...

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:55.320
But I'm unloquacious within Garryless, so I don't know how to end a fucking show.

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.320
Start talking more.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.320
We could probably do a...

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.320
Well, yeah, I can't talk.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:09.320
I'm not going to get started on politics, but I would be happy to end with a patented proof screed.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.320
Gee, that's terrific.

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.320
Just do one.

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.320
Do one about crackers.

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.320
You like crackers?

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.320
There's a new statement called, great proofs is on the spot.

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:23.320
The thing about crackers is...

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:27.320
I mean, there's the Stan Wheat Thins, but like after the first bite, you're like,

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:30.320
this could really use some peanut butter or some butter or whatnot.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.320
Because Stan Wheat Thins are a bit like pretzels.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.320
The first bite, you're like, I don't think I'm going to be able to breathe again.

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:37.320
There's kind of a windpipe blockage thing.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:41.320
I like rits, and I like the little ones as well.

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:45.320
I do like the European ones, but when you get a whole foods and there's like a $17 one,

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:49.320
it's got like a cheese flavor, those are always weak and they fail under the fucking topping.

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.320
He really did the screen about crackers.

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.320
He did it?

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.320
Oh, you asked me to fucking jump in.

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:58.320
It's not my fault the crowd's going to stare at me like I'm fucking an oil pan.

01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.320
Well, I think they were mesmerized.

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:02.320
Greg, mesmerized or disappointed.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:05.320
Don't do that thing where you try to force the ending with the applause.

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.320
We've been through this.

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.320
I was going to say.

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:08.320
I can tell the difference.

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.320
They did.

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:10.320
They tried to end it.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:15.320
Greg, Dan, let's just keep throwing them out until they break.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:16.320
Crickets.

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.320
Crickets.

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.320
Okay.

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:19.320
Crickets.

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.320
The thing is, it's a typical game to understand.

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:26.320
I lived in England for five years and you'd watch it on TV and it's really difficult.

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.320
Like there's a batsman and a bowler.

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.320
There's umpires.

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.320
Crickets, plural.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.320
The insects.

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.320
The insects.

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:35.320
You're being an insect right now by countermanding me.

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:36.320
Norwegian fishing.

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:45.320
I don't know the first thing about Norwegian fishing, but I do know this.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:49.320
The Norwegians along with the Swiss are the only country in Europe that told the European

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.320
Union to fuck off.

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:54.320
We don't even want to join the EU because we have untold fucking riches.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:58.320
So when you go to Norway and we've been to, Jeff and I have been to Norway together and

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.320
I would say it was with a group of other comedians, but it wasn't.

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.320
Jeff and I just went as a couple.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.320
One weekend we were like, let's fucking go to Norway.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:11.320
And so Jeff wore red felt and I wore blue.

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:15.320
And we went to Stavanger, Norway, which is a beautiful place.

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.320
Oh, the fjords.

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.320
Oh, the fjord.

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.320
We laid in a pool together.

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:24.320
We ate red deer covered with logan lingonberries.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.320
I had the horse if you remember.

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.320
Yeah, Jeff had the horse, which isn't horse in Norwegian.

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.320
It's like kafunta.

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:41.320
The disappointing part about Norway is that there's rarely Chinese food.

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.320
Typical.

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.320
But the sushi.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:48.320
Oh, the sushi to fucking die for.

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:52.320
I don't know if you've ever had seal before, but the peniped sushi.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.320
No, you haven't had seal.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.320
You have not had seal.

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.320
Not the way they make it in Norway because they do a special gravy.

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:01.320
Stavanger will fuck up a seal.

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.320
It falls off the flipper.

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:06.320
Yeah, white person will fuck up a fucking seal.

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:08.320
Oh, it's just...

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.320
You can taste the herring.

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.320
You know what I mean?

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:16.320
It's off the boat is what it is.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.320
It's fully off the boat.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.320
It's on the hook and off the boat.

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.320
What's Jeff's favorite show? Deep Sea Fishing?

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.320
What's your favorite fucking?

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.320
Deep Balls.

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:30.320
It's on the Hustler Channel.

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:36.320
It answers the questions from Deep Balls 8.

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:39.320
Stupid, so dumb.

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:42.320
I like Star Trek The Next Penetration.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.320
It does not take us to a level that we're like an eighth grade level.

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.320
You want to play 185? To close?

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.320
What's that?

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.320
With accents?

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:55.320
No, no, that was a comedy sports reference.

01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:00.320
Greg and I traveled the world doing low level short form improv.

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:02.320
But highly successful.

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.320
And when we were in Norway, fireworks.

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:08.320
Yeah!

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:11.320
Greg, we have the two of you.

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:15.320
We've learned from previous podcasts that I'm a great beatboxer.

01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:19.320
And we have the two of you who are professional musical improvisers.

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.320
I could lay down a beat.

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:24.320
You could get a topic. You could do a little rap.

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:27.320
It won't be the first time you close the show that way.

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.320
We'll stay good night.

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.320
Yeah, let's get out of here.

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.320
Kick the beat.

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.320
And then you'll get the suggestion over the beat.

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:37.320
Go on, G.

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.320
You are an excellent beatboxer.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:43.320
Yeah, I'm a town.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.320
In the house.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.320
Greg, what should we get for a suggestion?

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:51.320
Jeff, it's all about freestyle. Why don't you get it?

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:54.320
I'll just go from what we did tonight. Yeah, we played a little D&D.

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.320
There was a girl on stage.

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.320
Great poops was all the rage.

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.320
However, there was a little animosity.

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:04.320
Yeah, and some poposity.

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.320
It's all good down in the thing.

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:09.320
We're on the Nerd Melt on Sunset BLD.

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:14.320
Parking cars ain't no way to know which way you're going to get a ticket anyway.

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:19.320
I can't think of any better way to end the podcast than three white guys just wrapping their ass up.

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:21.320
Yo, Nerd Melt in the house.

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.320
Everybody put those hands in the air.

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:26.320
And if you like great poops, say yeah.

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:27.320
Yeah.

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.320
Say yeah.

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.320
Yeah.

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.320
And if you like Dan Harmon, say yeah.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.320
Yeah.

01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:36.320
To the J and to the E and to the F double F.

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.320
It's Jeff Davis, enough stuff, Seth.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.320
He's going all night long.

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:44.320
He's going to get you with his massive prong.

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.320
Dan Harmon, take it down.

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:48.320
Finish it off, Dan.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.320
Yeah, motherfuckers.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:25.320
Thank you, Harmontown.

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:50.320

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:01.320
Fresh.

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:04.320
One more time for the mayor of Ironman Town.

01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:08.320
Dan Harmon.

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:09.320
Awesome.

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.320

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.320
One more time for plate troops.

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:25.320

Good fun, Boniwits.

01:29:42.320 --> 01:30:08.320
Sorry.
