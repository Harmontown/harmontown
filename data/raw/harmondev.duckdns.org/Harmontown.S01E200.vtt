{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:18.000\nHollywood, California, The Nerdmelt Theater, and Meltdown Comics, the 200th Harmontown\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:43.000\nis now in session. Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden, everybody.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:50.000\nCan we bring out Rob or do we bring out Dan first?\n\n00:50.000 --> 01:10.000\nLet's bring out Dan Harmon, the mayor, and let him make that decision.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:26.000\nScoping, I got a scope in my pocket. Scoping, periscoping, millennial media, there's no bounds.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:46.000\nSouls are lost, but highways are bound to enrol. Problematization, publication, new immigration, and I'm scoping. I'm not scoping, I'm scoping, I'm scoping, I'm loping with you.\n\n01:46.000 --> 02:12.000\nPeriscope, what do you do? Periscope, Periscope, looking up to the world from the submarine of privacy, waging war on the Nazis,\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:36.000\nthe U-boats, with their stockades, I mean blockades, I mean shockade, drink the shockade. Periscope, Periscope, looking up to the Periscope, looking up.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:57.000\nPeriscope, Periscope.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:10.000\nIt's incredible. Dan, it took us 200 episodes to find out that you were a great rock and roller. We've been doing bad rap for a long time now.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:22.000\nIt should have been Jordy White from Manson and from Perfect Circle. What else do you got? What? Let's do our 200th episode theme.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:27.000\nAlright, so you got something a little slower, a little more ballady.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:34.000\nI usually ask our friends to make music for us for it to be a little bit more driven. Let me see here.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:52.000\nThis is by Johnny Polanski, good friend. Is that going to work for you?\n\n03:52.000 --> 04:04.000\nIs that going to work? Yeah, you can just keep holding it like that.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:10.000\nThe thing is, our friend Titanic and our friend Jordy, they have all kinds of slow music I didn't put on there because I never use it.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:16.000\nEpisode 201, no I'll be in London, but episode 203.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:22.000\nRemember how great episode 199 was? We're covered.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:26.000\nWas I here? Yeah, I was here.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:34.000\nIsn't it weird because it feels like you're showing people things, but you're filming them. It makes you feel like you're a game show hostess.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:41.000\nYou just turned a woman in the front row into your creepy webcam lady.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:46.000\nYeah, you have a look of utter distaste in your face right now.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:51.000\nAlright, so we'll sing the 200th episode song later.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:56.000\nAlright, well let's talk about...\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:04.000\nAlright, we're going to stop Periscope down because you can watch us at Harmontown.com live for free.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:09.000\nIt says please don't stop this.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:12.000\nDon't listen to them.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:16.000\nBut now that they're going to be typing and they know that you're not going to be listening.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:22.000\nBut they're all talking to each other, they're all seeing it, right? Are they all seeing each other's scopes?\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:25.000\nThese people are just hardcore periscope fans.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:30.000\nI've never seen this before in my life, I'm kind of excited.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:35.000\nHey, NT, how's it going? We're NT right in the front row, Hammer.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:39.000\nYeah, that's some 200 episode shit right there.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nIs that going to be upside down now?\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nIt'll be fine.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:47.000\nThere, now stop complaining.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:52.000\nDon't these periscope people know that tonight is the only time it's free to watch the live stream?\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:57.000\nThey love periscope! You don't try to dictate how people see stuff.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:00.000\nThat's why people have failed to monetize the internet. You don't understand.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:05.000\nBut Shroff, if you love bacon, go to the pig.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nYou don't just...\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:23.000\nWhat if Schrab never actually came out on stage?\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:27.000\nWhat if he just stood there the whole time?\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:32.000\nThose of you not watching Shroff is lurking, he's buttoning his shirt, he puts some glasses on.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:35.000\nI think he means business.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:39.000\nHe looks a little angry.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:45.000\nHe looks like he might be... is there something in his mouth?\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\nHe's rolling his sleeves up.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:53.000\nAgain, we're making podcast history with all this visual gags.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:58.000\nAlright. He only rolled once, leave him!\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:06.000\nWell, come up and sit down then, I guess.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:09.000\nI'll stand!\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:13.000\nThe people behind you paid ten dollars.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:17.000\nTo look at my ass.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:20.000\nI'm going to sit next to a fence.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:25.000\nLet's get another chair.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:30.000\nI feel a little embarrassed because it feels like Rob expected there to be more of a hoopla, just from seeing him.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:33.000\nSo that's why he had to just start buttoning and rolling things.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nBecause he was like, shit, what do I do?\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:38.000\nI thought standing, oh, for sure, just for appearing.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:41.000\nHe came over and he was behind the pillar, most of the crowd.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:44.000\nYou don't know what I was thinking.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nHe doesn't even have a chair.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:49.000\nNo, no, Jeff, I got this.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nYou didn't know what I was thinking.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:55.000\nEverything went exactly the way I wanted it to.\n\n07:55.000 --> 08:02.000\nExactly the way I wanted it to.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:08.000\nBut it doesn't matter because we're all in a simulation.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:14.000\nAs confirmed by Elon Musk, a hero to probably all of my listeners.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nDidn't he just say that there's a chance that we're in a simulation?\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:22.000\nNo, he said there's a very, very slim chance we're not.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:27.000\nAnd that we probably are in a thousandth simulation deep inside a simulation.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:34.000\nWe're probably one of the things a chess computer thinks it might do before it decides to make its real move.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:39.000\nWe're probably not even the actual fake artificial thing that's going to happen.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:45.000\nWe're probably a hypothetical algorithmic exploration of a possibility.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:49.000\nYou think the chess algorithm, deep blue or whatever that was,\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:53.000\nwhen he was playing whoever it was, Spassky, who did he play?\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:54.000\nSpassky.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:55.000\nIt was Kasparov.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:58.000\nIt was Kasparov.\n\n08:58.000 --> 08:59.000\nDo you think that when the computer is like,\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:02.000\nokay, I'm going to go through the motions of thinking about my next move,\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:06.000\nbut should I just tell them?\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:10.000\nYeah, I'm the more advanced.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nWhat does that change anything?\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:16.000\nHow does that change anything? I still got to go to work in the morning.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\nHow does that change anything?\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nBut it's a simulated job now.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nLike, it's nice. I think it's an improvement.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:26.000\nI would rather think of myself as entering oblivion,\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:35.000\nhaving taken part in some kind of artificial man-made or lady-made lady.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:38.000\nI mean, if they're advanced enough to simulate a universe,\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:42.000\nthere could be women working in computer science.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:46.000\nI'm just saying man-woman versus man-in-lady.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nI'm classy.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:53.000\nI may be a feminist, but I still have my charms.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:56.000\nWho wants to go for a free drink at a woman's night?\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nI'm like, I'm going to fuck you on the floor\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:03.000\nand leave with your boyfriend's Porsche feminist.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:07.000\nI'm a casino royale feminist.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:10.000\nI'm a feminist in that I will let you...\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:16.000\nrun your tears down my washboard as I emerge from the saltwater ocean\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:21.000\nwith my diamond-hard nipples poking your eyes out.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:23.000\nOur bicentennial episode, your rock and roll,\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nyou're kind of a tough kick-ass...\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:29.000\nKind of a tough-on-the-ladies feminist?\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nIt's a new thing.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nYou know who else was?\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:37.000\nBond fucking Jovey.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:41.000\nHe told them, I'm a cowboy.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:43.000\nHe didn't mean literally,\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:46.000\nhe meant I'm not going to call you back.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.000\nAnd they were like, thank you.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nBecause I'm not always just into relationships.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nSometimes I just want to fuck Bond Jovey.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:56.000\nWhy do you think he was wanted, dead or alive?\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:57.000\nWhat did he do?\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:58.000\nDid he rob a bank?\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nBecause he rides on a steel horse.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nOh, is that illegal now? The death penalty?\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:06.000\nFor riding on a steel horse?\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nShit.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nI got him back to back.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nNow those sentences, dead or alive.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nIt's not a highway, it's not road legal,\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nbut his steel horse.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nHe didn't have a helmet on.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nI think what he meant was that he's wanted,\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:24.000\nhe feels like a piece of meat.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nIt's like when John Lennon said,\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nthe way things are going, they're going to crucify me.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nIt's like when you're at the peak of your rock and roll-ness.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nBack me up, Spencer.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nAw, yeah.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:37.000\nAw, man.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nAw, shit.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nI feel bad now.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:42.000\nI feel bad.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:43.000\nI feel bad.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:44.000\nWe feel bad.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:45.000\nWe feel bad now.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nWe feel so bad.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nI don't know if you guys know the difference\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nbetween backup and interruption.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:52.000\nNo, I do.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nWe don't.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nI totally don't.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:57.000\nRight, yeah, no, we get it.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nI think he's just saying like,\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nI don't think people even care that I'm a human being.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nThat's what he means, wanted, dead or alive.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:06.000\nI think you'd want me even if this next song was bad,\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nyou know, like that is the Cobain thing.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nIt's like, I don't even know anymore.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:13.000\nI went and saw Bon Jovi a couple of times for some reason,\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nand when he came out on stage,\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:18.000\nhe came out on stage and I was sitting next to a woman\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nand her daughter, and the woman was probably like,\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:23.000\nI would say maybe late 40s.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:26.000\nAnd the daughter was, you know, 18 or 19.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nOr whatever.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:31.000\nLike, the woman was, somebody whistled,\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nthat's good.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nSo anyway, I'm fucking him.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:38.000\nAnd I mean, Dan, I mean,\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nBon Jovi style.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nOn a steel horse.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nMaybe the woman was a little bit older than that\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nand the daughter was also a little bit older\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nbecause neither of them was primetime\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nBon Jovi fan age.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nBut the daughter was there to see the band\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nbecause she heard about him,\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nbecause the 80s was coming back, you know,\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nlike for you people.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:00.000\nAnd I was talking to the mom.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:02.000\nShe's like, I didn't even know this band.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nShe plays him, she loves him.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nWhen Bon Jovi came on stage,\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:09.000\nshe was like a young girl at an Elvis concert.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nIt was just, she screamed as much as anybody there.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nThat was amazing to watch.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:16.000\nLike, whatever you like or don't like about Bon Jovi's music,\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nhe's got great blonde hair and he's got just,\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nhe's just buns.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nIt's all about buns.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nIf you haven't rock and roll Dan, great hair, buns.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nHis hair is in buns.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nIf you put his hair in more buns,\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nthat would be amazing.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nIf you put this hair in one bun.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nIs he back?\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.000\nWell, I'm a periscoper.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:42.000\nI'm going to shut you down because\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\nyou can watch it at harmontown.com live\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:46.000\nand you've probably figured out\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nhow boring the periscope could be by now.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:50.000\nThere's like five cameras on the other thing.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nStop being so sluggishly periscope-\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nSorry, audience.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nScopophiles.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nThey're admitting they're in a submarine.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.000\nThey're in a tube in the bottom of the sea.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nHow do you, oh, stop.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:06.000\nI thought you hated social media.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nShe knows how to work it?\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:10.000\nYou just don't like it.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:12.000\nShe just resents that it knows how to work her.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nYou know?\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nIt's from a societal perspective.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nIt sounded sexual.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nThis is why they went like, whoa.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.000\nHe's giving her the green light.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nBut you know what I meant.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nI meant in a David Bowie way.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nWhich is never sexual.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nWe're in a simulation.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nI think that's about it.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nThat's such bullshit, man.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nDon't scientists make fun of\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nreligious people for having ridiculous beliefs?\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nIt's so stupid.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nThere's magic people all around.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nThey get back to life.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nWhat about the gnomes?\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nWe're in a simulation,\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nbut there's no fucking gnomes.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nIf we were simulated right now,\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nwe would have some talking gnomes\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nin the backyard.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nIf we're in a simulation,\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nwe should be mad that we're in a gnomeless,\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\ndragonless simulation.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nWe got stuck in a shit simulation.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:14.000\nI think you guys should be stoked\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nthat we're in a gnomeless, dragonless simulation,\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\nbecause you know what that probably means.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nThat it's closer to reality,\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nwhich means that we're the simulation\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nthat may prove that it's possible\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nto simulate a reality\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nfrom within a simulation.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nWe could really butter our bread with this one.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nWe could be headed for the major simulation leagues.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nThey could bump us up\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nto a thumb drive\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nthat they sell in their best buys\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nin their weird alien world\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.000\nwhere women are equals.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nAll right. Our next guest...\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:46.000\nYeah, I'll take a chair.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.000\nAll right. Our next guest\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nwas peeing while we were\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.000\ntalking for the last five minutes,\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nbut right before I was going to bring him up,\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nso let's bring him out. Now, Rob Corddry's back!\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nYeah!\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nI'm going to sit\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nin a chair like a normal guest.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nYeah.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nYeah.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.000\nRob, you're taking a big liberty.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nYou're...\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nYou're exercising a liberty\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nover there.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.000\nI think Rob is such a director\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nand so completely\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nconniving and Machiavellian.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nI think he found a camera here in our mix\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nthat he really liked. I think he knows\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:36.000\nhe's being hit by Spencer's cam.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nAnd he's in a sexy two-shot at all times right now.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nI wore this red plaid.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nThat's why you entered from stage left\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nor stage right. That's the only shirt\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nI ever see you wear.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nI know. It's my default shirt.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nEither that or my default\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\njacket that goes over my default shirt.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nDo tonight feel like a default\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nshirt kind of event, Rob?\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nOur 200th episode?\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:02.000\nRob, grab a microphone.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nYes.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nOh, grab a microphone?\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\nJesus Christ.

I thought that was over.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nThat's why they kicked us out in 950\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.000\nbecause it's like, if the Goldberg's coming from this,\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nit's like, we'd rather have the snakes.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nAdam, what do you think happens after we die?\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nOh, man.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.000\nI guess we reboot.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nI don't worry about what happens after we die\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nbecause I know there was a lovely time\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\nin our history before I was alive,\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nand I figured we're just going to the other side of it.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:51.000\nI don't think we're in a matrix\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\ninside of a matrix inside of a matrix\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nbecause that just took a really good movie\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nand ended up with Morpheus\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nstabbing people with a katana\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\non top of an oil tanker.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nWell, that's just...\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:05.000\nBut we might be able to make good matrix movies\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nin 10 years.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:09.000\nIt's time for a reboot.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:11.000\nThere's so many unanswered questions in the first place.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nIf we're in a simulation,\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\ndo you think people starting to say\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nI think we're in a simulation\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\nis, A,\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nthe goal of the simulation,\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:23.000\nB, a corruption\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nof the simulation that will have to be\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:27.000\nterminated with immediate...\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nwhatever the opposite of the big bang is,\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:31.000\na big suck?\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nDo you think that it has anything\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nto do with the concept of a simulation?\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nOr is it just a byproduct?\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nIf the simulation didn't want people\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nto know it was a simulation,\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nRene Descartes would have said,\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nI think, therefore I exist,\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nand then died of a nosebleed in seconds later.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nWhy?\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nBecause he thought, oh, the only thing I can know\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nabout myself is that I exist,\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:55.000\nbecause someone has to be able to say I exist.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nAnd then he got into the idea\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nof this weird malevolent ghost\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nand therefore God exists,\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:03.000\nand then they kicked the Jews out of France.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nThat was him?\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:07.000\nNo, not...\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nIt wasn't not him.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nI think, therefore, I'm Christian.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nCareful.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nCareful.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nWhat, are they going to kick us out of NerdPel too?\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.000\nIs there a Jean-Paul Sartre in the house?\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nI was asked somebody here on hot cues.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:33.000\nDan, they still have a great question.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nLet me answer that.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nNormal.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nNo, beige?\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.000\nI would have looked this.\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:43.000\nWhat about that right

44:05.000\nHas Dan put anything in his butt\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nsince the first episode of Harmon Chow?\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nIt's a good question.\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.000\nNot really since the Sharpie\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\nthat I put in my butt.\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nThat wasn't even during Harmon Chow, right?\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nThat was a story that happened before Harmon Chow.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nWe all put something in our butt\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\na long time ago that we were just\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:23.000\ngiving that a whirl.\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\nWe didn't take it.\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nOr maybe we do.\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nYou put something up your butt and you were like,\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nthis is great.\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nYou put more stuff up your butt and you are good people too.\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nYou know that\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nGreat Proops is podcast's smartest man in the world?\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nOne of his sponsors is Me Undies.\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nWe're not getting a nickel for this.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nGreat Proops is getting all that.\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nHe's getting sweet 35 cents per click.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nAnd those Me Undies, man, when you put them on,\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nit feels like a second skin.\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:51.000\nYeah.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.000\nIt feels like a delicious manta ray\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nwrapped around your balls.\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nSave it for the actual sponsorship, man.\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\nI got a sizzling cue for you, Jeff.\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nGive me a hot cue, Adam Goldberg.\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nHow did you get associated\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nwith Lucha Vavum?\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nDid they contact you?\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\nDo you have any great stories about Lucha Doors?\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nI had a lot of great...\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:15.000\nLucha Vavum is one of the coolest things\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.000\nthat I've ever involved.\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.000\nAnd I just had mutual friends\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:21.000\nand they... Blanca Patch is a buddy of ours.\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nYeah.\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:25.000\nIt's a hilarious comedian, Blanca Patch.\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.000\nAnd he and people like Dana Gold and some other friends of ours\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nwould rotate through with him.\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nAnd I just managed somehow to kind of be\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nlike the secondary host a lot in that show.\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:35.000\nBut being...\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nWhen my friends come to the show,\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:39.000\nwhat the show is, if you don't know it,\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:41.000\nit's straight up part of Full House.\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:43.000\nFuller House.\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nLike Lucha Doors\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nand then Burlesque Triptease and Comedy and stuff like that.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nIt's very well. But two shows ago,\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:51.000\nsitting right to where I left\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nwas Morrissey. And he looked like Morrissey.\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\nHe looked bummed out the whole time.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nBecause you don't really think of Morrissey\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nas a fun time fellow. He's a creep.\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nSo he's a weirdo.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nBut he looks great, he looks like Morrissey,\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nbut a little bit older, but he still looks groovy.\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nAnd then when the first mini comes out,\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.000\nthe first little person, because some of the wrestlers are little\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nand some are quite big,\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nhe has the happiest guy in town.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nAnd I kept...\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:17.000\nBlaine and I kept sneaking over\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:19.000\nand taking selfies with ourselves and Morrissey.\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nAnd Morrissey's like...\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:23.000\nThat's all he needed.\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:25.000\nAll of Morrissey's cred was out the door.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.000\nThat's all he's been waiting for.\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:29.000\nI haven't had a dream in a long...\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:31.000\nUm...\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:33.000\nLigents!\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.000\nHa, ha, ha, ha.\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nHa, ha, ha, ha.\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nIt was great. We couldn't get over it.\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nBlaine and I are like...\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\nFrequently, when famous people come,\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nwe will say, oh, so-and-so is here.\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nYou do that Vegas thing where you say that,\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\noh, we got, you know, the guy from this band that you love\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:51.000\nand the woman that directed the movie that you love.\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nAnd we're like, do we...\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nThe woman that drank in the movie that you...\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:57.000\nDirected the movie, get the shit out of your ears.\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:59.000\nHa, ha, ha, ha.\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\nAnd I would say, don't ever interrupt,\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:03.000\nbut that's what you do.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nThe horse is out of the gate.\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nExactly.\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nNo, I feel completely lost right away.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:11.000\n200 episodes.\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:13.000\nAnd I don't even know what the fuck it was.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:15.000\nYou dressed as Jared.\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:17.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:19.000\nBlaine and I were like, do we do it?\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.000\nIt's getting towards the end of the show.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nDo we rumble Morrissey?\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nAnd then we said, hey, everybody, Morrissey.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:27.000\nThe crowd would freak out because...\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:29.000\nI don't know if you know this.\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.000\nA lot of Morrissey's fan base is very Latino,\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nespecially in Los Angeles.\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nA friend of mine in the bar was asking somebody,\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\nhe likes to come bro and he goes, dude,\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nI got five Morrissey shirts.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nThat's a real conversation that actually happens.\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:43.000\nIt's true.\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nIt really is a thing.\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:47.000\nThey're the most delightful stereotypes\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.000\nin the fucking world.\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nThat and Tweety Bird for some reason.\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:53.000\nI love stereotypes that make no sense.\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nTweety Bird and Morrissey.\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:57.000\nTweety Bird loves Morrissey.\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:59.000\nI saw Tweety Bird, he was wearing a Morrissey shirt.\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nIt's amazing.\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:03.000\nBut we're like, do we do it?\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:05.000\nIf we tell the room here\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nthat Morrissey is here,\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:09.000\nit'll be an avalanche of people.\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:11.000\nBecause, you know, he's like their main man.\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nAnd he was hiding kind of in the shadows.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:15.000\nAnd right before we were about to pull the trigger,\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nhe could just sense it and got up with his whole entourage\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nand just slipped out the side.\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:21.000\nLike, well, way to go, Morrissey.\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nReally?\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nMorrissey'd that one, didn't he?\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\nI don't belong here, said Morrissey.\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:29.000\nSlipping out.\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:31.000\nGoing out the door.\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:33.000\nI don't know what he sounds like.\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\nI've only heard Morrissey impressed.\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nI've never heard Morrissey.\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:39.000\nHis song is kind of monitoring you.\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:41.000\nI was like, oh, every song is on this note.\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:43.000\nAnd every verse is on this note.\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:45.000\nAnd remember this note.\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:47.000\nRemember this note.\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.000\nDifferent note, effect that note.\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:51.000\nThis note.\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:53.000\nEvery song is the shittiest songwriter.\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:55.000\nAnd I've listened to some Morrissey songs\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:57.000\nthat I can kind of dig.\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:59.000\nBut the problem with me and Morrissey\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:01.000\nwas I was the right age to be in high school\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:03.000\nwith people that were in the Morrissey\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:05.000\nwere just a bunch of assholes.\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:07.000\nWho's specs?\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.000\nNot like the cool high school that I have.\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nWell, now apologize to the Latino community.\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:13.000\nAnd it ruined...\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:15.000\nAnd get specific about...\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:17.000\nAnd by alcohol for?\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:19.000\nAll right, Goldberg, you got another...\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:21.000\nI got another hot quiz, some hot goss.\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:23.000\nIt's called the hot cue, man.\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:25.000\nOh,

Hey Robert\n\n01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:51.740\nRobert\n\n01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:52.740\nRobert\n\n01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.740\nGo ahead Dan\n\n01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.340\nYeah, that'd be funny, right?\n\n01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.900\nWe could still do that\n\n01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:04.960\nA lot of you're stay if you're not being if you're not\n\n01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:09.300\nFeeling it. No, but if you're quiet, you're not like\n\n01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.080\nI'm only gonna scold you when I feel like you're scaldable\n\n01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:19.000\nThank you because that that's what'll make the bit really. Thank you. Thank you\n\n01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.720\nThank you. That would be a real good idea if somebody would do that for a change\n\n01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.240\nWhen I deserve it Robert\n\n01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:28.920\nI\n\n01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.320\nYeah, see we're just testing out the bit\n\n01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:38.600\nI missed a hot cue while that was the world's best rap was going on somebody somebody pitched a mid\n\n01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.680\nWorld's best rap thing that there should have been wolves in there\n\n01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.120\nSuspenser could have come up and we'll fight during that rap\n\n01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:56.040\nDifferent animals coyotes are different wolves. I could not take on wolves. Oh, it's coyotes. Let me be real clear\n\n01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.360\nThat was certainly one of the highlights\n\n01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.000\nI wish we could do a clip show that would be like Johnny Carson would do because that would be one of the clips would be Spencer\n\n01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.920\ndemonstrating how he would it is 9-11 and it's a 200th episode\n\n01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.280\nIt's time to talk about politics\n\n01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:20.440\nThat that disaster reminds me of another that the the the the but yeah, Spencer demonstrating\n\n01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:24.360\nYou know how he would fight off a a a gang of coyotes\n\n01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.080\nHe's using only a backpack and his feet\n\n01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.440\nThat he added he had figured it out\n\n01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:35.800\nWhat would the concept of our clip show be what would we well that there would be that clip and then there would be like\n\n01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.600\nOh, we're all stuck in the nerd milk Nerdmelt attic\n\n01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:44.960\nAnd we have to keep warm by remembering things about arm and down. Oh, right. You actually had a really really good concept for clip shows\n\n01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.040\nThat's why I'm asking. Yeah, well, I think that's a pretty good one\n\n01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:54.320\nYou could do we're cleaning up the head that mr. Meltdown. It's like you're about to clean up the attic\n\n01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.040\nDid I name myself mr. Meltdown itself fulfilling prophecy? Oh god\n\n01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.760\nI feel like I should be just a whole montage of Anatoly's shirts. Yes\n\n01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:12.320\nYeah, we're watching Anatoly's posture change from like Yakov Smirnoff to fucking like like\n\n01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:18.000\nI'd Dracula like where he was just like his feet were up at the back of the stage\n\n01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.200\nResputing\n\n01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:27.520\nEnti is here. Yeah, but it is kind of like my girlfriend. She's not well. Yeah, she's kind of like my girlfriend\n\n01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.680\nBut I won different and he's also kind of similar to my girlfriend and that you're not much of a showman\n\n01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:40.400\nI'm just saying like I like to I'm big fan of the show and I I like connecting with people that I've heard their names\n\n01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:45.000\nAnd you're one of them and what do you come up and just sit just for a second\n\n01:03:53.840 --> 01:04:01.120\nSo, you know me I didn't mean to do it. I do know you. Oh, I do know you so you started coming coming pretty early in the run\n\n01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:07.160\nOh, oh, yeah, like four years ago. Do you always we've been doing it for four years four years\n\n01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:12.400\nThat was one of the guys when I met kind of cold. That's why I met Adam and Spencer. We only do 50 episodes a year\n\n01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:20.640\nYeah, yeah, we do we do less than 50 a year. That's pretty good. That's good gotta be away. We can push that envelope. I know\n\n01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.320\nWhat does Marin do? I was just thinking we we've lost there's Dan Dan 53\n\n01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:30.680\nFuckin isn't this like episode 204 or something technically?\n\n01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.680\nOh\n\n01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.880\nJesus was\n\n01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.520\nNo\n\n01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.920\nSpencer\n\n01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:51.400\nCelebration of the equinox you guys killed the shadow people. It was great\n\n01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.320\nYeah, well, do you mean that because we did a several episodes before we actually started now\n\n01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:02.120\nThere's just unreleased episodes. Oh, there are unreleased episodes is one where I got super duper drunk and probably coked up and like announced\n\n01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:08.360\nMy return to community you're admitting you do coke now like way before I was supposed to I think we I think I don't think we played\n\n01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.720\nWe should have had a lot more on aired episodes, by the way\n\n01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.560\nYeah, there was one where I went into a lot of detail explaining the whole Chevy\n\n01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.920\nThere's there's episodes that you haven't aired because you were they were that\n\n01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:23.560\nOh, I really want to get a hold of those\n\n01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.800\nWell, I listened to because we were gonna release them at one point the last episodes\n\n01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:33.800\nBut I had been through so I'd like I had to go through a lot of my personas like like I had to come around to the realization\n\n01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.760\nAnd the internet had to become the internet became everyone's life\n\n01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:41.680\nThere was a point when the internet was just a place where people kind of huddled even after it was only nerds\n\n01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:45.040\nIt was still then it was just like social misfits and it was always there\n\n01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:51.440\nI'm just sounding defensive, but there was a there was a point in the in the internet's existence where it was still kind of\n\n01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:55.560\nIt felt okay to just sort of expose yourself or whether I wasn't like famous\n\n01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:01.320\nIt's not really like like like so I would like write blogs about like like like my friends and what they were doing\n\n01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:07.120\nI would never do that now because it's like it feels like ever since you weren't so aware that other people were\n\n01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.120\nhuman\n\n01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:12.560\nLooking at you. Yeah, not reading it. I don't know people were like\n\n01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:16.440\nI was like aware of days of my my space like it was like oh and your wildest dreams\n\n01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:21.040\nSomeone would find this written on this coconut that you threw into the ocean and oh sure enough\n\n01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:26.680\nThere's there's my friend Kelly Oxford. She's she's she's she's responding in the comments and we're friends because she's one of the\n\n01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:30.920\nFew people reading or the all my friends are reading. It's like there's 600 people reading your my space blog\n\n01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:36.160\nSo you're kind of like gossip girl in terms of like what you're saying. I'm assuming she gossips. I don't know\n\n01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:42.440\nThe the but then that and then you flash forward to like the Chevy Chase event, which was like I\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.400\nI still I wasn't trying to put that on the internet. I was play that was before we started podcasting\n\n01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:53.280\nI was playing it into the microphone here. I thought you know dumbly like like just let's just enjoy this for a second\n\n01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.600\nAnd then one person was like yeah, you just enjoy it for a second\n\n01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:02.680\nBut and then and then I was that person here tonight. What if that person's it? Why don't you stand up?\n\n01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:09.640\nIt's Nick. Let's bring up Chevy Chase. But then I was like, oh, I'm affecting other people's lives\n\n01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:13.440\nI have to stick to talking about myself. I can't remember why we were talking about this\n\n01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:19.160\nBut what was the point? Oh, no idea. I yeah lost episodes because so there's a lot\n\n01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.200\nThere's last episodes where it's like I'm talking about community and I'm talking about Chevy Chase\n\n01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:26.280\nIt was like with the community thing. It was like oh the fans are like they're getting bumped out every time\n\n01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:30.040\nI open my mouth. I just want to like like don't want them to be touched by my\n\n01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.240\nthing, you know, and then\n\n01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.760\nThat sounds like a penis. I mean they're already trapped in a van with me the least I could do is not following\n\n01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:43.280\nAnd then the Chevy thing obviously it was like oh Jesus. Yeah, I've done enough there\n\n01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.560\nSo but but but in that episode I do explain explain like what happened\n\n01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:53.200\nI think it's the actual episode where I played it. That was it was recorded. It's the last episode\n\n01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:57.480\nBecause we never had a podcast again. Anyways, I just read it on the internet episode\n\n01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:03.200\nWe go by itunes counting the episodes that we upload. It's our 200th episode. Yes, Spencer\n\n01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:15.320\nSo Spencer, what do you think happens when you die you what happens when Spencer dies?\n\n01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:18.000\nWhat?\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.560\nWhat happens when you die you stop living do you have any insurance is what he's asking? Oh\n\n01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:27.520\nIs there it's just a bloody long-term pet probably oblivion, right? I don't know\n\n01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:32.560\nHey, why why think about that? They got so much other shit to worry about\n\n01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:41.560\nWhat you're worrying about I'm I'm writing or I know you know working on Harmon quest coming to see so I\n\n01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.520\nLove that attitude. I don't care about death. I have a TV show. Yeah\n\n01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:53.960\nI'll worry about death when I stop having a TV show. It makes sense. That's literally what happened\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.560\nThat's why he went on tour. I'm sure I'm sure King Ted didn't call for the pyramids to be made like during some big battle\n\n01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:07.120\nLike like like you should kill those people and enslave those Jews and at the exact same time build giant pyramids that everyone can see\n\n01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.520\nThe whole time I'm sure he was like there's no more Jews to enslave. What should I do with them?\n\n01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:14.080\nWhat if you had one of my tomb was a fucking city?\n\n01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:21.880\nWhat if you had to navigate by all right Dan hot hot cue from Andrew Sprogue a\n\n01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:28.160\nSprogue at a Sprogue hot cues kill Mary fuck Rob Adam enti kill me\n\n01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.120\nWell, I'm gonna which rom I assume it's Rob\n\n01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:36.360\nDon't know.

I didn't do any show promoter and I'm three feet tall\n\n01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:29.440\nThat was a goodie\n\n01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:35.200\nAnd I also vow that that this financial quarter before we do our next and within the next 200 episodes\n\n01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:38.640\nI will also write lyrics to the popcorn song hot butter popcorn\n\n01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:40.640\nUh\n\n01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:46.400\nI know it's just something like all all the all these kernels gotta pop\n\n01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:51.920\nAll this popcorn never stops when you've got the popcorn.

I got plenty of time\n\n01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:20.560\nI think I'm almost certain I said this if I said it on the show it would have been a very long time ago\n\n01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:22.800\nBut you know, you're rapping when you're around around the house\n\n01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:25.040\nYeah, we're talking about this when you're cleaning the house\n\n01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:30.160\nYou're making a sandwich and you're rapping and you're doing it and it's also how much I have a game where how\n\n01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:32.480\nCan I embarrass myself so much that I stopped doing it?\n\n01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:35.360\nWhere I'm actually ashamed that I'm watching\n\n01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:39.040\nUh, and if anybody else was watching I would have stopped a long time ago\n\n01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:41.920\nBut uh, there was one lyric when I was taking a shit\n\n01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:47.280\nAnd I said I ate so much poop. I ate so much food. I could poop on a dude\n\n01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:52.000\nThat's pretty proud of that one. It made me laugh for a while\n\n01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:55.920\nI remember when we were we were we were you were you were rapping on the car\n\n01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:01.520\nWe were doing the thing like I mean it was part of a larger thing and then you you were wrapped you were like\n\n01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:03.520\nWell\n\n01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:07.520\nWell, I like I like to eat poop.

I want to let the lightning bug fly away\n\n02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:41.760\nFuck lightning bugs in a jar and the lightning bug would fly away and you'd say mother fuckers should have put that thing in a jar\n\n02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:43.760\nI'm never gonna catch one again for the rest of my life\n\n02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:47.040\nThat's this rap right now\n\n02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:49.520\nAnd we're gonna give it up for Dan Armin\n\n02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:51.840\n200 episodes\n\n02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:58.480\nCapture that lightning bug then capture the lightning bug\n\n02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:05.520\nLet's go let's go.

S'mores, hot chocolate with marshmallow\n\n02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:14.240\nI fucked your mama and she said hello. I said you did that in the wrong order\n\n02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:17.360\nYou're supposed to greet me before I border with you\n\n02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:23.920\nShe said border with me.

I took it up a tree and cut down a log\n\n02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:34.400\nThe dog died because the tree fell down\n\n02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:36.960\nAnd I buried it and then I frowned\n\n02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:40.960\nI read the bible. I saw the light. I took your mama outside\n\n02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:47.040\nBut tonight I bought her dinner. I bought her soup. I told your mama I have to poop\n\n02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:54.000\nI went to the bathroom. I defecated. I came outside and I said I hated pooping. She said why?\n\n02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.200\nI said it hurt. She said I should take you to a doctor. I said word\n\n02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:02.720\nShe took me all the way downtown. The doctor said for you now my heart said you're gonna die\n\n02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:07.760\nI said why? He said MRI. We're gonna find out why. We're gonna look at your eye\n\n02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:11.360\nWe'll look at my retina. You said you got cancer. I said what did I do?\n\n02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:14.880\nHe said you're a dancer.

He said I'm a doctor\n\n02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:27.280\nMy words don't last. I said they're almost changing the lexicon of the of the of the diagnostic manual\n\n02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:32.480\nMan, I said let's go down. I'm out of breath. He said that's why you're gonna die to death\n\n02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:37.360\nAnd I said I'm gonna die to death. He said yeah, it's a bread. I said I ate some bread and I died. Now I'm dead\n\n02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:43.280\nI went to heaven. There was a simulation. I saw God and I said hey, what was I was what were you doing?\n\n02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:47.360\nAnd he said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, don't come up at me like that. I said I'm sorry. I didn't try\n\n02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:52.880\nHe said I'm God. G-O-D. I've created the earth. You're welcome from me\n\n02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:57.680\nI made the pearly gaze to keep you out. So you gotta go back down. You got no clap\n\n02:04:57.680 --> 02:05:03.120\nSt. Peter is here to keep your ass on the other side. I said fuck him. I tell his ass gets real wide\n\n02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:07.920\nAnd then I did it and I went inside and I was inside of St. Peter. It was like a robot suit\n\n02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:12.080\nSo then I got inside heaven, but I didn't get invited. I was walking around\n\n02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:17.840\nAnd like I was very excited because I was like Iron Man, but I had St. Peter for a body\n\n02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:23.040\nAnd I took off my halo and I threw it and it was a weapon and you can do it\n\n02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:28.400\nIt'll it'll come back to you like thorns shield and I bet you didn't know a halo could be wielded\n\n02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:33.040\nBut I did it and I went to hell and I killed the devil and I said well\n\n02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:35.680\nNow there's no dichotomy between good and bad\n\n02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:42.080\nSo now we can all go back to earth and stop being sad. We can plant trees and recycle our food\n\n02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:48.160\nNot sure I don't really have a plan of action after ending dichotomy\n\n02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:55.920\n200 episodes. One, two, three. 200 episodes. You've all done with me. 200 episodes. Four, five, six.\n\n02:05:56.400 --> 02:06:01.360\n200 episodes. Full of balls and dicks. We've been through it. We've got on to the other side.\n\n02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:06.240\nWe've learned things. We've learned of races. Why? We've learned of misogynist. I go over that.\n\n02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:09.120\nI've made friends with lesbians and I can't even top that.\n\n02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.080\nNow I'm friends with everybody. I used to be a fat white person. Now I'm somebody.\n\n02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:18.880\nI'm a kid but I'm woke. I'm going to cry and then choke.\n\n02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:32.720\nEverybody. I'm going to cry and then I'm going to choke. 200 episodes. 200 episodes.\n\n02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:37.840\nThank you for coming to Heartland Town, everybody.
