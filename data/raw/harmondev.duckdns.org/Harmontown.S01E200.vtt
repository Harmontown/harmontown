WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
Hollywood, California, The Nerdmelt Theater, and Meltdown Comics, the 200th Harmontown

00:18.000 --> 00:43.000
is now in session. Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden, everybody.

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
Can we bring out Rob or do we bring out Dan first?

00:50.000 --> 01:10.000
Let's bring out Dan Harmon, the mayor, and let him make that decision.

01:10.000 --> 01:26.000
Scoping, I got a scope in my pocket. Scoping, periscoping, millennial media, there's no bounds.

01:26.000 --> 01:46.000
Souls are lost, but highways are bound to enrol. Problematization, publication, new immigration, and I'm scoping. I'm not scoping, I'm scoping, I'm scoping, I'm loping with you.

01:46.000 --> 02:12.000
Periscope, what do you do? Periscope, Periscope, looking up to the world from the submarine of privacy, waging war on the Nazis,

02:12.000 --> 02:36.000
the U-boats, with their stockades, I mean blockades, I mean shockade, drink the shockade. Periscope, Periscope, looking up to the Periscope, looking up.

02:36.000 --> 02:57.000
Periscope, Periscope.

02:57.000 --> 03:10.000
It's incredible. Dan, it took us 200 episodes to find out that you were a great rock and roller. We've been doing bad rap for a long time now.

03:10.000 --> 03:22.000
It should have been Jordy White from Manson and from Perfect Circle. What else do you got? What? Let's do our 200th episode theme.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
Alright, so you got something a little slower, a little more ballady.

03:27.000 --> 03:34.000
I usually ask our friends to make music for us for it to be a little bit more driven. Let me see here.

03:34.000 --> 03:52.000
This is by Johnny Polanski, good friend. Is that going to work for you?

03:52.000 --> 04:04.000
Is that going to work? Yeah, you can just keep holding it like that.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
The thing is, our friend Titanic and our friend Jordy, they have all kinds of slow music I didn't put on there because I never use it.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
Episode 201, no I'll be in London, but episode 203.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.000
Remember how great episode 199 was? We're covered.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Was I here? Yeah, I was here.

04:26.000 --> 04:34.000
Isn't it weird because it feels like you're showing people things, but you're filming them. It makes you feel like you're a game show hostess.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
You just turned a woman in the front row into your creepy webcam lady.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah, you have a look of utter distaste in your face right now.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
Alright, so we'll sing the 200th episode song later.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
Alright, well let's talk about...

04:56.000 --> 05:04.000
Alright, we're going to stop Periscope down because you can watch us at Harmontown.com live for free.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
It says please don't stop this.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Don't listen to them.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
But now that they're going to be typing and they know that you're not going to be listening.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
But they're all talking to each other, they're all seeing it, right? Are they all seeing each other's scopes?

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
These people are just hardcore periscope fans.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
I've never seen this before in my life, I'm kind of excited.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
Hey, NT, how's it going? We're NT right in the front row, Hammer.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Yeah, that's some 200 episode shit right there.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Is that going to be upside down now?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
It'll be fine.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
There, now stop complaining.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
Don't these periscope people know that tonight is the only time it's free to watch the live stream?

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
They love periscope! You don't try to dictate how people see stuff.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
That's why people have failed to monetize the internet. You don't understand.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
But Shroff, if you love bacon, go to the pig.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
You don't just...

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
What if Schrab never actually came out on stage?

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
What if he just stood there the whole time?

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
Those of you not watching Shroff is lurking, he's buttoning his shirt, he puts some glasses on.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
I think he means business.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
He looks a little angry.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
He looks like he might be... is there something in his mouth?

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
He's rolling his sleeves up.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
Again, we're making podcast history with all this visual gags.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
Alright. He only rolled once, leave him!

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Well, come up and sit down then, I guess.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
I'll stand!

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
The people behind you paid ten dollars.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
To look at my ass.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
I'm going to sit next to a fence.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
Let's get another chair.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
I feel a little embarrassed because it feels like Rob expected there to be more of a hoopla, just from seeing him.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
So that's why he had to just start buttoning and rolling things.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Because he was like, shit, what do I do?

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
I thought standing, oh, for sure, just for appearing.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
He came over and he was behind the pillar, most of the crowd.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
You don't know what I was thinking.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
He doesn't even have a chair.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
No, no, Jeff, I got this.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
You didn't know what I was thinking.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
Everything went exactly the way I wanted it to.

07:55.000 --> 08:02.000
Exactly the way I wanted it to.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
But it doesn't matter because we're all in a simulation.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
As confirmed by Elon Musk, a hero to probably all of my listeners.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Didn't he just say that there's a chance that we're in a simulation?

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
No, he said there's a very, very slim chance we're not.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
And that we probably are in a thousandth simulation deep inside a simulation.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
We're probably one of the things a chess computer thinks it might do before it decides to make its real move.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
We're probably not even the actual fake artificial thing that's going to happen.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
We're probably a hypothetical algorithmic exploration of a possibility.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
You think the chess algorithm, deep blue or whatever that was,

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
when he was playing whoever it was, Spassky, who did he play?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Spassky.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
It was Kasparov.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
It was Kasparov.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Do you think that when the computer is like,

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
okay, I'm going to go through the motions of thinking about my next move,

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
but should I just tell them?

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
Yeah, I'm the more advanced.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
What does that change anything?

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
How does that change anything? I still got to go to work in the morning.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
How does that change anything?

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
But it's a simulated job now.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Like, it's nice. I think it's an improvement.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
I would rather think of myself as entering oblivion,

09:26.000 --> 09:35.000
having taken part in some kind of artificial man-made or lady-made lady.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
I mean, if they're advanced enough to simulate a universe,

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
there could be women working in computer science.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
I'm just saying man-woman versus man-in-lady.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I'm classy.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
I may be a feminist, but I still have my charms.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Who wants to go for a free drink at a woman's night?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm like, I'm going to fuck you on the floor

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
and leave with your boyfriend's Porsche feminist.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
I'm a casino royale feminist.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
I'm a feminist in that I will let you...

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
run your tears down my washboard as I emerge from the saltwater ocean

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
with my diamond-hard nipples poking your eyes out.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Our bicentennial episode, your rock and roll,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
you're kind of a tough kick-ass...

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
Kind of a tough-on-the-ladies feminist?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
It's a new thing.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
You know who else was?

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
Bond fucking Jovey.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
He told them, I'm a cowboy.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
He didn't mean literally,

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
he meant I'm not going to call you back.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
And they were like, thank you.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Because I'm not always just into relationships.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Sometimes I just want to fuck Bond Jovey.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Why do you think he was wanted, dead or alive?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
What did he do?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Did he rob a bank?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Because he rides on a steel horse.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Oh, is that illegal now? The death penalty?

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
For riding on a steel horse?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Shit.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I got him back to back.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
Now those sentences, dead or alive.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
It's not a highway, it's not road legal,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
but his steel horse.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
He didn't have a helmet on.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
I think what he meant was that he's wanted,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
he feels like a piece of meat.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
It's like when John Lennon said,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
the way things are going, they're going to crucify me.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
It's like when you're at the peak of your rock and roll-ness.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Back me up, Spencer.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Aw, yeah.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Aw, man.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Aw, shit.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I feel bad now.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
I feel bad.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
I feel bad.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
We feel bad.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
We feel bad now.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
We feel so bad.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
I don't know if you guys know the difference

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
between backup and interruption.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
No, I do.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
We don't.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I totally don't.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Right, yeah, no, we get it.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I think he's just saying like,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I don't think people even care that I'm a human being.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
That's what he means, wanted, dead or alive.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
I think you'd want me even if this next song was bad,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
you know, like that is the Cobain thing.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
It's like, I don't even know anymore.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
I went and saw Bon Jovi a couple of times for some reason,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
and when he came out on stage,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
he came out on stage and I was sitting next to a woman

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
and her daughter, and the woman was probably like,

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
I would say maybe late 40s.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
And the daughter was, you know, 18 or 19.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Or whatever.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Like, the woman was, somebody whistled,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
that's good.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
So anyway, I'm fucking him.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
And I mean, Dan, I mean,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Bon Jovi style.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
On a steel horse.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Maybe the woman was a little bit older than that

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
and the daughter was also a little bit older

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
because neither of them was primetime

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Bon Jovi fan age.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
But the daughter was there to see the band

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
because she heard about him,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
because the 80s was coming back, you know,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
like for you people.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And I was talking to the mom.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
She's like, I didn't even know this band.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
She plays him, she loves him.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
When Bon Jovi came on stage,

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
she was like a young girl at an Elvis concert.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
It was just, she screamed as much as anybody there.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
That was amazing to watch.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
Like, whatever you like or don't like about Bon Jovi's music,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
he's got great blonde hair and he's got just,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
he's just buns.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
It's all about buns.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
If you haven't rock and roll Dan, great hair, buns.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
His hair is in buns.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
If you put his hair in more buns,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
that would be amazing.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
If you put this hair in one bun.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Is he back?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Well, I'm a periscoper.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
I'm going to shut you down because

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
you can watch it at harmontown.com live

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
and you've probably figured out

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
how boring the periscope could be by now.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
There's like five cameras on the other thing.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Stop being so sluggishly periscope-

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Sorry, audience.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Scopophiles.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
They're admitting they're in a submarine.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
They're in a tube in the bottom of the sea.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
How do you, oh, stop.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I thought you hated social media.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
She knows how to work it?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
You just don't like it.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
She just resents that it knows how to work her.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
You know?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
It's from a societal perspective.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
It sounded sexual.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
This is why they went like, whoa.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
He's giving her the green light.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
But you know what I meant.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I meant in a David Bowie way.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Which is never sexual.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
We're in a simulation.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I think that's about it.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
That's such bullshit, man.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Don't scientists make fun of

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
religious people for having ridiculous beliefs?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
It's so stupid.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
There's magic people all around.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
They get back to life.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
What about the gnomes?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
We're in a simulation,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
but there's no fucking gnomes.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
If we were simulated right now,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
we would have some talking gnomes

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
in the backyard.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
If we're in a simulation,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
we should be mad that we're in a gnomeless,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
dragonless simulation.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
We got stuck in a shit simulation.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I think you guys should be stoked

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
that we're in a gnomeless, dragonless simulation,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
because you know what that probably means.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
That it's closer to reality,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
which means that we're the simulation

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
that may prove that it's possible

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
to simulate a reality

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
from within a simulation.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
We could really butter our bread with this one.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
We could be headed for the major simulation leagues.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
They could bump us up

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
to a thumb drive

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
that they sell in their best buys

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
in their weird alien world

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
where women are equals.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
All right. Our next guest...

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Yeah, I'll take a chair.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
All right. Our next guest

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
was peeing while we were

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
talking for the last five minutes,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
but right before I was going to bring him up,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
so let's bring him out. Now, Rob Corddry's back!

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Yeah!

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I'm going to sit

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
in a chair like a normal guest.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Yeah.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Yeah.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Rob, you're taking a big liberty.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
You're...

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
You're exercising a liberty

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
over there.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I think Rob is such a director

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
and so completely

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
conniving and Machiavellian.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I think he found a camera here in our mix

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
that he really liked. I think he knows

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
he's being hit by Spencer's cam.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
And he's in a sexy two-shot at all times right now.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I wore this red plaid.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
That's why you entered from stage left

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
or stage right. That's the only shirt

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I ever see you wear.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I know. It's my default shirt.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Either that or my default

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
jacket that goes over my default shirt.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Do tonight feel like a default

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
shirt kind of event, Rob?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Our 200th episode?

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Rob, grab a microphone.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Yes.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Oh, grab a microphone?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Jesus Christ. You want me to be louder?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
This is... Dan, this...

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
fucking ship is sinking.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I know. It's fucking...

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Norman Lear was here.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
It's not my 200th!

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
It's not my 200th show!

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
It's not my 200th show!

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
If this was my 200th show...

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
This isn't my 200th show!

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
It's your 200th show.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I'll wear a fucking tuxedo on my

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
200th show!

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Hey, I wear a...

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
But you won't have one!

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Right! Because you...

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I hosted. You feed on me.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
You feed on me. Yes!

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
You'll never get rid of me!

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I'm not going anywhere.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I'm going to be right here

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
right in the corner of your eye

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
for the rest of your life!

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Mocking you!

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Rob, in 180 episodes,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I want to see your tuxedo.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Oh, yeah. I got one.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I got a couple.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I got one for each arm.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Come on.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Dan?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Dan, I want to apologize to you

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
because in the weeks that I've been away,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
your shows have been excellent.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Oh, thank you.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Norman fucking Lear was on this show.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
And...

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
God, I wanted to be here

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
just to wrangle...

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I felt like, oh,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
my job, if I was there,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
would be to wrangle Schrab.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Right. It would be to...

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Yeah, I would have to wrangle it.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
You won a little out of wine for that one.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
No, I was so nice. I feel like...

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I was so nice in that one.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
What are you talking about?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
There was a couple times

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
when I was yelling at my radio.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I was like...

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Schrab, Schrab, Schrab, Schrab, Schrab.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
And I was making a hand gesture.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Oh, yeah.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
You listened to Good Rob?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Thank you.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Never!

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Hey, Dan, ask Rob a question.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Like, just talk to Rob for a second.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Yeah, ask me how my week was.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
See how that's...

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Yeah, just ask him how my week was.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I'm doing a little

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
controlling experiment over here.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
It's like asking Donald Trump

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
if I'm a loser.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Like, I don't know.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I don't know.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
If he had anything to say about himself,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
or whatever.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Schrab, how was your day?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
It was pretty good. I was working at the office.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
And...

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
you know,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I never did it with a Red Bull.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
My tongue is feeling

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
very...

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
very sensitive right now.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
And then...

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Yeah, that was pretty much it for today.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
All right.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I slept in these clothes.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
200 episodes!

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Yeah!

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I think...

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Jeff's trying to prove that

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
the camera...

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Spencer was the only one on that shot

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
the entire time.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Yeah.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I'm not here.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I feel like I'm being back-controlled right now.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I think you're trying to sneak-attack

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
undermine my controlling authorities.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Because I come out...

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
You did not!

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I come out stage left

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
every show.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Every episode, you had to come out stage right

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
and sit down at the opposite side of the stage

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
as me.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
And I feel like I know exactly what you're doing.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Okay.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I think this is real.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
All right. Well, okay.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
If it's a simulation...

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
So...

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
So I want to know...

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
I know that...

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I ask the question, you know,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
are people watching me jerk off?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Is anyone watching me jerk off?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
And...

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Yes.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
And...

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Those people you pay every morning when they come over to your house.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And I asked Cody that.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And she said, why would they watch you

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
when I'm in there?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
They're watching me.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
But I don't think they would be watching me

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
for pleasure or even for just like, oh, look,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
he's drinking off. But I feel like

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
they might be watching me for like,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
just like, look how dishonest he is.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Like, look how...

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I look how much he really thinks no one's watching.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
You think maybe like in the simulation

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
that whoever's watching us,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
you might be like a...

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
One that they're like, this is a special...

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Like a puny pie.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Where our camera is usually pointed at this dude

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
because he exhibits

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
a lot of very fascinating behavior.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah, like I'm Michael Scott of the simulated

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Dunder Mifflin.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
All right.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I'll buy that.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
I'm worth it. I just think they'd be making fun of me.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
But what do you guys...

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
I believe all this, by the way.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
So, by the way, since it's our 200th episode...

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I heard you wrong.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Thanks, man.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Go ahead and...

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I guess maybe if you...

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Well, I don't know.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Hashtag any questions

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
or questions

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
that you have for Harmontown at its 200th episode.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Tweet...

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Tweet

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
At Jeff Bryan Davis.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Is that your Twitter?

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Jeff Bryan Davis, Bryan with a Y.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Jeff Bryan Davis, Bryan with a Y.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
And maybe hashtag it...

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Snuggle, but...

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I don't know.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
You don't have to hashtag anything.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Maybe some short hashtag.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Hashtag hot cues.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Hot cues?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Hot questions.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Hot cues.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Hot cues.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Jeff, can aggregate your questions

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
if there's any good ones

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
and things start to slow down

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
at any point on this episode.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Hey, I'd like to...

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
I'd like to open that up

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
for anybody who wants to hashtag me, too.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Just to help out with the show.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
You can hashtag me if you want.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Hashtag me.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
It's like the show has just become

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
about how I hate him.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Yeah.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
He's throwing a line in the sand

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
with his whole...

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
So far, all I'm getting

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
is a lot of new followers.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
It's better than my Teen Wolf people.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Apparently, Teen Wolf

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
going into season five, you guys.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
We did it.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Do you know about Teen Wolf

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
and my thing with Teen Wolf?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
The guy that created

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
not the movie, the TV show

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
and MTV that I've never seen.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
The guy that created it is named Jeff Davis.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
So a good percentage of my followers

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
love and hate me

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
because of this TV show.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
So I'm frequently fielding

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
sex commands and death threats.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Horrible.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Okay, well, you know what?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Who would win in a fight, Dan,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
between Rob Schrab

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
and Rod Cordry?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Hashtag hot cues.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
It's not a good question.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
It's not going to help the show at all.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Maybe Spencer should take that question.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
That's more of a Spencer question.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I don't know.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Uh, Cordry definitely looks

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
bulkier right now.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Look at you, man. You got muscles.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Look at this guy.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
He doesn't look like he's eating

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
right in weeks, you know?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
I hear he's a vegetarian now.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Just come on.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
I don't know. I'm from Boston.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I do have bad ads.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I've been punching the face a lot.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
And smaller

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Bostonians.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Is all he eats.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Listen to it later.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
We'll try to dig out my audio.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I saw him

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
in the

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
storefront tonight.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
It's our 200th episode.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
He's been a big part of our mythology.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
He's come. He's gone. He's been around.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
I don't know if it's going to

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
pick things up. Give us a new scapegoat.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Just drive things all the way into the ditch

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
and bury us with our own shovel.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
But if Adam Goldberg wanted to come up

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
and pay a visit.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah!

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Oh, no!

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
He's exactly as I pictured it.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Sorry, Twitter hashtaggers.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
This might have to go on hold for a while.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Oh.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Time for the hot cues to meet the hot A.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Adam. Adam Goldberg.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
That one's been cooking for a while.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
That was perfect.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
That was the perfect delivery.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
The timid.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
The barrel breach.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Got some gunpowder in your eyes.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
I don't even know.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I looked aside as you shot it.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
I know the show has gotten changed

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
because people are like, I miss you.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
So you guys have to have done some.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Well, I'm back, y'all.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
We've had some bad episodes.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Yeah!

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
How you been, Adam?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Good, good, good and pretty good.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Good, good and pretty good.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
It kind of trailed off towards the end there.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Not that good.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Not five good.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
How's your spine?

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
That sounds rude.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
It's fine. I finally stopped being on

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Terrible Reality Show.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Wait, no, that's not true.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I'm actually producing a movie in Ireland,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
which is...

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Yes.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
The subject of the film is currently

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
not able to talk about script development

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
because her car was destroyed by an ex-boyfriend

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
who blew it up due to IRA nonsense.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
So that's my life.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
That's my life.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
So in your short time in Ireland,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
you've actually...

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Oh, I'm not going over there yet until that gets settled.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
I thought you reignited it by going over there.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I thought you somehow...

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I was like, really? I thought that was over.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
That's why they kicked us out in 950

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
because it's like, if the Goldberg's coming from this,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
it's like, we'd rather have the snakes.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Adam, what do you think happens after we die?

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Oh, man.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I guess we reboot.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I don't worry about what happens after we die

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
because I know there was a lovely time

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
in our history before I was alive,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
and I figured we're just going to the other side of it.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
I don't think we're in a matrix

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
inside of a matrix inside of a matrix

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
because that just took a really good movie

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
and ended up with Morpheus

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
stabbing people with a katana

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
on top of an oil tanker.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Well, that's just...

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
But we might be able to make good matrix movies

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
in 10 years.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
It's time for a reboot.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
There's so many unanswered questions in the first place.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
If we're in a simulation,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
do you think people starting to say

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
I think we're in a simulation

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
is, A,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
the goal of the simulation,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
B, a corruption

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
of the simulation that will have to be

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
terminated with immediate...

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
whatever the opposite of the big bang is,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
a big suck?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Do you think that it has anything

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
to do with the concept of a simulation?

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Or is it just a byproduct?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
If the simulation didn't want people

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
to know it was a simulation,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Rene Descartes would have said,

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
I think, therefore I exist,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
and then died of a nosebleed in seconds later.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Why?

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Because he thought, oh, the only thing I can know

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
about myself is that I exist,

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
because someone has to be able to say I exist.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
And then he got into the idea

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
of this weird malevolent ghost

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
and therefore God exists,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
and then they kicked the Jews out of France.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
That was him?

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
No, not...

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
It wasn't not him.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I think, therefore, I'm Christian.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Careful.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Careful.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
What, are they going to kick us out of NerdPel too?

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Is there a Jean-Paul Sartre in the house?

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Adam Goldberg.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I was asked somebody here on hot cues.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Dan, they still have a great question.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Let me answer that.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Normal.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
No, beige?

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
I would have looked this.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
What about that right there?

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Those are lines from the weight of my chips.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
It's not a line.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
It's a glistening line of sweating.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
It does have the sweat in it.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
It's a boot sweat.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Yeah, I do.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Let me look.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Okay, Spencer, on our side,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
we're getting a lot of beige

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
with like a dark red beige element to it.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Spencer, what color are they from your...

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
I'd say they're like a dark beige

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
with like a dark red beige element.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
The secret's just like...

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
The normal looking nipples.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Yeah, I'm just really sorry

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
about the whole sweat thing.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I feel terrible about that.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
No, it's...

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I saw a line of sweat and I laughed and I...

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
But I'm using it as an opportunity

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
to send a message to the young people

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
that they don't have to be body shamed.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
You know what? It doesn't matter

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
wherever you sweat, you sweat, and I'm sorry.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
You say body sweater, body slam.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Body...

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
I do want to do an Instagram photo of me

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
with my sweaty titties.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
I was thinking about you being on Mooch of the Boom yesterday.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Dressed as Jareth, and I thought I heard the word body slam.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Dan, what's with your underwear?

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
What's with your underwear?

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Show us your underwear, bro!

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Hashtag hot kids!

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Turn around! Turn around with your...

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Look at this!

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Did you...

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Did you...

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Those are great underwears.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Do you escape from...

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Why did you leave for a hundred episodes?

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I don't think...

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
I don't think this is the sponsorship

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
that they had hoped for, but those are my me undies.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
No, they're definitely me undies.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I hear they're the most comfortable undies in the world.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
They are very comfortable, but I don't think

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
I'm doing them any favors.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Do you want your distended lower gut

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
to be summonable like Beetlejuice?

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Say me undies three times and...

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Watch the sparks fly.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
No, they're very...

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
They're quite comfortable.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
It's almost like cheating.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Dino always said that civilization peaked at dessert

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
because we were like,

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
okay, so I'm eating and I'm not hungry

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
because it's helping kill me.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
We definitely like was all downhill from there.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
But I think...

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
I guess I would...

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
It still sounds like it'll hold true,

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
but a good other candidate for the peak would be

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
men's undies starting to get real...

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Real panty-like.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Real technical.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Real satin-y.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Because it's like now it's just like,

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
well, what about me?

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
How come I can't feel like...

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
A soft little kitten when I'm working.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
At work the other day, I had to wear a dress.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Congrats.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
That's my job.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Sometimes.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
But it was a real hugger.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
And there was

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
five different pairs of

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
underwear

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
hanging in my trailer to try on with the dress.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
You know, to not show

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
lines.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
To lift and separate your balls.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
My huge, huge...

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
And

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
I tried on all of them.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Undulating.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Because I don't know anything about men's

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
underwear and there's a whole world out there.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
There's a whole wonderful world out there.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
It's not just like pieces of fabric

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
shaped like...

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
I can tell you, all the five brands I tried

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
were fantastic.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
It was one of them.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Andrew Christian, something like that?

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Because my ex-girlfriend, we were on

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Palmer Springs and my ex-girlfriend Kate,

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
I didn't have a bathing suit and

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
we asked around like, what's a good place to get a...

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
A bathing suit? A gating suit.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Dr. Freud, a patient for you?

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
The place is called

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Gay Mart America's Favorite Gay Superstore.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
And they have

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
awesome bathing suits in there, but they also have

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
the most absolutely

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
compendious...

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
There's aisle after aisle, row after row

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
of complicated

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
men's underwear. And guess what?

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
They feel good. They feel great.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
They feel fantastic. What are you rockin' right now?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
I think...

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
I'm just wearing kind of

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
boring Calvin Klein boxer briefs right now.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Laundry day tomorrow? I'm traveling

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
tomorrow, so all the good ones are in the bag.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
I hear you.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
How about you, Adam Goldberg?

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I just...

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Boxer briefs seem too tight, but I've never been

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
like, oh, my underwear is uncomfortable.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Not since, like, I've moved up from

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
the tighty whiteies around age nine

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
to be like, well, this is really holding

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
me back. I feel if I bought...

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
I feel if I bought one pair of meundies

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
lower the enjoyment

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
I get of all my non-meundie underwear.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Yeah, that's the goal of nice underwear, people, is to try to ruin you

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
on your faves.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
It's the base heathenism level of underwear.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
But also, you gotta think about, because I'm gonna be

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
on a long flight to London tomorrow,

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
and you gotta think about, I can't wear the snug

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
sexy ones, because that's gonna be too snug and sexy

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
for a long flight, but you can't wear

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
the kind of bloomery

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
boxer's ones, because those are...

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Right up on England. Oh, they're terrible.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Terrible. Cotton...

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Bunchy... Like, Haynes? Forget it.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
You're fucked. You're fucked.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Fuck you, Haynes.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Hashtag, fuck you, Haynes.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Hit me with a Twitter question.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Better be a good one. Hot cues.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
All right, well, I haven't been

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
looking through this.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
I got a hot cue for you, Jeff.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Adam? Oh, sorry.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
I wasn't yelling at you. Adam?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
I have one if you want it.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Are you still on with the Adam question?

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
No, no, no. I'll go to Adam next.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
This is fucking... Now we're cooking.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
This is a great show.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
You can ask a question, Rob.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
You don't have to tweet at Jeff to ask a question.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Jeff, will you...

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I was gonna ask another question, but someone just said

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
right now, Scott Sweeney asks

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Jeff Bryan Davis,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Dan, will you make the ruffle low kissy face?

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Hashtag, ruffle low soldier,

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
hashtag hot cues. What's the ruffle low kissy face?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
The secret is he's all...

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
I think. I've never done it in a mirror, but...

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
That's exactly it.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
That's the spotlight seduction.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
He's fucking so interested in all the

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
pedophilia, but not interested in it.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
He's interested in exposing it.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
I have a question.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I have a question for Chris backstage.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
I'm assuming it was Chris's...

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
No, who makes the banners?

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Someone asked,

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
where did the hot cues banner go?

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Apparently there's a little banner beneath us.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
I didn't know we had that technology.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
It's really taken off, guys.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
It's a meme.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
With the show, it'll explode outward.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
We can show people's tweets and answer them.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I could say, look at this. I took a picture of my dog today.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
It'll be great.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Goldberg, did you...

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Did I hear a rumor that you had

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
some kind of quiz?

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
I had a quiz.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I think this is...

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
If we have any super fans in the audience.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
All right.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Yeah, Cordray's a super fan.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Cordray raises his hand for the people.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Did we ever tell...

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Now I can't remember if we told the story,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
because I've asked you if we told the story.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
We never have.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Your wife and kids and you,

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
but you were working most of the time

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
in Bollard country.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Your wife and kids and therefore sometimes you

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
were living next door to me without knowing you.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Next door to you.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
At one point, you were trying to get on

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Wi-Fi.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
At an Airbnb,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
there were French rappers.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
You referenced French rappers living next to you

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
at an Airbnb.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
It's in one episode.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I was at this Airbnb and it was right near my house

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
because we lived very close to each other.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
And I was trying to get the Wi-Fi

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
and I didn't get it from my wife.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
And I looked and it said,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Harmon Wi-Fi.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
And I was like...

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Yeah.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
I got to change my password from Dan.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
I was going to text you

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
and say, what's your password

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
for your Wi-Fi?

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
It's not a good story.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
That's a great story.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Oh wait, no, the best part of the story is

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
do you remember the episode?

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
This is a great 200th episode, by the way.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Do you remember the episode where

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
you got your neighbors up here

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
to talk about the trees?

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
That was a good episode.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Get rid of this shit, your pants.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
What kind of trees were they?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
What countries?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Kind of trees, man.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Shit.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Eucalyptus.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
What countries were they?

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Anyway, eucalyptus trees.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
There was this whole thing.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
It's my favorite episode.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Where you...

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
This woman...

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
You read your tweets with your neighbor

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
on this stage.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Oh, that was the best.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
With the eucalyptus trees.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
And when I saw Harmon Wi-Fi,

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
I like...

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
I looked out the front window

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
and there's one eucalyptus tree

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
splitting

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
the yard between my Airbnb

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
and Dan's, what I know now

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
is Dan's is the front yard.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
And I was like, that's the fucking tree

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
that Dan won't cut down.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
That I won't even have looked at.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
And the neighbors are asking questions.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
That you've forgotten about since that episode.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Well, they're very important trees

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
and it's rotting and you should take care of it.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
I also have an

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
embroidered cross-stitch

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
thing that's that a fan made

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
that's framed that I wanted to give to Beth

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
because it's an embroidered

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
plaque, you know, like bless this mess style

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
kind of thing. But it says

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
in a weird way, Beth, that tree

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
can totally suck my human dick.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
And it's like very, very nicely done

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
and I was going to give it to her

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
to hang on her wall.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
I don't know why those two...

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Why she wasn't like a regular on this show.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
You should have had her back every week.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Maybe because she's so nice.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I don't like...

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
That's healthy.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Maybe people aren't as interesting

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
after their first appearance even if they come back

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
literally dozens of times.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Hey, man.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I'm sure that's a phenomenon.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Fuck you, Goldberg.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
That's a milestone for guests.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I thought he was trying to

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
find a loophole for giving himself.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
I was trying to get a laugh.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Goldberg, did you have a...

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
I got some cues, but I don't want to

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
get too jazzed about winning, you know?

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
So if you get it right, that's cool

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
and if you don't...

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
It doesn't matter.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
We're not having fun.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
There's an exit there and an exit there.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
I think people thought this was a quiz.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
It hasn't started yet.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
We're just having fun.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
A lot of people on Twitter are calling this a hot quiz, too.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
They want it to be an actual quiz.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Also, there's been hot jizz, hot sniz,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
and a lot of stuff that's been quite mean

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
and quite friendly.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
And also, I want to punch up so many of their jokes.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Yeah, you're really a hot wizz.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
A lot of people are like,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
I would have read that one if you just switched those two words around.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
So close.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Rob, this is probably the best question.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Go ahead.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Jeff predicted that there would be

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
an episode 200 trivia question

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
for two points. What was the question?

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Jesus.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Or for one point, I can say,

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
oh, man, oh, man.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Well, I don't know the

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
questions.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Anyone up here know the question?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Okay, so on episode 100,

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
you said that's going to be on the episode 200 quiz.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
These are really surging.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
We have a hand waving out there.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Uh, yep.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
What? Dan likes pippin?

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Dippin.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Dippin is the answer to the question,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
which was Dan's favorite desert island

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
foot sex move.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Okay.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
My favorite shoe play.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
What's dippin?

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
If I had to choose between dippin and heel popping,

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
I would choose dippin.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Has the foot fetish

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
movement evolved? Are those still the core?

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Yeah, what's going on with that?

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
How's that evolved? What's going on?

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
What's doing with your foot thing?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
The Pantios challenge has gotten harder.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Hey, hey, yeah. Hey, what's up with

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
that foot thing?

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Hey, come on, man.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Tell us a little bit more about that foot thing.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Yeah.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
I catch us up.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
I'd love to share as much as I can,

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
but it kind of impedes the privacy of my

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
beautiful footed girlfriend.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Call her Miss X.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Somebody tweeted it. It's way back down the

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
list and I don't know the name of the person

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
that tweeted it. Asked, will Cody ever be

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
up on the stage and in the show?

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Well, she's not one for the spotlight.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
I mean, as easy

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
on the eyes as she is.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Congrats.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Lovely woman.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
She herself, the human soul that she is,

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
is not like a performer.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
She gave up her voice so she could walk on

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
land with humans.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
So the tosy witch hurt it every time.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
She put it in her words.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
She loves attention.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
She loves attention.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
She loves attention.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
She loves attention as much as anybody,

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
but she likes unconditional attention.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
As soon as it starts to get conditional,

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
she doesn't have the stomach for it.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I don't understand that.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Well, yeah.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Some people are going to hate my guts

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
and tell me to kill myself with fire.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
No, in for a penny.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Just need that attention.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
And then other people are like,

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
yeah, I'll take it if it costs me anything.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
And she's one of the latter.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
So, you know.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
No?

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
I'm not going to make that choice for her.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
I don't think she's going to go like,

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
no, she's not going to come up on stage.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
She's not that type.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Massacist.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Where are you from in Boston?

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
And if I said, Cody, do you want to come up on stage?

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
She'd be put under pressure.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
And then if she came up, we wouldn't even know

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
if she wanted to.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
No, if she wanted to come up, she'd be right there

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
in the window and she's not so cool.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Okay, great.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Cody, do you do your thing?

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Don't worry about it.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
We got it.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Go ahead.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Somebody asked, this is a good question.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
I like this one.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Jeremy Hibis asks,

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Sounds right.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Hot cues.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Has Dan put anything in his butt

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
since the first episode of Harmon Chow?

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
It's a good question.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Not really since the Sharpie

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
that I put in my butt.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
That wasn't even during Harmon Chow, right?

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
That was a story that happened before Harmon Chow.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
We all put something in our butt

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
a long time ago that we were just

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
giving that a whirl.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
We didn't take it.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Or maybe we do.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
You put something up your butt and you were like,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
this is great.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
You put more stuff up your butt and you are good people too.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
You know that

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Great Proops is podcast's smartest man in the world?

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
One of his sponsors is Me Undies.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
We're not getting a nickel for this.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Great Proops is getting all that.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
He's getting sweet 35 cents per click.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
And those Me Undies, man, when you put them on,

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
it feels like a second skin.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Yeah.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
It feels like a delicious manta ray

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
wrapped around your balls.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Save it for the actual sponsorship, man.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Oh, sorry.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
I got a sizzling cue for you, Jeff.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Give me a hot cue, Adam Goldberg.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
How did you get associated

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
with Lucha Vavum?

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Did they contact you?

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Do you have any great stories about Lucha Doors?

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
I had a lot of great...

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Lucha Vavum is one of the coolest things

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
that I've ever involved.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
And I just had mutual friends

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
and they... Blanca Patch is a buddy of ours.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Yeah.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
It's a hilarious comedian, Blanca Patch.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
And he and people like Dana Gold and some other friends of ours

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
would rotate through with him.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
And I just managed somehow to kind of be

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
like the secondary host a lot in that show.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
But being...

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
When my friends come to the show,

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
what the show is, if you don't know it,

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
it's straight up part of Full House.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Fuller House.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Like Lucha Doors

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
and then Burlesque Triptease and Comedy and stuff like that.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
It's very well. But two shows ago,

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
sitting right to where I left

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
was Morrissey. And he looked like Morrissey.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
He looked bummed out the whole time.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Because you don't really think of Morrissey

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
as a fun time fellow. He's a creep.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
So he's a weirdo.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
But he looks great, he looks like Morrissey,

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
but a little bit older, but he still looks groovy.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
And then when the first mini comes out,

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
the first little person, because some of the wrestlers are little

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
and some are quite big,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
he has the happiest guy in town.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
And I kept...

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Blaine and I kept sneaking over

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
and taking selfies with ourselves and Morrissey.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
And Morrissey's like...

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
That's all he needed.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
All of Morrissey's cred was out the door.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
That's all he's been waiting for.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
I haven't had a dream in a long...

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Um...

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Ligents!

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
It was great. We couldn't get over it.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Blaine and I are like...

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Frequently, when famous people come,

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
we will say, oh, so-and-so is here.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
You do that Vegas thing where you say that,

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
oh, we got, you know, the guy from this band that you love

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
and the woman that directed the movie that you love.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
And we're like, do we...

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
The woman that drank in the movie that you...

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Directed the movie, get the shit out of your ears.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
And I would say, don't ever interrupt,

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
but that's what you do.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
The horse is out of the gate.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Exactly.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
No, I feel completely lost right away.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
200 episodes.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
And I don't even know what the fuck it was.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
You dressed as Jared.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Oh, yeah.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Blaine and I were like, do we do it?

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
It's getting towards the end of the show.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Do we rumble Morrissey?

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
And then we said, hey, everybody, Morrissey.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
The crowd would freak out because...

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
I don't know if you know this.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
A lot of Morrissey's fan base is very Latino,

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
especially in Los Angeles.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
A friend of mine in the bar was asking somebody,

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
he likes to come bro and he goes, dude,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
I got five Morrissey shirts.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
That's a real conversation that actually happens.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
It's true.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
It really is a thing.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
They're the most delightful stereotypes

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
in the fucking world.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
That and Tweety Bird for some reason.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
I love stereotypes that make no sense.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Tweety Bird and Morrissey.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Tweety Bird loves Morrissey.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
I saw Tweety Bird, he was wearing a Morrissey shirt.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
It's amazing.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
But we're like, do we do it?

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
If we tell the room here

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
that Morrissey is here,

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
it'll be an avalanche of people.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Because, you know, he's like their main man.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
And he was hiding kind of in the shadows.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
And right before we were about to pull the trigger,

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
he could just sense it and got up with his whole entourage

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
and just slipped out the side.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Like, well, way to go, Morrissey.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Really?

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Morrissey'd that one, didn't he?

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
I don't belong here, said Morrissey.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Slipping out.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Going out the door.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
I don't know what he sounds like.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
I've only heard Morrissey impressed.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I've never heard Morrissey.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
His song is kind of monitoring you.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I was like, oh, every song is on this note.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
And every verse is on this note.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
And remember this note.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Remember this note.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Different note, effect that note.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
This note.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Every song is the shittiest songwriter.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
And I've listened to some Morrissey songs

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
that I can kind of dig.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
But the problem with me and Morrissey

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
was I was the right age to be in high school

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
with people that were in the Morrissey

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
were just a bunch of assholes.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Who's specs?

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Not like the cool high school that I have.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Well, now apologize to the Latino community.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
And it ruined...

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
And get specific about...

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
And by alcohol for?

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
All right, Goldberg, you got another...

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
I got another hot quiz, some hot goss.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
It's called the hot cue, man.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Oh, sorry.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
This one's pretty tricky.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I got the five episodes...

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Oh, four. Let's make it four episodes.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
I don't think Dan can put them in order

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
by air date.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
So these are going to be the four episodes.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
First, wide.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Grumble snakes.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Complete access to air.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
And live at the Gramercy New York Comedy Festival

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
2015, night two.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
All right, well, complete access to air is last.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Working backwards from that.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
We'll see you next time.

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
Complete access to air is last. Working backwards from that

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
would be wide.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
And then the one that's not the Gramercy...

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Or no, then Gramercy and then whatever one's left out.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
So it would be grumble snakes,

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
wide,

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
live, complete access?

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Wait.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Grumble snakes,

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Gramercy,

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
wide...

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
No.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
This question is boiling.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
It's so hot.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Grumble snakes,

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Gramercy,

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
wide,

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
access to air.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
I want someone to get four new pets and name them those.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I mean, grumble snakes.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
The actual order was grumble snakes,

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
wide, live,

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
and then complete.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Aw, shit.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
That was a good...

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Okay, now Dan, can I combine...

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Can I combine two hot cues?

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Two hot cues that go great together.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Okay, now the hot cues,

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
just to get the terminology down,

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
you're asking the hot cues off a Twitter.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Off a Twitter.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Because they're sizzling hot,

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
they're coming off of Twitter's griddle.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Twitter's griddle.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Goldberg is asking kind of like

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
best served cold quiz questions.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Yeah, they got it.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
They've been warming up on the counter.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
They're pet cemetery flashbacks.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Let's do one more Goldberg hot quiz

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
and then I think we'll take it back to the hashtag hot cues.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
What about the two cues that went great together?

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
I'm with Spencer on this one.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
What about those?

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Goldberg's cues, these are hot cues.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Goldberg's are hot cues that got hit by a car

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
and their dad buried them

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
in a Native American burial ground

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
and now they're back, but something's different.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Alright, now.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Two hot cues, Dan.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Go ahead, Jeff.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Jeff, you acted like you were...

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Yeah, they were so good.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I got you.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
I felt bad because I was actually enjoying

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
the hot quiz and I felt bad for trying

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
to railroad back into Native American.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
We can do both.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
These cues might be so cold by now.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
I think we might have a thousand hotter cues,

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
but these are the ones I've seen.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
I'm going to combine two.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
I'm going to get this name wrong.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
At R.I. Jerk.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Rijerk, Rijerk, Rijerk.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Ask something along the lines of

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
when are you going to make this show funky

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
beats?

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
But I'm going to combine that

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
with a hotter, more recent

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
off the Twitter griddle cue

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
of

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Joel Spielberger.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Was that somebody we had in the show before?

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Joel Spielberger?

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Didn't we have him on the show before?

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
I'm just combining them.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
I didn't make Jaws, I'm Joel Spielberger.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I'm going to combine Rijerk's question

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
of when am I going to drop a funky beat

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
so that Dan starts making the show funky with...

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Are you sure you didn't say funny?

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Funky?

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
With Joel Spielberger's question

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
which is would you ask Dan

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
to do Iced Tea

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
explaining the simulation?

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
And I believe Zac McKeever

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
back here, our sound tech genius

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
extorted in there has a beat by one of

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
our loyal harmonians, right? Harry Foster?

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Let's drop that beat.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Alright, Iced Tea explaining the simulation

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
in a rap.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Boy,

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
yo

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
right about now

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
it's time to get serious

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
not that I'm ever not serious

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
but there's a thing called the simulation

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
and you can't see it when you're standing

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
in one place, son

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
because it's all around and the sound

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
of voices being simulated

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
so fuck you

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
simulation in your ass

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
yo

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
simulation in your ass

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
there once was a boy named

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
John sitting on the

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
front lawn

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
selling cracks rolling like that

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
what a fuck your mama's pussy so hot

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
she had a heart attack

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
I gotta come down from that

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
kinda surprised by my own

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
flow

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
back to the simulation

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
and then not much rhymes with that but

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
I'm not gonna sound like Iced Tea when I rhyme

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
and when I rhyme I don't

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
sound like Iced Tea that much

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
and when I sound like Iced Tea

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
I don't rhyme well

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
but I didn't sound like Iced Tea since the beginning

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
of this rap but

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
it's not personal, it's business

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
that's my

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
not gonna do it for Iced Tea

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
it brings me back to the impression

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
look at the split

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
simulation

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
not personal, not gonna do it

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
simulation

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Iced Tea Nation

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
the simulation is causing fascination

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
why? is it the matrix or are we a battery

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
well that concept don't work thermonuclearly

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
yo

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
you gotta take it to the spot

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
fuck your mama so hard and she got hot

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
your friction now that makes a charge

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
I fucked your mama like my name was

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Aldebarge

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
why?

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
it's time for the Rob Schrab Rihanna hook

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Rob can you sing the hook

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
simulation

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
simulation

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
it's not real

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
it's not not not not real

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
simulation

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
I can't declare any envy someone

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
the second matrix

55:33.000 --> 55:34.440
the second matrix one doesn't

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
then there's under Alicia

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
your mama

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
fed

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
ized like Dr. Rouch

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
expert in sexuality

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
simulating everything it's not reality

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
IE her pussy so good it aint real

55:53.000 --> 55:55.240
this a simulation that's how

55:55.240 --> 55:57.000
she feels she combs too hard

55:57.000 --> 56:03.260
To make it life. I fucked your mama sharp as a knife, but that uh, that's don't mix those images

56:06.080 --> 56:08.080
That's some seven shit

56:10.920 --> 56:16.020
I love the ladies around the street. I love the hot dogs made of all kinds of meat

56:16.900 --> 56:20.600
Simulation and it tastes good. So if you had a simulation wouldn't you

56:20.600 --> 56:25.160
Just skateboards are fun

56:26.360 --> 56:29.920
Ice cream television dinosaur stories

56:30.440 --> 56:35.020
Everything about this world is great. So plate-to-plate. You're gonna go across the nation

56:35.020 --> 56:39.920
There's nothing to hate cuz I'm having good times and swimming in pools if there was a simulation

56:39.920 --> 56:46.120
It would have three rules rule number one love iced tea rule number two. It's all about me

56:46.120 --> 56:51.200
Will number three. I made your mama pee. I fucked her so hard. She can't even see

57:16.960 --> 57:20.040
I'm so glad we're all here right now

57:21.880 --> 57:24.880
Can we give a please tell me we were recording I

57:26.320 --> 57:32.340
Started the show saying that you're that you were about it rapping good at rock and roll. No tonight. You're good at everything

57:36.640 --> 57:39.440
Does anybody here then anybody here bring a cello

57:39.440 --> 57:46.480
Can we get a little side-assist for Zac McKeever laying down the beat from our friend

57:50.720 --> 57:54.920
He was mixing with you live and doing like that doing like that like that's the thing

57:54.920 --> 57:59.240
I was gonna say is it like Zach Jack Jack drops the audio on the rhyme for the rhyme

57:59.240 --> 58:05.260
Yeah, and that's like the equivalent of like that's like the makeup airbrushing of you know, like that's that's a big deal

58:05.260 --> 58:10.880
Like that's like the that's like the foundation, but you but it was like you both knew it was gonna happen at the same time

58:10.880 --> 58:14.520
And there was a couple rhymes in there that I think are gonna last for a while. There was a

58:15.440 --> 58:21.260
There was a lot going on that way that was heavy. Um, I'd like to give special mention to the elder barge reference

58:26.200 --> 58:33.640
Because Dan's references like mine are frozen like before 89 and wait wait wait, what were what were ice tees rules?

58:33.640 --> 58:40.480
Love iced tea rule number two. It's all about me rule number three. I made your mama pee

58:40.480 --> 58:42.480
I fuck it's so hard your mama can't see

58:46.360 --> 58:50.880
Oh my god, I kind of wish I wasn't here right now

58:52.040 --> 58:57.960
I wish I wasn't here. I want to be listening in my lonely Miami apartment

58:57.960 --> 59:05.640
Shooting that weird show go all alone in my underwear and I jump up

59:06.160 --> 59:10.560
cheering if you if you had Wayne Brady on the stage, he would have been like oh fuck

59:10.560 --> 59:14.400
I put it out here. Yeah, I would get out of here. That was really good. Oh, wow

59:15.000 --> 59:21.200
It's a great worm wasn't here for that. You could have done the hooks and what a great 200. Wow, we really did it

59:21.200 --> 59:23.840
So it would be okay for the rest of the episode to suck

59:23.840 --> 59:29.280
You can just fucking hey, hey, what are we gonna do for another fifty-three minutes? Hey, here's comes

59:29.840 --> 59:31.840
Hey, fuck it up

59:32.480 --> 59:34.480
Like a reverse

59:35.240 --> 59:40.880
What did it why is he man? He just had a real big moment. Don't worry Rob. He's not real Rob

59:41.280 --> 59:48.100
What did I do in the Norman Lear episode that was I thought I was in really good. Oh my god 20 minute improvised card trick

59:48.100 --> 59:53.340
You can't improvise a card trick. You didn't even have cards. You made people make you cards

59:54.260 --> 59:59.300
That's what I do. That was before it even came out. Exactly. You don't open for fucking

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:05.720
Okay, okay Dan the Beatles Dan Daniel then it's okay

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:11.300
We've we've talked about this Rob. What did I do? What did you come on?

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:17.620
Did I do that was so bad? All right. I was really nice. I've always been nice nice to you. Oh

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:22.780
It's been nice to me. We're good friends. Yeah, I know this is not I

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:27.120
There was a couple of episodes where I was like

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:32.500
Shrom I I thought it would be a good bit to tell you the truth

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:38.700
Yeah, I wish I was there my bit right now would be to tell Schrab to shut up

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:43.420
That's that's actually what it was probably would be helpful

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:49.160
It'd be a great bit, right? We go shut up. Hey Robert

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:51.740
Robert

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:52.740
Robert

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.740
Go ahead Dan

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.340
Yeah, that'd be funny, right?

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.900
We could still do that

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:04.960
A lot of you're stay if you're not being if you're not

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:09.300
Feeling it. No, but if you're quiet, you're not like

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.080
I'm only gonna scold you when I feel like you're scaldable

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:19.000
Thank you because that that's what'll make the bit really. Thank you. Thank you

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.720
Thank you. That would be a real good idea if somebody would do that for a change

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.240
When I deserve it Robert

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:28.920
I

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.320
Yeah, see we're just testing out the bit

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:38.600
I missed a hot cue while that was the world's best rap was going on somebody somebody pitched a mid

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.680
World's best rap thing that there should have been wolves in there

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.120
Suspenser could have come up and we'll fight during that rap

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:56.040
Different animals coyotes are different wolves. I could not take on wolves. Oh, it's coyotes. Let me be real clear

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.360
That was certainly one of the highlights

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.000
I wish we could do a clip show that would be like Johnny Carson would do because that would be one of the clips would be Spencer

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.920
demonstrating how he would it is 9-11 and it's a 200th episode

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.280
It's time to talk about politics

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:20.440
That that disaster reminds me of another that the the the the but yeah, Spencer demonstrating

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:24.360
You know how he would fight off a a a gang of coyotes

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.080
He's using only a backpack and his feet

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.440
That he added he had figured it out

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:35.800
What would the concept of our clip show be what would we well that there would be that clip and then there would be like

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.600
Oh, we're all stuck in the nerd milk Nerdmelt attic

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:44.960
And we have to keep warm by remembering things about arm and down. Oh, right. You actually had a really really good concept for clip shows

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.040
That's why I'm asking. Yeah, well, I think that's a pretty good one

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:54.320
You could do we're cleaning up the head that mr. Meltdown. It's like you're about to clean up the attic

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.040
Did I name myself mr. Meltdown itself fulfilling prophecy? Oh god

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.760
I feel like I should be just a whole montage of Anatoly's shirts. Yes

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:12.320
Yeah, we're watching Anatoly's posture change from like Yakov Smirnoff to fucking like like

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:18.000
I'd Dracula like where he was just like his feet were up at the back of the stage

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.200
Resputing

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:27.520
Enti is here. Yeah, but it is kind of like my girlfriend. She's not well. Yeah, she's kind of like my girlfriend

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.680
But I won different and he's also kind of similar to my girlfriend and that you're not much of a showman

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:40.400
I'm just saying like I like to I'm big fan of the show and I I like connecting with people that I've heard their names

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:45.000
And you're one of them and what do you come up and just sit just for a second

01:03:53.840 --> 01:04:01.120
So, you know me I didn't mean to do it. I do know you. Oh, I do know you so you started coming coming pretty early in the run

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:07.160
Oh, oh, yeah, like four years ago. Do you always we've been doing it for four years four years

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:12.400
That was one of the guys when I met kind of cold. That's why I met Adam and Spencer. We only do 50 episodes a year

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:20.640
Yeah, yeah, we do we do less than 50 a year. That's pretty good. That's good gotta be away. We can push that envelope. I know

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.320
What does Marin do? I was just thinking we we've lost there's Dan Dan 53

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:30.680
Fuckin isn't this like episode 204 or something technically?

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.680
Oh

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.880
Jesus was

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.520
No

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.920
Spencer

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:51.400
Celebration of the equinox you guys killed the shadow people. It was great

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.320
Yeah, well, do you mean that because we did a several episodes before we actually started now

01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:02.120
There's just unreleased episodes. Oh, there are unreleased episodes is one where I got super duper drunk and probably coked up and like announced

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:08.360
My return to community you're admitting you do coke now like way before I was supposed to I think we I think I don't think we played

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.720
We should have had a lot more on aired episodes, by the way

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.560
Yeah, there was one where I went into a lot of detail explaining the whole Chevy

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.920
There's there's episodes that you haven't aired because you were they were that

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:23.560
Oh, I really want to get a hold of those

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.800
Well, I listened to because we were gonna release them at one point the last episodes

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:33.800
But I had been through so I'd like I had to go through a lot of my personas like like I had to come around to the realization

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.760
And the internet had to become the internet became everyone's life

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:41.680
There was a point when the internet was just a place where people kind of huddled even after it was only nerds

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:45.040
It was still then it was just like social misfits and it was always there

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:51.440
I'm just sounding defensive, but there was a there was a point in the in the internet's existence where it was still kind of

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:55.560
It felt okay to just sort of expose yourself or whether I wasn't like famous

01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:01.320
It's not really like like like so I would like write blogs about like like like my friends and what they were doing

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:07.120
I would never do that now because it's like it feels like ever since you weren't so aware that other people were

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.120
human

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:12.560
Looking at you. Yeah, not reading it. I don't know people were like

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:16.440
I was like aware of days of my my space like it was like oh and your wildest dreams

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:21.040
Someone would find this written on this coconut that you threw into the ocean and oh sure enough

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:26.680
There's there's my friend Kelly Oxford. She's she's she's she's responding in the comments and we're friends because she's one of the

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:30.920
Few people reading or the all my friends are reading. It's like there's 600 people reading your my space blog

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:36.160
So you're kind of like gossip girl in terms of like what you're saying. I'm assuming she gossips. I don't know

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:42.440
The the but then that and then you flash forward to like the Chevy Chase event, which was like I

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.400
I still I wasn't trying to put that on the internet. I was play that was before we started podcasting

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:53.280
I was playing it into the microphone here. I thought you know dumbly like like just let's just enjoy this for a second

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.600
And then one person was like yeah, you just enjoy it for a second

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:02.680
But and then and then I was that person here tonight. What if that person's it? Why don't you stand up?

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:09.640
It's Nick. Let's bring up Chevy Chase. But then I was like, oh, I'm affecting other people's lives

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:13.440
I have to stick to talking about myself. I can't remember why we were talking about this

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:19.160
But what was the point? Oh, no idea. I yeah lost episodes because so there's a lot

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.200
There's last episodes where it's like I'm talking about community and I'm talking about Chevy Chase

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:26.280
It was like with the community thing. It was like oh the fans are like they're getting bumped out every time

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:30.040
I open my mouth. I just want to like like don't want them to be touched by my

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.240
thing, you know, and then

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.760
That sounds like a penis. I mean they're already trapped in a van with me the least I could do is not following

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:43.280
And then the Chevy thing obviously it was like oh Jesus. Yeah, I've done enough there

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.560
So but but but in that episode I do explain explain like what happened

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:53.200
I think it's the actual episode where I played it. That was it was recorded. It's the last episode

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:57.480
Because we never had a podcast again. Anyways, I just read it on the internet episode

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:03.200
We go by itunes counting the episodes that we upload. It's our 200th episode. Yes, Spencer

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:15.320
So Spencer, what do you think happens when you die you what happens when Spencer dies?

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:18.000
What?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.560
What happens when you die you stop living do you have any insurance is what he's asking? Oh

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:27.520
Is there it's just a bloody long-term pet probably oblivion, right? I don't know

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:32.560
Hey, why why think about that? They got so much other shit to worry about

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:41.560
What you're worrying about I'm I'm writing or I know you know working on Harmon quest coming to see so I

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.520
Love that attitude. I don't care about death. I have a TV show. Yeah

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:53.960
I'll worry about death when I stop having a TV show. It makes sense. That's literally what happened

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.560
That's why he went on tour. I'm sure I'm sure King Ted didn't call for the pyramids to be made like during some big battle

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:07.120
Like like like you should kill those people and enslave those Jews and at the exact same time build giant pyramids that everyone can see

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.520
The whole time I'm sure he was like there's no more Jews to enslave. What should I do with them?

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:14.080
What if you had one of my tomb was a fucking city?

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:21.880
What if you had to navigate by all right Dan hot hot cue from Andrew Sprogue a

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:45.480
I gotta say it's Rob. Be careful. Well, I'm gonna fuck enti because yes, because he's he's sensitive

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:50.760

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:54.300
Like you should not have gone with this little damage as possible to each other

01:09:54.300 --> 01:10:04.220
Oh, no, we're gonna we're gonna we'll figure it out. We'll communicate on an emotional level and we'll get through it

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:06.060

Mean if Adam could do 40 like 50 minutes you can do 20

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:10.860
It was worth it though. Just to get a glimpse of Street Tough Entie for a second

Oh, that was a hard fuck. Oh, you took my fucking seat you Goldberg

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:22.180

I don't know who said it someone said fuck Mary kill Jeff Jeff and Jeff, but I'm gonna add what order

01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:36.140
Well, I mean you'll be easier to marry after you're dead

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.460
I

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:43.220

Just kill me then fuck marry me. What if I yeah, but what if what if fucking you could kill you?

What if someone could fuck you so hard?

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:59.420
It's so satisfying. You just you would die of pleasure. You just said that you fuck wait a pussy with a knife

01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:04.660
I wait a minute. Stop that. I

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:10.300

That's a good one. I know who you're killing

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:31.780

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:42.180
I'm gonna kill Chris Katana and fuck him after he's dead

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:49.020

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:56.220
Uh, yeah, I'll kill Schneider because I don't know him and and so then I'm marrying I

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:45.060
Because it for a while you wisely stop coming like I think everybody's

01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:50.820
Like most are you need a break? I took like a two and a half year. Yeah

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:56.740
I mean, I don't know if I learned anything. I've never tried so little to be a part of something

01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:01.700
You're already accepted

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:08.740
It's it's just um even 4h needs to have four H's

01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:14.700
Okay, now the joke did not land. It's very each like a regional thing. I did not get it

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:18.980
Oh, I didn't get that for each four ages like it's rural. Okay. All right

01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:23.460
I mean, what is it climb even though Dave Kline's turn to explain the joke to me?

Right real quick somebody asked the easiest answerable hot cue is Dave Kline in the house. Yes, of course

01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:43.820

In the scene where like as a bunch of people like like hordes men and they're eat like drinking out a big like wooden goblets

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:38.260
And they're eating like turkey legs with their hands. He's definitely a drug dealer in a Broadway musical

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:43.380
Like like like like

01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:48.140
Sets a Broadway musical set in a world where songs are illegal

01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:53.340
And and and you and you sell out you sell a black market song the drummer from

01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:02.860
Was my birth certificate

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:07.740
Is that is that don't don't woe him

01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:12.820
Well, is that is that copyrighted because if it is we might have to lift no, that's a freestyle jam

01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:18.780
I don't don't step darling. Don't step on your glasses. They fell off. They're right underneath

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:25.020
And lost one. I was I lost one leg in a intimate moment

01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:31.380
That's okay, but just don't step on your glasses. Is that what the things on glasses are called legs arms

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:35.060
Okay, they're called arms. All right. He calls him legs

01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:38.180
He's wearing a seat cover

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:45.500
He can call that whatever he wants to come they only have two things

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:49.460
I'd rather picture them having legs so that they can run around saying I don't have arms

01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:53.260
Then picturing them like pulling themselves along saying one of us

01:18:55.260 --> 01:19:04.580
I was real fortunate my first-ever film course ever was with Andrew Saris and he he had a class called musicals and he told us

01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:07.140
gentlemen and

01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:09.140
Ladies, I have one

Thing you need to know you either know how to choreograph a leg

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:20.780
Or you don't a snap into a slim gym

Yes, the iron sheet come out right after him

01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:28.100
Hit him with a folding chair

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:35.220
Dave you seem an awfully good form right now, and I think it might possibly be in charge of this giant can of fosters

01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:39.260
Oh, well, uh, I'd like to give a shout out to Australia because

01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:49.940
A nation no not New Zealand, but Australia a nation built on the social experiment of the best prisoners and minds

01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:55.460
They could get I'm just saying like I don't want to see like a lot of Australia stuff like necessarily

01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:59.860
I'm just saying like as America becomes more and more a social experiment

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:07.540
He's like we gotta give some shout outs to the social experiments of your like like like let's put the let's put the

01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:11.740
Let's put our criminals in our masterminds on an island

Yeah, because a lot of them were they weren't just like murderers or you know like thugs

01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:17.500
They're not a lot of them were in our spies

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:22.100
No, no, no

01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:31.180
I agree England made a big mistake by sending Australia all of England's koalas I know because I never got him back

01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:33.980
Yeah, oh classic, but they're much happier there

01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:37.260

Well with a with his flute of marmalade Paddington bearer Paddington bearer of 1812

01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:46.860
I want to apologize to Rob Schneider for thinking he was the guy in Corky

01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:55.340
What do I have to do to distinguish myself? Rob Schneider is Rob Schneider is fine. I

01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:57.860
Do I have to make a 500th movie?

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.940
Yeah

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:04.980
Because I will I'm Rob Schneider

Well, I mean I mean cut his fucking head off

01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:17.940
Oh Dave Kline is gripping that microphone so tightly. Well, it feels like the ball of it will smash

01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:21.900
I'm only gonna say this

01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:27.180
Well, I'm from I don't believe that for a second. No, that's just a lie

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:31.420
I'm from the East Coast and if there's something I'm known for it's definitely my grip

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:33.420
So

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:42.380
So I got a hot cue I got a hot cue. This is for the whole panel

01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:48.620
Okay, well, I did when I asked before I forgot you Dave Kline you you your mom was a dancer

01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:58.340
My my mother was the leading coloratura soprano at the New York City

01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:04.100
She was a singer. Sorry. Yeah, that's correct. She was a verbal mom was a singer. She's a singer. That's right

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:07.460
That's right. She's a muse for the spirits

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:15.420
She was a conduit for all the light in the universe could ever be fucking precisely put in one person's body

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:22.260
That's all my mama was. Yeah, that's right. I know a hundred were you you did you actually go to?

01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:29.140
A dance school or was that a machine riff like you were talking about the choreography class or oh

01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:31.660
long story short, so I

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:35.260
Dropped again. I went to Jackson. I

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:43.100
Was a I was at the Brooklyn Public Defender's Office trying to like be a social justice warrior and I saw some gnarly

01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:48.500
Wait a minute, and I got back to Columbia. That's why he got to Italy

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:52.980
And I went to Italy to follow my folks to do an opera festival

01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:58.140
And I saw the glory and light of people that can like kind of put all the darkness aside

01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:03.300
Channel the fury of their spirits guys my favorite person in the world

01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:10.060
Go for it. I like I don't even know what that means like I'm fucking around with VR and guys that are doing 360

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:14.660

Oh, I gotta say Rob. You're like angry. I can't even handle this guy's so great

01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:27.340
All I gotta say man. All I gotta say is Dan Harmon my life changed when I like

01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:34.260
When I listen to some spirits in the darkness and all I can say is you're not the only one

01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:36.740
But you're one of them and it sucks

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:40.540
It's crazy to say you're a spirit in the darkness man. You're spirit in the darkness

01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:43.700
I'm not the only one. Yeah, man. I'm not the only one

Yeah, you could be much worse. Let's bid him adieu, but one of them is interesting, but it involves

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.360
Doubling down on the onstage today of Klein. Oh, yeah, all right

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:52.960
Yo, yo, yo, yo, the problem with your raps is the next is too long

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:56.880
Dave Kline everybody

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.840
Dave Kline

Raise the skateboard was hitting the ramp. He was peeking

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:24.960

But same voice

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.880
Yo, the only problem with your raps is that the next is too long

01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:02.240
Yo, my girl says that the problem with me is that my eyes so long is long

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:08.800
This is a similar evolutionary problem that my friends see

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:17.440
Because everyone that I see is part of evolutionary biology

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:21.360
Taxes

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.360
Plate mail

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.240
Acts on the wall

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.840
Dave Kline everybody

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:37.600
A rare encore we don't we don't normally do encore is here

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.760
Fantastic man-o-man

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:46.240
Poor enti

01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:00.880
Temperature. No, I think you're making good choices. I'm not questioning them. Yeah, look

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:06.480
You're a great comp charlotte if I if the whole audience was made up of Jeff Davis says that would have gone on forever

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:11.360
Simply as you know because I love Dave Kline

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:16.160
Hey, hey, it looks like we're a bar, but we we have nothing to sell here

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:22.240
We're just there's ice over here. Yeah, there's ice over there not a little bit cold water in your drink

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:25.760
I know it makes no sense that the ice would be there instead of the table

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:28.400
I don't know why it keeps the bike over there

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.320
Yeah

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:37.680

01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:42.560
Because I think you provide the show can't just be like fucking you just go like

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:45.760
And then and then somebody goes like oh, you know what he did

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:51.200
And now you're like like wait slow everything stop stop stop the show. What do you mean by that?

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:56.480
That's insane. You can't now do no you can't do that. I just did it. No

01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.200

01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:48.800
It's for my he's not gonna put it together. I was I was wondering how you're such a fan of the show

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:52.240
I there's there was a 50 50 chance that you knew every word to it. Oh

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:56.240
No, I don't okay. There's no way, but I know what you're telling now

01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:00.960
I fast forward over the songs too. Get used to it

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:05.440
That one is that the one that was like to music

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.840

01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:16.800
No, that was robbs because that was yeah, I I didn't add the music somebody else one of our harmonians did that

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:21.120
Oh, that was great. That is there is there a is there a superfan?

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:26.320
I don't want to presume you're a superfan. Maybe you're a casual fan with a photographic memory. Uh

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:34.480
That that one that can crank out Pringles dick for us just uh, you're worried about not being people who have

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:37.040
photographic you want to grab a mic?

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:39.040
Well, because they'll remember that shit man

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:47.680
Forgive me. I've forgotten your name Doug Doug Doug, of course Doug couldn't commit all the way to the floor with the pants

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:55.040
I knew it was going to be hot in here. So yeah, I'm jealous of those calves

01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:59.920
So, uh, do you want to give it to us?

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:05.920
What tempo do you want to do you want to do you want to give it to us like upbeat fancy like kicking kicking butt

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:08.880
You want to make it like a sad ballad? Well, how do you want to do this just regular?

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:14.880
Yeah, just give it to us. Some people call me Pringles dick, but I never really found out why

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:20.240
I don't really have a Pringles dick. I just keep my dick inside

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:26.160
I'm so happy. I keep my dick inside a Pringles can because it peeps between his teeth and tries

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:34.880
Some people call me Pringles dick, but I never really found out. No, I never found out never really found out why

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:54.560
And now I'm like, what are you doing? Yeah, what is this all about? What is this movement all about?

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:57.760
The ATF is surrounding with tanks. Yeah, I was like, maybe this is bad

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:02.880
It could be bad. That's why NT left for two and a half years

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:06.400
Yeah, what do you know? Why did you come back?

01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:15.280
Yeah, I don't know. You don't have to answer. No, why did why did Kimmy Schmidt leave the bunker? I don't know. I haven't seen the show

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:19.120
Good show

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.120

Well now okay now chicken noodle chicken noodle, uh, yeah, what's happening? I don't even know. I'm not even 100% sure. Here I am

01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:33.920
I ain't got a dick. I got a chicken noodle can. All my life

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:39.840
I've been to the can this time a chicken noodle wife chicken noodle guy come down from the mountain

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:42.320

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:52.400

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.960
No, Spencer doesn't remember his special face

01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.720
You are the most beautiful people on

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:04.400
Swear to god

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:07.760
With the documentary because we wrote that Rob Corddry on and

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:12.640
Is that in the documentary? We we sing that Dan on the heels of

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:18.160
My love of my own song that I improvise called Pringles Dick Dan was like, I want to write a song

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:20.480
So we sat there and we gave Dan peanuts raisins

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.760
We gave him all sorts of things and finally we got a chicken noodle and then Dan

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:26.480
Had started started off and he found a kernel of a song

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:30.800
That that song took us like a maybe three hours

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:35.600
I mean hour to write the Beatles took less time to craft. Hey, Jude

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:39.360
And that song is almost like an hour long

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.920
But when we got it, we knew that we'd had some you guys nailed it

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:48.400
I've been working on lyrics for the song that I used for my alarm

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:56.960
Uh, it's the it's it's uh, let's see. What's the quick way to go to sounds and then uh

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.240
I could look for it

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:05.200
There's ringtone text tone. Do you want me to look for it while you keep the show?

01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:10.480
Well while Dan's doing that uh, uh, Spencer a lot of the hot cues are about missing the game mastering and uh,

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.200
Oh, fuck you

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:16.400
Here's some fuck cues

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:18.400
Fuck you

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:24.160
Schrab you haven't blinked for about 35 seconds

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.600
That's amazing. I know

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:34.240
I don't think I can do it anymore. You don't blink a lot. Do you know? Well, you're not a guy who blinks

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:39.600
You're not blinker. Well Schrab just told me that he took uh, he took some mushrooms from his freezer not long ago

01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:41.680
So he might not be linking

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:44.800
I'm sorry

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:47.120
They they they they were probably old and

01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:54.400
They probably not they probably probably didn't do anything. Doesn't your mom watch this show?

01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:01.520
Her his mom's cool. Yeah, my mom's right. His mom's cool. She's down

Yeah, her mom fucks with that shit

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:12.960
T she put him in the freezer. Yeah, how do you how do you find the thing that you use when you're alarm when you're actual alarm

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.680
Is it just in the alarm set because it's not in the setting just take your time

01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:18.480
Just take your time take your time

01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:21.760
Everything you need is right in this little thing too, right?

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:25.840
Wait, what's the gal in the front row that loves technology, but doesn't like to use it

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:31.040
Can you find would you help Dan? What's your name by the way my alarm sound? Are you the it department?

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.160
It's the one that when I set an alarm

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.760
Is this what your underwear looks like Dan?

01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:42.400
Look at his like the top hat. Look at his pictures. Look at his pictures

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:47.440
Whenever I set an alarm that to wake me up, you know, this is your chance. It uses a

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:52.000
Think it's not available in the uh, what are you doing? Look at his pictures

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:58.320
Just go right don't look at his picture. That's sounds like it could do not look at his picture

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:02.080
Do you look at his picture? You just blew that. Yeah

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:10.080
You had Dan Harmon's phone in your hand. Yeah, okay. That's okay. You can just scrolled so fast through all of his pictures

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.800
It's seen some weird shit

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:16.160
So it's I hear you it's this song

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:21.840
You guys know this one

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:29.920
So I try I I'm still working on it. It sounds like a Gary Gary

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:37.440
Wait, okay. You okay. There's not a lot of coordination happening and I don't blame us. We just the alarm again

So what do you guys want to do? Okay, here we go. So stop don't after all that I fucking missed it

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:26.080
But actually it's not true because it what it did is

01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:29.120
Yeah

Play that through the system. No

01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:59.920
Just just like it would go a lot shorter if it wasn't hilarious to talk about it. All right

01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:02.160
Let's just do it

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.160

I want you to get this right start it again start again get this right

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:10.080
I have to know

01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:16.560
You you realize how high you've raised the stakes now

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:24.080
That first little couplet well, I also don't have yeah, I know it's like well, it's like it's okay. All right

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:28.160
All right, but it's not it's not don't it's not going right. I think I think what I'm waking up in the morning

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:31.760
I'm hearing it different because it doesn't sound like it's working right. It's like it's like

01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:36.160
Work it out when you sleep it. I'm cool. When you put oh, it's all right. Sorry. Okay

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:45.200
I'm creeping when you're sleeping. I'm snooping when you're pooping. I'm stealing when you're peeing

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:48.160
I'm all in alley open. I'm I can't I

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:53.200
Now don't applaud it's not don't

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:56.880
I'm sorry. I'll work on it. I'll work on it and

01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:01.600
I have all kinds of stuff that I need to do and I'm sorry you need to finish that song for us

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:04.880
I don't even think it's the right melody. I think I think that the one I'm hearing in my head

01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:08.080
I can just write an original song. Can you do acapella now that you kind of got the idea?

01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:13.760
I just know it should be like like I'm I'm I'm creeping when you're sleeping. I'm snooping when you're pooping

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.040
I see you and what you're peeing. I'm and then I and then I need something like like like like like like

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:24.320
Like you know, like like like like like like like I'm I'm flat a mirror in Putin. I don't know

01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:30.320
Like I need something like it needs to rhyme with like the why are you saying you still you this is a working progress. Yeah

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:32.000
Yeah, yeah

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:38.400
I'm also like I like like I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm loading and I'm shooting because it because it's like also like

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:42.960
The subject is that it's a very pleasant song, but it's clearly about some creepy man who's like in your apartment

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
I'm creeping when you're sleeping

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:50.560
What's that?

01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:57.120
Bear back bear back like Putin. I'm I'm I am where you're drooping. I'm that's gross

01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:59.120
Yeah

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:01.920
Yeah

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:05.440
Does it have to rhyme? I probably shouldn't have welcomed you guys into it

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:11.520
That'd be a lot easier. It's a work in progress. What I'm smelling what you're tooting. I like that. Okay

01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:15.520
Smelling but you don't mind the not true rhyme of open and open and then

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:22.000
Oh, yeah, no, I don't mind the not true rhyme. I mind the the rhyme that your soul recognizes as a rhyme

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:27.040
All right, not based on some fucking pedantic horrible. We're Jeff. What happened to you, right?

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:32.080
It's about sound you hear with your soul that with your lexicon. Okay, Jeff

Harmonians were listening and they were very mad about the fact that koalas aren't bears and that nobody drinks fosters there

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:41.840
There's is there are big bears the marsupials. I'm still calling them bears. I don't get a marsupial bear

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.440
Everybody knows they're marsupials. I didn't know that you couldn't be a marsupial bear

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:48.320
I kept the thing of marsupial is like a cat like a quality

01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:53.040
But of course, it's probably like a it's a family now or something. It's like uh, it's a whole bit

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:57.920
Gangaroo bears too. What are you gonna do? You're you're the other side of the world

01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:02.960
But there's come get me. There's marsupial mammals of all kinds of like, you know

01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:08.960
I mean look at the difference between those guys. You can't blame me. It's not like they all look the same marsupials things with

01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:11.040
Yeah, you got a point. Yeah, thank you

01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:14.960
They're vicious koalas are vicious down there. I hear

01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:20.240
Vicious also, they don't cut it with them. They don't put shrimps on the barbie. They put prawns on them

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:24.720
Do they put anything on a barbie? Did they call it a barbie? Are you Ozzy?

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:29.840
A little bit now. Do you say barbie or is that does that even too ridiculous?

01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:32.640
You say barbie

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:33.680
prawns

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:34.880
Yeah, there you are

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:36.720
You know, I love about

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:42.880
The australians and the english get away with this when you say like, I know a guy we would say

01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:45.440
Oh, I know this guy

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:48.320
I mean you can get away with that on tv

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:52.640
That's one thing that's one thing that's one thing the other thing is

01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:57.920
You say like, oh, I know this guy's he's we would say he's named derrick

01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:02.320
And you would say he's called derrick like he's called derrick

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:06.320
I would I would love to be able to say that

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:09.920
You you just did

01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:14.720
No, but as an example, but I can't just say that normally right well because people would go

01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:18.640
What do you think? Yeah, that would be an affectation like they would they would they would well

01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:25.040
They would sense some kind of strange other meaning. Well, it would be and I would be affecting it right to they'd be right

01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:29.280
You called them a cunt like you would be saying a different thing depending on where you were I'd be

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:34.640
It is it can be what the the c-word. Yeah, you guys what are you called?

01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:39.760
Yeah, it's like it's like it's like it's just funny

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:45.600
It's kind of like what like like we've managed to co-opt bitch into like you can say it misogynistically

01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:50.640
But you but bitch can also just be like yeah, like you can use it more innocently. I think the c-word you could say

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:55.040
Everywhere but america they're more comfortable. It's like it's like a little rugby doll

01:49:55.040 --> 01:50:01.440
My seven-year-old my seven-year-old daughter is just like she really is a great cunt. She's

01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:04.880
Speaking of cunt

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:08.320
No, that's fuck you guys

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.440
No, cool

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:13.440
No, you forced me into that

01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:17.600
You forced me into that and that was a cheap joke and I take it back

01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:20.240
But you still laughed

01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:22.240
Um

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:29.280
My daughter's obsessed with uh curse words right now. She's obsessed with it and the other night she was like

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:32.160
uh, you know

01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:39.280
Me and my wife were there and given put her to bed and you're like, you know, we if we have thoughts in our head

01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:42.160
We think something in our head. It's okay

01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:44.880
I'm like, yes, you she knows it's a simulation

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:49.200
That's what I'm getting at. That's what I'm getting at

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:52.880
She's like, yes, you can think anything you want

01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:58.480
You can think anything but you just can't say certain things like the f word

01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:04.080
And we're like, yeah, that's right. That's right. You can't you can't say the f word

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:07.440
You just can't say it's rude and she's like

01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:10.240
But you can think it

01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:16.960
You're like, yeah, you can think it. She's like, for instance, I'm thinking it right now

01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:28.560
I'm thinking it when I say it's lugal heart. Yeah, and today she just said, you know, dad daddy the the the worst

01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:31.280
curse word is the

01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:33.200
mf

01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:36.160
Because yeah, that's a really bad one

01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:40.800
But I was like when she said that I was like, oh, she has no idea about the c word

01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:49.760
She she's never even had the kids in her school don't even haven't even been exposed to that word yet

01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:54.320
Yeah, wait until she learns the other boy. It's like just counting the minutes

01:51:55.520 --> 01:52:00.320
If you if you hang out with it with Aussies or Keeley's or like or the brits, you know, I think from uk like like

01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:02.800
See where it's like every it's like it's like it's pepper

01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:04.800
Yeah

01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:10.320
They put it on everything. It's the best. Yeah. Yeah, it's like it's like that HP sauce they use it's like the same thing

01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:12.480
Yeah, just give me some

01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:17.840
HP in Australia. It's delicious. Uh, yeah, it's funny that you see your kid

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:25.760
Like she she's learning about societal hypocrisy. Now she's gonna unlearn it and by the time she's like 15 or something

01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:31.520
Like like like we get brainwashed by society. Yeah, she'll be like like we're all geniuses when we're two

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:34.720
Like we know everyone's full of shit. That's why we're stressing like

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:41.920
The whole the lesson is like you can think whatever you want in your head. Yeah, like it has nothing to do with curse words

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:44.320
She's just having fun with it. She's just like isn't that funny?

01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:50.160
Like like 20 years from now. She's she's not even gonna it's just like isn't that the reason I want to kill myself

01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:57.680
Because all of society is based on thinking one thing and saying another and it's fucking it's spiral until you die

01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:03.120
Like like and right now she's like that seems fun. I'll do that for 70 years and you're like you have no idea

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:05.200
It's gonna it's gonna drive you insane

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:12.560
You're gonna like language is going to lose all meaning to you and and and connection will become

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:16.880
A miracle it will become something that acts happens accidentally

01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:21.680
Uh, and uh, yeah and is abused Harmon. That's what I feel like. Sorry. She was getting that

01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:28.320

Do you want to give it one more crack?

01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:48.160
All right, well, just play it for a couple then let me see if I can because I don't think I I don't think I

01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:52.560
I don't think it's working though. I need to I need to really figure it out and I don't think it's

01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:56.480
I think it's it's like I hear a different one in my head because I'm listening to it. I'm like it doesn't work

01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:01.200
But it doesn't you know what it's not gonna work. I'm crying

01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:38.640
You wake up to that

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:41.200
The thing is I'm gonna go I'm just gonna stay in bed and just keep listening to that

01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.840
Hey, what was the elf song?

01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:49.040
Uh way back. There was a song that he sang about I'm a

01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:54.000
Fucking elf or something. Tay Dixon. Tay Dixon. Yes

01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:56.800
Do you have that? I don't know. I mean

01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:03.680
The tiny show promoter. I don't have it on here. Wake that up. That'll be a treat. Well, yeah, but I don't I mean

01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:09.520
Tay Dixon. Yeah, but I don't I don't know that was a little highlight. Yeah. Well, I yeah, you had a good game that night

01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:12.560
I I don't remember anything. I mean, we don't have to

01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:15.920
We can I was playing the back

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
The other thing I want to

01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:24.240
Come to the show and I'm three feet tall. I didn't do any show promoter and I'm three feet tall

01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:29.440
That was a goodie

01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:35.200
And I also vow that that this financial quarter before we do our next and within the next 200 episodes

01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:38.640
I will also write lyrics to the popcorn song hot butter popcorn

01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:40.640
Uh

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:46.400
I know it's just something like all all the all these kernels gotta pop

01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:51.920
All this popcorn never stops when you've got the popcorn. You cannot stop corn and and something's like

01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:58.080
Oh, I'm gonna figure it out. You cannot stop corn. Yeah, it's not just popcorn. It's the cannot stop corn. I like that

01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:04.240
That's good. A lot to look forward to when you pop the popcorn. You cannot stop corn. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. Yeah

01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:07.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:12.080
Why broom when you can mop the that's a stupid. All right, we'll figure it out, but it's going to take years

01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:16.080
Yeah, uh, and since apparently there's only 50 episodes in a year. I got plenty of time

01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:20.560
I think I'm almost certain I said this if I said it on the show it would have been a very long time ago

01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:22.800
But you know, you're rapping when you're around around the house

01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:25.040
Yeah, we're talking about this when you're cleaning the house

01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:30.160
You're making a sandwich and you're rapping and you're doing it and it's also how much I have a game where how

01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:32.480
Can I embarrass myself so much that I stopped doing it?

01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:35.360
Where I'm actually ashamed that I'm watching

01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:39.040
Uh, and if anybody else was watching I would have stopped a long time ago

01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:41.920
But uh, there was one lyric when I was taking a shit

01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:47.280
And I said I ate so much poop. I ate so much food. I could poop on a dude

01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:52.000
That's pretty proud of that one. It made me laugh for a while

01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:55.920
I remember when we were we were we were you were you were rapping on the car

01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:01.520
We were doing the thing like I mean it was part of a larger thing and then you you were wrapped you were like

01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:03.520
Well

01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:07.520
Well, I like I like to eat poop. I eat it every day

01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:12.880
Or if I like my poo poo, I'll eat it every day. And if you take my poo poo, this is what I'll say

01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:16.800
I want my poo poo back. I want my poo poo back. I'm about to have a lack of poo poo heart attack

01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:21.920
I'm about to have a lack of poo poo heart attack. All right. Well

01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:24.880
Oh, I've got skills

01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:28.800
Well, that was let's close our 200th episode and our and our

01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:36.080
It's uh, uh, uh, and that's it with uh, with uh, with some kind of some kind of well, uh, exactly

01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:38.480
high-risk high yield

01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:40.720
Oh, yeah

01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:46.160
This is an all skate. Oh, it's been good to you. Been good to you, baby

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:49.360
I'll make your body go

01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:52.080
Yeah, make your body go

01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:55.360
Yeah, make your body go

01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:57.360
Yeah, I'll make your body go

01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:00.800
I'll make your body go

01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:03.360
Like a toy car

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:11.680
Until you hit the stars. I wind it up like a penny racer. I fucked you so hard that it wasn't a racer

01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:15.120
It made you stop existing. We were in a simulation

01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:17.840
I fucked you so hard you gave

01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:22.000
Achievillation, I made you food. I made you PB and J

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:28.560
I fucked you so hard you turned into curds and way. You sat on a tuffet. Well, your name was Miss Muffet's

01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:31.360
came down and everybody said but he said fuck it

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:37.600
You said mother goose trying to broom. I fucked your mama so hard. I made room in her womb

01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:41.040
And then I went inside and saw myself

01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:47.200
I put a china bowl up on a shelf. I'm a collector of rare antiquities

01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:49.440
I fucked your mama so hard

01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:51.680
through three titties

01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:53.120
for her

01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:54.640
But I'm myself

01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:56.640
I'm a clone

01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:57.920
projects

01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:01.280
In a sci-fi movie that takes place in the near future

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:04.080
Let me start over

01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:12.240
It's gonna be so long since you lay your body down. I don't know how long it's been. What about when I fuck you

01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:14.560
It's gonna be in the morning

01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:20.400
Every day until the break of dawn. My name is Tony. I'm your friend. I know

01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:26.960
I'm here to the bitter end Tony. Don't be defensive. I always want to hang out with you

01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:33.520
You are you're in the studio. Yeah, but when I'm not working and interrupting your songs

01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:36.400
You never called me. We're busy

01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:43.520
Um, I'm obviously an analog for Rob's job. I know the metaphor is pretty thin

01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:48.240
I'm over here. I just want some of your attention

01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:51.760
But do you want my respect or is ESP?

01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:56.960
I forgot how to spell it. You can't spell respect. It's spelled in a famous song

01:59:57.520 --> 02:00:01.760
And it's not that hard a word and it's also spelled in a famous song

02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:06.240
Yo, yo, Tony, take it easy

02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:09.840
Saying that never makes people take it easy

02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:12.880
All right, take it easy

02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:15.440
It's it's a tick

02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:17.440
Finally you admit you have problems too

02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:19.440
Yeah

02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:26.880
I've been back in the day. I used to miss you, but now I miss you in a different way when I'm going from town to town

02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:34.320
And I'm on tour start to feel for the old days. You know that this suit is your it tastes so good in my mouth

02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:37.920
The deconstructed boys pea soup is from the south

02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:44.880
Make it changing. They put black peas in it. I don't even want to do it. I'm on my knees swimming

02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:51.600
I'm asking you why am I at the bottom of this or maybe baby want to come on me to the piss of the toilet

02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:54.560
The most people in Harmontown we're here to say that

02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:58.000
Only one great rap song can be in the same show

02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:01.360
Wait, no, give it a chance. It's gonna get good. It's gonna get good

02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:07.680
A way of contest wouldn't a great rap right now have taken away from the glory of the greater rap

02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:10.320
It's in the first act of our show

02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:23.120
Spittin bad science, spittin chemistry, spittin chemistry, spittin an orchard, spittin an orchard, spittin a field, spittin how I work, spittin how I feel

02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:26.320
When we were children we would see a lightning bug flying through the park

02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:29.920
And you would capture that lightning bug and you would say mommy daddy look

02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:36.080
I'd capture a lightning bug and they would say put it in a jar and you would say no. I want to let the lightning bug fly away

02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:41.760
Fuck lightning bugs in a jar and the lightning bug would fly away and you'd say mother fuckers should have put that thing in a jar

02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:43.760
I'm never gonna catch one again for the rest of my life

02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:47.040
That's this rap right now

02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:49.520
And we're gonna give it up for Dan Armin

02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:51.840
200 episodes

02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:58.480
Capture that lightning bug then capture the lightning bug

02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:05.520
Let's go let's go. All right, everybody. Let's go Dan Armin

02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:12.080
Lay it down. What's the greatest fucking raps ever. Steve Levy is actually hype-meeting you right now. He's actually doing it

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:18.480
Play the play the music and stop doing the bit about how bad the rap is. Play the music

02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:22.880
It would only ever help. Everybody was telling me to stop it. I tried to help it out. All right

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Okay, here we go. All right now hype man

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:33.680
All right, everybody one more time for Dan Armin. Let's go. This motherfucker's gonna lay down some crazy raps

02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:44.000
Sky, floor, walls, ceiling

02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:48.880
Emotions, our feelings, nose, our synonyms

02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:51.600
Salt, pepper, cinnamon

02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:57.840
Put it on your soup, put it on your pizza, put it everywhere where you think it needs a bit of spice

02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:04.000
It wouldn't be nice if you're in the kitchen cooking twice, cooking three times, four times more

02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:08.960
Now you've cooked a total of ten times. S'mores, hot chocolate with marshmallow

02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:14.240
I fucked your mama and she said hello. I said you did that in the wrong order

02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:17.360
You're supposed to greet me before I border with you

02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:23.920
She said border with me. I said yeah, she said okay put a pin in it. I said okay

02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:26.880
I'm gonna go outside

02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:31.920
So I went outside and I saw a dog. I took it up a tree and cut down a log

02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:34.400
The dog died because the tree fell down

02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:36.960
And I buried it and then I frowned

02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:40.960
I read the bible. I saw the light. I took your mama outside

02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:47.040
But tonight I bought her dinner. I bought her soup. I told your mama I have to poop

02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:54.000
I went to the bathroom. I defecated. I came outside and I said I hated pooping. She said why?

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.200
I said it hurt. She said I should take you to a doctor. I said word

02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:02.720
She took me all the way downtown. The doctor said for you now my heart said you're gonna die

02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:07.760
I said why? He said MRI. We're gonna find out why. We're gonna look at your eye

02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:11.360
We'll look at my retina. You said you got cancer. I said what did I do?

02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:14.880
He said you're a dancer. You dance too hard. Your feet went into your heart

02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:21.360
You're a little, I did I got you so far. I said what? I said what? Slow down. You're talking too fast. He said I'm a doctor

02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:27.280
My words don't last. I said they're almost changing the lexicon of the of the of the diagnostic manual

02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:32.480
Man, I said let's go down. I'm out of breath. He said that's why you're gonna die to death

02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:37.360
And I said I'm gonna die to death. He said yeah, it's a bread. I said I ate some bread and I died. Now I'm dead

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:43.280
I went to heaven. There was a simulation. I saw God and I said hey, what was I was what were you doing?

02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:47.360
And he said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, don't come up at me like that. I said I'm sorry. I didn't try

02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:52.880
He said I'm God. G-O-D. I've created the earth. You're welcome from me

02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:57.680
I made the pearly gaze to keep you out. So you gotta go back down. You got no clap

02:04:57.680 --> 02:05:03.120
St. Peter is here to keep your ass on the other side. I said fuck him. I tell his ass gets real wide

02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:07.920
And then I did it and I went inside and I was inside of St. Peter. It was like a robot suit

02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:12.080
So then I got inside heaven, but I didn't get invited. I was walking around

02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:17.840
And like I was very excited because I was like Iron Man, but I had St. Peter for a body

02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:23.040
And I took off my halo and I threw it and it was a weapon and you can do it

02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:28.400
It'll it'll come back to you like thorns shield and I bet you didn't know a halo could be wielded

02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:33.040
But I did it and I went to hell and I killed the devil and I said well

02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:35.680
Now there's no dichotomy between good and bad

02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:42.080
So now we can all go back to earth and stop being sad. We can plant trees and recycle our food

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:48.160
Not sure I don't really have a plan of action after ending dichotomy

02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:55.920
200 episodes. One, two, three. 200 episodes. You've all done with me. 200 episodes. Four, five, six.

02:05:56.400 --> 02:06:01.360
200 episodes. Full of balls and dicks. We've been through it. We've got on to the other side.

02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:06.240
We've learned things. We've learned of races. Why? We've learned of misogynist. I go over that.

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:09.120
I've made friends with lesbians and I can't even top that.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.080
Now I'm friends with everybody. I used to be a fat white person. Now I'm somebody.

02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:18.880
I'm a kid but I'm woke. I'm going to cry and then choke.

02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:32.720
Everybody. I'm going to cry and then I'm going to choke. 200 episodes. 200 episodes.

02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:37.840
Thank you for coming to Heartland Town, everybody. Thank you for coming along this journey with us.

02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:04.880
