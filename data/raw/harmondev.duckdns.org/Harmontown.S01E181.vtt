An exciting new special edition of Harmontown.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:49.000\nThat might be a discomfortingly feasible this far south, I don't know.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:53.000\nIt's going to be the only Harmontown I won't say nigger in.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:57.000\nOh, Jesus.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:00.000\nI said I won't.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:02.000\nJesus.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:06.000\nYeah, I'm moving on.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:11.000\nWe have different philosophies about the use of that word.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:16.000\nI only use it while freestyling in my kitchen.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:20.000\nOr with pet names with women.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:24.000\nIt's true, I'll come clean about that stuff, but yeah.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:27.000\nFor me, it's not like it's an evil word.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:30.000\nI don't believe in hocus pocus, like words are bad and all that stuff.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:33.000\nI believe in social...\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:39.000\nI put myself in the shoes of a person of color.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:45.000\nI wouldn't want to be put in a position where people are always having to look to check with you.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nDon't put that on me, that's why I know.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:50.000\nI just hate black people.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:53.000\nI wish I didn't because they're great.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:59.000\nThey're amazing people, but I can't open.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:03.000\nMaybe we'll have one up later and we'll try to get you through this.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nI would love to learn.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:08.000\nI'm always open to things. I'm open.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:14.000\nI kind of thought this will be easy because these are my people.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:18.000\nBut I'm just realizing now I got nothing.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:23.000\nSeriously, I really have nothing because where's my...\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:26.000\nWhat did you say, sir?\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:29.000\nSorry, can I say it again?\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:32.000\nWhere's Ty?\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\nTy, you're talking about Ty...\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:40.000\nTy Brigston, the world's smallest show promoter.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:43.000\nIt's a little character that we did on the show once.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:48.000\nI don't know if you ever talked about this, but remember when I was talking about giving a transvestite a blowjob?\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nYes, I did talk about that.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:58.000\nBut I will say I listened to the recording and I did a bad job of relaying what the humor of it was.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:07.000\nI was talking about blowing this and I didn't know if it was a guy or a girl.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:10.000\nI said I don't want to be Archie Bunker here.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:16.000\nWell, talking about making love to a transgender person.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:18.000\nWhich is funny.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nAnd then you did a funny Archie Bunker imitation.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nGeez, a meathead.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:24.000\nYeah, I did it off of them too. They didn't like it.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:28.000\nThey're young and they're like, first of all, what is Archie Bunker?\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:31.000\nSecond of all, you're transphobic.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:36.000\nNot to you, it's funny and ironic because you think you're not, but to us you are.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nAnd I'm like, well...\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nI'm trying to perform for the kids.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:43.000\nYeah, no, they keep getting younger.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:47.000\nOr no, they stay the same age and we keep getting older.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:50.000\nNo, I don't, where's my notes?\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:56.000\nWe drove into, what do you call it, Miami.\n\n05:56.000 --> 06:00.000\nToday, we wanted to listen to the Will Smith song.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nHe made a whole...\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:05.000\nHe made a rapping song about Miami.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nHe's a good rapper that Will Smith. I think he really...\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:11.000\nHe should have stuck with that. I don't know what happened.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nHe's a talented person.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nYeah.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.000\nI hear he's great.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:20.000\nI don't like him.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:25.000\nYou guys may be too young to remember this, but he was on Barbara Walters once.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:31.000\nLike on the heels of Independence Day, it's like, Will Smith, taking over the world by storm.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nI'm sitting with him now.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:37.000\nI think in the interview, she's like, so you have an interesting theory about AIDS.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:39.000\nAnd he's like, oh, yeah, yeah.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nShe's like, tell it to us.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:45.000\nShe's just like, stringing them out, stringing them along.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\nAnd he's like, well, it's...\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:54.000\nYou know, you can't tell me that that disease was not created by the government.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.000\nAnd she's like, really?\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nI think a lot of people can tell you that.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:02.000\nBut he just like, he went for it.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:05.000\nHe's one of the only people that I could think of.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:08.000\nBecause like, Beck, his parents are Scientologists.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nAnd he's just being respectful.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nLike, I'm sure you guys are big fans of...\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nJudaism.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nJudaism.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nEveryone's like, who isn't a big fan?\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nEven if by proxy through, it's sequel.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nA Christianity.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nBut...\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:28.000\nNo, who's the guy that we lost the Hugo Award to?\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:31.000\nHe's the Josh Wheaton of sci-fi.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nSo is Josh Wheaton.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nNeil Gaiman.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nNeil Gaiman is a...\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:39.000\nI really actually...\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nBecause I had heard he's a Scientologist.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:44.000\nI was actually really touched by looking into it.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nYeah, well, he's not...\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:48.000\nHis parents are...\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:51.000\nListen, hold up. Just let him talk.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nYeah, Dan, let him talk.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:56.000\nHis parents are, and he's respectful of the...\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:00.000\nIt's like the same way I'm Lutheran, which I am not.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nHow do you be Lutheran or not?\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nLike, it's like I don't...\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nMy parents are Lutheran.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nI thought that was sweet.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nThere's a lot of people like that.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nYou're like, oh, he is? I respected that person.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nWhat do you mean they are?\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nAnd I'm not...\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nBy the way, if there's a Scientologist in here,\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nI'm sure you're already offended and there's nothing I can do about that.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nBut I...\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:24.000\nBut I truthfully don't.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nI mean, whatever.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nI'm not going to explain that.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:33.000\nTo us, like the people that pay less for religion,\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nlike we find it funny and it's funny.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nTo us, but we also recognize, I'm sure,\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.000\nbecause we're open-minded people that we shouldn't...\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nWe don't want you to be different.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:47.000\nWe hope you're very happy.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:52.000\nAnyways, Will Smith is the only famous Scientologist I know of\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nwho I think is...\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nJohn Travolta was...\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nBefore he auditioned for Welcome Back Clodder,\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nhe was a Scientologist.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nThere's a story about him being in an acting class\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nin the Celebrity Center or whatever\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nand going, I got this...\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nI got an audition later today.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:12.000\nIt's for something called Welcome Back Clodder.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nAnd the teacher being like,\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:18.000\neveryone, I want you to point in the direction of Paramount Studios\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nwhere Jonathan has his audition today.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:24.000\nAnd I want you to beam your UFO energies.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:27.000\nI was at your show and I'm a Scientologist\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nand you called it UFO energy.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nYou keep it a secret.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nSo I don't know what it is.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:36.000\nBeam your xenons over to the Paramounts.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:39.000\nAnd my point being that everybody's like,\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nthey're in it when they're younger\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nand their career takes off.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:46.000\nBut Will Smith is the one guy that was like,\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nhe woke up, he had all the money in the world,\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nhe had all the success.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nHe was like, there's still something missing.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nHe's like, oh, this is great.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nThat's notable to me.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:59.000\nBut you, you, you...\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nSpencer, you...\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nMe.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nSpencer picked...\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nI hope this becomes a thing for him.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:09.000\nSpencer picked up on this thing that Will Smith does\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nin all his rap.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:17.000\nThis really confident, insincere laugh.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:20.000\nHa, ha, ha, ha.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nWill Smith always, in his raps,\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:26.000\nhe always sounds like he's jumping in through a French window\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nwith a rose in his teeth.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nHa, ha.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nAnd he has this, he has this rap,\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nbecause we listened to the Miami song,\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nand we're like, this is worse than I remember,\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nbut...\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nAnd because Apple Music now just is sky-net\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nand just keeps playing.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nIt started playing all these Will Smith songs,\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:47.000\nand we heard this, this rap called, it's a freak,\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nI'm a freak, I'm gonna freak.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nI'm gonna get freaky or...\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:52.000\nFreakin' it?\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.000\nFreakin' it?\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:54.000\nFreakin' it.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nHe comes at the concept of freaking it.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nSo many different angles.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:01.000\nHis refrain is just him over,\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nhe says a million different things about freaking it,\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nlike, like, like, like, he goes like,\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nyou all don't mind if I start freaking it?\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nBut, and he's like, I don't care,\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nI don't care what you want, I'm gonna freaking it.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:12.000\nAnd then he's like,\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nhey, who here wants me to start freaking it?\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:15.000\nHe's like, what do you weigh?\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nAre you a populist or an elitist?\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:18.000\nI don't understand.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:20.000\nI was like, did you care who's listening?\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nOr did you, you're acting all like, like, like detached?\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:23.000\nBut then, you know, it's like,\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nhe just keeps saying all these different things,\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nand you can't pin him down in a position,\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:27.000\nand you don't even know what fre...\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nHe never starts freaking it, as far as we know.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nHe just, haha.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:34.000\nBut he, in this rap,\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nhe alludes to the fact,\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:39.000\nhe goes like, yeah, and I, I, I...\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nHe doesn't rap like that.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:45.000\nHe said a rap.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nIt's Christian Bale in the big short.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nThat's my, my, my, uh, camera.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:52.000\nThe, um, uh, he goes, uh,\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:55.000\nI, I, I even, I even read in the paper\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nthat somebody said I was soft.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:58.000\nYeah.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nLike, Microsoft.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nMicrosoft.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:05.000\nWhich is, it's a soft rhyme,\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\nand it's rhyming soft with soft,\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nso it's not a compelling argument, either way.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:12.000\nAnd he thinks Microsoft is hard.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:13.000\nYeah.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nAnd...\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:15.000\nA software company.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nAnd Micro means small.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nLike, if the company was mega soft.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nLike, like, like, like, a little bit.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nLike, you'd be like, okay, I guess he's like, kind of...\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nLike, you think I'm flaccid.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nI also have a little penis.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:28.000\nYeah.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:29.000\nYeah.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:30.000\nFlaccid.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.000\nMore like, more like,\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nuh, Lake Placid.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:36.000\nHaha.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:37.000\nHaha.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:41.000\nLike, it's one of our most erect lakes.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:43.000\nHaha.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:47.000\nAnyone who uses the term freaky, by the way, is not freaky.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:50.000\nYou know, like, that song, Super Freak.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:51.000\nYeah.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nYou know how he describes freaky?\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:54.000\nShe's a very sexy girl.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nIncense wine and candles?\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:57.000\nHaha.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:58.000\nThat's...\n\n12:58.000 --> 12:59.000\nYou don't know what freaky is.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.000\nThat's Playboy massage freaky.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:01.000\nYeah.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nThat's, uh, oh, yeah, yeah.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nHugh Hefner is selling the Playboy mansion.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:06.000\nOh, right.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nI'm in it, though.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nYeah.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nDid you guys hear about that?\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:11.000\nYou can buy his...\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nYou can buy the Playboy mansion for $200 million.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:14.000\nThere's a...\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.000\nBut you have to live with him.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:19.000\nYou're buying a nursing home that you have to work at.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:20.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:21.000\nI want someone to...\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:25.000\nI want, like, a millionaire to buy it and just put it in, like, a big glass dome.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:26.000\nJust like, this is...\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:27.000\nThis is Hugh Hefner.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:28.000\nI want to know, like, once he...\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:31.000\nLike, if I had $200 million, I'd be like, what...\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nCan I do anything I want with his corpse?\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nLike, after he dies?\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:36.000\nLike, is it like...\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:37.000\nIs it like Sunset Boulevard?\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:41.000\nLike, I said, did you move in and, like, he's just in one bedroom and, like, you bring up\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nsoup and leave it outside the door?\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:47.000\nWell, I think he can feed himself, but he gets the whole...\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:48.000\nHe gets the whole place.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:51.000\nLike, you can't say, you stay up here, I'll take the bottom floor.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:55.000\nNo, he's cruising into your bathroom and, like, he's doing all the stuff.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:58.000\nAnd I think it also includes, like, some of his girlfriends, too.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.000\nThey're going to be living with you.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nWhich is kind of, you know, that's classic comedy.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:08.000\nYou guys read the description, there was the whistleblower young lady who described what\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:09.000\nit...\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nFinally, after, like, 60 years of, like, oh, Hugh Hefner, does he...\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nDoes he have sex with all those women?\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:17.000\nAnd there's finally, like, there's this woman that just...\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:18.000\nShe just laid it out.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:22.000\nShe's, like, a typical knight in Hugh Hefner's house if you're one of these, like, playmates\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.000\nthat's allowed to live in a house.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nIt sounded so fucking horrible.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nLike, there was, like, a...\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:32.000\nBecause there's, like, a hierarchy, like, there's, like, a slightly...\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nThe girl with seniority is kind of, like, indoctrinating the younger women.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:38.000\nAnd it's, like, you just go in his room and he's watching porn and then you have to do\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nthe stuff and...\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nI mean, I'm all for the porn part.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:44.000\nI just, like, the idea that, like...\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:45.000\nI mean, what...\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:48.000\nAnyways, I was at the Playboy Mansion.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nIt smells like mildew.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:51.000\nIt's a...\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nYeah, how much are they selling it for?\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:56.000\nBecause whatever you're selling it for, you're going to have to pay that much just to clean\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\nout the hot tub.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:58.000\nYeah.\n\n14:58.000 --> 14:59.000\nRight?\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:00.000\nYeah.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:01.000\nIt's disgusting.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:02.000\nI already told them the podcast, the story.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nI was at the Playboy Mansion for its 50th anniversary.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nThe magazine's 15th anniversary.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:07.000\nMy encounter...\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:10.000\nMy and Rob Schrobb encountering David Hasselhoff.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.000\nWe...\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:12.000\nWe go...\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:13.000\nNow I'm going to tell it again.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:14.000\nI haven't told you...\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:15.000\nWhat number...\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:16.000\nWhat number is it?\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:17.000\nI'll listen later.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:18.000\nNo, I don't know the story.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:19.000\nI just took that story.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:20.000\nI don't care.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:21.000\nI just love going through it because it's, like...\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:22.000\nIt was just so odd.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:23.000\nI was just, like...\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:24.000\nWe got, like...\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nThere's David Hasselhoff.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nI...\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nI think it's okay to say that.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:28.000\nThe...\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:29.000\nI mean, for me it is.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:30.000\nI don't know.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:31.000\nIt's Rob.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:32.000\nRob gets high and he's directing Lego Town.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:35.000\nYou're high on incest.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.000\nThe...\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:37.000\nBut we were, like...\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:38.000\nAnd we were, like...\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:39.000\nOh, my God.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:40.000\nDavid Hasselhoff.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:41.000\nAnd I was, like...\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\nYeah, but let's not bug him.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:43.000\nAnd Rob's, like...\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:44.000\nIt's the Playboy Mansion.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nEveryone's bugged by each other.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nLike, it's, like...\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nIt's, like, corniest place.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:48.000\nAnd, like, we'll always wonder what would happen.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:49.000\nLet's go...\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:50.000\nWe got to talk to Knight Rider.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:51.000\nAnd, like...\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:52.000\nAnd we go up to him and we...\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:55.000\nAnd then he's, like, nine feet tall.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:56.000\nAnd we go, like...\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:57.000\nWe go, like, hey, we made a pilot.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:58.000\nIt was based on you.\n\n15:58.000 --> 15:59.000\nThat's what Rob said.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nHe's talking about Heat Vision and Jack.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:02.000\nAnd, uh...\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:03.000\nWhich had a talking motorcycle on it.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:04.000\nIt was very much...\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nIt was inspired by Knight Rider.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:07.000\nAnd...\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nAnd Hasselhoff goes, like...\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:10.000\nWhat?\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:11.000\nReally?\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:12.000\nUh...\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:13.000\nYeah.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:14.000\nIt was inspired by Knight Rider.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:15.000\nSo it's, like...\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:16.000\nIt's, like...\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:17.000\nIt's a valentine to you.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:18.000\nAnd he's, like...\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nWho directed that?\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nAnd we go, Ben Stiller.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:23.000\nAnd he goes, like...\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nOh, what else did he do?\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:28.000\nAnd Rob goes, Zoolander.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:35.000\nAnd David Hasselhoff goes, Zoolander's based on me?\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:38.000\nAnd I swear to God, I would be the first to self-deprecate.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nBut I'm not exaggerating this.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:45.000\nThere was a three-second pause and Rob and I in unison went, yes.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:49.000\nI walked away.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:52.000\nBecause we had gotten everything we would get.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:55.000\nBut I said, I picture him going home and watching Zoolander.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nCalling his lawyer.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:58.000\nIt is.\n\n16:58.000 --> 16:59.000\nHave you seen this?\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:00.000\nAnd he's, like...\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:03.000\nI don't know what you're talking about, David.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:04.000\nNo, it's clear.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:07.000\nOnce you point it out, it's obvious.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:12.000\nHe's telling that story on his podcast in Germany or whatever.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:15.000\nI'm in Zoolander!\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:21.000\nI had to make a tinkle before I came on stage and Dustin Marshall,\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:26.000\nour producer here from Ferrell Audio, he...\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:28.000\nHe chickened upon himself.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nWe won't go to find the bathroom together.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nWe had to walk through a lot of stuff.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:33.000\nIt was a long way.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:35.000\nThere were a couple of elevator rides.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:36.000\nIt's a long journey to find the bathroom.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:39.000\nThere's a bathroom right through that wall.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:40.000\nLike right there.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nYeah, but there's no door.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:46.000\nWe eventually found it.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nWe walked in and there was just like...\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nThere was just like four urinals along the wall.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:54.000\nDustin was like, whoa, it's like P city in here.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:58.000\nIt's like we had found the National Treasure vault.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\nIt's a P city.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nThat reminds me, I walked into the bathroom once and there was a janitor.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nHe's like, ah, fuck!\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:05.000\nI said, what's the matter?\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:09.000\nHe's like, it smells like shit and piss in here.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:12.000\nYou're a janitor in a toilet.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:20.000\nPeople who are shocked at their job time, we had this weird flight delay today.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:25.000\nWe got an airplane at LAX and I'm going to round the numbers off here.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:30.000\nI don't know the exact ones, but it's like basically four hours from Miami.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:38.000\nBut we were in the air and I guess I was asleep and so was the guy next to me.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:42.000\nOh, so first of all, sorry, let me start at the beginning,\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:45.000\nbecause I had a terrible day today.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:49.000\nFirst class American Airlines, the worst.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:50.000\nSorry.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:53.000\nNo, no, no, I'm not going to complain more about airlines.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nThese things happened on a plane.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nI'm the bad guy in most of it.\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:06.000\nI get on the plane and I'm like, my ticket says 5B.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:09.000\nAnd I look and it says aisle.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:13.000\nAnd there's a guy that's kind of like, he's got, I see on his ticket,\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:15.000\noh, I'm sorry, it says 5B on his ticket.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:16.000\nWhy is that important?\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nBecause someone's going to fact check it and go, if you were in 5B,\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nyou weren't in the aisle.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:21.000\nI won't blame you.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:24.000\nI have the same neurological disorder.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:25.000\nYou do.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:26.000\nI just don't.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:30.000\nHe's talking to himself, folks.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:33.000\nBut he's like, I can see on his ticket that it says 5B,\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:37.000\nso I know he's sitting in that aisle and I'm 5A.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:41.000\nBut he's like, he's talking to some lady that's like a row ahead.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:45.000\nAnd he, but he's going like, oh, I don't, I don't know.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nI'm in the window or whatever.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:51.000\nAnd I'm like thinking in my head, I don't care if you don't like the window.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:52.000\nYou're not going to pull one of these things.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nLike I'm just thinking that in my head.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:55.000\nAnd he's like, I don't know.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:58.000\nIt says I'm 5A, but I said it's the window.\n\n19:58.000 --> 19:59.000\nI pointed at the diagram.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:02.000\nI said there's a drawing of a guy in a window next to his head.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:06.000\nAnd there's no confusion lately.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:07.000\nAnd then he starts sitting down.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:11.000\nBut then it turns out the lady in the row ahead, she's like,\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:15.000\nit becomes clear that they're a couple and they're traveling together.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:19.000\nAnd she's like, I don't know why they would sit me up here.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nAnd I said, oh, do you want to switch seats?\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nAnd she's like, you would do that for us?\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:24.000\nI said, well, of course.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:28.000\nI mean, you know, like what, what, what, yeah, you guys sit there.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:32.000\nAnd she's like, which, thank you, thank you very much.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:40.000\nI've not since 9-11 has the bravery been acknowledged.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:43.000\nIt's God, it's God said that I was starting to get a little pissed off\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:46.000\nthat people didn't applaud.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:50.000\nThank you for, for, you know, it's like they're selfish people.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:54.000\nThey don't, they don't know heroism when they hear about it.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nBecause that was the end of my story.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:59.000\nBecause they didn't applaud, I was going to start making shit up\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:03.000\nbecause I was embarrassed for you.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:08.000\nNo, I go, I'll switch seats with you.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:12.000\nAnd I, but I specifically said, I said, so this is your seat, right?\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:16.000\nAnd I point at 4B, which is the window.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:19.000\nI'm sorry, I keep switching these letters around, but it's at 4B.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nAnd she said, yes, that's my seat.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:27.000\nAnd I go, okay, because obviously I wouldn't want to, you know,\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nscrew with whoever else is sitting or whatever.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:32.000\nBut it's like, oh, thank you so much.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:35.000\nSo she sits there in 5A next to her husband in 5B.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nAnd I go into 4B.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nAnd there's like cookie packages and shit.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nI just start like throwing shit around.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:42.000\nI've got, you know, it's my home now.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nI installed a ceiling fan.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\nIf I could, there's a pillow.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nI drew a face on it and fucked it.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:53.000\nLike I threw it out the window of the plane and like, like, like,\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:56.000\nlike rubbed my butt all over the seat to make it nice and warm.\n\n21:56.000 --> 22:01.000\nAnd then this couple comes out and they look at me and they're just like,\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nlike, they have this look on their face.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nLike, what is this homeless Kevin Smith?\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:10.000\nLike, and they're like, and I'm like, and I know the look.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:16.000\nAnd so I turn to the woman behind me and I go, did you give me someone else's seat?\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:17.000\nReally accusing.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:20.000\nI did not rise above it at all.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nAnd she was like, oh, I'm sorry.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:24.000\nWell, I don't, she holds up her ticket.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:26.000\nIt says 3B.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:28.000\nWhat are you, how are you?\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:30.000\nIf you had a whole conversation, yes.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:31.000\nThank you.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:35.000\nI think you're applauding maybe her, but...\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:38.000\nI think that person has an OCD thing.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nI don't think they're applauding for you.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nThey're flapping as I was talking about.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nYou're stimming, you're stimming.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:48.000\nThere was no connection to anything good.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nSorry, what's that?\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nTourette's.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:52.000\nTourette's, yes.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:53.000\nOkay, I'm sorry.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:56.000\nI asked what you said.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nMaybe it's possible in a strange way.\n\n22:58.000 --> 22:59.000\nYou have Tourette's.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nSounds like you have Tourette's.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.000\nHe has meta Tourette's.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:05.000\nHe just shouts the word Tourette's out.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:06.000\nHe has Tourette's.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nHe has Tourette's.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nHe has Tourette's.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:13.000\nWhoop, whoop, whoop.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:16.000\nOkay, Dan, I was at your show.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:23.000\nI'm a Scientologist with Tourette's, and I consider this my letter of resignation from\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:24.000\nyour fandom.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:28.000\nYou are really offending a lot of people tonight.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:31.000\nI get it, I get it.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:35.000\nSo I have to go all the way up to 3B.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:40.000\nThe guy in 3A, this is so late in the stage.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:45.000\nHe's thinking like, oh, shit, man, I got an empty seat next to me.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:49.000\nHe's got socks and laundry and fucking backpacks and pretzels.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:50.000\nAnd I feel bad for him.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:51.000\nI feel bad for myself.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:54.000\nIt's just a clusterfuck.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:57.000\nAnd I sit down next to him.\n\n23:57.000 --> 24:00.000\nThat's the end of that chapter of the story, but it continues.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:03.000\nIt gets so fascinating.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:09.000\nSo me and this gentleman, we fall asleep together, like next to each other on the plane.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:10.000\nAt some point.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:17.000\nSo at some point during the flight, like, we missed them saying, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:23.000\nit's so foggy in Miami that we're landing in Orlando.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:28.440\nWe both missed that announcement and just woke up at some point, and we're descending\n\n24:28.440 --> 24:35.000\non this city, and he's looking out the window, and he starts going, he goes, that's not Miami.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:45.000\nAnd I'm like, oh, yeah?\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:50.000\nCheck, please.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:54.000\nAnd I was like, what do you mean?\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:57.000\nAnd he's like, I'm serious.\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nThat's not Miami.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:06.000\nAnd I swear to God, I'm so embarrassed, obviously this ends with my comeuppance, but I was\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:08.000\nlike so, I was riding this high.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nI was like, it's so patronizing to him.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:18.000\nI was like, I think, you know, you get in a metal tube, and it goes like this for a while.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:21.000\nAnd I think it always ends up in the city you bought the ticket to.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:25.000\nIt's my experience with air travel.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:33.000\nAnd he's like, I'm from Miami, that is not Miami.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:36.000\nI said, it's a bunch of glowing lights.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:40.000\nIt's a grid of roofs.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:45.000\nI mean, maybe you have city blindness.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:49.000\nTo me, it looks like it could be Miami, it could be Copenhagen.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:54.000\nI don't judge by this distance.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:58.000\nLike you said, you wouldn't know LA.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:01.000\nI'm like, guys kind of chuckling, because I want to make it clear.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:05.000\nI'm really busting the guy's balls.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:12.000\nAnd I'm like, let's you and I, we'll land the plane, we'll get out very carefully, we'll\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:19.000\npeek out, we'll find a newspaper.\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:23.000\nAnd he's not laughing anymore, because he's like, I'm serious.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:24.000\nI'm from Miami.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:25.000\nThat's not Miami.\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nI'm like, okay, okay, okay.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:33.000\nSo then the crazy thing is, because they already told everybody, but we were asleep, they\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:41.000\ndon't then say, okay, like the plane lands in this city, and they still haven't said,\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nthey said it before, so they don't say it again.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:48.000\nThey just like land, and then they're like, okay, just hold on.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:53.000\nWe'll get everybody where they're going as soon as the problem's over.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:56.000\nWhat's happening?\n\n26:56.000 --> 27:01.000\nAfter 20 minutes, a guy walks up with his luggage to the front of the plane, and he's\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:02.000\nlike, I'm getting out.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:04.000\nI want to get out of the plane.\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:06.000\nYou can't get out of the plane.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:07.000\nYou can't.\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:10.000\nIf you get out of the plane, you're in the wrong place.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\nI'm like, what the hell, are we on the tar?\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:20.000\nI see the tube is connected, the thingy, and he's like, I have a right to get off the plane.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:28.000\nI will get a cab, and she's like, okay, but you have to just hold on a second, and she\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:32.520\ngets on the thing, and she goes, ladies and gentlemen, there are people that are wanting\n\n27:32.520 --> 27:39.000\nto get off the plane, and it's their right to do so, but it's not a good idea if you\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.840\ndo get off the plane, and I don't recommend it.\n\n27:41.840 --> 27:43.840\nDon't go far.\n\n27:43.840 --> 27:47.840\nI'm like, what the fuck is happening?\n\n27:47.840 --> 27:50.840\nIs this like Langoliers?\n\n27:50.840 --> 27:53.840\nDon't go far.\n\n27:53.840 --> 27:55.840\nDid a terrorist attack happen?\n\n27:55.840 --> 27:57.840\nDon't go far.\n\n27:57.840 --> 27:58.840\nIt's Earth.\n\n27:58.840 --> 27:59.840\nWhat do you mean, don't go far?\n\n27:59.840 --> 28:01.840\nWhat if I have family?\n\n28:01.840 --> 28:04.840\nWe're in Miami, aren't we?\n\n28:04.840 --> 28:10.840\nAnd then I was like, finally, they never said the word Orlando, and then, oh, so that guy,\n\n28:10.840 --> 28:15.840\nso she finishes shaming that guy, and then she's like, she goes, I reckon we're going\n\n28:15.840 --> 28:18.840\nto turn out the lights, and everybody should take a nap.\n\n28:18.840 --> 28:21.840\nThat's what she said.\n\n28:21.840 --> 28:30.840\nIt's like a Jonestown thing is happening, and then I said, then 28 seconds after that,\n\n28:30.840 --> 28:36.840\nbased on some visual cue, I don't know if some guy out the window was like, made like\n\n28:36.840 --> 28:38.840\na base stealing gesture or something.\n\n28:38.840 --> 28:40.840\nShe gets back in the fight.\n\n28:40.840 --> 28:43.840\nOkay, ladies and gentlemen, everybody get off the plane and don't go far.\n\n28:43.840 --> 28:45.840\nShe's like, why are you still on the plane?\n\n28:45.840 --> 28:46.840\nGet off the plane.\n\n28:46.840 --> 28:49.840\nShe started yelling at us for being on the plane.\n\n28:49.840 --> 28:50.840\nWhy are you napping?\n\n28:50.840 --> 28:51.840\nGet off.\n\n28:51.840 --> 28:53.840\nBut don't go far.\n\n28:53.840 --> 29:00.840\nAnd I got up and I put on my backpack, and I said, I don't think this is Miami.\n\n29:00.840 --> 29:05.840\nAnd the guy's like, I know.\n\n29:05.840 --> 29:07.840\nAnd we went out and it was Orlando.\n\n29:07.840 --> 29:11.840\nAnd I bought a bunch of salmon stuff.\n\n29:11.840 --> 29:13.840\nYeah, thank you.\n\n29:13.840 --> 29:14.840\nThanks, guys.\n\n29:14.840 --> 29:16.840\nThat's when you applaud.\n\n29:16.840 --> 29:17.840\nYeah.\n\n29:17.840 --> 29:23.840\nBut there was a lady, we went to a sandwich restaurant, and the woman at the sandwich\n\n29:23.840 --> 29:27.840\nrestaurant was confused and frustrated.\n\n29:27.840 --> 29:34.840\nShe couldn't believe when she got up that morning to work at her airport sandwich store.\n\n29:34.840 --> 29:43.840\nBut she's like, what she was saying was, next, what do you, what, what, what?\n\n29:43.840 --> 29:45.840\nI'll have, can I have a breakfast sandwich?\n\n29:45.840 --> 29:47.840\nWe have ham and cheese and sausage eggs.\n\n29:47.840 --> 29:50.840\nI said, I'll have ham, egg and bacon.\n\n29:50.840 --> 29:52.840\nWe have ham and cheese.\n\n29:52.840 --> 29:53.840\nWe have bacon.\n\n29:53.840 --> 29:54.840\nI fucked up.\n\n29:54.840 --> 29:56.840\nI was like, I'll have that one.\n\n29:56.840 --> 30:03.840\nAnd she's like, the unspoken part of her statement was like, how can this be happening to me?\n\n30:03.840 --> 30:09.840\nHow can a plane land next to my sandwich counter?\n\n30:09.840 --> 30:14.840\nAnd all of these hungry people are just lining up and wanting sandwiches.\n\n30:14.840 --> 30:19.840\nI come here to read.\n\n30:19.840 --> 30:21.840\nAnd I stole a bag of Doritos.\n\n30:21.840 --> 30:22.840\nYeah.\n\n30:22.840 --> 30:28.840\nI knew you guys would get that.\n\n30:28.840 --> 30:30.840\nIn LA, they'd boo that.\n\n30:30.840 --> 30:32.840\nFucking, Miami style.\n\n30:32.840 --> 30:34.840\nMiami style.\n\n30:34.840 --> 30:40.840\nThis place invented vice.\n\n30:40.840 --> 30:42.840\nAnd then I fucked a baby.\n\n30:42.840 --> 30:50.840\nAnd then I fed it to, do you have crocodiles or alligators?\n\n30:50.840 --> 30:51.840\nYeah.\n\n30:51.840 --> 30:53.840\nYou know what, it was an alligator.\n\n30:53.840 --> 30:56.840\nBut I sharpened its nose and turned it into a crocodile.\n\n30:56.840 --> 30:57.840\nI don't give a shit.\n\n30:57.840 --> 31:11.840\nI stole a bag of Doritos. I grabbed it, I opened it and just started eating it. I went up to\n\n31:11.840 --> 31:18.840\nthe counter. I waited for her to charge me for it. I was like, I'll have a sandwich. I was like,\n\n31:18.840 --> 31:26.840\nI'm stealing Doritos and I stole it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, whatever you guys are saying.\n\n31:26.840 --> 31:36.840\nTurrets! All right, Will Smith, that shit. There was one other thing I swear to God.\n\n31:36.840 --> 31:47.840\nThanks, Steve. That's Steve. Steve once. He drives down. Steve rented a car and we, well,\n\n31:47.840 --> 31:51.840\nthat's the weird thing. There's nothing funny about this, but I just find it incredibly ironic\n\n31:51.840 --> 31:58.840\nthat we got, it's a four hour flight from LA to Miami and we were then four hours from Miami\n\n31:58.840 --> 32:09.840\nby car. So had we stayed home until the fog lifted, we could have just, oh, are you guys okay?\n\n32:09.840 --> 32:16.840\nOh, did Sherlock Holmes come out? Is Jack the Ripper here? How could you hear each other\n\n32:16.840 --> 32:24.840\nover the fog horns? It must have been so foggy. I don't know why. If it's too foggy for the\n\n32:24.840 --> 32:28.840\nland, I don't know why it wasn't a big deal. Yeah, other planes landed in that timeframe,\n\n32:28.840 --> 32:35.840\nI think. He saw it. I will say, though, that's the one thing I won't complain about, though,\n\n32:35.840 --> 32:40.840\nas far as like an airline. If they're scared to land, even if it means because they think\n\n32:40.840 --> 32:48.840\nthey suck, like, I can't do fog, man. I can't do it. I'm like, don't do it, Steven. This\n\n32:48.840 --> 32:55.840\nisn't time to, I don't want to be part of your fucking coming of age story. Just land in Orlando\n\n32:55.840 --> 33:04.840\nand go back to flight school and just avoid London. Yeah, I want that guy in flight that\n\n33:04.840 --> 33:11.840\nturned the plane upside down on cocaine. Yeah, who was that guy? Yes, it was Denzel Washington.\n\n33:11.840 --> 33:18.840\nWe like that flight movie. No, there was something else. God damn it. There was something\n\n33:18.840 --> 33:28.840\nelse. Shit. Fuck. I mean, it was a doozy. Turrets. Dinosaur? Did you just say dinosaur?\n\n33:28.840 --> 33:38.840\nWhat did you say? Oh, yeah, you forgot how we stopped at that amusement park. I got chased\n\n33:38.840 --> 33:46.840\nby dinosaurs. No, I did not forget. It was a real keeper. I texted you guys, I was wondering\n\n33:46.840 --> 33:50.840\nwhere you were, and Steve texted me the name of the place, and I thought he was joking.\n\n33:50.840 --> 33:58.840\nWhat was the name of that place? Yeehaw. I'm like, come on, come on, Steve. I want to\n\n33:58.840 --> 34:07.840\nknow where you guys are. Yeehaw. Yeah, we were in Yeehaw. It was great. It had like a truck\n\n34:07.840 --> 34:13.840\nstop slash crunchy crispy chicken. What was that place called? It's a great combination\n\n34:13.840 --> 34:19.840\nof businesses. I'll tell you that. Can I get a Will Smith insincere confident laugh?\n\n34:19.840 --> 34:30.840\nIt was a great set of businesses. Ha ha ha ha. You know, he really committed to wrapping\n\n34:30.840 --> 34:34.840\nclean, especially in that freaking it. I don't know if you guys know this, but freaking it\n\n34:34.840 --> 34:41.840\nis a euphemism for fucking it. But he specifies like, I dare you to make a verse without a\n\n34:41.840 --> 34:51.840\ncurse. Like me, I'm Microsoft. Ha ha ha ha. Or like whatever. Yeah, he was pre-rape\n\n34:51.840 --> 35:00.840\nCosby-ing the listener. Before he was that kind of monster, we have now forgotten that\n\n35:00.840 --> 35:08.840\nCosby was a fan of high-roading. Yeah, he was a famous high-roader when it came to language.\n\n35:08.840 --> 35:14.840\nOh, yeah, and also pants pulling up, right? Yeah, no, he didn't like any of that nonsense.\n\n35:14.840 --> 35:23.840\nIt's not sophisticated. He liked pulling pants down, right? Yes, he did. Ha ha ha ha.\n\n35:23.840 --> 35:36.840\nAny Cosby's here? Because you guys seem a little offended by the idea of berating that\n\n35:36.840 --> 35:46.840\nguy for victimizing people. Ha ha ha ha. Be fair to him. All right. Yeah, someone said\n\n35:46.840 --> 35:52.840\nCosplay is a joke. It's a funny joke. What if you're Cosplaying Cosby? What is that?\n\n35:52.840 --> 35:59.840\nIt's Bill Cosplay. That's far too much credit. I was just filling in while you were looking\n\n35:59.840 --> 36:03.840\nat your notes. I don't know why I keep pulling out because I clearly lost my notes, but I\n\n36:03.840 --> 36:10.840\nkeep pulling out the phone like it's like a life preserver. Let's get a...\n\n36:10.840 --> 36:14.840\nWe should get a rick. We don't have a lot of... There's a lot of ricks in the audience.\n\n36:14.840 --> 36:18.840\nOh, yeah? Well, yeah, there's ricks. Lots of ricks. Let's do a rick parade.\n\n36:18.840 --> 36:25.840\nI did a signing today. There's a gazurpazurp field. Do you want to come up and show your\n\n36:25.840 --> 36:34.840\ngazurpazurpazurp? Are you shy? You can be shy if you want. It's your right. Stand, get\n\n36:34.840 --> 36:44.840\nup on the stage. Get her some darn enchiladas. You're the girl with the weird tattoos, right?\n\n36:44.840 --> 36:56.840\nWhat's your name? You can just call me Grass.\n\n36:56.840 --> 37:03.840\nOh, Grass, yeah. Yeah, you have a very pretty name. Can I say it? Grassiella.\n\n37:03.840 --> 37:10.840\nYeah, it's Graciella. You had me draw a thing on a piece of paper and you said you were\n\n37:10.840 --> 37:15.840\ngoing to go get it as a tattoo. So I did a heart and just... Dan Harmon, yeah.\n\n37:15.840 --> 37:21.840\nDan Harmon in the heart with an arrow going through it. And so that your boyfriend...\n\n37:21.840 --> 37:30.840\nEvery time you... Girlfriend. Girlfriend. How did I not allow for that? After all of my\n\n37:30.840 --> 37:35.840\nexperience as an LA, I'm coming out here and I'm just being a big heteronormative pig.\n\n37:35.840 --> 37:41.840\nJust bullying through your china shop. You're straight, right? You fucking straight person.\n\n37:41.840 --> 37:49.840\nI've learned nothing. 43. So you're in a relationship now, but my idea was that\n\n37:49.840 --> 37:55.840\nlater on, if you ever were... Not that this won't last forever. But that someone would be\n\n37:55.840 --> 37:59.840\nlike, who's Dan Harmon? I just thought it would be funny.\n\n37:59.840 --> 38:06.840\nYou might as well just have written laser here.\n\n38:06.840 --> 38:13.840\nOkay, Graciella. Can we ask you some questions just to know you?\n\n38:13.840 --> 38:17.840\nYeah, yeah, this is so surreal.

an insane person that hurts other people.\n\n01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.840\nJesus.\n\n01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.840\nI don't understand.\n\n01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.840\nI think...\n\n01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.840\nDo you need...\n\n01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.840\nDo you need...\n\n01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.840\nWould you know if you needed an actual doctor?\n\n01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.840\nDo

cerebral hematoma before.\n\n01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.840\nSo I know what a concussion\n\n01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.840\nand what blood\n\n01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.840\nwhat blood in your brain feels like.\n\n01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.840\nI mean, we should have hooked on to that guy.\n\n01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.840\nWelcome to my army, bitch!\n\n01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.840\nHa ha ha

assaulted?\n\n01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.840\nI think he was just trying to be funny.\n\n01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:15.840\nNo, you're not invited up here.\n\n01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.840\nPlease forgive us for not wanting you\n\n01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:19.840\nto run up on stage.\n\n01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.840\nI think that was somebody I knew.\n\n01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.840\nYes.\n\n01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.840\nYou know...\n\n01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.840\nThis wasn't a planned thing.\n\n01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.840\nI hope not.\n\n01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.840\nThat would be really a bad plan.\n\n01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.840\nYou can explain.\n\n01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.840\nI'm going to cater to his comfort right now.\n\n01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.840\nWait, really?\n\n01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.840\nDo you want to press charges?\n\n01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.840\nYou won't press charges?\n\n01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:45.840\nAnd this wasn't planned?\n\n01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.840\nNo!\n\n01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.840\nI don't think this was planned.\n\n01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.840\nIt's going to shine up.\n\n01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.840\nI mean, I've had my nose broken\n\n01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.840\nby a belligerent driver before.\n\n01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.840\nSo again, it's nothing I haven't been through.\n\n01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.840\nIt's cool.\n\n01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.840\nFlorida's great.\n\n01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.840\nThis is exactly what I expected Florida to be like.\n\n01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.840\nHa ha ha

have my permission to react in an excited way.\n\n01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.840\nI don't know how to put this together.\n\n01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.840\nSomeone else is going to get hurt.\n\n01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.840\nDon't devolve into a mob.\n\n01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.840\nI'm interested too.\n\n01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.840\nLet's talk about what just happened.\n\n01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.840\nHa ha ha ha!\n\n01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.840\nYeah, how do you know this guy?\n\n01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.840\nWell, I mean...\n\n01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.840\nI've actually known him for...\n\n01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.840\nOh, Jesus, here it comes.\n\n01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.840\nLike, six years?\n\n01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.840\nOkay.\n\n01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.840\nAnd I kind of think he...\n\n01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.840\nHe kind of gets himself\n\n01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.840\na little riled up\n\n01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.840\nand...\n\n01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.840\ninto situations.\n\n01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:57.840\nI think he was kind of...\n\n01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.840\n...\n\n01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.840\n...\n\n01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.840\n...\n\n01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.840\n...\n\n01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.840\nI'm kind of\n\n01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.840\nnot interested anymore.\n\n01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.840\nI don't think\n\n01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:13.840\nhis actions were justified, but...\n\n01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.840\nI thought they were.\n\n01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.840\nI thought he had a great...\n\n01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.840\n...\n\n01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.840\nHis point seemed very clear.\n\n01:14:21.840 -->

me,\n\n01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.840\nI'd be very shaken up.\n\n01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.840\nI'd not be able to carry on\n\n01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.840\nwith these comedic stylings like this.\n\n01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.840\nQuite honestly,\n\n01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.840\nthe only reason why I'm pressing on\n\n01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.840\nis only because it gets me more stage time.\n\n01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.840\nYeah.\n\n01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.840\nSo it was planned.\n\n01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.840\nNo, it wasn't planned at all.\n\n01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.840\nI'm actually really pissed off on him.\n\n01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.840\nI kind of don't want to give him a ride home right now.\n\n01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.840\nI feel like the cops\n\n01:14:53.840 -->

about anything you don't want to talk about,\n\n01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.840\nbut I'm just making the observation.\n\n01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.840\nI feel my face blowing up. I'm sorry.\n\n01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.840\nWhat's that?
