00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
The Miami, the home of the greatest splurged scene of the world!

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
The Miami, give me the fuck out of this city!

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
What the fuck is going on here?

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
It's Harvintown!

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
I guess I say who I am first, right?

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
I'm the ugly Jeff Davis!

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
And then who's next, Dan?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
No, or Spencer!

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
And the uh, Grand Dragon? What do you mean?

00:43.000 --> 00:55.000
Spencer Crittenden!

00:55.000 --> 01:08.000
And now, the mayor and chief of Harvintown, Dan Harvintown!

01:08.000 --> 01:16.000
Thank you Miami, thank you! Thank you!

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Okay, oh shit.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Thank you so much, that was a very warm welcome, you guys, it was very enthusiastic.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
Because you don't get to see me that often, right? How many people are from Florida?

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Uh, one person raised their hand.

01:32.000 --> 01:39.000
There's nothing wrong with that, I don't know why I'm pointing that out.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
There's no kids here, is there?

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Okay, good. I didn't know how this was built or what this is.

01:48.000 --> 01:56.000
My podcast is like, it's talking about my wiener and porn and whatever comes to mind.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Your wiener?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
My wiener usually comes to mind.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
Yeah, thank you so much for having us, we're here for those of you who are listening in

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
podcast form, we're here at, is it SuperCon?

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
No, it's Magic City.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
I'm so sorry.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
It's their seventh con this year, right?

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
I had one job, I could have learned the name of the fucking convention and I truly truly...

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
I didn't even know what Spencer was, so...

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
No, you nailed that. He's a grand-wizard.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Grand-wizard.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Are we going to play the KKK today?

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah, yeah. An exciting new special edition of Harmontown.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
That might be a discomfortingly feasible this far south, I don't know.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
It's going to be the only Harmontown I won't say nigger in.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Oh, Jesus.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
I said I won't.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Jesus.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Yeah, I'm moving on.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
We have different philosophies about the use of that word.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
I only use it while freestyling in my kitchen.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Or with pet names with women.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
It's true, I'll come clean about that stuff, but yeah.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
For me, it's not like it's an evil word.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I don't believe in hocus pocus, like words are bad and all that stuff.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I believe in social...

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
I put myself in the shoes of a person of color.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
I wouldn't want to be put in a position where people are always having to look to check with you.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Don't put that on me, that's why I know.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
I just hate black people.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
I wish I didn't because they're great.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
They're amazing people, but I can't open.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Maybe we'll have one up later and we'll try to get you through this.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I would love to learn.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
I'm always open to things. I'm open.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
I kind of thought this will be easy because these are my people.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
But I'm just realizing now I got nothing.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
Seriously, I really have nothing because where's my...

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
What did you say, sir?

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Sorry, can I say it again?

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Where's Ty?

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Ty, you're talking about Ty...

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Ty Brigston, the world's smallest show promoter.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
It's a little character that we did on the show once.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
I don't know if you ever talked about this, but remember when I was talking about giving a transvestite a blowjob?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Yes, I did talk about that.

04:50.000 --> 04:58.000
But I will say I listened to the recording and I did a bad job of relaying what the humor of it was.

04:58.000 --> 05:07.000
I was talking about blowing this and I didn't know if it was a guy or a girl.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
I said I don't want to be Archie Bunker here.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
Well, talking about making love to a transgender person.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Which is funny.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
And then you did a funny Archie Bunker imitation.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Geez, a meathead.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Yeah, I did it off of them too. They didn't like it.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
They're young and they're like, first of all, what is Archie Bunker?

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Second of all, you're transphobic.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Not to you, it's funny and ironic because you think you're not, but to us you are.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
And I'm like, well...

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm trying to perform for the kids.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah, no, they keep getting younger.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Or no, they stay the same age and we keep getting older.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
No, I don't, where's my notes?

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
We drove into, what do you call it, Miami.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Today, we wanted to listen to the Will Smith song.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
He made a whole...

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
He made a rapping song about Miami.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
He's a good rapper that Will Smith. I think he really...

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
He should have stuck with that. I don't know what happened.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
He's a talented person.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Yeah.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
I hear he's great.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
I don't like him.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
You guys may be too young to remember this, but he was on Barbara Walters once.

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
Like on the heels of Independence Day, it's like, Will Smith, taking over the world by storm.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
I'm sitting with him now.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
I think in the interview, she's like, so you have an interesting theory about AIDS.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
And he's like, oh, yeah, yeah.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
She's like, tell it to us.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
She's just like, stringing them out, stringing them along.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
And he's like, well, it's...

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
You know, you can't tell me that that disease was not created by the government.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
And she's like, really?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I think a lot of people can tell you that.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
But he just like, he went for it.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
He's one of the only people that I could think of.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Because like, Beck, his parents are Scientologists.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
And he's just being respectful.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Like, I'm sure you guys are big fans of...

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Judaism.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Judaism.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Everyone's like, who isn't a big fan?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Even if by proxy through, it's sequel.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
A Christianity.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
But...

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
No, who's the guy that we lost the Hugo Award to?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
He's the Josh Wheaton of sci-fi.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
So is Josh Wheaton.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Neil Gaiman.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Neil Gaiman is a...

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I really actually...

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Because I had heard he's a Scientologist.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
I was actually really touched by looking into it.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Yeah, well, he's not...

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
His parents are...

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
Listen, hold up. Just let him talk.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah, Dan, let him talk.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
His parents are, and he's respectful of the...

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
It's like the same way I'm Lutheran, which I am not.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
How do you be Lutheran or not?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Like, it's like I don't...

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
My parents are Lutheran.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I thought that was sweet.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
There's a lot of people like that.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
You're like, oh, he is? I respected that person.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
What do you mean they are?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
And I'm not...

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
By the way, if there's a Scientologist in here,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I'm sure you're already offended and there's nothing I can do about that.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
But I...

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
But I truthfully don't.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I mean, whatever.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I'm not going to explain that.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
To us, like the people that pay less for religion,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
like we find it funny and it's funny.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
To us, but we also recognize, I'm sure,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
because we're open-minded people that we shouldn't...

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
We don't want you to be different.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
We hope you're very happy.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
Anyways, Will Smith is the only famous Scientologist I know of

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
who I think is...

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
John Travolta was...

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Before he auditioned for Welcome Back Clodder,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
he was a Scientologist.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
There's a story about him being in an acting class

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
in the Celebrity Center or whatever

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
and going, I got this...

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I got an audition later today.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
It's for something called Welcome Back Clodder.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And the teacher being like,

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
everyone, I want you to point in the direction of Paramount Studios

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
where Jonathan has his audition today.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
And I want you to beam your UFO energies.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
I was at your show and I'm a Scientologist

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
and you called it UFO energy.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
You keep it a secret.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
So I don't know what it is.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Beam your xenons over to the Paramounts.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
And my point being that everybody's like,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
they're in it when they're younger

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
and their career takes off.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
But Will Smith is the one guy that was like,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
he woke up, he had all the money in the world,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
he had all the success.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
He was like, there's still something missing.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
He's like, oh, this is great.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
That's notable to me.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
But you, you, you...

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Spencer, you...

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Me.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Spencer picked...

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I hope this becomes a thing for him.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Spencer picked up on this thing that Will Smith does

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
in all his rap.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
This really confident, insincere laugh.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Will Smith always, in his raps,

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
he always sounds like he's jumping in through a French window

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
with a rose in his teeth.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Ha, ha.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And he has this, he has this rap,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
because we listened to the Miami song,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
and we're like, this is worse than I remember,

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
but...

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
And because Apple Music now just is sky-net

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
and just keeps playing.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
It started playing all these Will Smith songs,

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
and we heard this, this rap called, it's a freak,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I'm a freak, I'm gonna freak.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I'm gonna get freaky or...

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Freakin' it?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Freakin' it?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Freakin' it.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
He comes at the concept of freaking it.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
So many different angles.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
His refrain is just him over,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
he says a million different things about freaking it,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
like, like, like, like, he goes like,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
you all don't mind if I start freaking it?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
But, and he's like, I don't care,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I don't care what you want, I'm gonna freaking it.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
And then he's like,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
hey, who here wants me to start freaking it?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
He's like, what do you weigh?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Are you a populist or an elitist?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
I don't understand.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I was like, did you care who's listening?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Or did you, you're acting all like, like, like detached?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
But then, you know, it's like,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
he just keeps saying all these different things,

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
and you can't pin him down in a position,

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
and you don't even know what fre...

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
He never starts freaking it, as far as we know.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
He just, haha.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
But he, in this rap,

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
he alludes to the fact,

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
he goes like, yeah, and I, I, I...

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
He doesn't rap like that.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
He said a rap.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
It's Christian Bale in the big short.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
That's my, my, my, uh, camera.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
The, um, uh, he goes, uh,

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
I, I, I even, I even read in the paper

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
that somebody said I was soft.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Yeah.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Like, Microsoft.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Microsoft.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Which is, it's a soft rhyme,

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
and it's rhyming soft with soft,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
so it's not a compelling argument, either way.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
And he thinks Microsoft is hard.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Yeah.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
And...

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
A software company.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And Micro means small.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Like, if the company was mega soft.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Like, like, like, like, a little bit.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Like, you'd be like, okay, I guess he's like, kind of...

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Like, you think I'm flaccid.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I also have a little penis.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Yeah.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Yeah.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Flaccid.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
More like, more like,

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
uh, Lake Placid.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Haha.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Haha.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
Like, it's one of our most erect lakes.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Haha.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Anyone who uses the term freaky, by the way, is not freaky.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
You know, like, that song, Super Freak.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Yeah.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
You know how he describes freaky?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
She's a very sexy girl.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Incense wine and candles?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Haha.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
That's...

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
You don't know what freaky is.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
That's Playboy massage freaky.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Yeah.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
That's, uh, oh, yeah, yeah.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Hugh Hefner is selling the Playboy mansion.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Oh, right.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
I'm in it, though.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Yeah.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Did you guys hear about that?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
You can buy his...

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
You can buy the Playboy mansion for $200 million.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
There's a...

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
But you have to live with him.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
You're buying a nursing home that you have to work at.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Yeah, yeah.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
I want someone to...

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
I want, like, a millionaire to buy it and just put it in, like, a big glass dome.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Just like, this is...

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
This is Hugh Hefner.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
I want to know, like, once he...

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Like, if I had $200 million, I'd be like, what...

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Can I do anything I want with his corpse?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Like, after he dies?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Like, is it like...

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Is it like Sunset Boulevard?

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
Like, I said, did you move in and, like, he's just in one bedroom and, like, you bring up

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
soup and leave it outside the door?

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
Well, I think he can feed himself, but he gets the whole...

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
He gets the whole place.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Like, you can't say, you stay up here, I'll take the bottom floor.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
No, he's cruising into your bathroom and, like, he's doing all the stuff.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
And I think it also includes, like, some of his girlfriends, too.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
They're going to be living with you.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Which is kind of, you know, that's classic comedy.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
You guys read the description, there was the whistleblower young lady who described what

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
it...

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Finally, after, like, 60 years of, like, oh, Hugh Hefner, does he...

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Does he have sex with all those women?

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
And there's finally, like, there's this woman that just...

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
She just laid it out.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
She's, like, a typical knight in Hugh Hefner's house if you're one of these, like, playmates

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
that's allowed to live in a house.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
It sounded so fucking horrible.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Like, there was, like, a...

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
Because there's, like, a hierarchy, like, there's, like, a slightly...

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
The girl with seniority is kind of, like, indoctrinating the younger women.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
And it's, like, you just go in his room and he's watching porn and then you have to do

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
the stuff and...

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I mean, I'm all for the porn part.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
I just, like, the idea that, like...

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
I mean, what...

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Anyways, I was at the Playboy Mansion.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
It smells like mildew.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
It's a...

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Yeah, how much are they selling it for?

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Because whatever you're selling it for, you're going to have to pay that much just to clean

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
out the hot tub.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Right?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Yeah.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
It's disgusting.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
I already told them the podcast, the story.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I was at the Playboy Mansion for its 50th anniversary.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
The magazine's 15th anniversary.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
My encounter...

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
My and Rob Schrobb encountering David Hasselhoff.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
We...

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
We go...

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Now I'm going to tell it again.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
I haven't told you...

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
What number...

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
What number is it?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
I'll listen later.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
No, I don't know the story.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I just took that story.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
I don't care.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
I just love going through it because it's, like...

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
It was just so odd.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
I was just, like...

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
We got, like...

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
There's David Hasselhoff.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
I...

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
I think it's okay to say that.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
The...

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
I mean, for me it is.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
I don't know.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
It's Rob.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Rob gets high and he's directing Lego Town.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
You're high on incest.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
The...

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
But we were, like...

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
And we were, like...

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Oh, my God.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
David Hasselhoff.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
And I was, like...

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Yeah, but let's not bug him.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
And Rob's, like...

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
It's the Playboy Mansion.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Everyone's bugged by each other.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Like, it's, like...

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
It's, like, corniest place.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
And, like, we'll always wonder what would happen.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Let's go...

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
We got to talk to Knight Rider.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
And, like...

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
And we go up to him and we...

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
And then he's, like, nine feet tall.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
And we go, like...

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
We go, like, hey, we made a pilot.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
It was based on you.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
That's what Rob said.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
He's talking about Heat Vision and Jack.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
And, uh...

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Which had a talking motorcycle on it.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
It was very much...

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
It was inspired by Knight Rider.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
And...

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
And Hasselhoff goes, like...

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
What?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Really?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Uh...

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
It was inspired by Knight Rider.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
So it's, like...

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
It's, like...

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
It's a valentine to you.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
And he's, like...

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Who directed that?

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
And we go, Ben Stiller.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
And he goes, like...

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Oh, what else did he do?

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
And Rob goes, Zoolander.

16:28.000 --> 16:35.000
And David Hasselhoff goes, Zoolander's based on me?

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
And I swear to God, I would be the first to self-deprecate.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
But I'm not exaggerating this.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
There was a three-second pause and Rob and I in unison went, yes.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
I walked away.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
Because we had gotten everything we would get.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
But I said, I picture him going home and watching Zoolander.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Calling his lawyer.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
It is.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Have you seen this?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
And he's, like...

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
I don't know what you're talking about, David.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
No, it's clear.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Once you point it out, it's obvious.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
He's telling that story on his podcast in Germany or whatever.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
I'm in Zoolander!

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
I had to make a tinkle before I came on stage and Dustin Marshall,

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
our producer here from Ferrell Audio, he...

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
He chickened upon himself.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
We won't go to find the bathroom together.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
We had to walk through a lot of stuff.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
It was a long way.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
There were a couple of elevator rides.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
It's a long journey to find the bathroom.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
There's a bathroom right through that wall.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Like right there.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Yeah, but there's no door.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
We eventually found it.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
We walked in and there was just like...

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
There was just like four urinals along the wall.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
Dustin was like, whoa, it's like P city in here.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
It's like we had found the National Treasure vault.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
It's a P city.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
That reminds me, I walked into the bathroom once and there was a janitor.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
He's like, ah, fuck!

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
I said, what's the matter?

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
He's like, it smells like shit and piss in here.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
You're a janitor in a toilet.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:14.000 --> 18:20.000
People who are shocked at their job time, we had this weird flight delay today.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
We got an airplane at LAX and I'm going to round the numbers off here.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
I don't know the exact ones, but it's like basically four hours from Miami.

18:30.000 --> 18:38.000
But we were in the air and I guess I was asleep and so was the guy next to me.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
Oh, so first of all, sorry, let me start at the beginning,

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
because I had a terrible day today.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
First class American Airlines, the worst.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Sorry.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
No, no, no, I'm not going to complain more about airlines.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
These things happened on a plane.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I'm the bad guy in most of it.

18:57.000 --> 19:06.000
I get on the plane and I'm like, my ticket says 5B.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
And I look and it says aisle.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
And there's a guy that's kind of like, he's got, I see on his ticket,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
oh, I'm sorry, it says 5B on his ticket.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Why is that important?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Because someone's going to fact check it and go, if you were in 5B,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
you weren't in the aisle.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
I won't blame you.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
I have the same neurological disorder.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
You do.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
I just don't.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
He's talking to himself, folks.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
But he's like, I can see on his ticket that it says 5B,

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
so I know he's sitting in that aisle and I'm 5A.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
But he's like, he's talking to some lady that's like a row ahead.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
And he, but he's going like, oh, I don't, I don't know.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I'm in the window or whatever.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
And I'm like thinking in my head, I don't care if you don't like the window.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
You're not going to pull one of these things.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Like I'm just thinking that in my head.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
And he's like, I don't know.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
It says I'm 5A, but I said it's the window.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
I pointed at the diagram.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
I said there's a drawing of a guy in a window next to his head.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
And there's no confusion lately.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
And then he starts sitting down.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
But then it turns out the lady in the row ahead, she's like,

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
it becomes clear that they're a couple and they're traveling together.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
And she's like, I don't know why they would sit me up here.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
And I said, oh, do you want to switch seats?

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
And she's like, you would do that for us?

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
I said, well, of course.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
I mean, you know, like what, what, what, yeah, you guys sit there.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
And she's like, which, thank you, thank you very much.

20:32.000 --> 20:40.000
I've not since 9-11 has the bravery been acknowledged.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
It's God, it's God said that I was starting to get a little pissed off

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
that people didn't applaud.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
Thank you for, for, you know, it's like they're selfish people.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
They don't, they don't know heroism when they hear about it.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Because that was the end of my story.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
Because they didn't applaud, I was going to start making shit up

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
because I was embarrassed for you.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
No, I go, I'll switch seats with you.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
And I, but I specifically said, I said, so this is your seat, right?

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
And I point at 4B, which is the window.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
I'm sorry, I keep switching these letters around, but it's at 4B.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
And she said, yes, that's my seat.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
And I go, okay, because obviously I wouldn't want to, you know,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
screw with whoever else is sitting or whatever.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
But it's like, oh, thank you so much.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
So she sits there in 5A next to her husband in 5B.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
And I go into 4B.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
And there's like cookie packages and shit.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I just start like throwing shit around.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
I've got, you know, it's my home now.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
I installed a ceiling fan.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
If I could, there's a pillow.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I drew a face on it and fucked it.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
Like I threw it out the window of the plane and like, like, like,

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
like rubbed my butt all over the seat to make it nice and warm.

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
And then this couple comes out and they look at me and they're just like,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
like, they have this look on their face.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Like, what is this homeless Kevin Smith?

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
Like, and they're like, and I'm like, and I know the look.

22:10.000 --> 22:16.000
And so I turn to the woman behind me and I go, did you give me someone else's seat?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Really accusing.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
I did not rise above it at all.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
And she was like, oh, I'm sorry.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Well, I don't, she holds up her ticket.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
It says 3B.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
What are you, how are you?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
If you had a whole conversation, yes.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Thank you.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
I think you're applauding maybe her, but...

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
I think that person has an OCD thing.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
I don't think they're applauding for you.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
They're flapping as I was talking about.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
You're stimming, you're stimming.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
There was no connection to anything good.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Sorry, what's that?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Tourette's.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Tourette's, yes.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Okay, I'm sorry.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
I asked what you said.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Maybe it's possible in a strange way.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
You have Tourette's.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Sounds like you have Tourette's.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
He has meta Tourette's.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
He just shouts the word Tourette's out.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
He has Tourette's.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
He has Tourette's.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
He has Tourette's.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
Okay, Dan, I was at your show.

23:16.000 --> 23:23.000
I'm a Scientologist with Tourette's, and I consider this my letter of resignation from

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
your fandom.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
You are really offending a lot of people tonight.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
I get it, I get it.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
So I have to go all the way up to 3B.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
The guy in 3A, this is so late in the stage.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
He's thinking like, oh, shit, man, I got an empty seat next to me.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
He's got socks and laundry and fucking backpacks and pretzels.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
And I feel bad for him.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
I feel bad for myself.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
It's just a clusterfuck.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
And I sit down next to him.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
That's the end of that chapter of the story, but it continues.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
It gets so fascinating.

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
So me and this gentleman, we fall asleep together, like next to each other on the plane.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
At some point.

24:10.000 --> 24:17.000
So at some point during the flight, like, we missed them saying, ladies and gentlemen,

24:17.000 --> 24:23.000
it's so foggy in Miami that we're landing in Orlando.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.440
We both missed that announcement and just woke up at some point, and we're descending

24:28.440 --> 24:35.000
on this city, and he's looking out the window, and he starts going, he goes, that's not Miami.

24:35.000 --> 24:45.000
And I'm like, oh, yeah?

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
Check, please.

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
And I was like, what do you mean?

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
And he's like, I'm serious.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
That's not Miami.

24:59.000 --> 25:06.000
And I swear to God, I'm so embarrassed, obviously this ends with my comeuppance, but I was

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
like so, I was riding this high.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I was like, it's so patronizing to him.

25:10.000 --> 25:18.000
I was like, I think, you know, you get in a metal tube, and it goes like this for a while.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
And I think it always ends up in the city you bought the ticket to.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
It's my experience with air travel.

25:25.000 --> 25:33.000
And he's like, I'm from Miami, that is not Miami.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
I said, it's a bunch of glowing lights.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
It's a grid of roofs.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
I mean, maybe you have city blindness.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
To me, it looks like it could be Miami, it could be Copenhagen.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
I don't judge by this distance.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
Like you said, you wouldn't know LA.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
I'm like, guys kind of chuckling, because I want to make it clear.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
I'm really busting the guy's balls.

26:05.000 --> 26:12.000
And I'm like, let's you and I, we'll land the plane, we'll get out very carefully, we'll

26:12.000 --> 26:19.000
peek out, we'll find a newspaper.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
And he's not laughing anymore, because he's like, I'm serious.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
I'm from Miami.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
That's not Miami.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
I'm like, okay, okay, okay.

26:27.000 --> 26:33.000
So then the crazy thing is, because they already told everybody, but we were asleep, they

26:33.000 --> 26:41.000
don't then say, okay, like the plane lands in this city, and they still haven't said,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
they said it before, so they don't say it again.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
They just like land, and then they're like, okay, just hold on.

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
We'll get everybody where they're going as soon as the problem's over.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
What's happening?

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
After 20 minutes, a guy walks up with his luggage to the front of the plane, and he's

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
like, I'm getting out.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I want to get out of the plane.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
You can't get out of the plane.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
You can't.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
If you get out of the plane, you're in the wrong place.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
I'm like, what the hell, are we on the tar?

27:12.000 --> 27:20.000
I see the tube is connected, the thingy, and he's like, I have a right to get off the plane.

27:20.000 --> 27:28.000
I will get a cab, and she's like, okay, but you have to just hold on a second, and she

27:28.000 --> 27:32.520
gets on the thing, and she goes, ladies and gentlemen, there are people that are wanting

27:32.520 --> 27:39.000
to get off the plane, and it's their right to do so, but it's not a good idea if you

27:39.000 --> 27:41.840
do get off the plane, and I don't recommend it.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.840
Don't go far.

27:43.840 --> 27:47.840
I'm like, what the fuck is happening?

27:47.840 --> 27:50.840
Is this like Langoliers?

27:50.840 --> 27:53.840
Don't go far.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.840
Did a terrorist attack happen?

27:55.840 --> 27:57.840
Don't go far.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.840
It's Earth.

27:58.840 --> 27:59.840
What do you mean, don't go far?

27:59.840 --> 28:01.840
What if I have family?

28:01.840 --> 28:04.840
We're in Miami, aren't we?

28:04.840 --> 28:10.840
And then I was like, finally, they never said the word Orlando, and then, oh, so that guy,

28:10.840 --> 28:15.840
so she finishes shaming that guy, and then she's like, she goes, I reckon we're going

28:15.840 --> 28:18.840
to turn out the lights, and everybody should take a nap.

28:18.840 --> 28:21.840
That's what she said.

28:21.840 --> 28:30.840
It's like a Jonestown thing is happening, and then I said, then 28 seconds after that,

28:30.840 --> 28:36.840
based on some visual cue, I don't know if some guy out the window was like, made like

28:36.840 --> 28:38.840
a base stealing gesture or something.

28:38.840 --> 28:40.840
She gets back in the fight.

28:40.840 --> 28:43.840
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, everybody get off the plane and don't go far.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.840
She's like, why are you still on the plane?

28:45.840 --> 28:46.840
Get off the plane.

28:46.840 --> 28:49.840
She started yelling at us for being on the plane.

28:49.840 --> 28:50.840
Why are you napping?

28:50.840 --> 28:51.840
Get off.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.840
But don't go far.

28:53.840 --> 29:00.840
And I got up and I put on my backpack, and I said, I don't think this is Miami.

29:00.840 --> 29:05.840
And the guy's like, I know.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.840
And we went out and it was Orlando.

29:07.840 --> 29:11.840
And I bought a bunch of salmon stuff.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.840
Yeah, thank you.

29:13.840 --> 29:14.840
Thanks, guys.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.840
That's when you applaud.

29:16.840 --> 29:17.840
Yeah.

29:17.840 --> 29:23.840
But there was a lady, we went to a sandwich restaurant, and the woman at the sandwich

29:23.840 --> 29:27.840
restaurant was confused and frustrated.

29:27.840 --> 29:34.840
She couldn't believe when she got up that morning to work at her airport sandwich store.

29:34.840 --> 29:43.840
But she's like, what she was saying was, next, what do you, what, what, what?

29:43.840 --> 29:45.840
I'll have, can I have a breakfast sandwich?

29:45.840 --> 29:47.840
We have ham and cheese and sausage eggs.

29:47.840 --> 29:50.840
I said, I'll have ham, egg and bacon.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.840
We have ham and cheese.

29:52.840 --> 29:53.840
We have bacon.

29:53.840 --> 29:54.840
I fucked up.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.840
I was like, I'll have that one.

29:56.840 --> 30:03.840
And she's like, the unspoken part of her statement was like, how can this be happening to me?

30:03.840 --> 30:09.840
How can a plane land next to my sandwich counter?

30:09.840 --> 30:14.840
And all of these hungry people are just lining up and wanting sandwiches.

30:14.840 --> 30:19.840
I come here to read.

30:19.840 --> 30:21.840
And I stole a bag of Doritos.

30:21.840 --> 30:22.840
Yeah.

30:22.840 --> 30:28.840
I knew you guys would get that.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.840
In LA, they'd boo that.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.840
Fucking, Miami style.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.840
Miami style.

30:34.840 --> 30:40.840
This place invented vice.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.840
And then I fucked a baby.

30:42.840 --> 30:50.840
And then I fed it to, do you have crocodiles or alligators?

30:50.840 --> 30:51.840
Yeah.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.840
You know what, it was an alligator.

30:53.840 --> 30:56.840
But I sharpened its nose and turned it into a crocodile.

30:56.840 --> 30:57.840
I don't give a shit.

30:57.840 --> 31:11.840
I stole a bag of Doritos. I grabbed it, I opened it and just started eating it. I went up to

31:11.840 --> 31:18.840
the counter. I waited for her to charge me for it. I was like, I'll have a sandwich. I was like,

31:18.840 --> 31:26.840
I'm stealing Doritos and I stole it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, whatever you guys are saying.

31:26.840 --> 31:36.840
Turrets! All right, Will Smith, that shit. There was one other thing I swear to God.

31:36.840 --> 31:47.840
Thanks, Steve. That's Steve. Steve once. He drives down. Steve rented a car and we, well,

31:47.840 --> 31:51.840
that's the weird thing. There's nothing funny about this, but I just find it incredibly ironic

31:51.840 --> 31:58.840
that we got, it's a four hour flight from LA to Miami and we were then four hours from Miami

31:58.840 --> 32:09.840
by car. So had we stayed home until the fog lifted, we could have just, oh, are you guys okay?

32:09.840 --> 32:16.840
Oh, did Sherlock Holmes come out? Is Jack the Ripper here? How could you hear each other

32:16.840 --> 32:24.840
over the fog horns? It must have been so foggy. I don't know why. If it's too foggy for the

32:24.840 --> 32:28.840
land, I don't know why it wasn't a big deal. Yeah, other planes landed in that timeframe,

32:28.840 --> 32:35.840
I think. He saw it. I will say, though, that's the one thing I won't complain about, though,

32:35.840 --> 32:40.840
as far as like an airline. If they're scared to land, even if it means because they think

32:40.840 --> 32:48.840
they suck, like, I can't do fog, man. I can't do it. I'm like, don't do it, Steven. This

32:48.840 --> 32:55.840
isn't time to, I don't want to be part of your fucking coming of age story. Just land in Orlando

32:55.840 --> 33:04.840
and go back to flight school and just avoid London. Yeah, I want that guy in flight that

33:04.840 --> 33:11.840
turned the plane upside down on cocaine. Yeah, who was that guy? Yes, it was Denzel Washington.

33:11.840 --> 33:18.840
We like that flight movie. No, there was something else. God damn it. There was something

33:18.840 --> 33:28.840
else. Shit. Fuck. I mean, it was a doozy. Turrets. Dinosaur? Did you just say dinosaur?

33:28.840 --> 33:38.840
What did you say? Oh, yeah, you forgot how we stopped at that amusement park. I got chased

33:38.840 --> 33:46.840
by dinosaurs. No, I did not forget. It was a real keeper. I texted you guys, I was wondering

33:46.840 --> 33:50.840
where you were, and Steve texted me the name of the place, and I thought he was joking.

33:50.840 --> 33:58.840
What was the name of that place? Yeehaw. I'm like, come on, come on, Steve. I want to

33:58.840 --> 34:07.840
know where you guys are. Yeehaw. Yeah, we were in Yeehaw. It was great. It had like a truck

34:07.840 --> 34:13.840
stop slash crunchy crispy chicken. What was that place called? It's a great combination

34:13.840 --> 34:19.840
of businesses. I'll tell you that. Can I get a Will Smith insincere confident laugh?

34:19.840 --> 34:30.840
It was a great set of businesses. Ha ha ha ha. You know, he really committed to wrapping

34:30.840 --> 34:34.840
clean, especially in that freaking it. I don't know if you guys know this, but freaking it

34:34.840 --> 34:41.840
is a euphemism for fucking it. But he specifies like, I dare you to make a verse without a

34:41.840 --> 34:51.840
curse. Like me, I'm Microsoft. Ha ha ha ha. Or like whatever. Yeah, he was pre-rape

34:51.840 --> 35:00.840
Cosby-ing the listener. Before he was that kind of monster, we have now forgotten that

35:00.840 --> 35:08.840
Cosby was a fan of high-roading. Yeah, he was a famous high-roader when it came to language.

35:08.840 --> 35:14.840
Oh, yeah, and also pants pulling up, right? Yeah, no, he didn't like any of that nonsense.

35:14.840 --> 35:23.840
It's not sophisticated. He liked pulling pants down, right? Yes, he did. Ha ha ha ha.

35:23.840 --> 35:36.840
Any Cosby's here? Because you guys seem a little offended by the idea of berating that

35:36.840 --> 35:46.840
guy for victimizing people. Ha ha ha ha. Be fair to him. All right. Yeah, someone said

35:46.840 --> 35:52.840
Cosplay is a joke. It's a funny joke. What if you're Cosplaying Cosby? What is that?

35:52.840 --> 35:59.840
It's Bill Cosplay. That's far too much credit. I was just filling in while you were looking

35:59.840 --> 36:03.840
at your notes. I don't know why I keep pulling out because I clearly lost my notes, but I

36:03.840 --> 36:10.840
keep pulling out the phone like it's like a life preserver. Let's get a...

36:10.840 --> 36:14.840
We should get a rick. We don't have a lot of... There's a lot of ricks in the audience.

36:14.840 --> 36:18.840
Oh, yeah? Well, yeah, there's ricks. Lots of ricks. Let's do a rick parade.

36:18.840 --> 36:25.840
I did a signing today. There's a gazurpazurp field. Do you want to come up and show your

36:25.840 --> 36:34.840
gazurpazurpazurp? Are you shy? You can be shy if you want. It's your right. Stand, get

36:34.840 --> 36:44.840
up on the stage. Get her some darn enchiladas. You're the girl with the weird tattoos, right?

36:44.840 --> 36:56.840
What's your name? You can just call me Grass.

36:56.840 --> 37:03.840
Oh, Grass, yeah. Yeah, you have a very pretty name. Can I say it? Grassiella.

37:03.840 --> 37:10.840
Yeah, it's Graciella. You had me draw a thing on a piece of paper and you said you were

37:10.840 --> 37:15.840
going to go get it as a tattoo. So I did a heart and just... Dan Harmon, yeah.

37:15.840 --> 37:21.840
Dan Harmon in the heart with an arrow going through it. And so that your boyfriend...

37:21.840 --> 37:30.840
Every time you... Girlfriend. Girlfriend. How did I not allow for that? After all of my

37:30.840 --> 37:35.840
experience as an LA, I'm coming out here and I'm just being a big heteronormative pig.

37:35.840 --> 37:41.840
Just bullying through your china shop. You're straight, right? You fucking straight person.

37:41.840 --> 37:49.840
I've learned nothing. 43. So you're in a relationship now, but my idea was that

37:49.840 --> 37:55.840
later on, if you ever were... Not that this won't last forever. But that someone would be

37:55.840 --> 37:59.840
like, who's Dan Harmon? I just thought it would be funny.

37:59.840 --> 38:06.840
You might as well just have written laser here.

38:06.840 --> 38:13.840
Okay, Graciella. Can we ask you some questions just to know you?

38:13.840 --> 38:17.840
Yeah, yeah, this is so surreal. What are some of your weird tattoos?

38:17.840 --> 38:20.840
All right, so I have a little pretzel behind my ear.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.840
She's got a little pretzel behind her ear.

38:22.840 --> 38:27.840
And I also have a little fish here because it's only like $13.

38:27.840 --> 38:31.840
And both of those are lesbian code, right?

38:31.840 --> 38:33.840
A little bit, yeah.

38:33.840 --> 38:40.840
Pretzel behind the ear.

38:40.840 --> 38:45.840
Message received.

38:45.840 --> 38:51.840
Fish ankle, eh? I read you loud and clear.

38:51.840 --> 38:55.840
What do you do for a living?

38:55.840 --> 38:57.840
I sell health insurance.

38:57.840 --> 39:00.840
Aw, you're so sad about it. You want to be an astronaut?

39:00.840 --> 39:03.840
That's a joke with all my friends because they always talk about my job,

39:03.840 --> 39:06.840
because I work like 13 hours a day sometimes.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.840
Is it fulfilling?

39:08.840 --> 39:10.840
I get a lot of money.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.840
Yeah.

39:12.840 --> 39:15.840
Do you think you're kind of a workaholic?

39:15.840 --> 39:17.840
No, because I really don't like working.

39:17.840 --> 39:21.840
Well, I don't either, but I kind of like define myself by my work.

39:21.840 --> 39:25.840
But you're just doing it for the money. You're trying to build up a nest egg

39:25.840 --> 39:30.840
and you get a little retirement plan going at the age of 11 or whatever you are.

39:30.840 --> 39:37.840
Are you working hard because do you have an extravagant lifestyle?

39:37.840 --> 39:44.840
And you're like, I want more money, so I can go to the pretzel ear strip club.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.840
I just smoke a lot of weed, that's for me.

39:47.840 --> 39:53.840
How are the police here about weed?

39:53.840 --> 39:55.840
Like if you get pulled over and there's a...

39:55.840 --> 39:57.840
I think it's just...

39:57.840 --> 40:02.840
I've just been really paranoid, so I haven't been interacting with police much.

40:02.840 --> 40:05.840
I forgot to ask you, are you from here in Florida?

40:05.840 --> 40:07.840
Yeah, Fort Lauderdale.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.840
Is that where they keep all the gold?

40:10.840 --> 40:12.840
I have no idea.

40:12.840 --> 40:14.840
I've never seen gold.

40:14.840 --> 40:18.840
Fort Ramfort.

40:18.840 --> 40:20.840
I have more questions.

40:20.840 --> 40:24.840
Can you use health insurance to remove tattoos?

40:24.840 --> 40:26.840
No, because it's an elective surgery.

40:26.840 --> 40:29.840
Okay.

40:29.840 --> 40:32.840
Where are you going to get the tattoo? They want to know.

40:32.840 --> 40:38.840
No, they mean like on third and...

40:38.840 --> 40:43.840
You're going to get a heart with my name on it on this side of your thigh?

40:43.840 --> 40:45.840
Oh, I thought you said thyroid.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.840
That's a weird place.

40:47.840 --> 40:49.840
Don't tattoo your thyroid.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.840
Your eyes will bug out.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.840
You'll never be able to drink coffee.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.840
I'm just basing that on my mom.

40:56.840 --> 40:59.840
She has a thyroid, she has Graves Disorder.

40:59.840 --> 41:02.840
You don't care, you didn't say thyroid.

41:02.840 --> 41:04.840
Just tell me.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.840
Alright, health insurance.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.840
You seem young enough, I can ask how old you are, right?

41:08.840 --> 41:10.840
I just turned 20 in November.

41:10.840 --> 41:12.840
Oh, you're a little baby.

41:12.840 --> 41:17.840
Look at the baby arms on red.

41:17.840 --> 41:20.840
You're not even allowed to drink technically.

41:20.840 --> 41:22.840
That's why you're such a stoner.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.840
Yeah, honestly.

41:24.840 --> 41:28.840
Who else is that young in here?

41:28.840 --> 41:30.840
That's cool.

41:30.840 --> 41:32.840
Wait, it's cool because...

41:32.840 --> 41:34.840
I expected more.

41:34.840 --> 41:37.840
I think that's really interesting how mature our audience is.

41:37.840 --> 41:42.840
Ha ha.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.840
Who's the oldest here? I bet I am.

41:44.840 --> 41:47.840
Who thinks they're the oldest person in this audience?

41:47.840 --> 41:49.840
This guy's standing up.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.840
How old are you?

41:51.840 --> 41:53.840
Yeah.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.840
Uh-oh.

41:55.840 --> 41:57.840
How old are you?

41:57.840 --> 41:59.840
Oh, shit, 53?

41:59.840 --> 42:01.840
Who can be 53?

42:01.840 --> 42:03.840
Wait, who's 53? This guy.

42:03.840 --> 42:05.840
Ah, fuck.

42:05.840 --> 42:07.840
Fuckin' grandpa.

42:07.840 --> 42:09.840
Go fuck yourself.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.840
Go fuck your grandma.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.840
Time for bed, old man.

42:13.840 --> 42:17.840
Do you have any desire to come up here and introduce yourself

42:17.840 --> 42:19.840
and let us ask old people questions?

42:19.840 --> 42:21.840
Yeah, I want to know because...

42:23.840 --> 42:25.840
Gracie, do you...

42:25.840 --> 42:27.840
Let's have a hand for Gracie.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.840
We'll start.

42:29.840 --> 42:33.840
This is a fucking nightmare because he looks younger than me.

42:33.840 --> 42:35.840
Oh, he does...

42:35.840 --> 42:37.840
Yeah, he does like handsome for things that are just listening.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.840
I didn't say handsomer.

42:39.840 --> 42:41.840
Oh, here.

42:41.840 --> 42:43.840
Why don't you have a seat?

42:43.840 --> 42:45.840
When did the pain start?

42:45.840 --> 42:47.840
For me, it literally was my birthday.

42:47.840 --> 42:51.840
Like, I couldn't walk more than like three blocks.

42:51.840 --> 42:53.840
And now my arm, my shoulder...

42:53.840 --> 42:55.840
Yeah, you get those pains right down your side.

42:55.840 --> 42:57.840
Oh, it's terrible.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.840
And do they ever get better? You're my future.

42:59.840 --> 43:01.840
Your hair gets longer.

43:01.840 --> 43:05.840
Yeah, I can't wait until my hair gets grayer, I gotta say,

43:05.840 --> 43:07.840
because I got this, it looks like a toupee up here.

43:07.840 --> 43:11.840
So what does an old bastard like yourself get out of a

43:11.840 --> 43:15.840
Young Whipper Snappers podcast like this?

43:15.840 --> 43:17.840
It just reminds me of my youth.

43:17.840 --> 43:21.840
Back in the glory days of being 43 and...

43:21.840 --> 43:23.840
Exactly.

43:23.840 --> 43:25.840
I only have sciatica.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.840
It's like driving with the top down, baby.

43:27.840 --> 43:29.840
When did you get a kidney stone?

43:29.840 --> 43:31.840
Kid... Oh, no.

43:31.840 --> 43:33.840
Okay, let's talk about the kidney stone.

43:33.840 --> 43:35.840
Wait, you had one? How old were you?

43:35.840 --> 43:37.840
I had one, my first one was 16.

43:37.840 --> 43:39.840
Oh, I'm way past that.

43:39.840 --> 43:41.840
Did you just drink a lot of milk?

43:41.840 --> 43:43.840
What is it that you don't drink enough water?

43:43.840 --> 43:45.840
It's calcium.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.840
But I stopped drinking milk, but I still got them.

43:47.840 --> 43:49.840
I feel like I'm just...

43:49.840 --> 43:51.840
I'm gonna have...

43:51.840 --> 43:53.840
One day I'm gonna go, oh, that was a kidney stone

43:53.840 --> 43:55.840
and I'm never gonna stop having them because I never drink water.

43:55.840 --> 43:57.840
I think vodka kills kidney stones.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.840
Oh, that's good, good to know.

43:59.840 --> 44:01.840
I'm no doctor.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.840
I feel like the inside of my kidneys

44:03.840 --> 44:05.840
is just like this like crazy like Narnia,

44:05.840 --> 44:07.840
like winter wonderland

44:07.840 --> 44:09.840
of like white stalagmites and stalagmites.

44:09.840 --> 44:11.840
Dark issue.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.840
Just waiting to like for the first one to crumble.

44:13.840 --> 44:15.840
And so like...

44:15.840 --> 44:17.840
But we'll get Percocet when we get the kidney stones.

44:17.840 --> 44:19.840
Just walk us through my worst nightmare.

44:19.840 --> 44:21.840
Well, my worst...

44:21.840 --> 44:23.840
I have lots of bad nightmares,

44:23.840 --> 44:25.840
but this is one of my...

44:25.840 --> 44:27.840
This is like because it's just so definite

44:27.840 --> 44:29.840
that it's gonna happen and it's like...

44:29.840 --> 44:31.840
I don't want to hear it.

44:31.840 --> 44:33.840
Like what is the first thing that happens?

44:33.840 --> 44:35.840
Is it like a pain in your side or...

44:35.840 --> 44:37.840
You start sweating on your upper lip.

44:37.840 --> 44:39.840
You look like Richard Nixon.

44:39.840 --> 44:41.840
And you start sweating like a dog.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.840
That's the worst part.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.840
I do.

44:45.840 --> 44:47.840
Fuckin' Richard Nixon.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.840
Not one of our better looking presidents.

44:49.840 --> 44:51.840
That's interesting.

44:51.840 --> 44:53.840
Okay, I have never heard that.

44:53.840 --> 44:55.840
Jesus, here it comes.

44:55.840 --> 44:57.840
Right down into your balls.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.840
It's just like somebody's squeezing men of ice.

44:59.840 --> 45:01.840
Hey, this doesn't sound too bad.

45:01.840 --> 45:03.840
Yeah.

45:03.840 --> 45:05.840
You pay somebody extra.

45:05.840 --> 45:07.840
Yeah.

45:07.840 --> 45:09.840
You really wish somebody would just hit you in the side

45:09.840 --> 45:11.840
with a baseball bat to get the pain to go away.

45:11.840 --> 45:13.840
But that would hurt more.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.840
No, it doesn't.

45:15.840 --> 45:17.840
Can you just take the drugs and write it out?

45:17.840 --> 45:19.840
No.

45:19.840 --> 45:21.840
There's two kinds of pain with it.

45:21.840 --> 45:23.840
The cutting, which is the little tiny bone

45:23.840 --> 45:25.840
cutting through your body.

45:25.840 --> 45:27.840
Oh.

45:27.840 --> 45:29.840
And then when it can't move anymore, the urine backs up

45:29.840 --> 45:31.840
and then that pain hurts like a mother fuck.

45:31.840 --> 45:33.840
You cannot believe it.

45:33.840 --> 45:35.840
And you can't get comfortable.

45:35.840 --> 45:37.840
There's no place to, like, get comfortable at all.

45:37.840 --> 45:39.840
Oh.

45:39.840 --> 45:41.840
Yeah, that's exactly...

45:41.840 --> 45:43.840
Yes, I wanted to...

45:43.840 --> 45:45.840
Yeah, apple cider.

45:45.840 --> 45:47.840
Do you need some of the glass?

45:47.840 --> 45:49.840
Yeah, I mean, sure.

45:49.840 --> 45:51.840
I understand.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.840
Even me? I would love to go.

45:53.840 --> 45:55.840
Thank you. I asked you to share it.

45:55.840 --> 45:57.840
I wanted to confront it.

45:57.840 --> 45:59.840
I have a morbid fascination.

45:59.840 --> 46:01.840
I have people up all the time that have, like, different...

46:01.840 --> 46:03.840
Oh, there was a kid. Hey, is that kid here today

46:03.840 --> 46:05.840
at the show?

46:05.840 --> 46:07.840
The kid with the tracheotomy?

46:07.840 --> 46:09.840
Are you in the audience? No.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.840
He wasn't a fan. Okay.

46:11.840 --> 46:13.840
There was a kid that came to the Rick and Morty signing

46:13.840 --> 46:15.840
and he had a hole

46:15.840 --> 46:17.840
in his...

46:17.840 --> 46:19.840
It was a tracheotomy and he had, like,

46:19.840 --> 46:21.840
a little plastic plug in it.

46:21.840 --> 46:23.840
And I was like, what's going on?

46:23.840 --> 46:25.840
What happened? And I can't remember now

46:25.840 --> 46:27.840
the name of the disorder, but he had it when he was...

46:27.840 --> 46:29.840
He said...

46:29.840 --> 46:31.840
I stopped breathing in my sleep,

46:31.840 --> 46:33.840
like sleep apnea, but, like, way worse.

46:33.840 --> 46:35.840
And I said...

46:35.840 --> 46:37.840
How...

46:37.840 --> 46:39.840
How long have you had it?

46:39.840 --> 46:41.840
He said, since I was three months old...

46:41.840 --> 46:43.840
Wow.

46:43.840 --> 46:45.840
How do you survive as a baby?

46:45.840 --> 46:47.840
If...

46:47.840 --> 46:49.840
He must be the luckiest guy in the world.

46:49.840 --> 46:51.840
Like, how many three-month-old kids

46:51.840 --> 46:53.840
like...

46:53.840 --> 46:55.840
He has to have been a first child,

46:55.840 --> 46:57.840
because when you have your first kid,

46:57.840 --> 46:59.840
you're all... His eyes are moving.

46:59.840 --> 47:01.840
No, that's good.

47:01.840 --> 47:03.840
It means a word.

47:03.840 --> 47:05.840
Like, wow, what a...

47:05.840 --> 47:07.840
What a lucky son of a bitch

47:07.840 --> 47:09.840
that fucking whole throat was.

47:09.840 --> 47:11.840
He is here.

47:11.840 --> 47:13.840
He's just afraid to talk.

47:13.840 --> 47:15.840
But, yeah, he was...

47:15.840 --> 47:17.840
He was... I don't know.

47:17.840 --> 47:19.840
I have a fascination with this stuff,

47:19.840 --> 47:21.840
because I feel like such a...

47:21.840 --> 47:23.840
I feel like if I get sick, if anything bad happens

47:23.840 --> 47:25.840
to me, I feel like I've been so lucky,

47:25.840 --> 47:27.840
and I don't have any faith in myself

47:27.840 --> 47:29.840
to handle it with any kind of a plum.

47:29.840 --> 47:31.840
I feel like I'll just...

47:31.840 --> 47:33.840
You're going to be a baby.

47:33.840 --> 47:35.840
I'm going to make it everyone's problem.

47:35.840 --> 47:37.840
But I don't want to. I don't want to do that.

47:37.840 --> 47:39.840
I want to be one of those people that keeps their...

47:39.840 --> 47:41.840
You're that guy.

47:41.840 --> 47:43.840
I don't want to do that.

47:43.840 --> 47:45.840
We'll deal with it.

47:45.840 --> 47:47.840
I don't want anyone to deal with it.

47:47.840 --> 47:49.840
I can't wait to deal with it.

47:49.840 --> 47:51.840
I'm joking.

47:51.840 --> 47:53.840
Well, let's practice.

47:53.840 --> 47:55.840
Let's do like a role-playing.

47:55.840 --> 47:57.840
I hope this isn't how you get the disease.

47:57.840 --> 47:59.840
I'm not going to hit him properly.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.840
I feel like if God's listening, he's like,

48:01.840 --> 48:03.840
oh, you thought that was hilarious,

48:03.840 --> 48:05.840
that bit where you pretended to be dying.

48:05.840 --> 48:07.840
Let's just say I have like a...

48:07.840 --> 48:09.840
Just give me an illness foot.

48:09.840 --> 48:11.840
Well, chance cancer is...

48:11.840 --> 48:13.840
Okay, that's the time.

48:13.840 --> 48:15.840
Jesus.

48:15.840 --> 48:17.840
Foot.

48:17.840 --> 48:19.840
Okay.

48:19.840 --> 48:21.840
Wait, hold on.

48:21.840 --> 48:23.840
Sorry.

48:23.840 --> 48:25.840
Stop.

48:25.840 --> 48:27.840
Muscular dystrophy.

48:27.840 --> 48:29.840
That's a nice specific.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.840
Okay.

48:31.840 --> 48:33.840
I just want to practice this.

48:33.840 --> 48:35.840
Dino, I just got back from the doctor

48:35.840 --> 48:37.840
and I have muscular dystrophy.

48:37.840 --> 48:39.840
That?

48:39.840 --> 48:41.840
The Jerry Lewis disease?

48:41.840 --> 48:43.840
Yeah.

48:43.840 --> 48:45.840
It's fucked up.

48:45.840 --> 48:47.840
Kids get that.

48:47.840 --> 48:49.840
What took you so long?

48:51.840 --> 48:53.840
The fuck?

48:53.840 --> 48:55.840
Whatever.

48:57.840 --> 48:59.840
See you in the hospital.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.840
Well, that's not so bad.

49:03.840 --> 49:05.840
Yeah.

49:05.840 --> 49:07.840
I guess...

49:07.840 --> 49:09.840
Yeah.

49:09.840 --> 49:11.840
At least it's muscular.

49:11.840 --> 49:13.840
Yeah.

49:13.840 --> 49:15.840
You don't have muscles.

49:15.840 --> 49:17.840
Sounds macho.

49:17.840 --> 49:19.840
I'll find the humor in it.

49:19.840 --> 49:21.840
As long as there's zero pain

49:21.840 --> 49:23.840
or discomfort involved,

49:23.840 --> 49:25.840
and I live forever,

49:25.840 --> 49:27.840
I'll handle it perfectly.

49:27.840 --> 49:29.840
I didn't get your name.

49:29.840 --> 49:31.840
Rick.

49:31.840 --> 49:33.840
A name that I made famous.

49:33.840 --> 49:35.840
Let's see.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.840
Rick, what do you do?

49:37.840 --> 49:39.840
I'm a video editor.

49:39.840 --> 49:41.840
You're a video editor?

49:41.840 --> 49:43.840
He's a final cutter avid.

49:43.840 --> 49:45.840
Avid mostly.

49:45.840 --> 49:47.840
Sony Vegas avid.

49:47.840 --> 49:49.840
Do you ever touch the mouse?

49:49.840 --> 49:51.840
Or are you badass?

49:51.840 --> 49:53.840
I'm badass.

49:53.840 --> 49:55.840
Mouses were pussy.

49:55.840 --> 49:57.840
Yeah.

49:57.840 --> 49:59.840
Not for their pretzel ear friends

49:59.840 --> 50:01.840
in the audience.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.840
Yeah.

50:03.840 --> 50:05.840
Pussy like delicious.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.840
Final cut is like

50:11.840 --> 50:13.840
editing with boxing gloves on.

50:13.840 --> 50:15.840
Yeah.

50:15.840 --> 50:17.840
Do you cut actors' reels?

50:17.840 --> 50:19.840
Sometimes.

50:19.840 --> 50:21.840
After the show,

50:21.840 --> 50:23.840
if you could just cut a good

50:23.840 --> 50:25.840
three minutes for me.

50:25.840 --> 50:27.840
Communities over.

50:27.840 --> 50:29.840
I got nothing.

50:29.840 --> 50:31.840
Nice.

50:31.840 --> 50:33.840
Where do you live?

50:33.840 --> 50:35.840
Ohio.

50:35.840 --> 50:37.840
You've made a whole pilgrimage here.

50:37.840 --> 50:39.840
Do you go to a lot of conventions?

50:39.840 --> 50:41.840
I go to a few.

50:41.840 --> 50:43.840
Do you go to San Diego?

50:43.840 --> 50:45.840
No, too big.

50:45.840 --> 50:47.840
It's become too corporate.

50:47.840 --> 50:49.840
Oren like me can't keep.

50:49.840 --> 50:51.840
You gotta walk so much.

50:51.840 --> 50:53.840
Yeah.

50:53.840 --> 50:55.840
I'm part of the problem.

50:55.840 --> 50:57.840
Our sitcom should be here,

50:57.840 --> 50:59.840
but that was the problem.

50:59.840 --> 51:01.840
It became like can for nerds.

51:01.840 --> 51:03.840
And then became a can,

51:03.840 --> 51:05.840
regular can.

51:05.840 --> 51:07.840
And people are just like

51:07.840 --> 51:09.840
cattle prodding.

51:09.840 --> 51:11.840
What is this, a picture book?

51:11.840 --> 51:13.840
Get out of here.

51:13.840 --> 51:15.840
Bruce Willis is coming through.

51:15.840 --> 51:17.840
Why do I start

51:17.840 --> 51:19.840
sentences?

51:19.840 --> 51:21.840
What was I going to say?

51:21.840 --> 51:23.840
How far can you walk without it

51:23.840 --> 51:25.840
hurting?

51:25.840 --> 51:27.840
This is interesting.

51:27.840 --> 51:29.840
Half a mile.

51:29.840 --> 51:31.840
You're in pretty good shape.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.840
Do you have family?

51:33.840 --> 51:35.840
One left, yeah.

51:35.840 --> 51:37.840
One left?

51:37.840 --> 51:39.840
One family member?

51:39.840 --> 51:41.840
Dad died in October.

51:41.840 --> 51:43.840
Mom is on her last list.

51:43.840 --> 51:45.840
Because you're so old,

51:45.840 --> 51:47.840
we immediately pictured dead children.

51:47.840 --> 51:49.840
Are you a farmer from the 1800s?

51:51.840 --> 51:53.840
One left.

51:53.840 --> 51:55.840
Jesus.

51:55.840 --> 51:57.840
Only half are going to get out of here.

51:57.840 --> 51:59.840
Yeah, you got to have 30 to get

51:59.840 --> 52:01.840
two crops.

52:03.840 --> 52:05.840
I don't know how to do a farmer.

52:05.840 --> 52:07.840
When you said, oh mom and dad,

52:07.840 --> 52:09.840
this guy is my hero,

52:09.840 --> 52:11.840
you made it all the way to 53,

52:11.840 --> 52:13.840
and you're just like me,

52:13.840 --> 52:15.840
you're like a man child.

52:15.840 --> 52:17.840
I got a vasectomy when I was 21.

52:17.840 --> 52:19.840
God, you love pain down there.

52:19.840 --> 52:21.840
Oh, I do.

52:21.840 --> 52:23.840
I'm not sure for that.

52:23.840 --> 52:25.840
We got to talk.

52:25.840 --> 52:27.840
You knew at 21,

52:27.840 --> 52:29.840
definitely never going to have a need for...

52:29.840 --> 52:31.840
I was dating a 42 year old woman,

52:31.840 --> 52:33.840
and she said,

52:33.840 --> 52:35.840
you want to throw that shit around,

52:35.840 --> 52:37.840
you better get a vasectomy.

52:37.840 --> 52:39.840
You mean your dick?

52:39.840 --> 52:41.840
The sperm.

52:41.840 --> 52:43.840
What do you do with it?

52:43.840 --> 52:45.840
You throw it around?

52:45.840 --> 52:47.840
I thought if you threw it around,

52:47.840 --> 52:49.840
you couldn't get any...

52:49.840 --> 52:51.840
You pay extra for that.

52:51.840 --> 52:53.840
You're like a monkey.

52:53.840 --> 52:55.840
It's like serpent in the rainbow.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.840
He blows it in their face.

52:57.840 --> 52:59.840
It's really romantic.

52:59.840 --> 53:01.840
Don't let them bury me.

53:01.840 --> 53:03.840
He does it very romantically.

53:03.840 --> 53:05.840
He does it very romantically.

53:09.840 --> 53:11.840
Nothing law clear,

53:11.840 --> 53:13.840
swears by that.

53:13.840 --> 53:15.840
All right.

53:15.840 --> 53:17.840
So 21 years old,

53:17.840 --> 53:19.840
that's an interesting story,

53:19.840 --> 53:21.840
because your girlfriend at the time

53:21.840 --> 53:23.840
was...

53:23.840 --> 53:25.840
Am I wrong,

53:25.840 --> 53:27.840
or is this offensive to assume

53:27.840 --> 53:29.840
the reason she was particularly...

53:29.840 --> 53:31.840
Because it's actually dangerous.

53:31.840 --> 53:33.840
She's like, I don't want to have kids.

53:33.840 --> 53:35.840
Did she already have kids?

53:35.840 --> 53:37.840
Her son was my best friend in high school.

53:39.840 --> 53:41.840
This guy is

53:41.840 --> 53:43.840
the James Bond of Comic-Con.

53:43.840 --> 53:45.840
Standing ovation, everyone.

53:45.840 --> 53:47.840
Standing ovation.

53:53.840 --> 53:55.840
Now, we want to make sure

53:55.840 --> 53:57.840
we would all do that

53:57.840 --> 53:59.840
if the genders were reversed, right?

53:59.840 --> 54:01.840
If a young woman were up here,

54:01.840 --> 54:03.840
I ran through that test

54:03.840 --> 54:05.840
on my head.

54:05.840 --> 54:07.840
I would still...

54:07.840 --> 54:09.840
Crush that dick, honey.

54:09.840 --> 54:11.840
No.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.840
Crush that old

54:17.840 --> 54:19.840
dad of your friend's dick.

54:19.840 --> 54:21.840
Poison Ivy, that shit.

54:25.840 --> 54:27.840
Not the Poison Ivy that half of those people

54:27.840 --> 54:29.840
are dressed as out there.

54:29.840 --> 54:31.840
The movie with the...

54:31.840 --> 54:33.840
Which one was...

54:33.840 --> 54:35.840
There were two that came at the same time, Poison Ivy,

54:35.840 --> 54:37.840
and then there was...

54:37.840 --> 54:39.840
Drew Barrymore, was she Poison Ivy?

54:41.840 --> 54:43.840
Uma Thurman was...

54:43.840 --> 54:45.840
No, you guys, stop that.

54:45.840 --> 54:47.840
Are you serious? You're that young.

54:47.840 --> 54:49.840
There was a movie about...

54:57.840 --> 54:59.840
Will everyone in the audience

54:59.840 --> 55:01.840
please come up here and grab a mic?

55:01.840 --> 55:03.840
All right.

55:03.840 --> 55:05.840
Let's have a hand for Rick and...

55:05.840 --> 55:07.840
Rick!

55:07.840 --> 55:09.840
Rick!

55:09.840 --> 55:11.840
Thank you very much.

55:11.840 --> 55:13.840
Thank you for sharing your...

55:13.840 --> 55:15.840
your...

55:15.840 --> 55:17.840
I like that he earned it, too.

55:17.840 --> 55:19.840
Like, if we got that information

55:19.840 --> 55:21.840
on the wrong order,

55:21.840 --> 55:23.840
we would have been like, who are you trying to impress?

55:23.840 --> 55:25.840
But he's like, look.

55:25.840 --> 55:27.840
Sometimes ninja stars made of calcium

55:27.840 --> 55:29.840
come out of my dick and it hurts.

55:29.840 --> 55:31.840
I gotta have a sec to me.

55:31.840 --> 55:33.840
I live with my parents.

55:33.840 --> 55:35.840
I don't think...

55:35.840 --> 55:37.840
I fucked my friend's mom in high school!

55:39.840 --> 55:41.840
We were rooting for him at that point.

55:41.840 --> 55:43.840
Yeah.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.840
I want to clear up a misconception.

55:45.840 --> 55:47.840
He was 21 when he had sex with that woman.

55:47.840 --> 55:49.840
This was out of high school.

55:49.840 --> 55:51.840
They were friends in high school,

55:51.840 --> 55:53.840
but this was, you know, after high school.

55:53.840 --> 55:55.840
It's not quite as cool.

55:55.840 --> 55:57.840
Well, it's actually...

55:57.840 --> 55:59.840
It's really cool.

55:59.840 --> 56:01.840
Don't get me wrong, it's really cool,

56:01.840 --> 56:03.840
guy, yeah.

56:03.840 --> 56:05.840
It's not as dramatic.

56:05.840 --> 56:07.840
It's arguably a little healthier,

56:07.840 --> 56:09.840
because you know...

56:09.840 --> 56:11.840
A lot of people don't know this,

56:11.840 --> 56:13.840
but Spencer is Rick's biographer.

56:13.840 --> 56:15.840
Yeah.

56:15.840 --> 56:17.840
It just so happens,

56:17.840 --> 56:19.840
he's the oldest guy here.

56:19.840 --> 56:21.840
Yeah, no one asked me any questions

56:21.840 --> 56:23.840
about his kidney stones.

56:23.840 --> 56:25.840
You were very suspiciously quiet during that interview.

56:25.840 --> 56:27.840
Do we have any beats?

56:27.840 --> 56:29.840
Do you have any rap beats?

56:29.840 --> 56:31.840
Wait, really?

56:31.840 --> 56:33.840
I thought Dustin had some beats.

56:33.840 --> 56:35.840
He's getting them, he's getting them.

56:35.840 --> 56:37.840
Oh, sorry, I only saw Steve Levy.

56:37.840 --> 56:39.840
This is where I take a pee break, right?

56:39.840 --> 56:41.840
Yeah, go ahead.

56:41.840 --> 56:43.840
Yo.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.840
Yo.

56:45.840 --> 56:47.840
Ha-ha.

56:47.840 --> 56:49.840
Yeah, do the ha-ha.

56:49.840 --> 56:51.840
Give it to him.

56:51.840 --> 56:53.840
Give it to him, man.

56:53.840 --> 56:55.840
Yo.

56:55.840 --> 56:57.840
Ha-ha.

56:57.840 --> 56:59.840
M to the A-M-I.

56:59.840 --> 57:01.840
Did I spell that right?

57:03.840 --> 57:05.840
M to the I to the A-M-I.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.840
I fucked your mama so hard

57:07.840 --> 57:09.840
that she started to cry,

57:09.840 --> 57:11.840
but it wasn't, it was from joy.

57:13.840 --> 57:15.840
Yo.

57:15.840 --> 57:17.840
Yo. Yo.

57:17.840 --> 57:19.840
The peninsula of this state

57:19.840 --> 57:21.840
is shaped like my wiener.

57:21.840 --> 57:23.840
When I go on a date,

57:23.840 --> 57:25.840
I like to dip it in the ocean

57:25.840 --> 57:27.840
and whip it around.

57:27.840 --> 57:29.840
I'm like, Rick.

57:29.840 --> 57:31.840
Who was up here before?

57:33.840 --> 57:35.840
All right.

57:35.840 --> 57:37.840
Starting over, starting over.

57:37.840 --> 57:39.840
Yeah.

57:39.840 --> 57:41.840
Yo. Yo.

57:41.840 --> 57:43.840
Yo. Yo. Yo.

57:43.840 --> 57:45.840
Give it to him.

57:45.840 --> 57:47.840
Batman's and Pikachu's.

57:47.840 --> 57:49.840
Kamikaz.

57:49.840 --> 57:55.840
With the Jews.

57:57.840 --> 57:59.840
I'm assuming they're here, too.

58:01.840 --> 58:03.840
It doesn't, but it's not related.

58:03.840 --> 58:05.840
I'm going to start over.

58:05.840 --> 58:07.840
Yo.

58:07.840 --> 58:09.840
Yo. Yo. Yo.

58:09.840 --> 58:11.840
Yo.

58:11.840 --> 58:15.840
Magic airport convention hall.

58:15.840 --> 58:17.840
I fucked your mama and she was appalled.

58:17.840 --> 58:19.840
She said, holy shit,

58:19.840 --> 58:21.840
you gave it to me good.

58:21.840 --> 58:23.840
I went in the basement

58:23.840 --> 58:25.840
and worked with some wood.

58:25.840 --> 58:27.840
I built her a rocking chair.

58:27.840 --> 58:29.840
I built her a sled.

58:29.840 --> 58:31.840
I built her a doghouse.

58:31.840 --> 58:33.840
I built her a bed.

58:33.840 --> 58:35.840
And a shed in the bed.

58:35.840 --> 58:37.840
Most people put a bed in a shed,

58:37.840 --> 58:39.840
but I put a shed

58:39.840 --> 58:41.840
inside the bed

58:41.840 --> 58:43.840
and I got inside

58:43.840 --> 58:47.840
and I fucked the shed.

58:47.840 --> 58:49.840
And then your mama was dead,

58:49.840 --> 58:51.840
but I didn't do it.

58:51.840 --> 58:53.840
I was framed.

58:53.840 --> 58:55.840
Yo.

59:01.840 --> 59:03.840
Oh, God.

59:03.840 --> 59:05.840
Where did you go?

59:05.840 --> 59:07.840
I went to pee.

59:07.840 --> 59:09.840
I really rushed.

59:09.840 --> 59:11.840
I zipped up too quickly.

59:11.840 --> 59:13.840
Come down on your podium.

59:13.840 --> 59:15.840
Oh, man.

59:15.840 --> 59:17.840
One time I was at the beach

59:17.840 --> 59:19.840
and I got knocked over by a wave

59:19.840 --> 59:21.840
and it took my pants off

59:21.840 --> 59:23.840
and I had to pull them on

59:23.840 --> 59:25.840
and it turned out the zipper was down

59:25.840 --> 59:27.840
so I pulled up my zipper.

59:27.840 --> 59:29.840
And yeah, that's what happened.

59:29.840 --> 59:31.840
Yeah.

59:31.840 --> 59:33.840
And then I was in the salt water.

59:33.840 --> 59:35.840
No, no, no.

59:35.840 --> 59:37.840
It was instantly disinfected

59:37.840 --> 59:39.840
and everything was healthy from then on.

59:39.840 --> 59:41.840
Like I just...

59:41.840 --> 59:43.840
I'm 51.

59:43.840 --> 59:45.840
I don't know.

59:45.840 --> 59:47.840
I think that just might be technique

59:47.840 --> 59:49.840
because I thought I was like 20,

59:49.840 --> 59:51.840
but it was my technique was way off.

59:51.840 --> 59:53.840
Having peed in one of those diapers,

59:53.840 --> 59:55.840
I peed in a diaper in a...

59:55.840 --> 59:57.840
I heard, yeah.

59:57.840 --> 59:59.840
It was very brave of me.

59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.840
Does it feel good?

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.840
It's amazing.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:05.840
That's why it's hard to

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.840
toilet-train kids

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.840
because they love it. It's nice and warm.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.840
But I didn't know...

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.840
I thought it would be damp or something.

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.840
It's like when you pee in the shower,

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.840
that feeling of freedom,

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.840
like you're just like...

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.840
I bet it reminds you of being in the womb

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.840
because you probably just pee in your mom.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.840
I don't think you pee in the womb.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.840
Yeah, what does happen in there?

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.840
For sure you pee.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.840
I think the umbilical cord deals with the waist.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.840
I don't think you do that.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.840
I mean, when you are born,

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.840
it just falls out, right?

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.840
Because that would happen.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.840
No.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.840
It's that way you're water-breaking, yes.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.840
It's all...

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.840
It's all fetus pee.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.840
Fetus pee.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.840
If you guys want to see fetus pee,

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.840
we're playing down at the...

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.840
Spencer's on bass,

01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:59.840
and I'm a drummer,

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.840
but the lead singer. I'm like Phil Collins.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.840
He was a singer in the 1700s.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.840
He's like Mickey Dolan's.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.840
Rick gets it.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.840
Okay, all right.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.840
So, like, wait,

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.840
I forgot, I lost my train of thought.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.840
And boy, it was I on a train of thought.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.840
Just give me one second.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.840
Tourette's?

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.840
Yeah.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.840
I'm not going to fill in for you.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.840
I'm no Jeff Davis here.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.840
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.840
Well, yeah, you should...

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.840
Is this where Jeff Davis says something funny?

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.840
Yeah, you have to help me.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.840
If I'm flouting, you have to help.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.840
Ask Dan a pointed question.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.840
What were you thinking of?

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.840
I can't remember.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.840
I was actually going to ask Spencer.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.840
I haven't hung out with you all day.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.840
I was wondering, did you wander around the con?

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.840
And did you have any experiences?

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.840
I got in.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.840
I charged my phone.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.840
I don't know. I kept using my phone while I was

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.840
supposed to be charging it, so the end result

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.840
is hilarious stuff.

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.840
No, I don't know.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.840
I got some empanadas.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.840
You guys like empanadas, right?

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:07.840
And then it came here.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.840
Did you get the hotel empanadas?

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.840
No, no. Do they have those?

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.840
Yeah, they got slow cook lamb empanadas.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.840
Did you think of what you're trying to think of yet?

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.840
No, that was it. I wanted to actually...

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.840
Oh, that was it? Oh, I'm sorry about yelling.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.840
Yeah.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.840
Is that what Jeff does? Yell at you?

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.840
No, well, he challenges me sometimes.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.840
I don't do that.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.840
And then when he gets drunk, sometimes he gets

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.840
inexplicably angry about things like...

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.840
Like chain zingers?

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.840
It was insane.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.840
Like, he was so angry about chain zingers.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.840
Wow.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.840
It's kind of like hanging out with you guys.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.840
That's why I don't listen.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.840
Yeah.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.840
All right.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.840
Well, who in the audience

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.840
has a convention

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.840
kind of...

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.840
I don't know who's in pain,

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.840
but I think

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.840
Rick...

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.840
I can't do it anymore.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.840
Like, who...

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.840
You're already raising your hand.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.840
Crohn's disease. It's tons of fun.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.840
I don't want to talk about your Crohn's.

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:13.840
I just support your Crohn's.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.840
No, I hate your Crohn's. I don't support it.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.840
I want to hear

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.840
a convention like encounter or story

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.840
or something that somebody...

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.840
Okay.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.840
You want to come up, sir,

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.840
and share your...

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.840
Is it good enough to walk

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.840
up here and say it?

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.840
Woo!

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.840
Woo!

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.840
Grab that mic.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.840
What's your name, sir?

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.840
I'm Russell.

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.840
Oh, shit. I think I have something.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.840
Oh, yeah. I actually gave Spencer

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.840
some Tito's to give to me.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.840
Oh, that's nice. Thank you.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.840
Why Tito's?

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.840
Why Tito's?

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.840
You know he drinks kettle.

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.840
It's the best vodka.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.840
It's made in copper

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.840
kettles and it's

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.840
from Texas.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.840
I'm flustered, so...

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.840
It's Indy.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.840
Yeah, it's from Austin,

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.840
so it's Indy. It's made by

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.840
people who make yogurt and typewriters.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.840
You know he's going to throw it away.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.840
He's just going to throw it away.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.840
No, that's not true.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.840
You like Tito's, right?

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.840
What are you holding there?

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.840
Are you a vaping?

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.840
Oh, yeah. It's an oil pen.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.840
It has some hash oil in it.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.840
Sorry, I'm still holding it.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.840
I should be holding it right now.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.840
So, what's your convention story?

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.840
I actually went to the bathroom

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.840
to go wash my hands and there was

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.840
somebody in a very extensive

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.840
gender swap costume,

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.840
cosplay, sorry, and

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.840
take a double take at the door

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.840
sign and

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.840
make sure that I wasn't in the

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.840
female's bathroom with a female

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.840
that had her boyfriend in the bathroom

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.840
with her.

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.840
Yeah, I just thought

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.840
there was a female in the bathroom

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.840
and it just turned out to be a child

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.840
in a cosplay that was a gender swap.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.840
Tell the rest of the story.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.840
And

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.840
I urinated in my shoe

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.840
and then I thought about Dino

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.840
and then I thought about a dominatrix

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.840
and then I came here and

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.840
I'm going to throw that tears away.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.840
Good.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.840
They're all judging you now because

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.840
they're like, so you encountered the modern world?

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.840
I'm starting

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.840
the lights on me and

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.840
I don't know what to say.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.840
What do you think of like,

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.840
we should probably

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.840
at this point, we should escape

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.840
the restroom question becomes

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.840
too complicated. We should just have unisex

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.840
bathrooms, right?

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.840
Do you give an opinion about that?

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.840
I mean, when it

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.840
really comes to it, you know, in the 21st

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.840
century, you know, it shouldn't be

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.840
really what parts

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.840
you're born with. It should really be

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.840
what you identify as and what you're presenting as

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.840
and you should be able to go to the bathroom

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.840
and, you know, into

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:03.840
the gender that you feel that you...

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.840
Right, but do you, well, yeah, I mean, yeah,

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.840
we all know what to say that's appropriate.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.840
No, I'm being serious.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.840
No, I don't doubt that you believe it.

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.840
I'm just saying like, I, yeah,

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.840
I'm asking the question, given that fact,

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.840
like, should we, should

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.840
bathrooms, should we just fuse the bathrooms

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.840
or should we continue to do dichotomous

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.840
bathrooms? I don't think women would agree

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.840
with that. Women need more...

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.840
You know how much masturbating there's going to be

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.840
in bathrooms?

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.840
Biologically need to spend more

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:33.840
time in the bathroom. That's not like a

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.840
sexist thing, but like, apparently, for peeing, it takes

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.840
longer, like, physically.

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.840
Like, women need more access

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.840
to bathrooms than men do per

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.840
unit space in a proper

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.840
urban planning situation. Yeah, yeah.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.840
Which is, I mean, I'm not, I'm not trying to

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.840
shit on your great idea or anything.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.840
And also, you know how much masturbating there would be?

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.840
Be a lot of masturbating.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.840
I mean, I mean, by me,

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.840
I just, I'm a chicken,

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.840
so if I was, like, running society, I would

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:01.840
just do the thing that, even if it

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.840
was an inconvenience to, like, a large group

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.840
of people, I would be like, well, I just don't want

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.840
to be doing wrong things, so let's just

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.840
do the simple thing that'll mean that no one's

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.840
ever offended or whatever. Let's merge

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.840
the bathrooms, but it's

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.840
interesting that it could be, yeah, you'd be

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.840
fucking people over in the name of, like,

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.840
making me as the mayor of this society feel

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.840
better about myself.

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.840
Because I could just pee, well,

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.840
in my pants, I found out.

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.840
Yeah, last week kind of found out you

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.840
could pee in your pants.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.840
There was a situation, I was in New York

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.840
where it occurred to me, I was like, oh man,

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.840
at the library bar, there was

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.840
a men's room and a women's room, but they made

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.840
them both unisex, and I was like, oh man,

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.840
that, that's the best sex for the women,

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.840
because, like, that used to be the women's room,

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.840
and it's like, now it's got fucking,

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.840
because I went in there and the seat was up

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.840
and there was fucking orange pee.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.840
You go to the drawing room where there's a

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.840
men's room and a women's room, the women's room,

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.840
great place to do coke in.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.840
Men's room, not so good, you don't want

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.840
anything going through your nose in that place.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.840
But maybe we need to just do, like,

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.840
tiered bathrooms, like platinum

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.840
bathroom.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:07.840
All right, well, okay,

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.840
so what was the costume?

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.840
Can you tell us, are you afraid you're going to like...

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.840
I honestly really don't know, it was an anime

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.840
costume, I'm not very familiar

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:17.840
with anime, so...

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.840
What do you think of this Deadpool fellow?

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.840
I think the movie is going

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.840
to be, uh, receptive,

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.840
but it probably...

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.840
The movie's going to be receptive!

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.840
What a bold choice!

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.840
I mean...

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.840
It thought I was a hit!

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.840
Says Gene Shallot.

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.840
I'm truly receptive, Phil!

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.840
I'm so sorry,

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.840
I'll do anything for a laugh.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.840
I'm jumping all over,

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.840
because I never misspeak.

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.840
Honestly, you're making my taste

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.840
really good shit, either way.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.840
I just don't think

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.840
it's going to be

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.840
the circle jerk that everybody thinks

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.840
that's going to be.

01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.840
You're saying

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.840
you don't think it's going to be

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.840
God's gift to...

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.840
Yes, it's not going to be this

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.840
Uber

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.840
Mobius

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.840
strip of meta humor

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.840
and Deadpool

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.840
and the whole X-Men thing.

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.840
I really think they're just going to try to fit in

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.840
him just acknowledging the crowd

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.840
and this little humor and this and that,

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.840
and they're really just going to not really do too much

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.840
with it today.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.840
I don't have a full panel of a Deadpool comic,

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.840
but I've read the Wikipedia page

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.840
and I appreciate that.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.840
I'm sure a bunch of...

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.840
From reading the description of it,

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.840
I'm like, oh, I'm sure I have a ton of fans

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.840
that are Deadpool fans

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.840
and Ryan Reynolds is a huge fan of it

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.840
and has been wanting to make the movie.

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.840
What is the...

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.840
What is the good version?

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.840
I kind of know what you're talking about.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.840
Spencer never talked about this.

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:53.840
There's a bad version of meta.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.840
Like if they do just do it sloppy and lazy,

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.840
then he just goes like, oh, it's like I'm in a movie.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.840
It's going to be like Space Jam or something.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.840
The...

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.840
But what's the subtle,

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.840
sophisticated...

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.840
What does he do in the comic book that is the

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.840
good version of Breaking the Fourth?

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.840
Wow, that's what I'm confused by.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.840
To be honest, I haven't read too many.

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.840
But you're our Deadpool expert.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.840
I brought you up here.

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.840
No.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.840
It's the what?

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.840
Oh, sorry.

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.840
What the fuck?

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.840
What the fuck?

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.840
Can I just stack it down?

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.840
Holy shit.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.840
What the fuck?

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.840
Why did you just physically...

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.840
Get that guy!

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.840
Okay, I tried.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.840
Is there security here?

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.840
Are you alright?

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.840
Jesus Christ.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.840
Usually when people rush the stage,

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.840
nothing bad happens.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.840
This guy's got a black eye.

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.840
Are you?

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.840
Yes, you do.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.840
I mean, I'm not going to ask if you're okay.

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.840
I was just helping you out.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.840
We thought this was going to be a bad show.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.840
I'm sorry that happened to you, man.

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.840
That's really shitty.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.840
I'm so sorry that it happened to you.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.840
Did it hurt?

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.840
Okay, it hurt when you got punched.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.840
I fell down in the chair.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.840
What about punching him?

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.840
Wait, what?

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.840
Just punch this guy.

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.840
He has to be removed.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.840
He's an insane person that hurts other people.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.840
Jesus.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.840
I don't understand.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.840
I think...

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.840
Do you need...

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.840
Do you need...

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.840
Would you know if you needed an actual doctor?

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.840
Do you need like a...

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.840
Do you need like a...

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.840
I mean, the guy should be arrested.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.840
Yeah, I've had a cerebral hematoma before.

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.840
So I know what a concussion

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.840
and what blood

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.840
what blood in your brain feels like.

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.840
I mean, we should have hooked on to that guy.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.840
Welcome to my army, bitch!

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.840
Ha ha ha ha!

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.840
So what...

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.840
In what spirit was that just said?

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.840
Do you think it's funny that he was physically assaulted?

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.840
I think he was just trying to be funny.

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:15.840
No, you're not invited up here.

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.840
Please forgive us for not wanting you

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:19.840
to run up on stage.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.840
I think that was somebody I knew.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.840
Yes.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.840
You know...

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.840
This wasn't a planned thing.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.840
I hope not.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.840
That would be really a bad plan.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.840
You can explain.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.840
I'm going to cater to his comfort right now.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.840
Wait, really?

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.840
Do you want to press charges?

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.840
You won't press charges?

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:45.840
And this wasn't planned?

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.840
No!

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.840
I don't think this was planned.

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.840
It's going to shine up.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.840
I mean, I've had my nose broken

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.840
by a belligerent driver before.

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.840
So again, it's nothing I haven't been through.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.840
It's cool.

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.840
Florida's great.

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.840
This is exactly what I expected Florida to be like.

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.840
Ha ha ha ha!

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.840
So...

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.840
Ha ha ha ha!

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.840
Ha ha ha ha!

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.840
Ha ha ha ha!

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.840
Everybody calm down.

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.840
Well, don't calm down.

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.840
You can continue to be excited.

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:21.840
You have my permission to react in an excited way.

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.840
I don't know how to put this together.

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.840
Someone else is going to get hurt.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.840
Don't devolve into a mob.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.840
I'm interested too.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.840
Let's talk about what just happened.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.840
Ha ha ha ha!

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.840
Yeah, how do you know this guy?

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.840
Well, I mean...

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.840
I've actually known him for...

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.840
Oh, Jesus, here it comes.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.840
Like, six years?

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.840
Okay.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.840
And I kind of think he...

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.840
He kind of gets himself

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.840
a little riled up

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.840
and...

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.840
into situations.

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:57.840
I think he was kind of...

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.840
...

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.840
...

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.840
...

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.840
...

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.840
I'm kind of

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.840
not interested anymore.

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.840
I don't think

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:13.840
his actions were justified, but...

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.840
I thought they were.

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.840
I thought he had a great...

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.840
...

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.840
His point seemed very clear.

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.840
Ha ha ha ha!

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.840
Um...

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.840
Are you traumatized?

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.840
I mean, no offense, but if that happened to me,

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.840
I'd be very shaken up.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.840
I'd not be able to carry on

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.840
with these comedic stylings like this.

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.840
Quite honestly,

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.840
the only reason why I'm pressing on

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.840
is only because it gets me more stage time.

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.840
Yeah.

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.840
So it was planned.

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.840
No, it wasn't planned at all.

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.840
I'm actually really pissed off on him.

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.840
I kind of don't want to give him a ride home right now.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.840
I feel like the cops

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.840
got that covered.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.840
Well, can you...

01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.840
You seem to be very...

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.840
I don't want you to talk about anything you don't want to talk about,

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.840
but I'm just making the observation.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.840
I feel my face blowing up. I'm sorry.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.840
What's that? I feel my left cheek.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.840
Do you want to go and put ice on it and stuff?

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.840
Or do you want to stay here?

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.840
The guy who was physically assaulted,

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.840
whatever you want,

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.840
happens for now.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.840
I've had my nose broken by a belligerent driver down here before,

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.840
so it's not...

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.840
It sounds like you're asking for things.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.840
No, the people who died here fucking suck a lot.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.840
We'd like to talk about that, though.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.840
And if you don't want to,

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.840
then we can...

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.840
For our full support, we can...

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.840
Let's move on.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.840
No, I'd move on.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.840
Then they're going to be like,

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.840
what the fuck? The show needs to pay attention

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.840
to the thing that happened.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.840
It was his friend.

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.840
It's your friend.

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.840
So can I ask you a couple...

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.840
You're...

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:55.840
Thanks, Steve.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.840
Is he just like your crazy knucklehead friend?

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.840
Yeah, he actually lives in Oxnard

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.840
about an hour away from you guys.

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.840
Oh, that's a bad place, too.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.840
He moved over there a few years ago.

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.840
Hold on.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.840
Like, that means, like, Ox Testicle, right?

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.840
I have no idea.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.840
Who would name a city that?

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:27.840
And I mean, I'm not just saying that

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.840
because I heard of it. Like, I grew up...

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.840
Like you said, that's somewhere I'm used to.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.840
It's a weird place that people tend not to go.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.840
Is this a relationship like

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.840
the Renner Herzog movie,

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.840
My Best Fiend?

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.840
Like, is he just a...

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.840
Actually, now that Dino's here

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.840
and we can bring this up, yes,

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.840
it actually kind of is like My Best Fiend.

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.840
He's around, get really pissed off at him,

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.840
kind of scream at him sometimes,

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.840
but he can also be a

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.840
really fun time and we can do

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.840
lots of great stuff together.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.840
And, you know, he's just that kind of guy

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.840
that gets a little out of bounds

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.840
unnecessarily and...

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.840
Unknowingly. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.840
I'm going to ask you a multiple-choice question.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.840
He did that

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.840
because he's a.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.840
Crazy. B.

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.840
Mad at you. C.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.840
Has a really terrible sense of humor.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.840
I think he's actually calling me, right?

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.840
D. It was a bit...

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:23.840
They planned out.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.840
It was like some sad Andy Kaufman-esque...

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.840
I actually think he's just pissed off

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:29.840
that I came on stage and then

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.840
talked about Deadpool and was like,

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.840
oh, I can't talk about Deadpool

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.840
because I don't know anything about it.

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.840
That's why I punch people.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.840
That's what I thought of

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.840
when I saw myself on the ground.

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.840
I was like, I fucked up.

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.840
I didn't make him proud.

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.840
Sorry, dad.

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.840
That's so sad that that's where you defaulted

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.840
to after being attacked randomly

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.840
by a friend.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.840
Yeah, well, yeah.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.840
The attack was random.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.840
The friend is known to be

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.840
a nutcracker.

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.840
Not to that extent, but...

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.840
He's heckled you.

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.840
Actually, when he came to Supercon 2014,

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.840
when he did your Q&A...

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.840
See, I knew there was a Supercon.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:13.840
I actually stopped a few times,

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.840
but...

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.840
Do you remember any specifics?

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:19.840
He said take off your shirt.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.840
He just said take off your shirt.

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.840
Lots of people tell me.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:25.840
He's actually the Tourette's guy also.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.840
Oh, is he?

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.840
So he was just fucking wasted, probably, right?

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:31.840
We have been drinking

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.840
some local beers

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.840
for the day today, so I guess he's probably more wasted

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.840
than I was.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:39.840
Those local beers are like bath salts, lager.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.840
Special K...

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.840
Special K...

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.840
Anheuser...

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.840
No, it's all flock of flavor.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.840
That's what it is. It's all flock of...

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.840
Can I just say you're being an excellent sport?

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.840
Like, I am impressed.

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.840
I'm...

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.840
Oh, please.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.840
It was his best friend.

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.840
Well, yeah, but...

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.840
Yes, I mean...

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.840
He's not being that good of a sport.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.840
They have a silly, terrible

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.840
unbalanced relationship.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.840
He's really...

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.840
He's a battered wife is what he is.

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.840
I'm not a sport.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.840
Is that what you call a battered wife, Spencer?

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.840
He was such a good sport.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.840
They are!

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.840
Do you think they're poor sports?

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.840
Are you going to give that to battered women?

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.840
They're also poor sports

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:29.840
on top of everything else.

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.840
You guys are a race

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.840
for the high roads.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.840
You're going to hit the stratosphere

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.840
and asphyxiate each other.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.840
All right, well...

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.840
Is everyone else satisfied

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.840
we can move on?

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.840
Yes! For God's sake!

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.840
Well, I didn't...

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:49.840
Look, I wanted to know more.

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.840
I felt like you guys,

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.840
if I didn't help you

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.840
investigate, that you'd be like,

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.840
why isn't he talking about the thing

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.840
with the thing?

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.840
But I guess I'm getting a...

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.840
maybe not a clear picture, but I can categorize it now.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.840
Was he the guy that was videotaping?

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.840
That was someone else.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.840
Okay, you guys are fine. Don't worry about it.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.840
All right, well...

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.840
I guess maybe Deadpool

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.840
will be a bad movie.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.840
I guess at this point

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:19.840
it's kind of looking like it.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.840
If his fans

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:23.840
react to criticism that way,

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.840
I don't think it's because

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.840
it's going to be a great movie.

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.840
I liked On Golden Pond,

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.840
but I never...

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.840
I let it do its own defending.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.840
I liked Hudson Hawk.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.840
Did you really like

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:41.840
On Golden Pond? I wouldn't think you'd like that.

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:43.840
I thought it was kind of fun.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.840
Nice. Like ordinary people.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.840
I like those 70's movies about...

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.840
I got some movies to show you then.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.840
All right.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.840
What's your favorite movie, Punch Face?

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.840
I forgot your name.

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.840
That's your new name forever.

01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:59.840
I'll take Punch Face.

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.840
Punch Face is the new nickname.

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.840
My name is Russell.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.840
Russell, right?

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.840
Not Russell. Russell.

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.840
What's your favorite movie is a stupid question.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.840
What is a favorite movie of yours?

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.840
Just randomly. It doesn't have to...

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.840
It doesn't have to be like...

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.840
What? I didn't hear.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.840
It's also a bad movie.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.840
Wow.

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.840
Fuck.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.840
You're a good sport with the punch,

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:33.840
but you really overindulge in that wordplay.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.840
That was that.

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.840
I feel assaulted by that.

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.840
Fuck that guy. Sucker Punch.

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.840
Just name a movie you like.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.840
The Hateful Eight was great.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.840
The 70mm Showing was really cool.

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:49.840
I'm sure you saw the Ceramidome.

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.840
Why am I yelling at you?

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.840
You get assaulted on time.

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.840
What?

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.840
What? Are you dumb or something?

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.840
All right.

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:03.840
Thank you for getting Punched in the Face.

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.840
I don't know how long you had.

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.840
I'm pretty sure I've taken up more time than I can.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.840
Leave the ice here.

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.840
We have ice over here.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.840
Is there anything...

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:15.840
I think it's your right, even if it was planned,

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.840
you still earned the right to plug your band

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.840
or anything that you want.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.840
Is there anything you want to let people know you do?

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.840
Yeah, they're in a band together, I think.

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:29.840
I work as Trader Joe's

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.840
and I...

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:33.840
Get the fuck out of here.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.840
I'm so glad I'm not you.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.840
You have a Twitter?

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.840
I'm trying to get the fuck out of this place more or less.

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:41.840
Are you from Miami?

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.840
I'm from Fort Lauderdale.

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.840
More or less South Florida, yes.

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:47.840
Maybe you should head north.

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.840
No, no, no, no.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.840
Don't come our way.

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.840
All right.

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.840
Let's have a hand for Russell

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.840
and let him go ice his face.

01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.840
Thanks, guys.

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.840
All right.

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:03.840
I'd just like to remind the audience

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.840
that you can subscribe to the video version

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.840
of our podcast.

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.840
Oh, my God.

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:11.840
It's going to shoot up so high.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:13.840
$5 a month, everybody.

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.840
Maybe we should plug Anomalisa during this show.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.840
Oh.

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:19.840
Did you ever talk about Anomalisa?

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.840
Oh, it got nominated for an Oscar.

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:23.840
It got nominated for an Oscar for best anime feature.

01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:25.840
Charlie Kaufman's new movie.

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.840
Our studio produced it

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.840
and it almost killed us.

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.840
So please,

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.840
if you want to download it,

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.840
illegally go ahead but buy the DVD

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:37.840
after if you like it.

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:39.840
Yeah, and maybe some of you

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.840
in the audience helped kickstart it early on.

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:43.840
Remember when that guy got punched in the face?

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.840
No.

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.840
That meaty sound.

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.840
That was a good

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:51.840
sound.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.840
It was definitely a real punch.

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.840
Yeah.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.840
It knocked him out of his chair.

01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.840
That sound,

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.840
I remember my brother getting in

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:03.840
fights and

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:05.840
that slapy beef sound.

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.840
Yeah, it's not like the movies.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.840
No, it's a chair.

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:11.840
It's like a real

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.840
horrible thing.

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.840
Yeah.

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:17.840
I'm just glad it was him and not us.

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.840
Yeah, I totally thought

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:21.840
that we'd be stabbed at this show.

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:23.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:25.840
That's why, yeah, I'm pleasantly surprised.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:27.840
Jesus Christ.

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.840
God damn it.

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.840
Scared the shit out of me.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.840
We all have fucking PTSD now.

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:37.840
I got the living

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.840
crap eating out of me when I was 17.

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:41.840
I will say

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.840
I deserved it. Nobody deserves to be physically hurt,

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.840
but I put myself

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.840
in a situation where I shouldn't have shocked me

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.840
that I ended up in a

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.840
lot of trouble.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.840
I went and partied with a bunch of

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.840
just random dudes.

01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.840
In my hometown

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.840
of Brown Deer, Wisconsin, there was only

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:03.840
if you were underage,

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.840
you couldn't buy liquor at the liquor stores.

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.840
It was too small a town.

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.840
This local motel.

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.840
And we'd

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.840
see if anybody wanted to

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:15.840
pitch in a bunch of money and find somebody

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:17.840
who was 21 and go buy beer.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.840
I went with a couple of friends and was cruising

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.840
the motel and there was a bunch of dudes

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:23.840
and we started drinking malt liquor together

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:25.840
and smoking weed and we all pooled our money.

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.840
So we all knew we were all broke.

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:29.840
And then we just got really, really high

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.840
and really, really drunk and then

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.840
that's the horrible thing about violence is

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.840
it's inexplicable and it's like

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.840
there's no sense and it just

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.840
flavors your world for the rest of your life

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.840
because you're like, what the fuck was that?

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:43.840
I just remember sitting and being

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.840
really high and really drunk and there's this

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.840
rap music playing and I'm just nodding.

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.840
I'm like, I'm so high and I got a yin-yang patch

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.840
on my frosted denim jacket and I got

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.840
a little rat tail

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.840
with rubber bands and a little

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.840
E-gun from the real Ghostbusters rat tail.

01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.840
And then

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.840
all of a sudden one of my two

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.840
friends, I see him stand up

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.840
and there's one of the stranger guys

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:07.840
they had us way outnumbered.

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.840
He was talking to him and my friend started shaking

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.840
his head and I didn't know what was going on

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.840
because the music was so loud and then all of a sudden

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.840
these fists just start flying.

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:17.840
The guy was just beating up my friend.

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.840
It wasn't like they got in a fight.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.840
It was like the guy just started assaulting him

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:23.840
and then I stood up and then it was

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.840
just like 10 dudes

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.840
just like it felt like they were trying

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.840
to murder me. I didn't feel like

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.840
they were ever going to stop and I remember

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.840
my wallet. I was like kneeling on the floor

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.840
and I held out my wallet which I knew was empty

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:37.840
and which they knew was empty and then I felt

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:39.840
the wallet leave my hand and

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.840
there was a pause and then I felt

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.840
more punches

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.840
in the back of my head and I thought

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:47.840
oh my god they're going to kill me because

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.840
there's no reason for this. They're just

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.840
so high and drunk they just want to fucking kill me.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.840
There was like glasses

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.840
breaking over my head. My head

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.840
was going into mirrors and stuff. A mirror.

01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.840
I pluralized it to sound like a badass.

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.840
You were in a house of mirrors.

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:03.840
I probably told this story in the podcast before.

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:05.840
I was like, I was a kid who like

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:07.840
tossed around the room and at one point

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:09.840
one guy in the corner from

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:11.840
their crew like grabbed me

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:13.840
that was standing by the door and

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:15.840
he just grabbed me by the shoulders and looked

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.840
at my eyes and said get out of here

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:19.840
and shoved me out the door and slammed

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.840
it behind me and locked it.

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:23.840
Like I wanted to get back in.

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.840
I'm ashamed to say I forgot about my friends.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.840
I didn't know if they were gone

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:31.840
because I was so...

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:33.840
I didn't remember if they were still

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.840
in there but I just want to be

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:37.840
candid and say I didn't

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:39.840
think about them anymore.

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:41.840
My face was so

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.840
fucked up. It was rapidly like

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:45.840
the swelling starts to happen a little bit later.

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:47.840
Everything was getting blurry.

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:49.840
The last thing I saw clearly before everything

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.840
just became blobs of light

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.840
was a young lady coming out of

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.840
an adjacent motel room

01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:57.840
and this was

01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:59.840
the worst part of it all was that

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:01.840
she came out of the room

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:03.840
and she looked at me

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:05.840
and I just expected like well I've been the victim

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:07.840
of a violent crime and now here's

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.840
where somebody will express

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:11.840
concern because

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.840
whatever she saw

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.840
which is the only mirror

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.840
available to me and my face had gone through

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.840
so I didn't know what she...

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.840
she looked at me and she

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:23.840
screamed like

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.840
she was terrified of me

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:27.840
that's how fucked up my face looked

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.840
like she was just like watching

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:31.840
and she ran back into her room

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.840
and just like closed the door

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.840
and then I just like walked and I tumbled

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:37.840
down a hill onto a freeway

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.840
and I stood up and I

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.840
tried to walk home but I couldn't see

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.840
I just like walked... I was just following

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:45.840
like these lights because I couldn't see anything

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.840
Why did I bring that up?

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.840
Because that sound, that fucking meaty slap

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:51.840
I got...

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:53.840
in high school

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.840
I got beat up once

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.840
it was supposed to be a fight

01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:59.840
but it wasn't

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.840
I didn't throw a punch because

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.840
I just didn't know

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:05.840
it seemed weird to punch someone

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.840
back in high school

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:09.840
now

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.840
but I remember I just got like

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.840
the shit beat out of me and just like

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:15.840
like black eye and blood

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:17.840
and I remember the guy

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.840
and he's my Facebook friend now

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.840
and then

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.840
I posted

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:25.840
this bit that I do with Andy Dick

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:27.840
where he beats the shit out of me

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.840
as a bit

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.840
and I posted it once a year because it hurts

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.840
so I feel like I should at least get credit

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.840
for getting punched in the face

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:37.840
and slapped really hard

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.840
and

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.840
one of the comments

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.840
was that guy's brother

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:45.840
who just

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.840
wrote his brother's name

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:49.840
and it was highlighted

01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:51.840
like you gotta take a look at this

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.840
like

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.840
the guy that you fucking beat up

01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:57.840
is now on YouTube getting beat up

01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:59.840
I don't know

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.840
or do you think I'm just like reading into something?

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.840
No, no, I don't at all

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:05.840
How did that make you feel?

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:07.840
Horrible

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:09.840
This guy is still talking about

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:11.840
beating the shit out of me when I was 13

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.840
and also made me feel good

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.840
you know, I mean

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.840
he's got no life

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.840
that's a high point in his life

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:23.840
He peaked, you're bummed

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:25.840
because you don't want to be his peak

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:27.840
Yeah, exactly

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:29.840
He jacks off about it

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.840
If he won a high contest after that

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:33.840
and that was his peak, then he could really mock him

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.840
Alright, well

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.840
moving on from that topic

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:39.840
What

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:41.840
you're apologizing for

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:43.840
Don't worry about it, Russell

01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.840
The jury's still out on Russell

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:49.840
Russell, wait

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.840
it's a strange relationship

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.840
I mean, that's fine

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.840
No apology necessary, that's for sure

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:01.840
Alright, let's

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:03.840
kick this thing into high gear

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.840
Oh, really now?

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:07.840
How much time do we have left?

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.840
Ten minutes? Who said ten minutes?

01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:13.840
It's just some guy that just

01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:15.840
20 minutes is pretty close

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:17.840
10 or 15

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:21.840
Should we do a lightning round?

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:23.840
Should we do a little role-playing?

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:25.840
You know

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:27.840
I guess we should

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.840
Did you bring your

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:31.840
I'm going to try and play along this time

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.840
Okay, you're going to be nice this time

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:35.840
It's because I'm afraid of it

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:37.840
That's why

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:39.840
We have a waving hand, what's up

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:41.840
I want to play

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.840
You want to play?

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:45.840
You sounded bored

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:47.840
Come on up

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:49.840
Let's

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:51.840
balance that out and make sure that we continue

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.840
to think of gender as a dichotomy

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.840
Okay, come on up

01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.840
Birthdays don't count

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:01.840
here

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.840
It's my birthday, I know it cares

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.840
because it's too close to Christmas

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:07.840
He's used to not having his birthday

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:09.840
celebrated

01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:11.840
January birthdays

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:17.840
All right, what are your names here?

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.840
I'm Caitlin

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:21.840
And I'm William

01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:23.840
This is Spencer

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:25.840
My name is Dan Harmon

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:27.840
That's Dino

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:29.840
That's probably to record

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:31.840
the sound of them charging the audience

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.840
charging the stage

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.840
Nobody punch me, okay

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:37.840
I think we're getting you another mic

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.840
All right, so

01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:41.840
That mic is bad

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.840
I'm going to be really bad at this

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:45.840
You guys take the mic

01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:55.840
Okay, so we got

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:57.840
Demorige's character

01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:59.840
What's that? Oh, that's the order

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:01.840
Which of you would like to play

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.840
Demorige's character, Hortigrad

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.840
Thank you, you knew the name

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:07.840
All right, you're playing Hortigrad

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:09.840
And Jeff Davis's character, Mercy

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.840
I'll take that one, please

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:13.840
You want to play Jeff's character? Okay

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:15.840
That's Eve Liberty

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.840
Yeah, Eve, Mercy's dead

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:19.840
Here, you play

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:21.840
Spoiler alert

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:23.840
And you can play Camille's

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:25.840
usual character

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.840
Doctor Friend, I believe that is

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.840
All right, oh, and then

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:31.840
I might have myself

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:33.840
a guitar

01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:35.840
All right, so

01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:37.840
So

01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:39.840
I mean, you don't got to

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.840
try to understand it

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:43.840
It doesn't make sense

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.840
Yeah, I don't, I mean

01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:47.840
I never really look at this

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.840
Yeah, it's fine, it's all fine

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:51.840
I mean, I look at it, but

01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.840
All right

01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:55.840
Dusty, we got music or no?

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.840
Okay, cool

01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:59.840
I'm just going to go then

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.840
This one's by Michael Bricks

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.840
A lot of people wrote recaps and they were very good

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.840
but a lot of them were too long, sorry

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.840
Okay, so yeah

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.840
Last time

01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:11.840
on Harmon Run, the gang

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:13.840
made their way to press 5 to refresh

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:15.840
in search of Jim

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.840
Peggy's daughter, in an attempt

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:19.840
to complete their mission, all but

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.840
Hortigrad disguised themselves as

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.840
southern bells to sneak their way

01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.840
into the building, they got

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:27.840
to the lobby, but in an unlikely

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:29.840
array of events, Jim

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:31.840
drew impatient of Rob Schrab

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.840
and shot the security guard in the head

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.840
That's right

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:37.840
After debating whether or not

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.840
they should heal the dead man, a smoke

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.840
grenade flew into the room and

01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:43.840
gunfire started a blazing

01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:45.840
through, poorly trying

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.840
to escape through an air vent

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:49.840
Rob Schrab runs towards the security guards

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:51.840
Oh, I guess that's

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:53.840
Mercy O'Donnell, Mercy O'Donnell

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:55.840
runs towards the security guards

01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:57.840
and is obliterated into a pink

01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.840
mist by machine gun

01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:01.840
fire. Is this the end

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:03.840
of our shadow runners?

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:05.840
Will they meet the same fate as Mercy O'Donnell?

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:07.840
And who was Rob Schrab

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:09.840
playing as I answered that question?

01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:11.840
Find out this time

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.840
on Shadow Town, Harmon Run

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:15.840
Town

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:19.840
Alright

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.840
Alright, do you guys have

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:23.840
any questions? Let me set the stage

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.840
for you. You're in the lobby

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.840
of the press f5 to

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:29.840
refresh. There are security guards

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:31.840
peppering the area with machine gun

01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:33.840
fire. Everyone is clambering

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:35.840
into an air vent except

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.840
for Jim Nightblade who's just finishing

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:39.840
his climbing. You're all in this air vent

01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:41.840
that's being

01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:43.840
the air vents above a room that's just being coated

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.840
in gunfire. You hear screams

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.840
and just explosions and all sorts

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:49.840
of stuff and you realize the air vent

01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:51.840
you're in isn't exactly bullet proof

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:53.840
but is the air conditioning on?

01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:55.840
Yes, it's lovely.

01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:57.840
Guys, I

01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:59.840
see here I'm good at sneaking

01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:01.840
so

01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:03.840
can I suggest

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.840
not being loud in this air vent?

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:07.840
Okay

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:09.840
How many points do I get for that?

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:11.840
Three. Thank you.

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.840
I think they might know that we

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:15.840
I'm going to blow you out of the water!

01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:17.840
Just keep moving.

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:19.840
So we're all single file in an air vent?

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.840
Yeah, you're kind of in the back.

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:23.840
Go! Go!

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:25.840
I think they know we're in here.

01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:27.840
What do I say about quiet?

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.840
Don't talk just mine.

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.840
If we could be both quiet and fast

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:33.840
good but if one has to cost the other

01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:35.840
I'd go for speed because bullets

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:37.840
are so fast.

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:41.840
But I'm good at medicine

01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:43.840
so I can heal you.

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:45.840
Who's in front?

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.840
Let's say Mercy. No, she's dead.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.840
Let's put

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:51.840
Horde Guard out front.

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:53.840
Does that mean? Nope.

01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:55.840
I'll lead the way.

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.840
I move very quickly.

01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:59.840
That's true.

01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.840
You crawl down the vent as

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:03.840
bullet holes rip through the air vent.

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.840
Don't worry, I'm good at medicine.

01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.840
I dodge them.

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.840
I use my cat-like agility to

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.840
sneak around those bullets.

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.840
You do that. You sneak right around the bullets.

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:15.840
Whoa!

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.840
You guys crawl to a T-junction

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:19.840
in the air vent. It seems to be

01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.840
past the room you were just in

01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:23.840
so you bought yourselves a little bit of time.

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.840
Left.

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:29.840
Is that it?

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:31.840
Does it seem like a correct

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:33.840
direction? They all seem great.

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:35.840
Left.

01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:37.840
Yeah, you turn left.

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:39.840
You shuffle down.

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:41.840
I follow for my money.

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.840
You shuffle down. Below you

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.840
you see a great, but also

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.840
the thing goes ahead. It's still

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.840
being adduct that way.

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.840
But there's a great below you.

01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:53.840
Great geography.

01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:55.840
Jump down through it.

01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:57.840
All right.

01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.840
Wait.

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.840
I look through it first.

01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:03.840
You see a bunch of cowering

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.840
people.

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.840
They're wearing medical gowns

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.840
and they're cowering as if

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:11.840
evading or trying to dodge

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:13.840
some sort of shooting.

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:15.840
Is there anyone

01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:17.840
shooting at them? No, but

01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.840
you do hear gunshots coming from other rooms.

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:21.840
Like the ones you were just near.

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.840
So I kick my way through it

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.840
and take a defensive

01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.840
position.

01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:29.840
All right. Who else is doing stuff?

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:31.840
I shoot like five

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.840
people.

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:35.840
Who else is doing stuff?

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:37.840
Because I'm good at shooting.

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.840
It's true. He's great.

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:41.840
You're watching.

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.840
I

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:45.840
drop down.

01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:47.840
Do you want to

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.840
figure out the result of him shooting five people?

01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.840
It's all going to happen kind of simultaneously.

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.840
My next move would be

01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:57.840
to go down into the room that he went down into.

01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:59.840
All right.

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.840
I didn't catch your name.

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:03.840
Dan Harmon. No.

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.840
William.

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:07.840
Caitlin.

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.840
What do you want to do?

01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:11.840
I'm going to follow behind them still

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:13.840
being Catholic. All right.

01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:15.840
The three of you leap into the room.

01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.840
It shocks all the people and they start backing

01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:19.840
away from you.

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:21.840
But as they back away, five of them are cut down

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:23.840
by pistol fire coming from the vent above.

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:25.840
Me, right? Yeah.

01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:27.840
Jesus Christ.

01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:29.840
All right.

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.840
Get their medical gowns.

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:33.840
They'll never suspect.

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:35.840
Five

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.840
doctors with blood all over them.

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.840
I stripped the dead ones.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.840
What? I stripped the dead ones.

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:43.840
The rest of them

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:45.840
are screaming and cowering in a corner.

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.840
Give me

01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:49.840
your medical gowns.

01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:53.840
People got shot even

01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:55.840
before I asked that.

01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:57.840
I jumped down and

01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:59.840
applied medicine to the shot people

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.840
and get them to be on our side.

01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:03.840
Well, they're dead. The shot people are dead.

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:05.840
No, I'm really good at medicine.

01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:07.840
But you're even...

01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:09.840
You're better at shooting, though. Well, that's not true.

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:11.840
But you were good enough at shooting

01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:13.840
so that the goodness of medicine

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:15.840
isn't applicable in this situation.

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:17.840
You're the

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:19.840
dragon lord.

01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:21.840
Grand mask, no. Grand dragon.

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:23.840
Yeah.

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:25.840
Well, I have somebody...

01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.840
Give me your gowns.

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.840
You got everybody's gowns.

01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:31.840
All right. I put these on.

01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:33.840
We're disguised as doctors.

01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.840
It's the best plan in the world.

01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:37.840
Medical gowns are not worn by doctors.

01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:39.840
Patience. Patience.

01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:41.840
That's even better.

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.840
Am I still in the grading up there?

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:45.840
Yeah, yeah. You're still up there.

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.840
Hey! Guys!

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:49.840
Yeah?

01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:51.840
I'm really good with...

01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:55.840
clubs.

01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:57.840
I was in the chess club

01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.840
in school.

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:01.840
I could move

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.840
like the way a knight moves.

01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:05.840
Like an L? Like straight

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.840
and then to the side? Is that a knight?

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:09.840
Oh, shit. I'm thinking bishop.

01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:11.840
Yeah.

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:13.840
No wonder I got kicked out of that club.

01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.840
Yeah.

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.840
Why don't you do what a pawn would do

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.840
and just come down one

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.840
space? Fuck you.

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.840
Do what a pawn would do. You're an asshole.

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:25.840
Sorry.

01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.840
I think you're a queen.

01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:29.840
You I like.

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:31.840
What do you want?

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:33.840
Queens could do anything.

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:35.840
Queens could do what pawns do.

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.840
Right? Or is that a king?

01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.840
I'm putting on a gown.

01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:41.840
Do I have a gown on?

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:43.840
I'm leaving.

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:45.840
Do you take off all your tactical gear

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:47.840
or do you disarm yourself?

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:49.840
It's a gown. It kind of like drapes over the gear.

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.840
It's very thin and

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:53.840
also open.

01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:55.840
Now, realism?

01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:57.840
All right.

01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:59.840
Okay.

01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:01.840
I just want to get at the lay of the land.

01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:03.840
Yes, I take off all of my tactical gear

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:05.840
and I do it. I'm a desperate man.

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.840
I'm terrified. This mission has gone

01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:09.840
parachaped

01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:11.840
since about a year and a half ago.

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.840
And I

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:15.840
now if I could just in my head

01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:17.840
what I'm thinking just so you know is

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:19.840
if I have to

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:21.840
get naked, put on a medical gown

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:23.840
and wander off into Seattle

01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:25.840
and just never shadow run again

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.840
right now I'm thinking

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:29.840
the good idea because

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:31.840
I feel bad.

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:33.840
I got an idea.

01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:37.840
Let's play dead.

01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:39.840
I have this cyanide.

01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:41.840
We all take the cyanide and play dead.

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.840
We all have cyanide immunity, right?

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.840
We have cyanide community?

01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:49.840
I do. Do you guys have cyanide immunity?

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:51.840
No.

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:53.840
New plan, new plan.

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:55.840
Someone else come up with something.

01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.840
If you take your cyanide, I can quick heal you.

01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.840
Yes.

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And where does that get us?

01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:03.840
Nowhere.

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.840
You lose cyanide.

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:07.840
Yeah, because I'm immune to it anyway.

01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:09.840
All right, go ahead, go ahead.

01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:11.840
Oh, immunity.

01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:13.840
I'm putting I'm getting naked

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.840
and putting on this gown.

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:17.840
And then I'm leaving.

01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:19.840
I'll follow you.

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:21.840
Okay.

01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:23.840
Can you get naked and put on a gown?

01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:25.840
Yeah.

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:27.840
Yeah, I love it.

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:29.840
Here we go.

01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:31.840
Are you still up in the vent?

01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:33.840
Get a load of this.

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.840
Yeah.

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:37.840
You've just been this voice from a vent this whole time.

01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:39.840
I like you to see me

01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.840
in little squares.

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.840
Naked.

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:45.840
Here I am. Okay, I'm out of the vent

01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:47.840
and I'm all dressed.

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.840
All of you are wearing medical gowns.

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:51.840
Are we still being attacked?

01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:53.840
No, you're in another room.

01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:55.840
Okay.

01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:57.840
I'll

01:43:57.840 --> 01:43:59.840
I strap a

01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:01.840
a grappling hook

01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:03.840
to my arm under the sleeve

01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:05.840
and two guns to my back.

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:09.840
Like a diehard.

01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:11.840
Like a double diehard.

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:13.840
With a side of grappling hook.

01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:15.840
I'm going to die harder

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:17.840
and then I'll wear the gown

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:19.840
and stuff my clothes into the vent.

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:21.840
All right.

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:23.840
You hear an explosion coming from the hallway.

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:25.840
You see a metal door fly

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:27.840
going face down

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.840
and you hear the voices of tactical people

01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:31.840
going clear the hall.

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:33.840
Get every room. Get them all.

01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:35.840
Find all the peeps.

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.840
It's future slang.

01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:39.840
Caitlin, whoever you're playing.

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.840
Who are you playing?

01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:43.840
Eve.

01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:45.840
Get naked.

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.840
Oh, yes. I stripped down.

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:49.840
I put on my medical gown

01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:51.840
and then I want to use my improved invisibility

01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:53.840
so these people that are charging in this room

01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:55.840
are about to find me.

01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:57.840
Just so you know, now I feel bad that I told you to get naked

01:44:57.840 --> 01:44:59.840
if you have invisibility.

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.840
And I feel like I should mention

01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:03.840
that improved invisibility can work on multiple targets.

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:05.840
All right.

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.840
Well, I cast my improved

01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:09.840
invisibility on all of us.

01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:13.840
Jesus Christ, I put my tactical gear back on.

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.840
Except now it's hard

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:17.840
because I can't see my own hands.

01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:19.840
So it's kind of like

01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:21.840
it's like when you have novocaine

01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:23.840
in your jaw and you're trying to suck through a straw.

01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:25.840
I put my hospital gun on backwards.

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:27.840
All right.

01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:29.840
So, okay.

01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:31.840
You're all invisible.

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:33.840
Do you have a course of action

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.840
or do you think being invisible is good?

01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:37.840
Well, I mean, let's be honest.

01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.840
Being invisible is great.

01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:41.840
Yeah, this is enough.

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:43.840
It solves a ton of problems.

01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:45.840
All right.

01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:47.840
The tactical guardsmen, they rush into the room

01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.840
and they go, where are they?

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:51.840
Get on the ground.

01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:53.840
You see all the people get on the ground

01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:55.840
and they start crying.

01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:57.840
And two of the guardsmen stay watching

01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:59.840
and the rest of them run down the hall

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:01.840
to clear other rooms.

01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:03.840
I silently walk out.

01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:05.840
Okay.

01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:07.840
So, sorry.

01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:09.840
A bird just flew into my head.

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:11.840
We're indoors.

01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:13.840
It was a parakeet.

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:19.840
I hate being invisible.

01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:23.840
Shit.

01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:25.840
I attack the,

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:27.840
I stun baton the

01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:29.840
guards that are in here,

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:31.840
the tactical guys

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:33.840
because they hear us talking now, right?

01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:35.840
Yeah, yeah, no, they do.

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:37.840
Am I going to turn invisible?

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:39.840
Is this like D&D rules?

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:41.840
Do I turn invisible when I attack?

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:43.840
I can't remember.

01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:45.840
Let's say yes.

01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.840
Okay. Well, then I don't attack.

01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:49.840
Can I make walls?

01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:51.840
I'm the wall maker.

01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:53.840
I don't think horticard can make walls.

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:55.840
Like any human being can make walls.

01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:57.840
I stand corrected.

01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:59.840
Yeah, Dr. Frank can make barriers.

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:01.840
I think Eve can make barriers.

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:03.840
There's also anxiety when I talk to people

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:05.840
and I can't explain the original plan.

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:07.840
Yeah, I can make barriers.

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:09.840
There's a second page here.

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.840
Well, am I going to,

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:13.840
that'll make me not invisible anymore.

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:15.840
That's true.

01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:17.840
Yeah, I'm leaving.

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:19.840
All right. Do you want to tell anyone that?

01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:21.840
Can I do it through my comlinks?

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:23.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:25.840
Well, you have, yeah, I mean, there's these,

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:27.840
there's the short answers, yes.

01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:29.840
I'm leaving.

01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:31.840
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.

01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:33.840
I'm leaving.

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:35.840
Fucking parakeet.

01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:37.840
All right.

01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:39.840
Silently and invisibly,

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:41.840
you walk out the front door.

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:43.840
Of the whole place?

01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:45.840
Yeah.

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:47.840
We're out in the streets? Yeah, man.

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:49.840
All right, guys, we did it.

01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:51.840
You did. We made it out alive.

01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:53.840
Not tired.

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:55.840
All right.

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.840
I feel good.

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.840
You really didn't die.

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:05.840
Guys, how can we see anything?

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:07.840
Because you need,

01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:09.840
when you're invisible, you need to focus

01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:11.840
on your retina.

01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:13.840
And like, how do you focus?

01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:15.840
The light is going through your

01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.840
ocular apparatus.

01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:19.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:21.840
It's a good question.

01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:23.840
We should go to the library.

01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:25.840
Let's go to the library.

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:27.840
We go to the library.

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.840
Okay.

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:31.840
Maybe we weren't really invisible.

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:33.840
No, you are.

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:35.840
Maybe it's impossible. We're going to the library.

01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:37.840
Why do you hate libraries?

01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:39.840
Learn a few things.

01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.840
You're literate, aren't you?

01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:43.840
I don't have your sheet, but I think you're literate.

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:45.840
I've got a map.

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.840
He's got it.

01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:49.840
All right, you're at the library.

01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:51.840
Okay, I take all the books out.

01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.840
There are no books.

01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:55.840
Oh, shit. It's the future.

01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:01.840
Do they have MP3s?

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:03.840
Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:05.840
Can you order DVDs?

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:07.840
Is that what he says?

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:09.840
No.

01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:11.840
Really, he wasn't thinking the same thing I was?

01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:13.840
I research invisibility.

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:15.840
Okay, you find out that magic is why.

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:17.840
It's magic.

01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:21.840
No, that explains everything.

01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.840
You can't see me yet?

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:25.840
No.

01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:27.840
Well, I'm leaving the library.

01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:29.840
Were you talking to me?

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.840
Yeah, I'm looking right at you.

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:33.840
I can't see that.

01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:35.840
I don't even know I'm looking at you.

01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:37.840
You fuck with me all the time.

01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:39.840
I'm leaving.

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:41.840
I'm out in the street.

01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:43.840
Spencer trying to figure this out.

01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:45.840
It's not my job to figure this out at all.

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:47.840
No, I mean, you just walked out of the mission.

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:49.840
What do you want to do now?

01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:51.840
It turns out that you...

01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:53.840
Are you mad at us?

01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:55.840
No, I mean, I knew this was going to happen.

01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:57.840
All right, we failed.

01:49:57.840 --> 01:49:59.840
We failed. We're bad shadow runners.

01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:01.840
My wife, my ex-wife's character

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.840
got blown away in a mist.

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:05.840
And she's going to think

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:07.840
that I put Spencer up to that.

01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:09.840
No, that was wrong.

01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:11.840
All right, well,

01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:13.840
we all jump up in the air,

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:15.840
so we can't see each other.

01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:17.840
But in the...

01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:19.840
Bad high fives, right?

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:21.840
Yeah.

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.840
It's like a freeze frame,

01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:25.840
like in a Toyota commercial from the 80s.

01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:27.840
But we don't know it.

01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:29.840
We just all describe it.

01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:31.840
I'm up in the air.

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:33.840
Me too.

01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:35.840
All right, thank you.

01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:37.840
Thank you, Magic Kingdom.

01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:41.840
Good.

01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:43.840
Spencer Crittenden, your game master.

01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:47.840
Russell, your...

01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.840
Russell got the shit beat out of him!

01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:55.840
We were scared for a second.

01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:57.840
I say he got beaten up.

01:50:57.840 --> 01:50:59.840
I think he got it. He took a punch like a man.

01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:01.840
Or a strong woman.

01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:05.840
He took a punch with agency.

01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:07.840
Let's have a hand for our roleplayers.

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:09.840
Let's have a hand for

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.840
Graciella.

01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:13.840
Thank you, Rick.

01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:15.840
Rick, the amazing buddy's mom.

01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:17.840
Fucker.

01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:19.840
Justin Marshall.

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:21.840
Steve Levy.

01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:23.840
Tito Stamatopoulos.

01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.840
I will give you

01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.840
a million dollars

01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:29.840
if you don't expect me

01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:31.840
to take pictures.

01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:33.840
We're doing a signing tomorrow.

01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:35.840
Right?

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:37.840
So, please come to the booth

01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:39.840
for that.

01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:41.840
My throat is shredded.

01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:43.840
I watched a man get punched in the face

01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:45.840
and didn't do anything about it.

01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:47.840
I'm really going to go home

01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:49.840
and make love to my girlfriend

01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:51.840
with a lot of vigor.

01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:53.840
I'm sure she was very impressed

01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:55.840
by my instinctive

01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:57.840
skills.

01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:59.840
I just went, what?

01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:01.840
Security!

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:03.840
Security!

01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:05.840
Thank you so much,

01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:07.840
Miami and its visitors.

01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:09.840
Come see me tomorrow.

01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:11.840
I'll sign anything. Take pictures with you.

01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:13.840
God bless you. Have a great convention.

01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:15.840
So sorry to anyone that was traumatized.

01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:17.840
You're all fantastic.

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.840
Did you get any of that?

01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:31.840
It's a good show.
