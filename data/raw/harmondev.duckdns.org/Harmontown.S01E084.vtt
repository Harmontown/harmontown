was.\n\n00:37.000 --> 00:39.000\nWe've been to Scotland and Dan was in Ireland,\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:41.000\nbut we're back now with my favorite words.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:44.000\nI get to say one more time, for the first time in 2014,\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:46.000\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:49.000\nMusic plays\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:53.000\nPlease welcome to the stage the Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:59.000\nApplause\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:01.000\nThank you very much.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:05.000\nApplause\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:08.000\nThank you for showing up in such numbers.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:10.000\nI didn't even tweet it.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:12.000\nThis is a big event.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:14.000\nYou know, Harmontown live audience members,\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:16.000\nand not the listeners, I'm just saying,\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:18.000\nthe people that show up for the live show,\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:20.000\nthey're very fair weather friends.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:23.000\nLike, they do, they're like,\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:26.000\noh, the show's good again, let's go.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:30.000\nApplause\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:33.000\nYou remember when I got hired back, they showed up.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:37.000\nRight, I mean, I'm less cynical than you maybe.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:39.000\nI thought this was just because we've been gone for a while.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:42.000\nThis was our triumphant return from the United Kingdom.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:44.000\nAlright, maybe they're good people.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:48.000\nOr, I mean, let's be honest everybody,\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:50.000\nmaybe by a very honest show of applause,\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:53.000\nwho's here simply because community is back up with Dan Harmon?\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:55.000\nYeah, alright, fine.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:58.000\nOkay, three very honest people and 30 liars.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:02.000\nYeah, I mean, it wouldn't really make sense for that to be the motivation.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:06.000\nSo, you can probably hear from my voice\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:08.000\nthat I'm a little under the weather,\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:13.000\nI caught some kind of Scottish Ebola in Scotland of all places.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:19.000\nEdinburgh, who was wonderful,\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:24.000\ncouldn't ask for a more beautiful, welcoming city full of joy and delight,\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:28.000\nbut two guys high-fived my rental kilt,\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:33.000\nand one of them gave me fucking barbarian herpes.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:39.000\nThis is some old school bubonic, old world microbial fucking...\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:43.000\nYou got sick like the New Year's Day, I think, right?\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:45.000\nYeah, I was like right after Hogmanie,\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:47.000\nwhich is what they call their New Year's celebration in Edinburgh,\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:50.000\nand I kept to myself that night.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:54.000\nI didn't even, I had two glasses of cider because my rental shoes were,\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nthat was the only mistake I made that night.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:00.000\nI couldn't walk around on these fucking wingtips that I got from the kilt rental place.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:04.000\nI should have realized that Scottish people aren't going to wear,\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:07.000\nthey're not going to dress fancy for Hogmanie.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:11.000\nThey'll put their kilt on so that their balls can be cooled\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:16.000\nin the nice night air because it's fun to wear a kilt.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:19.000\nBut they put on their Doc Martens and their Converse and stuff,\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:24.000\nand they run around the cobblestone streets like pigs.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:27.000\nWow, wonderful pigs.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:29.000\nI'm not saying they're pigs.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:32.000\nI wore my own brogues that night, I brought my own shoes.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:36.000\nTo me, renting shoes is like, that's why I don't bowl.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:38.000\nThat's fucking, that's no good.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:42.000\nSo anyways, the truth is, and I say this without shame,\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:49.000\nthat's not true, but I spent at least 35 minutes of that New Year's Eve on the toilet.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:53.000\nLike I just sat on the toilet in the stall because it's where I could sit down.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:55.000\nBecause my shoes hurt so bad.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:57.000\nI was just a sad little wallflower.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:02.000\nI played my farm game on my phone and everyone in the other room was like,\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:08.000\nyeah, it was a room full of Popeyes.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:13.000\nAnd I touched two people that night that weren't airing.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:17.000\nAlso, you were walking around in a pretty chilly Scotland in a kilt.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nI don't think that's where illness comes from.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:20.000\nIt comes from other people.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:24.000\nI don't think it's not, illness doesn't come from cold.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.000\nI was very gregarious and slapped a lot of fives that night.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:28.000\nI didn't get any cold.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:33.000\nThere was one guy I remember, I remember him walking by me and he went,\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:34.000\nrespect!\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:37.000\nAnd high five on the way home.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:44.000\nAnd that high five, I think some fucking purple monster leapt from his hand to mine\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:48.000\nand then jumped into my mouth and laid eggs in my chest.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:49.000\nJaren is at home right now.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nShe's not here.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:56.000\nYou don't think that she wanted to come here and talk about the events of the New Year's Eve.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:59.000\nShe wanted to come here and talk about the events of the holiday.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:01.000\nThat's how bad this fucker is.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:03.000\nShe's sick, too.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:08.000\nDon't applaud Aaron being sick, you assholes.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nThat's very rude.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:13.000\nOh, you mean the new news?\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:14.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:27.000\nI proposed marriage to Erin McGathy and...\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nPressure's off now, man, today.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:34.000\nI was just machine gun farting in bed, like...\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:37.000\nBecause every time I cough, I fart, too.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:40.000\nWait, but are you saying...\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:42.000\nI'm not doing it on purpose.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nI also tip from my...\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:47.000\nBecause the cough is loud in my head, so I feel like I got away with it.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nAnd then I look over and she's like, what the fuck?\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:50.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:53.000\nAnd then you hold that and you point to her ring and you just keep farting?\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:54.000\nYeah.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:58.000\nAre you saying up until the engagement, you've been...\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nYou've issued some restraint in that...\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nA couple slipped out.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nNo, you guys talk about farting all over each other, don't you?\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nLike, isn't that a thing?\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:10.000\nI have farted before, but every time I have, what I've thought is...\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.000\nA bit of merrier.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:15.000\nSo romantic.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:16.000\nSo romantic.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:17.000\nVery romantic.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nThat's what love is.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:23.000\nNow, to take the crowd, if you would, Dan, take us through the...\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:24.000\nNow, we get to Scotland.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nI thought...\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nI did not know for certain that you were going to propose.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nI figured you were.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nI felt like that was in the ether.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:36.000\nKate, my girlfriend, she had talked to you about it.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nShe knew, but she didn't tell me.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:42.000\nWell, when Kate and I landed in Scotland, we took different planes,\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nbut we landed in Scotland within minutes of each other.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nYou guys had just gotten there.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:49.000\nAnd we landed, and take us through...\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:52.000\nFrom the beginning of the Scotland...\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:54.000\nWell, as everyone knows, I'm a big planner.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.000\nLike, that's my wheelhouse.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:59.000\nAs the show can testify to.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:02.000\nThey call me Mr. Forsyte.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:08.000\nThey call me Schedule Steve.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:13.000\nDan stayed up all night thinking of that character now.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:17.000\nSchedule Steve.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nI love that you're a writer.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:22.000\nSo, I thought, let's embrace that idea.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:26.000\nTo marry me is to marry organic chaos.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:28.000\nNot, you know...\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:29.000\nSchedule Steve.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nNot an Excel spreadsheet, you know?\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nYeah, not Schedule Steve.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nDon't truck Dan.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nThat's your Marian.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:39.000\nAnd I thought, you know what?\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nYou know what's going to turn out is...\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nIt's going to be romantic.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nBecause, you know, it's not romantic.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nIt's stress, and anxiety, and planning, and being outside the moment.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nShoot from the hip, baby.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:52.000\nAnd, you know, we're going to be having a great time,\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nand I'll just have this ring on me the whole...\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nAll the time, and that way, right at the moment.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:59.000\nThis is an idea I got from Jim on the office.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:04.000\nAt the right moment, I will bust it out.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nIt'll be perfect.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:07.000\nSo, I have this...\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nNow, stop. I'm going to pause you there.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nBecause this is a question I don't actually know.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:14.000\nDid you think in your head there would be a certain day\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:15.000\nbefore Christmas?\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nWe left on the 21st.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:18.000\nDid you...\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:19.000\nLanding on the 22nd.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nDid you think it would be pre-Christmas,\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:21.000\nmaybe over-Christmas, maybe...\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:22.000\nNo, I didn't think about it.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:23.000\nOkay.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nAll right.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nNo preconceived notions of what day,\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nor what would be too late, or too early, or too anything.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:30.000\nNo.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:31.000\nI mean, I didn't want...\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:32.000\nI probably didn't want to wait until the last day,\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nbut I also knew that whatever.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.000\nOkay, gotcha.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:36.000\nAll right.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:40.000\nI got my Kettle One Alliance backpack.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:41.000\nRight.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:45.000\nKettle One sent me a backpack when they welcomed me\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:48.000\ninto the alliance.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:49.000\nAnd I'm not...\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nThe story I'm going to tell you is not...\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:54.000\nYou're going to think that I'm pretending that I had feelings\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nfor this backpack.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nI really did.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:02.000\nBefore this happened, this was the first backpack I've ever had\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nthat I was like, that's a cool backpack.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nBecause that's like, who cares about a backpack?\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nThis backpack was cool.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nIt was a really cool backpack.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:14.000\nIt had a microchip in it that if I lost my backpack,\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:19.000\nor I assume was kidnapped while drinking Kettle One\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:22.000\nby Irish whiskey runners or something,\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:29.000\nthat Kettle One would pair a troop people in and, you know...\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:32.000\nWhat is the actual purpose of that microchip?\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nIt's like a low jack for your backpack,\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:39.000\na cracker jack.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:42.000\nI mean, that might be the quickest we've ever had a title\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nfor our episode.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nSo, we got a lot of guests tonight,\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nso let me rip through this.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:52.000\nSo, we're on the plane.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nWhat do you call it? The airplane?\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nYeah.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:59.000\nVirgin Atlantic has a bar on its plane in first class.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nIf there's a bar in any vehicle,\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nI'm going to spend all my time at it,\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nbecause it's just unprincipled.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nIf you had a bar in your car,\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\neven if it was the least comfortable spot in the car,\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:12.000\nI'd be like, I'm at a bar in a car!\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nYou know, when you get on a train and there's a bar car,\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:19.000\nand you jam in there, even though it's not going to treat you like shit.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:23.000\nBut there's a little tiny bar in a Virgin Atlantic flight,\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:27.000\nand I drank for, like, eight hours on the flight.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nErin was starting to feel...\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nShe wasn't up to too much drinking,\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:34.000\nand she ate this bacon buddy as we were landing.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:39.000\nLike, this is a bacon sandwich that they make in Europe, somehow.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nAnd apparently, it was kind of bad.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:47.000\nAnd I got off the plane, like, really at my most charming,\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:51.000\nbecause I got this atom bomb in my backpack\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nthat is instant happiness,\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:57.000\nand I just drank on a plane for eight hours,\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:00.000\nand I'm arriving at Heathrow Airport,\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nwhich is one of the most delightful places you could ever be.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:06.000\nIt's just the joy there is palpable.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:11.000\nI have a different relationship with that airport.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:14.000\nNo, Heathrow is pretty miserable, but...\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:19.000\nSo we get on this tram, and, well, so far, we're walking through the airport,\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:20.000\nand I'm just like...\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:23.000\nMeaning you've flown the ten and a half hours, ten hours to London,\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nand you have a connector to Edinburgh,\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nso you're getting your connecting flight.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nSo I'm doing bits, I'm looking at the sign going,\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\noh, that guy looks like you've got antlers,\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:34.000\nand Erin's like, yeah, well, shut up.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nAnd she went to the bathroom,\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:40.000\nand I think she said that she vomited in the bathroom, I think,\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:44.000\nand I'm like, oh, baby, it's a bad bacon buddy, yeah.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nWe get on this tram.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.000\nStop.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nWhat were you going to say?\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:51.000\nNothing.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:52.000\nYou were going to say something?\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nMeaningless question, go ahead.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.000\nNo, I want to know.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:59.000\nDid she throw up on the plane or in the airport?\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nI think the airport, I can't remember.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:06.000\nWhat a dumb question.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nDan, we have a lot of guests, get through this.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:09.000\nI know.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nIt's like, fucking, this is insane.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:14.000\nAnd guests that you have to treat right\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.000\nare they fucking fly the coop, man.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:18.000\nBirds on a wire should be the theme of the night.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:21.000\nWe got some humdingers, people that are hard guests.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nTell the story.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:26.000\nAll right.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nSo she's looking kind of queasy,\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:29.000\nand I'm on the tram with her,\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.000\nand I'm still kind of picking and grinning,\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nand what does that expression mean?\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:37.000\nYou're a banjo player, apparently.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nBut Aaron's not looking too good.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nI start rubbing her back on the tram,\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:44.000\nand she's like, can you stop rubbing my back?\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nAnd these trams are chock full of people.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:47.000\nThey're jams with people.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:48.000\nYeah, jammed up.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nA 10-minute tram from one terminal to the other.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:53.000\nYeah, we're just standing there holding the doohickeys,\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nthe handles, people, everyone's standing up.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nThere's a standing room only.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nWe're swaying and moving,\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nand Aaron says, can you please stop rubbing my back?\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nWhich, that's pretty nauseous\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:06.000\nwhen someone, you know, comfort is now making you sick.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nSo she gets this look on her face\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:11.000\nat a certain point that is unmistakable,\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:16.000\nand I instinctively, not consciously,\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:20.000\nbecause I loved this backpack.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:23.000\nInstinctively.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nBefore I knew what I was doing,\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nI had muscles in my arms,\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:31.000\nyears of college and bad improv troupe parties,\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:35.000\nand had muscle memories.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nUnzip the first zipper on the backpack,\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:40.000\nhold it wide open just as she leaned into it,\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:46.000\nand firehosed probably eight quarts of...\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:47.000\nWhat do you call it?\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:50.000\nVomit into the backpack,\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:53.000\nwhich again, and this is the poetic tragedy of it,\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nit's such a good backpack that it holds it\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:58.000\nlike a waterproof bucket.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:02.000\nThis isn't some jagged off Garfield knapsack\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:03.000\nthat your mom stuck you with.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:06.000\nThis isn't some bullshit for your pencils.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nThis thing has a computer in it.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:11.000\nIt's the night writer of backpacks.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:15.000\nIt holds shit, literally,\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:19.000\nand it's deep, but not a drop hits the floor.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:22.000\nAnd by the way, shout out to the Cosmopolitan community\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:24.000\nat the London Heathrow Airport.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nEverybody just totally, not in New York,\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:29.000\nkind of callous way, nothing against New York.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nYou do what you do to survive\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nwhen somebody has something to happen on a subway.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nBut just in this sort of like,\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nyeah, we all get it,\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:41.000\neveryone at London Heathrow is from way somewhere else\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:44.000\nand has been through all kinds of stuff, I assume.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nAnd if they haven't,\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:50.000\njust the environment kind of dictates that you feel that way.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:53.000\nThere was no gawking and there was no chiding\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:56.000\nand there was no, a couple of people moved away\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nout of politeness.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nAnd then one guy was standing right next to me\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nright at the end of it, like a real subtle move,\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:06.000\njust pulls out a little disposable Kleenex pack\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:09.000\nand offers it to Erin and she says thank you\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nand dabs her thing and the tram stops\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:14.000\nand I've got a backpack full of vomit\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:17.000\nand now I realize my house key is in there.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:20.000\nMy iPad mini is in there.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:23.000\nAnd the ring.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:36.000\nSo we get off the tram and we go to a bathroom.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:40.000\nIn situations like this where you find out there are bathrooms\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.000\nwhere you never would have known there was a bathroom,\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.000\nI don't think anyone had been to this bathroom.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:46.000\nIf you're at the grocery store and you have to pee all of a sudden\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:49.000\nyou're in some weird bathroom next to the eggs.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nBecause I had a backpack full of puke,\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:55.000\nI found a long lost bathroom at Heathrow Airport\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nunder a stairway or something.\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:01.000\nAnd I open it up and it's, you use your own imagination.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nBut it's like, and I'm going like,\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nErin's in the women's room, she's like,\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nshe's going are you all right?\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nAnd I'm like yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm in a stall\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\nand I'm like fuck, fuck.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\nI can hear her, she's calling out to me.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:17.000\nAnd I know where the house key is.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:21.000\nAnd it's six feet down, you know?\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:29.000\nAnd I'm just like, fuck.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:32.000\nI just got to thrust my hand in and pull out the key\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:35.000\nand put that down on the top of the toilet paper\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:36.000\njust in front of the chair.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:39.000\nI'm like okay, now we got to find my precious.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:44.000\nAnd we can be certain that in there, part of it is a bad bacon buddy.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:47.000\nAs a bacon roll, like yeah, it's not good.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:50.000\nShe didn't just have cream of wheat.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nIt's bad news then.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:53.000\nWhat is this?\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:56.000\nSpike and Mike's Twisted Animation Festival?\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:59.000\nYou want to talk about the puke?\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nI'm just trying to paint a picture.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nWere there carrots in it?\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:06.000\nThat's not Ed McMahon territory.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:09.000\nDon't tell me how to be a comptroller.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:14.000\nEveryone in the room could fill in their own puke blanks\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nabout the actual substance.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:19.000\nIn the history of the earth, there's never been pleasant vomit.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:22.000\nWhat does he have for breakfast?\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:27.000\nSo then I reach in and I get out the ring box.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:32.000\nI rinse everything off and she can hear me going fuck, fuck, fuck.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\nShe thinks I'm just mad at her for ruining the backpack\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:37.000\nbut of course I'm mad because I'm getting puke all over my hands\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nbecause there's stuff in there.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nAlso, I'm kind of thinking in my head,\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:45.000\nwell now, even if I fuck up the proposal, there's still a story.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:48.000\nSo it was kind of a good thing.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nI remember in my head thinking this is actually working out\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nexcept I'm losing the backpack.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:55.000\nAnd I know for sure, he threw up a airport of all places\n\n17:55.000 --> 18:00.000\nto put a, just take a backpack, a brand new backpack\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:05.000\nand there was one tiny trash can that was smaller than the backpack\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:09.000\nand I just kind of tried to get it in there but just left it.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:12.000\nCan you imagine after I got out of whatever plane,\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:15.000\nthere must have been like a bomb squad for sure,\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nlike circling this thing.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:20.000\nTwo, three, go, go, go, give me a report.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:27.000\nAnd then the guy comes up and opens it and goes like, ugh.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:32.000\nSo that happened and then I proposed on the muddy banks of the Loch Ness lock.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.000\nYeah.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nBut the puke, that's the story.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:41.000\nThe story, yeah.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:44.000\nBecause I fucked up, I kept walking around with the ring.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nSo because I'm walking around with this ring,\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:49.000\nbecause I'm burdened with creating this special moment,\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nI'm just burdened, I'm putting it on myself.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nThe dumbest thing I could have done, it turns out.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nAll the anxiety, all of the stress,\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nif I had just planned something,\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nI could have just spent the rest of the time,\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:02.000\nput the ring on top of the dresser at the hotel room\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:06.000\nor arrange with Kate to have her hold it.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:10.000\nI could have done a million things to just relax during the trip,\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:13.000\nbut because I want to play it organic and be Jim from the office,\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nI'm walking around with this lump in my pocket\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nand every time Aaron tries to hold my hand in a certain way,\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:22.000\nput it in my pocket, I'm like slapping her hand away.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:25.000\nShe's like, this is the worst trip ever.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nA boyfriend hates me.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nThere was one time when she started rubbing my thigh\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nin the backseat of the car, and at that point,\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nthat morning I had gone, you know what, fuck the box.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nThe box probably still has puke on it.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nIt's really hard to hide.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:38.000\nIt's a giant box.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:41.000\nI'm just going to take the ring and carry it around in my pocket.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nAnd then Aaron started rubbing my thigh in the back of the car\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:46.000\nvery romantically, and I grabbed her hand,\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:49.000\nlike all aspergery, like grabbed her hand,\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:54.000\nand you're like, is this what you want?\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:55.000\nYou want me to hold your hand?\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nIs that why you're rubbing it on me?\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nAnd she just looked at me, and I don't know,\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:00.000\nwhat can you say?\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:01.000\nWhat can you do?\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nThen I went to dinner with her.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:05.000\nI was like, okay, let's do a nice dinner.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nThis is our first night in Edinburgh, right?\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:11.000\nWe go to a decent place, but it's too shitty and cheesy.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:12.000\nIt's like a TGA Fridays.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nI'm not going to propose to her here.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nBut Aaron's bringing these presents,\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:19.000\nand somehow the lie became that I had a present for her.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:20.000\nBut this is after Christmas.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:22.000\nChristmas had already passed at this point.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:23.000\nWe're back in Edinburgh.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nYes, so she's anxious, but she hadn't given me her.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:26.000\nMy Christmas present chat.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nI don't have any Christmas presents for her.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:29.000\nAll I have is a ring.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:32.000\nBut you said we're going to do our presents later,\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:35.000\nbecause you didn't exchange presents on Christmas Eve\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nor Christmas because of this?\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:40.000\nI didn't plan anything.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:44.000\nI said at one point, every time Christmas presents came up,\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nI was like, we don't have to do that now.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nThere was never a good time to open presents.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:52.000\nThis is not an important part of the conversation.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nI would have gone with Christmas.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:03.000\nSeems like a good time for presents.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nSo we go to a restaurant, and then I'm getting mad at her\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nbecause she's trying to give me Christmas presents.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:14.000\nI'm like, can't we do that later?\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nAnd she's like, no, I really want to do it now.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:18.000\nAnd I rip open one, and it's like a keychain finder.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:20.000\nAnd I'm like, well, we're going to do this again.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:23.000\nBecause we already tried this, and these things don't work.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.000\nAnd she's like, what?\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nWhy am I sorry I got you Christmas presents?\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:27.000\nAnd I'm like, I don't know.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:28.000\nWhat's the next one?\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nHD spy camera pen?\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nFuck off.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:33.000\nCheck, please.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:34.000\nLet's just get out of here.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.000\nAnd she's like, what is happening?\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nWhat is going on?\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nI don't know.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:39.000\nI don't know.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nYou know what it sounds like to me?\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nIt sounds like you became Schedule Steve.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nYeah.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\nYeah.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nI atoned with that.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:50.000\nSo we went out walking in the night air at that boat.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nI was like, OK, this time I'm going to do it.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:55.000\nWe had a nice walk.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nYou guys went into the restaurant.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nI'm like, I'm going to talk to Erin over here.\n\n21:58.000 --> 21:59.000\nAnd I took her.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:02.000\nIt was pitch black, so I'm squishing around on the mud.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:05.000\nIt was absolute darkness on the bank.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:08.000\nThe next day, we would see that 30 yards away,\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:10.000\nthere was a perfect spot to propose.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:15.000\nOK, there was a place designed to feed Nessie out of your hand\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:20.000\nwhere swans would circle you and hummingbirds would pick\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:24.000\nthe wax out of your ears.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:28.000\nI did it by the wood chipper.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:32.000\nThere really was a couple of fallen trees and a tractor.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:35.000\nLike a sign for iron brew or something.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nA broken fence.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:41.000\nIt doesn't matter, because I'm a catch.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:44.000\nSo my proposal doesn't have to be amazing.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nMy marriage will be amazing.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:53.000\nAll right, let's get our cavalcade of guests up here.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nWait real quick, real quick.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:57.000\nBefore we do, what did she say?\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:58.000\nShe's going to do it.\n\n22:58.000 --> 22:59.000\nShe's going to give it a shot.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:04.000\nAll right, let's bring out our guests.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:26.000\nLet's bring Mitch Hurwitz up first.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:29.000\nFrom back there, it almost sounded as if you brought Jeff\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nwith you to propose to your girlfriend.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nIs that at all possible?\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:34.000\nI did kind of.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:35.000\nWhy were you together?\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:36.000\nWhat was the plan?\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nWe're inseparable.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:42.000\nNo, we had planned a long time ago to go on this Scottish vacation\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:45.000\ntogether for the holidays as a...\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:50.000\nIt's really weird.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nWould you ever travel with my family?\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:53.000\nWould you ever be game for that?\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:57.000\nI actually have.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nWe were in St. Martin together a couple of years ago.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:03.000\nThat's why I know you.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:06.000\nHave you already proposed to your wife, Mitch?\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nBecause Jeff's got some pointers.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nI have, unfortunately.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:13.000\nWait, what's that about?\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nYou told me I should have done it on Christmas.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nNo, I opened the gifts on Christmas.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:20.000\nOh, open the gifts on Christmas?\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.000\nI thought you said I would have done it on Christmas.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:24.000\nI would have proposed it on Christmas.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nYou said there's no good time to open the gifts.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:31.000\nI proposed to my wife on Hanukkah, so it was like an eight day.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:34.000\nI serialized it.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:38.000\nShe kind of saw it coming around day six.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:41.000\nI kept saying, you'll see.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:44.000\nNo presents.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:49.000\nAny advice for newlyweds?\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nOh, newlyweds.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:52.000\nYou know, it's funny.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:53.000\nI was in New York.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:57.000\nI have a very good friend who works at the Kettle One\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:01.000\nbackpack tracking center.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:04.000\nAnd just for fun, I said, bring up Dan Harmon.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:08.000\nAnd we went off of the grid, apparently, somewhere in Heathrow.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:09.000\nWe lost you.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:10.000\nWe couldn't figure out why.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:15.000\nYeah, that backpack is now deep under whatever the MI6.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nYeah, our guys went out there and they couldn't find it.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:21.000\nBut we picked you up with a keychain tracker.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nWe got you in Scotland.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:27.000\nDan, why weren't you pleased with the spy pen?\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nDid she give you a spy pen camera?\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:33.000\nI was in a tailspin because I didn't know when to propose\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nto my girlfriend and how to do it.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:42.000\nAnd was now, somehow, I had brought this jam box, OK?\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:47.000\nI re-gifted the jam box because I was just going to,\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nso I would have a Christmas gift.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nWe were going to exchange Christmas gifts in Scotland.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:54.000\nWell, she puked on the jam box, too.\n\n25:54.000 --> 26:00.000\nAnd after the puking thing, I gave her the jam box and said,\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nwell, here, you carry this now.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:05.000\nThat's your Christmas present.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:08.000\nBecause I had no backpack anymore.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:11.000\nThere was no more way to walk around with all my little ruses\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:15.000\nand a little Willy Wonka trick bag.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.000\nWere you nervous?\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nI got very nervous before I proposed.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:24.000\nAnd my whole plan was, well, actually, I kind of,\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:27.000\nI ended up, I was halfway through a metaphor.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:29.000\nAnd I realized I had to abandon it.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:32.000\nBut it's a better story if I didn't, which was that I started to say,\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:35.000\nlike, I really started to think, like, you know,\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:38.000\nsometimes you have to shit or get off the pod.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:45.000\nI'd like to take that shit with you.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:49.000\nReally almost. And actually, I remembered thinking,\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:52.000\nyou know, this, we've been in this relationship for a long time,\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nand she understands that this has been hard for me.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nAnd what I'm going to do is I'm going to say,\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nthis is a ring just to get us started.\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nJust totally misguided, you know.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:03.000\nBut it was going to be, this will just kind of, you know,\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\nand then we'll experience what it's like to be\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:07.000\nand we'll take our time and we'll see if it,\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:10.000\nand then, of course, when I was there and proposing,\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\nit just, it all tumbled out.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:13.000\nI want to have children with you.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:14.000\nI want my children to look like you.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:17.000\nI want you in my life forever.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:22.000\nI, when I, I just, if that's a waterfall,\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:25.000\nmine was just a fucking gridlock.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:29.000\nI just, and I ended up, like, the part of the gridlock\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:32.000\nthat was moving, the John McClain that got out of one car\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:36.000\nand walked along the roofs, was me talking about the ring\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:39.000\nand being like, oh, I wanted to get the one you wanted,\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:44.000\nbut that's the shopping.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:45.000\nI'm like, I haven't asked you to marry me yet\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\nand I'm like fucking talking about the fucking ring\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nof idiot, idiot, idiot.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:51.000\nYeah, and then you get the proposal out and you realize,\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\noh, wait, there's another step.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nYou do kind of feel like, ah, that's done.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:58.000\nOh, and you're, are you game or do you want to,\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:01.000\nyou want to assume, I assume.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:04.000\nYeah, I fucked up and I fucked up,\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:08.000\nbut it's okay because I'm a fuck up.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:09.000\nWhy not?\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:11.000\nThis is, and I think, you know, first of all,\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nthe first wives are, well, I don't want to say that.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:16.000\nNo, they have to, they understand that the, you know.\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:20.000\nBut they, I think it's fantastic.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:21.000\nI really do.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:24.000\nIt's the second wife that really gets the,\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nthat really, that scoreboard at the stadium.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:28.000\nWhere did the music come from?\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:29.000\nI talked to the guy.\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:30.000\nI know the guy.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:33.000\nThis isn't my first time on the rodeo, honey.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nWill you marry me?\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nBut in the middle of an actual...\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:38.000\nAbracadabra!\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:41.000\nHow did you get the rodeo clowns to stop?\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nI know everybody here.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:47.000\nHow did you, how did you fit the ring in your penis?\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:48.000\nAnd have it come out?\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:51.000\nWell, I, I, apparently, that this might be apocryphal,\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nbut we, you might know this comedy writer\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:57.000\nwho proposed to someone by putting that up as Anus.\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:58.000\nWhat?\n\n28:58.000 --> 28:59.000\nYeah.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:04.000\nAnd said, I think in the chat, Dino?\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nDino's first husband.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:09.000\nNo, I, I can't, I can't...\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:12.000\nWell, this doesn't go any further.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:14.000\nNo, I, I can't, I can't, I can't.\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:17.000\nWhat is his name where I'm with?\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:22.000\nMaybe we better bring him out.\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nHarris Wittels is here tonight.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:25.000\nGood.\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:35.000\nHi, hello.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:39.000\nIf you wanna, if you, if you wanna pretend it's not you, that's fine.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.000\nI thought that was Urban Legend, but that's true.\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:42.000\nYeah, you know who it is?\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:43.000\nYeah.\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:44.000\nYeah.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:45.000\nI think it's true.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:47.000\nWell, what was the, within the Urban Legend,\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:48.000\nwhat is the motivation?\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nWas it humor or sexual?\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:51.000\nIt was humor.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:52.000\nYeah, like, aren't I interesting?\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nAnd, and you know...\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:55.000\nApparently...\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:58.000\nAnd she apparently didn't see it as a warning, a big warning.\n\n29:58.000 --> 29:59.000\nIt's good.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\nYoung ladies, please.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:05.000\nYou don't need this much interesting in your life.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:06.000\nIt's a good final test.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:07.000\nIs this writer still alive?\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:08.000\nYes.\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:09.000\nOkay.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:10.000\nYes.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\nI mean, there was some, some anal hemorrhage.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:13.000\nThat's what you're asking?\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:14.000\nYeah.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:15.000\nThere was some internal bleeding.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:16.000\nI mean...\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:17.000\nIt's a diamond ring.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:18.000\nWas it?\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:19.000\nWas it?\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:22.000\nI guess my question is, was it square cut, marquee, pear?\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:23.000\nWhat, what, what?\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:25.000\nI think it was missing a baguette when it came.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nI don't know.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nUgh.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nI feel like shit.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:32.000\nDo you guys want to talk about something funny for me?\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:33.000\nDo you feel bad?\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:34.000\nDo you feel...\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:35.000\nI feel terrible.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:40.000\nI told, I got Scottish, like, I don't know what the hell you'd call it.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:44.000\nI woke up the day after New Year's and it was like, like that, that, that, that cold,\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nsharp, like little feeling in your chest.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:51.000\nAnd you can just feel it, like, like, exponentially, like,

--> 30:58.000\nLet's have kids.\n\n30:58.000 --> 30:59.000\nBecause she's so fucking sick.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:00.000\nAnd when are we going to buy a house together?\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:03.000\nI started saying, like, I could feel something bad coming out.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:04.000\nAnd she's like, knock it off.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nJust, just say you're not sick.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nSave it till you get home.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nAnd I'm like, this isn't one of those.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:11.000\nThis is like a thing.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nAnd now she's,

she, she, when we got to Ireland, she, she woke up the next day and was like,\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:29.000\nAnd I was, I was like, boo, yeah.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:32.000\nMy legs hurt from

31:49.000\nI was immediately worried that I was going to have to be very funny during this game.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nThat's what I was worried about.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:55.000\nBut then I got there and no one was joking around and everyone was very mad at me for not,\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:56.000\nit was full court.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:58.000\nThey're like, you fucking get back on

32:11.000\nI can't, I can't get back on D.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:12.000\nSo I quit.\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:13.000\nI just walked off it.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:14.000\nYou did really?\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:15.000\nDid you?\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nI was like, I can't, I can't keep up with you guys there.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nIt's like comedy store guys.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nSo they're good looking and funny.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:22.000\nYeah.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:26.000\nThe comedy store guys are legidarily handsome.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:29.000\nThe new breed of comedy store comic is, yeah.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:32.000\nI think they fall in like, they ain't cooked.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:33.000\nRight.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:36.000\nCause they had to have a Myspace profile with a shirt off or something.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nSo they are very good looking.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:39.000\nYeah.\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:42.000\nThe comic's was Dom, was Dama Rara there?\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:43.000\nThat's what I'm talking about.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:46.000\nAnd he's the guy that stuck the wedding ring in his ass.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:47.000\nThis is not.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nNo, it's not.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:50.000\nIt's not.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nIt doesn't sound like the tallest team.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:54.000\nIt was, yeah.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nThey were all, I was shocking.\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:59.000\nIt was like they, it was ringers from, like, Space Jam.\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:06.000\nI don't, I don't understand that, that, that I don't, I don't know if I'm jealous or resentful\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nor angry or intimidated.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:12.040\nI thought for once I'm gonna not only do drugs on the weekend\n\n33:12.040 --> 33:17.880\nRight, and I'm gonna go play basketball, and I was like this is why I chose my path\n\n33:20.280 --> 33:24.240\nYeah, I sports I mean fuck you yeah fuck you\n\n33:24.880 --> 33:30.720\nLike like sports has anyone in this room ever lived longer by playing sports? No\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:33.360\nNo\n\n33:33.360 --> 33:37.280\nThere is nobody point. They're all exactly the age they are\n\n33:42.680 --> 33:49.820\nDo you think by now we would have fit really legitimately figured out like like like like if that if you dribbled a basketball\n\n33:50.160 --> 33:58.440\nMore than another guy that you're fucking here. Do you still get the cancers in the has anybody here died of cancer because of sports?\n\n33:58.440 --> 34:00.440\nNobody\n\n34:01.640 --> 34:06.520\nIt's just it's pretty random man like my family's a bunch of hillbillies, you know\n\n34:06.520 --> 34:09.440\nThey they they just live random distances\n\n34:10.440 --> 34:16.440\nMurder each other it really is because because guys in in utero are flooded with testosterone\n\n34:16.440 --> 34:23.540\nWe don't develop like I was just reading something about how women check little girls check faces all the time and boys don't\n\n34:23.540 --> 34:27.980\nNo, yeah, yeah, we're not so do you think do you think if I played sports that I would\n\n34:28.260 --> 34:30.940\nBecause I played softball for the starburn softball team\n\n34:30.940 --> 34:34.300\nMaybe I did do you think do you think that I would I would yell less\n\n34:34.300 --> 34:40.660\nI would like get I would have less did you really believe that you can channel like a certain amount of rage\n\n34:41.340 --> 34:48.220\nEnergy, I think you'd be I think you'd be less funny. I think you know what I mean. I think you would I think it would come out\n\n34:49.020 --> 34:51.020\nYou're funny though\n\n34:51.020 --> 34:57.020\nYeah, we walked off probably don't play you don't play I play drums and people are like that's where you get your age out\n\n34:57.020 --> 35:01.420\nBut it's like that has nothing to do with that and also musicians are all assholes, too\n\n35:02.340 --> 35:04.900\nEveryone stays angry always. I guess is my point\n\n35:07.340 --> 35:09.940\nWas there anybody on the court you don't have to name names\n\n35:09.940 --> 35:14.100\nBut was there anybody that was a really good basketball player and also somebody you thought was very funny\n\n35:15.020 --> 35:17.860\nIt was no because it was a lot of like newer calm\n\n35:17.860 --> 35:22.060\nThat's not an insult. I just haven't seen a lot. I don't hang out at the store a lot. So it was a lot of guys comics\n\n35:22.060 --> 35:24.060\nI haven't seen the store\n\n35:26.380 --> 35:31.420\nIt's like it's like a fashion runway now over at the store. Yeah, it's not being about the jokes\n\n35:31.420 --> 35:35.900\nIt's just about the fun. It's about how you look. Yeah. Yeah, it's just just beefcake comedy\n\n35:35.900 --> 35:38.340\nThey should call it the they should call it the beefcake store\n\n35:39.620 --> 35:43.060\nHey, so what do you what's the plan? We kind of buried the lead here\n\n35:43.060 --> 35:45.860\nWhat are you gonna do about the wedding and what are you thinking about that?\n\n35:45.860 --> 35:50.980\nI don't know. We've been having no, no, we haven't set a date. We have to have a preliminary discussion about\n\n35:52.380 --> 35:58.620\nAbout you know first thing I got to rule out is the possibility of a truly conceptual wedding\n\n35:58.860 --> 36:02.420\nBecause if we're gonna have one of those then you know, maybe equipment needs to be commissioned\n\n36:02.420 --> 36:08.060\nYeah, isn't the point of an engagement that you can push off having to think about the wedding for a while\n\n36:08.060 --> 36:10.060\nThat's what I thought it was\n\n36:10.060 --> 36:14.660\nHey, we're engaged. We don't have to get married. I think you got to start a long time. I think you got to start uh, I\n\n36:15.660 --> 36:22.140\nDon't know looking at stuff pretty quickly. You should have a community themed wedding, but make it about the port and Weissman year\n\n36:25.940 --> 36:27.940\nGrosso, sorry. Yeah\n\n36:29.500 --> 36:31.740\nJust everything from that year\n\n36:31.740 --> 36:38.860\nYeah, well I just you know you can say well I just seemed arrogant to make it about my own yeah\n\n36:40.340 --> 36:42.340\nBut I've got all these great contacts\n\n36:44.020 --> 36:48.380\nDan will work on the show. Were you saying that you said you want to rule out a high concept wedding?\n\n36:48.380 --> 36:53.260\nNo, I'm saying like that's the first thing that needs to be eliminated before we say book us your\n\n36:53.500 --> 36:56.460\nNice place to get married. That's just a pretty place to get married\n\n36:56.460 --> 37:02.140\nI first all want to continue to talk to Aaron. We're workshopping in conversations about hydraulics and things\n\n37:02.740 --> 37:07.220\nYou know, we may need to rent an airplane hangar if we want to do something special\n\n37:07.220 --> 37:12.140\nWhoo, and then you're there a big celebrity doesn't show up and you get like Terry Bradshaw. Yeah\n\n37:15.420 --> 37:19.500\nEverybody I know has ever done a show have you been on a show where you I just heard that he is\n\n37:19.500 --> 37:27.260\nBooked on my friend show.

Say hi to Terry Bradshaw\n\n37:32.300 --> 37:34.300\nTwo weeks later, and he said you're not gonna believe he's on stage\n\n37:36.100 --> 37:41.820\nTerry Bradshaw you actually called it. Yeah, I like doing that with not recently but older McConaughey movies\n\n37:41.820 --> 37:44.700\nOr I'm like I wonder who they went who were the first four guys\n\n37:44.700 --> 37:46.700\nI\n\n37:49.140 --> 37:55.780\nBooked two jobs at least maybe three when the guy because a lot of people have to pass before I get a job and\n\n37:57.020 --> 38:00.500\nWhat's his name of the the quarterback from Jerry McGuire?\n\n38:02.940 --> 38:04.940\nNo, no Jerry McConnell\n\n38:05.820 --> 38:06.820\npush-lash\n\n38:06.820 --> 38:10.240\nWhen Jerry McConnell passes, that's when I have start having a chance\n\n38:10.240 --> 38:12.240\nJerry\n\n38:13.040 --> 38:19.800\nWhatever the fuck is easy be trained now is he used to do the show Jerry O'Connell.

Yeah, I think if I was done editing it and I could tell you\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:41.880\nI could give it a letter grade for you, but I have no idea\n\n44:41.880 --> 44:46.200\nI mean, I know it's like like at the end of the episode where he leaves here did like like\n\n44:47.040 --> 44:51.160\ntears everywhere like uncontrollably. It's unavoidable\n\n44:52.080 --> 44:54.080\nbut\n\n44:54.080 --> 45:03.920\nI'm gonna make it funny though. Just I would just cut that stuff out. Don't worry about it\n\n45:11.280 --> 45:14.160\nCan I say something just sort of change the topic you're getting I was\n\n45:14.160 --> 45:23.240\nYou're getting married and that's very exciting and I don't want to so I was at I just want to tell you this quick story\n\n45:24.120 --> 45:26.480\nIt's incredibly ominous beginning of the story\n\n45:26.720 --> 45:34.360\nWell, I'm just really hoping that Emily's not here anymore because we were at her house for Christmas and her mother\n\n45:34.360 --> 45:36.360\nLahu I love it as a wonderful woman\n\n45:36.720 --> 45:40.520\ninsisted that LeBron James was Kanye West\n\n45:40.520 --> 45:43.640\nduring a basketball game\n\n45:44.520 --> 45:50.520\nThe LeBron was seeing the two of them in a room together. So wait. She said she's thought that\n\n45:50.680 --> 45:55.920\nHe has an alter ego like that. No, she was like that's Kanye West and his stats were up\n\n45:55.920 --> 46:01.920\nSo I was like not only did you think Kanye plays in the NBA, but also that he shocked 60% from the field\n\n46:01.920 --> 46:11.640\nWhat was there's a Delante West in the NBA who had sex with LeBron James's mother, which is great\n\n46:12.400 --> 46:16.400\nIs that confirmed? That's a great story. Yeah confirmed. Otherwise, it'd be fighting words\n\n46:17.080 --> 46:19.080\nThat's how you know\n\n46:19.440 --> 46:21.440\nStop talking about sports. Oh\n\n46:22.360 --> 46:24.360\nOkay, she also\n\n46:26.880 --> 46:30.360\nThey were talking about fucking they were talking about fucking it's about fucking bro\n\n46:30.360 --> 46:35.000\nShe also referred to Will Smith as Jada Pinkett's husband\n\n46:36.360 --> 46:40.760\nShe's like, what was that movie that Jada Pinkett's husband? We were like Will Smith?\n\n46:40.760 --> 46:44.840\nI think she's the most feminist racist of all time\n\n46:45.400 --> 46:49.120\nEven Jada's mom is like I was hanging out with Will Smith's wife\n\n46:49.800 --> 46:54.800\nDid you watch David Blaine show magic to the Smith family? No, no where he\n\n46:54.800 --> 47:01.560\nNo, yeah, that was fantastic. They speaking of tears they he did one trick and it made all of the Smiths cry\n\n47:02.680 --> 47:07.160\nLiterally Jada was crying Jaden was crying. Did he make Donald Glover? They believe in magic\n\n47:08.160 --> 47:10.160\nAnd now Donald Glover is gone\n\n47:10.960 --> 47:12.960\nJust it always gets them\n\n47:13.200 --> 47:17.960\nI like the one always gets cheers. I saw a clip that someone sent me on YouTube for some reason\n\n47:17.960 --> 47:23.840\nYeah, yeah, he's in Harrison Ford's kitchen and he pulls a thing out of an orange and Harrison Ford just tells him to fuck off\n\n47:27.360 --> 47:29.360\nWhich is kind of like air force\n\n47:31.440 --> 47:33.440\nMy wife my kids\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:35.360\nthe\n\n47:35.360 --> 47:40.520\nDo you guys have any opinion about buffet roast beef like like the way that it's\n\n47:42.360 --> 47:47.040\nLeft by the way big opinions big opinions over there Tyler just left\n\n47:47.040 --> 47:52.760\nI was I was talking to Aaron about this and this is the one note. I came back with from Europe\n\n47:52.760 --> 47:57.520\nI was just looking at my every note thing. That's the one thing I wrote said roast beef in a buffet is for grown-ups\n\n48:00.520 --> 48:05.840\nI don't I feel very uncomfortable when you go up and there's a guy with the hat and the\n\n48:06.760 --> 48:10.040\nAnd then and then he's like like what what what would you like?\n\n48:12.560 --> 48:14.800\nWhy haven't you finished before I got here?\n\n48:14.800 --> 48:19.140\nWell, you have to kind of pretend that what he's doing takes some real skill\n\n48:19.880 --> 48:26.480\nJust that one little Pete that just exact same quarter-inch. You're slicing for everything. Wow. Thank you. Nice. Well, so Dan\n\n48:27.480 --> 48:32.480\nYou won't be surprised to know that I grew up in a family that has prime rib buffet opinions\n\n48:32.480 --> 48:36.680\nLike my mom and dad would actually say I would rather get give me that part\n\n48:36.680 --> 48:38.680\nGive me that probably they come out and go\n\n48:38.680 --> 48:40.960\nI want that one to this or that they have names for it\n\n48:40.960 --> 48:45.520\nBut sometimes there's chicken or turkey and they go like you want white meat or dark meat. I don't know what the fuck you're talking\n\n48:45.520 --> 48:48.320\nAbout man. I don't work under that hood. Just feed me\n\n48:52.280 --> 48:54.280\nI'm a writer\n\n48:56.400 --> 49:02.000\nDifferent kinds of meat and the same animal. I don't know white meat is way better and I'm not that's well\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:06.240\nThat's inaccurate. I didn't oh you like brown. I didn't mean to start this go down this road\n\n49:06.240 --> 49:11.960\nBut white meat is dry and shitty. Oh fuck out. No get the fuck out of my kitchen. I\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:16.760\nThink I think they're confused because I think in a lot of Indian restaurants. They have\n\n49:25.960 --> 49:31.800\nThanksgiving I just get like the stuffing and the mac and cheese like I don't even I secretly like people people are always like\n\n49:31.800 --> 49:37.320\nYou go try the turkey or spend all the time on the turkey. Good. Fuck you tough titties for spending time on turkeys\n\n49:37.320 --> 49:43.120\nSo you weren't eating turkey on Thanksgiving and someone said maybe you should try the turkey and then you got mad\n\n49:44.680 --> 49:50.400\nHave the turkey on Thanksgiving. Yeah, you started by saying this is this is a European UK thing\n\n49:50.920 --> 49:54.560\nIs that the first time you've encountered the guy in the house? No, I was just talking to Aaron about it\n\n49:54.560 --> 49:59.280\nSo I thumbed it into my phone because she was bewildered. She's like, what are you talking about roast beef is grown-up food?\n\n49:59.280 --> 50:02.720\nWhat does that mean you're 41 and I was like, yeah\n\n50:02.720 --> 50:08.320\nBut it's just like I just my brain shuts off when I see that the cutting board with the juice and the yeah\n\n50:08.320 --> 50:13.560\nThere's like a half-cut shank of something and the guy's like like he's gonna cut the meat for you\n\n50:13.560 --> 50:19.720\nAnd you're gonna participate and it's just it's so it's so I don't like the locals to do where they act like they're like\n\n50:19.720 --> 50:21.720\nhooking you up\n\n50:23.600 --> 50:28.120\nI always feel like like like like like it's possible to do it wrong\n\n50:28.120 --> 50:33.480\nI got because because because it would be it's so absurd to answer honestly. What would you like I?\n\n50:34.400 --> 50:36.400\nroast beef\n\n50:36.920 --> 50:38.920\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n50:39.920 --> 50:41.920\nyell that at him\n\n50:43.920 --> 50:48.000\nRoast beef I want I think I'm not anymore not like this\n\n50:49.360 --> 50:51.360\nI don't I don't\n\n50:51.360 --> 50:55.280\nYou don't live in that hood. It's like close-up magic or something all of a sudden. It's like like\n\n50:55.280 --> 51:00.760\nThey're thinking well, what's your birthday? What kind of like you want to hear a story about three kings?\n\n51:04.480 --> 51:06.880\nWhy didn't they cut it before I got there? I already\n\n51:10.160 --> 51:15.720\nYeah, it's very good roast beef. Well Taylor shanters one of my favorites. That's a laurie. Yeah, yeah\n\n51:15.720 --> 51:18.760\nYeah, so that's I'll say I'd like you to just cut a hole right in the middle.

I found out that I like the the end of it because it's the salty part\n\n51:30.640 --> 51:35.360\nYeah, they put all the seasonings but you can't you can't just say to that guy you can't it's right over there\n\n51:35.360 --> 51:38.120\nThat's why he's asking to give me the edge give me the top give me the thing\n\n51:38.120 --> 51:43.080\nYou can say I'll see well that just confirms my suspicion that there's all this but it's like getting into a flight simulator\n\n51:44.160 --> 51:49.400\nGive me the edge give me the top that would be a cool proposal though is put the ring in the fucking\n\n51:49.400 --> 51:53.640\nYeah, I like hey get the top.

Not only is it wonderful to just see a bunch of brown faces again, but it's also all that you know\n\n01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.680\nIt's also nice to see all of the all of the mutts\n\n01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.760\nWhite faces like like all of us of European descent\n\n01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:57.680\nWe're still all fucking snaggled and like like like mixed up and like like like over there\n\n01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.960\nThey're like they look like like action figures of British people like they there's a\n\n01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.340\nYou can kind of feel the the the the inbreeding\n\n01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:12.200\nYeah, like any group any group that stays kind of homogenous. Yeah, I don't want to yeah\n\n01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:17.400\nI don't want to say there's some big dudes in Scotland. There's some fucking. I'm just shy of six four\n\n01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:24.600\nThere's some giant motherfuckers out there. Oh, we went into a pub where people must have been next to some put the shark-punching factory\n\n01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.040\nAnd then there was they were on lunch break\n\n01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.840\nSpeaking of house of brewery at the buffet thing the night before\n\n01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.520\nWell, actually no come on sport.

Is it like a pink thing?\n\n01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.440\nNo, I'm not doing a bit\n\n01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:47.780\nI would it's a it's a Scott's Kelt word. I think for for their New Year's celebration\n\n01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:55.560\nWe got kilts we rented them and it only occurred to me like after we'd rented them actually right before we'd rented them\n\n01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.520\nYou're renting a piece of fabric where you're not allowed to wear underwear like properly\n\n01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:05.720\nSo I was like, oh, you see your dicks gonna be rubbing up against the front of a thing that has been rubbed against countless dicks\n\n01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:10.240\nBut I thought no, so you're sitting down on something like like that's just countless assholes on that\n\n01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:15.480\nWe're worried about the asshole. Yeah, and none of that occurs to me. Also, and you might be wearing it backwards\n\n01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:25.840\nWhich is really well I wore it sideways. Well, when you wear clothes, it's not like your asshole is rubbing on the clothes, right?\n\n01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.960\nYou know, I'm just saying you sit down. You have an Audi. You have a naked\n\n01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.480\nYes, I do\n\n01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:42.260\nI'm saying I'm saying naked naked ass against the against that old saying if you're gonna rent a Kelt wear it sideways. Yeah\n\n01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:51.040\nMy girlfriend is Scottish and she insisted that you you cannae wear knickers. Unless you're a pussy\n\n01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.560\nAnd so so I'm so we're not wearing it\n\n01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:57.760\nWe've been you didn't wear yours in the morning of it in Vanessa, but Matt MacGorley and I we flashed her\n\n01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:01.360\nShe said you got to go out to Loch Ness and flash your balls at\n\n01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.200\nAt that Nessie I go. Oh, so we did it. We took a picture of us flashing our\n\n01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:11.600\nReally just me and Matt Gurley my friends in seventh grade just flashing our Nessie's gonna look a lot like my dad in the bushes\n\n01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.880\nBut we did that I\n\n01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:19.920\nSaid like there's people like there's families kind of near us not facing our dicks and balls\n\n01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:24.400\nBut like like around I'm like is that kind of a corny like touristy thing that they're just like no\n\n01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.760\nI did that.

So we did that\n\n01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:32.000\nBut we I was I'm driving back the three-hour ride from Inverness back to Edinburgh\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.920\nWe stop at House of Brewer to get lunch and go shop on and stuff and I got my kilt on and there was a glass\n\n01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:41.820\nAwesomely at a place that sells kilt. There's a glass stairway a glass spiral staircase\n\n01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:50.200\nTo get from one part of the fucking House of Brewer to the restaurant you have to go down that staircase I\n\n01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.500\nI learned and there's fucking families down there. And I was like like\n\n01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:59.740\nFuck it went in Rome, baby.

It's a stop getting tortured under there\n\n01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:38.060\nBut the spore and my wiener just turns into like a nipple\n\n01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:42.900\nEspecially in that kind of cold it just recedes into me like an octopus cup\n\n01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:48.420\nUse my dick to rob a skyscraper like a cat burglar\n\n01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:50.420\nI could\n\n01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:56.740\nIf I had another one, I guess you need another deck your dick didn't get sort you dick didn't get rubbed in the thing\n\n01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:01.660\nAnd then no, I'm telling you it recedes not there are growers and showers and then there's old\n\n01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.700\ncamera here\n\n01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:13.740\nMatt and I both had the same experience where you have the spore and which holds your you know your keys and your phone and your\n\n01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:19.340\nAnd you should have a hip flask in there.

Did you ever get made fun of you you betcha\n\n01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.560\nSchrab had a gym teacher named mr. Reamer\n\n01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:20.000\nI we had a someone named miss Dickey who is dating our band teacher named mr. Titsworth\n\n01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.880\nIt's worth and miss Dickey\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.760\nI didn't know and wrote that you know when your family name is Titsworth that's somewhere in the past your family like saved the king's life because\n\n01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:40.180\nOtherwise you would be weeded out wait a minute. We're Titsworth's\n\n01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:43.240\nWe teach that's what we do\n\n01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:47.980\nWe do two things we save kings and we teach English a\n\n01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.900\nGuy came to our high school\n\n01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:55.380\nWhen I was like a senior and from the Princeton review to talk about preparing for the SATs\n\n01:07:55.380 --> 01:08:00.820\nAnd his name was dick moorhead and we did sure a fucking we didn't hear a thing. He said for two hours\n\n01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:04.380\nWe were never heard anything. He's ever said\n\n01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.100\nHe gets to be president just because he's\n\n01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:14.900\nActually, it's Richard. I go by Richard. All right, whatever. He's right. It was Richard, but we connected those dots\n\n01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:18.540\nDo we settle the roast beef thing?\n\n01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.420\nYou know what I don't like about it\n\n01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:25.460\nMaybe I don't like if my food resembles an animal in any way\n\n01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:29.260\nThat's why I don't eat fish because it looks still like the animal. Is that what it is like you see the ball\n\n01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:33.780\nHe doesn't like the idea that there's a right or wrong way to eat roast beef\n\n01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:39.620\nAnd I don't like social interaction at a buffet like I don't I don't I don't want when they ask you what?\n\n01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:43.660\nPeople acting like professionals about ridiculous. I mean, these are guys that used to build dams\n\n01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:48.860\nYou know what I mean? Like these are the same people that would have got skyscrapers in the 30s, you know\n\n01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:53.600\nYeah, I don't know. Yeah, I just don't I just don't like it. I get uncomfortable\n\n01:08:54.100 --> 01:09:01.080\nWhen when when when I'm talking to somebody, okay? I am in a crisis mode like I if I have somebody\n\n01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:06.560\nCome comes up to me after the show and don't do this. I'll give you scotch flu\n\n01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:09.320\nbut\n\n01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:15.320\nSo when someone comes up to me and says hello, my name is so-and-so. It's nice to meet you like I'm\n\n01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.720\nBarely hearing like five percent of that well. Well, I'm just like\n\n01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:30.920\nAnd that's the point of course when they're going my name is Jonathan or whatever so I'm never gonna remember\n\n01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.920\nYou're turning to Al Pacino\n\n01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:42.320\nCuz you got a point out what is it? Do you think it's because is it because you're you're you don't want to let them down?\n\n01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:47.440\nNo, I think it's because I'd like to retract that I'm not gonna get modeling about it\n\n01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:52.280\nBut I think my theory is that as a child when my brain was developing\n\n01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:59.860\nI think that those were the moments of crisis. I mean the like for other people probably moments of isolation were moments of crisis\n\n01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:02.520\nI have a lot of memories about being left places\n\n01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.320\nAnd feeling a tremendous amount of relief\n\n01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:11.200\nThe mall I would say yeah, I love it\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:19.240\nMy I was like I was like hiding under a table at nurseries to daycare center at a bowling alley once and they didn't know\n\n01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.600\nI was there so they kind of wrapped everything up. I didn't like the other kids\n\n01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:25.840\nI was just I would just like find a cupboard and I just climb in it\n\n01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:31.080\nAnd I would just sit there and I was I was not doing it to be melodramatic. I just I just like like too too much\n\n01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:36.700\nMan with the people like like like girls would put crayons in your mouth and like like like what one girl did\n\n01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.520\nYeah, this is not a standard experience. I don't I should\n\n01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:45.080\nYou know, I don't want to be sexist. There was one girl put a crayon in my mouth\n\n01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:50.880\nThat sounds horrible. That's like such a violation. She's what she was trying to do like a lipstick thing\n\n01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.640\nShe probably liked you. She probably liked me, but but too much too much too much\n\n01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:02.960\nand and and and and so like like I think that my brain while developing its circuitry\n\n01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:08.680\nIdentifies those moments. It's like, you know, it's just there's a lot of like there's a lot of like toll booths and things\n\n01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:13.320\nAnd there's just a lot of shit to keep track of and it's just like like eye contact\n\n01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:16.920\nFor me is the\n\n01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:23.440\nMental equivalent of holding a microphone in front of a speaker like I when I look somebody in the eye\n\n01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.440\nIt's such a perfect one for Aaron to come to\n\n01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.800\nJust how I wish he knew this\n\n01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:37.960\nDoes Wally look like a perfect sort of like a society to you Wally the movie. Yeah. Yeah, I like that. I'd like to be Wally\n\n01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:46.040\nDo you feel it's because there's something expected of you I'm trying to like narrow in I think that all humans fear\n\n01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:52.240\nExcommunication alienation. I think that I think that in those moments. It's make or break\n\n01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:59.520\nI would I think that I think that if you're not good at sports and you're not like you're not gifted socially on the playground\n\n01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.520\nI think I think\n\n01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:09.320\nIt's it's at those moments when people are talking to you when you're at the most danger of getting kicked out of\n\n01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.480\nThe monkey tree right of being exposed\n\n01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:18.040\nWe are actually likes going to parties like a certain point that it becomes more\n\n01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:21.160\nWorry than like all right. I'm gonna party tonight\n\n01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:28.280\nIt was like, oh, I'm gonna see them or do what I think it's a line from Seinfeld once but I remember I've always felt\n\n01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.000\nI assure you not your not what you said\n\n01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.960\nBut what George said was something like I've never been upset about a meeting being cancelled or something\n\n01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:40.520\nOh, yeah, I really feel that way. Yeah, there's no meeting that I wouldn't be happy if they have to move\n\n01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:46.280\nAnd you know, I get to be put out. Oh, I'm halfway to Burbank. Okay. No, you know what? I totally get it\n\n01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.280\nYeah, they're the one to do it. Yeah\n\n01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.640\nThat is great, I like going to parties. I'm sorry\n\n01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.880\nI feel like going\n\n01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:01.240\nWell, he's like the Kumail was voted like sexiest\n\n01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.760\nSexiest\n\n01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.760\nSlave mother-in-law\n\n01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000\nWhich is worrying on a couple levels\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.600\nI found like my Scottish girlfriend Kate was saying like like when you go to Scotland like like don't\n\n01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:24.120\nDon't be so gregarious. Don't like don't like don't introduce yourself. Yeah, I kept embarrassing her like hello\n\n01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:27.840\nI'm Jeff like they don't fucking do it. I apparently but nobody was bummed out by it\n\n01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.280\nBut she's like like they didn't do it there like like they don't they like like people don't just walk up and go\n\n01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.320\nHow do you do? Like they don't do that. So I kept getting teased for being\n\n01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:41.960\nLike like chatty and gregarious but thing is like everybody was cool with it\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.080\nBut like that I thought like you would really like that down like it's a culture of people like they tend to be a little more\n\n01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:52.720\nLeconic and like well, it's colder. You covered up, right? There's all these things you do to kind of keep yourself away from\n\n01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:59.960\nI think like I've always been very like like good in a room and good in a crowd\n\n01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:03.480\nBut I think I also part of that. Hello. How do you do stuff?\n\n01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:07.840\nI also forget names because during that five five minutes or that five seconds of meeting somebody\n\n01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:13.280\nI'm not paying attention to somebody's name. I forget names all the fucking time\n\n01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.640\nI did it in the in the green room just now like I'm terrible at it. Mitch\n\n01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.760\nThere's actually great I work on Cheers, right? Yeah, okay\n\n01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:27.440\nReading a thing about how there's a great way to remember people's names like you can remember anybody's name\n\n01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.840\nYou have to care\n\n01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.840\nYeah, see that\n\n01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:38.760\nThat's a bridge too far. I know it's a bridge too far. It's a tough. It's a tough. I do I could draw somebody afterwards\n\n01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:41.480\nI remember I can remember everything they wore it could be two years later\n\n01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:47.320\nI could remember I could tell you the conversation verbatim. I don't know your fucking name. Yeah, I think that's pretty common actually\n\n01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:54.200\nI don't think that's so I'm gonna say I'm special but like I I'm good at like like chatting with people and being like\n\n01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.720\nconvivial and stuff like that, but I think I\n\n01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:03.080\nI also and that's my way of keeping people like like the Heisman trophy kind of an arms length\n\n01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.840\nYou know, like I hold on to what's dear and we're gonna press people\n\n01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:09.640\nCan you stop talking about sports, please? Yeah, it's my podcast\n\n01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:16.720\nI'll go through a party invite and look at the guest list, you know where you can see who's replied yesterday\n\n01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:22.000\nAnd I will go through and all the people that have replied. Yes, I will I will picture the conversation\n\n01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.620\nI will be having with that person and if there's ever an awkward one. I'm like, I can't go to this\n\n01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.160\nBut I'll see you feel like I just went. Yeah\n\n01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:39.040\nIt saves gas it saves money also Netflix Q you don't have to watch. Yeah, you've read the descriptions\n\n01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.720\nYou never say goodbye at parties\n\n01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:46.120\nThat's and so my mission became for a full couple months to catch you trying to leave\n\n01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:51.080\nYeah, and I would I would like call you out. It's crazy that we have to say bye or\n\n01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:56.800\nBecause because if you said if you say goodbye to everyone at the party, that's called being at the party twice\n\n01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.920\nThat's what you do it when you get to the party\n\n01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.400\nYou go say hi to everybody\n\n01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.360\nYou're not leaving you'd have to go to each of them and say well, I'm not leaving\n\n01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.640\nIt's so I'm gonna go up to somebody like I am leaving so you might want to\n\n01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:15.640\nI\n\n01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:21.760\nPick one person that I choose someone as emissary or ambassador like yeah, I'm leaving if anybody asks I fucking boned out like yeah\n\n01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:24.200\nMaybe like somebody yeah, somebody's gonna see me dart out\n\n01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:29.280\nBut yeah, you ever as someone left out saying bye and you've gone like they didn't say bye to me\n\n01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:33.160\nThat was that's a polite way of saying I wonder if anybody ever said where's Jeff\n\n01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:40.800\nWell this happened to me last week someone left but they were at my house and they were like only two people there\n\n01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:44.880\nAnd I won't know what it is. I mean we just like did blank. Just leave\n\n01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.080\nWhile we were hanging in\n\n01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:54.080\nChris McKenna on your writing staff it'll be four people and he'll just evaporate like it\n\n01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:58.440\nHe'll just fucking atomize the Irish goodbye to the to master yes\n\n01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:05.520\nHe has a black belt and fuck like just disappearing acts like but we were all we were mid conversation\n\n01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:11.040\nHe said he went to the he had to go to the bathroom.

Yeah?\n\n01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.560\nLike that's fucked up\n\n01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.680\nIf you're six foot six like he is and you can stand in front of a table and go good night everybody\n\n01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:26.920\nI say do that one don't just fucking crawl under the carpet. He's like leave\n\n01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.480\nOur writers assistant has a shotgun\n\n01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:38.720\nSound effect queued up on his computer literally anytime Mike sure goes anywhere else you hear he plays that sound effect\n\n01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.040\nSo we'll just be like\n\n01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.040\nWork on that and then I'll go into his office\n\n01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.800\nAnd it's funny\n\n01:17:45.800 --> 01:18:01.720\nOh, yeah, I think it's time to we should bring a Spencer. Shouldn't we? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, let's get Spencer\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nHey\n\n01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:13.400\nWe were wondering you when we were in Scotland we were wondering if you would be a kilt type how you would take because you're such a\n\n01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.680\nShort-skye and oh, yeah, I'm all about ventilation. Yeah\n\n01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.520\nDid I ask you\n\n01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:29.600\nSpencer could cotton to the whole thing I could see I could I could see you just putting on a kilt and then and then\n\n01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:33.960\nHaving an epiphany and going like pants are all about limitation of movement\n\n01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:42.160\nHe's wearing jeans tonight. Yeah, I've never seen that before so awkward. I guess those are pajama jeans, right?\n\n01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:50.760\nThat's what my dad wears. He's he is big into like designer jeans. He's like touch them. They're like pajamas\n\n01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.080\nCan I tell you this? This is what happened to my dad\n\n01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:59.960\nLast week in his house. He fell down. This is not a happy story. It's just a crazy story broke his arm\n\n01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.120\nHe's 58. He's young broke his arm between his shoulder and his elbow broke it\n\n01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:09.720\nBut it was a blizzard. So he's been sitting at home for four days. What with a broken arm and\n\n01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:15.200\nIt's like a fucking zombie movie. He's like, you know, I'm just sitting here eating a lot of Tylenol extras\n\n01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:20.160\nAnd that's what he's been doing for like five days. Well, he can't get out to go to a doctor\n\n01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:25.200\nYeah, he can't get out to go to a doctor. Where'd he live? The Jersey? It's like a foot of snow outside\n\n01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:31.040\nYeah, he's just there with a fucked up arm. He's just like he gets up in the morning 127 hour situation. Yeah\n\n01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.920\nTomorrow you might not have an arm or a dad\n\n01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:43.240\nIt's joking. He's fine. He's doing great. Right. There's that there's that one scenario where he just chews off the rest of his body\n\n01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.240\nJust leaves you\n\n01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.720\nWhere's dad?\n\n01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:56.360\nIs most of that movie spent with James Franco in the hole or is most of it like flashbacks to how he ended up in the hole\n\n01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.360\nMost is with the rock before he gets there\n\n01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.120\nDwayne The Rock Johnson\n\n01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.800\nI thought you were saying it's the whole geological history of that rock\n\n01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.840\nIt's this thing of like 500,000 years of\n\n01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.840\nYeah, Morgan Freeman comes over the voiceover\n\n01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:15.360\nWhen I was 10, I always wondered how rocks were\n\n01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:18.880\nFranco parts of the blip on the radar of that rock\n\n01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:25.120\nThe clock I'm not I'm not I'm never gonna watch that movie. That's not that's why would you?\n\n01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:30.200\nIt's great, but it's a guy in isolation. Isn't that heaven Dan? No, and to be clear\n\n01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:34.280\nI mean I've I've nobody's more lonely than me and nobody reacts for poorly in isolation than me\n\n01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:38.600\nBut as a kid I was just like, you know, I was very very relieved to get some time alone\n\n01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:42.680\nI just didn't I just didn't want to walk away from that conversation\n\n01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.680\nWithout having clarified that\n\n01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:52.320\nBut then Dan like so like how does being an like on stage with a microphone in front of a group of people?\n\n01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:56.040\nBecause that's how does that compare is that heaven or hell or both or like well\n\n01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.560\nIt's it's heaven because I get to get to talk to people\n\n01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:05.800\nBut I've got I got personal space around me and no one's like with the exception of Adam Goldberg talking back\n\n01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:13.360\nNo, I like that the pit, you know, so when our crowd here sometimes people come come up and whatever it's it's it's\n\n01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:20.640\nIt's it's more it feels more honest to me because I feel like when you meet someone on a street corner\n\n01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:27.200\nThere's this performance element to it that that feels dishonest because you're on a street corner\n\n01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:33.520\nBut that's well, but that's all about being authentic. I mean, that's what you end up trying to struggle with I do\n\n01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.000\nYou know, I thought I was thinking am I being full of shit here?\n\n01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.560\nI might you know my am I trying to be am I trying to be likable much? I get very self-conscious about that\n\n01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:47.200\nAnd you can get past that almost like you do on stage really which is just kind of making it about them\n\n01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.720\nYeah, but I don't I mean well up\n\n01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.840\nI guess that's where the bad habit comes in because up here\n\n01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:56.760\nI'm allowed to make it all about me and what I need to do is try to form if I'm serious about wanting to change\n\n01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:02.460\nI try to form new synapses in my brain where I care about the other people where I'm like listening and like\n\n01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:10.260\nYou know when you were traveling like for me heaven is being in a new city a new country and meeting like and learning that\n\n01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:14.940\nLike like learning new things about different cultures, but you find out everybody's the same\n\n01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:19.380\nBut like people are people and wherever you go and that's like the most rewarding thing in the world\n\n01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:25.300\nSo I have heaven for me is a stranger at a bar like the most interesting person is always the stranger sitting next to you for me\n\n01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:31.820\nThat's my heaven, but that's totally opposite of you. Probably Dan like a like you're you're way more insular when you when you travel\n\n01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:34.300\nyeah, and\n\n01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:40.140\nYou also said you don't like traveling to countries where they don't speak English that that's that's that's hard on you, right?\n\n01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:45.060\nYeah, I mean you just feel inadequate, right? I feel inadequate. I feel like I'm so sorry\n\n01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:48.260\nI don't speak your language. I feel like I should apologize for it all the time\n\n01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:52.740\nYeah, I can barely understand the Scottish and the Irish and that's all I can do to try to keep up\n\n01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:55.420\nI can't I can't I can't understand half of you guys\n\n01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:58.700\nI'm all I'm all I did you pointed me when you said\n\n01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:08.460\nI'm always in America. I'm constantly going what what what what I don't know if I'm hard of hearing or I think it's more like\n\n01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:11.260\nI'm so fucking overwhelmed when someone's talking to me that I I\n\n01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:15.140\nCan't I got a I got a buffer it and like digest it or something\n\n01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:19.860\nSo yeah, I fucking Paris was a goddamn beyond a nightmare\n\n01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:23.180\nIt was just I just had to switch off and just be like soon. We'll be out of Paris\n\n01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:27.100\nI don't I was just I just I don't know what to do\n\n01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:30.260\nI I don't want to be the guy that refuses to try to speak French\n\n01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:34.100\nSo I'll try to speak French and order fucking up. I guess I ordered the boot\n\n01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:38.220\nI'll eat the boot. I'm eating the boot mayor see mayor see\n\n01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:41.060\nWhy is the boot on the menu?\n\n01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:44.820\nJust there for a test at a restaurant\n\n01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:53.420\nAre we eating at a shoe store? They have a menu\n\n01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:57.180\nSo they call it Zara here too\n\n01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:04.740\nStupid that's been sir. There's a guy in a corner cutting up a boot.

I'm not on my own\n\n01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:09.300\nI did acid at Joshua tree and I was sitting on a rock\n\n01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:11.980\nthose big round rocks and\n\n01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:15.100\nI don't like snakes like when I'm not on acid and\n\n01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:18.420\nBut on acid\n\n01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:24.260\nI was sitting on a rock and I didn't I did like a tiny but I wasn't really really really tripping\n\n01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:29.500\nBut I was I was I was on acid. I was high and I heard just like the bugs are going\n\n01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:34.740\nLooking at a rock. It was like a face. I went there sober the next day. It still looked like a face by the way\n\n01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:38.260\nYou didn't have to be on acid to see a face in this rock\n\n01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:40.260\nBut I was just sitting there like\n\n01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:47.900\nMy friend Mark Rivers comes up with a big like heavy-duty like the flashlight was giant like lantern ones\n\n01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:53.900\nYeah, hey, man, you're bobbin me out with your lights man.

The buzzing was a fucking rattlesnake\n\n01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:03.260\nHe was sitting right next to you good\n\n01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:09.100\nI'd been there for an hour listening to that and I look at me like hey, buddy\n\n01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:15.780\nThe next day I was not on acid and I was looking over both shoulders my jeans tucked into my shoes like it was fucking\n\n01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:18.780\nI think the snakes and Joshua tree are probably used\n\n01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:31.580\nBut if you're gonna do a listen to Jen's Joshua trees in place place\n\n01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:37.540\nI did it Madison Square Garden last week and it was great for what acid fish. Yeah, you wait\n\n01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:40.380\nYou didn't ask it acid at a fish fish is still a bent\n\n01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:44.500\nDon't don't Paris. This is like his fucking thing, dude\n\n01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:49.740\nYeah, yeah, I did almost get into my first fight at a fish show ever out of like 90 shows\n\n01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:53.780\nWe're like what would a fish fight me about it's like a big\n\n01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:02.380\nIt's hacky what this fight was about but there was a guy who was on ketamine special K\n\n01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:09.100\nWhen you're on K, you're like base position is like leaning back and you're bumping into everyone and I kind of you\n\n01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:13.100\nIt's just known that you kind of push gently push him off you when he goes and bumps in the next person\n\n01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:18.260\nYeah, that's no that's his night, but I just I gently pushed him and I feel these two arms wrap around me\n\n01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:21.820\nHe's thick arms. He's like don't fucking push him. That's my son\n\n01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.620\nKetamine guys dad Papa K\n\n01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:37.140\nPapa K and he he wouldn't let go and he was like he's just drunk. I was like he hasn't been drinking all night\n\n01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:44.060\nHe's on ketamine. I know what that is. He's done a terrible job\n\n01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:47.500\nAnd he said if I let go don't fucking push him\n\n01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:54.420\nI said let go me right now let go me and he's not letting go my friend who weighs probably 300 pounds\n\n01:27:54.420 --> 01:28:00.140\nIt's very large man finally sees this happening. He's on acid too, and he just bowls both of us over\n\n01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:07.460\nCharges at us he takes you down, too. He yeah, he was like he's tripping. I was like I appreciate just\n\n01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:13.460\nFucking breaking up the whole situation. He aimed for him, but I got a little baby with the bath water\n\n01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:15.460\nYeah, and then\n\n01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:22.460\nThe guy he my friend standing between us as this guy and I'm on acid and and it's very scary when this is being yelled at\n\n01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:30.180\nYou he's like you don't know the rage of a father. I\n\n01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:36.260\nGot took I got took\n\n01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:40.580\nWhat do you think was he on anything he must have been on something that's that's very\n\n01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:47.260\nI don't know what I saw and this kid does some K and then they go to fish together\n\n01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:53.660\nBut for the rest of the night he was holding his son up from his belt hoop this kid was like 23 or something\n\n01:28:53.660 --> 01:29:00.100\nSo it's a very weird dynamic. That's fucking weird. Have you really been to 90 fish concerts? Yeah, roughly. Yeah\n\n01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:06.620\nDo you like follow them around like is it like you go on tours with them?

I'd love that\n\n01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:30.340\nMost likely Bob you having to do drugs and go to a fish show fucking that is what Scott didn't deal\n\n01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:36.300\nI mean like yeah, it sounds great. I mean the old joke about Grateful Dead is what a Grateful Dead fans say when the drugs were off\n\n01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:40.340\nWhat the fuck are we listening to? I think Grateful Dead is horrible\n\n01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:47.060\nI don't say yeah fish. I don't know fish. All I know about fish is that any girl I ever dated that a fish bumper sticker was a bummer\n\n01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.500\nShe might have been a born again Christian, you know\n\n01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:04.180\nConnected those dots I feel like that you wrote that weeks ago. We're hoping that was amazing\n\n01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:11.140\nI have only met you twice on the show and I've come to hate you for how fucking funny you are\n\n01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:15.300\nWell, have you seen the rest of development? You should have hated him years ago\n\n01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:21.820\nI just assumed that was a factory of geniuses. It turns out it's just one lunatic who's charming and funny as hell\n\n01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:27.340\nLike yeah, he's just like you have one liner. It's just like you're like what do you know? I'm not gonna make funnier for that\n\n01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:29.340\nSo\n\n01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:39.620\nHow do we how do we play Dungeons & Dragons Spencer?

I mean, it's something you get from supplantation\n\n01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:29.940\nThat's why it's funny Jesus who said it. Well, he jumped on the supplantation. Yeah, the supplantation was great\n\n01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.500\nThat's what he said\n\n01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:36.500\nI didn't like it the first time\n\n01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:41.420\nSpencer break it down for us.

They murdered him\n\n01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:12.700\nIntentionally activating a massive golem down but not out sharpie became a gas and entered the golems\n\n01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:20.300\nWorking with the gang attacking the metal monster from both the outside and in and with some timely help from a venture\n\n01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:25.580\nThe Hawk they eventually managed to decapitate and deactivate the arcane machine\n\n01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:33.500\nBut Christopher took turn for the worst vomiting on and grabbing a strange glowing stone from inside the golem as well as\n\n01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:35.500\nOnto doors and such\n\n01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:41.220\nTogether Chris and more a knock the golem all down and then Christopher began to vomit some more\n\n01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:49.380\nAfter realizing their exit was blocked by lava Sharpie left from the window of a several hundred foot tall spire\n\n01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:53.460\nProtected with the feather fall, but leaving his allies high and dry\n\n01:32:53.460 --> 01:33:00.740\nLuckily the savvy rogue acted quickly lassoing Sharpie with his rope and reeling him in so the party could escape together\n\n01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:05.660\nBut as the realization of their valiant deeds began to settle over our heroes\n\n01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:10.620\nChristopher broke the strange tension by strangely and without provocation\n\n01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:14.300\nDrying his dagger and deep boning his own crotch\n\n01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:18.900\nSending the dismembered member onto the snowy cold ground\n\n01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:25.060\nAs blood poured out into the snow the phallus suffered from high-speed shrinkage\n\n01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:31.420\nBut why and what now and Christopher you lose two charisma points\n\n01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:41.460\nWait, I don't want to\n\n01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:44.480\nCan we not have fucking Duncan trustal\n\n01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:46.480\nI\n\n01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:51.860\nSo my dick is gone and I've lost two charisma\n\n01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:59.240\nYeah, until such time as it can be reattached and restored it's laying in the snow, but you cut your dick off\n\n01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:01.240\nYou lose two charisma points\n\n01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:04.240\nIt's a house roll.

I\n\n01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:17.260\nKnow that your subtle implication is that everything that's happening to us we deserve\n\n01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:25.900\nBut it's it's not easy to play Dungeons & Dragons, it's like it's like, you know, you make weird decisions\n\n01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:30.340\nI\n\n01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:34.860\nI I'm thinking I'll use my teleport cape.
