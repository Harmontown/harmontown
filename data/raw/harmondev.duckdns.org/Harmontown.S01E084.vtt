00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Tarot audio.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Music plays

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Woo!

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Music plays

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
I'm on my way from Mexico to Japan

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Music plays

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
I'm on my way from Mexico to Japan

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Just good booze.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Hello everybody, welcome back to Mel J. On Conference

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
in Hollywood, California.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
I trust that your holidays were glorious.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
I know mine was and I know Dan's was.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
We've been to Scotland and Dan was in Ireland,

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
but we're back now with my favorite words.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
I get to say one more time, for the first time in 2014,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Music plays

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
Please welcome to the stage the Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
Applause

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Thank you very much.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Applause

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Thank you for showing up in such numbers.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I didn't even tweet it.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
This is a big event.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
You know, Harmontown live audience members,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
and not the listeners, I'm just saying,

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
the people that show up for the live show,

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
they're very fair weather friends.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Like, they do, they're like,

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
oh, the show's good again, let's go.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Applause

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
You remember when I got hired back, they showed up.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
Right, I mean, I'm less cynical than you maybe.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
I thought this was just because we've been gone for a while.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
This was our triumphant return from the United Kingdom.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Alright, maybe they're good people.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Or, I mean, let's be honest everybody,

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
maybe by a very honest show of applause,

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
who's here simply because community is back up with Dan Harmon?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Yeah, alright, fine.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Okay, three very honest people and 30 liars.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah, I mean, it wouldn't really make sense for that to be the motivation.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
So, you can probably hear from my voice

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
that I'm a little under the weather,

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
I caught some kind of Scottish Ebola in Scotland of all places.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
Edinburgh, who was wonderful,

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
couldn't ask for a more beautiful, welcoming city full of joy and delight,

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
but two guys high-fived my rental kilt,

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
and one of them gave me fucking barbarian herpes.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
This is some old school bubonic, old world microbial fucking...

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
You got sick like the New Year's Day, I think, right?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Yeah, I was like right after Hogmanie,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
which is what they call their New Year's celebration in Edinburgh,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
and I kept to myself that night.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
I didn't even, I had two glasses of cider because my rental shoes were,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
that was the only mistake I made that night.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
I couldn't walk around on these fucking wingtips that I got from the kilt rental place.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
I should have realized that Scottish people aren't going to wear,

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
they're not going to dress fancy for Hogmanie.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
They'll put their kilt on so that their balls can be cooled

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
in the nice night air because it's fun to wear a kilt.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
But they put on their Doc Martens and their Converse and stuff,

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
and they run around the cobblestone streets like pigs.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Wow, wonderful pigs.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm not saying they're pigs.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
I wore my own brogues that night, I brought my own shoes.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
To me, renting shoes is like, that's why I don't bowl.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
That's fucking, that's no good.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
So anyways, the truth is, and I say this without shame,

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
that's not true, but I spent at least 35 minutes of that New Year's Eve on the toilet.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Like I just sat on the toilet in the stall because it's where I could sit down.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Because my shoes hurt so bad.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I was just a sad little wallflower.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
I played my farm game on my phone and everyone in the other room was like,

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
yeah, it was a room full of Popeyes.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
And I touched two people that night that weren't airing.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Also, you were walking around in a pretty chilly Scotland in a kilt.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I don't think that's where illness comes from.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
It comes from other people.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
I don't think it's not, illness doesn't come from cold.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
I was very gregarious and slapped a lot of fives that night.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I didn't get any cold.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
There was one guy I remember, I remember him walking by me and he went,

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
respect!

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
And high five on the way home.

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
And that high five, I think some fucking purple monster leapt from his hand to mine

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
and then jumped into my mouth and laid eggs in my chest.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Jaren is at home right now.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
She's not here.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
You don't think that she wanted to come here and talk about the events of the New Year's Eve.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
She wanted to come here and talk about the events of the holiday.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
That's how bad this fucker is.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
She's sick, too.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Don't applaud Aaron being sick, you assholes.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
That's very rude.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Oh, you mean the new news?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:14.000 --> 05:27.000
I proposed marriage to Erin McGathy and...

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Pressure's off now, man, today.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
I was just machine gun farting in bed, like...

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Because every time I cough, I fart, too.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Wait, but are you saying...

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I'm not doing it on purpose.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I also tip from my...

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Because the cough is loud in my head, so I feel like I got away with it.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
And then I look over and she's like, what the fuck?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
What are you doing?

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
And then you hold that and you point to her ring and you just keep farting?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Yeah.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Are you saying up until the engagement, you've been...

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
You've issued some restraint in that...

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
A couple slipped out.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
No, you guys talk about farting all over each other, don't you?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Like, isn't that a thing?

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
I have farted before, but every time I have, what I've thought is...

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
A bit of merrier.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
So romantic.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
So romantic.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Very romantic.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
That's what love is.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Now, to take the crowd, if you would, Dan, take us through the...

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Now, we get to Scotland.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I thought...

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I did not know for certain that you were going to propose.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I figured you were.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
I felt like that was in the ether.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Kate, my girlfriend, she had talked to you about it.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
She knew, but she didn't tell me.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Well, when Kate and I landed in Scotland, we took different planes,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
but we landed in Scotland within minutes of each other.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
You guys had just gotten there.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
And we landed, and take us through...

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
From the beginning of the Scotland...

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Well, as everyone knows, I'm a big planner.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Like, that's my wheelhouse.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
As the show can testify to.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
They call me Mr. Forsyte.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
They call me Schedule Steve.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
Dan stayed up all night thinking of that character now.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Schedule Steve.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I love that you're a writer.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
So, I thought, let's embrace that idea.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
To marry me is to marry organic chaos.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Not, you know...

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Schedule Steve.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Not an Excel spreadsheet, you know?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Yeah, not Schedule Steve.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Don't truck Dan.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
That's your Marian.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
And I thought, you know what?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
You know what's going to turn out is...

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
It's going to be romantic.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Because, you know, it's not romantic.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
It's stress, and anxiety, and planning, and being outside the moment.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Shoot from the hip, baby.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
And, you know, we're going to be having a great time,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
and I'll just have this ring on me the whole...

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
All the time, and that way, right at the moment.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
This is an idea I got from Jim on the office.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
At the right moment, I will bust it out.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
It'll be perfect.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
So, I have this...

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Now, stop. I'm going to pause you there.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Because this is a question I don't actually know.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Did you think in your head there would be a certain day

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
before Christmas?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
We left on the 21st.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Did you...

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Landing on the 22nd.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Did you think it would be pre-Christmas,

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
maybe over-Christmas, maybe...

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
No, I didn't think about it.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Okay.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
All right.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
No preconceived notions of what day,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
or what would be too late, or too early, or too anything.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
No.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
I mean, I didn't want...

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
I probably didn't want to wait until the last day,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
but I also knew that whatever.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Okay, gotcha.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
All right.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
I got my Kettle One Alliance backpack.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Right.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
Kettle One sent me a backpack when they welcomed me

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
into the alliance.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
And I'm not...

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
The story I'm going to tell you is not...

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
You're going to think that I'm pretending that I had feelings

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
for this backpack.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I really did.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Before this happened, this was the first backpack I've ever had

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
that I was like, that's a cool backpack.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Because that's like, who cares about a backpack?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
This backpack was cool.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
It was a really cool backpack.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
It had a microchip in it that if I lost my backpack,

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
or I assume was kidnapped while drinking Kettle One

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
by Irish whiskey runners or something,

09:22.000 --> 09:29.000
that Kettle One would pair a troop people in and, you know...

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
What is the actual purpose of that microchip?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
It's like a low jack for your backpack,

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
a cracker jack.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
I mean, that might be the quickest we've ever had a title

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
for our episode.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
So, we got a lot of guests tonight,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
so let me rip through this.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
So, we're on the plane.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
What do you call it? The airplane?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Yeah.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Virgin Atlantic has a bar on its plane in first class.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
If there's a bar in any vehicle,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I'm going to spend all my time at it,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
because it's just unprincipled.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
If you had a bar in your car,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
even if it was the least comfortable spot in the car,

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
I'd be like, I'm at a bar in a car!

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
You know, when you get on a train and there's a bar car,

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
and you jam in there, even though it's not going to treat you like shit.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
But there's a little tiny bar in a Virgin Atlantic flight,

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
and I drank for, like, eight hours on the flight.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Erin was starting to feel...

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
She wasn't up to too much drinking,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
and she ate this bacon buddy as we were landing.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
Like, this is a bacon sandwich that they make in Europe, somehow.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
And apparently, it was kind of bad.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
And I got off the plane, like, really at my most charming,

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
because I got this atom bomb in my backpack

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
that is instant happiness,

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
and I just drank on a plane for eight hours,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
and I'm arriving at Heathrow Airport,

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
which is one of the most delightful places you could ever be.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
It's just the joy there is palpable.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
I have a different relationship with that airport.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
No, Heathrow is pretty miserable, but...

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
So we get on this tram, and, well, so far, we're walking through the airport,

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
and I'm just like...

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Meaning you've flown the ten and a half hours, ten hours to London,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
and you have a connector to Edinburgh,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
so you're getting your connecting flight.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
So I'm doing bits, I'm looking at the sign going,

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
oh, that guy looks like you've got antlers,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
and Erin's like, yeah, well, shut up.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
And she went to the bathroom,

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
and I think she said that she vomited in the bathroom, I think,

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
and I'm like, oh, baby, it's a bad bacon buddy, yeah.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
We get on this tram.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Stop.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
What were you going to say?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Nothing.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
You were going to say something?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Meaningless question, go ahead.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
No, I want to know.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Did she throw up on the plane or in the airport?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I think the airport, I can't remember.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
What a dumb question.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Dan, we have a lot of guests, get through this.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
I know.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
It's like, fucking, this is insane.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
And guests that you have to treat right

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
are they fucking fly the coop, man.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Birds on a wire should be the theme of the night.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
We got some humdingers, people that are hard guests.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Tell the story.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
All right.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
So she's looking kind of queasy,

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
and I'm on the tram with her,

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
and I'm still kind of picking and grinning,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
and what does that expression mean?

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
You're a banjo player, apparently.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
But Aaron's not looking too good.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
I start rubbing her back on the tram,

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
and she's like, can you stop rubbing my back?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
And these trams are chock full of people.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
They're jams with people.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Yeah, jammed up.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
A 10-minute tram from one terminal to the other.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Yeah, we're just standing there holding the doohickeys,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
the handles, people, everyone's standing up.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
There's a standing room only.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
We're swaying and moving,

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
and Aaron says, can you please stop rubbing my back?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Which, that's pretty nauseous

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
when someone, you know, comfort is now making you sick.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
So she gets this look on her face

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
at a certain point that is unmistakable,

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
and I instinctively, not consciously,

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
because I loved this backpack.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Instinctively.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Before I knew what I was doing,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
I had muscles in my arms,

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
years of college and bad improv troupe parties,

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
and had muscle memories.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Unzip the first zipper on the backpack,

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
hold it wide open just as she leaned into it,

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
and firehosed probably eight quarts of...

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
What do you call it?

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Vomit into the backpack,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
which again, and this is the poetic tragedy of it,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
it's such a good backpack that it holds it

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
like a waterproof bucket.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
This isn't some jagged off Garfield knapsack

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
that your mom stuck you with.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
This isn't some bullshit for your pencils.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
This thing has a computer in it.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
It's the night writer of backpacks.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
It holds shit, literally,

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
and it's deep, but not a drop hits the floor.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
And by the way, shout out to the Cosmopolitan community

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
at the London Heathrow Airport.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Everybody just totally, not in New York,

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
kind of callous way, nothing against New York.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
You do what you do to survive

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
when somebody has something to happen on a subway.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
But just in this sort of like,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
yeah, we all get it,

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
everyone at London Heathrow is from way somewhere else

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
and has been through all kinds of stuff, I assume.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
And if they haven't,

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
just the environment kind of dictates that you feel that way.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
There was no gawking and there was no chiding

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
and there was no, a couple of people moved away

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
out of politeness.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
And then one guy was standing right next to me

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
right at the end of it, like a real subtle move,

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
just pulls out a little disposable Kleenex pack

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
and offers it to Erin and she says thank you

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
and dabs her thing and the tram stops

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
and I've got a backpack full of vomit

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
and now I realize my house key is in there.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
My iPad mini is in there.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
And the ring.

15:28.000 --> 15:36.000
So we get off the tram and we go to a bathroom.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
In situations like this where you find out there are bathrooms

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
where you never would have known there was a bathroom,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I don't think anyone had been to this bathroom.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
If you're at the grocery store and you have to pee all of a sudden

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
you're in some weird bathroom next to the eggs.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Because I had a backpack full of puke,

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
I found a long lost bathroom at Heathrow Airport

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
under a stairway or something.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
And I open it up and it's, you use your own imagination.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
But it's like, and I'm going like,

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Erin's in the women's room, she's like,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
she's going are you all right?

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
And I'm like yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm in a stall

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
and I'm like fuck, fuck.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I can hear her, she's calling out to me.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
And I know where the house key is.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
And it's six feet down, you know?

16:21.000 --> 16:29.000
And I'm just like, fuck.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
I just got to thrust my hand in and pull out the key

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
and put that down on the top of the toilet paper

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
just in front of the chair.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
I'm like okay, now we got to find my precious.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
And we can be certain that in there, part of it is a bad bacon buddy.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
As a bacon roll, like yeah, it's not good.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
She didn't just have cream of wheat.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
It's bad news then.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
What is this?

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
Spike and Mike's Twisted Animation Festival?

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
You want to talk about the puke?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I'm just trying to paint a picture.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Were there carrots in it?

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
That's not Ed McMahon territory.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Don't tell me how to be a comptroller.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
Everyone in the room could fill in their own puke blanks

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
about the actual substance.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
In the history of the earth, there's never been pleasant vomit.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
What does he have for breakfast?

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
So then I reach in and I get out the ring box.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
I rinse everything off and she can hear me going fuck, fuck, fuck.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
She thinks I'm just mad at her for ruining the backpack

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
but of course I'm mad because I'm getting puke all over my hands

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
because there's stuff in there.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Also, I'm kind of thinking in my head,

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
well now, even if I fuck up the proposal, there's still a story.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
So it was kind of a good thing.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I remember in my head thinking this is actually working out

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
except I'm losing the backpack.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
And I know for sure, he threw up a airport of all places

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
to put a, just take a backpack, a brand new backpack

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
and there was one tiny trash can that was smaller than the backpack

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
and I just kind of tried to get it in there but just left it.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Can you imagine after I got out of whatever plane,

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
there must have been like a bomb squad for sure,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
like circling this thing.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Two, three, go, go, go, give me a report.

18:20.000 --> 18:27.000
And then the guy comes up and opens it and goes like, ugh.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
So that happened and then I proposed on the muddy banks of the Loch Ness lock.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Yeah.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
But the puke, that's the story.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
The story, yeah.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Because I fucked up, I kept walking around with the ring.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
So because I'm walking around with this ring,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
because I'm burdened with creating this special moment,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
I'm just burdened, I'm putting it on myself.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
The dumbest thing I could have done, it turns out.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
All the anxiety, all of the stress,

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
if I had just planned something,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I could have just spent the rest of the time,

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
put the ring on top of the dresser at the hotel room

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
or arrange with Kate to have her hold it.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
I could have done a million things to just relax during the trip,

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
but because I want to play it organic and be Jim from the office,

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
I'm walking around with this lump in my pocket

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
and every time Aaron tries to hold my hand in a certain way,

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
put it in my pocket, I'm like slapping her hand away.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
She's like, this is the worst trip ever.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
A boyfriend hates me.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
There was one time when she started rubbing my thigh

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
in the backseat of the car, and at that point,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
that morning I had gone, you know what, fuck the box.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
The box probably still has puke on it.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
It's really hard to hide.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
It's a giant box.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
I'm just going to take the ring and carry it around in my pocket.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
And then Aaron started rubbing my thigh in the back of the car

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
very romantically, and I grabbed her hand,

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
like all aspergery, like grabbed her hand,

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
and you're like, is this what you want?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
You want me to hold your hand?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Is that why you're rubbing it on me?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
And she just looked at me, and I don't know,

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
what can you say?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
What can you do?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Then I went to dinner with her.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I was like, okay, let's do a nice dinner.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
This is our first night in Edinburgh, right?

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
We go to a decent place, but it's too shitty and cheesy.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
It's like a TGA Fridays.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I'm not going to propose to her here.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
But Aaron's bringing these presents,

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
and somehow the lie became that I had a present for her.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
But this is after Christmas.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Christmas had already passed at this point.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
We're back in Edinburgh.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Yes, so she's anxious, but she hadn't given me her.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
My Christmas present chat.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I don't have any Christmas presents for her.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
All I have is a ring.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
But you said we're going to do our presents later,

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
because you didn't exchange presents on Christmas Eve

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
or Christmas because of this?

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
I didn't plan anything.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
I said at one point, every time Christmas presents came up,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
I was like, we don't have to do that now.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
There was never a good time to open presents.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
This is not an important part of the conversation.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I would have gone with Christmas.

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
Seems like a good time for presents.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
So we go to a restaurant, and then I'm getting mad at her

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
because she's trying to give me Christmas presents.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
I'm like, can't we do that later?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And she's like, no, I really want to do it now.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And I rip open one, and it's like a keychain finder.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
And I'm like, well, we're going to do this again.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
Because we already tried this, and these things don't work.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
And she's like, what?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Why am I sorry I got you Christmas presents?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
And I'm like, I don't know.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
What's the next one?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
HD spy camera pen?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Fuck off.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Check, please.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Let's just get out of here.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
And she's like, what is happening?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
What is going on?

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
I don't know.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
I don't know.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
You know what it sounds like to me?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
It sounds like you became Schedule Steve.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Yeah.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Yeah.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I atoned with that.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
So we went out walking in the night air at that boat.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I was like, OK, this time I'm going to do it.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
We had a nice walk.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
You guys went into the restaurant.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
I'm like, I'm going to talk to Erin over here.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
And I took her.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
It was pitch black, so I'm squishing around on the mud.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
It was absolute darkness on the bank.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
The next day, we would see that 30 yards away,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
there was a perfect spot to propose.

22:10.000 --> 22:15.000
OK, there was a place designed to feed Nessie out of your hand

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
where swans would circle you and hummingbirds would pick

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
the wax out of your ears.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
I did it by the wood chipper.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
There really was a couple of fallen trees and a tractor.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
Like a sign for iron brew or something.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
A broken fence.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
It doesn't matter, because I'm a catch.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
So my proposal doesn't have to be amazing.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
My marriage will be amazing.

22:46.000 --> 22:53.000
All right, let's get our cavalcade of guests up here.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Wait real quick, real quick.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
Before we do, what did she say?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
She's going to do it.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
She's going to give it a shot.

22:59.000 --> 23:04.000
All right, let's bring out our guests.

23:04.000 --> 23:26.000
Let's bring Mitch Hurwitz up first.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
From back there, it almost sounded as if you brought Jeff

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
with you to propose to your girlfriend.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Is that at all possible?

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
I did kind of.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Why were you together?

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
What was the plan?

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
We're inseparable.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
No, we had planned a long time ago to go on this Scottish vacation

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
together for the holidays as a...

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
It's really weird.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Would you ever travel with my family?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Would you ever be game for that?

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
I actually have.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
We were in St. Martin together a couple of years ago.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
That's why I know you.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
Have you already proposed to your wife, Mitch?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Because Jeff's got some pointers.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
I have, unfortunately.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
Wait, what's that about?

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
You told me I should have done it on Christmas.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
No, I opened the gifts on Christmas.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Oh, open the gifts on Christmas?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I thought you said I would have done it on Christmas.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
I would have proposed it on Christmas.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
You said there's no good time to open the gifts.

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
I proposed to my wife on Hanukkah, so it was like an eight day.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
I serialized it.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
She kind of saw it coming around day six.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
I kept saying, you'll see.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
No presents.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
Any advice for newlyweds?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Oh, newlyweds.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
You know, it's funny.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
I was in New York.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
I have a very good friend who works at the Kettle One

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
backpack tracking center.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
And just for fun, I said, bring up Dan Harmon.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
And we went off of the grid, apparently, somewhere in Heathrow.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
We lost you.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
We couldn't figure out why.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
Yeah, that backpack is now deep under whatever the MI6.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Yeah, our guys went out there and they couldn't find it.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
But we picked you up with a keychain tracker.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
We got you in Scotland.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
Dan, why weren't you pleased with the spy pen?

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Did she give you a spy pen camera?

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
I was in a tailspin because I didn't know when to propose

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
to my girlfriend and how to do it.

25:35.000 --> 25:42.000
And was now, somehow, I had brought this jam box, OK?

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
I re-gifted the jam box because I was just going to,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
so I would have a Christmas gift.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
We were going to exchange Christmas gifts in Scotland.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
Well, she puked on the jam box, too.

25:54.000 --> 26:00.000
And after the puking thing, I gave her the jam box and said,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
well, here, you carry this now.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
That's your Christmas present.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
Because I had no backpack anymore.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
There was no more way to walk around with all my little ruses

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
and a little Willy Wonka trick bag.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Were you nervous?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I got very nervous before I proposed.

26:18.000 --> 26:24.000
And my whole plan was, well, actually, I kind of,

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
I ended up, I was halfway through a metaphor.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
And I realized I had to abandon it.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
But it's a better story if I didn't, which was that I started to say,

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
like, I really started to think, like, you know,

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
sometimes you have to shit or get off the pod.

26:38.000 --> 26:45.000
I'd like to take that shit with you.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
Really almost. And actually, I remembered thinking,

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
you know, this, we've been in this relationship for a long time,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
and she understands that this has been hard for me.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to say,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
this is a ring just to get us started.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Just totally misguided, you know.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
But it was going to be, this will just kind of, you know,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
and then we'll experience what it's like to be

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
and we'll take our time and we'll see if it,

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
and then, of course, when I was there and proposing,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
it just, it all tumbled out.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
I want to have children with you.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
I want my children to look like you.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
I want you in my life forever.

27:17.000 --> 27:22.000
I, when I, I just, if that's a waterfall,

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
mine was just a fucking gridlock.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
I just, and I ended up, like, the part of the gridlock

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
that was moving, the John McClain that got out of one car

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
and walked along the roofs, was me talking about the ring

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
and being like, oh, I wanted to get the one you wanted,

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
but that's the shopping.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
I'm like, I haven't asked you to marry me yet

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
and I'm like fucking talking about the fucking ring

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
of idiot, idiot, idiot.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Yeah, and then you get the proposal out and you realize,

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
oh, wait, there's another step.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
You do kind of feel like, ah, that's done.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
Oh, and you're, are you game or do you want to,

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
you want to assume, I assume.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
Yeah, I fucked up and I fucked up,

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
but it's okay because I'm a fuck up.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Why not?

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
This is, and I think, you know, first of all,

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
the first wives are, well, I don't want to say that.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
No, they have to, they understand that the, you know.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
But they, I think it's fantastic.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
I really do.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
It's the second wife that really gets the,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
that really, that scoreboard at the stadium.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Where did the music come from?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
I talked to the guy.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
I know the guy.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
This isn't my first time on the rodeo, honey.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Will you marry me?

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
But in the middle of an actual...

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Abracadabra!

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
How did you get the rodeo clowns to stop?

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
I know everybody here.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
How did you, how did you fit the ring in your penis?

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
And have it come out?

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
Well, I, I, apparently, that this might be apocryphal,

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
but we, you might know this comedy writer

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
who proposed to someone by putting that up as Anus.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
What?

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Yeah.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
And said, I think in the chat, Dino?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Dino's first husband.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
No, I, I can't, I can't...

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
Well, this doesn't go any further.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
No, I, I can't, I can't, I can't.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
What is his name where I'm with?

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Maybe we better bring him out.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Harris Wittels is here tonight.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
Good.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Hi, hello.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
If you wanna, if you, if you wanna pretend it's not you, that's fine.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
I thought that was Urban Legend, but that's true.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Yeah, you know who it is?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Yeah.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Yeah.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
I think it's true.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Well, what was the, within the Urban Legend,

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
what is the motivation?

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Was it humor or sexual?

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
It was humor.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Yeah, like, aren't I interesting?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
And, and you know...

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Apparently...

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
And she apparently didn't see it as a warning, a big warning.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
It's good.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Young ladies, please.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
You don't need this much interesting in your life.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
It's a good final test.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Is this writer still alive?

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Yes.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Okay.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Yes.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I mean, there was some, some anal hemorrhage.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
That's what you're asking?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Yeah.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
There was some internal bleeding.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
I mean...

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
It's a diamond ring.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Was it?

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Was it?

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
I guess my question is, was it square cut, marquee, pear?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
What, what, what?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
I think it was missing a baguette when it came.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I don't know.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Ugh.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
I feel like shit.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
Do you guys want to talk about something funny for me?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Do you feel bad?

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Do you feel...

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
I feel terrible.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
I told, I got Scottish, like, I don't know what the hell you'd call it.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
I woke up the day after New Year's and it was like, like that, that, that, that cold,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
sharp, like little feeling in your chest.

30:46.000 --> 30:51.000
And you can just feel it, like, like, exponentially, like, spreading.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
You know, this is going to be a doozy.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
And then Aaron kept, I'm going to throw her under the bus because she's not here.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Let's have kids.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Because she's so fucking sick.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
And when are we going to buy a house together?

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
I started saying, like, I could feel something bad coming out.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
And she's like, knock it off.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Just, just say you're not sick.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Save it till you get home.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
And I'm like, this isn't one of those.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
This is like a thing.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
And now she's, so, I love you honey.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
Sitting at home right now with her.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
She's got it too.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Yeah.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
She, she, she, when we got to Ireland, she, she woke up the next day and was like,

31:22.000 --> 31:29.000
And I was, I was like, boo, yeah.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
My legs hurt from basketball.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Yeah.

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
Do you, do you, do you, are you one of these guys that plays with Garry Shandling?

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
No, I wanted to be, I was invited by someone, by someone that we know.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
And I thought, and she was like, it's, it's comics.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
It'll be fun.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
I was immediately worried that I was going to have to be very funny during this game.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
That's what I was worried about.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
But then I got there and no one was joking around and everyone was very mad at me for not,

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
it was full court.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
They're like, you fucking get back on D.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
And I was like, I thought this was fun.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I thought we were comics.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
What are we doing?

32:03.000 --> 32:11.000
I can't, I can't get back on D.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
So I quit.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
I just walked off it.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
You did really?

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Did you?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
I was like, I can't, I can't keep up with you guys there.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
It's like comedy store guys.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
So they're good looking and funny.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
Yeah.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
The comedy store guys are legidarily handsome.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
The new breed of comedy store comic is, yeah.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
I think they fall in like, they ain't cooked.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Right.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
Cause they had to have a Myspace profile with a shirt off or something.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
So they are very good looking.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Yeah.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
The comic's was Dom, was Dama Rara there?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
That's what I'm talking about.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
And he's the guy that stuck the wedding ring in his ass.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
This is not.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
No, it's not.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
It's not.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
It doesn't sound like the tallest team.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
It was, yeah.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
They were all, I was shocking.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
It was like they, it was ringers from, like, Space Jam.

32:59.000 --> 33:06.000
I don't, I don't understand that, that, that I don't, I don't know if I'm jealous or resentful

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
or angry or intimidated.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.040
I thought for once I'm gonna not only do drugs on the weekend

33:12.040 --> 33:17.880
Right, and I'm gonna go play basketball, and I was like this is why I chose my path

33:20.280 --> 33:24.240
Yeah, I sports I mean fuck you yeah fuck you

33:24.880 --> 33:30.720
Like like sports has anyone in this room ever lived longer by playing sports? No

33:32.000 --> 33:33.360
No

33:33.360 --> 33:37.280
There is nobody point. They're all exactly the age they are

33:42.680 --> 33:49.820
Do you think by now we would have fit really legitimately figured out like like like like if that if you dribbled a basketball

33:50.160 --> 33:58.440
More than another guy that you're fucking here. Do you still get the cancers in the has anybody here died of cancer because of sports?

33:58.440 --> 34:00.440
Nobody

34:01.640 --> 34:06.520
It's just it's pretty random man like my family's a bunch of hillbillies, you know

34:06.520 --> 34:09.440
They they they just live random distances

34:10.440 --> 34:16.440
Murder each other it really is because because guys in in utero are flooded with testosterone

34:16.440 --> 34:23.540
We don't develop like I was just reading something about how women check little girls check faces all the time and boys don't

34:23.540 --> 34:27.980
No, yeah, yeah, we're not so do you think do you think if I played sports that I would

34:28.260 --> 34:30.940
Because I played softball for the starburn softball team

34:30.940 --> 34:34.300
Maybe I did do you think do you think that I would I would yell less

34:34.300 --> 34:40.660
I would like get I would have less did you really believe that you can channel like a certain amount of rage

34:41.340 --> 34:48.220
Energy, I think you'd be I think you'd be less funny. I think you know what I mean. I think you would I think it would come out

34:49.020 --> 34:51.020
You're funny though

34:51.020 --> 34:57.020
Yeah, we walked off probably don't play you don't play I play drums and people are like that's where you get your age out

34:57.020 --> 35:01.420
But it's like that has nothing to do with that and also musicians are all assholes, too

35:02.340 --> 35:04.900
Everyone stays angry always. I guess is my point

35:07.340 --> 35:09.940
Was there anybody on the court you don't have to name names

35:09.940 --> 35:14.100
But was there anybody that was a really good basketball player and also somebody you thought was very funny

35:15.020 --> 35:17.860
It was no because it was a lot of like newer calm

35:17.860 --> 35:22.060
That's not an insult. I just haven't seen a lot. I don't hang out at the store a lot. So it was a lot of guys comics

35:22.060 --> 35:24.060
I haven't seen the store

35:26.380 --> 35:31.420
It's like it's like a fashion runway now over at the store. Yeah, it's not being about the jokes

35:31.420 --> 35:35.900
It's just about the fun. It's about how you look. Yeah. Yeah, it's just just beefcake comedy

35:35.900 --> 35:38.340
They should call it the they should call it the beefcake store

35:39.620 --> 35:43.060
Hey, so what do you what's the plan? We kind of buried the lead here

35:43.060 --> 35:45.860
What are you gonna do about the wedding and what are you thinking about that?

35:45.860 --> 35:50.980
I don't know. We've been having no, no, we haven't set a date. We have to have a preliminary discussion about

35:52.380 --> 35:58.620
About you know first thing I got to rule out is the possibility of a truly conceptual wedding

35:58.860 --> 36:02.420
Because if we're gonna have one of those then you know, maybe equipment needs to be commissioned

36:02.420 --> 36:08.060
Yeah, isn't the point of an engagement that you can push off having to think about the wedding for a while

36:08.060 --> 36:10.060
That's what I thought it was

36:10.060 --> 36:14.660
Hey, we're engaged. We don't have to get married. I think you got to start a long time. I think you got to start uh, I

36:15.660 --> 36:22.140
Don't know looking at stuff pretty quickly. You should have a community themed wedding, but make it about the port and Weissman year

36:25.940 --> 36:27.940
Grosso, sorry. Yeah

36:29.500 --> 36:31.740
Just everything from that year

36:31.740 --> 36:38.860
Yeah, well I just you know you can say well I just seemed arrogant to make it about my own yeah

36:40.340 --> 36:42.340
But I've got all these great contacts

36:44.020 --> 36:48.380
Dan will work on the show. Were you saying that you said you want to rule out a high concept wedding?

36:48.380 --> 36:53.260
No, I'm saying like that's the first thing that needs to be eliminated before we say book us your

36:53.500 --> 36:56.460
Nice place to get married. That's just a pretty place to get married

36:56.460 --> 37:02.140
I first all want to continue to talk to Aaron. We're workshopping in conversations about hydraulics and things

37:02.740 --> 37:07.220
You know, we may need to rent an airplane hangar if we want to do something special

37:07.220 --> 37:12.140
Whoo, and then you're there a big celebrity doesn't show up and you get like Terry Bradshaw. Yeah

37:15.420 --> 37:19.500
Everybody I know has ever done a show have you been on a show where you I just heard that he is

37:19.500 --> 37:27.260
Booked on my friend show. Yeah, I my friend Lou Schneider years ago worked on Raymond and everybody was Raymond

37:27.260 --> 37:30.780
And he said to me we're getting Michael Jordan. I said great. Say hi to Terry Bradshaw

37:32.300 --> 37:34.300
Two weeks later, and he said you're not gonna believe he's on stage

37:36.100 --> 37:41.820
Terry Bradshaw you actually called it. Yeah, I like doing that with not recently but older McConaughey movies

37:41.820 --> 37:44.700
Or I'm like I wonder who they went who were the first four guys

37:44.700 --> 37:46.700
I

37:49.140 --> 37:55.780
Booked two jobs at least maybe three when the guy because a lot of people have to pass before I get a job and

37:57.020 --> 38:00.500
What's his name of the the quarterback from Jerry McGuire?

38:02.940 --> 38:04.940
No, no Jerry McConnell

38:05.820 --> 38:06.820
push-lash

38:06.820 --> 38:10.240
When Jerry McConnell passes, that's when I have start having a chance

38:10.240 --> 38:12.240
Jerry

38:13.040 --> 38:19.800
Whatever the fuck is easy be trained now is he used to do the show Jerry O'Connell. I didn't do it. No. No, no, sorry

38:44.600 --> 38:50.360
The Emmy Awards it just ended up like about the creative arts Emmys and I was just walking around with him and he was

38:50.640 --> 38:55.720
Have you ever met him? No, but we're just walking on these old railroad tracks

38:55.720 --> 39:01.000
Yeah, you want to see a body that wasn't you

39:01.880 --> 39:03.880
We all think we were doing that

39:04.400 --> 39:09.400

39:21.920 --> 39:24.160
It's such a terrible terrible like a real yeah

39:24.160 --> 39:28.120
I know we all were in the room together. I forgot that Jerry O'Connell was in that motherfucker, too

39:31.240 --> 39:38.120
I was so far I was not in any place to be in that movie Jeff also auditioned for the part

39:38.440 --> 39:43.800
In Monster Squad you you you read the line. Oh, yeah, I was watching Monster Squad

39:43.800 --> 39:48.320
I remember seeing the movie like this sounds to me. I read the line wolf man has nerds

39:48.920 --> 39:50.920
That was in the audition

39:50.920 --> 39:56.520
That's why you didn't get the part because of the line is wolf man's got nerds, but you were like well the wolf man has marks

39:58.560 --> 40:00.560
Yes, I used to be from Transylvania

40:02.440 --> 40:04.920
I have terrible heartburn. Let's bring out Kumail Nanjiani

40:13.920 --> 40:18.000
There's there's too many celebrities on this stage right now. Yeah, yeah

40:18.000 --> 40:24.680
Oh, this is ruining the podcast for me. I listen I every episode. I think yeah, I can't listen to this one now

40:24.680 --> 40:28.120
What's one week is fucked because I'm in it like once you're here

40:32.720 --> 40:35.560
You're getting a lot of comments or attitude right now

40:36.240 --> 40:39.640
It's like Camille's here that Russian guy is probably here

40:41.320 --> 40:42.840
It's like Oz

40:42.840 --> 40:46.720
Yeah, no, I can't listen to it because I well when I'm on it

40:46.720 --> 40:50.880
I can't listen to it. What do you call by the way? You're gonna hate this. He's a great guy

40:53.560 --> 41:01.600
He's got like this delightful canine personality like he's just yeah, he reminds me of that sounds punitive like like because dogs are lower life

41:01.600 --> 41:03.600
forms, I don't mean like

41:03.880 --> 41:09.240
The thing that you he just has this like like abundant energy. He's fun unconditional love

41:11.040 --> 41:14.000
I think I think he actually came to my birthday party one time

41:14.000 --> 41:16.840
I have I wait he was trying to replace you at your birthday

41:18.560 --> 41:20.560
Fucking no car

41:22.000 --> 41:27.560
Jerry Minor our friend was on a show was on carpoolers with him and they just showed up and we but he was a nice this guy

41:27.560 --> 41:31.640
I got no no no handsome enough to be a comedy store comedian

41:32.680 --> 41:38.560
Wait, you're saying he's UCB now. He's an improviser. He's strange. He's coming after me at all fucking angles right now

41:38.560 --> 41:40.560
That's what's going on. God damn it

41:40.560 --> 41:43.640
He's gonna be the Comptroller of Hurwitz town

41:47.320 --> 41:52.040
Hurwiburg I fucking please do that. Please have Jerry O'Connell and you do a podcast

41:52.720 --> 41:59.640
But have it just be about taking mine down like that's all you ever talk about is and how great the season four of community is

42:01.440 --> 42:03.440
Constantly quoting it

42:03.600 --> 42:09.080
My mom sent me a Facebook message apologizing for saying she liked season four

42:09.080 --> 42:14.040
Because she read in it some interview. Oh, wow that I threw her into the bus

42:14.680 --> 42:17.960
Did you say you don't remember is saying that because you got Changnesia?

42:23.840 --> 42:27.960
Season four reference that was very quickly swept under the rug

42:29.680 --> 42:35.000
Unceremoniously literally he could have looked into the camera and gone. No, that was a bunch of bullshit. I

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
Thought it was great

42:41.280 --> 42:45.960
Well, it wasn't out of judgment for any any any of the cannon it was just out of

42:46.560 --> 42:51.160
Judgment for the the tonnage of it like we just had to like I had to get things back on track

42:52.000 --> 42:57.680
And I'm very excited for next week's episode. I thought the first episode was so great

42:57.680 --> 43:02.400
Yeah, yeah guys, thanks. Thanks. Hey

43:11.880 --> 43:13.880
Thanks guys

43:13.880 --> 43:19.960
I don't know how to check a couple of us see that. Well, that was yeah, yeah

43:21.760 --> 43:24.320
You turn into a terrible SNL audition

43:28.640 --> 43:32.160
I wish Chevy Chase walked out during that applause that would have been the greatest thing

43:32.840 --> 43:39.360
We can get Chevy on the show now right now. It's now. It's okay on this show. Yeah, you said you don't want it, right?

43:39.360 --> 43:44.200
Well, I know I want to see this welcome here. Ah-ha-ha-ha

43:45.520 --> 43:47.520
There's no recollection I like

43:51.360 --> 43:54.680
We had Lorraine Newman on you haven't had Chevy on that's hilarious

43:55.240 --> 44:01.020
Well, I don't have a lot of community people on because I want to reserve the right to complain when when gossip articles

44:01.840 --> 44:03.840
Attributes the shows

44:04.480 --> 44:06.560
hilarious antics to you know

44:06.560 --> 44:12.760
The but whatever that's dumb because people are gonna do what they want. So I should have I should have the gang come down

44:17.000 --> 44:23.040
Yeah, I thought the actors felt they've always been fantastic, but they felt like re-energized. Yeah

44:23.040 --> 44:30.920
I mean, they're so goddamn it. They work so hard. They're so and they're so loyal so dedicated. I'm really excited about what?

44:30.920 --> 44:38.000
Donald Glover's what that thing's gonna be not to bring it. Yeah, I think if I was done editing it and I could tell you

44:38.000 --> 44:41.880
I could give it a letter grade for you, but I have no idea

44:41.880 --> 44:46.200
I mean, I know it's like like at the end of the episode where he leaves here did like like

44:47.040 --> 44:51.160
tears everywhere like uncontrollably. It's unavoidable

44:52.080 --> 44:54.080
but

44:54.080 --> 45:03.920
I'm gonna make it funny though. Just I would just cut that stuff out. Don't worry about it

45:11.280 --> 45:14.160
Can I say something just sort of change the topic you're getting I was

45:14.160 --> 45:23.240
You're getting married and that's very exciting and I don't want to so I was at I just want to tell you this quick story

45:24.120 --> 45:26.480
It's incredibly ominous beginning of the story

45:26.720 --> 45:34.360
Well, I'm just really hoping that Emily's not here anymore because we were at her house for Christmas and her mother

45:34.360 --> 45:36.360
Lahu I love it as a wonderful woman

45:36.720 --> 45:40.520
insisted that LeBron James was Kanye West

45:40.520 --> 45:43.640
during a basketball game

45:44.520 --> 45:50.520
The LeBron was seeing the two of them in a room together. So wait. She said she's thought that

45:50.680 --> 45:55.920
He has an alter ego like that. No, she was like that's Kanye West and his stats were up

45:55.920 --> 46:01.920
So I was like not only did you think Kanye plays in the NBA, but also that he shocked 60% from the field

46:01.920 --> 46:11.640
What was there's a Delante West in the NBA who had sex with LeBron James's mother, which is great

46:12.400 --> 46:16.400
Is that confirmed? That's a great story. Yeah confirmed. Otherwise, it'd be fighting words

46:17.080 --> 46:19.080
That's how you know

46:19.440 --> 46:21.440
Stop talking about sports. Oh

46:22.360 --> 46:24.360
Okay, she also

46:26.880 --> 46:30.360
They were talking about fucking they were talking about fucking it's about fucking bro

46:30.360 --> 46:35.000
She also referred to Will Smith as Jada Pinkett's husband

46:36.360 --> 46:40.760
She's like, what was that movie that Jada Pinkett's husband? We were like Will Smith?

46:40.760 --> 46:44.840
I think she's the most feminist racist of all time

46:45.400 --> 46:49.120
Even Jada's mom is like I was hanging out with Will Smith's wife

46:49.800 --> 46:54.800
Did you watch David Blaine show magic to the Smith family? No, no where he

46:54.800 --> 47:01.560
No, yeah, that was fantastic. They speaking of tears they he did one trick and it made all of the Smiths cry

47:02.680 --> 47:07.160
Literally Jada was crying Jaden was crying. Did he make Donald Glover? They believe in magic

47:08.160 --> 47:10.160
And now Donald Glover is gone

47:10.960 --> 47:12.960
Just it always gets them

47:13.200 --> 47:17.960
I like the one always gets cheers. I saw a clip that someone sent me on YouTube for some reason

47:17.960 --> 47:23.840
Yeah, yeah, he's in Harrison Ford's kitchen and he pulls a thing out of an orange and Harrison Ford just tells him to fuck off

47:27.360 --> 47:29.360
Which is kind of like air force

47:31.440 --> 47:33.440
My wife my kids

47:34.000 --> 47:35.360
the

47:35.360 --> 47:40.520
Do you guys have any opinion about buffet roast beef like like the way that it's

47:42.360 --> 47:47.040
Left by the way big opinions big opinions over there Tyler just left

47:47.040 --> 47:52.760
I was I was talking to Aaron about this and this is the one note. I came back with from Europe

47:52.760 --> 47:57.520
I was just looking at my every note thing. That's the one thing I wrote said roast beef in a buffet is for grown-ups

48:00.520 --> 48:05.840
I don't I feel very uncomfortable when you go up and there's a guy with the hat and the

48:06.760 --> 48:10.040
And then and then he's like like what what what would you like?

48:12.560 --> 48:14.800
Why haven't you finished before I got here?

48:14.800 --> 48:19.140
Well, you have to kind of pretend that what he's doing takes some real skill

48:19.880 --> 48:26.480
Just that one little Pete that just exact same quarter-inch. You're slicing for everything. Wow. Thank you. Nice. Well, so Dan

48:27.480 --> 48:32.480
You won't be surprised to know that I grew up in a family that has prime rib buffet opinions

48:32.480 --> 48:36.680
Like my mom and dad would actually say I would rather get give me that part

48:36.680 --> 48:38.680
Give me that probably they come out and go

48:38.680 --> 48:40.960
I want that one to this or that they have names for it

48:40.960 --> 48:45.520
But sometimes there's chicken or turkey and they go like you want white meat or dark meat. I don't know what the fuck you're talking

48:45.520 --> 48:48.320
About man. I don't work under that hood. Just feed me

48:52.280 --> 48:54.280
I'm a writer

48:56.400 --> 49:02.000
Different kinds of meat and the same animal. I don't know white meat is way better and I'm not that's well

49:02.000 --> 49:06.240
That's inaccurate. I didn't oh you like brown. I didn't mean to start this go down this road

49:06.240 --> 49:11.960
But white meat is dry and shitty. Oh fuck out. No get the fuck out of my kitchen. I

49:13.000 --> 49:16.760
Think I think they're confused because I think in a lot of Indian restaurants. They have

49:25.960 --> 49:31.800
Thanksgiving I just get like the stuffing and the mac and cheese like I don't even I secretly like people people are always like

49:31.800 --> 49:37.320
You go try the turkey or spend all the time on the turkey. Good. Fuck you tough titties for spending time on turkeys

49:37.320 --> 49:43.120
So you weren't eating turkey on Thanksgiving and someone said maybe you should try the turkey and then you got mad

49:44.680 --> 49:50.400
Have the turkey on Thanksgiving. Yeah, you started by saying this is this is a European UK thing

49:50.920 --> 49:54.560
Is that the first time you've encountered the guy in the house? No, I was just talking to Aaron about it

49:54.560 --> 49:59.280
So I thumbed it into my phone because she was bewildered. She's like, what are you talking about roast beef is grown-up food?

49:59.280 --> 50:02.720
What does that mean you're 41 and I was like, yeah

50:02.720 --> 50:08.320
But it's just like I just my brain shuts off when I see that the cutting board with the juice and the yeah

50:08.320 --> 50:13.560
There's like a half-cut shank of something and the guy's like like he's gonna cut the meat for you

50:13.560 --> 50:19.720
And you're gonna participate and it's just it's so it's so I don't like the locals to do where they act like they're like

50:19.720 --> 50:21.720
hooking you up

50:23.600 --> 50:28.120
I always feel like like like like like it's possible to do it wrong

50:28.120 --> 50:33.480
I got because because because it would be it's so absurd to answer honestly. What would you like I?

50:34.400 --> 50:36.400
roast beef

50:36.920 --> 50:38.920
What are you talking about?

50:39.920 --> 50:41.920
yell that at him

50:43.920 --> 50:48.000
Roast beef I want I think I'm not anymore not like this

50:49.360 --> 50:51.360
I don't I don't

50:51.360 --> 50:55.280
You don't live in that hood. It's like close-up magic or something all of a sudden. It's like like

50:55.280 --> 51:00.760
They're thinking well, what's your birthday? What kind of like you want to hear a story about three kings?

51:04.480 --> 51:06.880
Why didn't they cut it before I got there? I already

51:10.160 --> 51:15.720
Yeah, it's very good roast beef. Well Taylor shanters one of my favorites. That's a laurie. Yeah, yeah

51:15.720 --> 51:18.760
Yeah, so that's I'll say I'd like you to just cut a hole right in the middle. I just want this

51:20.880 --> 51:23.480
I'll just point at his leg give me that

51:23.480 --> 51:30.640
I've been vegetarian forever when I was a kid. I found out that I like the the end of it because it's the salty part

51:30.640 --> 51:35.360
Yeah, they put all the seasonings but you can't you can't just say to that guy you can't it's right over there

51:35.360 --> 51:38.120
That's why he's asking to give me the edge give me the top give me the thing

51:38.120 --> 51:43.080
You can say I'll see well that just confirms my suspicion that there's all this but it's like getting into a flight simulator

51:44.160 --> 51:49.400
Give me the edge give me the top that would be a cool proposal though is put the ring in the fucking

51:49.400 --> 51:53.640
Yeah, I like hey get the top. Yeah, you have to tell the top she wants the top

51:53.640 --> 51:57.720
I didn't I took till I was like 35 years old to come to terms with the fact that

51:58.320 --> 52:05.080
It's it's hair cuttings fault that I'm intimidated when I sit in that chair like as a science

52:05.080 --> 52:07.400
It's a it's a dumb. It's a dumb activity

52:08.800 --> 52:10.800
getting my hair cut and

52:12.040 --> 52:15.200
When I sit in the chair and someone's got a pair of scissors

52:15.840 --> 52:17.280
Obviously, I want my hair shorter

52:17.280 --> 52:23.240
I don't know how else to say it and I don't I don't this isn't a ticket that I wanted to buy and I don't

52:23.240 --> 52:29.080
I don't have a headshot of someone that I want to look like and I don't I don't I don't know the terminology

52:30.080 --> 52:32.080
Not above my left ear

52:32.720 --> 52:36.240
Feather feather the doofus and put a put a put a duck tail on the

52:38.120 --> 52:43.760
Widows peak I would love it if there's an episode of community this season where Jeff is like what the fuck is it with haircuts and

52:43.760 --> 52:45.760
I

52:46.720 --> 52:52.600
Just it's so intimidating the conversation you don't like that you don't like I don't like the feeling that I'm like cutting things

52:52.600 --> 52:59.160
Is that no no it's it's that it's that moment of exchange between you and some kind of threshold guardian or

53:00.440 --> 53:07.840
Expert a professional a professional across but but but but someone who hasn't adopted as part of their craft

53:07.840 --> 53:16.360
Meeting you halfway as a layman someone someone who because they cut people's hair who do care about hair terminology when you go

53:16.360 --> 53:18.600
I I don't know they're like

53:19.600 --> 53:21.600
Why don't you know you monster

53:22.800 --> 53:28.640
Where do you get your haircut just make it look like me about two months ago? Yeah, that is actually what I said

53:28.640 --> 53:31.280
Yeah, he gets his hair cut at Dick's last resort

53:31.280 --> 53:43.080
But I finally just started saying my answer to the question now is I just tell him about my average day I go

53:43.080 --> 53:47.360
Let me tell you how this is gonna work like no matter what you do in here. Here's how I'm gonna treat my hair

53:47.720 --> 53:53.620
I'm gonna go to sleep. I'm gonna wake up and go to work. I so I drive with the windows down. You need to know that

53:56.840 --> 53:59.240
It's not gonna get washed until the next time you see me

53:59.240 --> 54:01.160
I

54:01.160 --> 54:04.280
Just make it short amazing. We don't have wigs, you know

54:04.280 --> 54:09.760
Not like the feather not the powdered wigs that people used to wear but I could totally see a Los Angeles wear

54:10.040 --> 54:12.040
Like you're wearing the Tom Cruise

54:12.640 --> 54:16.640
You know what I mean, and then just I'm wearing the Indian restaurant

54:18.200 --> 54:20.200
I'm wearing the Dama Rara. You've got this

54:20.720 --> 54:22.720
I got the Seth Meyer

54:22.720 --> 54:25.480
I was gonna get that I was gonna get the Seth Meyer

54:25.480 --> 54:31.240
Well, we can't all we can't all have the Seth Meyer bitch. You know what I mean like everyone with like cars like there's six kinds

54:34.120 --> 54:37.200
The only reason you can see my ears is because as an actor

54:37.200 --> 54:42.800
I played like doctors and cops and shit like that if I if I weren't an actor I'd have I look like Tom Kiefer from Cinderella

54:42.800 --> 54:48.000
I had fuck I've had fucking big like keep Keith Richard Altamont hair that that's that's what I would have

54:48.000 --> 54:53.360
But what is the Cinderella thing you just Tom Kiefer is a lead singer of Cinderella. Oh the band. Yeah, okay

54:53.360 --> 54:56.600
Yeah, look him up. He's got fuck. Yeah, that's what most people think when they hear Cinderella

54:58.320 --> 55:00.680
The band we grew up with we love this

55:02.400 --> 55:05.720
The true Cinderella fans know who I'm talking about yeah, I'm sure they

55:06.200 --> 55:12.240
Cinderella by the way fucking if they play go fucking see him because they'll kick your dick in through your that doesn't sound

55:12.240 --> 55:21.680
I think I saw them where do they do the Main Street Electrical Parade because I saw I think I saw who you're talking about

55:24.680 --> 55:31.720
They were big light blue who dresses right and there's usually a bear or some sort of animal walking from just kicking the dick

55:31.720 --> 55:40.000
Into every little kid you shit out you shit out your own dick and they serve a primary up that will just

55:42.000 --> 55:45.280
Is there an extra mic back there because it would be nice to bring Steve A. G. out

55:49.280 --> 55:52.160
I saw him in the green room. Is he still here?

55:54.240 --> 55:56.560
No, don't Mitch Steve A. G.

55:56.560 --> 56:02.800
No, that's where Spencer's gonna sit. Just let Steve Hover. I think they're gonna

56:05.240 --> 56:09.560
Share I I hope you didn't think I came just assuming I didn't know

56:10.560 --> 56:12.560
Here

56:13.080 --> 56:18.320
Podcast and though was hanging out. No, no, I didn't I didn't I don't I don't when I see people in the green room

56:18.320 --> 56:23.640
I don't go they want to be on the show. I just I it's my choice. Okay, I'm back and I'm sick

56:23.640 --> 56:28.040
I don't I'm not very charismatic. So I thought I thought let's just bring up a mental rush more of of

56:29.600 --> 56:34.080
Apparently you say you're sick though, but you got pretty pretty vehement and emotional during that

56:35.480 --> 56:38.560
That's probably how it comes out. Well, I just yeah, I mean I have iron

56:39.880 --> 56:42.440
I'm just gonna sit here so you can have that seat until

56:44.720 --> 56:49.560
That buffet that we went to we were driving back from Inverness were Loch Ness's and we're driving back down to Edinburgh

56:49.560 --> 56:56.120
We stopped at a place called House of Brewer, which is like the outlet mall for Scottish things and it was that was a good buffet

56:56.600 --> 57:01.320
Like like they got french fries right at a buffet the chips. They were fucking off the deep

57:01.320 --> 57:05.760
I was sitting out in the cold and Aaron Aaron wanted to get didn't like her foods that she wanted to get a sandwich

57:05.760 --> 57:11.720
I got mad at her because I felt like my mommy abandoned me and the cold is freezing. I know it's really romantic

57:11.720 --> 57:15.040
It's gonna, you know, I'm a great great husband

57:15.040 --> 57:21.400
But I was like and then I was kind of like are you left me out here you search your sandwich you barely

57:21.920 --> 57:27.880
And then I I like I was taking my tray and I I I went up to the door

57:27.880 --> 57:33.320
And I was opening it and then the Diet Coke that was on the tray toppled off and I went I went goddamn it

57:33.880 --> 57:39.480
Like that and and and I was it was such a disturbance to the European old world

57:39.480 --> 57:44.560
Melanus like all these guys and there's a little checkered checkered flat caps damage

57:44.560 --> 57:48.920
This is this this but this guy this guy right right next to where I did it

57:48.920 --> 57:52.720
Like he's sitting with his wife eating his chips and eat and I said god damn it

57:52.720 --> 57:57.160
I started picking up the coke bottle and I and I and I without looking at him

57:57.160 --> 58:02.320
I just said I said sorry and and and and and he said it's all right

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
It can't be helped

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Oh

58:07.560 --> 58:13.620
At an American buffet, it's just people throwing handfuls of noodles and yelling god damn it

58:14.120 --> 58:20.600
If you've been to the soup plantation, that's all it is people fighting for a last potato when I was broke in college

58:20.600 --> 58:23.000
I used to go to the soup plantation at the Beverly connection

58:23.000 --> 58:27.520
Which I think is gone now across from the Beverly Center and I would I would just eat there for free

58:27.520 --> 58:32.400
I would just kind of steal my way in I would go in and you walk normally you get a plate go to the salad bar walk

58:32.400 --> 58:38.160
And you pay and walk into the inner sanctum where there's pizzas and mutton cameo. Would you grab a fucking sorry?

58:38.160 --> 58:44.600
I can't find a spot to be at when I'm not blocking someone. So this is good. This is good. Oh, no, no, no, no keep it

58:44.600 --> 58:46.600
Thank you, Adam. Thank you

58:47.920 --> 58:49.200
Okay

58:49.200 --> 58:53.720
What I used to do is I would go in there and I would just walk past them with a book and I would go in and I would find

58:53.720 --> 58:56.720
Somebody who had left with an empty like there was like like the empty plates

58:56.720 --> 58:58.920
And I just sit there and read my book for a while

58:58.920 --> 59:02.960
And they would come up and say more iced tea because it would be like a nice teeth and I go sure thing and and

59:03.280 --> 59:06.280
Then after about a half hour I get up and I would just resume eating

59:06.480 --> 59:09.000
And I went there so smart at the system

59:09.000 --> 59:14.840
I went I went there so often I knew they're all of their names and they knew my name and they would give me a little

59:14.840 --> 59:20.920
Like to go, but we made some fresh cookies Jeff here. You are and I stopped stealing from soup plantation because I felt bad

59:21.920 --> 59:24.960
I went there the other day and Jerry O'Connell was hanging out

59:24.960 --> 59:32.160
God damn what what's a soup plantation a play on have you thought about that for more it feels like it's racist

59:32.880 --> 59:37.600
Sounds racist. Yeah, I mean we hear that. Well, they took out the cotton bar. They used to have a whole thing

59:37.600 --> 59:47.160
You would pick your pick your pick your own male

59:50.160 --> 59:53.800
Yeah, they would weigh your bag and if it wasn't big enough, you know

59:55.720 --> 59:57.720
That's actually what did used to happen

59:57.720 --> 01:00:11.080
It's nice by the way to come back to our melting pot country. I don't I don't I don't doubt that there are parts of I mean

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.640
I know having been to London that that's you wouldn't yeah, that's

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:20.760
You know, you're like in New York or LA. They're terms of ethnic cross-section, but but other parts of UK man

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:25.880
You're like in Scotland. I saw absolutely four black people. You know, we were there for two weeks

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:31.440
I say with shame I fucking counted because it was weird when I saw black person there

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:35.880
It was it was exhilarating because I was like, holy shit. You're the you're not named Craig

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:43.440
It's like it's like it was very exciting. Not only is it wonderful to just see a bunch of brown faces again, but it's also all that you know

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.680
It's also nice to see all of the all of the mutts

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.760
White faces like like all of us of European descent

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:57.680
We're still all fucking snaggled and like like like mixed up and like like like over there

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.960
They're like they look like like action figures of British people like they there's a

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.340
You can kind of feel the the the the inbreeding

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:12.200
Yeah, like any group any group that stays kind of homogenous. Yeah, I don't want to yeah

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:17.400
I don't want to say there's some big dudes in Scotland. There's some fucking. I'm just shy of six four

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:24.600
There's some giant motherfuckers out there. Oh, we went into a pub where people must have been next to some put the shark-punching factory

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.040
And then there was they were on lunch break

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.840
Speaking of house of brewery at the buffet thing the night before

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.520
Well, actually no come on sport. We picked up kilts to wear over over Hockman a and New Year's Eve

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.000
I what does Hockman a mean? Is it like a pink thing?

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.440
No, I'm not doing a bit

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:47.780
I would it's a it's a Scott's Kelt word. I think for for their New Year's celebration

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:55.560
We got kilts we rented them and it only occurred to me like after we'd rented them actually right before we'd rented them

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.520
You're renting a piece of fabric where you're not allowed to wear underwear like properly

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:05.720
So I was like, oh, you see your dicks gonna be rubbing up against the front of a thing that has been rubbed against countless dicks

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:10.240
But I thought no, so you're sitting down on something like like that's just countless assholes on that

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:15.480
We're worried about the asshole. Yeah, and none of that occurs to me. Also, and you might be wearing it backwards

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:25.840
Which is really well I wore it sideways. Well, when you wear clothes, it's not like your asshole is rubbing on the clothes, right?

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.960
You know, I'm just saying you sit down. You have an Audi. You have a naked

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.480
Yes, I do

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:42.260
I'm saying I'm saying naked naked ass against the against that old saying if you're gonna rent a Kelt wear it sideways. Yeah

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:51.040
My girlfriend is Scottish and she insisted that you you cannae wear knickers. Unless you're a pussy

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.560
And so so I'm so we're not wearing it

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:57.760
We've been you didn't wear yours in the morning of it in Vanessa, but Matt MacGorley and I we flashed her

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:01.360
She said you got to go out to Loch Ness and flash your balls at

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.200
At that Nessie I go. Oh, so we did it. We took a picture of us flashing our

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:11.600
Really just me and Matt Gurley my friends in seventh grade just flashing our Nessie's gonna look a lot like my dad in the bushes

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.880
But we did that I

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:19.920
Said like there's people like there's families kind of near us not facing our dicks and balls

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:24.400
But like like around I'm like is that kind of a corny like touristy thing that they're just like no

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.760
I did that. I just made that up. So we did that

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:32.000
But we I was I'm driving back the three-hour ride from Inverness back to Edinburgh

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.920
We stop at House of Brewer to get lunch and go shop on and stuff and I got my kilt on and there was a glass

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:41.820
Awesomely at a place that sells kilt. There's a glass stairway a glass spiral staircase

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:50.200
To get from one part of the fucking House of Brewer to the restaurant you have to go down that staircase I

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.500
I learned and there's fucking families down there. And I was like like

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:59.740
Fuck it went in Rome, baby. Like I fucking did it, but I learned something about about

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:04.120
And I learned this the hard way. I'm not circumcised and most people

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:21.620
And I miss both I am circumcised I'm circumcised and most I am circumcised most most Scotsmen are not

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:27.460
you want to not be circumcised wearing a fucking kilt because that wool is a scrubby I

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:33.780
Have a fucking abrasion on my cock right now from wearing that thing. It's a stop getting tortured under there

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:38.060
But the spore and my wiener just turns into like a nipple

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:42.900
Especially in that kind of cold it just recedes into me like an octopus cup

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:48.420
Use my dick to rob a skyscraper like a cat burglar

01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:50.420
I could

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:56.740
If I had another one, I guess you need another deck your dick didn't get sort you dick didn't get rubbed in the thing

01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:01.660
And then no, I'm telling you it recedes not there are growers and showers and then there's old

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.700
camera here

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:13.740
Matt and I both had the same experience where you have the spore and which holds your you know your keys and your phone and your

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:19.340
And you should have a hip flask in there. So it's always kind of just rubbing that holds your little tinkle down. Yeah

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.020
your little

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.380
Your big giant tinkle Jeff

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:32.340
It's like it kind of yeah, it kind of it applies a little bit of pressure to to your to your wiener like

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:38.340
Wait, what is this? Holds your holds your

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:45.180
On the big locket thing the big kind of man purse that holds you like yeah, it's an ancient Highlander fanny pack. Yeah

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:50.700
It's a great fucking thing. I know it's amazing. Yeah wallet and five that can I put my wallet and phone in here?

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:53.060
Or am I like haunting their ancestors by doing that?

01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:57.580
I don't want to do something like gosh as like ambassador of my country, but yeah

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.660
Yeah, you put your phone on your wallet in there. Holy shit

01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:02.500
You could cut a hole that put your tinkle at that

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:05.020
your little tinkle

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:07.380
The worst thing I've ever heard

01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:11.980
Where else are you gonna put the tic-tac, you know what I mean like you got it

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:15.060
You got to put it what?

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:20.460
Do you guys in high school tuck under the waistband? Oh

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.680
My school when you had bonus. Yeah

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:29.600
Yeah, you have you have to talk like it's so sometimes I had to do that like what one well

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:34.240
They yeah, I really had to break a record order for it to have that kind of

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:39.920
Every guy there has a or are you talking about your own waistband? Yes

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.080
Yeah

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.040
It's a real name of the principal we should not we got a cut that

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:57.040
Now we're saying it

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.480
All right, Mike my high school

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.800
principal's name Leo Kamalich

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.920
Kamalich Kamalich

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:09.720
It's pretty funny. Did you ever get made fun of you you betcha

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.560
Schrab had a gym teacher named mr. Reamer

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:20.000
I we had a someone named miss Dickey who is dating our band teacher named mr. Titsworth

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.880
It's worth and miss Dickey

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.760
I didn't know and wrote that you know when your family name is Titsworth that's somewhere in the past your family like saved the king's life because

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:40.180
Otherwise you would be weeded out wait a minute. We're Titsworth's

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:43.240
We teach that's what we do

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:47.980
We do two things we save kings and we teach English a

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.900
Guy came to our high school

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:55.380
When I was like a senior and from the Princeton review to talk about preparing for the SATs

01:07:55.380 --> 01:08:00.820
And his name was dick moorhead and we did sure a fucking we didn't hear a thing. He said for two hours

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:04.380
We were never heard anything. He's ever said

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.100
He gets to be president just because he's

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:14.900
Actually, it's Richard. I go by Richard. All right, whatever. He's right. It was Richard, but we connected those dots

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:18.540
Do we settle the roast beef thing?

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.420
You know what I don't like about it

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:25.460
Maybe I don't like if my food resembles an animal in any way

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:29.260
That's why I don't eat fish because it looks still like the animal. Is that what it is like you see the ball

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:33.780
He doesn't like the idea that there's a right or wrong way to eat roast beef

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:39.620
And I don't like social interaction at a buffet like I don't I don't I don't want when they ask you what?

01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:43.660
People acting like professionals about ridiculous. I mean, these are guys that used to build dams

01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:48.860
You know what I mean? Like these are the same people that would have got skyscrapers in the 30s, you know

01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:53.600
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I just don't I just don't like it. I get uncomfortable

01:08:54.100 --> 01:09:01.080
When when when when I'm talking to somebody, okay? I am in a crisis mode like I if I have somebody

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:06.560
Come comes up to me after the show and don't do this. I'll give you scotch flu

01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:09.320
but

01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:15.320
So when someone comes up to me and says hello, my name is so-and-so. It's nice to meet you like I'm

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.720
Barely hearing like five percent of that well. Well, I'm just like

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:30.920
And that's the point of course when they're going my name is Jonathan or whatever so I'm never gonna remember

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.920
You're turning to Al Pacino

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:42.320
Cuz you got a point out what is it? Do you think it's because is it because you're you're you don't want to let them down?

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:47.440
No, I think it's because I'd like to retract that I'm not gonna get modeling about it

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:52.280
But I think my theory is that as a child when my brain was developing

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:59.860
I think that those were the moments of crisis. I mean the like for other people probably moments of isolation were moments of crisis

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:02.520
I have a lot of memories about being left places

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.320
And feeling a tremendous amount of relief

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:11.200
The mall I would say yeah, I love it

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:19.240
My I was like I was like hiding under a table at nurseries to daycare center at a bowling alley once and they didn't know

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.600
I was there so they kind of wrapped everything up. I didn't like the other kids

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:25.840
I was just I would just like find a cupboard and I just climb in it

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:31.080
And I would just sit there and I was I was not doing it to be melodramatic. I just I just like like too too much

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:36.700
Man with the people like like like girls would put crayons in your mouth and like like like what one girl did

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.520
Yeah, this is not a standard experience. I don't I should

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:45.080
You know, I don't want to be sexist. There was one girl put a crayon in my mouth

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:50.880
That sounds horrible. That's like such a violation. She's what she was trying to do like a lipstick thing

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.640
She probably liked you. She probably liked me, but but too much too much too much

01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:02.960
and and and and and so like like I think that my brain while developing its circuitry

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:08.680
Identifies those moments. It's like, you know, it's just there's a lot of like there's a lot of like toll booths and things

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:13.320
And there's just a lot of shit to keep track of and it's just like like eye contact

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:16.920
For me is the

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:23.440
Mental equivalent of holding a microphone in front of a speaker like I when I look somebody in the eye

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.440
It's such a perfect one for Aaron to come to

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.800
Just how I wish he knew this

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:37.960
Does Wally look like a perfect sort of like a society to you Wally the movie. Yeah. Yeah, I like that. I'd like to be Wally

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:46.040
Do you feel it's because there's something expected of you I'm trying to like narrow in I think that all humans fear

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:52.240
Excommunication alienation. I think that I think that in those moments. It's make or break

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:59.520
I would I think that I think that if you're not good at sports and you're not like you're not gifted socially on the playground

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.520
I think I think

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:09.320
It's it's at those moments when people are talking to you when you're at the most danger of getting kicked out of

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.480
The monkey tree right of being exposed

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:18.040
We are actually likes going to parties like a certain point that it becomes more

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:21.160
Worry than like all right. I'm gonna party tonight

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:28.280
It was like, oh, I'm gonna see them or do what I think it's a line from Seinfeld once but I remember I've always felt

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.000
I assure you not your not what you said

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.960
But what George said was something like I've never been upset about a meeting being cancelled or something

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:40.520
Oh, yeah, I really feel that way. Yeah, there's no meeting that I wouldn't be happy if they have to move

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:46.280
And you know, I get to be put out. Oh, I'm halfway to Burbank. Okay. No, you know what? I totally get it

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.280
Yeah, they're the one to do it. Yeah

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.640
That is great, I like going to parties. I'm sorry

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.880
I feel like going

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:01.240
Well, he's like the Kumail was voted like sexiest

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.760
Sexiest

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.760
Slave mother-in-law

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Which is worrying on a couple levels

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.600
I found like my Scottish girlfriend Kate was saying like like when you go to Scotland like like don't

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:24.120
Don't be so gregarious. Don't like don't like don't introduce yourself. Yeah, I kept embarrassing her like hello

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:27.840
I'm Jeff like they don't fucking do it. I apparently but nobody was bummed out by it

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.280
But she's like like they didn't do it there like like they don't they like like people don't just walk up and go

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.320
How do you do? Like they don't do that. So I kept getting teased for being

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:41.960
Like like chatty and gregarious but thing is like everybody was cool with it

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.080
But like that I thought like you would really like that down like it's a culture of people like they tend to be a little more

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:52.720
Leconic and like well, it's colder. You covered up, right? There's all these things you do to kind of keep yourself away from

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:59.960
I think like I've always been very like like good in a room and good in a crowd

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:03.480
But I think I also part of that. Hello. How do you do stuff?

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:07.840
I also forget names because during that five five minutes or that five seconds of meeting somebody

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:13.280
I'm not paying attention to somebody's name. I forget names all the fucking time

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.640
I did it in the in the green room just now like I'm terrible at it. Mitch

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.760
There's actually great I work on Cheers, right? Yeah, okay

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:27.440
Reading a thing about how there's a great way to remember people's names like you can remember anybody's name

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.840
You have to care

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.840
Yeah, see that

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:38.760
That's a bridge too far. I know it's a bridge too far. It's a tough. It's a tough. I do I could draw somebody afterwards

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:41.480
I remember I can remember everything they wore it could be two years later

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:47.320
I could remember I could tell you the conversation verbatim. I don't know your fucking name. Yeah, I think that's pretty common actually

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:54.200
I don't think that's so I'm gonna say I'm special but like I I'm good at like like chatting with people and being like

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.720
convivial and stuff like that, but I think I

01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:03.080
I also and that's my way of keeping people like like the Heisman trophy kind of an arms length

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.840
You know, like I hold on to what's dear and we're gonna press people

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:09.640
Can you stop talking about sports, please? Yeah, it's my podcast

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:16.720
I'll go through a party invite and look at the guest list, you know where you can see who's replied yesterday

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:22.000
And I will go through and all the people that have replied. Yes, I will I will picture the conversation

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.620
I will be having with that person and if there's ever an awkward one. I'm like, I can't go to this

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.160
But I'll see you feel like I just went. Yeah

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:39.040
It saves gas it saves money also Netflix Q you don't have to watch. Yeah, you've read the descriptions

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.720
You never say goodbye at parties

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:46.120
That's and so my mission became for a full couple months to catch you trying to leave

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:51.080
Yeah, and I would I would like call you out. It's crazy that we have to say bye or

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:56.800
Because because if you said if you say goodbye to everyone at the party, that's called being at the party twice

01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.920
That's what you do it when you get to the party

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.400
You go say hi to everybody

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.360
You're not leaving you'd have to go to each of them and say well, I'm not leaving

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.640
It's so I'm gonna go up to somebody like I am leaving so you might want to

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:15.640
I

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:21.760
Pick one person that I choose someone as emissary or ambassador like yeah, I'm leaving if anybody asks I fucking boned out like yeah

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:24.200
Maybe like somebody yeah, somebody's gonna see me dart out

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:29.280
But yeah, you ever as someone left out saying bye and you've gone like they didn't say bye to me

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:33.160
That was that's a polite way of saying I wonder if anybody ever said where's Jeff

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:40.800
Well this happened to me last week someone left but they were at my house and they were like only two people there

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:44.880
And I won't know what it is. I mean we just like did blank. Just leave

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.080
While we were hanging in

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:54.080
Chris McKenna on your writing staff it'll be four people and he'll just evaporate like it

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:58.440
He'll just fucking atomize the Irish goodbye to the to master yes

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:05.520
He has a black belt and fuck like just disappearing acts like but we were all we were mid conversation

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:11.040
He said he went to the he had to go to the bathroom. He's like good. You just hear like like a car like what? Yeah?

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.560
Like that's fucked up

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.680
If you're six foot six like he is and you can stand in front of a table and go good night everybody

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:26.920
I say do that one don't just fucking crawl under the carpet. He's like leave

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.480
Our writers assistant has a shotgun

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:38.720
Sound effect queued up on his computer literally anytime Mike sure goes anywhere else you hear he plays that sound effect

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.040
So we'll just be like

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.040
Work on that and then I'll go into his office

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.800
And it's funny

01:17:45.800 --> 01:18:01.720
Oh, yeah, I think it's time to we should bring a Spencer. Shouldn't we? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, let's get Spencer

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Hey

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:13.400
We were wondering you when we were in Scotland we were wondering if you would be a kilt type how you would take because you're such a

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.680
Short-skye and oh, yeah, I'm all about ventilation. Yeah

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.520
Did I ask you

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:29.600
Spencer could cotton to the whole thing I could see I could I could see you just putting on a kilt and then and then

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:33.960
Having an epiphany and going like pants are all about limitation of movement

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:42.160
He's wearing jeans tonight. Yeah, I've never seen that before so awkward. I guess those are pajama jeans, right?

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:50.760
That's what my dad wears. He's he is big into like designer jeans. He's like touch them. They're like pajamas

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.080
Can I tell you this? This is what happened to my dad

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:59.960
Last week in his house. He fell down. This is not a happy story. It's just a crazy story broke his arm

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.120
He's 58. He's young broke his arm between his shoulder and his elbow broke it

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:09.720
But it was a blizzard. So he's been sitting at home for four days. What with a broken arm and

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:15.200
It's like a fucking zombie movie. He's like, you know, I'm just sitting here eating a lot of Tylenol extras

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:20.160
And that's what he's been doing for like five days. Well, he can't get out to go to a doctor

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:25.200
Yeah, he can't get out to go to a doctor. Where'd he live? The Jersey? It's like a foot of snow outside

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:31.040
Yeah, he's just there with a fucked up arm. He's just like he gets up in the morning 127 hour situation. Yeah

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.920
Tomorrow you might not have an arm or a dad

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:43.240
It's joking. He's fine. He's doing great. Right. There's that there's that one scenario where he just chews off the rest of his body

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.240
Just leaves you

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.720
Where's dad?

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:56.360
Is most of that movie spent with James Franco in the hole or is most of it like flashbacks to how he ended up in the hole

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.360
Most is with the rock before he gets there

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.120
Dwayne The Rock Johnson

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.800
I thought you were saying it's the whole geological history of that rock

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.840
It's this thing of like 500,000 years of

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.840
Yeah, Morgan Freeman comes over the voiceover

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:15.360
When I was 10, I always wondered how rocks were

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:18.880
Franco parts of the blip on the radar of that rock

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:25.120
The clock I'm not I'm not I'm never gonna watch that movie. That's not that's why would you?

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:30.200
It's great, but it's a guy in isolation. Isn't that heaven Dan? No, and to be clear

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:34.280
I mean I've I've nobody's more lonely than me and nobody reacts for poorly in isolation than me

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:38.600
But as a kid I was just like, you know, I was very very relieved to get some time alone

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:42.680
I just didn't I just didn't want to walk away from that conversation

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.680
Without having clarified that

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:52.320
But then Dan like so like how does being an like on stage with a microphone in front of a group of people?

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:56.040
Because that's how does that compare is that heaven or hell or both or like well

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.560
It's it's heaven because I get to get to talk to people

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:05.800
But I've got I got personal space around me and no one's like with the exception of Adam Goldberg talking back

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:13.360
No, I like that the pit, you know, so when our crowd here sometimes people come come up and whatever it's it's it's

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:20.640
It's it's more it feels more honest to me because I feel like when you meet someone on a street corner

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:27.200
There's this performance element to it that that feels dishonest because you're on a street corner

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:33.520
But that's well, but that's all about being authentic. I mean, that's what you end up trying to struggle with I do

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.000
You know, I thought I was thinking am I being full of shit here?

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.560
I might you know my am I trying to be am I trying to be likable much? I get very self-conscious about that

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:47.200
And you can get past that almost like you do on stage really which is just kind of making it about them

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.720
Yeah, but I don't I mean well up

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.840
I guess that's where the bad habit comes in because up here

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:56.760
I'm allowed to make it all about me and what I need to do is try to form if I'm serious about wanting to change

01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:02.460
I try to form new synapses in my brain where I care about the other people where I'm like listening and like

01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:10.260
You know when you were traveling like for me heaven is being in a new city a new country and meeting like and learning that

01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:14.940
Like like learning new things about different cultures, but you find out everybody's the same

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:19.380
But like people are people and wherever you go and that's like the most rewarding thing in the world

01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:25.300
So I have heaven for me is a stranger at a bar like the most interesting person is always the stranger sitting next to you for me

01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:31.820
That's my heaven, but that's totally opposite of you. Probably Dan like a like you're you're way more insular when you when you travel

01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:34.300
yeah, and

01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:40.140
You also said you don't like traveling to countries where they don't speak English that that's that's that's hard on you, right?

01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:45.060
Yeah, I mean you just feel inadequate, right? I feel inadequate. I feel like I'm so sorry

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:48.260
I don't speak your language. I feel like I should apologize for it all the time

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:52.740
Yeah, I can barely understand the Scottish and the Irish and that's all I can do to try to keep up

01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:55.420
I can't I can't I can't understand half of you guys

01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:58.700
I'm all I'm all I did you pointed me when you said

01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:08.460
I'm always in America. I'm constantly going what what what what I don't know if I'm hard of hearing or I think it's more like

01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:11.260
I'm so fucking overwhelmed when someone's talking to me that I I

01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:15.140
Can't I got a I got a buffer it and like digest it or something

01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:19.860
So yeah, I fucking Paris was a goddamn beyond a nightmare

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:23.180
It was just I just had to switch off and just be like soon. We'll be out of Paris

01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:27.100
I don't I was just I just I don't know what to do

01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:30.260
I I don't want to be the guy that refuses to try to speak French

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:34.100
So I'll try to speak French and order fucking up. I guess I ordered the boot

01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:38.220
I'll eat the boot. I'm eating the boot mayor see mayor see

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:41.060
Why is the boot on the menu?

01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:44.820
Just there for a test at a restaurant

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:53.420
Are we eating at a shoe store? They have a menu

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:57.180
So they call it Zara here too

01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:04.740
Stupid that's been sir. There's a guy in a corner cutting up a boot. What part of the boot do you want?

01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:09.180
To nightmares

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:14.060
I mean I talk about a nightmare shoe shopping when the people are get all hands on about it like oh

01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:25.380
Steve do you travel do you like to like go abroad? Yeah, I haven't traveled in a while

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:27.380
I think the last place I went was Halifax

01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:32.540
I'd love to know which was beautiful my dad my dad or dad said he loved it. Will you shoot working there?

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:34.620
No, I was just

01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:41.220
Hang it out. You just fucked up with a friend to a cab in in the middle of nowhere with no electricity or running water

01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:47.460
We got water from a well and you know swam in a lake and kayak then it was amazing

01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:49.660
I think this conforms with how people think of you

01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:55.980
Yeah

01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:58.580
I was

01:24:58.580 --> 01:25:03.940
Don't realize that Josh Josh hang out there on your own all the time. Yeah, I go do mushrooms out there

01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:06.940
Oh on your own, right? I'm not on my own

01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:09.300
I did acid at Joshua tree and I was sitting on a rock

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:11.980
those big round rocks and

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:15.100
I don't like snakes like when I'm not on acid and

01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:18.420
But on acid

01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:24.260
I was sitting on a rock and I didn't I did like a tiny but I wasn't really really really tripping

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:29.500
But I was I was I was on acid. I was high and I heard just like the bugs are going

01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:34.740
Looking at a rock. It was like a face. I went there sober the next day. It still looked like a face by the way

01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:38.260
You didn't have to be on acid to see a face in this rock

01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:40.260
But I was just sitting there like

01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:47.900
My friend Mark Rivers comes up with a big like heavy-duty like the flashlight was giant like lantern ones

01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:53.900
Yeah, hey, man, you're bobbin me out with your lights man. The moon is bright enough Jack, you know fucking

01:25:54.940 --> 01:26:00.760
Listen to the bugs man. He's like Jeff. Don't move. It's a rattlesnake. Nick. The buzzing was a fucking rattlesnake

01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:03.260
He was sitting right next to you good

01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:09.100
I'd been there for an hour listening to that and I look at me like hey, buddy

01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:15.780
The next day I was not on acid and I was looking over both shoulders my jeans tucked into my shoes like it was fucking

01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:18.780
I think the snakes and Joshua tree are probably used

01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:31.580
But if you're gonna do a listen to Jen's Joshua trees in place place

01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:37.540
I did it Madison Square Garden last week and it was great for what acid fish. Yeah, you wait

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:40.380
You didn't ask it acid at a fish fish is still a bent

01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:44.500
Don't don't Paris. This is like his fucking thing, dude

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:49.740
Yeah, yeah, I did almost get into my first fight at a fish show ever out of like 90 shows

01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:53.780
We're like what would a fish fight me about it's like a big

01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:02.380
It's hacky what this fight was about but there was a guy who was on ketamine special K

01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:09.100
When you're on K, you're like base position is like leaning back and you're bumping into everyone and I kind of you

01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:13.100
It's just known that you kind of push gently push him off you when he goes and bumps in the next person

01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:18.260
Yeah, that's no that's his night, but I just I gently pushed him and I feel these two arms wrap around me

01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:21.820
He's thick arms. He's like don't fucking push him. That's my son

01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.620
Ketamine guys dad Papa K

01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:37.140
Papa K and he he wouldn't let go and he was like he's just drunk. I was like he hasn't been drinking all night

01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:44.060
He's on ketamine. I know what that is. He's done a terrible job

01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:47.500
And he said if I let go don't fucking push him

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:54.420
I said let go me right now let go me and he's not letting go my friend who weighs probably 300 pounds

01:27:54.420 --> 01:28:00.140
It's very large man finally sees this happening. He's on acid too, and he just bowls both of us over

01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:07.460
Charges at us he takes you down, too. He yeah, he was like he's tripping. I was like I appreciate just

01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:13.460
Fucking breaking up the whole situation. He aimed for him, but I got a little baby with the bath water

01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:15.460
Yeah, and then

01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:22.460
The guy he my friend standing between us as this guy and I'm on acid and and it's very scary when this is being yelled at

01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:30.180
You he's like you don't know the rage of a father. I

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:36.260
Got took I got took

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:40.580
What do you think was he on anything he must have been on something that's that's very

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:47.260
I don't know what I saw and this kid does some K and then they go to fish together

01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:53.660
But for the rest of the night he was holding his son up from his belt hoop this kid was like 23 or something

01:28:53.660 --> 01:29:00.100
So it's a very weird dynamic. That's fucking weird. Have you really been to 90 fish concerts? Yeah, roughly. Yeah

01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:06.620
Do you like follow them around like is it like you go on tours with them? I honestly I know nothing about fish

01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:10.220
I have a podcast you should come on. I'll try to get you to like them. All right

01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:14.660
Is it about fish? Yeah, it's called analyze fish. I try to get Scott off

01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:16.660
I like that

01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:21.620
I want to I want to take that the Harris Wittles fish challenge. Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love that

01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:30.340
Most likely Bob you having to do drugs and go to a fish show fucking that is what Scott didn't deal

01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:36.300
I mean like yeah, it sounds great. I mean the old joke about Grateful Dead is what a Grateful Dead fans say when the drugs were off

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:40.340
What the fuck are we listening to? I think Grateful Dead is horrible

01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:47.060
I don't say yeah fish. I don't know fish. All I know about fish is that any girl I ever dated that a fish bumper sticker was a bummer

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.500
She might have been a born again Christian, you know

01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:04.180
Connected those dots I feel like that you wrote that weeks ago. We're hoping that was amazing

01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:11.140
I have only met you twice on the show and I've come to hate you for how fucking funny you are

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:15.300
Well, have you seen the rest of development? You should have hated him years ago

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:21.820
I just assumed that was a factory of geniuses. It turns out it's just one lunatic who's charming and funny as hell

01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:27.340
Like yeah, he's just like you have one liner. It's just like you're like what do you know? I'm not gonna make funnier for that

01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:29.340
So

01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:39.620
How do we how do we play Dungeons & Dragons Spencer? Can you make all six of us play can we do some some some some some NPCs up here?

01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:49.540
Yeah, I'll let you guys play. No, no, no everybody's drop acid and we'll just go ahead and play

01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:52.660
It's gonna get real

01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:58.460
Spencer is that possible to throw the whole gang in it? Yeah, I mean everything's possible with imagination. Fuck yeah

01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:06.380
All right, I was in love with Mitch, but you got you got supplanted by Spencer

01:31:06.380 --> 01:31:22.340
What supplanted what does that mean? I mean, it's something you get from supplantation

01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:29.940
That's why it's funny Jesus who said it. Well, he jumped on the supplantation. Yeah, the supplantation was great

01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.500
That's what he said

01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:36.500
I didn't like it the first time

01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:41.420
Spencer break it down for us. Wait, okay

01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:47.300
You don't know the rage of a dungeon master

01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:51.740
Happy new year

01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:53.900
Last year on Harmontown

01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:57.980
Our heroes were near the end of their quest after an all-out

01:31:57.980 --> 01:32:04.700
Maybe more like a half-assed assault on Admiral Darkstar. They murdered him

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:12.700
Intentionally activating a massive golem down but not out sharpie became a gas and entered the golems

01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:20.300
Working with the gang attacking the metal monster from both the outside and in and with some timely help from a venture

01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:25.580
The Hawk they eventually managed to decapitate and deactivate the arcane machine

01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:33.500
But Christopher took turn for the worst vomiting on and grabbing a strange glowing stone from inside the golem as well as

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:35.500
Onto doors and such

01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:41.220
Together Chris and more a knock the golem all down and then Christopher began to vomit some more

01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:49.380
After realizing their exit was blocked by lava Sharpie left from the window of a several hundred foot tall spire

01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:53.460
Protected with the feather fall, but leaving his allies high and dry

01:32:53.460 --> 01:33:00.740
Luckily the savvy rogue acted quickly lassoing Sharpie with his rope and reeling him in so the party could escape together

01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:05.660
But as the realization of their valiant deeds began to settle over our heroes

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:10.620
Christopher broke the strange tension by strangely and without provocation

01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:14.300
Drying his dagger and deep boning his own crotch

01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:18.900
Sending the dismembered member onto the snowy cold ground

01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:25.060
As blood poured out into the snow the phallus suffered from high-speed shrinkage

01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:31.420
But why and what now and Christopher you lose two charisma points

01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:41.460
Wait, I don't want to

01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:44.480
Can we not have fucking Duncan trustal

01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:46.480
I

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:51.860
So my dick is gone and I've lost two charisma

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:59.240
Yeah, until such time as it can be reattached and restored it's laying in the snow, but you cut your dick off

01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:01.240
You lose two charisma points

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:04.240
It's a house roll. It's been working so far

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:08.240
It comes up a lot more than you might expect

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:14.960
Of a vibe a vibe gets put out, you know when you don't have a very charismatic dick

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:21.120
Yeah, I got shit at least I can wear a kilt without fear of I was thinking

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:28.160
Someone could be more rain and then someone could be Avenger and then I'd only have like one other person to really worry about

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:33.760
Yeah, I mean is that fine with everybody here

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:39.400
But I don't have Harris be a mole Rainer. Yeah, yeah, Mitch your Avenger again

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:44.760
Yeah, then I'll all work Steve a G and then okay, that's your steve will do it. He's played this

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.480
I've never played this. It's cool. Every every one's cool man. Yeah

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:56.600

This is a big moment for you knocked over the golem you you got out of this tower

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.600
You think you killed the guy you got a glowing stone as dicks chopped off is

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:26.480
Emotions are running high. What's going on? I

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.440
Got heartburn

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:35.880
We did it we did it. I mean at we I guess I guess we

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:42.080
Accomplished our mission you guys it. I don't know why I have such an empty feeling and in me right now

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:47.960
It's you see Christopher. He's starting to get worse as eyes. They're garling wide and grazed. They're kind of

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:53.360
Yeah, maybe rolling around a bit. Yeah

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:59.680
Just a bit perfect. It also says here. I can spend my head all the way around. I mean sure watch this

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:02.640
What if I fucking did that?

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:11.720
It's a podcast you can does anybody have any healing abilities or anything that I don't I feel super weird guys

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:15.320
I have wild empathy. I can feel that for you. Yeah

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:20.800
Yeah, do you see how horrible and weird I feel? Yeah, I'm sorry about that

01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:25.240
We should I be his chopped off dick

01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:35.860
It's the role you were born to play I mean sure

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:39.080
Joke right

01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:42.120
I vomit acid on

01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:44.680
Well, not my own chopped off dick

01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:47.720
But I vomit acid on Mulraine

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:53.880
But there was a little clue just now when he said that's a joke right was it? I mean if Steve Agee wants to be his dick

01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:56.920
I mean that's his prerogative. I've always wanted that

01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:04.800
It's just not much of a speaking role, but but you do have two points of credit. Yeah, yeah, I've got two charisma

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:13.560
It's a Steve it's it's kind of a small part. All right, we'll find another we'll find something

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.360
Low hanging fruit. Oh

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:27.020
Was that a play on words if you like should we cauterize or

01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:34.500
Oh, he just vomited acid on Mulraine. I just vomited acid on Mulraine and said fuck you it burns

01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:40.260
It burns the flesh. Is this in accordance with special instructions you've been given because you're you're acting weird

01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:46.660
You're that's pretty meta gaming. All right. Okay guys. I'm sorry. I did that. I didn't mean to oh

01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:52.780
I feel weird and almost as if I don't feel like myself

01:37:52.780 --> 01:38:01.300
And upon those words you see you hear the clank of plate mail and you spy the golden armor of a

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:09.260
Warrior figure perhaps some sort of cleric of Pallore upon closer inspection. It's your old old compatriots

01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:12.060
Morris gold bright

01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:18.340
Morris hey, how's it going?

01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:22.220
Wait, I've been hiding. I

01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:25.860
Shoot laser beam eyes Adam

01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:32.100
You shoot laser beam eyes everybody looks as laser beams fire from your eyes

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:36.220
The hell we strike Morris gold bright

01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:40.020
But uh, he doesn't seem affected for whatever reason sorry about that

01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:45.740
I draw my sword and hold it up to Chris de Burgh and say what's what's the deal Jack?

01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:52.180
Hey, hey, I'm cool. I don't know what's going on. That's not you vomited ass dude

No, you have laser beam eyes. No, trust me. I don't look at him. I

01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:05.020

01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:24.900
I'm not gonna wait for you to get good at burning me with your eyes. No, I'm like I ain't giant. I'm fighting it

01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:31.860
Can I use my when I get a turn? I want to use my armlet of spring which can shoot thorny vines 20 feet

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:37.660
To protect her and snare enemies. I'm gonna obviously opting to ensnare this

01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:40.260
frenemy

01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:46.420
You ensnare the frenemy and you see a small thing fall out of his hand as he gets grasped

01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:52.100
By the vines the grasping vines. I I toss a I toss a crayon into his mouth

01:39:56.740 --> 01:39:58.740
It hits

01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:07.500
So now he's tied up drop the thing what is that thing I venture Avenger go get that thing. Well, I said it's a little thing

01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:11.420
He didn't say that

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:18.540
So vendor gets no Avenger. Oh, it's me. Oh, yeah. Oh, well, I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna put it in my beak

01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:25.740
That's for sure. I don't think it's a dick. Is there's no he dropped something from his hand something from his hand. Yeah

01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:30.020
This is a game. This is this we were playing a game

01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:36.620
Sorry, that's meta gaming. I'm still beat behind understanding. So I I'm gonna pick it up. Yeah, no

01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:38.620
I'm gonna pick it up and

01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:40.300
I'm going to

01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:42.300
Bring it back to you. Yeah

01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:47.340
Wow the bar is no

01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:54.260
You you see it's in the Avengers clutches. It's a small

01:40:54.260 --> 01:41:00.820
It's that purple glowing stone that you saw in the golem as you as you as you look at it

01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:06.900
It seems to pull slightly and then it shatters and upon shattering. Oh, I start reading a thing

01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:10.740
Purple, are you going to propose to somebody?

01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:18.260
Why don't don't touch my thigh, okay as it shatters purple energy swirls around you before

01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:23.940
Exploding outwards in an intense burst you're shaken and feel sick as if your very soul was attacked

01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:31.440
You feel exhausted instantly as if you haven't slept for days and then a rumbling overtakes all other sounds as you see the black keep

01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:35.660
Crumbling into itself collapsing and imploding before falling

01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:40.620
Disappearing entirely into a pit below the surface really nice picking that thing up

01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:43.940
Really sorry guys

01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:52.260
That sounds good, but the black keep has destroyed itself. It seems that way. Do I feel more like myself you feel kind of?

01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:58.540
Stronger I toss the vines aside

01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:04.260
That happens you burst forth from the vines. Did you guys see what I just did?

01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:14.900
You're on fucking friend probation right now man, okay, I got it. I'm sorry. I don't I don't mean to all right really

01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:24.300
Okay, okay, so so the stone fell out of Christopher's hand adventure. Got it. It broke the black keep

01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:29.900
Just dissolved and crumbled and went away. Yeah, I'm sorry to keep track of I know I

01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:35.540
Look at everybody and say well gentlemen and ladies. We did it

01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:38.260
I guess this is the end of the adventure

01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:41.820
Seems like we

01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:43.420
You know, I

01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:49.220
Maybe there's some moment where we say hey that all worked out except Chris lost his dick and then we all laugh

01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:59.860
All right, I I just in a moment of whimsy go and pick up the severed penis go in just just because I

01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:02.140
I'm going to I grab Mulraine's

01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:05.260
Craft kit and I just try to crudely so

01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:36.700

Don't try to reattach the dick to a guy who is possessed

01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:06.620
They do see that around here I

01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:11.620

All right, does he really throw it into the abyss what do you want to try and stop him?

Okay, yeah, he throws it in the pit

Try as you might you try to grab it out of his hand or maybe slap it out of his hand

01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:04.180
But he throws it into the heart of the pit itself

01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:11.460
Fuck duck intrusive. So so can I

01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:15.180

Somebody in the crowd you yelled you can regenerate it. Is that true?

01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:23.060
Who

01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:27.860

We got to restrain this guy's yeah

01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:42.580
Okay, I look at Sharpie and I go Sharpie. You're right put the vines around me again

01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:45.380
I'm not I'm a danger to myself and everyone around me

01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:49.140
You already got out of those

01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:54.660
Yeah, I have a thing called a feat called still spell. Yeah, so I should yeah still spell

01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:56.620
That means you don't have to move to cast a spell

01:45:56.620 --> 01:46:02.980
Yeah, it's yeah, I was yeah, I should mention I switched your guys as character sheets over a pathfinder

01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:04.820
Yeah, thank you. So

01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:06.820
Everyone's is all revamped

01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:10.500
I didn't try so hard with Jeff's because I thought you'd want to customize it yourself

01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:14.820
All right, so I haven't had a chance, but I love that I gave some I gave some options

01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:27.300
But it's all up for grabs everyone's playing pathfinder, so I'm not a dungeon master anymore. I'm a game master

01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:32.380
Maybe I should use reduced person on him. I mean at least that'll reduce his person

01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:39.740
I get it already been reduced think I'll make your sever dick would look now

01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:46.700
Maybe I'll try unless it's too late

01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:54.140
We'll try charm person on him. Yeah, see if that overpowers the possession he

01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:56.860
He seems pretty friendly

01:46:57.260 --> 01:46:59.260
It's working. Hey, what's up?

01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:01.260
I

01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:07.380
Go up and I

01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:10.020
Gravel him like an angry dad at a fish concert

01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:16.100
And I say like what's it gonna be man with the rage of a father you clutching

01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:24.700
What is it gonna be Jack

01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:35.060
So I use my fucking super strength and just toss him into the abyss

01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:42.700
What the duck and trust and I say there's something down there for you

01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:51.180
Using your supernatural strength you hug the gnome into the pit

01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:53.180
I

01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:55.420
Am so sorry

01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:02.740
Somebody grab me I reach out and grab his foot

01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:10.700
Where you would I would if you didn't I

01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:16.540
Mean that's not accurate. That's not doesn't make any sense. It doesn't happen

01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:21.660
I just oh he didn't it didn't work. No. Yeah, wait. No, but he's going in the abyss. Oh, yeah

01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:23.660
Yeah, he's going sailing into this shit

01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:27.820
I'll suck your dick in hell

01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:32.940
That's a cliffhanger right

01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:36.020
No, I'm gonna save Jeff first. Okay

01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:42.140
How are you gonna manage that by men and by

01:48:42.140 --> 01:48:44.460
I

01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:49.420
You're gonna make the utterance. I'm gonna I'm gonna now dig this buddy

01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:57.740
Shit, where's that rod that I had that had the button on top of it. I'll tell you where my rod is

01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:04.580
But that's that bunstaff got melted in the law for Christ because

01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:11.500
Because because if you recall you had to save quark after he was raping the robo spider. I

01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:17.260
Know that your subtle implication is that everything that's happening to us we deserve

01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:25.900
But it's it's not easy to play Dungeons & Dragons, it's like it's like, you know, you make weird decisions

01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:30.340
I

01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:34.860
I I'm thinking I'll use my teleport cape. Is it what's the situation? He's he's

01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:41.740
The abyss is like a is it like a portal or is it like a hole in the ground like the ice like broke and fell through

01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:45.580
And he's tumbling down it. Yeah, I guess I got it

01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:51.300
I got well, how many feather falls can I cast you pretty much out of feather falls that you used

01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:53.780
The last I mean you got one left

01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:57.340
But you used everything almost of your level one spells already

01:49:57.340 --> 01:50:04.940
But I got a full charge of my teleport cape. Yeah. Yeah, so I teleport into the mid air aside my friend

01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:09.660
And grab ahold of him and feather fall that happens you grab them and

01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:19.660
Yeah, it's 10 o'clock to give us a good line and maybe Avenger might do some Robin Williams a

01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:23.500
Button button on this. Maybe you should turn to Avenger

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:28.700
Then I think we need a good dick jump to get us out. Yeah, maybe maybe ever since be ready Avenger

01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:34.900
Going down

01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:38.740
Yeah

01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:40.940
I didn't sell it

01:50:41.060 --> 01:50:43.060
I didn't want to I don't

01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:54.620
So so he's got a hold of me at midair. Yeah. Yeah, thank you. Are we now falling together into the slowly though feather style? Can you read my mind?

01:50:54.620 --> 01:51:10.780
Do your little lowest late voice over ask ask a lot of rhetorical questions about you've got me. Who's got you?

01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:17.940
