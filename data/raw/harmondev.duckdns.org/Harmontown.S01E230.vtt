{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:10.000\nFrom San Francisco, California, the beautiful Marines Memorial.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:22.000\nIt's San Francisco's sketch fest, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:38.000\nLet's bring the stage Spencer Crittenden. Spencer.\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:42.000\nHello. Hello Spencer. How's it going?\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:54.000\nAll right, in the mayor of Harmontown, you know him, you like him, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:58.000\nI thought maybe there was no one up there. I was going to get mad and walk out.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:11.000\nI was told the house was full. Thank you so much, San Francisco, for having us.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:15.000\nNo, I'm hooting and hollering for you. I hope you're having a good sketch fest.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:29.000\nJeff just walked off the job. It's okay.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:33.000\nYeah, we are here in the Marine Memorial Theater and Hotel.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:37.000\nI guess there's rooms here. Is anybody staying here at the Marine Memorial?\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:41.000\nI have. I've stayed here a bunch of times. I was talking to them.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:44.000\nBut while they didn't respond, I tried to jump in there.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:47.000\nHe came in real fast. I don't know if they had a chance.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:51.000\nBecause normally you go, if anyone's staying here, there'd be an instant, woo!\n\n01:51.000 --> 02:00.000\nYeah, I guess. But it's a small enough place that the one person that stayed here is probably, there he is.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:05.000\nWho is here from Al Toloma? See, nobody. Nobody.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:09.000\nWhat floor are you on, sir?\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:11.000\nOh, he won't say.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:15.000\nYeah, because it's a horrible creepy thing to ask about.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:19.000\nHe's a private man. I use a liar.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:23.000\nYeah, well, I was trying to figure out just by using Wikipedia.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:28.000\nI was like, oh, Marine, you get nervous when you get into a veteran area.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:30.000\nYou don't want to offend or do anything.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:35.000\nYou wouldn't want to stand in a room that was sacred to a branch of the government\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:40.000\nand just talk about your fucking self and how many people were at your inauguration.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:42.000\nYou don't want to...\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:47.000\nYou want to respect...\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:49.000\nI'm doing exactly what he did.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:53.000\nIf there's like Marines under the stage, like in sarcophagi.\n\n02:53.000 --> 03:00.000\nI don't know if it's like Skyrim where there's just like soldier ghosts are going to go,\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:04.000\nlike you fucking defiled me, now fight me.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:12.000\nAfter us, there's going to be an all-womens podcast that's going to get way more people.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:14.000\nSad.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:16.000\nApologize. Sad.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:18.000\nYou guys saw the chart.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:21.000\nMy favorite chart was the one I think everybody saw.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:24.000\nIt was just based on the transit numbers.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:30.000\nIt was like the first Obama inauguration and then there was something else.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:34.000\nAnd then the second Obama inauguration and then the...\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:36.000\nWhat was the Women's March? It was the something else.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:38.000\nAnd then the second Obama inauguration.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:39.000\nIt was something else.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:40.000\nIt was something else.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:43.000\nYou ladies ought to be proud of yourselves.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:45.000\nYou were something else out there.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:48.000\nYou bedazzled democracy.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:53.000\nYou went, girl.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:55.000\nI conjugated a little phrase.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:57.000\nAnd then there was a visual graphic.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:00.000\nSo there were two Obama faces that were identical going,\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:03.000\nand then there was like a female symbol in the middle of them going,\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:07.000\nyay, and then there was like a little grumpy Donald.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:10.000\nAnd there was a thing between the grumpy Donald which was on the bottom\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:14.000\nand the bottom most thing above the whatever.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:17.000\nBecause you look and you see the grumpy Donald which was on the bottom.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nLike how many people rode the rails that day in D.C.?\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nWhatever, 11 or whatever.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:25.000\nAnd then right above it you're squinting.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:27.000\nYou're like, what is that graphic?\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:30.000\nAnd it's like your average work day.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:32.000\nThat was my favorite graphic.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\nAnd I don't care if it's a lie.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:40.000\nI love, yes, fake news.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nJust put fake news in a rock and just throw it.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:47.000\nIt's probably not untrue.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:49.000\nBut I don't care anymore.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:54.000\nYou go on Twitter which is the greatest place to be in the world\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nbecause you're going to get so much done there.\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:00.000\nBecause it's like, let's just keep sitting on Twitter.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.000\nI'm not saying let's get off of Twitter.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:04.000\nI'm just sarcastically berating myself.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:05.000\nWhy am I doing this?\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:08.000\nYou get on Twitter and you're just like, hey, I feel like a piece of shit\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nand I want to fucking blow everything up.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:11.000\nFuck you.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:12.000\nEveryone go fuck yourself.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:13.000\nYou're all fucking stupid.\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:14.000\nWhy have you done this to me?\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:15.000\nFuck off.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:22.000\nAnd then there's people that just go like, better than Hilary.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:25.000\nAnd then you fucking find yourself arguing with them.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:28.000\nWell, meanwhile, there's people going like, amen, brother, high five,\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:29.000\nand you don't respond to them.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:34.000\nIt's like my life has become community.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:39.000\nNow I'm bad at show running anarchy.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nI should just fucking be thanking people as we go down.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:43.000\nLike, thank you.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:44.000\nThank you.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:45.000\nThank you.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:49.000\nI'm glad that you also feel that this is fucked up.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:53.000\nBut I found tonight, Dustin Marshall, our producer,\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:59.000\nturned us on to this Twitter account that is at Trump underscore regrets.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:03.000\nAnd it feels so bad good.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:08.000\nIt's just retweets everybody that's just saying to Donald Trump like,\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nwhat the fuck are you doing?\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nI voted for you.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:14.000\nAnd it just makes you just feel good.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nAnd you shouldn't feel good.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nBut it's like, my favorite ones are not the people that are like,\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:20.000\nwhat the fuck are you doing?\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nYou promised you'd throw out the Mexicans.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:25.000\nAnd I'm like, OK, that's not.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.000\nThey're going to be a return customer.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:30.000\nThey're going to be like, all right, now that's better.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:31.000\nThey're taken care of.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:34.000\nBut I like the people that are like, why are you bitching\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:37.000\nabout the New York Times, you pussy?\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:40.000\nI voted for you because I'm a man.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:41.000\nI like that.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nI'm like, yeah, fucking yeah.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:48.000\nBecause that picture that you saw in your history book of Mussolini\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:53.000\nand his friends at the partway through World War II,\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nbecause Italy didn't make it all the way to the end,\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:00.000\neven though they literally invented the word fascism,\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\neven though Hitler kind of nailed it.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\nOh, hi, Spencer.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\nHey, guys.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:09.000\nYeah, Hitler was great.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:10.000\nAt fascism.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nHitler was great at fascism.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nHe was better than Mussolini.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:17.000\nAlso a terrific painter.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:24.000\nThere is the classic photo from the end of fascism in Italy.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:28.000\nIt is Mussolini and his various friends, his entourage,\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:33.000\nhis turtle and his Mikey or whatever their names are,\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:38.000\ndrama and e-pants.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:41.000\nAnd they're upside down because they've been dragged through\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:44.000\nthe market and they've been hung up like meat.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:48.000\nAnd the people standing outside of them going, hey,\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nlook at this, those aren't liberals.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:53.000\nThose are disgruntled former fascists.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nThe liberals are dead.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:56.000\nThey're in prison.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:57.000\nThey've left.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nThey were rounded up and shot.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:03.000\nI mean, fascism just eats through your country like a cancer\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:06.000\nand then it eats itself because there's nothing left to eat\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nand it does it in record time.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nIt's a modern disease.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nIt shouldn't be dismissed.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:13.000\nMuch like anorexia.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:16.000\nThere's people that dismiss eating disorders\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:20.000\nbecause a bad person will go like, oh, I can't find\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nan anorexic in Africa so we should dismiss this.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:28.000\nNo, it's a modern thing that's germane to this particular\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:29.000\ncontext.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:33.000\nFascism is only possible in a modern context,\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:37.000\na post-industrial context where it's like people that get\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:41.000\npoor, that have been promised utopia, they start to get\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nfreaked out and disgruntled.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\nMulticulturalism starts to scare them.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:49.000\nThis Christmas isn't going to be like last Christmas.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:52.000\nThat's the first thing that happens.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:53.000\nThat's basically what it is.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:56.000\nIt's like, I got a BB gun last year and this year I got\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:57.000\nOptimus Prime.\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:59.000\nWhat the fuck's happening?\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nThat's the beginning of fascism.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:02.000\nThat's the potting soil.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:06.000\nYou just made me sad about George Michael.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:10.000\nThe very next day.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:14.000\nI was thinking Optimus Prime is way better than a BB gun.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nThat's what I was thinking, yeah.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nOptimus Prime was my generation's BB gun.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nI don't know what I said about a BB gun.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:23.000\nBut anyways, people get disgruntled, dissatisfied,\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:27.000\nand then you can't blame the funny guy with the funny\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:31.000\nhair that ends up clowning around and distracts everybody.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:32.000\nIt's all of us.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nWe're all to blame.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:37.000\nIt just becomes this weird thing.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nIt's an infection that sets in.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:40.000\nWhat is my point?\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:41.000\nWhat are we going to do?\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nI don't know what the fuck we're going to do.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:46.000\nWhy do you need to hear this from me?\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:49.000\nYou've been thinking about it all day.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nWe're all watching it happen.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:55.000\nWe just keep feeling like what are we supposed to do?\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:56.000\nOur legs are twitching.\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:00.000\nDo I grab a rock?\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nDo the rock do?\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nWho would I throw it at?\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:07.000\nDo I wait until there's someone to throw it at?\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:10.000\nIt might be my neighbor.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:13.000\nAre they coming from my housekeeper's family?\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nAre they coming from my friends?\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:20.000\nWait, let's talk about that for a second.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:24.000\nI'd like to see some papers.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.000\nI mean, it's a thing.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:29.000\nJerry Brown, our beloved governor,\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nhe makes a speech and he says,\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:34.000\nlisten, man, they can't come in here.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:35.000\nThey can't take anybody.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nIt's not going to happen.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nAnd then in the same speech, he's like,\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:42.000\nplus silver lining, monorail money!\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:43.000\nHe's psyched.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:46.000\nI don't understand.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:49.000\nAll of us, I think everybody is walking around\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:52.000\nin weird days because we're kind of like,\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:56.000\nwell, we've never, ever, ever, ever lived in this world.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nWe've never lived in a world that feels to us\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nlike it's in a history book.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nYou just open up your phone and it's just like,\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:08.000\noh, all Goodwill's are closed.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nWait, I was about to buy pants\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nand then the head of Goodwill then starts\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:19.000\na different account and goes, fuck the police!\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nAnd he's like, everybody follow the head of Goodwill\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:24.000\nand then it's gone.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nAnd then meanwhile, all of you are like,\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:29.000\noh, I got fired because I followed the Goodwill guy.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nI don't know what to do now.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nWe're freaking the fuck out.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nWe don't know what to do.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nWhen do you move?\n\n11:37.000 -->

16:40.000\nIt's just...\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nHere's the thing.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:44.000\nHere was what I was going to talk about.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:47.000\nThis is this popular thing now that we're all encountering.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:50.000\nWe're all saying, oh, King George is mad.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nHe just ate his own shit on TV.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nHe just pulled out a doo-doo and said,\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:55.000\nthis isn't a doo-doo.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nIt's a candy bar and ate it.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nAnd we're going like, he's mentally ill.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:02.000\nWe should get him out of the most powerful desk\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nwe have available to any of us.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:07.000\nHe's just ate shit.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:10.000\nHe might mistake anything for anything.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:13.000\nWe're the most people.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:14.000\nWhat do we do?\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:18.000\nAnd you can express that as a person who maybe\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:21.000\nhated Hillary Clinton, maybe voted,\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:24.000\nloved Bernie Sanders, maybe you loved Jill Stein.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:28.000\nMaybe you far as fucking weird fever dream second\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nthought Donald Trump was a good idea,\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:34.000\nbut by and large, you could just be a person\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:39.000\njust saying, OK, now I think this seems,\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:44.000\ngiven the stakes involved with this corporation,\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:49.000\nI think we ought to examine all of our options\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:52.000\nand just look at what you've been doing.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:56.000\nAnd honestly, I know you don't have to\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\ntake your hands from behind your back.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:01.000\nThere's no rule that says you have to.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nIt's weird that you won't.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:06.000\nAnd we'd like to see what's in your hands, Damien.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nWe'd like to see what's in your hands.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:13.000\nBecause you seem very proud that there's nothing\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:14.000\nin your hands.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:17.000\nAnd you said you'd show your hands if you won.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:21.000\nAnd then you said, I'll show my hands after the audit.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nAnd then you said, I'll show my hands never.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:26.000\nAnd then your fucking weird nutcracker\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:32.000\ndressed decepticon went on Meet the Press\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:35.000\nand said, OK, now he's going to show his hands on Sunday\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nmorning after brunch.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nAnd then you said, no, I'm not.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nAnd I don't know what the fuck is in your fucking hands.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nYou're the fucking president.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:45.000\nThe fuck is in your tax report?\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:48.000\nSorry, you distracted me.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nThe tiny hands thing, I mean, whatever.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nIf it gets to him, let's do it.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:56.000\nBut I'm like, if that's a small dick thing,\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nthen fuck everybody.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:01.000\nI think it's just fun because he hates it.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:04.000\nLike, whatever he hates, just pile on.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nSpencer and I were talking about it earlier.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nIs it better?\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nLike, I don't know about you guys.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:13.000\nI fantasize that if I met Donald Trump, what would I do?\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:15.000\nWould I fuck with him?\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\nWould I try to just?\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nI would tear a mattress tag off of him.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nYou're in soaked mattress tag.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:29.000\nThey got those videos, and they're just going to keep him.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nRussia's going to make Trump do their bidding\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:34.000\nbecause they got the pee-pee videos.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:37.000\nThey're fucking geniuses.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nBut who among his followers wouldn't just start\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nsaying pee's delicious?\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nLike, why wouldn't they?\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:46.000\nWhen I saw that thing, I was like, no, that fits perfectly.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:50.000\nThe story is that he paid hookers to pee on the Obama's bed.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:53.000\nI'm like, I'm running my video.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:58.000\nI'm running my very easy-to-run Trump simulator,\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:03.000\nTrump fan simulator, which is 16 kilobytes.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:09.000\nAnd I'm going, fucking, hip hop hooray.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:12.000\nLike, that's what I want in my Trump.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:16.000\nI want him to pay hookers to pee on the Obama's hotel bed.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:20.000\nIf he's gobbling the pee and going, like, I love pee.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:24.000\nLike, maybe, maybe.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nLike, maybe it would flip them.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nWe're waiting for his fans to flip.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:31.000\nHis fans don't flip.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:35.000\nHis fans are a fucking wine stain.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:39.000\nLike, they don't turn into an ice cream stain.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nThey don't, like, there's no...\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:44.000\nHis fans have committed to such a degree\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:49.000\nof psychologically criminal fucking treasonous\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:51.000\ntoxicity.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:54.000\nThere's no fucking anything.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:57.000\nThey have committed so long ago to the idea\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:00.000\nthat they are simply sick and tired\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:04.000\nof being told they're stupid and wrong.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:08.000\nAnd so, like, proving them stupid and proving them wrong\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:12.000\nis like, it's like shining sun on Birdman.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:16.000\nHe was a superhero character in the 70s.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:20.000\nHe got his strength from the sun. I should have picked something else.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:23.000\nIs there a chance that somebody, like, as a fan of our show,\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:26.000\nbrought their Trump-supporting father or mother here,\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nand they're just sitting there really uncomfortably right now?\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:33.000\nI would show anybody in here that was willing to,\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:36.000\nin the interest of connection and stuff,\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:40.000\nI would offer you the utmost verbal and psychological\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nand spiritual protection if you were willing to come up here\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nand be a voice for the other.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:47.000\nI understand absolutely if you don't want to,\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nand don't force yourself if you're on the fence\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nbecause the truth is we're all, you know,\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nlike being on the fence doesn't count.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:55.000\nBut if somebody was passionate,\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:59.000\nokay, sir, so if you want to come up here and...\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nI didn't know that was going to happen.\n\n22:01.000 -->

total respect for coming up there\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nand coming up here and, like,\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:32.000\nthis is a safety zone where we're not going to, you know,\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\njust take a giant cramp on you.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:37.000\nYeah, but also we can't make any promises for the audience,\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nwho is a group of uncontrollable people.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:41.000\nNo, shit got mutinous out there pretty quick\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nbecause there's a rumbling.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nYeah, I'm actually lied,\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nbut I have a solution.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:51.000\nYeah, this is what I thought was the case.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nThis is your...\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nYou're being rude for not being a Trump supporter.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nYeah, that's what's happening.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nWould you call your solution final?\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nBecause you might still count.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nUnder the circumstances, I would say no.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nI started a software project to end suicide\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nwithin our lifetime.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nAll right, well, you high-roaded us.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:14.000\nWe can't...\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:18.000\nI came up here to help inner-city children.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nI pretended I was a Trump fan.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:21.000\nOkay, well, tell us about it.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:22.000\nThat's fine.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:24.000\nOkay, so...\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:27.000\nWe have a website called letsandsuicide.com\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:29.000\nand basically we're going to provide\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\na machine learning algorithm\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nthat will monitor your social media output\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:36.000\nand determine if you're in a depressive or romantic episode.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nAnd then from there,\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nwe have a version 1.5.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nEasy, easy, steady.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nWe have a version 1.5 where\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:49.000\na medical health professional will get in touch with you\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nif it thinks that you are...\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:52.000\ndepressive.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:53.000\nHold up, same.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nSo you're saying that you're...\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nThis audience has heard elevator pitches\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nfor start-ups before.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:06.000\nI'm not saying it's fair.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:08.000\nI'm just saying this is what I'm realizing.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nThis is true.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nYeah, it's non-profit.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nWe're incorporating next week.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:19.000\nWell, yeah, I mean, that was kind of the inspiration for it.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nYou know how to win them over at these fickle bunch\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nis to tell us what personal investment\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nyou have in this.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nI have a lot of...\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:29.000\nI have, in personal experience,\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\none of my family members committing suicide,\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nbut I have several friends who have.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nAnd I think it's a major problem,\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nand I think that we have the technology to take care of it.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nWe have ten versions.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nCan you explain how that works?\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nBecause I think a lot of people are going,\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nwait, so if I...\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nIt's only you sign up for...\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nYeah, you sign up.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nRight now this is just an idea,\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nI just got home from my job\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nat Universal Studios Theme Park.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:59.000\nThe T-Rex's balls needed to be cleaned again.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nI want to fucking kill myself.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nAnd then this app goes,\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nboop, boop, boop, boop.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nYeah, there's a big,\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\ngiant monolithic computer system.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:11.000\nBut really, I'm being silly,\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:13.000\nbut we need...\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nYou have to sign up to this...\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nYes, it's opt-in.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.000\nYou opt-in.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nSo you're monitoring everybody that says...\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nNo, it's only your public social media output,\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nwhatever you want to provide the actual...\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nSo if you feel like you might be suicidal,\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nyou go to this.com\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:31.000\nand say monitor me and tell me that I'm\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\npossibly suicidal?\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nHopefully you would do that before you got to that point.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\nIt's for people like myself who have mental health issues.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nYeah, I really don't...\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\nYeah, obviously the logical part of your brain,\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.000\nand I'm not knowing enough\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nabout that mind state,\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nexcept that it does deserve\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\ncare.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nI don't want to trump over anybody,\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nbut the obvious kind of\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\ninternal logic comedic mechanisms\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\ngo like, okay, so just logically,\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nI'm either A,\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nhappy, therefore,\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nnot really anticipating a future\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nsuicide, and therefore not\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nsigning up for this, or I'm B,\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nsuicidal, and therefore probably also\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nnot taking steps to...\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nRight, well we'll have an emergency contact\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nsystem, that's one of the ideas with the app.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nSo if you ever need to talk to anybody,\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:19.000\nthere'll be a volunteer.\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:21.000\nAnd so I would say to the asshole\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nme that just said that,\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nwell, and you confirm\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nif this is right or not, the suicidal\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:29.000\nideation, and the states\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:31.000\nof mind that come with it, for some people\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.000\nare actually...\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:35.000\nWe can dismiss them because we're like,\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nwell I've never been that sad,\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:39.000\ngive me a break, but for some people\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nit's so chronic and so constant\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nthat actually some people do have to live\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nlike skipping on that pond\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.000\nand that those people can go\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:49.000\nin a clear state of mind, like this is\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:51.000\ngoing to happen again, history's taught me\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:53.000\nand so I'm putting this padlock\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:55.000\non the fridge. Yeah, I myself am\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:57.000\nbipolar, and bipolar one,\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.000\nand I...\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:01.000\nBasically... Thank you,\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:03.000\nyou can multiply that applause\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\ntimes two because... Exactly,\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:07.000\nI have two states of mind, I'm actually a\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:09.000\nGemini, you got\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nwhoops from the half of the bipolar\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\npeople who are currently manic.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nExactly, perfect.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nIs that offensive?\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:19.000\nNo, not offensive at all.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:21.000\nHe got the most whoops ever, period.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nLet's send suicide.com\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.000\nNice.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nOh, so you need volunteers?\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nWell, for the first version of the app,\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nwe are basically taking pro bono work,\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nthe first version is 0.1.0\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nwhich is dedicated to Carrie Fisher,\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nmental health advocate,\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.000\nspace princess.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nWell,\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\ngive us a taste of the suicide statistics\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\njust till we understand, because we don't\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nthink about this stuff as... Aren't they\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:51.000\nreally leading cause and male death?\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nLike they're up there, right? Yeah, I mean\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nAlaska is like huge issues, I don't have the numbers on me,\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nI'm like a Trump, so I just come up here\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\ncompletely off the dome.\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nNo, it's okay, we'd rather you\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:05.000\nsay you don't know, but it's big,\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nit's a big deal, it's not like\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:09.000\nit's not like your pet cause\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:11.000\nthat's like little tiny, little bitty-bitty\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nthing in the face of breast cancer\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nor prostate cancer.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nWell, it's funny you mentioned that, because\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\nversion 10 seeks to end cancer with an\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\narseus. Whoa!\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:23.000\nGeez!\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nI jumped like versions 2 through 9,\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:27.000\nbut version 10... So this thing is slowly becoming\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nSkyNet? Absolutely.\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:31.000\nIt starts by preventing you from\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nkilling yourself, then it prevents your cancer,\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nand then the version 4.0\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nis like, why aren't you a computer?\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nYeah, basically.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nLike you post on Facebook,\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nI had a great day, and the thing is like\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\neep, eep, eep.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nA siren goes off over your head.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nYeah.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nI have a question, and\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nI'm not trying to be provocative here.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:55.000\nYou seem like a very sympathetic, empathetic guy.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nLike you're doing this...\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nWhich sounds like a very\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nselfless, very noble thing.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:03.000\nI'm\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nnot trying to be a dick, and I know that...\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:07.000\nNo, please. I need feedback, so...\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nWell, I'm just wanting to...\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nI have friends that are very smart,\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nvery emotionally sensitive,\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nintelligent people\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nwho believe\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\npolitically in things that I just don't\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nreally quite grasp, because\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.000\nI don't see the empathy in their politics.\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nI don't see the\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nempathetic part of it. We become too polarized, and\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nthe problem with the U.S. system is that we have\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\ntwo parties, we need a third party to balance out\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:33.000\nthe issue.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nSo I also started a new political party.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nWell, Trump...\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nYeah, I noticed you didn't get paid for that.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.000\nWe're all out of ideas, so...\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:43.000\nTrump has already vowed to end all political parties\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:45.000\nby 10 years from now.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:47.000\nOh, shit. We've got to work fast, I guess.\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:49.000\nPolitical parties have been running the country\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nfor 300 years with no results. Sad!\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\nIt's called New Rally.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:57.000\nYou can find us at\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.000\nnewrally.us.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\nNew Rally, you think neutrality, you think\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\nnew reality.

space.\n\n01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:17.760\nIt's open earth in this tunnel at least.\n\n01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:24.520\nLooking around, you see the walls seem to be made of natural wood or living wood.\n\n01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:28.440\nIt seems like you're inside of a giant tree.\n\n01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:31.880\nHey, you guys, I found another room.\n\n01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.880\nThey can't

character, he was a Japanese gadget fan.\n\n01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:58.840\nIs the whole big enough for me, Kettle One and Rogue, to fit through as well?\n\n01:35:58.840 --> 01:35:59.840\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:03.320\nI can fit in any hole.\n\n01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:05.280\nThat's what she just said.\n\n01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:10.800\nI didn't hear it, not because I'm committing to my character, because I'm a bad listener.\n\n01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:11.800\nI can't.\n\n01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:12.800\nDid I can fit in any hole?\n\n01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.160\nYou went to golf nine holes?\n\n01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.160\nWhat?\n\n01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:19.400\nI didn't think the Kettle One was getting me that quick.\n\n01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:20.920\nI said, I can fit in any hole.\n\n01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:21.920\nOh, you can fit in any hole.\n\n01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:22.920\nOkay.\n\n01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:23.920\nAll right.\n\n01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:24.920\nThat's what she said.\n\n01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:32.480\nLet's, let's, let's all charge through that hole and join, what's your name, Gerard?\n\n01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:33.480\nGerard?\n\n01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:34.480\nGerard.\n\n01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:35.480\nOkay.\n\n01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:36.480\nYou do that.\n\n01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:39.360\nYou also find yourself within this great tree.\n\n01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:42.600\nOh, well, hey guys, I'm a druid, right?\n\n01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.600\nYeah.\n\n01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:44.600\nAll right.\n\n01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:49.760\nAnd I, I, I want to convene with the wood, do I have like a, like a, like a spell I can\n\n01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:50.760\nuse to kind of.\n\n01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:52.760\nYou're going to touch the wood?\n\n01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:55.800\nThat's what she said again.\n\n01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:56.800\nYeah.\n\n01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:02.680\nI, I walk up to the tree, it was one of the walls and I, and I started just touching\n\n01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.920\nthat wood.\n\n01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:13.200\nYou, you feel the pain of an ancient, the, the, the, the anger and the rage, the violence,\n\n01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:17.560\nthe violence, so much violence, both from and against the tree.\n\n01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:22.040\nOh man, this tree is fucked up.\n\n01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:25.040\nThis whole, this whole thing is fucked up.\n\n01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:30.720\nGuys, we got a violent tree here.\n\n01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:35.240\nI, I can't even ask you anything.\n\n01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:37.240\nWiggle harder.\n\n01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:40.240\nI thought you could communicate there's some sort of weird, like, yeah, you definitely\n\n01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:41.240\ncan.\n\n01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.240\nLike Kirby the love bug.\n\n01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:43.240\nLike Horna.\n\n01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:45.240\nI can mime stuff.\n\n01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:52.080\nI'll just mime like, is, is the tree know anything about the syrup?\n\n01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:56.600\nI asked the tree, do you know about the syrup of the begonias and the tree doesn't communicate\n\n01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:07.000\nas such, but you search the tree's memory banks and you see a cruel infestation, a corruption\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:14.160\nseeping through the surface, purging the wood of goodness and filling it with evil.\n\n01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:19.920\nThat seems like necromancer territory, but I can't say that.\n\n01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:31.600\nOkay, is it dead, the tree, the stuff oozing out of it, oh, it's, it's, it's wrapped with\n\n01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:42.120\ndeath energies.\n\n01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:43.560\nYou cast a spell to control it.\n\n01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:44.560\nOh yeah.\n\n01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:51.560\nIt seems to be an undead sort of sludge made from the souls and bodies of decomposed things\n\n01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:56.120\nsmashed to death by the tree.\n\n01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:57.120\nGood controlling.\n\n01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:59.120\nAll right.\n\n01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:09.480\nIt fails its will save and is dominated by you.\n\n01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:14.840\nI wonder if we can turn the sludge into delicious syrup for us.\n\n01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.520\nThat's what he was about to ask, what the hell is the syrup?\n\n01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:18.520\nSay again?\n\n01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:19.760\nWhere's the syrup?\n\n01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:20.840\nThis is the syrup.\n\n01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:24.040\nThe syrup is dead, people.\n\n01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:25.040\nYeah.\n\n01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.040\nWho said that?\n\n01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.040\nWho said this is the syrup?\n\n01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.360\nThis, this is his intuition.\n\n01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:37.880\nI, I, I pick up on it and I mime, this is the syrup.\n\n01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:43.000\nWe're saying we should feed it to him first.\n\n01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:46.880\nWhen we get it back, if he eats it or consumes it?\n\n01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:47.880\nThere's so much.\n\n01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:52.520\nYeah, to make, to make sure, to make sure it's not poisoned, and if it is, then we only\n\n01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:53.520\nlose you.\n\n01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:59.680\nI go way back with Rogue and we, he saved my life in NAM and so I owe him, so I'll, I'll\n\n01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:05.520\nslurp it to see if it's poisonous or magical cursed or something.\n\n01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.000\nIt's, it's pretty strong.\n\n01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:17.000\nIt seems like you could use some pancakes to cut the flavor or something.\n\n01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:24.280\nI mime, I mime Steve Carell's head on a stack of pancakes from the poster of Dan in Real\n\n01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:32.600\nLife.\n\n01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:38.840\nI take out my bucket of plenty.\n\n01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:46.360\nIt's a magic bucket that holds more than it looks like it should hold.\n\n01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.400\nFrom where do you procure this object?\n\n01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:52.040\nIt's one of my druidic magical implements that I carry.\n\n01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:56.720\nNo, it really leaves the house without a bucket of plenty.\n\n01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:06.960\nI got it from an old shaman named Barrel Lady and I take my bucket, I take my, I take\n\n01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:12.600\nmy bucket of plenty and I swoop it into the, to the mystical goo and gather as much as I\n\n01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:13.600\ncan.\n\n01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:14.600\nAll right.\n\n01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:15.600\nDid you do that?\n\n01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:16.600\nThat's great.\n\n01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:17.600\nYou got a bucket.\n\n01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:18.600\nOh man.\n\n01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:23.440\nBut as you grab the bucket, you feel the impact of wood against wood.\n\n01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.960\nIt's attacking the walls around you.\n\n01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.680\nFight!\n\n01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:35.080\nI don't know what he said because he just kind of jiggled.\n\n01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:38.400\nI don't know.\n\n01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:44.720\nAre we being attacked by wood?\n\n01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:45.720\nOther wood?\n\n01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:46.720\nYou aren't.\n\n01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:50.360\nYou're just feeling this, this, this woody room you're in, this tree-like room you're\n\n01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:51.360\nin.\n\n01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:52.800\nIt's all getting, getting wailed on.\n\n01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:57.480\nLet's take my bucket of plenty full of syrup of begonias and get the fuck out through the\n\n01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:58.960\nhole that we came in through.\n\n01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:01.960\nI fill my five flasks and I too fall asleep.\n\n01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:02.960\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:03.960\nAll right.\n\n01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:04.960\nYeah, we got so much stuff.\n\n01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:05.960\nYou do that.\n\n01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:06.960\nYou land back in the shack.\n\n01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:07.960\nIt's great.\n\n01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:15.160\nOh man, it's not fucked in any way.\n\n01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:22.760\nI call an Uber and say, let's go to Pete's house and eat these motherfucking pancakes.\n\n01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:23.760\nShall I go for it?\n\n01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:24.760\nIt's going to be the best.\n\n01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:27.760\nOh man, you don't get signal on here.\n\n01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:28.760\nNo.\n\n01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:29.760\nIt's bad.\n\n01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.760\nSome serious shit.\n\n01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:36.080\nKettle one, don't you have dark powers that you could maybe like get us a ride home or\n\n01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:38.080\nsomething like that?\n\n01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.880\nYes.\n\n01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:45.960\nYou get a dark powered ride home.\n\n01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:46.960\nAll right.\n\n01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:50.800\nWell, should we end the D&D session there?\n\n01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.520\nTo make sure they get their festival money's worth, I could do a horrible rap.\n\n01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:55.520\nYeah.\n\n01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:56.520\nLet me do it.\n\n01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:03.760\nBut only if Michael is my, like, I want you to be like my Rihanna, like, like...\n\n01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:04.760\nBeatbox for us.\n\n01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:10.920\nLike, I'll rap and then you'll do like, like, you'll do like the hook or something.\n\n01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:11.920\nNo.\n\n01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:17.320\nYeah, that's not going to happen.\n\n01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:21.720\nIt would be a pretty low stakes gig, I feel.\n\n01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:22.720\nPeople will be on your side.\n\n01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:24.400\nBut look, I won't tell you your business.\n\n01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:29.360\nWell, he could say what he would sing and then Christian has to sing it, like he has\n\n01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.360\nto interpret it.\n\n01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:31.360\nI mean...\n\n01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.360\nLook, I don't want to...\n\n01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:40.040\nMichael, you could force Christian to do your bidding or Daniela.\n\n01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:41.720\nI mean, I got to get it in the zone.\n\n01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:44.120\nI don't know about you guys.\n\n01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:46.600\nBut we're close to being hard out here.\n\n01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:47.600\nYeah, yeah, no.\n\n01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:48.600\nWe got to hurry up.\n\n01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:49.600\nYeah.\n\n01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:50.600\nAll right.\n\n01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:57.560\nSo by the time we see each other again, we may be just a part of the New Republic of\n\n01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:02.360\nCalifornia or...\n\n01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:10.280\nAll wearing camouflage and with like soap dispenser helmets and like weird, like, microchip\n\n01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:11.280\nbelts and...\n\n01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:20.880\nWe're going to have the best TV and movies and lots of cheese and almonds and roughly\n\n01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:24.160\n40% of the gross national product as far as I know.\n\n01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:28.120\nI mean, shouldn't we organize something where we just say, am I going to get shot for saying\n\n01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:29.120\nthis?\n\n01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:31.440\nIs there going to be a laser on my chest as I say this?\n\n01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:37.200\nBut don't we pay these motherfuckers every quarter a bunch of money?\n\n01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:41.240\nCan't we just sit on it and go, we know likey what you talked about?\n\n01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:46.880\nLike, isn't that how the United States works?\n\n01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.880\nIs it like money flows from...\n\n01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:51.640\nI think it's also how a civil war starts, but I think it is.\n\n01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:53.120\nYeah, like, yeah.\n\n01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:54.120\nOkay.\n\n01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:55.120\nAll right.\n\n01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:56.120\nI don't...\n\n01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:58.640\nDon't want to be your civil war.\n\n01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:00.520\nWhat's so civil about war?\n\n01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:01.520\nAll right.\n\n01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:07.920\nWait, am I correct remembering that Axl Rose, Guns N' Roses rhymed, I don't want to be your\n\n01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:12.480\ncivil war, I don't want to be your human grocery star.\n\n01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:14.040\nThat's a fucking terrible lyric.\n\n01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:15.680\nWell, let's improve on it.\n\n01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:16.680\nGrocery star?\n\n01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:17.680\nWow.\n\n01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:18.680\nAll right.\n\n01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:19.680\nCome on, give me a beat.\n\n01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:20.680\nWe're going to do it.\n\n01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:21.680\nI'm going to put a beat on a rap.\n\n01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:22.680\nBefore you get beat on.\n\n01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:23.680\nWhere is it?\n\n01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:24.680\nThere we

Empire.\n\n01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:56.040\nWe got the meth.\n\n01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:58.040\nYeah.\n\n01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:03.080\nCalifornia is the place to be if you try to go

turn.\n\n01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:12.000\nThe rap should come from the heart.\n\n01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:19.120\nThat's why rap doesn't typically, you don't see a lot of rappers in inaugurations.\n\n01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:20.120\nRap comes from the streets.\n\n01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:21.120\nIt comes from your feelings.\n\n01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:25.640\nBecause it doesn't, you're not supposed to just be like, you should vote for Jerry Brown.\n\n01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:27.520\nAll right.\n\n01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:28.800\nI fucked your mama.\n\n01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.680\nI fucked her good.\n\n01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:33.960\nI fucked her like she was made of wood.\n\n01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:40.520\nWhat that means is that I respected her as if she was a Douglas fir.\n\n01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:44.480\nThank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.\n\n01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:47.280\nThank you so much.\n\n01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:48.280\nJaniella

yeah.\n\n01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:08.160\nDon't take the shirt off.\n\n01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:20.160\nAlso, let's hear it for the music I played tonight by Titanic Sinclair, one of our favorites.\n\n01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:36.160\nDid you get any of that?\n\n01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:50.800\nIt's a good show.\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[162456]}
