00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
From San Francisco, California, the beautiful Marines Memorial.

00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
It's San Francisco's sketch fest, Harmontown is now in session.

00:22.000 --> 00:38.000
Let's bring the stage Spencer Crittenden. Spencer.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Hello. Hello Spencer. How's it going?

00:42.000 --> 00:54.000
All right, in the mayor of Harmontown, you know him, you like him, Dan Harmon.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
I thought maybe there was no one up there. I was going to get mad and walk out.

00:58.000 --> 01:11.000
I was told the house was full. Thank you so much, San Francisco, for having us.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
No, I'm hooting and hollering for you. I hope you're having a good sketch fest.

01:15.000 --> 01:29.000
Jeff just walked off the job. It's okay.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah, we are here in the Marine Memorial Theater and Hotel.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
I guess there's rooms here. Is anybody staying here at the Marine Memorial?

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
I have. I've stayed here a bunch of times. I was talking to them.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
But while they didn't respond, I tried to jump in there.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
He came in real fast. I don't know if they had a chance.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Because normally you go, if anyone's staying here, there'd be an instant, woo!

01:51.000 --> 02:00.000
Yeah, I guess. But it's a small enough place that the one person that stayed here is probably, there he is.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
Who is here from Al Toloma? See, nobody. Nobody.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
What floor are you on, sir?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh, he won't say.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah, because it's a horrible creepy thing to ask about.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
He's a private man. I use a liar.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah, well, I was trying to figure out just by using Wikipedia.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
I was like, oh, Marine, you get nervous when you get into a veteran area.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
You don't want to offend or do anything.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
You wouldn't want to stand in a room that was sacred to a branch of the government

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
and just talk about your fucking self and how many people were at your inauguration.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
You don't want to...

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
You want to respect...

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
I'm doing exactly what he did.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
If there's like Marines under the stage, like in sarcophagi.

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
I don't know if it's like Skyrim where there's just like soldier ghosts are going to go,

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
like you fucking defiled me, now fight me.

03:04.000 --> 03:12.000
After us, there's going to be an all-womens podcast that's going to get way more people.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Sad.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Apologize. Sad.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
You guys saw the chart.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
My favorite chart was the one I think everybody saw.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
It was just based on the transit numbers.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
It was like the first Obama inauguration and then there was something else.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
And then the second Obama inauguration and then the...

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
What was the Women's March? It was the something else.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
And then the second Obama inauguration.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
It was something else.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
It was something else.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
You ladies ought to be proud of yourselves.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
You were something else out there.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
You bedazzled democracy.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
You went, girl.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I conjugated a little phrase.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
And then there was a visual graphic.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
So there were two Obama faces that were identical going,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
and then there was like a female symbol in the middle of them going,

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
yay, and then there was like a little grumpy Donald.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
And there was a thing between the grumpy Donald which was on the bottom

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
and the bottom most thing above the whatever.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Because you look and you see the grumpy Donald which was on the bottom.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Like how many people rode the rails that day in D.C.?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Whatever, 11 or whatever.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
And then right above it you're squinting.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
You're like, what is that graphic?

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
And it's like your average work day.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
That was my favorite graphic.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
And I don't care if it's a lie.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
I love, yes, fake news.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Just put fake news in a rock and just throw it.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
It's probably not untrue.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
But I don't care anymore.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
You go on Twitter which is the greatest place to be in the world

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
because you're going to get so much done there.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Because it's like, let's just keep sitting on Twitter.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I'm not saying let's get off of Twitter.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm just sarcastically berating myself.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Why am I doing this?

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
You get on Twitter and you're just like, hey, I feel like a piece of shit

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
and I want to fucking blow everything up.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Fuck you.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Everyone go fuck yourself.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
You're all fucking stupid.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Why have you done this to me?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Fuck off.

05:15.000 --> 05:22.000
And then there's people that just go like, better than Hilary.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
And then you fucking find yourself arguing with them.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Well, meanwhile, there's people going like, amen, brother, high five,

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
and you don't respond to them.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
It's like my life has become community.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
Now I'm bad at show running anarchy.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
I should just fucking be thanking people as we go down.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Like, thank you.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Thank you.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Thank you.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
I'm glad that you also feel that this is fucked up.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
But I found tonight, Dustin Marshall, our producer,

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
turned us on to this Twitter account that is at Trump underscore regrets.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
And it feels so bad good.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
It's just retweets everybody that's just saying to Donald Trump like,

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
what the fuck are you doing?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I voted for you.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
And it just makes you just feel good.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
And you shouldn't feel good.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
But it's like, my favorite ones are not the people that are like,

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
what the fuck are you doing?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
You promised you'd throw out the Mexicans.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
And I'm like, OK, that's not.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
They're going to be a return customer.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
They're going to be like, all right, now that's better.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
They're taken care of.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
But I like the people that are like, why are you bitching

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
about the New York Times, you pussy?

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
I voted for you because I'm a man.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
I like that.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
I'm like, yeah, fucking yeah.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Because that picture that you saw in your history book of Mussolini

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
and his friends at the partway through World War II,

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
because Italy didn't make it all the way to the end,

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
even though they literally invented the word fascism,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
even though Hitler kind of nailed it.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Oh, hi, Spencer.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Hey, guys.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Yeah, Hitler was great.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
At fascism.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Hitler was great at fascism.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
He was better than Mussolini.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Also a terrific painter.

07:17.000 --> 07:24.000
There is the classic photo from the end of fascism in Italy.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
It is Mussolini and his various friends, his entourage,

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
his turtle and his Mikey or whatever their names are,

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
drama and e-pants.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
And they're upside down because they've been dragged through

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
the market and they've been hung up like meat.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
And the people standing outside of them going, hey,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
look at this, those aren't liberals.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Those are disgruntled former fascists.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
The liberals are dead.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
They're in prison.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
They've left.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
They were rounded up and shot.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
I mean, fascism just eats through your country like a cancer

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
and then it eats itself because there's nothing left to eat

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
and it does it in record time.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
It's a modern disease.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
It shouldn't be dismissed.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Much like anorexia.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
There's people that dismiss eating disorders

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
because a bad person will go like, oh, I can't find

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
an anorexic in Africa so we should dismiss this.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
No, it's a modern thing that's germane to this particular

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
context.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Fascism is only possible in a modern context,

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
a post-industrial context where it's like people that get

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
poor, that have been promised utopia, they start to get

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
freaked out and disgruntled.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Multiculturalism starts to scare them.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
This Christmas isn't going to be like last Christmas.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
That's the first thing that happens.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
That's basically what it is.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
It's like, I got a BB gun last year and this year I got

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Optimus Prime.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
What the fuck's happening?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
That's the beginning of fascism.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
That's the potting soil.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
You just made me sad about George Michael.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
The very next day.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
I was thinking Optimus Prime is way better than a BB gun.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
That's what I was thinking, yeah.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Optimus Prime was my generation's BB gun.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
I don't know what I said about a BB gun.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
But anyways, people get disgruntled, dissatisfied,

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
and then you can't blame the funny guy with the funny

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
hair that ends up clowning around and distracts everybody.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
It's all of us.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
We're all to blame.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
It just becomes this weird thing.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
It's an infection that sets in.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
What is my point?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
What are we going to do?

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
I don't know what the fuck we're going to do.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Why do you need to hear this from me?

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
You've been thinking about it all day.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
We're all watching it happen.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
We just keep feeling like what are we supposed to do?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Our legs are twitching.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Do I grab a rock?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Do the rock do?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Who would I throw it at?

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Do I wait until there's someone to throw it at?

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
It might be my neighbor.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Are they coming from my housekeeper's family?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Are they coming from my friends?

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
Wait, let's talk about that for a second.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
I'd like to see some papers.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I mean, it's a thing.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Jerry Brown, our beloved governor,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
he makes a speech and he says,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
listen, man, they can't come in here.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
They can't take anybody.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
It's not going to happen.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
And then in the same speech, he's like,

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
plus silver lining, monorail money!

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
He's psyched.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
I don't understand.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
All of us, I think everybody is walking around

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
in weird days because we're kind of like,

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
well, we've never, ever, ever, ever lived in this world.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
We've never lived in a world that feels to us

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
like it's in a history book.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
You just open up your phone and it's just like,

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
oh, all Goodwill's are closed.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Wait, I was about to buy pants

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
and then the head of Goodwill then starts

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
a different account and goes, fuck the police!

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
And he's like, everybody follow the head of Goodwill

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
and then it's gone.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
And then meanwhile, all of you are like,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
oh, I got fired because I followed the Goodwill guy.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I don't know what to do now.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
We're freaking the fuck out.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
We don't know what to do.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
When do you move?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
When do you move and where do you move

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
and how do you move?

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
I do know that the A line,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
I don't think it's my last line,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
I do know that I will die for my housekeeper.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
I will.

11:53.000 --> 12:00.000
I will meet you outside my house.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
I'm sure she won't want to hide at my house, though,

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
because it'll be like this weird conflict of interest thing

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
where I'm like, here, hide in there,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
but also there's...

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
It's not because of my respect for her,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
it's because I'm a baby man that like most Californians

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
like lives at the mercy of a vibrant,

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
you know, like flowing, multicultural fucking,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
like it's arterial flow.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Everybody from every country that ever has any problem

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
that's running from something, hiding from something

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
that hasn't found what they're looking for yet,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
they're supposed to be able to come here,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
we're supposed to be the hotel lobby of the world

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
that was our gimmick, a death to monarchy.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
We hold these truths to be self-evident,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
we barely need to save them,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
but here's a giant fucking contract

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
you can exploit 300 years from now.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
We hold these truths to be self-evident,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I can say whatever the fuck I want,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I can do whatever the fuck I want,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
but except for black people and women.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Yeah, and you can't tweet about Baron Trump.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
Yeah, kids are off limits, kids are off limits,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
kids are off limits, fire the writer,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
fire the writer that joked about the kids

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
because kids are off limits, okay, she's fired.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Can she come work over here?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
You're a piece of shit, you should fucking die,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
you cock-sucking piece of shit.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
Do you want to just follow this SNL writer

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
for the rest of her life,

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
haunting her to make sure she just kills herself?

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
What happened to job creation?

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
Can't she just go work for another shitty person

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
you don't like?

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
Are you afraid of all the people that disagree with you?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Dude, shit, whatever they want,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
that you will be left alone watching Gobert Pyle

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
in your basement?

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
Like, what is this impulse we have?

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
I know what it is, that was a rhetorical question.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I know what it is, and that's the only thing

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
that we have to save us.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Is that all of these fucking people,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
every time you get in a fight with somebody online,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
they always, if they're not a Russian bot

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
or just like a fucking weird greasy troll

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
that's just like, you know, they're shaped like an egg

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
and they're just terrified of women

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
and they're so fucking mad.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
This guy talking to my girlfriend,

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
she posted a picture of her and her mom

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
at the Women's March, it's just like,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
in real life, this thing,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
you come around and you see a group of guys

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
in digital reality standing around your girlfriend

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
going like, yeah, but slut shouldn't abort.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
What the fuck are you people doing?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Get the fuck away from my girlfriend.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
But then you're sexist.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
It's like, are you fucking out of your mind?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
It's a photo of her and her mom.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
What the fuck are you doing?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Why are you using the word slut?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Who the fuck brought that up?

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
What are you, God damn it, this is not a comedy show.

15:04.000 --> 15:13.000
Why are you so fucking mad and who are you mad at?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
You are mad at a fiction.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
You are mad at some propaganda poster.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
You are mad at some racist fucking drawing

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
you saw in a hustler.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Like, you have been told that you are paying for abortions.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
You're paying for welfare.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Oh, you're money.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Oh, your money's going to all these poor people.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Motherfucker, my money's going to everybody.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Mine and Alec Baldwin's and Tina Fey's.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Like, the 1%.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Oh, California pays for fucking everything.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Everything.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
And we're bluer than blue.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
And we're richer than Christ.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Well, that's not a...

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
He was notoriously broke.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
We're richer than creases.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
But he never releases returns.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
We don't know.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
We don't know.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
Jesus Christ needs to release his fucking...

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
His 1090 of Turin.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
That's a lot of miscellaneous income.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Let's face it.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
I mean, how much did he really render under Caesar?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
We don't know.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Yeah.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
If you can turn water into wine,

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
I'm pretty sure you can claim home office space.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Yeah.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
He knew where the Camins were.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
I want to say where was I,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
but I don't want to know where I was.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I want to make...

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
You were slowly descending into madness.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I know.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
It's just...

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Here's the thing.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Here was what I was going to talk about.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
This is this popular thing now that we're all encountering.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
We're all saying, oh, King George is mad.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
He just ate his own shit on TV.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
He just pulled out a doo-doo and said,

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
this isn't a doo-doo.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
It's a candy bar and ate it.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
And we're going like, he's mentally ill.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
We should get him out of the most powerful desk

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
we have available to any of us.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
He's just ate shit.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
He might mistake anything for anything.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
We're the most people.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
What do we do?

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
And you can express that as a person who maybe

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
hated Hillary Clinton, maybe voted,

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
loved Bernie Sanders, maybe you loved Jill Stein.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
Maybe you far as fucking weird fever dream second

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
thought Donald Trump was a good idea,

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
but by and large, you could just be a person

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
just saying, OK, now I think this seems,

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
given the stakes involved with this corporation,

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
I think we ought to examine all of our options

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
and just look at what you've been doing.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
And honestly, I know you don't have to

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
take your hands from behind your back.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
There's no rule that says you have to.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
It's weird that you won't.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
And we'd like to see what's in your hands, Damien.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
We'd like to see what's in your hands.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
Because you seem very proud that there's nothing

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
in your hands.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
And you said you'd show your hands if you won.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
And then you said, I'll show my hands after the audit.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
And then you said, I'll show my hands never.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
And then your fucking weird nutcracker

18:26.000 --> 18:32.000
dressed decepticon went on Meet the Press

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
and said, OK, now he's going to show his hands on Sunday

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
morning after brunch.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
And then you said, no, I'm not.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
And I don't know what the fuck is in your fucking hands.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
You're the fucking president.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
The fuck is in your tax report?

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Sorry, you distracted me.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
The tiny hands thing, I mean, whatever.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
If it gets to him, let's do it.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
But I'm like, if that's a small dick thing,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
then fuck everybody.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
I think it's just fun because he hates it.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Like, whatever he hates, just pile on.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Spencer and I were talking about it earlier.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Is it better?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Like, I don't know about you guys.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
I fantasize that if I met Donald Trump, what would I do?

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Would I fuck with him?

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Would I try to just?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I would tear a mattress tag off of him.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
You're in soaked mattress tag.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
They got those videos, and they're just going to keep him.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Russia's going to make Trump do their bidding

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
because they got the pee-pee videos.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
They're fucking geniuses.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
But who among his followers wouldn't just start

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
saying pee's delicious?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Like, why wouldn't they?

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
When I saw that thing, I was like, no, that fits perfectly.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
The story is that he paid hookers to pee on the Obama's bed.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
I'm like, I'm running my video.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.000
I'm running my very easy-to-run Trump simulator,

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
Trump fan simulator, which is 16 kilobytes.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
And I'm going, fucking, hip hop hooray.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Like, that's what I want in my Trump.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
I want him to pay hookers to pee on the Obama's hotel bed.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
If he's gobbling the pee and going, like, I love pee.

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
Like, maybe, maybe.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Like, maybe it would flip them.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
We're waiting for his fans to flip.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
His fans don't flip.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
His fans are a fucking wine stain.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
Like, they don't turn into an ice cream stain.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
They don't, like, there's no...

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
His fans have committed to such a degree

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
of psychologically criminal fucking treasonous

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
toxicity.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
There's no fucking anything.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
They have committed so long ago to the idea

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
that they are simply sick and tired

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
of being told they're stupid and wrong.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
And so, like, proving them stupid and proving them wrong

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
is like, it's like shining sun on Birdman.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
He was a superhero character in the 70s.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
He got his strength from the sun. I should have picked something else.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
Is there a chance that somebody, like, as a fan of our show,

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
brought their Trump-supporting father or mother here,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
and they're just sitting there really uncomfortably right now?

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
I would show anybody in here that was willing to,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
in the interest of connection and stuff,

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
I would offer you the utmost verbal and psychological

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
and spiritual protection if you were willing to come up here

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
and be a voice for the other.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
I understand absolutely if you don't want to,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
and don't force yourself if you're on the fence

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
because the truth is we're all, you know,

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
like being on the fence doesn't count.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
But if somebody was passionate,

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
okay, sir, so if you want to come up here and...

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I didn't know that was going to happen.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Yeah, also...

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Hello, sir.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
What's your name?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
My name's Zane.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Zane, all right.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Zane, grab a microphone, Zane.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
I...

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
And Zane, for real, like Dan said,

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
like, total respect for coming up there

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
and coming up here and, like,

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
this is a safety zone where we're not going to, you know,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
just take a giant cramp on you.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
Yeah, but also we can't make any promises for the audience,

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
who is a group of uncontrollable people.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
No, shit got mutinous out there pretty quick

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
because there's a rumbling.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Yeah, I'm actually lied,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
but I have a solution.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
Yeah, this is what I thought was the case.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
This is your...

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
You're being rude for not being a Trump supporter.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Yeah, that's what's happening.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Would you call your solution final?

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Because you might still count.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Under the circumstances, I would say no.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
I started a software project to end suicide

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
within our lifetime.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
All right, well, you high-roaded us.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
We can't...

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
I came up here to help inner-city children.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I pretended I was a Trump fan.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Okay, well, tell us about it.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
That's fine.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Okay, so...

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
We have a website called letsandsuicide.com

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
and basically we're going to provide

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
a machine learning algorithm

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
that will monitor your social media output

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
and determine if you're in a depressive or romantic episode.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
And then from there,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
we have a version 1.5.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Easy, easy, steady.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
We have a version 1.5 where

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
a medical health professional will get in touch with you

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
if it thinks that you are...

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
depressive.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Hold up, same.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
So you're saying that you're...

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
This audience has heard elevator pitches

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
for start-ups before.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
I'm not saying it's fair.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I'm just saying this is what I'm realizing.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
This is true.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Yeah, it's non-profit.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
We're incorporating next week.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Well, yeah, I mean, that was kind of the inspiration for it.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
You know how to win them over at these fickle bunch

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
is to tell us what personal investment

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
you have in this.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I have a lot of...

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I have, in personal experience,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
one of my family members committing suicide,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
but I have several friends who have.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
And I think it's a major problem,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
and I think that we have the technology to take care of it.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
We have ten versions.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Can you explain how that works?

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Because I think a lot of people are going,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
wait, so if I...

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
It's only you sign up for...

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Yeah, you sign up.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Right now this is just an idea,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
I just got home from my job

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
at Universal Studios Theme Park.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
The T-Rex's balls needed to be cleaned again.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I want to fucking kill myself.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
And then this app goes,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
boop, boop, boop, boop.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Yeah, there's a big,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
giant monolithic computer system.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
But really, I'm being silly,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
but we need...

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
You have to sign up to this...

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Yes, it's opt-in.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
You opt-in.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
So you're monitoring everybody that says...

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
No, it's only your public social media output,

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
whatever you want to provide the actual...

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
So if you feel like you might be suicidal,

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
you go to this.com

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
and say monitor me and tell me that I'm

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
possibly suicidal?

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Hopefully you would do that before you got to that point.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
It's for people like myself who have mental health issues.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Yeah, I really don't...

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Yeah, obviously the logical part of your brain,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
and I'm not knowing enough

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
about that mind state,

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
except that it does deserve

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
care.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
I don't want to trump over anybody,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
but the obvious kind of

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
internal logic comedic mechanisms

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
go like, okay, so just logically,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
I'm either A,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
happy, therefore,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
not really anticipating a future

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
suicide, and therefore not

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
signing up for this, or I'm B,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
suicidal, and therefore probably also

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
not taking steps to...

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Right, well we'll have an emergency contact

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
system, that's one of the ideas with the app.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
So if you ever need to talk to anybody,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
there'll be a volunteer.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
And so I would say to the asshole

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
me that just said that,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
well, and you confirm

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
if this is right or not, the suicidal

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
ideation, and the states

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
of mind that come with it, for some people

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
are actually...

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
We can dismiss them because we're like,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
well I've never been that sad,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
give me a break, but for some people

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
it's so chronic and so constant

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
that actually some people do have to live

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
like skipping on that pond

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
and that those people can go

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
in a clear state of mind, like this is

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
going to happen again, history's taught me

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
and so I'm putting this padlock

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
on the fridge. Yeah, I myself am

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
bipolar, and bipolar one,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
and I...

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Basically... Thank you,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
you can multiply that applause

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
times two because... Exactly,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
I have two states of mind, I'm actually a

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Gemini, you got

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
whoops from the half of the bipolar

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
people who are currently manic.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Exactly, perfect.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Is that offensive?

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
No, not offensive at all.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
He got the most whoops ever, period.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Let's send suicide.com

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Nice.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Oh, so you need volunteers?

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Well, for the first version of the app,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
we are basically taking pro bono work,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
the first version is 0.1.0

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
which is dedicated to Carrie Fisher,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
mental health advocate,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
space princess.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Well,

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
give us a taste of the suicide statistics

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
just till we understand, because we don't

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
think about this stuff as... Aren't they

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
really leading cause and male death?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Yeah, absolutely.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Like they're up there, right? Yeah, I mean

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Alaska is like huge issues, I don't have the numbers on me,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
I'm like a Trump, so I just come up here

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
completely off the dome.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
No, it's okay, we'd rather you

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
say you don't know, but it's big,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
it's a big deal, it's not like

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
it's not like your pet cause

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
that's like little tiny, little bitty-bitty

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
thing in the face of breast cancer

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
or prostate cancer.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Well, it's funny you mentioned that, because

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
version 10 seeks to end cancer with an

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
arseus. Whoa!

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Geez!

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I jumped like versions 2 through 9,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
but version 10... So this thing is slowly becoming

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
SkyNet? Absolutely.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
It starts by preventing you from

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
killing yourself, then it prevents your cancer,

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
and then the version 4.0

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
is like, why aren't you a computer?

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Yeah, basically.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Like you post on Facebook,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
I had a great day, and the thing is like

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
eep, eep, eep.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
A siren goes off over your head.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Yeah.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I have a question, and

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
I'm not trying to be provocative here.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
You seem like a very sympathetic, empathetic guy.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Like you're doing this...

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Which sounds like a very

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
selfless, very noble thing.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
I'm

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
not trying to be a dick, and I know that...

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
No, please. I need feedback, so...

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Well, I'm just wanting to...

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I have friends that are very smart,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
very emotionally sensitive,

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
intelligent people

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
who believe

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
politically in things that I just don't

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
really quite grasp, because

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
I don't see the empathy in their politics.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
I don't see the

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
empathetic part of it. We become too polarized, and

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
the problem with the U.S. system is that we have

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
two parties, we need a third party to balance out

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
the issue.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
So I also started a new political party.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Well, Trump...

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Yeah, I noticed you didn't get paid for that.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
We're all out of ideas, so...

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Trump has already vowed to end all political parties

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
by 10 years from now.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Oh, shit. We've got to work fast, I guess.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Political parties have been running the country

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
for 300 years with no results. Sad!

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
It's called New Rally.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
You can find us at

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
newrally.us.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
New Rally, you think neutrality, you think

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
new reality. Wait a minute.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
You just made it harder to remember.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Did I?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Wait, why did you guys react that way?

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I was reacting because it's hard to remember.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
It sounds too Orwellian, I think.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I think it goes a little into the...

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Perhaps.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
What's it called? The Newspaper...

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Native force, though. Well, we're all going a little bit

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
better. At the New Rally's

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
flags,

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Latin insignia, which is,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I don't fucking idea.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
All bets are off at this point.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I'd love for everybody that has

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
an idea to let us know.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
I don't fucking know what

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
to do.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
It's like

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
a disaster movie, like a

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
cheap sci-fi one with an 80s

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
pop star as the star.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
The reason

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
why there's not as much dramatic shit

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
happening outside your window is just because

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
I should it, that would cost too much.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
It's like most of the scenes are just happening

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
on a two-walled set with Debbie Gibson

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
saying, so they're mosquitoes, but they're

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
men?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
And

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
it's all happening on Twitter, basically, for me

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
because it's the only thing I have time to go to.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
It's like I said to a congressman today,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
not even my own, just some random one

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
that had tweeted something. I was just like...

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Because he said something provocative and hyperbolic

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
and bravado-filled

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
and I...

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
about how the Republicans have blood

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
on their hands and they're... we're accountable

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
for all this thing and I was just like, not being a dick

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
but just going like...

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
We...

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Most of us voted for you guys

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
and nothing happened.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
So, like, I just...

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
I swear to God, I'm only asking, like, what do we do?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
And he didn't answer and then someone else

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
did. It's like, what you do is you visit your representative

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
and then you take a sponge

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
and you put it on your head and you roller skate down the street

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
and you...

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
And it's not that those things

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
aren't the solution, it's just that

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
they don't sound like the solution.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
It...

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
You compare that to a 4chan

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
thread where people just go,

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
take this picture of a frog

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
fucking the Statue of Liberty

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
and copy and paste it

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
and...

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
and just fuck everything

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
and, like, that we know

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
how to do because we love to be angry

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
and we love to, like, shake pillars

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
we love to, like, show up

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
for stuff, we love to be

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
defiant, we love to express ourselves

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
like, how do we...

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
What do we do?

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I don't expect you to know.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
I might, I mean, I don't know.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Basically, we're trying to

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
increase protests, protests outside

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
of our U.S. capital.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
It's entirely volunteer.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Whoever wants to sign up can sign up.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
That's, like, our first step.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Is it because if we...

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Continue. Why are you laughing?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I'm just having a good time.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Is it...

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Is it because if we...

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
if we increase protests, is it because...

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
is it...

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
This won't leave this room.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
This isn't being recorded.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Can you guys keep a secret? You guys are cool?

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Is it because the more we do that,

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
the more we increase the likelihood

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
of a Kent State Massacre and can actually

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
start getting things done?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Are we nothing more than

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
roles commanding from behind

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
going like everybody get in the streets

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
and

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
to express yourself

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
knowing that

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Hitler is in the White House

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
and that, therefore,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
something's going to happen?

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Are we...

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
We're going to find out one way

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
or another.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
All right.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
That's it for Zane, everybody. Zane.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Thank you for coming up, brother.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
I think...

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Thank you, Zane.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
I think his curating

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
evens out

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
he lied to get up here

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
to prevent suicide

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
with a

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
specious system

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
that will also include a third party

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
that will consist of waiting to be killed.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
But I think all in all

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
a good guy.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Yeah.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
I don't think we should...

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Yeah, if we hate him

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
our priorities are fucked

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
because

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
there's a lot more to hate right now.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Yeah, I don't know what to do, man.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I'm on my elliptical every day

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
and when you see me forget

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
to...

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Thanks, guys.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
I was going to say, you are looking hard as a rock.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Our side's not going to win

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
because that's where our high bar of heroism is.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I...

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
I'm going to forgo the Hagen-Baz

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
tomorrow. Yes, Patrick Henry.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Yes!

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
I...

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I agree.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Absolutely.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
I think I'm an absolute fucking heroic man

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
for being on that elliptical.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
It certainly feels like it.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
When...

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Thank you, you dad.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
When you see me

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
in that last song

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
when it's only the good day

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
where I was at the young world...

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
I'm thinking about...

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
I'm...

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
about it being over the exercise but

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
I'm also just

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
thinking like...

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
I'm going to elliptical

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
democracy.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
I'm going to...

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
What am I going to do with these skills?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
I'm going to have more muscle

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
tissue and more

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
less heart disease, actually.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
What a great metaphor.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
You feel like you're doing something but you're going nowhere.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
It's fantastic.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Jeff,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
tell me this.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Spencer, if you...

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
What do you really project?

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Because a big part of the problem

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
here is just confusion.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
We've never been... We don't know what's going on.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
We don't know what to expect. We just keep going.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Holy shit, they can't do that.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
It's crazy.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
What do we actually...

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Where do you...

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Whether you want to project to the end of your life

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
because that's the only thing I can project to

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
and I'll go first.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Or if you...

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Or if you want to project like

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
three years, five years, whatever

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
but all I know right now

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
is that I'm going to fucking die

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
and I'm going to die in the street.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
They can't kill all of us.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
What?

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
They could.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
They can kill all of us.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
They can.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
But it will be very difficult

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
and they will spend a lot

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
of time cleaning up afterwards

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
and what they can't do

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
basically is

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
throw us all in prison.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
And it's like

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
weirder to start with the killing.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Even Hitler didn't.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
It's like...

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Exactly.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
It's like well it's going to come

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
to this thing where it's just like

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
this game of red rover.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
That's all...

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Democracy comes down to.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
It doesn't matter who has drones and who has tear gas

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
and who has anything.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
All the sheep have to decide

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
it's better to trample than to

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
bleed.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
There is no bleeding. It won't work.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Bleeding is for farmers.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Farmers cut the power off

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
to the fences. I came up with that on Twitter today

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
when I was drunk on the plane.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
And I'm sure

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
if Orwell were in the wings he'd be like

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
I came up with that. You just didn't read my book

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
and...

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
But for all I know

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
he'd be like whoa I should have gone with that.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
But I feel like it's like

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
we are the majority

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
and we are soft

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
and we by and large don't pride ourselves

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
on our ability to hunt and kill.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
And yet for some strange reason

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
we don't pride ourselves on being sheep.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
For some strange reason politically

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
to call someone a sheep is

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
like it's to say

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
oh you're a piece of shit.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
For some reason we all agree with that.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Like oh

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
no I'm not a sheep. I'm a

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
totally autonomous fucking thing.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
I just happen to live in a

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
300 million member honeycomb

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
and fill out

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
forms every time I work

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
and all this stuff and receive

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
all the comforts and wipe my ass with

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
two-ply cottonel that was spun

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
by a robot somewhere in Singapore.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Like I'm not a sheep

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
oh don't offend me.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
But it's like maybe that's...

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Everyone go to let'sendsuicide.com

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
and help Dan Harmon.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
There is a vast minority

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
of carnivorous assholes

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
who pride themselves on

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
sinking their blood encrusted teeth into our

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
throats and watching the rest

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
of us scatter and I just

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
sometimes you see videos or read

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
and things or hear in Pink Floyd songs

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
about the concept

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
of soft herd animals

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
just having a fucking

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
enough and becoming a scourge

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
and just going

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
like guess what we're the new

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
fence you're in the middle of a

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
sheep pen that you thought you compromised

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
we are the fence

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
you are feeding in the midst of us

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
eating that throat and it will be your

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
last you are going to be suffocated

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
with delicious wool

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
and trampled with

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
vegan hooves

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
What was my point?

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Well, for that

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
because I'm not a politician

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
and I don't know how this shit works

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
and I've got the congressman's

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
numbers on my phone and my girlfriend

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
we're gonna fucking do this shit

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
we're gonna go to Kamala

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
what's your name's house every day and whatever the fuck

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Harris

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Her name's Harris

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I didn't mean what's your name because she's not a human

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
I just couldn't remember her name

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
and you could have said Harris more gently

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
like Harris

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
I'm sure she's a wonderful person

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
my girlfriend is like

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
down for that

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
and I

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
all I see in my crystal ball

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
is me

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
outside my home in Las Vegas

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
holding a two by four

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
clumsily

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
like with like

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
one of my dogs blood smeared across it

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
because somebody fucked with it

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
and like that's how it started

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
like and I

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
and my you know

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
friends and family and anybody that wants

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
protection is inside and I'm just

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
out there and it's just a big

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
heavy piece of wood and I'm just

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
going

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
and and and just screaming

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
at them

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I'll wrap it in barbed wire that was

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
what was thought about that image

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
you know

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
I'm so glad I came to San Francisco tonight

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
you know I'm going back

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
home knowing how to make the system

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
work you also got to go

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
you should invest in some

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
like football shoulder pads and put like spikes

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
on them

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I think you guys are focused on the wrong

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
part of this plan

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
but I'm just saying if you want to

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
I will do those things I promise

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I will there sound like good ideas

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
I'm just mean that is

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
I'm answering my own question first and saying

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
that is where I see this ending I don't

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
see any other way

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
I don't I don't see

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
if you can't say

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
if

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
if NBC and

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
I can't say

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
okay

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
she made a mistake

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
in her private fucking life on her

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Twitter account like like like but here's

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
the thing about comedy which is what

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
we do and which is what we've been

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
doing throughout many decades

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
and many presidents and all

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
your little foopy doops of all your

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
little cultural things we sell comedy

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
comedy is an ugly business

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
it's a lot like coal or

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
diamonds it causes bad

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
it to happen it's covered in blood

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
but it's worth money

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
and

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
we don't have to be political

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
to hold the line at comedy

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
to hold the line at the first

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
amendment and say I don't care

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
who enters that shitty fucking

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
gaudy neo-classist fucking house

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
we will be over

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
here at Rockefeller center

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
indulging in our privilege as

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
an institutional fucking variety

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
show that has defined comedy

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
for 50 fucking years

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
that is fucking crazy

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
when that line falls I don't know

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
when the last time it has except

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
like firing norm for joking about OJ

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
but like

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
like like if you can't just say

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
don't fucking like like

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
she was suspended she apologized

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
cool it or watch

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
a different show I have a billion

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
dollars

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
something scary is happening

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
why did I bring that up

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
things are so weird in this world

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
things are so topsy-turvy that you just stood up

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
for NBC

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
no I

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
no I didn't

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I thought you were saying that they were the good guys

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
no NBC created Donald Trump

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
as it turns out for the first time

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
in my life I feel great

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
about being fired

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
that was Sony whatever none of that

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
matters I'm talking about

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
the corporations aren't going to be

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
here for us like this is beyond

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
this is like some people my age

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
might remember like Al Gore and dangling

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Chad's and nation in crisis

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
most of us remember Obama

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
getting inaugurated and like a bunch of

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
those guys are going like oh he's a secret

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Muslim and his head

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
on a plate this is nothing's ever happened

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
this is animal farm this is Orwellian

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
like this is fucking different

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
man there's like national park

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
services like

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
just going rogue and going like

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
the earth is getting warmer

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
and like

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
everything is weird it's like

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
okay so where do you see it going

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
so we have a

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
guest who's been waiting for a while

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
backstage I think it's right

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
on time to bring our guests out well if it's

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
right on time then we can we be two minutes

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
well it's not right on time it's the thing it's

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
later than that it's four it's

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
it is it's one minute shy

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
I said an alarm before we came on stage

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
and there's tell us Spencer how

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
you see this playing out you have 45 seconds

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
well it's like afraid to tell us because

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
you're gonna go fucking fuck you

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
the Republicans are gonna

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
have to face a crisis they're

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
gonna you know they're already starting to think

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
about it they're gonna say are we gonna get

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
in line or are we not and no matter

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
what happens no matter what they decide

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
that's gonna lead to something really bad

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
like the equivalent of burning down

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
the Reichstag or whatever like that I think

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
that's absolutely gonna happen

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
and how it plays out is gonna

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
determine whether or not we devolve into

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
you know civil war whether or not we pick up

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
the pieces and keep moving forward but

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
I think that's something crazy like that is

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
absolutely gonna happen but like how it

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
turns out I think it's a bad sign that

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Trump just recently said that he's gonna build

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
a Reichstag all

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
made all made out of wood

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
like a very flammable it's gonna be so wooden

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
but okay well can I ask

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
where do you see yourself in that picture

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
you know I'm

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
making harm a quest

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
even

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
while I'm with the 2x4

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
well that's that that was insulting man

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
you think you're gonna be out there with a 2x4

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
I'm gonna have sandbags fucking

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
everywhere turrets it'll be great

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
he's gonna be giving classes at the local

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
you think that I'm not gonna take it

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
like charge of apocalyptic

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
scenarios

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
this is all we're asking it's all

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
we want to hear yeah man

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Spencer can you can you stand up and show us

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
physically how you would fight off an attack by

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
a bunch of Republican senators who

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
are trying to close down the the EPA

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
so you lay down with a towel

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
over your head

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
and you put a bunch of Cheetos out

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
all right well okay now

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Jeff where do you

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
see yourself in the apocalypse what's gonna happen

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
um I got the 2x4

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Spencer apparently has

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
sandbags in a turret we'll have I'll get

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
us guns before then I promise

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
I think it might

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
actually get to the point of physical

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
revolts I think like not like

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
let's let's let's

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
storm the Bastille and shit like that but I think

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
we are gonna have to

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
I think he's gonna start declaring Marsha launch it

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
like he's like he's doing in various cities

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
where he wants to I think it actually

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
the women's march is one of the most inspiring things

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
I've ever ever seen and I got to be a part of the LA one

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
based on the results of that guy

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
it was it was awesome

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
the LAPD didn't do

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
anything they just stood there and smiled

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
because everybody was being fucking cool and it was

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
a million people and we couldn't fucking go

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
anywhere because like why aren't we marching

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
for a different hour and a half and we were supposed to

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
go to City Hall we're in Pershing Square

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
and like what the fuck

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
that was the best part in all these cities

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
when people had to come out and go

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
thank you for coming

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
I know you showed up for a march there's so many

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
of you it's a rally you can't march

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
you're already where you were marching

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
but I was like

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
like the worst you saw

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
the worst thing you saw is like

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
like people were bumping in like I have like

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
big feet tall guy killed them and everybody's

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
like you know I'm not that claustrophobic

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
but everybody was so kind

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
and so cool and there were little girls

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
on their mothers or fathers shoulders

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
and like and

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
it was fucking groovy it was really

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
really really really good and you've never seen that many people

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
get along and the next morning

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
totally clean everybody fucking cleaned

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
it up somebody pointed out in the comment because everybody

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
has to comment on when you say that was the best

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
somebody has to

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
inadvertently or inadvertently

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
diminish it and I was like yeah

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
because it was all white people

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
I was like no because it was fucking women

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
man like that's why it was cool

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
oh you mean that guy was going like

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
like chalk one up for the white race

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
no no no he was saying

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
he or she I'm assuming

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
he was like saying like yeah

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
yes if it was 750,000 black

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
men in the streets of Los Angeles

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
would there have been the National Guard out there probably

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
yes and it would it might have

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
oh yeah that's why there wasn't like head to knock around yeah sure sure

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
but it made me

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
like yeah it's hard to know it's like what is your

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
instinct when you are saying that stuff

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
I'm dealing with a lot of that because I feel like that's

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
a kindred spirit it's like well are you kind of like

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
are you kind of spectroming here

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
is this like sort of like

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
like people say like oh

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
unfortunately this won't do anything

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
because here's a photo of all these people protesting

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Hitler and then they'll look what happened

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
it's like this instinct that

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
people that are on our side

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
have to

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
equivocate because they want to feel safe

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
somebody one that really bummed me out is

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I said like they explained

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
MVP awards to the people that cleaned up like

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
perfectly like downtown L.A. was spick and span

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
the next morning and to the LAPD

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
which is not my favorite organization

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
in history because

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
they've been fucking bad at times

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
they were groovy and didn't have

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
a giant police presence and there was

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
no arrest made I don't think in DC either right

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
there's your alarm

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
that's my alarm for my guess

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
somebody said

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
it's like some woman on my

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
I think commented like oh

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
it's nice to see that protests can be

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
peaceful too like

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
protests are fucking peaceful

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
riots are fucking violent like

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
the idea that we live in a world where

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
like protesting might be bad

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
just by definition is really

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
really really really fucked up

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
my favorite comment on the

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
during the women's watch I was sitting

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
at LAX and the real

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
triumphant that was like I was sitting

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
at an international terminal and everyone

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
that was looking at the screen you don't

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
know who they voted for but everyone

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
was going holy shit

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
that's the reaction we have to get

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
every time people going Jesus

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
and none more so than

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Trump he fucking lost

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
fucking cool like like human

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
flesh scraping

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
building

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
sides because they're just

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
poured into the street

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
I guess we must

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
fuck that guy

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
fuck that guy

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I'm gonna fuck him

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
I just

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
I just want to share my

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
cause I have like I want to be thinking

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
about there's like one tweet

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
that somebody was like all the statistics

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
as it was like popping like popcorn

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
like all these journalists going holy shit

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
there's 150,000 there's 200,000

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
you know everyone's like tweeting these things

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
and there was this woman who

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
she was doing it to everybody

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
but like

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
she was responding and saying

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
I just wish

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
the aborted women could march too

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
and then the funniest guy's response

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
was that's someone you don't trust

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
with a genie

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
that's just

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
the

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
the funny

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
that's how we have to win

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
we have to be funnier than them

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
if we can't be funnier we have to be smarter

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
if we can't be smarter we have to be cooler

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
if we can't be any of those things we just have to be honest

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
we just have to say I want to do whatever the fuck I want to do

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
how's that sound

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
I have an English friend

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
she's like a

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
I won't like drop her name

for your charity friends

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
for benefits

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
sure so we when we

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
went to outside lands we were also promoting

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
for an event that we did centered around

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
a cartoon show

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
and on Nickelodeon called avatar

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
be on the podcast didn't go out

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
we had over 300 people there

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
and so yeah it was

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
it was great I mean the venue

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
was great and just everything

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
was amazing and actually

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
before I get started with anything Michael

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
wanted me to let you know that he heard you say

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
F that guy and he was wondering

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
when and where

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
room 402

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
at the memorial marines hotel

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
but in all seriousness we really just

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
we're very thankful for you letting us be

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
on here for the third time

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000

William Conway is a 2020 bid

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
for president of the United States

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
but yeah we really just

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
wanted to show that as a token

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
of our appreciation for everything that you've done for us

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
really thank you

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
you can buy the shirts on

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
friendsforbenefits.org

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
the shirts are on the website

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000

next week online

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
on our website friendsforbenefits.org

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
and I noticed that you have a kettle one

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
vodka here one classy

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
we actually have a barrel girl

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
she um so as you see on the

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
shirt we have a barrel girl

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
we're working on getting a barrel guy maybe someday in the future

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
but it's

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
I'm not a historian but the barrel represents

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
sometime in the early 20th century

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
where people were just so poor

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
that the only thing that they could

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
afford was a barrel

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
and we just kind of made fun with it

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
and we use that as kind of like

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
our mascot for our friends for benefits

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
team and we actually

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
brought our barrel girl here today

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
and she's here to present a gift

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
for you all right

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
thank you

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
thank you barrel girl

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
hello thank you

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
thank you

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
this is daniella

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
she's our barrel girl that you see at every event

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
she

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
needs a better barrel yes

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
she is just fantastic

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
grab a mic

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
barrel girl

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
is it better to be objectified

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
by a charitable

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
foundation

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
than by private

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
private sector

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
considering I've been objectified

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
in ways that were not so charitable

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
I think this is a step up

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
and also I'm a graduate student

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
so I kind of do anything

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
nothing new

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
you've been wearing a veritable barrel

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
for at least a week

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
she has a degree in Koopery

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
all right

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
fantastic so

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
she might have written staves

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
is that the business out of the way

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
I want to make sure

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
friends for benefits

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
friends for benefits

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
bring the car around

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
we organize

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
sick of this bullshit

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
we organize events for

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
other non-profits

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
and we also raise money

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
mostly all of our events

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
are here in San Francisco

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
in the city

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
we're going to need

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
this is where it gets rough

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
we're in the midst of a federal

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
funding blackout

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
does it

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
this is more than you need on your shoulders

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Michael you don't need to answer this

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
so

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
if we take up the slack

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
because let me start from one position

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
you personally if you don't mind

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
answering

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
if I'm prying too much you can say

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
how much of your

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
care is

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
federal

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
something like half

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
and the other half is

58:21.000 --> 58:27.000
through your barrel girls service

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
through the state of California

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
so

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
are there early

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
are you part of communities that are

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
he said

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
oh you're gonna

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
he is

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
oh he said Trump is going to

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
excuse my language fuck

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
him over

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
we could guess that easily

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
I don't even know

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
I might as well just say he's going to kill

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Big Bird I'm going to be right

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
hold on a second let's wait

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
and give him a chance

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Trump might come out and go

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
I want to build a wall

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
and put Mexicans in boxcars

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
and invade Chicago

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
but I got a soft spot

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
for Michael Christian

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
he's not going to do that

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
he's going to fuck everybody

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
he's already made fun

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
of disabled people

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
he already has

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
okay so

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
not to get too distracted

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
but you realize that there's like

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
they have a whole thing where they're like

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
he wasn't actually making fun of that disabled

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
reporter

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I watched the video

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
and their justification for it

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
is that sometimes he goes like this

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
and I'm not naked in a barrel in front

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
of an audience

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
at a certain point

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
you're allowed to say

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
I'm sorry I'm a human being

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
I'm the thing that measures

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
when you're making fun of somebody

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
I saw it

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
we all saw it

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
I don't know what I'm trying to do to get a medal

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I just was curious

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
it would just have been weird if you had said

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
well actually

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
that reporter is kind of a fuckwad

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
and he always goes like this when he talks

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
but

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
that blows my mind

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
the thing that blows my mind about it of course

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
is that underneath

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
that backpedal

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
is their acknowledgement

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
that it would be bad if he did that

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
like

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
so doesn't that mean that

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
this should all just stop

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
if they know that that's bad

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
it's a rhetorical

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
question but it's a

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
he leaned in so I didn't know

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
well I have an answer for that

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I mean every day we are going out to

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
events

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
and we come around the city and

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
no matter what there's always going to be people staring

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
there's always going to be people who don't

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
understand but when you have

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
a big mask on

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
it looks awesome

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
but when you have somebody who's put in such a leadership role

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
who represents the United States

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
and is saying stuff like that

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
it's just

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
it gives you license to stare or not stare

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
to me it seems like the tyranny is actually

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
of the not staring

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
that's what I cop to

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
is when I

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
sense that there's a differently abled person in the room

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
because I have no idea

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
am I allowed to shake their hand

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
you can't

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
you can't

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
you can also say

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
you can also say disabled

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
but when it comes to shaking hands

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
can I say differently abled

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
it's just eight years of PC fucking Naziism

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
sorry

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
let's get real

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
but it's the

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
well whatever I'm babbling it doesn't matter

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
but it's just like

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I think the idea is that

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
it's 9-11

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I love you San Francisco

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
when they comb for this

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
podcast they're gonna

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
they're not gonna have difficulty

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
what Trump said there was a bunch of

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Syrian refugees

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
cheering 9-11 when it happens

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
it's like no that's every Sunday

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
when they got like

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
when he makes that case

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
when Bannon said

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
the media is the opposition party

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
it's like well

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I think

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
we're going to prison

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
we're actually going to be shipped away

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
and terrible things are going to happen

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I'd rather die

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I don't want to go to prison

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I want to die

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I want to be like Steve McQueen and Papillon

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
and fucking be super badass

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I want to be in a time life photo

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
you know like fucking like

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
wheeling Michael Christian down the street

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
with fucking tear gas canisters behind us

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
and then just back of my head

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
is getting blown off

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
but I managed to wheel Michael to the fucking

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
like a van

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
and then Michael's got fucking C4 all over him

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
he just rings the bell

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
and fucking

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
breaks bad

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
you

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I don't want to suck you into this

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
you may have voted Republican

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
you don't need to

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
you don't need to

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
you don't need to be out in the streets with me

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
before we go any further

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I want to go ahead and excuse the barely girl

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
so that she can get changed

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I love that we have a woman on stage

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
she has to wear a barrel

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
she has to wear an old timey barrel around her

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
I think that's the first time people have cheered for me

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
about to put clothes on

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
what was barrel girl's name

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Daniella

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
she's a human being barrel girl

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
I thought maybe the barrel

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I was like well she could just pee

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
right anytime she wants

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
like she's got a million peas before it becomes a problem

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
but

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
but then I noticed there's pants underneath

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
she's not a real barrel

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
that logic doesn't hold up

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
how could her legs work

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
in a closed system

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
coming at the bottom of a barrel

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
like gaskets

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
it's kind of funny that tradition of dressing women

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
is things like a pack of cigarettes

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
or a corn cob or something

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
but it's just like I always thought

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
because of my particular fetishes

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
I was like well you know they're wearing tights

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
like that's all it is

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
like of course

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
corn looks good now

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
if you want to prove

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
corn is sexual

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
when did you see a corn cob inside

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
you actually saw

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
a woman dressed as corn inside

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I've seen a woman dressed as everything

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I'm 44

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I've seen

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
did you guys know

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
if we talked about this

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I'm not judging

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
if you're into this at all

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
you sadly sent me a link

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
to this

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I feel like we talked about this

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
speaking of sending links

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Steve's just been sending us random news links

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
during the show

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
just like Samurai's killed themselves

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
with sepaku

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
here's how they did it

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
it's not an attack on Steve

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
it's great

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
why are your phones on during the show

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
full in on time

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I wish I could

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
refer you to a link

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
there's

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
fart fetish

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
attractive women

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
farting

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
and there's a video

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I was looking for tights

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
and then that went to yoga pants

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
and then there was a video in the sidebar

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
on my hub

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
that said

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
hot yoga girl farts

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
and I was like farts is that a typo

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
and then I clicked on it and she was doing yoga

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
and she was farting and I was like wait a minute

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
and then the related video

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I was like holy shit

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
there goes my Saturday

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
and one of them

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
was amazing

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
this girl

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
you fall in love with her

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
she's farting all over you

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
she's into farting

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
but then she's also

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
kink shamed

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I'm not kink shaming

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
you're kink shaming me

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I'm kink shaming you

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
you're a

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
you're a yell out

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
outerist

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
didn't I just give you a t-shirt

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I just gave her a t-shirt

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
you have yell outophilia

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
okay

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
well

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
are you from Brisbane

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
be right with you Michael

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
this

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
this young lady

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
one of her videos was

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
she's dressed as Harley Quinn

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
and I mean she's really dressed as Harley Quinn

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
like she's committed to the costume

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
which one the movie or the original

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
not Suicide Squad

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
like the way you would

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
play Harley Quinn costume

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
with leather

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
kind of like skin tight leather

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
but she's doing the voice

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
and she's not

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
she didn't look up Harley Quinn on Wikipedia

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
she's so fucking into the mythology

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
she's like hey Mr. B

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
oh boy

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I could fill a stadium

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
with what I got inside of me

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
it's amazing

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
like she's talking to you

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
and your Batman

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
and she has you tied up

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
and she's explaining how she's going to fart

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
she's like I had some sauerkraut

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Mr. J

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
couldn't handle it either

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
and then she just

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
it's farting

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
you will want to marry this woman

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
because of just

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
her soul like it doesn't matter

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
what you're into

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
you're a professional fart lady

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
literally half of the people in this room

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
are in a relationship with somebody

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
whose particulars aren't necessarily

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
their jam but make them so

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
happy because they meet them halfway

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
and it's fun

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
now you like it

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
because you're here with someone

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
that's meeting you way more than halfway

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
now you're

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
she's like yeah

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I love shitting on Natalie in a hot tub

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
that was the lamest riff of what a pink could be

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
shitting on Natalie in a hot tub

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
that's the name of the episode

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
alright hi Michael how are you

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
fantastic

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
he's good

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I love the eyebrows

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
your eyebrows whenever

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I speak to you

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
is it at this point

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
are you indicating

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
what are you doing

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
when you're shooting your eyebrows up and down

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
he can't really tilt his head

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
welcome back

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
he can't tilt his head

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
and so I've been working for Michael

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
for two years now and I've figured out

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
that if it's like

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I can't even move my eyebrows like he can

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
but when he does it multiple times

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
it's a I'm good or it's a yes

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
it's like a thumbs up

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
it speaks like Morse code through his eyebrows

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
because your condition has divested you

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
of the 85 ways that we all have

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
of letting somebody know that you're

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
responding like matching an emotional bit

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
of any kind

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
going like yeah I'm listening

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
like we go uh huh

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
we fuck with our phone

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
because we can like

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
and you're like

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
you have to like

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
but it's also

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
you're lucky because

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
that's adorable

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
going like that is

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
also a way of saying like I'm into you

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
that's what it means

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
and I think what everybody wants to hear

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I always feel like when he does it to me

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
he's coming on to me

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
the first time I met him and then he told me

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I'm going to have my eyebrows

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
and then started wiggling

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
wiggling his eyebrows

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I was um

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
when he's explaining the measurements

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
of the barrel costume and in between

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
every way he's like

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
it's like identical to Bob Gucci

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
you look like a 24-24-24

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
all right

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
so I don't know

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
like uh Michael

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
what would you think about hanging out

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
and like playing a little ad hoc

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
with a big D&D adventure

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
with us

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
we're bringing it back

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
bringing the shit back

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
what if he was like

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
what if he went like

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
and then Christian went like

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
and he's like fuck off

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
and then you just like wheeled out

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
peace

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
all right well cool so Christian

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
you'll stay out and help like Michael

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
play D&D with us

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
we don't have character sheets

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
the first order of business

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
is we got to pick characters

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
we got to figure out who we want to be

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Spencer are you down with this?

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
no

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I can leave

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
it's fine you guys can handle it

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
we're not starting a new campaign

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
necessarily we're just doing kind of

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
one-off

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
it'll be great

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Spencer do you want to assign us

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
characters?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
come up with them

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
someone pitch me something

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
it'll be great

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I always like being like

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
well Michael I'll give you your first choice

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
like in the kind of archetypes

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
you want to be like a healer

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
a fighter or whatever

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
necromancer

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
race do you know your race?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
okay

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
human

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
necro

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
human necromancer

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
what's your name Michael?

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
uh

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
he has no idea

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
you can think about it

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
we'll get there

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
ruminate on your character's name for a moment

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Dan?

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Michael do you get drunk? do you want to drink?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
yeah

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
do you need a straw to get

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
shit-faced?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
actually

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
everything it takes is through a g-tube

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I would need to put my hands down

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
in order to do that

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
wait you have to put your hands down?

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I mean I'd have to put the microphone down

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
I'm sorry

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
oh the g-tube

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
you have to

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
you help him drink

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
okay

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
well you take my mic stand

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
I'll hold the mic you do the g-tube

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
that'll be great

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
but if you're going to give me one second

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I gotta go grab his bag

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
we have to make up our characters

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Danielle would you like a cocktail?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
are you seriously asking?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
in the meantime would you like a vodka?

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
yes

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
wouldn't you after being in a barrel?

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
okay now that Christian's gone

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
like fucking like let's

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
what

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
how much of the day do you spend with him?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
uh six hours a day

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
uh is he

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
that's not that long six hours

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
so what time does he show up?

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
typically around five

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
five a.m.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
p.m.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
oh shit

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
alright fine

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
you have a microphone on

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I'm not that far behind

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
he can hear like

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
my new voices for a living

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I know

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
he hears everything

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
so we got a human necromancer

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
this is mine god damn it

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
what's easiest

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
do you want me to fill this mixing cup

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
with ice and vodka?

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
do you want it cold?

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
just room temperature is that cool?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
is anybody out there a big D&D

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000

Daniella is a big D&D fan

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
what Michael is going to be

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000

Jesus

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
a kinder or a wender

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I don't know what a wender is

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I'm going to be an elf secretary

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
of education

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I'm also a monk

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
I'm an elf monk secretary

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
of education

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
unless I get something better

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
from these people over here

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
wait so right now you're plugging

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
vodka in one of Michael's tubes

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
what's going on here

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
we didn't know about this

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
it doesn't go in his mouth it goes into your matrix

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
umbilical point

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
the best part is he doesn't

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
taste it that's also the worst part

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
that's crazy

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
I'm pretty amazing

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
can I throw some Molly in there

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
wait so do you

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
just get this guy fucked up

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I want to get a picture of this process

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
is that okay is that invading your privacy

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
are you okay with me taking a picture of it

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I'll show it you have

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
you have kill rights on Instagram

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I just it's like we don't

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
we don't get to spend this kind of time together

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I don't think privacy is much of a concern

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
well yeah but this is maybe

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I just don't want to be an asshole on an accident

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
okay

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
but isn't that so is that like

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
what do they call it

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
butt chugging

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
like where it's like

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
you've done this before right

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
you know your limit

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
it's going into your gut

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
right into your stomach

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
okay but that's

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
basically the same as drinking it

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
it's not the same as putting it like a tampon

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
soaked with vodka in your butt

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
it takes less time to digest

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
it hits you faster

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
he's so fucked up right now

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I've never seen you like this Michael

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
why can't you drink it Michael

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
because you're using your mouth

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
to speak and

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
the disease that he has makes it so that the muscles

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
and his throat

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
don't work anymore so like like

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
swallowing doesn't work he can't swallow it all

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
anymore do you eat through the g-tube too

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
correct you don't you don't get to eat

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
solid food anymore at all

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
and you were this is congenital right

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
you haven't eaten solid food

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
ten years

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
well it's it's it's been shitty

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
lately

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
yes they just

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
they're they approved it

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
they approved this new

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
what it's called spin raza

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
and so

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
yeah it's 125,000

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
dollars and I mean

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
sorry

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
yes for each shot

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
and you need six shots

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
it's basically like donating bone

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
bone marrow is what the shot is like too

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
what the way I missed the top of that though

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
what is that

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
that might actually restore you

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
to eating solid food

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
okay

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
but you have to be a senator in order to

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
and then you'd be a hypocrite

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
because you'd be also simultaneously

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
approving of if it's used

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
but you'd be like smuggling it in the

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
back door

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
like an X-men the guy

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
the jellyfish man

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
all right so

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
all right well I'll be a healer

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
because I feel like nobody ever

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
wants to be a healer so

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
like

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
and I feel like tonight I have been a healer

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I've also been intuitive and I know

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
forced applause when I hear it

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
you could tell I wanted that

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
it was worse than getting it

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
organically or not getting it

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
what kind of healer was your race

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
just be like a cleric

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
well you're a human necromancer

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
so I'll be like

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
don't listen to them

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
just calm down

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
that's not a race

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
paladin isn't a race no matter what

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
the alt-right tells you

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
I'll be like

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
what's a good

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
I'll be a

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
can I be a full-on orc cleric

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
no that's not possible

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I don't know about that man

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
oh boy

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
yeah no for sure

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
you could be a gelatinous ooze cleric

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
if you want

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
sounds like that was pretty popular

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
I'll be a gelatinous ooze cleric

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
all right great

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I guess you're not the only one

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
that eats through a g-tube

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
come out here and try to high road everybody

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
what's your character

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
I'm sorry

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
gelatinous cube cleric

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
gelatinous cube

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
wow

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
ooze

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
I said ooze I meant cube

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
it's a cube of ooze

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
it's a large size ooze

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
I believe no it's probably huge right

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
so you're a cube of

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
gelatin but you're a cleric

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
how big do you think

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
what are the dimensions

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
you're about 10 by 10 by 10 maybe 15

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
yeah

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
holy shit

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
I'm a giant cube

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
10 by 10 by 10 by 15

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
that's not a cube

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
10 by 10 by 10 or 15

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
do I speak

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
verbally

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
you speak somatically

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
using pseudopods

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
so I just make myself clear

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
like a hana-barbera character

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
like charade rules

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
like that sand buggy

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
sign language

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
alright

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
who else we got

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
is jeff daniella anyone

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
daniella what do you want to be

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
off the top of my head

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
maybe half tiefling dark rekener warlock

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
what was the

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
the dark rekener was it

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
is that out like a

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
it's a specialization

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
fair enough

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
half what

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
it's a specialization

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
tiefling

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
dark rekening warlock

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
alright

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
san francisco

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
like

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
you're not trying to cause no trouble

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
you're not worried about natalie

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
who keeps getting shit on back in the hot tub

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
well I do worry about natalie

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
but I think natalie signed up for

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
what's your name

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
disruptive vulnerable lady

your name's not natalie what's the other girl's name

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
christina

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
I'm so sorry

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
we're sorry balsam

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
alright here we go

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I'm gonna be

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I'm gonna combine pieces

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
of what I've got here I want to be

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
a

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
a

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
elf

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
druid

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
also I want my thing to be like I want to

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
like fire

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
like an arsonist druid

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
which seems like a bad thing

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
if you like trees

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
right

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
but I hate when people

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
use trees to make buildings

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
so I feel like that was the misuse of a tree

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
they murdered my trees

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I like to burn shit down as a

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
we're definitely lacking

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
in kind of like hack and slash types

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
do you want I could change my gelatinous cube

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
to be more of a fucker

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
true

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
the improv I came up with is really heavy

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
on hack and slash

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
yeah I don't know

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
why I'm like refereeing game balance

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
kettle one

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
a druid

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
an elf druid

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
my name's gonna be Chad

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
the fire liker

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Chad the fire liker

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I'll be very disappointed

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
and I think Michael may be telling christian

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
his necromancer's name

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
his name is going to be rogue

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
it's his old puppy

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
rug or rogue

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
rogue

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000

I'm so excited looking at the

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
advertisements like stormtroopers walking

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000

people for dice and they have them

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000

trumpy zayn

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
these aren't dice these are sugar cubes

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
they're not sugar cubes

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
they're alternative dice

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
episode one

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
harry potter

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
and the syrup of begonias

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
our heroes find themselves

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
in the lobby of hogwarts castle

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
searching for the syrup of begonias

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
you see the sorting hat

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
in the great hall

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
that's all

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
you're in the empty great hall

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
of hogwarts with the sorting hat

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I walk up and I put the hat on my head

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
alright

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
that's the clock

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
is that the hat talking?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
yeah that's the hat

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
I see you're off the clock

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
but you're on my head

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
sure yeah

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
I can't really do anything

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
I'm just a hat

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
why do they call you a sorting hat?

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I don't know what sort

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
do I have eyes?

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
you can see

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
you could sense

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
you might have blind sense

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I sense for exits

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
oh there's so many

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
there's like at least six

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
but I can't talk so I mine

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
there's six exits

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
to my compatriots

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
he jiggles vigorously

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
it's true

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
do I

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
can I do like a sense magic on the sorting hat?

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
oh yeah it's so magic

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
it's an ancient artifact

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
a great power

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
I step aside with the hat on my head

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
like sorting hat

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
what's your name?

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
sorting hat

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
what do you like to get up to?

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
what's your thing?

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
do you like to

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
do you want to sort some shit out right now?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
no I'm off the clock

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
when do you get back on duty?

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
oh this semester doesn't start for weeks

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
do I know the other

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
yeah you guys are all questing for the syrup of begonias

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
have you known each other a long time?

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
oh for as long as

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
is handy

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
sorting hat

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
do you know where the syrup of begonias might be found?

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
oh the syrup of begonias

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
that's somewhere else entirely

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
they're gonna need to go outside

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
and hang a left

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
alright can I continue to wear you?

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
do you want to hang out here?

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
I mean I really I don't care man

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
you don't care?

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
you gotta get like

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I think you have a lot of assumptions

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
about what a hat should or shouldn't be

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I didn't have any until one talked

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
and had a name

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I absorbed the hat

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
like into my

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
gelatin

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
alright yeah

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
it slowly begins to dissolve

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
is it screaming?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
you can't tell

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
the interface with your lack of brain

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
I push

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
it out just

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
enough for its mouth to emerge

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
is it not screaming?

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
no it's not

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
I suck it back in

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
I

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
gesture to the rest of the group

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
to follow me outside and go to the left

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
really quick Michael needs another drink

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
so I will be here

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Dan you're close

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
you got all the fixings right here

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
right?

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
oh I thought you were leaving

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I was like well wait

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
fuck this I need more alcohol

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
for the listeners

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
he has a pyrex

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
or corning whatever

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
measuring cup pouring it into a giant syringe

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
and it's not plunging it into some part

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
of Michael's body

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
if that isn't magic I don't know what's magic

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
the question is busy

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
because he's filling your g-tube

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
your matrix belly

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
is there anything

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
we're all in this Harry Potter

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
commissary

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
it's pissing me off

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
it's pissing me off

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
couldn't make it out

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
he said the hat was pissing him off

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
can we light it on fire?

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I'll squirt it out

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
light it on fire

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I summon the god

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
pyros

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
I summon the god

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
pyros

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
you had 10 chances

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
to be a cool hat

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
motherfucker

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
and I cast

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
a spell of flame

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
on sorting hats

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
this is what all hats want

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:14.760
I feel like Spencer's kind of giving us a free ride on this one.

01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:17.880
I turned, what's Michael's character's name?

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:18.880
Rogue.

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:19.880
Rogue.

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:23.680
I turned to Rogue and I go, well, I killed that hat for you.

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:25.760
You ready to go kick some butt?

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:26.760
Chewing.

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:27.760
Chewing.

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:35.520
I'm sensing, I'm sensing a real fucking lack of motivation in our crew.

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:38.080
No, I'm bouncing out the door.

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:40.640
You're a fucking, you're a blob with no brains.

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:41.640
Whoa.

01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:42.640
Whoa.

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:47.320
You, you sucked in a hat and you spit it back out.

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.320
It's differently abled.

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.320
Yeah.

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:57.720
Like, I'm just saying, like, I, like, I don't know where we're, like, what's, what's the

01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:59.200
motivation here for all of us?

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.840
Like, what do we, what do we want as a group?

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:02.840
To go find the syrup, but go.

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:05.080
Yeah, but you guys are standing around.

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.600
You standing around like a bunch of dinghaw.

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:07.600
I'm moving out.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:08.600
I'm leaving.

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:09.600
I'm leaving.

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:10.600
I'm going out the door.

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:11.600
Okay.

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:12.600
Let's all go out and go to the left.

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:13.600
Like the hat said before.

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:14.600
I, I emulated it.

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:15.600
Yeah.

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.720
You all do that.

01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:20.280
You head outside of Hogsmeade.

01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:22.480
It's a little village.

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:23.600
It's a, it's great.

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:26.040
There's little houses and little huts and stuff.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.280
Oh man.

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:28.280
It's great.

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:30.720
Specifically, there's a big shack.

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:32.000
It's all messed up.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.960
It seems to be all boarded up.

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.960
Oh fuck.

01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:40.480
A village with a hut.

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:44.400
Also other structures.

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:47.280
I, I bounce around my surroundings.

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:52.200
I think, I think the smart move, send the gelatinous cube into the hut first.

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.640
I'm going to eat the boards.

01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:55.640
Is it just one?

01:32:55.640 --> 01:33:00.440
Yeah, I'll squeeze through the boards to take a look with my non eyes.

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.040
You do that.

01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:04.440
It's all dirty and gross.

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:05.440
There's soot.

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:06.440
Oh man.

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:07.440
It sucks.

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:12.960
You see a hole near the ground on a wall.

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:16.200
It seems to be a space between boards.

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:20.640
And in that space, it looks like some sort of tunnel.

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:33.480
I pull my, my gel out of the thing and I look at these guys and I, and I, and I go.

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:36.040
I mime that there's a hole.

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:37.040
Everything he said.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.040
Yeah.

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.040
Because I can't, I can't talk.

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.040
I, I got you.

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:41.040
I knew.

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:42.040
Okay.

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:47.640
And I, and then, and then I just charge through the boards and I head for the hole because

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.880
I'm fearless because I'm goo.

01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:50.880
Yeah.

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:58.640
What, what, what are the stakes like a human's worst case scenario is my beginning.

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:03.080
Like what more is there to be scared of?

01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:06.160
Can I ask why we're looking for the syrup of the gunions?

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:08.240
Well, what purpose would be cool?

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:10.240
Who are you asking?

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:11.240
Anybody.

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:12.240
Okay.

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:13.240
Let's ask Spencer.

01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:14.240
Let's ask you.

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:15.240
Can we, can we table talk that one?

01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:17.240
Oh yeah.

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:23.280
You think back to when your friend Pete asked you to get him the syrup of begonias.

01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:30.760
He says, Pete's like, Pete's like, this is going to be so good.

01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:33.440
These pancakes are going to be great.

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:34.440
Just you wait.

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:43.040
I go, my God, I can't believe I invited you over for pancakes without the syrup of begonias.

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:48.440
I turn to the group and go, oh, Jesus Christ, the big pancake thing happens at Pete's in

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:49.440
like five hours.

01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.040
We got to get this syrup.

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:54.120
The stakes have never been higher.

01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:57.320
I'm doing what you like.

01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:59.080
You're just having a fit.

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:00.760
I go down the hole.

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:01.760
Yeah.

01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.760
All right.

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:03.760
It's a long tunnel.

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:09.400
Oh, man, you're squeezing and oozing.

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:14.840
You go for what seems like a long time and then you find yourself in an open space.

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:17.760
It's open earth in this tunnel at least.

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:24.520
Looking around, you see the walls seem to be made of natural wood or living wood.

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:28.440
It seems like you're inside of a giant tree.

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:31.880
Hey, you guys, I found another room.

01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.880
They can't hear you because you can't talk.

01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:34.880
I know.

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:37.640
It was, it was just a Goonies reference.

01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:38.640
Right.

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.200
It's best left unheard.

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:46.920
It was a little racist.

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:55.800
As data was not a woke character, he was a Japanese gadget fan.

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:58.840
Is the whole big enough for me, Kettle One and Rogue, to fit through as well?

01:35:58.840 --> 01:35:59.840
Oh, yeah.

01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:03.320
I can fit in any hole.

01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:05.280
That's what she just said.

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:10.800
I didn't hear it, not because I'm committing to my character, because I'm a bad listener.

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:11.800
I can't.

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:12.800
Did I can fit in any hole?

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.160
You went to golf nine holes?

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.160
What?

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:19.400
I didn't think the Kettle One was getting me that quick.

01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:20.920
I said, I can fit in any hole.

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:21.920
Oh, you can fit in any hole.

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:22.920
Okay.

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:23.920
All right.

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:24.920
That's what she said.

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:32.480
Let's, let's, let's all charge through that hole and join, what's your name, Gerard?

01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:33.480
Gerard?

01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:34.480
Gerard.

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:35.480
Okay.

01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:36.480
You do that.

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:39.360
You also find yourself within this great tree.

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:42.600
Oh, well, hey guys, I'm a druid, right?

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.600
Yeah.

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:44.600
All right.

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:49.760
And I, I, I want to convene with the wood, do I have like a, like a, like a spell I can

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:50.760
use to kind of.

01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:52.760
You're going to touch the wood?

01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:55.800
That's what she said again.

01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:56.800
Yeah.

01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:02.680
I, I walk up to the tree, it was one of the walls and I, and I started just touching

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.920
that wood.

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:13.200
You, you feel the pain of an ancient, the, the, the, the anger and the rage, the violence,

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:17.560
the violence, so much violence, both from and against the tree.

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:22.040
Oh man, this tree is fucked up.

01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:25.040
This whole, this whole thing is fucked up.

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:30.720
Guys, we got a violent tree here.

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:35.240
I, I can't even ask you anything.

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:37.240
Wiggle harder.

01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:40.240
I thought you could communicate there's some sort of weird, like, yeah, you definitely

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:41.240
can.

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.240
Like Kirby the love bug.

01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:43.240
Like Horna.

01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:45.240
I can mime stuff.

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:52.080
I'll just mime like, is, is the tree know anything about the syrup?

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:56.600
I asked the tree, do you know about the syrup of the begonias and the tree doesn't communicate

01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:07.000
as such, but you search the tree's memory banks and you see a cruel infestation, a corruption

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:14.160
seeping through the surface, purging the wood of goodness and filling it with evil.

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:19.920
That seems like necromancer territory, but I can't say that.

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:31.600
Okay, is it dead, the tree, the stuff oozing out of it, oh, it's, it's, it's wrapped with

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:42.120
death energies.

01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:43.560
You cast a spell to control it.

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:44.560
Oh yeah.

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:51.560
It seems to be an undead sort of sludge made from the souls and bodies of decomposed things

01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:56.120
smashed to death by the tree.

01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:57.120
Good controlling.

01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:59.120
All right.

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:09.480
It fails its will save and is dominated by you.

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:14.840
I wonder if we can turn the sludge into delicious syrup for us.

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.520
That's what he was about to ask, what the hell is the syrup?

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:18.520
Say again?

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:19.760
Where's the syrup?

01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:20.840
This is the syrup.

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:24.040
The syrup is dead, people.

01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:25.040
Yeah.

01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.040
Who said that?

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.040
Who said this is the syrup?

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.360
This, this is his intuition.

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:37.880
I, I, I pick up on it and I mime, this is the syrup.

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:43.000
We're saying we should feed it to him first.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:46.880
When we get it back, if he eats it or consumes it?

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:47.880
There's so much.

01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:52.520
Yeah, to make, to make sure, to make sure it's not poisoned, and if it is, then we only

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:53.520
lose you.

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:59.680
I go way back with Rogue and we, he saved my life in NAM and so I owe him, so I'll, I'll

01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:05.520
slurp it to see if it's poisonous or magical cursed or something.

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.000
It's, it's pretty strong.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:17.000
It seems like you could use some pancakes to cut the flavor or something.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:24.280
I mime, I mime Steve Carell's head on a stack of pancakes from the poster of Dan in Real

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:32.600
Life.

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:38.840
I take out my bucket of plenty.

01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:46.360
It's a magic bucket that holds more than it looks like it should hold.

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.400
From where do you procure this object?

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:52.040
It's one of my druidic magical implements that I carry.

01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:56.720
No, it really leaves the house without a bucket of plenty.

01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:06.960
I got it from an old shaman named Barrel Lady and I take my bucket, I take my, I take

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:12.600
my bucket of plenty and I swoop it into the, to the mystical goo and gather as much as I

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:13.600
can.

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:14.600
All right.

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:15.600
Did you do that?

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:16.600
That's great.

01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:17.600
You got a bucket.

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:18.600
Oh man.

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:23.440
But as you grab the bucket, you feel the impact of wood against wood.

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.960
It's attacking the walls around you.

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.680
Fight!

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:35.080
I don't know what he said because he just kind of jiggled.

01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:38.400
I don't know.

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:44.720
Are we being attacked by wood?

01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:45.720
Other wood?

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:46.720
You aren't.

01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:50.360
You're just feeling this, this, this woody room you're in, this tree-like room you're

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:51.360
in.

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:52.800
It's all getting, getting wailed on.

01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:57.480
Let's take my bucket of plenty full of syrup of begonias and get the fuck out through the

01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:58.960
hole that we came in through.

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:01.960
I fill my five flasks and I too fall asleep.

01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:02.960
Yeah, yeah.

01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:03.960
All right.

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:04.960
Yeah, we got so much stuff.

01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:05.960
You do that.

01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:06.960
You land back in the shack.

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:07.960
It's great.

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:15.160
Oh man, it's not fucked in any way.

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:22.760
I call an Uber and say, let's go to Pete's house and eat these motherfucking pancakes.

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:23.760
Shall I go for it?

01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:24.760
It's going to be the best.

01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:27.760
Oh man, you don't get signal on here.

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:28.760
No.

01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:29.760
It's bad.

01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.760
Some serious shit.

01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:36.080
Kettle one, don't you have dark powers that you could maybe like get us a ride home or

01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:38.080
something like that?

01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.880
Yes.

01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:45.960
You get a dark powered ride home.

01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:46.960
All right.

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:50.800
Well, should we end the D&D session there?

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.520
To make sure they get their festival money's worth, I could do a horrible rap.

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:55.520
Yeah.

01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:56.520
Let me do it.

01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:03.760
But only if Michael is my, like, I want you to be like my Rihanna, like, like...

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:04.760
Beatbox for us.

01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:10.920
Like, I'll rap and then you'll do like, like, you'll do like the hook or something.

01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:11.920
No.

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:17.320
Yeah, that's not going to happen.

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:21.720
It would be a pretty low stakes gig, I feel.

01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:22.720
People will be on your side.

01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:24.400
But look, I won't tell you your business.

01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:29.360
Well, he could say what he would sing and then Christian has to sing it, like he has

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.360
to interpret it.

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:31.360
I mean...

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.360
Look, I don't want to...

01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:40.040
Michael, you could force Christian to do your bidding or Daniela.

01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:41.720
I mean, I got to get it in the zone.

01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:44.120
I don't know about you guys.

01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:46.600
But we're close to being hard out here.

01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:47.600
Yeah, yeah, no.

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:48.600
We got to hurry up.

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:49.600
Yeah.

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:50.600
All right.

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:57.560
So by the time we see each other again, we may be just a part of the New Republic of

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:02.360
California or...

01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:10.280
All wearing camouflage and with like soap dispenser helmets and like weird, like, microchip

01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:11.280
belts and...

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:20.880
We're going to have the best TV and movies and lots of cheese and almonds and roughly

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:24.160
40% of the gross national product as far as I know.

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:28.120
I mean, shouldn't we organize something where we just say, am I going to get shot for saying

01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:29.120
this?

01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:31.440
Is there going to be a laser on my chest as I say this?

01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:37.200
But don't we pay these motherfuckers every quarter a bunch of money?

01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:41.240
Can't we just sit on it and go, we know likey what you talked about?

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:46.880
Like, isn't that how the United States works?

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.880
Is it like money flows from...

01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:51.640
I think it's also how a civil war starts, but I think it is.

01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:53.120
Yeah, like, yeah.

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:54.120
Okay.

01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:55.120
All right.

01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:56.120
I don't...

01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:58.640
Don't want to be your civil war.

01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:00.520
What's so civil about war?

01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:01.520
All right.

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:07.920
Wait, am I correct remembering that Axl Rose, Guns N' Roses rhymed, I don't want to be your

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:12.480
civil war, I don't want to be your human grocery star.

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:14.040
That's a fucking terrible lyric.

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:15.680
Well, let's improve on it.

01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:16.680
Grocery star?

01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:17.680
Wow.

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:18.680
All right.

01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:19.680
Come on, give me a beat.

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:20.680
We're going to do it.

01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:21.680
I'm going to put a beat on a rap.

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:22.680
Before you get beat on.

01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:23.680
Where is it?

01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:24.680
There we go.

01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:25.680
Yeah.

01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:26.680
Yeah.

01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:27.680
Yeah.

01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:28.680
Yeah.

01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:29.680
Yeah.

01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:30.680
Yeah.

01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:31.680
Yeah.

01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:32.680
California.

01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:33.680
C-A-F-L-O-R-N-I-A.

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:38.680
C-A-F-L-O-R-N-I-A.

01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:39.680
California.

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:40.680
California.

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:48.120
Got the biggest date on the leftmost coast.

01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:50.760
We have the TV and we make it the most.

01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:53.280
We also got the Inland Empire.

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:56.040
We got the meth.

01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:58.040
Yeah.

01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:03.080
California is the place to be if you try to go further.

01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:06.400
You'll be in the sea.

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:07.400
California.

01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:08.400
California.

01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:09.400
California.

01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:10.400
California.

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:11.400
Oh, God.

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:12.400
Oh.

01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:13.400
Here's one of me say, uh, Cat-a-one.

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:14.400
Yeah.

01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:15.400
Yeah.

01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:16.400
Yeah.

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.400
Yeah.

01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.400
Left coast, right coast, north-south.

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:30.400
Fuck your mama so hard.

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:32.040
She needed a second mouth.

01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:35.480
She said, Dan Harmon, come to me.

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:42.240
I said, I want to get in the tub and pee on a Russian hooker with Vitamir.

01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:46.600
I'm going to fuck your mama so hard the rush is near to us.

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:49.960
Then it's ever been fucking with the election.

01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:54.280
I fucked your mama in the bargain bed.

01:46:54.280 --> 01:47:04.000
It's a terrible rap because it has an agenda.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:09.760
When you bring politics into rapping, it just takes a bad rapping turn.

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:12.000
The rap should come from the heart.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:19.120
That's why rap doesn't typically, you don't see a lot of rappers in inaugurations.

01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:20.120
Rap comes from the streets.

01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:21.120
It comes from your feelings.

01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:25.640
Because it doesn't, you're not supposed to just be like, you should vote for Jerry Brown.

01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:27.520
All right.

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:28.800
I fucked your mama.

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.680
I fucked her good.

01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:33.960
I fucked her like she was made of wood.

01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:40.520
What that means is that I respected her as if she was a Douglas fir.

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:44.480
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:47.280
Thank you so much.

01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:48.280
Janiella Christian.

01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:50.280
Thank you, San Francisco.

01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:51.280
Thank you, Christian.

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:52.280
Michael.

01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:53.280
Zane.

01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:58.160
Let's send suicide.com, Allison and Christina out there.

01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:00.160
Thank you so much, everybody.

01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:04.160
Friendsforbenefits.org.

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.160
Come get your dice back.

01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:06.160
I'll give you your dice.

01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:07.160
Oh, yeah.

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:08.160
Don't take the shirt off.

01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:20.160
Also, let's hear it for the music I played tonight by Titanic Sinclair, one of our favorites.

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:36.160
Did you get any of that?

01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:50.800
It's a good show.
