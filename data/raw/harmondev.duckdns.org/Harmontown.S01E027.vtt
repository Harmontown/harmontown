{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:12.000\nMusic\n\n00:12.000 --> 00:14.000\nZany's in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:17.000\nMusic\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:22.000\nOh yeah, oh yeah, I don't care what happens in this show, it's already been the best night of my life.\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:25.000\nMusic\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:32.000\nPeople sat here for a good hour and a half, looks like Jim Lill were coming up and playing his heart out for us, totally amazing.\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:34.000\nMusic\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:38.000\nI have very good news for each and every one of you, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:40.000\nMusic\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:43.000\nWelcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:49.000\nMusic\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:50.000\nHe's right there.\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:55.000\nMusic\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:57.000\nKeep going, keep going the right way.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:11.000\nMusic\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:14.000\nMusic city, you lost it.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:16.000\nMusic\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:17.000\nHoly shit.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:19.000\nWow\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:22.000\nWhat a magical, magical day, or is it just that?\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:26.000\nFor my money, I could just walk off stage and go home right now.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:28.000\nWell, maybe not for their money.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:29.000\nNo.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:39.000\nBut I think, but it's noteworthy that, like, we, okay, I just, like, let's go to the timeline, because we've been sitting in the back of the room, like, hanging out with people.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:43.000\nI've been doing Countless Yeager Bombs with people.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:44.000\nYeah, thank you.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:45.000\nIs it Bob, right?\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:46.000\nYeah.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:48.000\nBob and Jen, thank you.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:53.000\nI'm not drunk.\n\n01:53.000 --> 02:01.000\nIt's sleeting and raining and snowing, and there's ice daggers falling out of the sky, and everybody's showed up.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:03.000\nThe show starts at 7.30.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:07.000\nWe're up here at 7.25 on the nugget, or something like that.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:10.000\nWe've been back there since 6.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:16.000\nI don't know how the timing of it works, but it's like, oh, get them in here, get them in here.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:25.000\nI don't know why everybody showed up early, but get them in, get them in, warm them up, light a fire.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:36.000\nAnd then, but then, because we're making this movie, like, one of the weird byproducts of making a documentary is, okay, you can't be playing Prince songs while everyone's sitting around having a good time.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:37.000\nSo, yeah, exactly.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:44.000\nIt's a shitty corporate, it's one of the many little invisible ways that corporate America fucks you over.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:52.000\nLike, like, like, oh god, oh, Wang Chung can't be playing while I'm waiting an hour for the shit I bought a ticket to.\n\n02:52.000 --> 03:01.000\nAnd so, you would be sitting here in abject silence, but we're in Nashville, Jeff, where music was invented three times over.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:09.000\nThe blues was invented here, rock and roll was invented here, and grunge was then invented here.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.000\nIs that true?\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:22.000\nYes, it was in this very bar that Weezers, their van broke down and they said, you know what, let's just, let's just not get dressed up tonight.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:25.000\nYeah, let's wear a checkered shirt and not wash our hair.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:29.000\nAt a club called The Ironic Old Opry.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:38.000\nCountry western, blues, rock and roll, everything, everything that calls itself music, purportedly originated from this fertile crescent in the south.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:42.000\nAlso, Martin Luther King got shot somewhere in the state.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:45.000\nDon't worry about it, not holding you to that.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:50.000\nWe're more focused on the Elvis thing, love you, love you for it.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:54.000\nNo biggie, it's all about balance.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:58.000\nIt's all about perpetuation of cultural infamy.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:07.000\nBut only in this state, only in Nashville, only in this city, could you come in with no music to play when people are sitting and then go,\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:18.000\nhey, anybody able to fill an hour with a guitar and one guy's like, yeah, I got a guitar in my wallet?\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:21.000\nWhat's his name, Joe Lill? Jim Lill.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:25.000\nJoe is Southernford, Jim.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:39.000\nJim Lill, this kid, this little child with his acoustic sick stream came up here and filled like an hour of time while we did younger bombs in the back.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.000\nHe sang songs that he dedicated to Joseph Campbell.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:46.000\nHe sang the community theme at the end.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:57.000\nHe strummed and he hummed and he thumped and he bumped and he's the John Henry of legally clearable music.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:02.000\nThis is the city to be in if you need music.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:08.000\nAlso, we've been working on this Harmontown theme, so we'll probably be bringing people up.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:11.000\nI think there's probably some singers in the audience.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:15.000\nIt's Nashville. Don't shake your head, lady.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:20.000\nI just want to put this out.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:26.000\nI assume there's somebody who can do a mean beatbox in the audience.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:28.000\nI expected a bigger reaction than that.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:36.000\nMaybe not. Maybe Nashville rejects the beatbox as a valid musical instrument.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:37.000\nYou do?\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:39.000\nOh, I do. Thank you.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:41.000\nWhat was your name again?\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:42.000\nGarrett.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:45.000\nCan you stand up and face everybody?\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:51.000\nIs this going to accumulate if I say Neil Patrick Harris?\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nYou probably get that a lot.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:56.000\nYeah, I'm sorry.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nIt's nerd on nerd violence.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nI shouldn't be doing it.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nWho do you get, Dan?\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:03.000\nDo people say you look like somebody?\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.000\nRandy Quaid.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nI get Randy Quaid.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:12.000\nI want to get Bill Murray so bad.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:14.000\nI just make people.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nBill Murray, sometimes people say Bill Murray.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nNo one ever says Bill Murray.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:21.000\nWhat are your neighbors, like the Armenian woman?\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:24.000\nShe always said I look like Russell Crowe.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:28.000\nI miss that so much.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nShe didn't know Russell Crowe's name.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:32.000\nI would always have to tell her.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:35.000\nWho do you look like?\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nHe was a gladiator.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nRussell Crowe, yeah, that's it.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nNow I don't.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nShut up.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nMusic City, Jeff. Music City.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nA couple other nicknames for this town.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:51.000\nThe Athens of the South.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nA lot of schools, museums and whatever.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nJust a lot of columns and things.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nI don't know why. Athens of the South.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:01.000\nI don't get it either.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:04.000\nLittle Kurdistan.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:07.000\nNo one calls it that.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:09.000\nLittle Wikipedia.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nDo we have any Kurds in the crowd tonight?\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:13.000\nAny Kurds here?\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:16.000\nWikipedia would have you wrong.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:20.000\nSupposedly there's the largest U.S. population of Kurds in Nashville.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:24.000\nDo they just hate me?\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:29.000\nI was going to do a whole thing where I...\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:33.000\nI made a bookmark on my phone for Kurdistan.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:36.000\nSo I was going to try to riff like a...\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:43.000\nA Kurd targeting stand-up act.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nYou've been to Kurdistan? Neopatic Harris?\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nWhat's your actual name?\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nGary.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:52.000\nYou've been to Kurdistan under what circumstances?\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nYou were in the Army.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nWhat was your MOS?\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nWhat the hell does that mean?\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:01.000\nA 21 Bravo? What is that?\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nCombat engineer.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:08.000\nWhat are you guys doing? What's going on here?\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nDo you ever scream, scrub a double walnut?\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:13.000\nNo, that's not real. That's not real language.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nI made that up.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nWhat does that actually mean?\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nNo one seems to know the answer to that.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nMilitary occupational specialty.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nMilitary occupational specialty.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nYou were a combat engineer.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:28.000\nDoes that mean you blew up bridges and stuff like that?\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:31.000\nI thought it sounded like a recruiter.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nWhat did you actually do?\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nWell, we actually blew up a lot of artillery shells.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:39.000\nThat's like blowing up unused artillery and stuff?\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nYeah, yeah, it's all over the country.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:42.000\nWere you in Iraq?\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nYeah.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:44.000\nReally? How long did you serve?\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nI was in Iraq for three years.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nLet's hear your yell.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:51.000\nWho? Who?\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:57.000\nHe had a slightly honorable discharge.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nYou are amazing out here,\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:04.000\nbut you cannot be relied upon to selling alpachino.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:07.000\nAnd while that does not win or lose wars,\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nwe have to let you go.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nYeah, he did arrive.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nImagine.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:16.000\nWho is your army?\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:20.000\nWhat's your rank? Are you retired?\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nI was separated.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nSeparated?\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:31.000\nJust wanted to start seeing other branches of the military.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nNo branches.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nYou're just done.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nYeah, that's a rough gig, man.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:40.000\nYou were out in Iraq when things were hairy?\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:45.000\nIt's like a lot of dullness and then a few hairy hours.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:49.000\nIt's like incredibly dull, broken up, and really hairy.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nJust one of those dull afternoons when you're blowing up artillery\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nand stuff like that?\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:57.000\nI saw the Hurt Locker, so I think I know exactly.\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:00.000\nI might as well have been there.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:07.000\nI think hairy weather is half of the capital to make a lot of money.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:11.000\nPeople grab around Iraq and some of these call about themselves all the time.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nYeah, that's what you do.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nTake a nice stroll.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:19.000\nWhat's the worst thing that can happen?\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nThat sounds like such a bummer.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:24.000\nI get Facebook messages from guys that were active service out there.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:26.000\nThey go, I love community.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:27.000\nI'm out here.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:28.000\nI'm in this station and that station.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:29.000\nI'm doing this and that.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:32.000\nI write back to them and go, you fucking stay safe.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:33.000\nWill you just stay safe?\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:34.000\nJust get back home.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:39.000\nI don't know if that's the right response because they never write back.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:44.000\nI don't know if it's because they're like, don't be an asshole.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nTell me who I am.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:47.000\nI don't know.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:51.000\nThey're like, get back here, you fucker.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:55.000\nMy ratings are so low.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:58.000\nThey go, what are you doing out there?\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nYou watch my show?\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:03.000\nThat's the consolidation of the forces.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:08.000\nThat's the limit that you support the troops is to the extent that they have a Nielsen box.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nNashville, Jeff, name for Francis Nash.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nYou know who Francis Nash is.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nYeah, I know, but today.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nHe invented the typewriter.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nNo, he didn't.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nI couldn't forget Francis Nash.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:26.000\nAre there any Francis Nash experts in the audience?\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:33.000\nBecause the city's named, there's a lot of things in the South named after Francis Nash.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nHe was kind of a weird character.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nI couldn't really get a line on it.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:41.000\nI Wikipedia at Nashville and then I was like, who's this Francis Nash guy?\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nHe's a good guy or a bad guy.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nAnd I couldn't really figure it out.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nSo I was wondering if there was anybody here.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:50.000\nDan, I hate to interrupt this trenchant commentary on Nashville,\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:57.000\nbut is there an audience member wearing one of our GoPro cameras on his head down in the front?\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nYes, there is.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nLove it.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:05.000\nSo our asshole director just came and put a camera on your head.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\nHe didn't even ask.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:13.000\nYou're going to get lots of awesome shots of Dan's balls during this.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nIn addition to the two cameras.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:23.000\nThe city's sometimes called the buckle of the Bible Belt.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:29.000\nI would figure my audience wouldn't approve of that, but I think that's mythologically important.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nBut they have the power to unbuckle it.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:36.000\nDon't deny that power.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:41.000\nAll you have to do is go, ugh, and the South's pants fall down.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:44.000\nThe whole country changes.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nBut you can't deny the fact.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:56.000\nI think honestly, we were in Atlanta and I really went to town on how politically or historically important it was that we were in Atlanta.\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:57.000\nI was super charged there.\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:00.000\nHere it could get a little uncomfortable talking about that.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:08.000\nNashville, what eclipses it is that throughout the decades, no matter what comes along musically, Nashville just like, what is it?\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nWhat is it, Jeff?\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:10.000\nWhy do they love music so much?\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:11.000\nWhat's with them?\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:14.000\nI love country music, but I like old country music.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:20.000\nI don't really like the new, what they call the Nashville sound, right?\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nIt's too overproduced for me.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:26.000\nAs Waylon Jennings called it, he goes, it's flat belly country.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:29.000\nCountry musicians should have a pot belly.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:34.000\nHe doesn't like any guy that sings country and has abs.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:37.000\nI think that's a good barometer to go by.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:42.000\nThis is where Garth Brooks invented the wire work, right?\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:48.000\nIf I were to float above the audience, I remember having a big fight with my mom about Garth Brooks.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:50.000\nIt's not important.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nIt sounds pretty important.\n\n13:52.000 --> 14:01.000\nBecause my mom, when I was growing up, she loved country music and then I was like, oh, that Garth Brooks, he knows where it's at because he flies over the audience on a wire.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:05.000\nAnd my mom was like, you know, he's an asshole.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:13.000\nAnd I was like, fuck you, because I was really offended because I was starting to get into country music because Garth Brooks flew over it.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nThat's why I said I didn't want to talk about it.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nI'm just going to cry.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:20.000\nI thought you would not be on the Garth Brooks side.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:21.000\nI had no idea.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:29.000\nI was trying to, I mean, I'm on the arguing with my mom, so no matter what, I'm 40 years old, I'll still have any excuse to fight with my mom.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:32.000\nI was just like, oh, Garth Brooks, he's cool.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nI thought it would make her like me.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:37.000\nAnd then she was like, I don't like Garth Brooks.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:40.000\nAnd I was like, dude, I can't do anything right.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:52.000\nI've been through Nashville, but tonight, the show is kind of early, we get to go out, and I've been told I need to go out and hang out on Broadway and go to some Honky Tonk bars.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:53.000\nThat's what I want to do.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:54.000\nNo?\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:55.000\nHuh?\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nA coyote ugly?\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:58.000\nOkay, I take it back.\n\n14:58.000 --> 14:59.000\nI take it back.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:04.000\nI went to a coyote ugly, Dan, on Thanksgiving a few years ago in New York, and not on purpose.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:08.000\nI was with a friend, and it was Thanksgiving night, and I was with my friend Vanessa.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:15.000\nAnd we were walking around the Lower East Side East Village, and we were trying to find a bar to go into on Thanksgiving.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:20.000\nAnd I was really overdressed, and she went to a fancy restaurant, and we were just trying to find a nice bar to drink in.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:25.000\nBut everything was either closed, or you walked in, and it was so depressing because it was Thanksgiving.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:28.000\nAnd it was just people crying into their beers.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:34.000\nOr there are bars where people are really trying to pretend that they weren't sad, that they weren't with their families.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:39.000\nAnd it was really overcompensating, and it was just too much douchebaggery for one bar to contain.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nAnd so I said, it was freezing out.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\nNot as snow as falling.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:47.000\nAnd we're like, look, whatever the next bar is, good, bad, or indifferent, we're going into that bar.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:48.000\nAnd we see a sign up ahead.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:49.000\nWe can see some neon.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.000\nWe're going to that bar, and a block away, she stops me.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:55.000\nShe goes, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nI'm like, no, we said, we made a deal.\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:00.000\nWe're going into that bar, and she goes, that bar is coyote ugly.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:03.000\nI'm like, fuck it, we're going in.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nSo we go into the coyote ugly.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:11.000\nThere's nobody there except three Korean gentlemen who are really, really trying to just dig it.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:14.000\nThey're hitting numbers at random on the jukebox.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:18.000\nAnd like a George Strait song that George Strait doesn't like comes on.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nHe's ill-fated.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nI stole my toe.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nI stole my toe.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:31.000\nI go to the bar, and now when someone plays the songs that they are required by law, these two poor women that are kind of sexy,\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:35.000\ntake it up on the bar and joylessly dance around for you.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nAnd it's really like, don't do this for me.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:40.000\nLike, whatever they're paying you, I'll double it.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:43.000\nAnd I had this really nice tie on, this Vivian Westwood tie.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:47.000\nAnd this woman, this young girl who's the bartender, I found that she's from Columbia,\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:52.000\nand she was just hot as a Colombian lunch, very sexy.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:59.000\nAnd she jumps up on the bar, pours a shot, pours Cuervo tequila into her mouth,\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:07.000\ngrabs me, squats down from on top of the bar, grabs my head, and spits a mouthful of Cuervo into my mouth.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:11.000\nAnd I was like, swallow the barf.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:15.000\nAnd then she takes some scissors out and grabs my brand new Vivian Westwood tie\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:23.000\nand starts to come at my tie, and I grab her hand like Robert De Niro in Awakenings.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:30.000\nAnd I can't, she's like, you can't wear a fucking tie in here.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:34.000\nYou can't like, wear a fucking tie.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:41.000\nAnd it was that offensive an impression that she was doing of her homeland.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:47.000\nAnd I grabbed her and I thought on my feet and I said, well, my father gave me this in his deathbed.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:50.000\nHe said, my dad's not dead. My dad is not dead. I bought that tie.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:56.000\nAnd she's like, okay, and she's like, well, take it off and put it in your pocket.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:59.000\nBecause the corporation that owns this bar told me I had to cut it off and hit it in the water.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:00.000\nThat's a gimmick.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:04.000\nThere are cameras everywhere. My family is in the back duct tape defaulting chairs.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nYou have no idea how important this is to me.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nWasn't there a TV show called Coyote Ugly?\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:09.000\nIsn't that a good sign?\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:10.000\nA movie.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:11.000\nYeah, okay.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:12.000\nYeah, good sign that nothing.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nPiper Carabou, whatever her name was wasn't a thing.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.000\nJeff, I just noticed these people while you were telling a story.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:22.000\nYeah, she got all the drink orders wrong and it was the worst, but then we ended up having fun because it was so bizarre.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nI'm doing the rest of the show this direction.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:32.000\nI don't know what you guys paid, but this doesn't seem fair.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:37.000\nWhat have we done so far that you didn't want...\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:40.000\nOh, uh...\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nUh-oh, uh-oh.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:44.000\nThere's a civil war happening in Mexico.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nFuck these stage-right audience.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:53.000\nMy podium is awesomely made of plexiglass, so there's perfect crotch action for these people right here.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nLadies?\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:57.000\nHey, Jeff.\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.000\nYes, Dan?\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:01.000\nI talked to a guy back there while we were doing Edgar Bombs.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:05.000\nA authentic Nashvillian.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nYeah?\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nA guy named Josh.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nHe brought Moonshine with him.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:18.000\nAnd I've never had Moonshine and I thought he could come up and give me a taste of Moonshine on stage.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nThat sounds awesomely illegal. Let's bring him up.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:21.000\nJosh, everybody!\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:28.000\nIt's one of the many, many hilarious gimmicks we can do here.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:33.000\nOkay, so a guy is coming up right now.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:36.000\nHe looks like Dan Harmon's younger brother.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:40.000\nAnd he has a brown paper bag that goes on his stage, Josh.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nOkay, that corrects something real quick.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nI'm not an authentic Nashvillian.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nI'm from Knoxville, but...\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:47.000\nHey, hey, hey!\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nBoo!\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:50.000\nBoo!\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:54.000\nI'm representing the hill people who make the Moonshine, so...\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nIt comes in a jar.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nYou have to drink it out of the jar.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nAlright, I'm drinking it out of the jar.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:00.000\nWait, is this...\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nThis is labeled. This is like...\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:07.000\nI don't have a direct connection to the hill people, so I had to do what I could.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nAre you a hill person?\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:10.000\nNo.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nBut I feel like I can represent them.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:13.000\nThat's good, I appreciate that.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nOkay, the Mason jar is being cracked open.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.000\nAlright.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:17.000\nOr potentially.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nCan we get a lady up to listen to us for him?\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nThere we are, we got it.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nWell, let's go to the brim.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:24.000\nThere you go.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nYeah, we learned a little bit of it.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nDo I drink the whole jar?\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nNo, you...\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nThat'll be a very different time and time.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:52.000\nWell, I'm proud to be from Nashville\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:55.000\nIn the birth of the music scene\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:58.000\nI'm drinking white latin thunder\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:01.000\nAnd you know my mother knows what you mean\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:04.000\nI got a Elvis on the lip set\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:07.000\nGot some Beatles on the right\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:12.000\nI'm gonna go and do a southern thing tonight\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:16.000\nI got a moonshine and a wake warm wiggie\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:19.000\nWhoop whoop, David Duke, David\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:29.000\nI'm Dan Harmon doing the southern thing\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\nOh, shit.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nThat tastes like...\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:34.000\nWhat does it taste like?\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:37.000\nThat tastes like a...\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nIt's probably watered down.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nTrambulli or...\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:41.000\nNo, it's like...\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:42.000\nYou know what it tastes like?\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:43.000\nAnd I don't mean...\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:44.000\nIt tastes like grappa.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\nI think that's Italian moonshine.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:47.000\nIt's really nice.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nIt's hill grappa.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:53.000\nIt tastes like a fight with my girlfriend.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:57.000\nIt tastes like tonight Aaron and I are gonna have a fight.\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:01.000\nNo, you could probably run your car on this.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:04.000\nWhat is the proof on this thing, you know?\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:05.000\n40, 50%.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\n100 proof.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:10.000\nWhy is there a barcode?\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nIt's called Old Smoky.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.000\nOld Smoky Tennessee Moonshine.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:17.000\nIt's quite good from Gatlinburg, Tennessee.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nI kind of...\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:20.000\nIt's good.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nThe second sip tastes better than the third.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:23.000\nYeah.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nWait, I mean...\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:28.000\nAnd then time pulled it in on itself.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:31.000\nOh, boy.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:34.000\nOkay, well, you drink it from a jar and...\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:35.000\nYeah.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:38.000\nThank you, Josh.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:39.000\nNashville.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:41.000\nI love it.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nThis is the best.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:46.000\nI think all shows should start with us at the bar, with the crowd,\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:49.000\nwith a local busker up here laying down the jams,\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:52.000\nand a dude comes up and just gives us booze.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:53.000\nYeah.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nI don't know if they'd agree.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nI mean, we were thinking back there,\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nlike, let's start the show just earlier,\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:01.000\nbut then, like, we didn't know if anyone was gonna show up\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nat the appropriate time.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:07.000\nThen they'd come in and we'd be doing, like, a raffle.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:10.000\nI feel like we should get Jim Lill up here at some point\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nand have a guitar maybe improvise.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nI should.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nHere's what I want to do in Nashville.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nLike, if we do nothing else,\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:18.000\nbecause it's music sitting USA,\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nI'm sorry I'm gonna be burping.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:21.000\nAre you okay?\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:22.000\nMoonshine.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:25.000\nYou know a comic died here in 1983, the year it opened.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.000\nI was talking to the owner.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:27.000\nIt was not

34:25.140\nI'm in a club called Sadie's in Nashville.\n\n34:25.140 --> 34:29.140\nI hope I can use the whole Tinker Price film.\n\n34:29.140 --> 34:31.140\nI hope I can get them able to give me something.\n\n34:31.140 --> 34:34.140\nWell, she's doing it at the same time as I'm rapping.\n\n34:34.140 --> 34:36.140\nThat's so confusing.\n\n34:36.140 --> 34:37.140\nIt's so weird.\n\n34:37.140 --> 34:41.140\nIt's happening at the same time as my beard.\n\n34:41.140 --> 34:45.140\nCome on down to Harmontown, turn that brown upside down.\n\n34:45.140 --> 34:48.140\nCome on down to Harmontown, turn that brown upside down.\n\n34:48.140 --> 34:49.140\nIt's weird.\n\n34:49.140 --> 34:52.140\nCome on down to Harmontown, turn that brown upside down.\n\n34:52.140 --> 34:53.140\nI'm going to hang back.\n\n34:53.140 --> 34:54.140\nI'm going to...\n\n34:54.140 --> 34:55.140\nAll right.\n\n34:55.140 --> 34:56.140\nOkay.\n\n34:56.140 --> 34:57.140\nAll right.\n\n34:57.140 --> 34:58.140\nOkay.\n\n34:58.140 --> 34:59.140\nYeah.\n\n34:59.140 --> 35:00.140\nBravo.\n\n35:01.140 --> 35:05.140\nAshley, we opened in three nights.\n\n35:05.140 --> 35:07.140\nAll right.\n\n35:07.140 --> 35:11.140\nAnd there's not a single person in Nashville that can do percussion.\n\n35:11.140 --> 35:12.140\nOh, Josh.\n\n35:12.140 --> 35:13.140\nWow.\n\n35:13.140 --> 35:15.140\nJosh.\n\n35:15.140 --> 35:16.140\nJosh.\n\n35:16.140 --> 35:19.140\nPreveyor of corn squeezes and percussion.\n\n35:19.140 --> 35:20.140\nDan, are you okay?\n\n35:20.140 --> 35:21.140\nYeah.\n\n35:21.140 --> 35:24.140\nYou're hanging by a thread over there.\n\n35:24.140 --> 35:26.140\nI've never seen you like this, man.\n\n35:26.140 --> 35:30.140\nGive me one more sip of the...\n\n35:30.140 --> 35:33.140\nNow, Ashley and Jim and Josh, we're going to send you back.\n\n35:33.140 --> 35:35.140\nWe're going to bring you back up later on for the...\n\n35:35.140 --> 35:36.140\nFor the finale.\n\n35:36.140 --> 35:37.140\nYeah, for the reprise.\n\n35:37.140 --> 35:38.140\nAll right.\n\n35:38.140 --> 35:39.140\nWe'll start practicing.\n\n35:39.140 --> 35:40.140\nAll right.\n\n35:40.140 --> 35:41.140\nGood.\n\n35:41.140 --> 35:42.140\nYeah.\n\n35:42.140 --> 35:43.140\nYeah.\n\n35:43.140 --> 35:44.140\nGoing back and make the G chord match to the C chord.\n\n35:44.140 --> 35:45.140\nNo, that's Nashville.\n\n35:45.140 --> 35:47.140\nNo, that's exactly how it works.\n\n35:47.140 --> 35:48.140\nYeah.\n\n35:48.140 --> 35:49.140\nAbsolutely.\n\n35:49.140 --> 35:50.140\nNo.\n\n35:50.140 --> 35:55.140\nJosh, Jim, Tracy, Morgan.\n\n35:55.140 --> 35:57.140\nTracy Morgan was there?\n\n35:57.140 --> 35:58.140\nAll right.\n\n35:58.140 --> 36:02.140\nI suppose now it's time to bring up our Dungeon Master Spencer Crittenden.\n\n36:02.140 --> 36:09.140\nOh, shit.\n\n36:09.140 --> 36:14.140\nOh, shit.\n\n36:14.140 --> 36:18.140\nOh, shit.\n\n36:18.140 --> 36:20.140\nOh, shit.\n\n36:20.140 --> 36:22.140\nMicrophone.\n\n36:22.140 --> 36:29.140\nThat's, that's accurate.\n\n36:29.140 --> 36:37.140\nNashville.\n\n36:37.140 --> 36:38.140\nThank God.\n\n36:38.140 --> 36:39.140\nHow are you doing, Spencer?\n\n36:39.140 --> 36:40.140\nWe're starting to keep you waiting so long, man.\n\n36:40.140 --> 36:41.140\nWhat's up?\n\n36:41.140 --> 36:42.140\nOh, no, it's all good.\n\n36:42.140 --> 36:47.140\nI was, I was just in the back there.\n\n36:47.140 --> 36:50.140\nYou're sharpening your dice?\n\n36:50.140 --> 36:52.140\nYou soak them in alcohol.\n\n36:52.140 --> 36:53.140\nIs that true?\n\n36:53.140 --> 36:54.140\nYeah.\n\n36:54.140 --> 36:57.140\nIt appeases the, the God's of luck.\n\n36:57.140 --> 37:01.140\nWell, I've soaked, I've been soaking myself in alcohol and I'm very appeased.\n\n37:01.140 --> 37:04.140\nWell, I can't roll you too easily, but let's see.\n\n37:04.140 --> 37:05.140\nDo you want some moonshine?\n\n37:05.140 --> 37:06.140\nDo you drink?\n\n37:06.140 --> 37:08.140\nThis is bad, bad.\n\n37:08.140 --> 37:09.140\nSpencer, have some moonshine.\n\n37:09.140 --> 37:10.140\nYou can't have two.\n\n37:10.140 --> 37:12.140\nWe're in Nashville.\n\n37:12.140 --> 37:17.140\nBecause now Spencer, Spencer on the road is, he's a huge fan of Mountain Dew.\n\n37:17.140 --> 37:20.140\nMountain Dew is originally a slang term for moonshine.\n\n37:20.140 --> 37:21.140\nYeah.\n\n37:21.140 --> 37:23.140\nBecause they made it, they made it by the moonlight.\n\n37:23.140 --> 37:27.140\nYeah, I don't know what to do with a thing.\n\n37:27.140 --> 37:29.140\nSo this is some real Mountain Dew.\n\n37:29.140 --> 37:32.140\nIf I vomit, you guys, don't hold it against me.\n\n37:32.140 --> 37:34.140\nI never will.\n\n37:34.140 --> 37:39.140\nI'll slather myself in it.\n\n37:39.140 --> 37:43.140\nMy lips are numb.\n\n37:43.140 --> 37:45.140\nHe announced it.\n\n37:45.140 --> 37:47.140\nThis is a tour of firsts.\n\n37:47.140 --> 37:52.140\nWe certainly are the first comedy tour I think to travel on a tour bus with our own Dungeon Master.\n\n37:52.140 --> 37:58.140\nAlmost certainly we're the first show to have a Dungeon Master drink moonshine before mastering a dungeon.\n\n37:58.140 --> 38:01.140\nSo this is probably the last.\n\n38:01.140 --> 38:04.140\nAll right, do you want to dispense our character sheets there?\n\n38:04.140 --> 38:06.140\nYeah, we're going to need Erin up here then.\n\n38:06.140 --> 38:09.140\nLet's bring up Erin McGathy.\n\n38:09.140 --> 38:12.140\nErin McGathy, dance girlfriend, Mulrainee Sidhanna.\n\n38:12.140 --> 38:19.140\nErin everyone.\n\n38:19.140 --> 38:25.140\nI love your Nashville style.\n\n38:25.140 --> 38:29.140\nHow would you define Nashville style?\n\n38:29.140 --> 38:31.140\nKindness from strangers.\n\n38:31.140 --> 38:37.140\nIt's kind of hospitality in a, not North region, but like below it.\n\n38:37.140 --> 38:38.140\nNashville style.\n\n38:38.140 --> 38:40.140\nCan I get some of that moonshine?\n\n38:40.140 --> 38:42.140\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n38:42.140 --> 38:46.140\nI want to commit to this fight that we're having later.\n\n38:46.140 --> 38:47.140\nWhat should we fight about?\n\n38:47.140 --> 38:50.140\nI feel like I drink a tree.\n\n38:50.140 --> 38:52.140\nIt just feels like drinking a tree.\n\n38:52.140 --> 38:53.140\nIt's really good.\n\n38:53.140 --> 38:54.140\nIt's so good.\n\n38:54.140 --> 38:57.140\nAnd you know, drinking too much makes Spencer sick.\n\n38:57.140 --> 39:00.140\nYeah, that's why I said the vomit thing.\n\n39:00.140 --> 39:03.140\nI just want to be cool, you guys.\n\n39:03.140 --> 39:06.140\nSpencer, you're in safe surroundings.\n\n39:06.140 --> 39:13.140\nWe'll take very good care of you unless that guy poisons everyone.\n\n39:13.140 --> 39:14.140\nI think it takes five.\n\n39:14.140 --> 39:16.140\nIt's like water.\n\n39:16.140 --> 39:17.140\nIt tastes like water.\n\n39:17.140 --> 39:21.140\nNo, it doesn't.\n\n39:21.140 --> 39:24.140\nI always drink my water from under the sink.\n\n39:24.140 --> 39:26.140\nWho's got the lip?\n\n39:26.140 --> 39:27.140\nI got it.\n\n39:27.140 --> 39:28.140\nCan I?\n\n39:28.140 --> 39:29.140\nYeah.\n\n39:29.140 --> 39:32.140\nWe're all going to fuck tonight, you guys.\n\n39:32.140 --> 39:37.140\nSpencer, if you would, get us up to date.\n\n39:37.140 --> 39:42.140\nLast time, Sharpie and Court parted ways with Mulrainee, the half elf.\n\n39:42.140 --> 39:48.140\nThe ranger had some business to attend to elsewhere with arrows and possibly magic belts to locate.\n\n39:48.140 --> 39:55.140\nThe duo pressed onwards, hoping to arrive in time to assist Mango against the threat of Admiral Darkstar's Dark Armada.\n\n39:55.140 --> 40:03.140\nArriving at the scene of a great battle, the heroes watched in horror as legions of cylindrical constructs pushed back the barbarian horde.\n\n40:03.140 --> 40:06.140\nThe cylinders seemed to be pressing towards a great excavation site.\n\n40:06.140 --> 40:15.140\nA huge pit are in the ground near the yellow camp. In a moment of clarity or madness, Sharpie leapt into action and hurled Quark at one of the floating cylinders.\n\n40:15.140 --> 40:24.140\nClinging on for dear life, Quark could only watch in confusion as the swarm of cylinders descended into the pit, retrieving a massive golem.\n\n40:24.140 --> 40:28.140\nA flying ship reeled it in and then flew away with Quark in tow.\n\n40:28.140 --> 40:31.140\nThe cylindrical army retreated to the ship.\n\n40:31.140 --> 40:35.140\nThe ship sailed north. The group was split.\n\n40:35.140 --> 40:39.140\nI don't know if you heard that podcast.\n\n40:39.140 --> 40:49.140\nI reluctantly clung onto a flying cylinder and boarded a giant spaceship, which is presumably Admiral Darkstar's mother ship.\n\n40:49.140 --> 40:51.140\nPerhaps.\n\n40:51.140 --> 40:55.140\nI'm separated from Sharpie and Mulraine for the first time.\n\n40:55.140 --> 40:59.140\nI should mention that your healing pendant has brought you back to full health.\n\n40:59.140 --> 41:01.140\nSo I'm back to 40 hit points?\n\n41:01.140 --> 41:06.140\nYeah. 40 hit points, motherfucker!\n\n41:06.140 --> 41:12.140\nHIT POINTS!\n\n41:12.140 --> 41:14.140\n40 hit points.\n\n41:14.140 --> 41:17.140\nNo, not me.\n\n41:17.140 --> 41:20.140\nI'm sorry, it's the moonshine. I'm sorry.\n\n41:20.140 --> 41:23.140\nOh boy, I love hit points.\n\n41:23.140 --> 41:25.140\nOkay, sorry.\n\n41:25.140 --> 41:27.140\nDo I go first or what?\n\n41:27.140 --> 41:30.140\nIf you want to decide for yourselves or I could roll randomly.\n\n41:30.140 --> 41:32.140\nI'll decide to go first.\n\n41:32.140 --> 41:33.140\nAlright.\n\n41:33.140 --> 41:35.140\nI examine my new strange surroundings.\n\n41:35.140 --> 41:41.140\nHanging on for dear life on the Candroid, you watch as a line of the constructs flies back into the ship.\n\n41:41.140 --> 41:44.140\nThe room you're now inside of is large, full of metal racks.\n\n41:44.140 --> 41:49.140\nSeveral circular hatches on the floor look as if they exit out from the bottom of the ship.\n\n41:49.140 --> 41:55.140\nThe Candroids float onto metal racks before settling down into place with light clunks.\n\n41:55.140 --> 41:59.140\nYou can hear the hum of large machinery coming from all around you.\n\n41:59.140 --> 42:04.140\nAwww.\n\n42:04.140 --> 42:06.140\nUm.\n\n42:06.140 --> 42:09.140\nSo are there any doors in the room I'm in?\n\n42:09.140 --> 42:12.140\nYou can see a large metal door opposite the hatch you came in on.\n\n42:12.140 --> 42:15.140\nAbove you is a metal lavator leading to a hatch in the ceiling.\n\n42:15.140 --> 42:17.140\nI climb the ladder.\n\n42:17.140 --> 42:19.140\nYou climb the ladder?\n\n42:19.140 --> 42:20.140\nThank you.\n\n42:20.140 --> 42:23.140\nNow you're at the hatch. It is closed.\n\n42:23.140 --> 42:26.140\nI use all my barbarian strength to open the hatch.\n\n42:26.140 --> 42:29.480\nYou use all of your barbarian str- No, it just opens.\n\n42:29.480 --> 42:30.480\nYeah, okay.\n\n42:30.480 --> 42:38.480\nAs you poke your head through the hatch, you can see the slithering yellow demons that\n\n42:38.480 --> 42:40.440\nyou fought before.\n\n42:40.440 --> 42:43.400\nThey wail, painful wails as they move about.\n\n42:43.400 --> 42:45.240\nThey take no notice of you.\n\n42:45.240 --> 42:48.240\nMetal pipes, tubes, and gauges are lining the walls of the chamber.\n\n42:48.240 --> 42:50.760\nYou can see three doors, left, right, and center.\n\n42:50.760 --> 42:53.320\nAre those doors labeled in any way?\n\n42:53.320 --> 42:55.320\nLeft, right, and center.\n\n42:55.320 --> 43:03.880\nThat's good thinking.\n\n43:03.880 --> 43:05.800\nCan I make it to a door undetected?\n\n43:05.800 --> 43:08.000\nYou can certainly try.\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:14.160\nI use my gnome ability to sneak, and I sneak towards the first door, the left door.\n\n43:14.160 --> 43:17.240\nAll right, do you have any ranks and move silently?\n\n43:17.240 --> 43:18.240\nDon't I?\n\n43:18.240 --> 43:19.240\nProbably not, but...\n\n43:19.240 --> 43:21.640\nI thought I was good at sneaking about.\n\n43:21.640 --> 43:22.640\nUh, maybe.\n\n43:22.640 --> 43:23.640\nI have fast movement.\n\n43:23.640 --> 43:24.640\nI use my fast movement.\n\n43:24.640 --> 43:27.600\nAll right.\n\n43:27.600 --> 43:29.800\nMoving swiftly, you cross the floor.\n\n43:29.800 --> 43:30.800\nYou make it towards the...\n\n43:30.800 --> 43:31.800\nWhat door?\n\n43:31.800 --> 43:32.800\nThe center door?\n\n43:32.800 --> 43:33.800\nLeft door.\n\n43:33.800 --> 43:34.800\nLeft door.\n\n43:34.800 --> 43:35.800\nThis door is locked.\n\n43:35.800 --> 43:38.100\nThere's strange script written on the door.\n\n43:38.100 --> 43:39.760\nYou don't understand the language.\n\n43:39.760 --> 43:43.360\nI go to the center door.\n\n43:43.360 --> 43:46.200\nYou approach the center door.\n\n43:46.200 --> 43:50.640\nYou hear the sound of large explosions coming from the other side of the door.\n\n43:50.640 --> 43:51.640\nNice.\n\n43:51.640 --> 43:54.320\nI open the door.\n\n43:54.320 --> 43:58.680\nYou open the door, and what you see is so...\n\n43:58.680 --> 44:00.480\nWe cut to another character.\n\n44:00.480 --> 44:01.480\nOkay.\n\n44:01.480 --> 44:02.480\nAll right.\n\n44:02.480 --> 44:03.480\nYeah.\n\n44:03.480 --> 44:04.480\nAct Break.\n\n44:04.480 --> 44:05.480\nGoldbond powder.\n\n44:05.480 --> 44:11.000\nSharpie, you're standing out front of Yellow Camp.\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.040\nCorpses and destroyed machines litter the ground.\n\n44:13.040 --> 44:15.960\nThe remaining barbarians are hauling their own into the Great Tent.\n\n44:15.960 --> 44:19.640\nThe gnolls are also gathered around their dead, but rather than bearing or hauling the corpses,\n\n44:19.640 --> 44:23.320\nthe gnolls strip their breath in and then consume the fallen.\n\n44:23.320 --> 44:24.320\nSome is never glamorous.\n\n44:24.320 --> 44:25.320\nYes.\n\n44:25.320 --> 44:27.560\nYou can see your father standing at the entrance of the Great Tent.\n\n44:27.560 --> 44:29.200\nHe's surveying the work being done.\n\n44:29.200 --> 44:33.560\nFrom the east, you can see a horse and rider, fast approaching.\n\n44:33.560 --> 44:34.560\nDad.\n\n44:34.560 --> 44:35.560\nYes?\n\n44:35.560 --> 44:36.560\nI mean...\n\n44:36.560 --> 44:37.560\nYes.\n\n44:37.560 --> 44:40.560\nCome clean with me.\n\n44:40.560 --> 44:42.040\nWhat the hell's going on?\n\n44:42.040 --> 44:43.040\nWho's this...\n\n44:43.040 --> 44:44.480\nWho's this Admiral Darkstar?\n\n44:44.480 --> 44:45.480\nI don't know.\n\n44:45.480 --> 44:47.840\nThey just came down in those ships.\n\n44:47.840 --> 44:48.920\nDid you see that shit?\n\n44:48.920 --> 44:51.160\nThat was crazy.\n\n44:51.160 --> 44:59.160\nThe sky opened up, but okay, I got some bad news to tell you.\n\n44:59.160 --> 45:02.880\nYou know how I said I had a couple of shards?\n\n45:02.880 --> 45:05.080\nThey're gone.\n\n45:05.080 --> 45:08.520\nI still have yet to poop out that other one, but...\n\n45:08.520 --> 45:10.000\nWait, what do you mean?\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:11.800\nI think they've been stolen.\n\n45:11.800 --> 45:12.800\nDad.\n\n45:12.800 --> 45:13.800\nGas.\n\n45:13.800 --> 45:16.600\nYou know what?\n\n45:16.600 --> 45:20.720\nI grew up my whole life thinking that you thought I was a piece of shit.\n\n45:20.720 --> 45:24.120\nI come back, turns out you're a piece of shit.\n\n45:24.120 --> 45:26.880\nWell, that's the barbarian way.\n\n45:26.880 --> 45:29.120\nWell, he does a little dance.\n\n45:29.120 --> 45:30.120\nWhat was that?\n\n45:30.120 --> 45:33.200\nThat's the barbarian way.\n\n45:33.200 --> 45:34.320\nIt's like Nashville style.\n\n45:34.320 --> 45:35.320\nNashville style.\n\n45:35.320 --> 45:37.320\nWell, but Nashville style.\n\n45:37.320 --> 45:38.320\nOh, wait.\n\n45:38.320 --> 45:39.320\nNope.\n\n45:39.320 --> 45:40.320\nOh, boy.\n\n45:40.320 --> 45:41.320\nOkay, lame.\n\n45:41.320 --> 45:42.320\nYeah, lame.\n\n45:42.320 --> 45:43.320\nFine.\n\n45:43.320 --> 45:46.000\nI accept that I'm lame.\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.680\nWhere did your friend go?\n\n45:48.680 --> 45:54.360\nI hoisted him onto a cylinder, and he's now in the mothership of these things that you're\n\n45:54.360 --> 45:56.880\nfighting with that you don't know anything about.\n\n45:56.880 --> 46:00.280\nAnd I'm a piece of shit?\n\n46:00.280 --> 46:04.040\nAre you going to go after him?\n\n46:04.040 --> 46:06.280\nI'd like to.\n\n46:06.280 --> 46:07.760\nOkay.\n\n46:07.760 --> 46:10.560\nWell, can you fly?\n\n46:10.560 --> 46:12.360\nYou're a wizard, right?\n\n46:12.360 --> 46:13.360\nA wizard?\n\n46:13.360 --> 46:14.360\nOh, oh.\n\n46:14.360 --> 46:15.360\nA wizard.\n\n46:15.360 --> 46:16.360\nI'm sorry, dad.\n\n46:16.360 --> 46:17.360\nI've had a lot to drink.\n\n46:17.360 --> 46:18.920\nI can't enunciate.\n\n46:18.920 --> 46:19.920\nYes.\n\n46:19.920 --> 46:20.920\nI'm a wizard.\n\n46:20.920 --> 46:21.920\nI don't know.\n\n46:21.920 --> 46:24.040\nI can't, dad, I can't fly.\n\n46:24.040 --> 46:27.200\nI can feather fall when you throw me out a window.\n\n46:27.200 --> 46:33.840\nI can abate physical feeling when you hit me with a belt.\n\n46:33.840 --> 46:40.880\nI can create a bubble around myself emotionally when you make me feel like a piece of shit.\n\n46:40.880 --> 46:42.040\nThat's not even magic.\n\n46:42.040 --> 46:46.320\nThat's just therapy.\n\n46:46.320 --> 46:48.560\nWhat is therapy?\n\n46:48.560 --> 46:53.000\nDad, I love you.\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:54.000\nI hug him.\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:58.160\nI give him a plus one hug.\n\n46:58.160 --> 46:59.160\nOnly one?\n\n46:59.160 --> 47:00.160\nYeah.\n\n47:00.160 --> 47:03.880\nHug successful.\n\n47:03.880 --> 47:05.680\nYou seem to have broken through.\n\n47:05.680 --> 47:07.600\nDad, don't you get it?\n\n47:07.600 --> 47:10.560\nPower doesn't have a definition.\n\n47:10.560 --> 47:11.840\nSome of us are magicians.\n\n47:11.840 --> 47:13.440\nSome of us are barbarians.\n\n47:13.440 --> 47:14.640\nPower is power.\n\n47:14.640 --> 47:19.160\nThere's nothing more important than the bond between father and son.\n\n47:19.160 --> 47:20.160\nYou're a barbarian.\n\n47:20.160 --> 47:22.480\nI'm a magic user.\n\n47:22.480 --> 47:23.480\nThat's the way it goes.\n\n47:23.480 --> 47:26.000\nThe important thing is our name.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:29.440\nWe've got to bring these fucking ships down.\n\n47:29.440 --> 47:32.320\nMy friend is up on one of them.\n\n47:32.320 --> 47:33.320\nWhat are you doing?\n\n47:33.320 --> 47:36.240\nLogging in my iPad.\n\n47:36.240 --> 47:37.240\nYou've touched him.\n\n47:37.240 --> 47:38.240\nYou've touched him.\n\n47:38.240 --> 47:39.240\nYour words have touched him.\n\n47:39.240 --> 47:40.240\nAll right.\n\n47:40.240 --> 47:43.480\nThe hug was touching.\n\n47:43.480 --> 47:44.760\nNothing occurs.\n\n47:44.760 --> 47:46.440\nHe says, you're right.\n\n47:46.440 --> 47:50.600\nYou are my son and you're greater at magic than I will ever be.\n\n47:50.600 --> 47:52.680\nSo now it's time for you to have this.\n\n47:52.680 --> 47:56.880\nHe takes the multicolored cloak off his shoulders and bestows it upon you.\n\n47:56.880 --> 48:02.000\nHe says, this cloak is made from the very canvas that forms these great tents and is\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.360\ninfused with great magic.\n\n48:04.360 --> 48:07.280\nIt can give you the power of limited teleportation.\n\n48:07.280 --> 48:24.720\nI got it by a minute, by a minute, hour by hour, I got a cloak from my dad, now I can\n\n48:24.720 --> 48:25.720\ngo places.\n\n48:25.720 --> 48:26.720\nWhoa.\n\n48:26.720 --> 48:27.720\nYeah.\n\n48:27.720 --> 48:28.720\nAll races.\n\n48:28.720 --> 48:29.720\nOh shit.\n\n48:29.720 --> 48:30.720\nAll right.\n\n48:30.720 --> 48:31.720\nSorry.\n\n48:31.720 --> 48:32.720\nA little dance break.\n\n48:32.720 --> 48:33.720\nYeah.\n\n48:33.720 --> 48:34.720\nAll races.\n\n48:34.720 --> 48:40.840\nMulraine, you're among the trees in a small grove.\n\n48:40.840 --> 48:41.840\nI.\n\n48:41.840 --> 48:45.960\nFew venture to this grove as knowledge of the magical forest died along with your five children\n\n48:45.960 --> 48:48.440\nin the massive blaze that consumed your home.\n\n48:48.440 --> 48:49.440\nYes.\n\n48:49.440 --> 48:50.440\nI remember.\n\n48:50.440 --> 48:52.960\nI think about it every day.\n\n48:52.960 --> 49:01.160\nYou hear the winning and neighing of a struggling horse not far off breaking your meditation.\n\n49:01.160 --> 49:02.960\nIs there an animal in pain?\n\n49:02.960 --> 49:04.720\nI rushed to the animal.\n\n49:04.720 --> 49:05.720\nWinnie.\n\n49:05.720 --> 49:06.720\nNay.\n\n49:06.720 --> 49:11.080\nYou see a horse tied to a tree and a woman sitting on the ground propped up against\n\n49:11.080 --> 49:12.080\na tree.\n\n49:12.080 --> 49:15.440\nUpon closer inspection, he realized the woman is dead.\n\n49:15.440 --> 49:18.360\nHer throat is slit and a dagger is sitting on the ground nearby.\n\n49:18.360 --> 49:22.760\nThere's a piece of parchment on the paper.\n\n49:22.760 --> 49:23.960\nIt's a harsh world.\n\n49:23.960 --> 49:24.960\nThere's monsters and.\n\n49:24.960 --> 49:28.600\nThere are spaceships and I'm dealing with a mutilated woman.\n\n49:28.600 --> 49:31.120\nIt's important.\n\n49:31.120 --> 49:37.400\nDear woman, I, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n\n49:37.400 --> 49:39.320\nI must, I must bury you.\n\n49:39.320 --> 49:44.320\nI must show you the honor that my children were not shown.\n\n49:44.320 --> 49:45.320\nI.\n\n49:45.320 --> 49:46.320\nShe doesn't respond.\n\n49:46.320 --> 49:47.320\nNo.\n\n49:47.320 --> 49:51.360\nNo, you must be awake, please, wake up, please.\n\n49:51.360 --> 49:57.960\nI slap her face in the sad way when someone does a movie based on a Michael Crichton film.\n\n49:57.960 --> 50:03.160\nI keep on slapping her face.\n\n50:03.160 --> 50:04.160\nYep.\n\n50:04.160 --> 50:08.680\nI, I, I try to untie the horse.\n\n50:08.680 --> 50:10.680\nYou untie the horse.\n\n50:10.680 --> 50:14.440\nIt stands and regards you.\n\n50:14.440 --> 50:20.960\nDear horse, I regard you as well.\n\n50:20.960 --> 50:22.960\nI nuzzle the horse.\n\n50:22.960 --> 50:26.360\nThe horse is nuzzled.\n\n50:26.360 --> 50:29.360\nIt seems as if it, it wants to say something.\n\n50:29.360 --> 50:30.360\nYeah.\n\n50:30.360 --> 50:35.720\nNo, not like that.\n\n50:35.720 --> 50:37.120\nYou have wild empathy.\n\n50:37.120 --> 50:38.600\nYou can empathize with the horse.\n\n50:38.600 --> 50:40.760\nIt seems to say.\n\n50:40.760 --> 50:42.560\nI use my wild empathy.\n\n50:42.560 --> 50:49.080\nYou can, you can ride on me.\n\n50:49.080 --> 50:52.360\nHorses aren't very eloquent.\n\n50:52.360 --> 50:56.360\nDear horse, I hear your message and I shall do your bidding.\n\n50:56.360 --> 50:58.360\nI will ride you.\n\n50:58.360 --> 51:00.360\nAll right.\n\n51:00.360 --> 51:03.360\nThe horses just stand there now.\n\n51:03.360 --> 51:05.360\nThat, that horse is standing there.\n\n51:05.360 --> 51:06.360\nOkay.\n\n51:06.360 --> 51:10.360\nI leap upon the horse and I'm really cute when I do it.\n\n51:10.360 --> 51:15.360\nLeaping upon the saddle, you notice a bit of paper sticking outside the saddle.\n\n51:15.360 --> 51:17.360\nI ignore the paper.\n\n51:17.360 --> 51:19.360\nYou ignore the paper.\n\n51:19.360 --> 51:21.360\nI pick up the paper.\n\n51:21.360 --> 51:22.360\nI read the paper.\n\n51:22.360 --> 51:23.360\nI read the paper.\n\n51:23.360 --> 51:24.360\nI read the paper.\n\n51:24.360 --> 51:25.360\nNever, never read the paper.\n\n51:25.360 --> 51:26.360\nProbably nothing.\n\n51:26.360 --> 51:31.360\nTo whoever reads this, know that I was a man known for my comically oversized pants.\n\n51:31.360 --> 51:33.360\nI was always tripping over my own legs.\n\n51:33.360 --> 51:37.360\nIn search of a belt, I finally found one after slaying a group of orcs.\n\n51:37.360 --> 51:39.360\nWhen I put it on, I realized that I'd become a woman.\n\n51:39.360 --> 51:41.360\nSo I killed myself.\n\n51:41.360 --> 51:42.360\nHave a nice day.\n\n51:42.360 --> 51:45.360\nDon't wear this belt unless you're into that sort of thing.\n\n51:45.360 --> 51:53.360\nSigned baggy pants ohula hand.\n\n51:53.360 --> 51:55.360\nIt's a note from Sinbag.\n\n51:55.360 --> 51:56.360\nOh my.\n\n51:56.360 --> 51:59.360\nI, I, I, I'm excited.\n\n51:59.360 --> 52:00.360\nI start to cry a little bit.\n\n52:00.360 --> 52:01.360\nI do a little dance.\n\n52:01.360 --> 52:02.360\nI, I find the belt.\n\n52:02.360 --> 52:04.360\nThe belt's around the dead woman, right?\n\n52:04.360 --> 52:05.360\nYes.\n\n52:05.360 --> 52:06.360\nI grab the belt.\n\n52:06.360 --> 52:08.360\nThat happens.\n\n52:08.360 --> 52:11.360\nI, I put the belt on.\n\n52:11.360 --> 52:13.360\nYou, you put on the belt.\n\n52:13.360 --> 52:15.360\nYou transformed into a man.\n\n52:15.360 --> 52:16.360\nWoman.\n\n52:16.360 --> 52:17.360\nWoman man.\n\n52:17.360 --> 52:18.360\nWoman.\n\n52:18.360 --> 52:19.360\nI'm back.\n\n52:19.360 --> 52:31.360\nI shake out my long, long hair.\n\n52:31.360 --> 52:34.360\nAnd I, I puff my breasts.\n\n52:34.360 --> 52:36.360\nThat's a thing, right?\n\n52:36.360 --> 52:42.360\nAre you looking to see if puffing your breasts is a thing?\n\n52:42.360 --> 52:43.360\nI left.\n\n52:43.360 --> 52:47.360\nI must, I must find Sharpie.\n\n52:47.360 --> 52:51.360\nBut first I, I fashion a dress out of leaves.\n\n52:51.360 --> 52:52.360\nThat happens.\n\n52:52.360 --> 52:58.360\nAnd I, I get on the horse and I start heading towards Sharpie.\n\n52:58.360 --> 52:59.360\nOkay.\n\n52:59.360 --> 53:01.360\nCut back to, uh, quirk.\n\n53:01.360 --> 53:03.360\nWhich store were you going for again?\n\n53:03.360 --> 53:06.360\nI was going to the door with explosions going on behind.\n\n53:06.360 --> 53:07.360\nAh.\n\n53:07.360 --> 53:08.360\nSenator.\n\n53:08.360 --> 53:09.360\nYou opened the door.\n\n53:09.360 --> 53:11.360\nThe room is long, running the length of the ship.\n\n53:11.360 --> 53:13.360\nAll cannons are lined up and outside of the ship.\n\n53:13.360 --> 53:16.360\nA few of those yellow demons, as well as one black creature,\n\n53:16.360 --> 53:18.360\nare roaming up and down the aisle.\n\n53:18.360 --> 53:20.360\nOccasionally one slithers up to a cannon,\n\n53:20.360 --> 53:23.360\nadjusts it, and fires it off with a loud explosion.\n\n53:23.360 --> 53:25.360\nThey don't regard you.\n\n53:25.360 --> 53:28.360\nAre these, are these the, um, the harpoon cannons or just regular?\n\n53:28.360 --> 53:29.360\nThese are regular cannons.\n\n53:29.360 --> 53:30.360\nRegular cannons.\n\n53:30.360 --> 53:31.360\nHmm.\n\n53:31.360 --> 53:36.360\nIs there anything beyond the, is there a door beyond those people?\n\n53:36.360 --> 53:37.360\nThere's no door.\n\n53:37.360 --> 53:39.360\nIt just leads back to the main room.\n\n53:39.360 --> 53:42.360\nCan I, I, I, I, I, I intimidate them.\n\n53:42.360 --> 53:46.360\nYou intimidate, uh, which, there's two different kinds of monsters.\n\n53:46.360 --> 53:49.360\nUh, I intimidate, uh, the, the, the, who's more threatening,\n\n53:49.360 --> 53:51.360\nthe slimy guys or the black dude?\n\n53:51.360 --> 53:52.360\nUh.\n\n53:52.360 --> 53:54.360\nI didn't mean it like that.\n\n53:54.360 --> 53:59.360\nI'd say the black, uh, creature is a bit more, uh, threatening.\n\n53:59.360 --> 54:00.360\nYeah, you would.\n\n54:00.360 --> 54:01.360\nYeah.\n\n54:01.360 --> 54:03.360\nUh, well, typical.\n\n54:03.360 --> 54:06.360\nUh, I, I, I try to intimidate the black guy.\n\n54:06.360 --> 54:11.360\nOh.\n\n54:11.360 --> 54:13.360\nWhat's your, uh, what's your intimidate bonus?\n\n54:13.360 --> 54:18.360\nUh, my intimidate, where the hell, uh, nine.\n\n54:18.360 --> 54:19.360\nYou intimidate him.\n\n54:19.360 --> 54:21.360\nHe doesn't seem to speak the same language as you,\n\n54:21.360 --> 54:22.360\nbut he cowers in fear.\n\n54:22.360 --> 54:24.360\nHe starts hissing.\n\n54:24.360 --> 54:27.360\nUh, power attack.\n\n54:27.360 --> 54:31.360\nUh, one or three, one, two, three.\n\n54:31.360 --> 54:32.360\nWhat, what's the difference?\n\n54:32.360 --> 54:33.360\nOh, you should, oh, I was saying three.\n\n54:33.360 --> 54:36.360\nThe higher the number, the less accurate, but the more damage.\n\n54:36.360 --> 54:37.360\nOkay.\n\n54:37.360 --> 54:38.360\nTwo.\n\n54:38.360 --> 54:39.360\nTwo.\n\n54:39.360 --> 54:40.360\nYeah.\n\n54:40.360 --> 54:41.360\nOh, critical hit.\n\n54:41.360 --> 54:42.360\nFuck yeah.\n\n54:42.360 --> 54:48.360\nYou're ready for this?\n\n54:48.360 --> 54:51.360\nYou slice the monster in half and it burns into pieces.\n\n54:51.360 --> 54:52.360\nAll right.\n\n54:52.360 --> 54:54.360\nWhat, what do

corridor.\n\n55:01.360 --> 55:02.360\nThat happens.\n\n55:02.360 --> 55:05.360\nI, I, I look for a door to move, to move through it.\n\n55:05.360 --> 55:06.360\nThere's no other doors.\n\n55:06.360 --> 55:08.360\nJust the one that leads back to where you came.\n\n55:08.360 --> 55:09.360\nHmm.\n\n55:09.360 --> 55:10.360\nSay what?\n\n55:10.360 --> 55:12.360\nBerserker, she wants me to go into Berserker rage.\n\n55:12.360 --> 55:13.360\nI don't even know.\n\n55:13.360 --> 55:15.360\nUh, is there any use for the, for me to use these cannons?\n\n55:15.360 --> 55:19.360\nI mean, if you want to like shoot things, maybe like on the ground.\n\n55:19.360 --> 55:20.360\nSay what?\n\n55:20.360 --> 55:21.360\nAttack the slugs.\n\n55:21.360 --> 55:26.360\nAttack the slugs, but they're not doing me any, any dirt.\n\n55:26.360 --> 55:27.360\nYeah.\n\n55:27.360 --> 55:28.360\nOkay.\n\n55:28.360 --> 55:31.360\nSo I use, I use flaming sword on one of the slimy guys.\n\n55:31.360 -->

--> 56:03.360\nYay.\n\n56:03.360 --> 56:04.360\nHi.\n\n56:04.360 --> 56:05.360\nHi.\n\n56:05.360 --> 56:06.360\nMulvane.\n\n56:06.360 --> 56:07.360\nYou're a woman.\n\n56:07.360 --> 56:08.360\nYes.\n\n56:08.360 --> 56:09.360\nI am.\n\n56:09.360 --> 56:19.360\nI shake out my hair and it's like sparkles and stars fall from my hair.\n\n56:19.360 --> 56:24.360\nI, I, I have, I have my dad's cloak now.\n\n56:24.360 --> 56:31.360\nThis is a relationship born in a horrible self-interest.\n\n56:31.360 --> 56:36.360\nI don't, I don't understand what you mean.\n\n56:36.360 --> 56:40.360\nWell, I, I, you know, I can, I can provide for you now because I can teleport and now\n\n56:40.360 --> 56:42.360\nyou have a vagina.\n\n56:42.360 --> 56:44.360\nI feel like

56:59.360\nnot as a beautiful woman that I am.\n\n56:59.360 --> 57:03.360\nSo perhaps for a little while we should just be companions.\n\n57:03.360 --> 57:04.360\nI-\n\n57:04.360 --> 57:05.360\nWhat?\n\n57:05.360 --> 57:06.360\nDungeon snap.\n\n57:06.360 --> 57:10.360\nDungeon snap?\n\n57:10.360 --> 57:12.360\nI, I haven't a side with the horse.\n\n57:12.360 --> 57:15.360\nThe

58:14.360\nWell-\n\n58:14.360 --> 58:18.360\nCan I grab your moonshot? Can I take your moonshots?\n\n58:18.360 --> 58:20.360\nYou're hitting that pretty hard, man.\n\n58:20.360 --> 58:22.360\nThis jar is like half empty.\n\n58:22.360 --> 58:29.360\nCan I grab your, can I grab your smart juice from here?\n\n58:29.360 --> 58:35.360\nYou can teleport to anything you see, maybe, or like, there's a couple places you could\n\n58:35.360 --> 58:37.360\njust go to without seeing.\n\n58:37.360 --> 58:40.360\nYou got a finesse.\n\n58:40.360 --> 58:41.360\nNot good with the magic.\n\n58:41.360 --> 58:43.360\nDo I see the Dark Star Starships?\n\n58:43.360 --> 58:44.360\nYou can see it on the horizon.\n\n58:44.360 --> 58:45.360\nAll right.\n\n58:45.360 --> 58:46.360\nIt's very far away.\n\n58:46.360 --> 58:49.360\nI can use my cloak to try to teleport to the, to, to them.\n\n58:49.360 --> 58:51.360\nCan you, I jump inside the cloak.\n\n58:51.360 --> 58:54.360\nIn a whirling flourish, you teleport.\n\n58:54.360 --> 58:56.360\nYou find yourself in a metal room.\n\n58:56.360 --> 58:58.360\nCannons light the room.\n\n58:58.360 --> 59:00.360\nBarbarian gnome stands before you.\n\n59:00.360 --> 59:01.360\nHey!\n\n59:01.360 --> 59:02.360\nI did

it.\n\n59:26.360 --> 59:30.360\nUh, meanwhile, there's a Slimey guy's firing cannons over here.\n\n59:30.360 --> 59:31.360\nA little help?\n\n59:31.360 --> 59:36.360\nI, uh, I, I take two arrows.\n\n59:36.360 --> 59:40.360\nI fire the arrows at the Slimey guys.\n\n59:40.360 --> 59:42.360\nDo you have your sheet?\n\n59:42.360 --> 59:43.360\nWhat's your attack bonus?\n\n59:43.360 --> 59:45.360\nUh, it's like a thousand.\n\n59:45.360 --> 59:46.360\nIt's like a thousand.\n\n59:46.360 --> 59:47.360\nUh, my-\n\n59:47.360 --> 59:49.360\nYou hit with both arrows.\n\n59:49.360 --> 59:50.360\nWoohoo!\n\n59:50.360 --> 59:51.360\nReally?\n\n59:51.360 --> 59:52.360\nYeah.\n\n59:52.360 --> 59:58.360\nI, guys, I hit with two arrows.\n\n59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.360\nYour arrows strike the remaining demon in the eyes.\n\n01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.360\nIt falls dead.\n\n01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.360\nI just want to.\n\n01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.360\nI just want to.\n\n01:00:03.360

sheet.\n\n01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:11.360\nIt's plus three.\n\n01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.360\nAll right.\n\n01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.360\nWe should probably stop there, right?\n\n01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.360\nCliffhanger!\n\n01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.360\nYeah.\n\n01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.360\nCliffhanger!\n\n01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.360\nCan I get those lids?\n\n01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.360\nYou okay, Dan?\n\n01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.360\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.360\nI'm fine.\n\n01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:34.360\nYou seem like you're kind of just descending into some sort of weird madness.\n\n01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:39.360\nI may be slowly going blind, uh, as they say.\n\n01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.360\nI-\n\n01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.360\nIt's Nashville.\n\n01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.360\nCan I leave yet?\n\n01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.360\nThat was awesome.\n\n01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:48.360\nThe reason why rock and roll and blues and grunge, I think, were invented here is because\n\n01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.360\nthere's no wrong answers.\n\n01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:57.360\nUh, and so we have to, we have to finish up the show with, uh, no, no, I'm sorry, I know\n\n01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.360\nwe could be here forever.\n\n01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:03.360\nWe have to, uh, holy shit, that moonshine fucked me up bad.\n\n01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.360\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.360\nIf you want, if you want your money back, I'm in back.\n\n01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:12.360\nI, I, I think, I think, uh, as drunk as you might be right now, I think now is the time\n\n01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.360\nto test your rapping abilities.\n\n01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.360\nBecause throughout-\n\n01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.360\nBecause throughout-\n\n01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.360\nCan we do, can we do one thing first?\n\n01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:21.360\nThe camera crew had, can we outfit me with the, uh, Jacques Cousteau?\n\n01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.360\nUh, uh, I want to work the crowd.\n\n01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.360\nOkay.\n\n01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.360\nOkay.\n\n01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.360\nCan we get Dan the chest GoPro camera?\n\n01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.360\nAll right.\n\n01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.360\nWe had this thing-\n\n01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.360\nRyan from our crew, everybody, is that coming up?\n\n01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.360\nUh, he's going to-\n\n01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.360\nOutfit.\n\n01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.360\nI think-\n\n01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:39.360\nWe're working the crowd lately.\n\n01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:44.360\nI think we have to, uh, Dan's worried about his rapping abilities, and they're not getting\n\n01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.360\nany stronger for some reason.\n\n01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:50.360\nUh, you'd think that as much as Dan raps about fucking people's mom is that there would\n\n01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.360\nbe some notable improvements.\n\n01:01:51.360 --> 01:02:00.360\nBut I think maybe, maybe you can harness, as you're being harnessed, literally, you could-\n\n01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.360\nOkay.\n\n01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.360\nAll right.\n\n01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:03.360\nYou can harness-\n\n01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:04.360\nI don't want to come out there.\n\n01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.360\nI'm going to work the crowd.\n\n01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.360\nAll right.\n\n01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.360\nDo you want-\n\n01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.360\nAre you going to be rapping?\n\n01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.360\nYou
