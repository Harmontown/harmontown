WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Music

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Zany's in Nashville, Tennessee.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Music

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I don't care what happens in this show, it's already been the best night of my life.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Music

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
People sat here for a good hour and a half, looks like Jim Lill were coming up and playing his heart out for us, totally amazing.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Music

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
I have very good news for each and every one of you, Harmontown is now in session.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Music

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
Music

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
He's right there.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Music

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Keep going, keep going the right way.

00:57.000 --> 01:11.000
Music

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Music city, you lost it.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Music

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Holy shit.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Wow

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
What a magical, magical day, or is it just that?

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
For my money, I could just walk off stage and go home right now.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Well, maybe not for their money.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
No.

01:29.000 --> 01:39.000
But I think, but it's noteworthy that, like, we, okay, I just, like, let's go to the timeline, because we've been sitting in the back of the room, like, hanging out with people.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
I've been doing Countless Yeager Bombs with people.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Yeah, thank you.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Is it Bob, right?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Bob and Jen, thank you.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
I'm not drunk.

01:53.000 --> 02:01.000
It's sleeting and raining and snowing, and there's ice daggers falling out of the sky, and everybody's showed up.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
The show starts at 7.30.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
We're up here at 7.25 on the nugget, or something like that.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
We've been back there since 6.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
I don't know how the timing of it works, but it's like, oh, get them in here, get them in here.

02:16.000 --> 02:25.000
I don't know why everybody showed up early, but get them in, get them in, warm them up, light a fire.

02:25.000 --> 02:36.000
And then, but then, because we're making this movie, like, one of the weird byproducts of making a documentary is, okay, you can't be playing Prince songs while everyone's sitting around having a good time.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
So, yeah, exactly.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
It's a shitty corporate, it's one of the many little invisible ways that corporate America fucks you over.

02:44.000 --> 02:52.000
Like, like, like, oh god, oh, Wang Chung can't be playing while I'm waiting an hour for the shit I bought a ticket to.

02:52.000 --> 03:01.000
And so, you would be sitting here in abject silence, but we're in Nashville, Jeff, where music was invented three times over.

03:01.000 --> 03:09.000
The blues was invented here, rock and roll was invented here, and grunge was then invented here.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Is that true?

03:11.000 --> 03:22.000
Yes, it was in this very bar that Weezers, their van broke down and they said, you know what, let's just, let's just not get dressed up tonight.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah, let's wear a checkered shirt and not wash our hair.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
At a club called The Ironic Old Opry.

03:29.000 --> 03:38.000
Country western, blues, rock and roll, everything, everything that calls itself music, purportedly originated from this fertile crescent in the south.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
Also, Martin Luther King got shot somewhere in the state.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Don't worry about it, not holding you to that.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
We're more focused on the Elvis thing, love you, love you for it.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
No biggie, it's all about balance.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
It's all about perpetuation of cultural infamy.

03:58.000 --> 04:07.000
But only in this state, only in Nashville, only in this city, could you come in with no music to play when people are sitting and then go,

04:07.000 --> 04:18.000
hey, anybody able to fill an hour with a guitar and one guy's like, yeah, I got a guitar in my wallet?

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
What's his name, Joe Lill? Jim Lill.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
Joe is Southernford, Jim.

04:25.000 --> 04:39.000
Jim Lill, this kid, this little child with his acoustic sick stream came up here and filled like an hour of time while we did younger bombs in the back.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
He sang songs that he dedicated to Joseph Campbell.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
He sang the community theme at the end.

04:46.000 --> 04:57.000
He strummed and he hummed and he thumped and he bumped and he's the John Henry of legally clearable music.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
This is the city to be in if you need music.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
Also, we've been working on this Harmontown theme, so we'll probably be bringing people up.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
I think there's probably some singers in the audience.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
It's Nashville. Don't shake your head, lady.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
I just want to put this out.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
I assume there's somebody who can do a mean beatbox in the audience.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I expected a bigger reaction than that.

05:28.000 --> 05:36.000
Maybe not. Maybe Nashville rejects the beatbox as a valid musical instrument.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
You do?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Oh, I do. Thank you.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
What was your name again?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Garrett.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Can you stand up and face everybody?

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
Is this going to accumulate if I say Neil Patrick Harris?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
You probably get that a lot.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
It's nerd on nerd violence.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I shouldn't be doing it.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Who do you get, Dan?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Do people say you look like somebody?

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Randy Quaid.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
I get Randy Quaid.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
I want to get Bill Murray so bad.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
I just make people.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Bill Murray, sometimes people say Bill Murray.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
No one ever says Bill Murray.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
What are your neighbors, like the Armenian woman?

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
She always said I look like Russell Crowe.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
I miss that so much.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
She didn't know Russell Crowe's name.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I would always have to tell her.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Who do you look like?

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
He was a gladiator.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Russell Crowe, yeah, that's it.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Now I don't.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Shut up.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Music City, Jeff. Music City.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
A couple other nicknames for this town.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
The Athens of the South.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
A lot of schools, museums and whatever.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Just a lot of columns and things.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I don't know why. Athens of the South.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
I don't get it either.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Little Kurdistan.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
No one calls it that.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Little Wikipedia.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Do we have any Kurds in the crowd tonight?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Any Kurds here?

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Wikipedia would have you wrong.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Supposedly there's the largest U.S. population of Kurds in Nashville.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Do they just hate me?

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
I was going to do a whole thing where I...

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
I made a bookmark on my phone for Kurdistan.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
So I was going to try to riff like a...

07:36.000 --> 07:43.000
A Kurd targeting stand-up act.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
You've been to Kurdistan? Neopatic Harris?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
What's your actual name?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Gary.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
You've been to Kurdistan under what circumstances?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
You were in the Army.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
What was your MOS?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
What the hell does that mean?

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
A 21 Bravo? What is that?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Combat engineer.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
What are you talking about?

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
What are you guys doing? What's going on here?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Do you ever scream, scrub a double walnut?

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
No, that's not real. That's not real language.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I made that up.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
What does that actually mean?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
No one seems to know the answer to that.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Military occupational specialty.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Military occupational specialty.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
You were a combat engineer.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Does that mean you blew up bridges and stuff like that?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
I thought it sounded like a recruiter.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
What did you actually do?

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Well, we actually blew up a lot of artillery shells.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
That's like blowing up unused artillery and stuff?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Yeah, yeah, it's all over the country.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Were you in Iraq?

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Yeah.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Really? How long did you serve?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I was in Iraq for three years.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Let's hear your yell.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Who? Who?

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
He had a slightly honorable discharge.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
You are amazing out here,

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
but you cannot be relied upon to selling alpachino.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
And while that does not win or lose wars,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
we have to let you go.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Yeah, he did arrive.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Imagine.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Who is your army?

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
What's your rank? Are you retired?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I was separated.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Separated?

09:24.000 --> 09:31.000
Just wanted to start seeing other branches of the military.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
No branches.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
You're just done.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Yeah, that's a rough gig, man.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
You were out in Iraq when things were hairy?

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
It's like a lot of dullness and then a few hairy hours.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
It's like incredibly dull, broken up, and really hairy.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Just one of those dull afternoons when you're blowing up artillery

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
and stuff like that?

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
I saw the Hurt Locker, so I think I know exactly.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
I might as well have been there.

10:00.000 --> 10:07.000
I think hairy weather is half of the capital to make a lot of money.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
People grab around Iraq and some of these call about themselves all the time.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Yeah, that's what you do.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Take a nice stroll.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
What's the worst thing that can happen?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
That sounds like such a bummer.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
I get Facebook messages from guys that were active service out there.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
They go, I love community.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
I'm out here.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
I'm in this station and that station.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
I'm doing this and that.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
I write back to them and go, you fucking stay safe.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Will you just stay safe?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Just get back home.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
I don't know if that's the right response because they never write back.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
I don't know if it's because they're like, don't be an asshole.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Tell me who I am.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
I don't know.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
They're like, get back here, you fucker.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
My ratings are so low.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
They go, what are you doing out there?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
You watch my show?

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
That's the consolidation of the forces.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
That's the limit that you support the troops is to the extent that they have a Nielsen box.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
What are you doing?

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
Nashville, Jeff, name for Francis Nash.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
You know who Francis Nash is.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Yeah, I know, but today.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
He invented the typewriter.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
No, he didn't.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I couldn't forget Francis Nash.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Are there any Francis Nash experts in the audience?

11:26.000 --> 11:33.000
Because the city's named, there's a lot of things in the South named after Francis Nash.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
He was kind of a weird character.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
I couldn't really get a line on it.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
I Wikipedia at Nashville and then I was like, who's this Francis Nash guy?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
He's a good guy or a bad guy.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
And I couldn't really figure it out.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
So I was wondering if there was anybody here.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Dan, I hate to interrupt this trenchant commentary on Nashville,

11:50.000 --> 11:57.000
but is there an audience member wearing one of our GoPro cameras on his head down in the front?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Yes, there is.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Love it.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
So our asshole director just came and put a camera on your head.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
He didn't even ask.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
You're going to get lots of awesome shots of Dan's balls during this.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
In addition to the two cameras.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
The city's sometimes called the buckle of the Bible Belt.

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
I would figure my audience wouldn't approve of that, but I think that's mythologically important.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
But they have the power to unbuckle it.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Yeah, exactly.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Don't deny that power.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
All you have to do is go, ugh, and the South's pants fall down.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
The whole country changes.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
But you can't deny the fact.

12:46.000 --> 12:56.000
I think honestly, we were in Atlanta and I really went to town on how politically or historically important it was that we were in Atlanta.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
I was super charged there.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Here it could get a little uncomfortable talking about that.

13:00.000 --> 13:08.000
Nashville, what eclipses it is that throughout the decades, no matter what comes along musically, Nashville just like, what is it?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
What is it, Jeff?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Why do they love music so much?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
What's with them?

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
I love country music, but I like old country music.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
I don't really like the new, what they call the Nashville sound, right?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
It's too overproduced for me.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
As Waylon Jennings called it, he goes, it's flat belly country.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Country musicians should have a pot belly.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
He doesn't like any guy that sings country and has abs.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
I think that's a good barometer to go by.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
This is where Garth Brooks invented the wire work, right?

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
If I were to float above the audience, I remember having a big fight with my mom about Garth Brooks.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
It's not important.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
It sounds pretty important.

13:52.000 --> 14:01.000
Because my mom, when I was growing up, she loved country music and then I was like, oh, that Garth Brooks, he knows where it's at because he flies over the audience on a wire.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
And my mom was like, you know, he's an asshole.

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
And I was like, fuck you, because I was really offended because I was starting to get into country music because Garth Brooks flew over it.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
That's why I said I didn't want to talk about it.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
I'm just going to cry.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
I thought you would not be on the Garth Brooks side.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
I had no idea.

14:21.000 --> 14:29.000
I was trying to, I mean, I'm on the arguing with my mom, so no matter what, I'm 40 years old, I'll still have any excuse to fight with my mom.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
I was just like, oh, Garth Brooks, he's cool.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I thought it would make her like me.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
And then she was like, I don't like Garth Brooks.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
And I was like, dude, I can't do anything right.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
It doesn't matter.

14:42.000 --> 14:52.000
I've been through Nashville, but tonight, the show is kind of early, we get to go out, and I've been told I need to go out and hang out on Broadway and go to some Honky Tonk bars.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
That's what I want to do.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
No?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Huh?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
A coyote ugly?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Okay, I take it back.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
I take it back.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
I went to a coyote ugly, Dan, on Thanksgiving a few years ago in New York, and not on purpose.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
I was with a friend, and it was Thanksgiving night, and I was with my friend Vanessa.

15:08.000 --> 15:15.000
And we were walking around the Lower East Side East Village, and we were trying to find a bar to go into on Thanksgiving.

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
And I was really overdressed, and she went to a fancy restaurant, and we were just trying to find a nice bar to drink in.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
But everything was either closed, or you walked in, and it was so depressing because it was Thanksgiving.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
And it was just people crying into their beers.

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
Or there are bars where people are really trying to pretend that they weren't sad, that they weren't with their families.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
And it was really overcompensating, and it was just too much douchebaggery for one bar to contain.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
And so I said, it was freezing out.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Not as snow as falling.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
And we're like, look, whatever the next bar is, good, bad, or indifferent, we're going into that bar.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
And we see a sign up ahead.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
We can see some neon.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
We're going to that bar, and a block away, she stops me.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
She goes, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
I'm like, no, we said, we made a deal.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
We're going into that bar, and she goes, that bar is coyote ugly.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
I'm like, fuck it, we're going in.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
So we go into the coyote ugly.

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
There's nobody there except three Korean gentlemen who are really, really trying to just dig it.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
They're hitting numbers at random on the jukebox.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
And like a George Strait song that George Strait doesn't like comes on.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
He's ill-fated.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
I stole my toe.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I stole my toe.

16:24.000 --> 16:31.000
I go to the bar, and now when someone plays the songs that they are required by law, these two poor women that are kind of sexy,

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
take it up on the bar and joylessly dance around for you.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
And it's really like, don't do this for me.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
Like, whatever they're paying you, I'll double it.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
And I had this really nice tie on, this Vivian Westwood tie.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
And this woman, this young girl who's the bartender, I found that she's from Columbia,

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
and she was just hot as a Colombian lunch, very sexy.

16:52.000 --> 16:59.000
And she jumps up on the bar, pours a shot, pours Cuervo tequila into her mouth,

16:59.000 --> 17:07.000
grabs me, squats down from on top of the bar, grabs my head, and spits a mouthful of Cuervo into my mouth.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
And I was like, swallow the barf.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
And then she takes some scissors out and grabs my brand new Vivian Westwood tie

17:15.000 --> 17:23.000
and starts to come at my tie, and I grab her hand like Robert De Niro in Awakenings.

17:23.000 --> 17:30.000
And I can't, she's like, you can't wear a fucking tie in here.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
You can't like, wear a fucking tie.

17:34.000 --> 17:41.000
And it was that offensive an impression that she was doing of her homeland.

17:41.000 --> 17:47.000
And I grabbed her and I thought on my feet and I said, well, my father gave me this in his deathbed.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
He said, my dad's not dead. My dad is not dead. I bought that tie.

17:50.000 --> 17:56.000
And she's like, okay, and she's like, well, take it off and put it in your pocket.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
Because the corporation that owns this bar told me I had to cut it off and hit it in the water.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
That's a gimmick.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
There are cameras everywhere. My family is in the back duct tape defaulting chairs.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
You have no idea how important this is to me.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Wasn't there a TV show called Coyote Ugly?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Isn't that a good sign?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
A movie.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Yeah, okay.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Yeah, good sign that nothing.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Piper Carabou, whatever her name was wasn't a thing.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Jeff, I just noticed these people while you were telling a story.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah, she got all the drink orders wrong and it was the worst, but then we ended up having fun because it was so bizarre.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I'm doing the rest of the show this direction.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
I don't know what you guys paid, but this doesn't seem fair.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
What have we done so far that you didn't want...

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Oh, uh...

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
There's a civil war happening in Mexico.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Fuck these stage-right audience.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
My podium is awesomely made of plexiglass, so there's perfect crotch action for these people right here.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Ladies?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Hey, Jeff.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Yes, Dan?

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
I talked to a guy back there while we were doing Edgar Bombs.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
A authentic Nashvillian.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Yeah?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
A guy named Josh.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
He brought Moonshine with him.

19:12.000 --> 19:18.000
And I've never had Moonshine and I thought he could come up and give me a taste of Moonshine on stage.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
That sounds awesomely illegal. Let's bring him up.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Josh, everybody!

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
It's one of the many, many hilarious gimmicks we can do here.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
Okay, so a guy is coming up right now.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
He looks like Dan Harmon's younger brother.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
And he has a brown paper bag that goes on his stage, Josh.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Okay, that corrects something real quick.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
I'm not an authentic Nashvillian.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I'm from Knoxville, but...

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Hey, hey, hey!

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Boo!

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Boo!

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
I'm representing the hill people who make the Moonshine, so...

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
It comes in a jar.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
You have to drink it out of the jar.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Alright, I'm drinking it out of the jar.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Wait, is this...

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
This is labeled. This is like...

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
I don't have a direct connection to the hill people, so I had to do what I could.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Are you a hill person?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
No.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
But I feel like I can represent them.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
That's good, I appreciate that.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Okay, the Mason jar is being cracked open.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Alright.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Or potentially.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Can we get a lady up to listen to us for him?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
There we are, we got it.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Well, let's go to the brim.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
There you go.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Yeah, we learned a little bit of it.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Do I drink the whole jar?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
No, no, no, no.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
No, you...

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
That'll be a very different time and time.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
Well, I'm proud to be from Nashville

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
In the birth of the music scene

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
I'm drinking white latin thunder

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
And you know my mother knows what you mean

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
I got a Elvis on the lip set

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Got some Beatles on the right

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
I'm gonna go and do a southern thing tonight

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
I got a moonshine and a wake warm wiggie

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
Whoop whoop, David Duke, David

21:19.000 --> 21:29.000
I'm Dan Harmon doing the southern thing

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Oh, shit.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
That tastes like...

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
What does it taste like?

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
That tastes like a...

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
It's probably watered down.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Trambulli or...

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
No, it's like...

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
You know what it tastes like?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
And I don't mean...

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
It tastes like grappa.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I think that's Italian moonshine.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
It's really nice.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
It's hill grappa.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
It tastes like a fight with my girlfriend.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
It tastes like tonight Aaron and I are gonna have a fight.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
No, you could probably run your car on this.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
What is the proof on this thing, you know?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
40, 50%.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
100 proof.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
Why is there a barcode?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
It's called Old Smoky.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Old Smoky Tennessee Moonshine.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
It's quite good from Gatlinburg, Tennessee.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
I kind of...

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
It's good.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
The second sip tastes better than the third.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Yeah.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Wait, I mean...

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
And then time pulled it in on itself.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Oh, boy.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
Okay, well, you drink it from a jar and...

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Yeah.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
Thank you, Josh.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Nashville.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I love it.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
This is the best.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
I think all shows should start with us at the bar, with the crowd,

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
with a local busker up here laying down the jams,

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
and a dude comes up and just gives us booze.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Yeah.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
I don't know if they'd agree.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I mean, we were thinking back there,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
like, let's start the show just earlier,

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
but then, like, we didn't know if anyone was gonna show up

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
at the appropriate time.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
Then they'd come in and we'd be doing, like, a raffle.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
I feel like we should get Jim Lill up here at some point

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
and have a guitar maybe improvise.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
I should.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Here's what I want to do in Nashville.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Like, if we do nothing else,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
because it's music sitting USA,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I'm sorry I'm gonna be burping.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Are you okay?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Moonshine.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
You know a comic died here in 1983, the year it opened.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
I was talking to the owner.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
It was not moonshine-related.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
No, that was...

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
That was 1983-related.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
Guess what he was on.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.000
It was probably a lot of things.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
Yeah, we definitely gotta get the guitar up

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
and we're gonna get some Rihanna's and some Tidos up here.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
Tennessee, last state to leave the Union?

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
When the Civil War conflict happened?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Or, I'm sorry, aggression of the North?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
What do you call it?

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
The War of North and Aggression.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
The War of the North being an asshole.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
First state to be readmitted.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
I think that's very interesting.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
Tennessee, last one out, first one back in.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
Just a quick, like, fuck it, fuck it.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I think that's very interesting.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Which way is the wind blowing? North?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
I support that.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
I think that makes this state my...

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
We were in Georgia and it was like,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
holy shit, these guys, they got the brunt of it,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
but I like the idea of a state that was like,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
is there a war? Is there a war?

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
Okay, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Not like the French in World War II,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
not like your pussies,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
but more like your practical.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Like, what the fuck was that war about?

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
We don't even know.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Still trying to figure it out.

24:49.000 --> 24:56.000
I'm pouring myself a moonshine rocks.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I can tell you a little...

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I don't know if this will be entertaining to people,

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
because I'm three sips of moonshine in.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Thank you, Mandy.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
At the hotel on the elevator,

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
the elevator opened up and there was a guy.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
He worked for the hotel.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
He was going down.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
He didn't need to get off on the floor

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
that we were getting off on,

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
but he had a big luggage rack full of paint,

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
supplies and shit,

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
and Aaron and I were going down.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
We were trying to squeeze in and he's like,

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
you know what, let me get off

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
and so you guys can get on.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
I'll take the next elevator.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
The elevator door closed and Aaron and I were sitting in the elevator

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
and Aaron referencing the guy that just did that went,

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
huh, that's what they call Nashville-style.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
And I said, I think you mean Southern hospitality.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
And she said, no, no, it's Nashville-style.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
I knew it wasn't funny.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I thought it was really funny

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
because I was thinking in my head,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
that's the Southern hospitality.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Nashville-style, she made up a new thing.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Sorry.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Is there a Nashville-style?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I'm sure there is.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
I'm sure it has nothing to do with the elevators.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Yes, we've gone to, so far,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Phoenix, no, no one's proud of being from Phoenix.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
I'll erase that one.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
But Atlanta and Austin that we've been to,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
people very, very proud of being from those cities.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
You guys are all pretty proud of being from Nashville too, right?

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
No?

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Okay, I take it back.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
You guys hate Nashville.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Jeff, there's always going to be a swirl

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
of weird reactions to that shit

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
because people have this need to go,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
like, fuck the,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
and I support you.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Like, whatever you think

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
coming into our carnival town,

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
you know, fuck what you think.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
No, I'm different.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I'm different.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
We're cosmopolitan.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
I think they cry out

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
for individuality.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Mandy cries out for moonshine.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
No.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
You and I are not going to go into a single town where we go,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
hey, Nashville, you love

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
tires, right?

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
And everyone goes like, we love tires.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
There's always somebody who's going to go like,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
we don't love tires that much, fuck you.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Like, we're human beings.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
We don't represent tires.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
We're in Music City, USA.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
I don't know if I've said that enough.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
You have said that.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Also knows the Paris of Georgia.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Whatever the fuck.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Jeff,

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
the Pringles Dick song.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Yes.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I wanted to get Jim

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Lil.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Yeah, but does he know it?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
He doesn't know the song.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Jim, do you know the Pringles Dick song?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Get your guitar up here.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
I'll get my ukulele from backstage.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
We'll learn it together.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
This is in preparation of

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
we want to leave

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Nashville with a superior version

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
of the Harmontown theme.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Want to do some practicing.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Jeff's got his ukulele.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
We'll get this kid here.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
Back to the stage, everybody.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Does anybody know the Pringles Dick song?

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I don't know if anybody from the podcast.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Probably not.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
It's a song I wrote.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
It's about

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
on a tour bus and you have Pringles

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
and you hold them in your lap.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Like it's your dick.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
It goes like this.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
I think it's in D.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
It goes D, G,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
A7.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I think there's like a B flat in there somewhere.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
It's like cleaner.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Then it goes like this.

28:55.000 --> 29:15.000
I got it.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Alright, I think I got that.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
What tempo should we do it in?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Do you want to keep it stylish?

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Should we make it move a little bit?

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Let's make this sucker move.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Let's do this in a Nashville style.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
It's a thing. It's a thing now.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Nashville style.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Oh, some people call me Pringles Dick

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
But I never really found out why

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
I don't really have a Pringles Dick

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
I just keep my dick inside

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I keep my dick inside a Pringles can

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Because it keeps my penis safe and dry

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Some people call me Pringles Dick

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
But I never really found out

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
No, I never found out

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
I never really found out why

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Yo, yo, yo

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Potato chips on my dick

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I want to put my dick inside a stick

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
A can on my hand

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I don't want to do it well

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
I thought I'd do a rap bridge

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
But I'm doing badly

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I'll make it mouth noises

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Sorry, I got cocky

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
You guys are having fun

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Some people call me Pringles Dick

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
But I never really found out why

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
I won't do it again

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I don't really have a Pringles Dick

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
I just keep my dick inside

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
So sorry about what I did

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
I keep my dick inside a Pringles can

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Because it keeps my penis safe and dry

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Yo, yo

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Some people call me Pringles Dick

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
But I never really found out

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
No, I never really found out why

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Yo, yo, yo

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Oh, sorry

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Sorry

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Sorry

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Stay up here, Jim, Park it

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Will you stay here?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Because we already

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
We've got this theme song developing

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Is it time to bring up

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Some female vocalists

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Do we have any more microphones back there?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
We have Spencer's microphones

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Do we have 50 more microphones?

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
I was introduced

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
A girl came up and she said her friend wants to sing

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Is Ashley out there right now?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Ashley

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
You've been out here by your friend

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Was it Melissa?

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Yeah, Melissa has

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
She volunteered you

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Alright, Ashley everybody

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Here's your microphone

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Hello

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Ashley, have you heard the song?

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Have you been following the podcast?

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Is this the penis one?

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Probably

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
What podcast do you listen to?

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
If you have a penis song

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
No, no, if you mean Pringles Dickman

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
No, our song about Harmontown

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
And Pee and Pooh, have you heard that song?

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
No, but I will collaborate

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Here we go, we'll play it

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
So we can get you up to speed

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Give me a little primer

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
You can't just say syllables

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Yo, there it goes again

32:35.000 --> 32:41.000
Come on down to Harmontown, turn your frown upside down

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
Pree is yellow, poop is brown

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Come on down to Harmontown

32:47.000 --> 32:53.000
Come on down to Harmontown, turn your frown upside down

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
Pee is yellow, pooh is brown

32:57.000 --> 32:59.140
Come on down to, Harmon take it

32:59.140 --> 33:05.140
Come on down to Harmontown, my poop is brown.

33:08.140 --> 33:10.140
Overqualified, overqualified.

33:15.140 --> 33:18.140
Make up your own words again, because we're getting tired.

33:18.140 --> 33:20.140
We've become tired of our own words now.

33:20.140 --> 33:22.140
So if you want to just freestyle, here we go.

33:22.140 --> 33:29.140
Come on down to Harmontown, taking your brown upside down.

33:31.140 --> 33:32.140
Sorry.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.140
That's alright.

33:34.140 --> 33:35.140
You guys write the joke.

33:35.140 --> 33:36.140
I'll just sing Harmontown.

33:36.140 --> 33:40.140
So Jamercites, it's E minor, C, G, D, I think.

33:42.140 --> 33:47.140
Come on down to Harmontown, turn that brown upside down.

33:47.140 --> 33:53.140
P is yellow, poop is brown, come on down to Harmontown.

33:53.140 --> 33:54.140
You guys are some of the best song writers.

33:54.140 --> 33:55.140
I've already asked for it.

33:56.140 --> 33:58.140
I've done myself on this one.

33:58.140 --> 33:59.140
I won an Emmy for it.

34:05.140 --> 34:11.140
Come on down to Harmontown, turn that brown upside down.

34:11.140 --> 34:17.140
P is yellow, poop is brown, come on down to Harmontown.

34:17.140 --> 34:19.140
Soft shakers on the table.

34:19.140 --> 34:21.140
I hope I'm rapping.

34:21.140 --> 34:22.140
I hope I'm able.

34:22.140 --> 34:25.140
I'm in a club called Sadie's in Nashville.

34:25.140 --> 34:29.140
I hope I can use the whole Tinker Price film.

34:29.140 --> 34:31.140
I hope I can get them able to give me something.

34:31.140 --> 34:34.140
Well, she's doing it at the same time as I'm rapping.

34:34.140 --> 34:36.140
That's so confusing.

34:36.140 --> 34:37.140
It's so weird.

34:37.140 --> 34:41.140
It's happening at the same time as my beard.

34:41.140 --> 34:45.140
Come on down to Harmontown, turn that brown upside down.

34:45.140 --> 34:48.140
Come on down to Harmontown, turn that brown upside down.

34:48.140 --> 34:49.140
It's weird.

34:49.140 --> 34:52.140
Come on down to Harmontown, turn that brown upside down.

34:52.140 --> 34:53.140
I'm going to hang back.

34:53.140 --> 34:54.140
I'm going to...

34:54.140 --> 34:55.140
All right.

34:55.140 --> 34:56.140
Okay.

34:56.140 --> 34:57.140
All right.

34:57.140 --> 34:58.140
Okay.

34:58.140 --> 34:59.140
Yeah.

34:59.140 --> 35:00.140
Bravo.

35:01.140 --> 35:05.140
Ashley, we opened in three nights.

35:05.140 --> 35:07.140
All right.

35:07.140 --> 35:11.140
And there's not a single person in Nashville that can do percussion.

35:11.140 --> 35:12.140
Oh, Josh.

35:12.140 --> 35:13.140
Wow.

35:13.140 --> 35:15.140
Josh.

35:15.140 --> 35:16.140
Josh.

35:16.140 --> 35:19.140
Preveyor of corn squeezes and percussion.

35:19.140 --> 35:20.140
Dan, are you okay?

35:20.140 --> 35:21.140
Yeah.

35:21.140 --> 35:24.140
You're hanging by a thread over there.

35:24.140 --> 35:26.140
I've never seen you like this, man.

35:26.140 --> 35:30.140
Give me one more sip of the...

35:30.140 --> 35:33.140
Now, Ashley and Jim and Josh, we're going to send you back.

35:33.140 --> 35:35.140
We're going to bring you back up later on for the...

35:35.140 --> 35:36.140
For the finale.

35:36.140 --> 35:37.140
Yeah, for the reprise.

35:37.140 --> 35:38.140
All right.

35:38.140 --> 35:39.140
We'll start practicing.

35:39.140 --> 35:40.140
All right.

35:40.140 --> 35:41.140
Good.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.140
Yeah.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.140
Yeah.

35:43.140 --> 35:44.140
Going back and make the G chord match to the C chord.

35:44.140 --> 35:45.140
No, that's Nashville.

35:45.140 --> 35:47.140
No, that's exactly how it works.

35:47.140 --> 35:48.140
Yeah.

35:48.140 --> 35:49.140
Absolutely.

35:49.140 --> 35:50.140
No.

35:50.140 --> 35:55.140
Josh, Jim, Tracy, Morgan.

35:55.140 --> 35:57.140
Tracy Morgan was there?

35:57.140 --> 35:58.140
All right.

35:58.140 --> 36:02.140
I suppose now it's time to bring up our Dungeon Master Spencer Crittenden.

36:02.140 --> 36:09.140
Oh, shit.

36:09.140 --> 36:14.140
Oh, shit.

36:14.140 --> 36:18.140
Oh, shit.

36:18.140 --> 36:20.140
Oh, shit.

36:20.140 --> 36:22.140
Microphone.

36:22.140 --> 36:29.140
That's, that's accurate.

36:29.140 --> 36:37.140
Nashville.

36:37.140 --> 36:38.140
Thank God.

36:38.140 --> 36:39.140
How are you doing, Spencer?

36:39.140 --> 36:40.140
We're starting to keep you waiting so long, man.

36:40.140 --> 36:41.140
What's up?

36:41.140 --> 36:42.140
Oh, no, it's all good.

36:42.140 --> 36:47.140
I was, I was just in the back there.

36:47.140 --> 36:50.140
You're sharpening your dice?

36:50.140 --> 36:52.140
You soak them in alcohol.

36:52.140 --> 36:53.140
Is that true?

36:53.140 --> 36:54.140
Yeah.

36:54.140 --> 36:57.140
It appeases the, the God's of luck.

36:57.140 --> 37:01.140
Well, I've soaked, I've been soaking myself in alcohol and I'm very appeased.

37:01.140 --> 37:04.140
Well, I can't roll you too easily, but let's see.

37:04.140 --> 37:05.140
Do you want some moonshine?

37:05.140 --> 37:06.140
Do you drink?

37:06.140 --> 37:08.140
This is bad, bad.

37:08.140 --> 37:09.140
Spencer, have some moonshine.

37:09.140 --> 37:10.140
You can't have two.

37:10.140 --> 37:12.140
We're in Nashville.

37:12.140 --> 37:17.140
Because now Spencer, Spencer on the road is, he's a huge fan of Mountain Dew.

37:17.140 --> 37:20.140
Mountain Dew is originally a slang term for moonshine.

37:20.140 --> 37:21.140
Yeah.

37:21.140 --> 37:23.140
Because they made it, they made it by the moonlight.

37:23.140 --> 37:27.140
Yeah, I don't know what to do with a thing.

37:27.140 --> 37:29.140
So this is some real Mountain Dew.

37:29.140 --> 37:32.140
If I vomit, you guys, don't hold it against me.

37:32.140 --> 37:34.140
I never will.

37:34.140 --> 37:39.140
I'll slather myself in it.

37:39.140 --> 37:43.140
My lips are numb.

37:43.140 --> 37:45.140
He announced it.

37:45.140 --> 37:47.140
This is a tour of firsts.

37:47.140 --> 37:52.140
We certainly are the first comedy tour I think to travel on a tour bus with our own Dungeon Master.

37:52.140 --> 37:58.140
Almost certainly we're the first show to have a Dungeon Master drink moonshine before mastering a dungeon.

37:58.140 --> 38:01.140
So this is probably the last.

38:01.140 --> 38:04.140
All right, do you want to dispense our character sheets there?

38:04.140 --> 38:06.140
Yeah, we're going to need Erin up here then.

38:06.140 --> 38:09.140
Let's bring up Erin McGathy.

38:09.140 --> 38:12.140
Erin McGathy, dance girlfriend, Mulrainee Sidhanna.

38:12.140 --> 38:19.140
Erin everyone.

38:19.140 --> 38:25.140
I love your Nashville style.

38:25.140 --> 38:29.140
How would you define Nashville style?

38:29.140 --> 38:31.140
Kindness from strangers.

38:31.140 --> 38:37.140
It's kind of hospitality in a, not North region, but like below it.

38:37.140 --> 38:38.140
Nashville style.

38:38.140 --> 38:40.140
Can I get some of that moonshine?

38:40.140 --> 38:42.140
Yeah, absolutely.

38:42.140 --> 38:46.140
I want to commit to this fight that we're having later.

38:46.140 --> 38:47.140
What should we fight about?

38:47.140 --> 38:50.140
I feel like I drink a tree.

38:50.140 --> 38:52.140
It just feels like drinking a tree.

38:52.140 --> 38:53.140
It's really good.

38:53.140 --> 38:54.140
It's so good.

38:54.140 --> 38:57.140
And you know, drinking too much makes Spencer sick.

38:57.140 --> 39:00.140
Yeah, that's why I said the vomit thing.

39:00.140 --> 39:03.140
I just want to be cool, you guys.

39:03.140 --> 39:06.140
Spencer, you're in safe surroundings.

39:06.140 --> 39:13.140
We'll take very good care of you unless that guy poisons everyone.

39:13.140 --> 39:14.140
I think it takes five.

39:14.140 --> 39:16.140
It's like water.

39:16.140 --> 39:17.140
It tastes like water.

39:17.140 --> 39:21.140
No, it doesn't.

39:21.140 --> 39:24.140
I always drink my water from under the sink.

39:24.140 --> 39:26.140
Who's got the lip?

39:26.140 --> 39:27.140
I got it.

39:27.140 --> 39:28.140
Can I?

39:28.140 --> 39:29.140
Yeah.

39:29.140 --> 39:32.140
We're all going to fuck tonight, you guys.

39:32.140 --> 39:37.140
Spencer, if you would, get us up to date.

39:37.140 --> 39:42.140
Last time, Sharpie and Court parted ways with Mulrainee, the half elf.

39:42.140 --> 39:48.140
The ranger had some business to attend to elsewhere with arrows and possibly magic belts to locate.

39:48.140 --> 39:55.140
The duo pressed onwards, hoping to arrive in time to assist Mango against the threat of Admiral Darkstar's Dark Armada.

39:55.140 --> 40:03.140
Arriving at the scene of a great battle, the heroes watched in horror as legions of cylindrical constructs pushed back the barbarian horde.

40:03.140 --> 40:06.140
The cylinders seemed to be pressing towards a great excavation site.

40:06.140 --> 40:15.140
A huge pit are in the ground near the yellow camp. In a moment of clarity or madness, Sharpie leapt into action and hurled Quark at one of the floating cylinders.

40:15.140 --> 40:24.140
Clinging on for dear life, Quark could only watch in confusion as the swarm of cylinders descended into the pit, retrieving a massive golem.

40:24.140 --> 40:28.140
A flying ship reeled it in and then flew away with Quark in tow.

40:28.140 --> 40:31.140
The cylindrical army retreated to the ship.

40:31.140 --> 40:35.140
The ship sailed north. The group was split.

40:35.140 --> 40:39.140
I don't know if you heard that podcast.

40:39.140 --> 40:49.140
I reluctantly clung onto a flying cylinder and boarded a giant spaceship, which is presumably Admiral Darkstar's mother ship.

40:49.140 --> 40:51.140
Perhaps.

40:51.140 --> 40:55.140
I'm separated from Sharpie and Mulraine for the first time.

40:55.140 --> 40:59.140
I should mention that your healing pendant has brought you back to full health.

40:59.140 --> 41:01.140
So I'm back to 40 hit points?

41:01.140 --> 41:06.140
Yeah. 40 hit points, motherfucker!

41:06.140 --> 41:12.140
HIT POINTS!

41:12.140 --> 41:14.140
40 hit points.

41:14.140 --> 41:17.140
No, not me.

41:17.140 --> 41:20.140
I'm sorry, it's the moonshine. I'm sorry.

41:20.140 --> 41:23.140
Oh boy, I love hit points.

41:23.140 --> 41:25.140
Okay, sorry.

41:25.140 --> 41:27.140
Do I go first or what?

41:27.140 --> 41:30.140
If you want to decide for yourselves or I could roll randomly.

41:30.140 --> 41:32.140
I'll decide to go first.

41:32.140 --> 41:33.140
Alright.

41:33.140 --> 41:35.140
I examine my new strange surroundings.

41:35.140 --> 41:41.140
Hanging on for dear life on the Candroid, you watch as a line of the constructs flies back into the ship.

41:41.140 --> 41:44.140
The room you're now inside of is large, full of metal racks.

41:44.140 --> 41:49.140
Several circular hatches on the floor look as if they exit out from the bottom of the ship.

41:49.140 --> 41:55.140
The Candroids float onto metal racks before settling down into place with light clunks.

41:55.140 --> 41:59.140
You can hear the hum of large machinery coming from all around you.

41:59.140 --> 42:04.140
Awww.

42:04.140 --> 42:06.140
Um.

42:06.140 --> 42:09.140
So are there any doors in the room I'm in?

42:09.140 --> 42:12.140
You can see a large metal door opposite the hatch you came in on.

42:12.140 --> 42:15.140
Above you is a metal lavator leading to a hatch in the ceiling.

42:15.140 --> 42:17.140
I climb the ladder.

42:17.140 --> 42:19.140
You climb the ladder?

42:19.140 --> 42:20.140
Thank you.

42:20.140 --> 42:23.140
Now you're at the hatch. It is closed.

42:23.140 --> 42:26.140
I use all my barbarian strength to open the hatch.

42:26.140 --> 42:29.480
You use all of your barbarian str- No, it just opens.

42:29.480 --> 42:30.480
Yeah, okay.

42:30.480 --> 42:38.480
As you poke your head through the hatch, you can see the slithering yellow demons that

42:38.480 --> 42:40.440
you fought before.

42:40.440 --> 42:43.400
They wail, painful wails as they move about.

42:43.400 --> 42:45.240
They take no notice of you.

42:45.240 --> 42:48.240
Metal pipes, tubes, and gauges are lining the walls of the chamber.

42:48.240 --> 42:50.760
You can see three doors, left, right, and center.

42:50.760 --> 42:53.320
Are those doors labeled in any way?

42:53.320 --> 42:55.320
Left, right, and center.

42:55.320 --> 43:03.880
That's good thinking.

43:03.880 --> 43:05.800
Can I make it to a door undetected?

43:05.800 --> 43:08.000
You can certainly try.

43:08.000 --> 43:14.160
I use my gnome ability to sneak, and I sneak towards the first door, the left door.

43:14.160 --> 43:17.240
All right, do you have any ranks and move silently?

43:17.240 --> 43:18.240
Don't I?

43:18.240 --> 43:19.240
Probably not, but...

43:19.240 --> 43:21.640
I thought I was good at sneaking about.

43:21.640 --> 43:22.640
Uh, maybe.

43:22.640 --> 43:23.640
I have fast movement.

43:23.640 --> 43:24.640
I use my fast movement.

43:24.640 --> 43:27.600
All right.

43:27.600 --> 43:29.800
Moving swiftly, you cross the floor.

43:29.800 --> 43:30.800
You make it towards the...

43:30.800 --> 43:31.800
What door?

43:31.800 --> 43:32.800
The center door?

43:32.800 --> 43:33.800
Left door.

43:33.800 --> 43:34.800
Left door.

43:34.800 --> 43:35.800
This door is locked.

43:35.800 --> 43:38.100
There's strange script written on the door.

43:38.100 --> 43:39.760
You don't understand the language.

43:39.760 --> 43:43.360
I go to the center door.

43:43.360 --> 43:46.200
You approach the center door.

43:46.200 --> 43:50.640
You hear the sound of large explosions coming from the other side of the door.

43:50.640 --> 43:51.640
Nice.

43:51.640 --> 43:54.320
I open the door.

43:54.320 --> 43:58.680
You open the door, and what you see is so...

43:58.680 --> 44:00.480
We cut to another character.

44:00.480 --> 44:01.480
Okay.

44:01.480 --> 44:02.480
All right.

44:02.480 --> 44:03.480
Yeah.

44:03.480 --> 44:04.480
Act Break.

44:04.480 --> 44:05.480
Goldbond powder.

44:05.480 --> 44:11.000
Sharpie, you're standing out front of Yellow Camp.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.040
Corpses and destroyed machines litter the ground.

44:13.040 --> 44:15.960
The remaining barbarians are hauling their own into the Great Tent.

44:15.960 --> 44:19.640
The gnolls are also gathered around their dead, but rather than bearing or hauling the corpses,

44:19.640 --> 44:23.320
the gnolls strip their breath in and then consume the fallen.

44:23.320 --> 44:24.320
Some is never glamorous.

44:24.320 --> 44:25.320
Yes.

44:25.320 --> 44:27.560
You can see your father standing at the entrance of the Great Tent.

44:27.560 --> 44:29.200
He's surveying the work being done.

44:29.200 --> 44:33.560
From the east, you can see a horse and rider, fast approaching.

44:33.560 --> 44:34.560
Dad.

44:34.560 --> 44:35.560
Yes?

44:35.560 --> 44:36.560
I mean...

44:36.560 --> 44:37.560
Yes.

44:37.560 --> 44:40.560
Come clean with me.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.040
What the hell's going on?

44:42.040 --> 44:43.040
Who's this...

44:43.040 --> 44:44.480
Who's this Admiral Darkstar?

44:44.480 --> 44:45.480
I don't know.

44:45.480 --> 44:47.840
They just came down in those ships.

44:47.840 --> 44:48.920
Did you see that shit?

44:48.920 --> 44:51.160
That was crazy.

44:51.160 --> 44:59.160
The sky opened up, but okay, I got some bad news to tell you.

44:59.160 --> 45:02.880
You know how I said I had a couple of shards?

45:02.880 --> 45:05.080
They're gone.

45:05.080 --> 45:08.520
I still have yet to poop out that other one, but...

45:08.520 --> 45:10.000
Wait, what do you mean?

45:10.000 --> 45:11.800
I think they've been stolen.

45:11.800 --> 45:12.800
Dad.

45:12.800 --> 45:13.800
Gas.

45:13.800 --> 45:16.600
You know what?

45:16.600 --> 45:20.720
I grew up my whole life thinking that you thought I was a piece of shit.

45:20.720 --> 45:24.120
I come back, turns out you're a piece of shit.

45:24.120 --> 45:26.880
Well, that's the barbarian way.

45:26.880 --> 45:29.120
Well, he does a little dance.

45:29.120 --> 45:30.120
What was that?

45:30.120 --> 45:33.200
That's the barbarian way.

45:33.200 --> 45:34.320
It's like Nashville style.

45:34.320 --> 45:35.320
Nashville style.

45:35.320 --> 45:37.320
Well, but Nashville style.

45:37.320 --> 45:38.320
Oh, wait.

45:38.320 --> 45:39.320
Nope.

45:39.320 --> 45:40.320
Oh, boy.

45:40.320 --> 45:41.320
Okay, lame.

45:41.320 --> 45:42.320
Yeah, lame.

45:42.320 --> 45:43.320
Fine.

45:43.320 --> 45:46.000
I accept that I'm lame.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.680
Where did your friend go?

45:48.680 --> 45:54.360
I hoisted him onto a cylinder, and he's now in the mothership of these things that you're

45:54.360 --> 45:56.880
fighting with that you don't know anything about.

45:56.880 --> 46:00.280
And I'm a piece of shit?

46:00.280 --> 46:04.040
Are you going to go after him?

46:04.040 --> 46:06.280
I'd like to.

46:06.280 --> 46:07.760
Okay.

46:07.760 --> 46:10.560
Well, can you fly?

46:10.560 --> 46:12.360
You're a wizard, right?

46:12.360 --> 46:13.360
A wizard?

46:13.360 --> 46:14.360
Oh, oh.

46:14.360 --> 46:15.360
A wizard.

46:15.360 --> 46:16.360
I'm sorry, dad.

46:16.360 --> 46:17.360
I've had a lot to drink.

46:17.360 --> 46:18.920
I can't enunciate.

46:18.920 --> 46:19.920
Yes.

46:19.920 --> 46:20.920
I'm a wizard.

46:20.920 --> 46:21.920
I don't know.

46:21.920 --> 46:24.040
I can't, dad, I can't fly.

46:24.040 --> 46:27.200
I can feather fall when you throw me out a window.

46:27.200 --> 46:33.840
I can abate physical feeling when you hit me with a belt.

46:33.840 --> 46:40.880
I can create a bubble around myself emotionally when you make me feel like a piece of shit.

46:40.880 --> 46:42.040
That's not even magic.

46:42.040 --> 46:46.320
That's just therapy.

46:46.320 --> 46:48.560
What is therapy?

46:48.560 --> 46:53.000
Dad, I love you.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
I hug him.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.160
I give him a plus one hug.

46:58.160 --> 46:59.160
Only one?

46:59.160 --> 47:00.160
Yeah.

47:00.160 --> 47:03.880
Hug successful.

47:03.880 --> 47:05.680
You seem to have broken through.

47:05.680 --> 47:07.600
Dad, don't you get it?

47:07.600 --> 47:10.560
Power doesn't have a definition.

47:10.560 --> 47:11.840
Some of us are magicians.

47:11.840 --> 47:13.440
Some of us are barbarians.

47:13.440 --> 47:14.640
Power is power.

47:14.640 --> 47:19.160
There's nothing more important than the bond between father and son.

47:19.160 --> 47:20.160
You're a barbarian.

47:20.160 --> 47:22.480
I'm a magic user.

47:22.480 --> 47:23.480
That's the way it goes.

47:23.480 --> 47:26.000
The important thing is our name.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.440
We've got to bring these fucking ships down.

47:29.440 --> 47:32.320
My friend is up on one of them.

47:32.320 --> 47:33.320
What are you doing?

47:33.320 --> 47:36.240
Logging in my iPad.

47:36.240 --> 47:37.240
You've touched him.

47:37.240 --> 47:38.240
You've touched him.

47:38.240 --> 47:39.240
Your words have touched him.

47:39.240 --> 47:40.240
All right.

47:40.240 --> 47:43.480
The hug was touching.

47:43.480 --> 47:44.760
Nothing occurs.

47:44.760 --> 47:46.440
He says, you're right.

47:46.440 --> 47:50.600
You are my son and you're greater at magic than I will ever be.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.680
So now it's time for you to have this.

47:52.680 --> 47:56.880
He takes the multicolored cloak off his shoulders and bestows it upon you.

47:56.880 --> 48:02.000
He says, this cloak is made from the very canvas that forms these great tents and is

48:02.000 --> 48:04.360
infused with great magic.

48:04.360 --> 48:07.280
It can give you the power of limited teleportation.

48:07.280 --> 48:24.720
I got it by a minute, by a minute, hour by hour, I got a cloak from my dad, now I can

48:24.720 --> 48:25.720
go places.

48:25.720 --> 48:26.720
Whoa.

48:26.720 --> 48:27.720
Yeah.

48:27.720 --> 48:28.720
All races.

48:28.720 --> 48:29.720
Oh shit.

48:29.720 --> 48:30.720
All right.

48:30.720 --> 48:31.720
Sorry.

48:31.720 --> 48:32.720
A little dance break.

48:32.720 --> 48:33.720
Yeah.

48:33.720 --> 48:34.720
All races.

48:34.720 --> 48:40.840
Mulraine, you're among the trees in a small grove.

48:40.840 --> 48:41.840
I.

48:41.840 --> 48:45.960
Few venture to this grove as knowledge of the magical forest died along with your five children

48:45.960 --> 48:48.440
in the massive blaze that consumed your home.

48:48.440 --> 48:49.440
Yes.

48:49.440 --> 48:50.440
I remember.

48:50.440 --> 48:52.960
I think about it every day.

48:52.960 --> 49:01.160
You hear the winning and neighing of a struggling horse not far off breaking your meditation.

49:01.160 --> 49:02.960
Is there an animal in pain?

49:02.960 --> 49:04.720
I rushed to the animal.

49:04.720 --> 49:05.720
Winnie.

49:05.720 --> 49:06.720
Nay.

49:06.720 --> 49:11.080
You see a horse tied to a tree and a woman sitting on the ground propped up against

49:11.080 --> 49:12.080
a tree.

49:12.080 --> 49:15.440
Upon closer inspection, he realized the woman is dead.

49:15.440 --> 49:18.360
Her throat is slit and a dagger is sitting on the ground nearby.

49:18.360 --> 49:22.760
There's a piece of parchment on the paper.

49:22.760 --> 49:23.960
It's a harsh world.

49:23.960 --> 49:24.960
There's monsters and.

49:24.960 --> 49:28.600
There are spaceships and I'm dealing with a mutilated woman.

49:28.600 --> 49:31.120
It's important.

49:31.120 --> 49:37.400
Dear woman, I, oh, oh, oh, oh.

49:37.400 --> 49:39.320
I must, I must bury you.

49:39.320 --> 49:44.320
I must show you the honor that my children were not shown.

49:44.320 --> 49:45.320
I.

49:45.320 --> 49:46.320
She doesn't respond.

49:46.320 --> 49:47.320
No.

49:47.320 --> 49:51.360
No, you must be awake, please, wake up, please.

49:51.360 --> 49:57.960
I slap her face in the sad way when someone does a movie based on a Michael Crichton film.

49:57.960 --> 50:03.160
I keep on slapping her face.

50:03.160 --> 50:04.160
Yep.

50:04.160 --> 50:08.680
I, I, I try to untie the horse.

50:08.680 --> 50:10.680
You untie the horse.

50:10.680 --> 50:14.440
It stands and regards you.

50:14.440 --> 50:20.960
Dear horse, I regard you as well.

50:20.960 --> 50:22.960
I nuzzle the horse.

50:22.960 --> 50:26.360
The horse is nuzzled.

50:26.360 --> 50:29.360
It seems as if it, it wants to say something.

50:29.360 --> 50:30.360
Yeah.

50:30.360 --> 50:35.720
No, not like that.

50:35.720 --> 50:37.120
You have wild empathy.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.600
You can empathize with the horse.

50:38.600 --> 50:40.760
It seems to say.

50:40.760 --> 50:42.560
I use my wild empathy.

50:42.560 --> 50:49.080
You can, you can ride on me.

50:49.080 --> 50:52.360
Horses aren't very eloquent.

50:52.360 --> 50:56.360
Dear horse, I hear your message and I shall do your bidding.

50:56.360 --> 50:58.360
I will ride you.

50:58.360 --> 51:00.360
All right.

51:00.360 --> 51:03.360
The horses just stand there now.

51:03.360 --> 51:05.360
That, that horse is standing there.

51:05.360 --> 51:06.360
Okay.

51:06.360 --> 51:10.360
I leap upon the horse and I'm really cute when I do it.

51:10.360 --> 51:15.360
Leaping upon the saddle, you notice a bit of paper sticking outside the saddle.

51:15.360 --> 51:17.360
I ignore the paper.

51:17.360 --> 51:19.360
You ignore the paper.

51:19.360 --> 51:21.360
I pick up the paper.

51:21.360 --> 51:22.360
I read the paper.

51:22.360 --> 51:23.360
I read the paper.

51:23.360 --> 51:24.360
I read the paper.

51:24.360 --> 51:25.360
Never, never read the paper.

51:25.360 --> 51:26.360
Probably nothing.

51:26.360 --> 51:31.360
To whoever reads this, know that I was a man known for my comically oversized pants.

51:31.360 --> 51:33.360
I was always tripping over my own legs.

51:33.360 --> 51:37.360
In search of a belt, I finally found one after slaying a group of orcs.

51:37.360 --> 51:39.360
When I put it on, I realized that I'd become a woman.

51:39.360 --> 51:41.360
So I killed myself.

51:41.360 --> 51:42.360
Have a nice day.

51:42.360 --> 51:45.360
Don't wear this belt unless you're into that sort of thing.

51:45.360 --> 51:53.360
Signed baggy pants ohula hand.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.360
It's a note from Sinbag.

51:55.360 --> 51:56.360
Oh my.

51:56.360 --> 51:59.360
I, I, I, I'm excited.

51:59.360 --> 52:00.360
I start to cry a little bit.

52:00.360 --> 52:01.360
I do a little dance.

52:01.360 --> 52:02.360
I, I find the belt.

52:02.360 --> 52:04.360
The belt's around the dead woman, right?

52:04.360 --> 52:05.360
Yes.

52:05.360 --> 52:06.360
I grab the belt.

52:06.360 --> 52:08.360
That happens.

52:08.360 --> 52:11.360
I, I put the belt on.

52:11.360 --> 52:13.360
You, you put on the belt.

52:13.360 --> 52:15.360
You transformed into a man.

52:15.360 --> 52:16.360
Woman.

52:16.360 --> 52:17.360
Woman man.

52:17.360 --> 52:18.360
Woman.

52:18.360 --> 52:19.360
I'm back.

52:19.360 --> 52:31.360
I shake out my long, long hair.

52:31.360 --> 52:34.360
And I, I puff my breasts.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.360
That's a thing, right?

52:36.360 --> 52:42.360
Are you looking to see if puffing your breasts is a thing?

52:42.360 --> 52:43.360
I left.

52:43.360 --> 52:47.360
I must, I must find Sharpie.

52:47.360 --> 52:51.360
But first I, I fashion a dress out of leaves.

52:51.360 --> 52:52.360
That happens.

52:52.360 --> 52:58.360
And I, I get on the horse and I start heading towards Sharpie.

52:58.360 --> 52:59.360
Okay.

52:59.360 --> 53:01.360
Cut back to, uh, quirk.

53:01.360 --> 53:03.360
Which store were you going for again?

53:03.360 --> 53:06.360
I was going to the door with explosions going on behind.

53:06.360 --> 53:07.360
Ah.

53:07.360 --> 53:08.360
Senator.

53:08.360 --> 53:09.360
You opened the door.

53:09.360 --> 53:11.360
The room is long, running the length of the ship.

53:11.360 --> 53:13.360
All cannons are lined up and outside of the ship.

53:13.360 --> 53:16.360
A few of those yellow demons, as well as one black creature,

53:16.360 --> 53:18.360
are roaming up and down the aisle.

53:18.360 --> 53:20.360
Occasionally one slithers up to a cannon,

53:20.360 --> 53:23.360
adjusts it, and fires it off with a loud explosion.

53:23.360 --> 53:25.360
They don't regard you.

53:25.360 --> 53:28.360
Are these, are these the, um, the harpoon cannons or just regular?

53:28.360 --> 53:29.360
These are regular cannons.

53:29.360 --> 53:30.360
Regular cannons.

53:30.360 --> 53:31.360
Hmm.

53:31.360 --> 53:36.360
Is there anything beyond the, is there a door beyond those people?

53:36.360 --> 53:37.360
There's no door.

53:37.360 --> 53:39.360
It just leads back to the main room.

53:39.360 --> 53:42.360
Can I, I, I, I, I, I intimidate them.

53:42.360 --> 53:46.360
You intimidate, uh, which, there's two different kinds of monsters.

53:46.360 --> 53:49.360
Uh, I intimidate, uh, the, the, the, who's more threatening,

53:49.360 --> 53:51.360
the slimy guys or the black dude?

53:51.360 --> 53:52.360
Uh.

53:52.360 --> 53:54.360
I didn't mean it like that.

53:54.360 --> 53:59.360
I'd say the black, uh, creature is a bit more, uh, threatening.

53:59.360 --> 54:00.360
Yeah, you would.

54:00.360 --> 54:01.360
Yeah.

54:01.360 --> 54:03.360
Uh, well, typical.

54:03.360 --> 54:06.360
Uh, I, I, I try to intimidate the black guy.

54:06.360 --> 54:11.360
Oh.

54:11.360 --> 54:13.360
What's your, uh, what's your intimidate bonus?

54:13.360 --> 54:18.360
Uh, my intimidate, where the hell, uh, nine.

54:18.360 --> 54:19.360
You intimidate him.

54:19.360 --> 54:21.360
He doesn't seem to speak the same language as you,

54:21.360 --> 54:22.360
but he cowers in fear.

54:22.360 --> 54:24.360
He starts hissing.

54:24.360 --> 54:27.360
Uh, power attack.

54:27.360 --> 54:31.360
Uh, one or three, one, two, three.

54:31.360 --> 54:32.360
What, what's the difference?

54:32.360 --> 54:33.360
Oh, you should, oh, I was saying three.

54:33.360 --> 54:36.360
The higher the number, the less accurate, but the more damage.

54:36.360 --> 54:37.360
Okay.

54:37.360 --> 54:38.360
Two.

54:38.360 --> 54:39.360
Two.

54:39.360 --> 54:40.360
Yeah.

54:40.360 --> 54:41.360
Oh, critical hit.

54:41.360 --> 54:42.360
Fuck yeah.

54:42.360 --> 54:48.360
You're ready for this?

54:48.360 --> 54:51.360
You slice the monster in half and it burns into pieces.

54:51.360 --> 54:52.360
All right.

54:52.360 --> 54:54.360
What, what do the slimy, what do the slimy guys do?

54:54.360 --> 54:58.360
They, they look at you before continuing on.

54:58.360 --> 55:01.360
I run past them to the opposite end of the corridor.

55:01.360 --> 55:02.360
That happens.

55:02.360 --> 55:05.360
I, I, I look for a door to move, to move through it.

55:05.360 --> 55:06.360
There's no other doors.

55:06.360 --> 55:08.360
Just the one that leads back to where you came.

55:08.360 --> 55:09.360
Hmm.

55:09.360 --> 55:10.360
Say what?

55:10.360 --> 55:12.360
Berserker, she wants me to go into Berserker rage.

55:12.360 --> 55:13.360
I don't even know.

55:13.360 --> 55:15.360
Uh, is there any use for the, for me to use these cannons?

55:15.360 --> 55:19.360
I mean, if you want to like shoot things, maybe like on the ground.

55:19.360 --> 55:20.360
Say what?

55:20.360 --> 55:21.360
Attack the slugs.

55:21.360 --> 55:26.360
Attack the slugs, but they're not doing me any, any dirt.

55:26.360 --> 55:27.360
Yeah.

55:27.360 --> 55:28.360
Okay.

55:28.360 --> 55:31.360
So I use, I use flaming sword on one of the slimy guys.

55:31.360 --> 55:32.360
Yeah.

55:32.360 --> 55:33.360
You miss.

55:33.360 --> 55:34.360
Shit.

55:34.360 --> 55:36.360
Now what?

55:36.360 --> 55:38.360
The slug turns and faces you.

55:38.360 --> 55:41.360
It quickly slithers to a button and hits it.

55:41.360 --> 55:42.360
Uh-oh.

55:42.360 --> 55:43.360
You hear a siren.

55:43.360 --> 55:44.360
Cut to.

55:44.360 --> 55:47.360
Uh, Dan.

55:47.360 --> 55:48.360
Oh yeah.

55:48.360 --> 55:49.360
You're back with your father.

55:49.360 --> 55:51.360
You're having a tender moment.

55:51.360 --> 55:52.360
Right.

55:52.360 --> 55:54.360
The horse and rider approaches.

55:54.360 --> 55:56.360
But he gave me his curtain, right?

55:56.360 --> 55:57.360
Yeah.

55:57.360 --> 55:58.360
He has your cloak.

55:58.360 --> 55:59.360
Cloak.

55:59.360 --> 56:00.360
It rides up.

56:00.360 --> 56:01.360
It's a half-elf.

56:01.360 --> 56:02.360
Female.

56:02.360 --> 56:03.360
Yay.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.360
Hi.

56:04.360 --> 56:05.360
Hi.

56:05.360 --> 56:06.360
Mulvane.

56:06.360 --> 56:07.360
You're a woman.

56:07.360 --> 56:08.360
Yes.

56:08.360 --> 56:09.360
I am.

56:09.360 --> 56:19.360
I shake out my hair and it's like sparkles and stars fall from my hair.

56:19.360 --> 56:24.360
I, I, I have, I have my dad's cloak now.

56:24.360 --> 56:31.360
This is a relationship born in a horrible self-interest.

56:31.360 --> 56:36.360
I don't, I don't understand what you mean.

56:36.360 --> 56:40.360
Well, I, I, you know, I can, I can provide for you now because I can teleport and now

56:40.360 --> 56:42.360
you have a vagina.

56:42.360 --> 56:44.360
I feel like we've-

56:44.360 --> 56:50.360
I always had a mind vagina.

56:50.360 --> 56:56.360
On my way over here, I realized that you should have fallen in love with me as a person and

56:56.360 --> 56:59.360
not as a beautiful woman that I am.

56:59.360 --> 57:03.360
So perhaps for a little while we should just be companions.

57:03.360 --> 57:04.360
I-

57:04.360 --> 57:05.360
What?

57:05.360 --> 57:06.360
Dungeon snap.

57:06.360 --> 57:10.360
Dungeon snap?

57:10.360 --> 57:12.360
I, I haven't a side with the horse.

57:12.360 --> 57:15.360
The horse looks at you.

57:15.360 --> 57:16.360
Horse.

57:16.360 --> 57:18.360
I, I love him so much.

57:18.360 --> 57:21.360
I just want to know that it's real.

57:21.360 --> 57:26.360
It, I'm just a horse.

57:26.360 --> 57:28.360
And that's why I love you too, horse.

57:28.360 --> 57:30.360
That's why I love you too.

57:30.360 --> 57:32.360
I love, hey.

57:32.360 --> 57:34.360
Oh, horse.

57:34.360 --> 57:35.360
I turn back.

57:35.360 --> 57:37.360
Hey, listen.

57:37.360 --> 57:41.360
I don't know what I did wrong before you were a chick, but I, I, I think you're, you're,

57:41.360 --> 57:43.360
you're really attractive now.

57:43.360 --> 57:44.360
I, I, I didn't-

57:44.360 --> 57:45.360
Well-

57:45.360 --> 57:47.360
My, my friend is on a spaceship.

57:47.360 --> 57:48.360
Let's help him.

57:48.360 --> 57:49.360
Yes.

57:49.360 --> 57:50.360
He's always been there for me.

57:50.360 --> 57:51.360
Yes.

57:51.360 --> 57:55.360
Let's, let's, let's, let's go rescue him.

57:55.360 --> 57:58.360
No, please let's rescue him.

57:58.360 --> 57:59.360
Yes.

57:59.360 --> 58:01.360
No, let's rescue him.

58:01.360 --> 58:02.360
Let's please.

58:02.360 --> 58:03.360
I'll be there.

58:03.360 --> 58:04.360
Dad.

58:04.360 --> 58:05.360
Dad.

58:05.360 --> 58:06.360
Hey, hey.

58:06.360 --> 58:07.360
What?

58:07.360 --> 58:13.360
Is there any way I can use your coat of teleportation to, to teleport up to the spaceships that-

58:13.360 --> 58:14.360
Well-

58:14.360 --> 58:18.360
Can I grab your moonshot? Can I take your moonshots?

58:18.360 --> 58:20.360
You're hitting that pretty hard, man.

58:20.360 --> 58:22.360
This jar is like half empty.

58:22.360 --> 58:29.360
Can I grab your, can I grab your smart juice from here?

58:29.360 --> 58:35.360
You can teleport to anything you see, maybe, or like, there's a couple places you could

58:35.360 --> 58:37.360
just go to without seeing.

58:37.360 --> 58:40.360
You got a finesse.

58:40.360 --> 58:41.360
Not good with the magic.

58:41.360 --> 58:43.360
Do I see the Dark Star Starships?

58:43.360 --> 58:44.360
You can see it on the horizon.

58:44.360 --> 58:45.360
All right.

58:45.360 --> 58:46.360
It's very far away.

58:46.360 --> 58:49.360
I can use my cloak to try to teleport to the, to, to them.

58:49.360 --> 58:51.360
Can you, I jump inside the cloak.

58:51.360 --> 58:54.360
In a whirling flourish, you teleport.

58:54.360 --> 58:56.360
You find yourself in a metal room.

58:56.360 --> 58:58.360
Cannons light the room.

58:58.360 --> 59:00.360
Barbarian gnome stands before you.

59:00.360 --> 59:01.360
Hey!

59:01.360 --> 59:02.360
I did it!

59:02.360 --> 59:03.360
I-

59:03.360 --> 59:04.360
Sharpie!

59:04.360 --> 59:05.360
Sorry, wait.

59:05.360 --> 59:07.360
I took pretty much of myself to a certain death.

59:07.360 --> 59:08.360
Am I there or am I still there?

59:08.360 --> 59:09.360
You're there.

59:09.360 --> 59:10.360
Okay.

59:10.360 --> 59:11.360
Hey!

59:11.360 --> 59:12.360
You're all there.

59:12.360 --> 59:13.360
Sharpie!

59:13.360 --> 59:14.360
Are you there?

59:14.360 --> 59:15.360
Moraine!

59:15.360 --> 59:18.360
It's me, and now I'm a lovely lady.

59:18.360 --> 59:21.360
Wow, that changes everything.

59:21.360 --> 59:22.360
Nice leave dress.

59:22.360 --> 59:23.360
Thank you.

59:23.360 --> 59:26.360
I fashioned it.

59:26.360 --> 59:30.360
Uh, meanwhile, there's a Slimey guy's firing cannons over here.

59:30.360 --> 59:31.360
A little help?

59:31.360 --> 59:36.360
I, uh, I, I take two arrows.

59:36.360 --> 59:40.360
I fire the arrows at the Slimey guys.

59:40.360 --> 59:42.360
Do you have your sheet?

59:42.360 --> 59:43.360
What's your attack bonus?

59:43.360 --> 59:45.360
Uh, it's like a thousand.

59:45.360 --> 59:46.360
It's like a thousand.

59:46.360 --> 59:47.360
Uh, my-

59:47.360 --> 59:49.360
You hit with both arrows.

59:49.360 --> 59:50.360
Woohoo!

59:50.360 --> 59:51.360
Really?

59:51.360 --> 59:52.360
Yeah.

59:52.360 --> 59:58.360
I, guys, I hit with two arrows.

59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.360
Your arrows strike the remaining demon in the eyes.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.360
It falls dead.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.360
I just want to.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.360
I just want to.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.360
A thousand bonus.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.360
Well, he knew I was kidding.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.360
He adjusted it.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.360
I read it on her sheet.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:11.360
It's plus three.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.360
All right.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.360
We should probably stop there, right?

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.360
Cliffhanger!

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.360
Yeah.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.360
Cliffhanger!

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.360
Can I get those lids?

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.360
You okay, Dan?

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.360
I'm fine.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:34.360
You seem like you're kind of just descending into some sort of weird madness.

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:39.360
I may be slowly going blind, uh, as they say.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.360
I-

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.360
It's Nashville.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.360
Can I leave yet?

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.360
That was awesome.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:48.360
The reason why rock and roll and blues and grunge, I think, were invented here is because

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.360
there's no wrong answers.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:57.360
Uh, and so we have to, we have to finish up the show with, uh, no, no, I'm sorry, I know

01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.360
we could be here forever.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:03.360
We have to, uh, holy shit, that moonshine fucked me up bad.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.360
I'm so sorry.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.360
If you want, if you want your money back, I'm in back.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:12.360
I, I, I think, I think, uh, as drunk as you might be right now, I think now is the time

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.360
to test your rapping abilities.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.360
Because throughout-

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.360
Because throughout-

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.360
Can we do, can we do one thing first?

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:21.360
The camera crew had, can we outfit me with the, uh, Jacques Cousteau?

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.360
Uh, uh, I want to work the crowd.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.360
Okay.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.360
Okay.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.360
Can we get Dan the chest GoPro camera?

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.360
All right.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.360
We had this thing-

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.360
Ryan from our crew, everybody, is that coming up?

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.360
Uh, he's going to-

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.360
Outfit.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.360
I think-

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:39.360
We're working the crowd lately.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:44.360
I think we have to, uh, Dan's worried about his rapping abilities, and they're not getting

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.360
any stronger for some reason.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:50.360
Uh, you'd think that as much as Dan raps about fucking people's mom is that there would

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.360
be some notable improvements.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:02:00.360
But I think maybe, maybe you can harness, as you're being harnessed, literally, you could-

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.360
Okay.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.360
All right.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:03.360
You can harness-

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:04.360
I don't want to come out there.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.360
I'm going to work the crowd.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.360
All right.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.360
Do you want-

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.360
Are you going to be rapping?

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.360
You want to beat?

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.360
No, no, no.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.360
This isn't about-

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.360
This isn't about rapping.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.360
This is about personal relationships.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.360
Like, I want to know who's out there.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.360
Yeah.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.360
We're going to the crowd.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.360
Thank you, sir.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:23.360
It's-

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:24.360
All right.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.360
Here we go!

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.360
Yeah!

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.360
Go work-

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.360
Go work stage right.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.360
They've been neglected tonight.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:35.360
This is going to be a fucking fiasco.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:40.360
I know it.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.360
All right.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.360
This guy first.

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.360
What's your name?

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.360
Zach.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.360
Nice try.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.360
That's how you work the crowd.

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:52.360
You ask people shit, then you make fun of them.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.360
What's your name, ma'am?

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:55.360
Tanika.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.360
How do you know when you finished?

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.360
Oh!

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.360
All right.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.360
Sorry.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.360
I'm going to get personal.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.360
He's so drunk.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.360
What's your-

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.360
What's your name?

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:04.360
Tanika.

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.360
Tanika.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.360
More like fun-ika.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.360
Are you from Nashville?

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.360
No.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.360
Good.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.360
Me neither.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.360
Yeah!

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:12.360
What are you doing here?

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:13.360
Acting.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:14.360
What for?

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.360
For fun?

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.360
For-

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.360
Why?

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.360
Because?

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.360
What do you mean?

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.360
For-

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.360
For-

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.360
For-

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.360
For-

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.360
For-

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.360
For-

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.360
For-

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.360
For-

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:28.360
For-

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:29.360
What do you mean?

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.360
O-

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.360
Working the crowd!

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.360
Yeah!

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.360
Tanika!

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.360
Oh!

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.360
Hi!

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.360
What's your name?

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.360
Sarah.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.360
What's your-

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.360
Sarah!

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.360
What-

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:41.360
What are you-

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:42.360
Why-

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.360
Why-

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.360
Why, why sit here?

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.360
Best seat in the house?

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.360
Best seat in the house?

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.360
Best seat in the house?

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.360
Best seat in the house?

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.360
Best seat in the house?

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.360
Best seat in the-

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.360
Best seat in the-

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.360
Best seat in the-

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.360
Best seat in the house?

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.360
Yes.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.360
More like, worse seat in the-

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.360
In the apartment!

01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:57.360
doivent

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.360
No, take it easy.

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:03.360
If you could have anything you wanted, what would you have?

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.360
Sorry, that was...

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:10.360
Alright, Jeff, give me a second.

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.360
Okay.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.360
What was your name?

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.360
Sarah.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.360
Sarah.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.360
We got Sarah back here, Jeff.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.360
Right?

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.360
Yeah.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:22.360
Jeff, Sarah, what's your favorite car?

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:27.360
I heard Ferrari.

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.360
Woo, Ferrari!

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.360
Okay, Jeff, this isn't working out so good.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.360
Working the crowd.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.360
Are you going to sing an R&B song to her right now?

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.360
No, no.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.360
Alright, what's your name, Sarah?

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.360
Sing a sexy R&B song, then.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.360
What's your name, Sarah?

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:44.360
Andrew.

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:48.360
Andrew, what's the name of the girl that broke your heart the most?

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:52.360
Oh, shit, uh, Viv.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.360
Viv?

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:54.360
Shit.

01:04:58.360 --> 01:04:59.360
You playing it?

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.360
You playing the song?

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.360
I'll give you a rap beat.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:02.360
How about that?

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.360
Yeah, what was your name again, Sarah?

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.360
Andrew.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:09.360
Yeah, I think then Andrew got his heart broke by Viv.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.360
Would you fuck his mama?

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:14.360
I don't think so.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:23.360
I think tonight's about reaching out to him.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.360
Alright, let me keep working the crowd.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.360
I'm sorry.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.360
What's your name?

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.360
Haley.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.360
Haley?

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.360
How do you know when you're finished?

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.360
Alright.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.360
Wait, just, yeah.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.360
Dan, it seems like you're afraid of human connection right now.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.360
What's your name?

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.360
Matt.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.360
Matt?

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.360
I don't think so.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:47.360
We're going to the crowd, we're going to the crowd.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.360
You're glassing over real humanity out there, Dan.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.360
What's your name?

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.360
Jonathan.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.360
I don't think so.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.360
Alright.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.360
Alright, hold on a second.

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.360
It'll be fine, it'll be fine, don't worry about it.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:12.360
I'm going to go, I'm going deeper than anyone's ever worked, any crowd.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:16.360
I'm going back to the people that have never been worked.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:19.360
These guys never thought they'd be talked to, did you?

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.360
What's your name?

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.360
Matt.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.360
Matt!

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.360
What do you do?

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.360
For a living.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.360
How do you know when you're finished?

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:32.360
Alright, Jim will be back to the stage and Ashley, or who is it?

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:35.360
Yeah, Ashley, get back up here and Josh on percussion.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:39.360
Let's get the band back together.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.360
You can share a stool.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.360
Alright.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:48.360
I apologize, everybody honestly.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:52.360
All your money will be sitting in a pile by the exit.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:56.360
You can just take whatever you thought tonight cost you.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:02.360
Some of you drove here six hours, just take $600.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.360
I will support you.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.360
That's all I want.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.360
Dan, why are you so down on yourself right now?

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:14.360
It's almost like you drank like four ounces of some sort of high-octane.

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:19.360
High-octane depressant.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.360
What's the chord progression of the Harvard Town song?

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:29.360
E minor, C, G, D.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:34.360
If you're going to join us in Charlotte, learn this and bring it.

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:53.360
Such an honor to be with good people from church to church, steeple to steeple.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:59.360
I saw your mama suck to titties and never been in such a good city.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.360
Nashville got horrible racisms.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.360
It doesn't matter.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:08.360
There's no schism between you and between me.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:12.360
Let's go south and let's go.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:16.360
Come on round, hold it down.

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:19.360
Turn that frown upside down.

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:22.360
He is yellow, poop is brown.

01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.360
Come on down a hundred times.

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:28.360
I'm too drunk, too much moonshine.

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:31.360
I'm sorry I didn't drink more white wine.

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.360
I just wish I could hang out and talk to you.

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:38.360
I'm so sorry my set turned to pee and poo.

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.360
I didn't mean to disappoint you.

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:44.360
$22 is what you spent.

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:47.360
I let you down.

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.360
Hold it.

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:52.360
Turn that frown upside down.

01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:55.360
Yellow, poop is brown.

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.360
Come on down a hundred times.

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:02.360
Self ridicule at the end of the station.

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:05.360
I can't take it no more.

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.360
I feel like a bad person.

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:11.360
Oh shit, it's terrible watching this happen.

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:16.360
Don't clap, don't laugh, don't applaud.

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:19.360
You're just looking at a guy that's a club.

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.360
He's got, he's traveling across the country.

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:24.360
He's got shit to write, but instead he's going around

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.360
and doing this.

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.360
It's a terrible thing to do.

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:32.360
I'm so sorry that I made a friend of you.

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:35.360
You guys were very fine in the back

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.360
and you bought me Jagger bonds

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.360
and now you're a friend of mine.

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:44.360
Jagger bonds and now I give you a price attack.

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:47.360
That means, what does that mean?

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.360
I can't.

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:52.360
Come on down a hundred times.

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:55.360
Turn that frown upside down.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.360
Shame.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.360
Yellow, poop is brown.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.360
Come on down a hundred times.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.360
I'm going to flow, I'm going to rap good.

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.360
I'm going to make corn squeezes out of termite wood.

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.360
I'm going to drink a mason jar of lightening.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.360
I'm tired of rapping.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.360
I want to start fighting.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.360
I'm going to have a couple fuckers on guitar.

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.360
I want to fuck your mama so hard she plays sitar.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.360
Fuck her all the way to India.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.360
I fucked your mama.

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.360
Fuck your mama.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:29.360
God damn it.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.360
Shit.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.360
I can't let Nash feel in like this.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.360
I'm going to do goodbye.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.360
They invented Elvis.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.360
I'm going to fuck your mama so hard.

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.360
I split her pelvis.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.360
I'm going to fuck your mama.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.360
They invented blues.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.360
I'm going to fuck your mama.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.360
She can't win.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.360
She lose.

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.360
Come on down a hundred times.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:56.360
Turn that frown upside down.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.360
Bitch.

01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.360
Turn that frown upside down.

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.360
Come on down a hundred times.

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:03.360
Two drunk, two drunk.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.360
I see a double frown upside down.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.360
Yo, real yellow.

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.360
This is brown.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:13.360
Come on down a hundred times.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:16.360
Come on down a hundred times.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:19.360
Turn that frown upside down.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.360
I'm going to put Jim Lill, everybody.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.360
Jim Lill.

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.360
Ashley.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.360
Josh on the moonshine.

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.360
Erin McGathy.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:33.360
Spencer Crittenden.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.360
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:59.360
This is Dan Harmon.
