You're always in such a good mood.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:19.000\nAs a black man in America, no!\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:21.000\nWhy would you?\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:26.000\nOh, just think about cotton.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:28.000\nHappy February, by the way.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:30.000\nThank you so much.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:32.000\nCongratulations.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:36.000\nYou know, we're so happy with all the new developments.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:40.000\nWe like to say we're creating black history right now.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:46.000\nI'm sure you don't watch my Instagram workout, but I'm like fucking like really bringing the black history thunder.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:51.000\nYeah, you're like Sojourner Truth.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:53.000\nMotherfucker don't know who that is.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:55.000\nIs that black?\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:57.000\nIs it historical?\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nAlthough I'll learn about it then tomorrow.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:02.000\nYou can't keep anything from me.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:08.000\nYeah, I'm like, we're like a little past halfway through, but I work out every other day.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:13.000\nSo I'm like, I know like five of the amendments now.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:20.000\nI know that our entire hit, I know that, you know, this is going to sound corny and like white nighty or whatever you call it,\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:26.000\nvirtue signally, but like the profound thing I'm learning as a middle-aged man, like taking black history seriously,\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:30.000\nI'm reading an hour a morning going like, okay, what the fuck is Plessy versus Ferguson?\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:31.000\nHere we go.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:32.000\nOkay.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\nAnd I don't mean to make that fright sound like the truth.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:42.000\nI mean, Plessy versus Ferguson deserves that fright sound, but black history, of course, does not.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:47.000\nIf anything, it deserves a choir of angels.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:51.000\nThe black history is US history and vice versa.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:56.000\nI mean, the country is like, it's so, I mean, I know that we know that intellectually,\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:00.000\nbut I'm just sort of like, God damn, this is, everything comes out of this.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:05.000\nThis is like this weird experiment that we've done where we were the, we were kind of the, we were the worst.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:13.000\nI grew up being taught that we were like, that the US was just like playing ball with this global thing called slavery\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:16.000\nand that the US was like, okay, I guess we'll do it too.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:21.000\nWe were, we were, no, we were like really into it.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nAnd I really honestly did not know that.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:31.000\nAnd I thought, and that like, and that then this young country like spent most of its life engaged in that concept.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:36.000\nThis like, this God of capitalism that we worship, where we're like, there's no kings here.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nYou can't be born special.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:43.000\nYou could, as long as you work hard, you could take over the country.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nAnyways, get back to work for free.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:49.000\nHear ye, hear ye, those guys should be able to vote and not be owned.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:52.000\nYou're like, yeah, I agree.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:55.000\nUh-oh, what are we gonna do?\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:56.000\nIt's true.\n\n05:56.000 --> 06:00.000\nIt's amazing how much shit we got done despite all the people trying to stop us.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:06.000\nWe really were like sort of like, damn, we got to build this shit anyway.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nBecause we also needed a place to live.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nI could two different hats.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:12.000\nI put on my 1800s racist hat.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:13.000\nIt's not that hard for me.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nThis should be really heavy.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:21.000\nI'm like, it's made of wood and like Danish bones.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:22.000\nStraw.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nYou're not very good at it.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:25.000\nIt's the 1800s.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.000\nYou're not very good at hat making, but you've got a hat.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:35.000\nI'm like, well, these people in the past, they didn't know the future that they could\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\neither service or undercut every step of the way.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:45.000\nI'm a little comfortable supposing that there's probably, there's like these, we got genuine\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\neugenics style racists in the world.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:52.000\nLike people who are genuinely like, for real, let me measure your skull like fucking like\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:58.000\ncount, like no really, like they're into like the whole like biological aspect of it.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:02.000\nThose people are arts.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:06.000\nWhat we have in a much larger group is like a lot of like conservative people maybe who\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:09.000\nare like, don't tell me I owe anybody anything.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nAnd I just got here.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:12.000\nI don't have to feel guilty about anything.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:13.000\nI don't want to share my money.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.000\nI don't have that kind of shit.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:21.000\nNot so much like, I think a vast majority of us would agree actually that given what we're\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:27.000\ndealing with today, we can all look back with hindsight 100 short years ago and go, oops,\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:32.000\nthat was dumb because what that did is it fucked up for everything for everybody right\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:33.000\nnow.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:34.000\nDo you know what I mean?\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:38.000\nDo you agree or disagree with that dumb white explanation?\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nIt's interesting.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:41.000\nOkay.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:42.000\nAll right.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:45.000\nThat's so that's as much as I'm going to get out.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nThere's a lot there.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nI'm just saying like, like the great migration.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:54.000\nLike where it's like, okay, the Civil War is over and the Emancipation has happened\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:58.000\nand it's like people are just like doing what you'd expect them to do, which is just like\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:01.000\nstart to fill the rest of the country, get the fuck out of here.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:05.000\nHalf of them can't get out of here and then half of them are like, where do I go?\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:06.000\nWhat do I do?\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:07.000\nWhat do I dress like?\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:08.000\nWhat should my name be?\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nWhat is my fucking role in this country?\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:13.000\nThey hid in the woods for decades.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:18.000\nThey hid in the woods and then they started to form towns.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:21.000\nSo it got as far as Oklahoma.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nAnd then some people got here and there.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:28.000\nThe smartest thing you could do was go north, which is why you have cities like Detroit.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nBut they didn't get that far west.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:34.000\nBut for the most part, they would have to clump together in groups and hide in the woods.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:42.000\nSo that like first three, four years after slavery ends, people are just out in the woods,\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nwhich is crazy.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:48.000\nAnd it seems like cartoonishly simple.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:49.000\nIt's tragic.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nThey're cartoons that are tragic.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:55.000\nBut they're just living in the woods.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nIt literally, here's the thing.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nThis piece of history is they didn't know what to do.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nSo they just let people go.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:03.000\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:09.000\nSo when we look back at that period and we go like, so running like the white kind of\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:16.000\nlike panic simulator in my head when I go back in time and I don't have the privilege of being like\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nI'm like living in the future.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:21.000\nAnd I'm like, oh, well, of course everybody should blah, blah, blah.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:27.000\nLike who knows what I would have called self care back then as far as not getting into trouble.\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:31.000\nSome beers greased in a little bit of methylate.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:36.000\nBut like, no, everybody was like having arguments about like, well, you're free.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:40.000\nYou should go away now or you're free.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:43.000\nEveryone should give you a bunch of money now or you're free.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:44.000\nI hate you.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nI got to figure out how to make you hate yourself.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:53.000\nLike nobody was thinking about everybody was like wondering what was going to happen tomorrow.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:59.000\nAnd 80% of it was like trying to avoid something that they didn't even know what they were trying to avoid.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:00.000\nThey just were scared.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:04.000\nNo, all those three thoughts that you just had were actual thoughts that those people had.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:09.000\nSo self-hate, making black people hate themselves for sure.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nGo, go away.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:14.000\nIt was certainly part of plan.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:20.000\nI mean, there were abolitionists who were like, yeah, I hate slavery.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nWe got to get these people out of here.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:23.000\nThat blew my mind.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:26.000\nIt was like the people that were...\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:27.000\nIt's crazy.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:35.000\nIt wasn't like people were looking at this room today and going like, so what can we do to make their life...\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:43.000\nHow can we lead to that in a right way so that everyone there doesn't have a bunch of disproportionate disenfranchisement\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:52.000\nand everything's kind of confusing and in turmoil with a lot of weird debates and scary, awkward podcast conversations.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.000\nNo, no.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:54.000\nIt's not scary.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nThey weren't thinking about us.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:57.000\nThey were thinking about...\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:02.000\nThey were definitely thinking about maintaining power for at least a thousand years.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:03.000\nThere is a thousand-year plan.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:07.000\nThat's what those things are, like the Marshall Plan and all these manifest destinies is like,\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:12.000\nwhen a bunch of guys get together and say, what are we going to do for the next four or five hundred years?\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:15.000\nPeople are thinking like dynasty for real.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:22.000\nIt's crazy because we don't think like that, but there are legit dudes that are like, yeah.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:23.000\nI don't even know what I think.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:27.000\nI want to know what they could because when I think about the future, I picture a bunch of people on a space station\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:34.000\nlike harvesting soy out of a hydroponic garden and everyone looks vaguely like Tiger Woods, probably.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:38.000\nBecause we're never going to stop being racist.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:40.000\nYou're never going to eliminate racism.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:41.000\nYou're going to eliminate race.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:42.000\nAlways say that.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:43.000\nThat's the first thing that's going to happen.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:44.000\nYou always say that.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:51.000\nYou always say you're never going to eliminate racism, but remember that the thing that racism is attacking is stronger than racism.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nSo I don't know how that's possible.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:57.000\nIt's almost like you really cannot beat women.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:04.000\nYou think you can, but the the the initial like attempt at starting that war has you fucked already.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.000\nLike that's just a bad idea to begin with.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:13.000\nAnd if you look at where we're at right now, they didn't we didn't really respond the way we were supposed to respond\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:17.000\nnecessarily voting wise and we have more women in Congress.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:21.000\nWomen still figured out a way to get past us.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:28.000\nThe same thing goes for the same thing goes for race is that you you will wear yourself out trying to oppress.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:35.000\nYeah, that's a big theme of black history that I'm getting into is like noticing that basically like you have lots of people that I like.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:41.000\nNarcissistically, I go like, oh, this person is more of a Dan Harmon because they just want to be left alone.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:47.000\nThey're actually born kind of privileged relative to other people that that may have that complexion.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:50.000\nAnd actually the war came to them because they couldn't.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:55.000\nThere was these policies like this morning's lesson was about Mamie Mamie Phipps Clark.\n\n12:55.000 --> 13:02.000\nYou know, the who did the the doll test that was like a part of the Brown versus education.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:10.000\nThe doll test is taking the dolls and you you got you got dolls that have blonde hair and white faces and dolls that are brown skin and black\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:20.000\nand white and you say to kids that are like rock and rock and roll gather a bunch of kids that are two to five years old from segregated schools and from desegregated schools.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:26.000\nAnd you sit them down and white kids and black kids and girls and boys and you all these control groups and whatever.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:34.000\nAnd you say to the kids, which one is which one's the bad kid, which one's the kid you wish you were, which etc.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:43.000\nYou know, these kind of questions and like realizing that racial identity is bored into you by the age of four and then it's just fucking soldered in place.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:54.000\nLike which isn't necessarily a bad thing except when you when race is connected to class and and and worth and stuff like it's okay for a kid to know.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nI guess that there's such a thing is raised by the age of four.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nIt's really not that mature a concept.\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\nIt's kind of dopey.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:05.000\nYou could you could teach your kid to celebrate it to right, which is the deal with Black History Month.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nWe don't focus on the trauma necessarily.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:10.000\nWe focus on all the fun shit like stop likes.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:16.000\nYou know great shit like peanut butter peanut butter.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nNo, there was that's a big misconception.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:22.000\nOkay, tell me what what like is George Washington Carver.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:26.000\nHe just wanted to be left alone of all the things he did not know.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:35.000\nHe did eleven hundred things with with peanuts, but the peanut butter, but he know that fucking passive aggression.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:39.000\nWho who did it was according to Eddie Murphy.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:45.000\nIt was a guy named Thomas Jeff right right, but that's the spin is you.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:50.000\nMaybe look at Black History Month as a time to celebrate all of your great black heroes.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nNo, I not the trauma that they went through.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:57.000\nI know, believe me, there were a lot of times when I was like halfway through my workout month.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:02.000\nI'm like, I don't I don't I don't want this to be a history of racism.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:07.000\nBut then I was like, it is and I'm that's better for me.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:12.000\nLike I am following the trauma actually in point of fact like I don't follow.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:13.000\nAnd I was like, I'm going to be obscure.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:14.000\nI'm not going to look.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:18.000\nI'm not going to forget Rosa Parks because it's like that's curated and all this stuff.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:22.000\nBut it's like, I don't know shit about, you know, the details of Rosa Parks and stuff.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:27.000\nSo I'm actually just going in order from Nat Turner revolt to by the end of the month.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:32.000\nI think I'm going to be I'm going to fucking bring this thing into the station with like, you know, I don't know.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:39.000\nBut Bobby seal or there's also there's also Gerald Lewin though W.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nIt's double L E W Y N.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:45.000\nI'm not sure from saying his name right, but he's like he ran time for the longest time.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:48.000\nHe's like huge black rain time.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:49.000\nThat's not the magazine.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:53.000\nThe whole oh, oh, oh.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:59.000\nI was like somebody tell him like black man ran time.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.000\nWhite man stole it from him.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:06.000\nDon't let them pacify you with shit like that man.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:12.000\nTime isn't run by a black man.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:15.000\nIs that that guy in the hud sucker proxy?\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nBlack janitor in the hud sucker.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:18.000\nHe was basically God.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:21.000\nHe kind of like is like the janitor in the clock.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:22.000\nThe clock building.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nOh, it's a hud sucker proxy.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:25.000\nSo do you have any?\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:26.000\nDo you have any heroes?\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:29.000\nWas there anybody that you learned about that you were like and then we got to go?\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:30.000\nDo you have anybody that you like?\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nWe're like, I didn't know this dude.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:33.000\nThis is incredible.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nLike GPS is a black woman.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:41.000\nWell, style wise, I like Langston Hughes, but he's got to be a person who I learned the least amount about because he's a\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:44.000\npoet and I didn't like read any of his poetry.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:47.000\nBut I like that.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:53.000\nI like that there's debate about his sexuality and like that it's like it's none of your business.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:58.000\nYou know, and then he like he dressed fancy and he was just like he was positive.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:05.000\nHis quotes were like, like, hey, if the white man is happy with the colored man.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nSorry for my own fashionable language.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:12.000\nThat's great.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:15.000\nIf he's not, can't do nothing about that.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:20.000\nLike, you know, if the black man is happy with the black man, terrific bonus gravy.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:24.000\nIf he's not, hey, you know, it's like this kind of like that.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:35.000\nIt was I like, I like that guy because it was like he like that's what I need in my like life right now is like overcoming approval addiction.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:41.000\nAnd like the Harlem Renaissance was like like about like I think I'm in my own Harlem Renaissance right now.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nBrandon is what I'm saying.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:44.000\nOkay.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:48.000\nI will fuck with this.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:55.000\nI've got I've been emancipated from a certain tax bracket and I've like done a great migration up to the urban centers of.\n\n17:55.000 --> 18:00.000\nSo all you need now is a gold chain.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:05.000\nI'm going to invent new ways to walk.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:08.000\nI'm going to write poems about nothing but rivers.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:18.000\nI'm going to give a shit if anyone gets it and people can just speculate about where I put my dick.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:22.000\nI like that people are like, oh, he's clearly gay, which is pretty important to the gay people.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:25.000\nIf he was gay and he was in the closet, then it's important that he was in the closet.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:26.000\nWhy was he in the closet, etc.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:29.000\nThat's important to current things.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:34.000\nSo, you know, you don't detract from that, but it's also just kind of funny.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:38.000\nWell, you say because he really, really, really respected black men.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:39.000\nSo he was there.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:40.000\nThere's like, come on, look at this.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:47.000\nLook at this thing he wrote about the regalness of the black man or whatever.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:50.000\nLike, wow, that's some gay stuff.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:54.000\nLike kind of like that's that's fucked up.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nYou know, you're right there.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nIt's like interesting.\n\n18:58.000 --> 18:59.000\nLike, yeah.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:03.000\nSo, so, yeah, I think I guess that's my hero right now.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nAll right.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nLangston Hughes.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.000\nBut I really should read something he wrote.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:08.000\nYou'd love it.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nYou'd love it.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:11.000\nYeah.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:14.000\nAnd dust off a little James Baldwin as well, because you would love James Baldwin.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.000\nJames Baldwin.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:16.000\nTwo L's.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:20.000\nOne L, one T, but Baldwin.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:23.000\nYou would love James Baldwin.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:24.000\nAll right.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:27.000\nWell, let's, I mean, like as if by magic.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:33.000\nRob, what do you have to say about black history?\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:38.000\nI like Candy Man.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:44.000\nNow there's a great documentary called on shutter called Horror Noir that goes through\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:49.000\nlike the history of black cinema in the horror genre.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nThat's actually really, really good.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:52.000\nKeith David's in it.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:53.000\nHe's fantastic.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nTony Todd, Candy Man is in it.\n\n19:55.000 --> 20:02.000\nWhat is the, what is the, what's the, the, what do we glean about the connection between\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nblackness and horror?\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nLike, what's the special relationship?\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:07.000\nWell.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:08.000\nYeah.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:09.000\nWell.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:10.000\nSee you.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:11.000\nSee you.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:17.000\nWell, when they start off with like the, like these.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nThe horrible shit.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:24.000\nWell, when they start off with like Birth of a Nation is like a horror film for black\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:25.000\npeople.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:30.000\nIt's just like, this is terrifying because it was incredibly popular and it just, it\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nwas shown for that.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:37.000\nIt's kind of started all these horrible stereotypes that we still see to this day.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:41.000\nWell, the idea of being, what is the deal with the idea of being scared of ghosts and\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:42.000\nstuff?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:43.000\nLike what's that?\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:44.000\nWho isn't afraid of ghosts?\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nYeah.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:46.000\nExactly.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:53.000\nI guess, I guess white people think it's hilarious that black people are also afraid of ghosts.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nDo you think it's like Doth protest too much?\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nLike we're scared of black power.\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:01.000\nAnd so we're like, make them scared, make them more scared of ghosts.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:05.000\nI do think there's this thing about scaring the thing that scares you.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:09.000\nWell, that they touch on that in this documentary is like, they go through like, well, first\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:12.000\nit was like Birth of a Nation where it was vilified.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:19.000\nAnd then, then the black, the black actor in like, I don't know, like Bella the ghost\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:25.000\nhe meets a Brooklyn gorilla or whatever, and then like there's the terrible stereotype\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:29.000\nthat he's a fool and idiot to somebody that you laugh at.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:33.000\nAnd then as we go through into the 80s, when we get to like From Beyond and Ken Forree\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\ngoing, I used to play pro football.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:36.000\nAnd we were all crazy.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:37.000\nWe were all crazy.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:43.000\nBack then, you know, like he set up to be like this unstoppable X linebacker cop that\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:47.000\nwhen the monster takes that guy down, now we know it's for real.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:48.000\nRight.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nAnd they go through that like that.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:55.000\nIt's always to serve the white protagonist to be the magic.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nNow hold on a second doc.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:58.000\nYeah.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:04.000\nAre you telling me these wombats from outer space are some kind of vampire wombat?\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:05.000\nYeah.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:06.000\nReal good.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:09.000\nBut they even they even skirted skirted a problematic line there.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nBut I think I nailed it.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:13.000\nBut there was like when there is like a big shift.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:16.000\nI think we're all afraid of vampire wombats.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:22.000\nBut that role of the black, the black, the black, the black man stepping out from the\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:26.000\ncorner during the explainer scene in a horror movie of like what we're up against.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:31.000\nLike the scientist is like, so basically an atomic chain reaction will happen.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:34.000\nSo now hold on doc in English.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:40.000\nAre you saying the more these boogins attack us, the stronger they get.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nThat's exactly it.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:45.000\nTyler and then Tyler just recedes into shadow.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:48.000\nHis job finished.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:49.000\nBoogins.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nOkay.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nSorry about that.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:53.000\nFucking we got to script that.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:56.000\nThere's a horror movie called The Boogins.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:57.000\nIf not, we should.\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:59.000\nWe got to make that.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:03.000\nAnd that's what you would get if you would be underground too long.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:05.000\nYou get the boogins.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nAin't no tissue underground.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:12.000\nBut you know we skipped over a course night of the living dead, which is like the more\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:16.000\nlike so far it's like not only ahead of its time, but then not heated where it's\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:20.000\nlike this big this low budget horror movie just like stakes its claim and goes like\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:23.000\nthey think talk about night of the living dead a lot is like this.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:27.000\nThat movie came out that must have been a racist nightmare because you have Dwayne\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:31.000\nDwayne Jones is like slapping the shit out of a white people killing white\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:32.000\nzombies.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:37.000\nJust like he's just telling like it's just it's highly recommended.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:38.000\nIt's really, really good.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:39.000\nBut it's such resonant horror.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nThat's the thing.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:45.000\nAnd then we continue to do that with the zombie medium, not necessarily being kind\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:49.000\nof a honestly aggressive about racial politics.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nFor instance, we don't necessarily carry that tradition.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:57.000\nBut what we've identified as the attraction of the zombie medium is that it traps the\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nliving under a microscope.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:05.000\nIt makes them have to deal with shit that we are already dealing with but are refusing\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:06.000\nto confront.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:11.000\nAnd but, you know, anyways, all right, we've made our guest way too long.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:15.000\nHe's a professor of African American women's poetry at Howard University.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:22.000\nNo, he's not.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:25.000\nHe's just a gangly white kid with a show on adult swim.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:38.000\nPlease welcome Brian Weissel-Mersky.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\nThis couch looks so comfortable.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:45.000\nI love it that this you're using like the comfortable furniture as decoration.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:49.000\nAnd a guest comes out and sits on this.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:50.000\nThat is a nice couch.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:51.000\nYeah.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nYou're looking real sharp, man.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:54.000\nLooking real good.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:56.000\nI'm not Justin Roiland.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:57.000\nNo.\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:00.000\nWell, did anyone promote that Justin was going to be on the show?\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nOh, that was their mistake.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nI saw that coming.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:12.000\nJustin texted me at like fucking 3.30, like, I ate an edible at one.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:13.000\nWhat's happening?\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:16.000\nI thought it would be over by now.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nMy hands are getting so big.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nI can't understand what.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nWhat am I? Who are you?\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:25.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:30.000\nI called Postmates and they came and I just let them drive away.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:33.000\nThat's how high I am.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:36.000\nLike he's like, like, like this is a sympathetic.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nOh, baby.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nAre you okay?\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\nI'm in somebody's house.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:44.000\nI don't know how I got here.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:50.000\nI was, I was just saying in the green room, I was like, like, you know, like, like, like,\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:55.000\nyou ever like, you have, you have friends and like you predict their bad behavior.\n\n25:55.000 --> 26:00.000\nAnd then if you predict it, you could get like super pissed at them.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:04.000\nAnd it just struck me today while texting with Justin, who I knew two weeks ago was\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:07.000\nnot going to show up tonight.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:12.000\nAnd I only didn't know the excuse would be eating an edible.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:16.000\nI didn't text him today because I feared that.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:19.000\nBut I'm happy to be here.\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:20.000\nI'm excited.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:23.000\nI mean, you're a swell guy.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nYou'll be fine.\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nImagine being him right now.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:31.000\nSo, you know, but that's, we were getting them on your side a little bit.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:34.000\nI, I pounded a drink backstage when I found out.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:36.000\nWell, you should quit the show then.\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nYou should just bail entirely.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nYou took a chemical.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:43.000\nGet out of here.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:46.000\nThat's the responsible thing to do.\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:51.000\nNow Whitesville is like a genius that started a channel one on one and did like the most\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:56.000\namazing cartoons, just some of the funniest, most messed up stuff.\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nI always loved it.\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nAnd is that my popcorn?\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:01.000\nNo.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:02.000\nOkay.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:06.000\nSteve Levy, ladies and gentlemen, Steve Levy.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:09.000\nAnd now you're on your second season of Hot Streets.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:10.000\nFuck.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:11.000\nI'm so sorry.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:12.000\nFuck.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:15.000\nHaving a goddamn panic attack.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:16.000\nWeed.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:17.000\nNobody's ever died from weed.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:18.000\nDon't worry.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:19.000\nI'm so itchy.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:22.000\nWhitesville is going to be so bummed too.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:23.000\nThis is a mess.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:27.000\nI never usually do weed anymore, but I just felt so uncreative.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nAnd usually it helps me with that.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nBut I guess not this stuff.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:39.000\nWhat can I do to help?\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.000\nYou don't have to do anything.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:44.000\nThat's why you texted to get permission to bail.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:45.000\nYou got it.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:48.000\nYou don't have to feel bad about it, but I'm not going to figure out how to make you\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nfeel great.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nI understand.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:58.000\nI feel like Mike Tyson is punching my heart.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\nI'm sorry for letting you down, Harmon.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:04.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:08.000\nI can't believe I have to talk to Weiss all by himself.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:09.000\nI am.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:10.000\nYes.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:11.000\nSo we were at channel one on one.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:12.000\nThat's where you started this.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nPlease tell us more about it.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:15.000\nYeah.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:22.000\nWell, I feel actually nostalgic sitting here with Dan and Rob because I think a lot of\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:26.000\npeople's stories that got involved with channel one on one, I think a lot of people were in\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:29.000\nsome sort of a personal despair.\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:37.000\nSo I was very at a place, a breaking point in my life where I wasn't getting where I\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:38.000\nwanted to be.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nCan we just have two details?\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.000\nTwo details.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nWipe your ass with a T-shirt.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:46.000\nWell, one detail is first, I lived in Irvine.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nThat's not a good detail.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:51.000\nI mean, if you live in Irvine, that's not a good detail.\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nShout out to Irvine.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:55.000\nShout out to Irvine Company.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:59.000\nIs that inland?\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nJesus, it's Orange County.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:02.000\nIt's like...\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:03.000\nLike Juggaloo's.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:04.000\nYeah.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:05.000\nYeah.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.000\nYeah.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:07.000\nWhy would you add...\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:10.000\nLike, that's going to really make the story better.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:11.000\nIs it inland?\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:12.000\nYes.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:13.000\nOh.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:14.000\nOh.\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:15.000\nOh.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:18.000\nOh, my God.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:19.000\nWow.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nSo many colors.\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.000\nAnd music.\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nIt's inland.\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:26.000\nOh, my God.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:33.000\nIf I take a flyer out of the idea that I don't belong up here, can we stop investigating\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:34.000\nthat?\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:35.000\nI know I'm a bad interviewer.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:36.000\nIs it inland?\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:37.000\nIs it inland?\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nDid anybody think that?\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:40.000\nIs that inland?\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:41.000\nNobody.\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:42.000\nI just...\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:43.000\nNobody was questioning.\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:44.000\nAh.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:45.000\nAh, is it...\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:46.000\nIs it...\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:47.000\nI guess what I meant was...\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:48.000\nOutlander inland.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:49.000\nYou got to give me some more, buddy.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nI don't know what planet I'm on.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:52.000\nWhat year is it?\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:53.000\nI mean, Jesus Christ.\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:54.000\nI mean, come on.\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:55.000\nIs it Tuesday?\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:56.000\nCan I get prize with that?\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:57.000\nCome on.\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:58.000\nIs it inland or what?\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:03.000\nI imagine Grand Theft Auto 5.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.000\nIs it in the neighborhood that...\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:06.000\nWhat's his name?\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nIs it in the guy that stops the guy's head?\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:09.000\nIs it in the...\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:10.000\nYou know, there's like your...\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:11.000\nRight.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nThe GTA game where you're the three guys.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nYou know, one of them is one of them...\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:16.000\nWhat's the second detail?\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:17.000\nIs that like a...\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nThe bald guy?\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:20.000\nThe creepy guy?\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:21.000\nYeah.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:22.000\nHey, come on.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:23.000\nHey, what the fuck?\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:24.000\nI'm getting there.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:25.000\nI'm getting there, so...\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nSo, what's detail number two?\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nOh, geez.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:32.000\nWatch me make this podcast great by not interrupting.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:37.000\nWell, this detail for me was bad, but it's not necessarily...\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:41.000\nLike, I feel bad because, like, I was working in property management.\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:44.000\nFor me, it's not the job for me.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:47.000\nSo, like, I'm not putting down the job.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:50.000\nIt's just like I hated my job and I hated my life.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:57.000\nI was living in Irvine and I did not feel like I was surrounded by similar types of people,\n\n30:57.000 --> 31:01.000\ncreative people, and I wanted to be a writer that wasn't working out.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:05.000\nI wanted to get into MFA programs that wasn't working out.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:13.000\nSo, one day I got really high and I was watching Adult Swim, and I've always been a fan of Adult Swim,\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:23.000\nand I saw that only two people had animated Aquatine Hunger Force,\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:29.000\nso then I researched animation software and I just taught myself how to animate.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:38.000\nAnd when I found Channel 101, I became a fan of a lot of the creators, like Twiggers and...\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nAnd the old baby fucker over here.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:41.000\nOh, Daryl.\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:44.000\nCome on, we just got out of that drama.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nThere's no out of it.\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nSo, you taught yourself how to animate.\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:53.000\nYes, I taught myself how to animate by kind of tracing old cartoons.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nWhat was your first software?\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:59.000\nIt was called Digicel, it was really bad, it was really unintuitive,\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:04.000\nand I was watching Channel 101, I was a fan of the content,\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:09.000\nand I wanted to be a writer, but I was a fiction writer,\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:16.000\nand the thing that sucks about being a writer is nobody wants to read what you're writing.\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:22.000\nSo, if you make something that you can watch, you know, that is a lot more entertaining.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:29.000\nSo, I taught myself how to animate, and what was cool is I was living in Orange County,\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:37.000\nand I felt a bit lonely, and I began submitting to Channel 101, and I felt...\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nWhat was your first show, do you remember?\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:42.000\nOh my god, it's terrible, it was called Space Goblins.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:43.000\nOh yes.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:47.000\nAnd I think, I believe, am I mistaken in that, like, people, when that came out,\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:50.000\npeople were like, this is the downfall of Channel 101.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:53.000\nI think we said that a lot about a lot of stuff.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nThere's been a lot of downfall.\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:58.000\nChannel 101 was like, I mean, I always liken it to punk rock,\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:02.000\nI mean, that's probably flattering us culturally, but like, relative to what we were doing,\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:06.000\na bunch of nerds making short films, it was always punk rock,\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:09.000\nso that meant that people, it's like, well, who's doing what next?\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:12.000\nOh, this guy just threw his own shit at the audience,\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:17.000\nand you're like, so every single month, it was like, well, that's it then,\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:21.000\nthen now Channel 101's jump the shark, and then someone else would say,\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:25.000\nno, it's just beginning, and everyone was wrong.\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nIt was just a great place for people to...\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nHow many shows did you do at 101?\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:30.000\nCan you name them all?\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:35.000\nOh my god, no, probably about, I think, probably at least 10 to 15, I think.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:39.000\nHow many of those got picked up for more than one episode?\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:42.000\nIt's funny because like, Channel 101, there's a trajectory,\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:48.000\nusually there's, you begin submitting, you get rejected, you get better.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:53.000\nI felt that I was getting better, and what was cool is because like,\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:57.000\nyou're competing against your friends, which is cool about Channel 101,\n\n33:57.000 --> 34:00.000\nis you respect the people that you're up against,\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:02.000\nand you want to make something really good,\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:07.000\nand I kept trying to make something better, but I think I became...\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nIt was always a win-win.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:13.000\nAlso, I'm sure all animation shared this,\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:21.000\nyou and Justin and Siobhan and the guys, the animation crews,\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:25.000\nthey suffered always the same kind of curse,\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:30.000\nwhich is that you guys are animators, so you're weirder,\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:35.000\nand so you're making shit that's even more off the hinge a little bit,\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:40.000\nand people would tend to purposely not vote for stuff\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:43.000\nbecause they could tell from watching something,\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nthat guy's not going anywhere.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:48.000\nHe's going to be back here with a new pilot next month.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nI always voted like that.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nI don't know if I ever voted for anything you did.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nAnd Justin too.\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:57.000\nJustin would come in with something, it would just be called Skin Scrapers.\n\n34:57.000 --> 35:00.000\nHi, I'm Johnny Skin Scrape.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:03.000\nUh-oh, I'm going to scrape my skin now.\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nOh, the skin's off.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:08.000\nOh, hey, hey, what are you doing with that skin?\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:09.000\nI'm going to eat it.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nOh, no, he's eating my skin.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nOh, no, oh, no.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:16.000\nAnd the audience would just be like, this is the fucking best.\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:18.000\nFuck you, mom and dad.\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nFuck you, gym teacher.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:23.000\nFuck you, Jimmy Carter, whoever was president.\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:24.000\nJimmy Carter.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:25.000\nWhat?\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nShout out to Sprinkles.\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:35.000\nBut it was really like, it was like, fuck you, CAA, fuck you, UTA, fuck you, casting directors, fuck you, system.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:43.000\nI came out here with a steamer trunk from the Midwest or Irvine and I'm ready to work\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:47.000\nand you would have me just sit out here and put a gun in my mouth\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:52.000\nand you deserve what you're seeing on screen right now.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:57.000\nThat was the real joy and I would never vote for Justin's stuff.\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nI wanted him to make a new pilot.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:03.000\nSo how many shows did you make by yourself?\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:10.000\nHow many shows did you make before you got picked up?\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:11.000\nHow many pilots did you make?\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:15.000\nNot very many because a lot of people's trajectory was that they would start a channel 101,\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:20.000\nthey would get better and I felt that I was getting better but not getting voted in.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:24.000\nWas it past the pigs?\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:27.000\nThat was your House of Cosby's.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:31.000\nHouse of Cosby's was successful.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:34.000\nNo, past the pigs got voted back several times.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:35.000\nWas that the first one?\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nNo, I got invited back once.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:42.000\nWas that Hot Cross Buns?\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:45.000\nThat didn't get voted back but I thought that was a really good one.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:52.000\nI made this video called Hot Cross Buns and I thought that it was really good.\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:58.000\nLet's talk about the relationship between this willful stupidity.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:06.000\nWhat I like about you and Justin is that I get caught in spirals of overthought.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:09.000\nIt's the death of all fun things and stuff.\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:17.000\nMy heroes like Schrab, Royland, you're carrying that torch.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:21.000\nI'm fascinated by you guys and therefore I never want to ask you questions\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:24.000\nbecause I feel like I'll just soil you with overthought.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:30.000\nWait, is that bad on purpose?\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:31.000\nDon't ask that question.\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:34.000\nWhat is the difference for you?\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:37.000\nDo you make decisions and go like, I'm going to make this a little shittier?\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:43.000\nWell, I think that's funny because that's never quite my purpose\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:44.000\nis to make something shittier.\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:45.000\nI think he's trying to do it.\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:47.000\nDon't high road me in front of these people.\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:51.000\nYou know your style is obviously very organic.\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:56.000\nSo when you made this macaroni cheese, you thought I'll just add these fucking raisins.\n\n37:56.000 --> 38:01.000\nYou were like, I'm going to paint this wall and then I'll just smear some shit on it.\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nIs that how you do it?\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:07.000\nWell, I think it's funny because the Hot Street season one came out\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:11.000\nand people were saying that the animation is bad on purpose.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:15.000\nBut I was really working hard on a small budget.\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nSo it's funny.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:21.000\nBut you know, they're not talking about the quality of the animation.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:24.000\nThey're talking about the blocking, the choreography.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:26.000\nYou surely must...\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:27.000\nMaybe you're not.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:28.000\nMaybe you're David Lynch.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:29.000\nYou don't know that you're weird.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:30.000\nIs that what we're learning?\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:32.000\nYou don't know you're weird?\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:34.000\nI don't know that I'm weird.\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\nAll right. Well, that's it. I'm glad I asked.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.000\nI'm a good interviewer. I'm glad I interrupted.\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:40.000\nAll right. Okay.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nBut it's like, I remember like Space Goblins.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:44.000\nIt was like, I mean, we were rolling on the floor.\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:47.000\nThere was like a process where we watched the submissions\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:51.000\nand it would be like everybody who won from last month would be in charge of like\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nwho their competitors were basically.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:59.000\nAnd so we'd screen all these analog tapes that would be dropped in our mailbox.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nAnd I remember Space Goblins.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nI remember the introduction to your style,\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:06.000\nwhich was like characters that are going like,\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:09.000\nlike they're walking into frame.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:13.000\nAnd you use the tinkle-toes sound effect from Hanna-Barbera.\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:15.000\nAnd then someone goes,\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:18.000\nmy name is John Spaceman.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:20.000\nI'm going to go do this now.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:23.000\nAnd then like, and then, yeah, like I kind of like,\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nI would call like the Doug Lucen Hope camp,\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:28.000\nlike the, you know, the editor from Tim and Eric,\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:34.000\nit's like that just pre-millennial like fucking like\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:37.000\nlate Beastie Boy's lateral absurdity.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nSee, I overanalyze shit.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nAnd you're like, I'm just trying to,\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nmy heart is to do something from the heart.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:46.000\nAnd then everyone's like, Harmon's fucking evil.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:49.000\nHe called that guy weird.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nBut you're just, you know, you're making,\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nyou know, it's funny that the guy's like,\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:56.000\nthat's not, that the guy's like,\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\nthis is the name of the show.\n\n39:58.000 --> 39:59.000\nGive me back my baby.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:00.000\nWhat was the...\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:02.000\nOh, Bearded Traveler.\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:03.000\nBearded Traveler.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:05.000\nBut he was, he was, he was like,\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\nit was like the title sequence was like,\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:09.000\nand then he would say, give me back my baby.\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:10.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:11.000\nThat was his catchphrase.\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:12.000\nAnd it was like a show about a guy\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:14.000\nwho just wanted his baby back.\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:15.000\nYeah.\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:16.000\nBearded Traveler is my favorite.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:17.000\nAnd that was it.\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:18.000\nBut give me back my baby.\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:19.000\nWhat was nice is like when I made,\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:20.000\nI made the, I made that show.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:23.000\nAnd actually Justin emailed me\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\non the Channel 101 forums.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:28.000\nI met him before to animate Doc and Marty.\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nBut I was working on the, on that show,\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:31.000\non that Channel 101 show.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:32.000\nOoh.\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:34.000\nOoh.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:35.000\nThat's a bitch.\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:36.000\nBet you're kicking yourself.\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:38.000\nBet you're kicking yourself.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:39.000\nBecause the guy's that anime.\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:42.000\nAnd look at the Bearded Traveler now.\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:43.000\nBearded Traveler is amazing.\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:44.000\nYeah.\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:46.000\nI like the Bearded Traveler.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:49.000\nAnd you were very nice to me because I...\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:50.000\nWhat's that like?\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.000\nI met the, what?\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:54.000\nAfter I met, I met,\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:57.000\nI think I met Dan before I met Rob.\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nBut after the Bearded Traveler screened,\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:02.000\nyou came up to me and you said that you,\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:04.000\nyou thought that like I had a unique style\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:05.000\nand it meant a lot to me.\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nSo I, I just...\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\nYou've got a unique style.\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nNo, I think you, well you, I mean,\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:13.000\nyou said that you thought that I could eventually\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nhave a TV show.\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:16.000\nI was right.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:17.000\nWhy are you laughing at that?\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:18.000\nI know.\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:19.000\nWell because I said,\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nI just had like a fucking cockbacker.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\nI got a unique style.\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:26.000\nI just pictured me in like a crown and a robe.\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:30.000\nI was like, you have a unique style, boy.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:33.000\nHe said, he said it meant a lot to him.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:34.000\nJust take it.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:35.000\nI know.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:38.000\nNo, I wasn't taking it away from...\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:39.000\nOh no.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:40.000\nBy making...\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:42.000\nHe doesn't even know.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:43.000\nHe doesn't even know.\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:46.000\nWhat you think he's gonna say now?\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\nOf course, of course he's gonna be like,\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:51.000\nI'm fine, Mr. Harmon.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:55.000\nIt's like you just threw me and Joe Green's jersey back at him.\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nThis dude comes in and he says,\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nyou said something nice to me and you go,\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:04.000\nI was right.\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:09.000\nDid I mention my dick?\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nWe're probably not, by the way,\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:14.000\nlike, by the way, this is Weissall.\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:15.000\nDo you go by Weissall now?\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:16.000\nIs that like your prince name?\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:19.000\nWell, that's a good question because all throughout,\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:24.000\nI mean, I've always introduced myself as Brian\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:28.000\nand people call me Weissall, which is fine.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:30.000\nWhen I was a child, when I was a kid,\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:32.000\npeople would call me Weissall.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\nIn the Rick and Morty's writer's room,\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:36.000\nI would be called Weissall.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:40.000\nI think what it was is that Cass,\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:43.000\nwhich was my friend in my Channel 101,\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nthe guy who had cast in all of my shows\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:48.000\nin the early Channel 101 days, called me Weissall.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:50.000\nIntroduced me to everybody as Weissall,\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:54.000\nbut I always feel really self-conscious about that.\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:55.000\nIt feels like branding.\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:59.000\nYeah, like, I'm Speed Demon Johnson.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:02.000\nMy name is Brian, but please call me Speed Demon.\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:03.000\nRight, right.\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:06.000\nI always feel really uncomfortable about that,\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:09.000\nbut if you call me Weissall, I like it.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:12.000\nIt's fine, but I also go by Brian.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:19.000\nAnd the show we're plugging is Hot Streets on Adult Swim.\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nIt already had a first season.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:22.000\nIt had a first season.\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:25.000\nJesus Christ, they'll run anything.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:28.000\nI haven't even seen this fucking thing,\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:29.000\nbut I know one thing for sure.\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nIt's got a guy doing tinkle toes\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:35.000\nand something you're going to pretend isn't weird on purpose.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nIt's a good show.\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:42.000\nSo you got picked up for a second season.\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:45.000\nYes, you got picked up for a second season.\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:49.000\nI'll really have to sit down and watch Atlanta,\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:50.000\nand then watch this.\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\nI used your story circle.\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:57.000\nYeah, that's always so evident.\n\n43:57.000 --> 44:00.000\nI'm really proud of the second season of the show.\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:06.000\nSo how do you get it from Channel 101 to Adult Swim?\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:07.000\nYeah, I'd like to know.\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nShow us that ladder.\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:12.000\nKate Freund, who is married to Rob Schrobb.\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:13.000\nGross.\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:14.000\nShout out to Kate.\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:16.000\nShout out to Kate.\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:17.000\nBrave woman.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nShe...\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nWe wish her luck tonight.\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:25.000\nShe passed my name to some people\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:29.000\nthat was able to get me...\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:34.000\nThis is really weird because I got my break on Smosh.\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:36.000\nChoke up just a little bit.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:37.000\nI'm sorry?\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:38.000\nThank you.\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:39.000\nOh, yeah, got it.\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:40.000\nThank you.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:41.000\nYes, Smosh.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:42.000\nSmosh.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:44.000\nKate gave my name to some producers,\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:46.000\nand I got the attention of Smosh.\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:47.000\nDo you know what Smosh is?\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:48.000\nWhat is Smosh?\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:49.000\nSmosh?\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:51.000\nWhat's it called?\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:55.000\nIt's getting more marketing than Adult Swim tonight.\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nWell, like Smosh?\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:58.000\nSmosh?\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:02.000\nTen years ago, it was like the premier destination\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:05.000\nfor teen and tween entertainment,\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:11.000\nand honestly, I had made fun of them for a long time\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:14.000\nbecause I didn't think they were funny at all,\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:17.000\nand they gave me my break,\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:25.000\nand it turns out that they were really cool, nice people,\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:28.000\nand I feel really bad, but...\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:30.000\nYeah.\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:33.000\nAll right, so we meet people at Smosh.\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:36.000\nThey love you, and then how does that go to Adult Swim?\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:42.000\nIt went from the people at Smosh got me a management\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nand all that kind of thing,\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:49.000\nand then I was already friends with Justin, of course,\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:55.000\nso my management team connected me with Stupid Buddy\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:58.000\nwho makes robot chicken,\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:01.000\nand then we flew.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:05.000\nJustin, Seth Green, and all of the robot chicken people,\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:09.000\nwe all flew out to Atlanta and pitched it directly to Adult Swim,\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:10.000\nwhich is pretty cool.\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:11.000\nIncredible.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nThe Wrecking Crew, that's what I call you guys.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nYou, Seth Green, and Justin.\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:16.000\nThere goes the Wrecking Crew.\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:20.000\nThe Wrecking Crew.\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:26.000\nWeisel, have you heard about this conspiracy theory\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nthat Donald Trump is a time traveler?\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:31.000\nI have not, and I really want to hear about this.\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:32.000\nDan, you just...\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.000\nThis is fresh in your palate, and it's your show.\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:37.000\nWhy don't you explain?\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nAll right, well, there's this author.\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:42.000\nThere's a YouTube video that's like an hour.\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:45.000\nSo you know it's for real?\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:48.000\nYeah.\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:55.000\nIt's called The Last President.\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:59.000\nThe Last President, what a 127-year-old book reveals\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:04.000\nabout Donald Trump time travel and Nikola Tesla.\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:07.000\nAnd I'm only like 20 minutes into it,\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:10.000\nbut it's like there was a book by an author called...\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:11.000\nWhat's his name?\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:12.000\nEngelsack Humper Nut?\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\nHumper Nut.\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:17.000\nEngelsack Humper Nut.\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:20.000\nSome guy wrote a book in like 1896.\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:24.000\nHe wrote a series of books about a character,\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:27.000\na bratty little kid called Baron Trump,\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:32.000\nwho he's like a privileged son of like a dynasty,\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:33.000\nand he...\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nHis father's name is Don.\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\nWell, his mentor is the Don.\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:38.000\nOh, okay, all right.\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:43.000\nBut the Baron Trump in his second book,\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:47.000\nwhich is called 1900, The Future...\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:48.000\nThe Last President.\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:51.000\nThe Last President.\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:54.000\nBaron Trump becomes president.\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:57.000\nAnd one of his cabinet members is named Pence.\n\n47:57.000 --> 48:03.000\nAnd Baron Trump in the book goes to Russia,\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:08.000\nwhere there's caves that lead to the center of the earth,\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:12.000\nwhere there's a secret civilization made of silver.\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:15.000\nThe guy interjects in the YouTube video to talk about,\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:18.000\nby the way, it's worth noting that in these specific caves\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:22.000\nthat are cited in this story, they have found these weird nanofibers\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nthat are like inexplicable and stuff.\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\nLike, I'm going to call this guy...\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nLike, I really don't want to offend this guy,\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:29.000\nbecause I really respect...\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:31.000\nLike, I'm listening to him and I'm like...\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:33.000\nI'm a believer.\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\nI'm a believer, man.\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:40.000\nAnd I also don't want to offend anyone who has any...\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:44.000\nis grappling with any kind of chemical complication.\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:47.000\nI think you just insulted him.\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.000\nWell, no...\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:51.000\nI don't want to insult him. He's all smart.\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:53.000\nI don't want to insult people with brains.\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:55.000\nBut I don't think that the guy is like...\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:58.000\nHe's not like Harrison Ford is like trying to melt my testicles with satellites,\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:01.000\nyou know, because I saw it in the Amway manual.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:04.000\nWhen did Harrison Ford tell us this?\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nYes.\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:09.000\nHe's not like unhealthily like...\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nHe's not diagnosable in any way,\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:13.000\nas far as this YouTube video is concerned.\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:15.000\nHe's like, this guy is like clearly like kind of a hobbyist\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:17.000\ninto this thing.\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:19.000\nYou're saying, no, he's a cuckoo bird.\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:23.000\nNo, no, no. I'm saying go on, continue.\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:25.000\nWell, I just wanted to say,\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:28.000\nbecause I feel weird when I talk about people that I haven't met\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\nand I always want to say to those people,\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nlike if I'm offending you, if this gets back to you,\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:35.000\nyou know, like to come on the show.\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:37.000\nOh, fuck, yeah.\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:40.000\nGet to the testicles.\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.000\nWhoever this guy is, if it somehow gets back to you,\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.000\nas it tends to in the most negative of ways,\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:47.000\nI really am not dogging on you and not making fun of you.\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:50.000\nLike, we're very interested in your YouTube video.\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.000\nIt is crazy.\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:54.000\nI hope that's not offensive to you.\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nBut this book exists, apparently.\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:59.000\nI'm not going to read it, but I'm sure,\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:03.000\napparently, it exists, that it was all this stuff.\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:09.000\nThe Don lives in an apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York,\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:10.000\nwhere Trump is.\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:12.000\nWell, so President Trump goes into the center of the earth,\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:17.000\nin Russia, and he accidentally time-travels\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:19.000\nthrough time, as one does.\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:21.000\nYeah.\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:25.000\nThen that ties into a story that may be apocryphal or not\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:30.000\nabout Nikola Tesla, who one day walked into a tavern, you said?\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nYeah, he walks into a tavern, and he's all messed up.\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:35.000\nHis hair's like crooked, and he's like,\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:38.000\nand a friend's like, no, Tess, man.\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:39.000\nTessy.\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:40.000\nTess, what's going on?\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:41.000\nWhat's going on, brother?\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:45.000\nThere was an accident, and the machine.\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:48.000\nI was able to see past, present, and future all at the same time.\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:51.000\nI think I created a time machine.\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:54.000\nAnd they went, oh, OK.\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:56.000\nSo there's that story that's out there somewhere.\n\n50:56.000 --> 51:02.000\nBut later on, when Tesla died, the FBI came in\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:06.000\nand just took all of his stuff, all of his notes,\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:07.000\nall of his stuff.\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.000\nThey just came in and took it.\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:12.000\nApparently, this is the legend or whatever the conspiracy\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:13.000\nor whatever it is.\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nThey looked through all this stuff, and they go, Bill,\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:16.000\ndo you know what this means?\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:19.000\nNo, I don't know what that means, Nigel.\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:21.000\nAnd then Bill and Nigel were two guys there.\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:22.000\nI love it.\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:23.000\nYeah.\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:24.000\nAnd they didn't know.\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:25.000\nThey couldn't decipher what it was.\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:28.000\nThey said, well, let's get some smart guy to come in here\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:29.000\nand take a look at this.\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:34.000\nAnd the guy they hired was Trump's uncle.\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:39.000\nAs the legend goes.\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:42.000\nAnd so do they have this machine?\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:43.000\nYes.\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:47.000\nWell, the proof is they said that the guy eventually says,\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:48.000\nI think it's that video.\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:54.000\nHe says, well, time travel affects your mind.\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:55.000\nIt screws you up.\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nIt deteriorates your brain.\n\n51:57.000 --> 52:00.000\nAnd that's why Trump talks the way he does.\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.000\nIt's because of time travel.\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:06.000\nAnd that's why he misspelled Barron Trump's name,\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:09.000\nbecause there's two Rs in the book instead of one.\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:15.000\nSo like Donald Trump, we're just watching.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:25.000\nWe're at the end of a world that has been retro pre-destroyed\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:29.000\nby a time-traveling nincompoop who,\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:32.000\nand he probably doesn't even remember\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:33.000\nhow to time travel anymore.\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:34.000\nSo now he's just hanging out.\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:39.000\nSo if Dr. Hoot was an idiot and didn't care about not fucking up time,\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:41.000\nthis is the world we would be living in.\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:50.000\nBecause he kind of explains a lot more than if the stuff didn't exist.\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:54.000\nIt reminds me of the Ford and the Lincoln and the Kennedy thing,\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:55.000\nwhich is...\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:56.000\nWhat's that?\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:59.000\nKennedy was killed in a Lincoln.\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:02.000\nLincoln was killed in Ford's theater.\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:05.000\nBoth had shots to the head.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:09.000\nBoth fucked Marilyn Monroe.\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:12.000\nSomeone had a secretary named Johnson.\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:15.000\nOne had a Johnson named Secretary.\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:19.000\nWell, this is what the conspiracy theorists say,\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:22.000\nthat the Illuminati are the powers to be or whatever,\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:27.000\nthey're putting all these clues being out in the open\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:29.000\nbecause they're arrogant, they're going,\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:32.000\nhere, look, doesn't Biff Tannen look from back to the future?\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:34.000\nThat's like the spackle on the logic of conspiracy theories.\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:37.000\nIt's like, well, why would they, because they're fucking with us.\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:38.000\nYeah, man.\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:42.000\nThank God the Illuminati are always just fucking with everybody.\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:45.000\nOr we wouldn't be able to explain quite all of this.\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nYeah, covers a lot of plot holes.\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:52.000\nI like David, I watch the Illuminati videos where they show\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:58.000\njust a montage of celebrities in moments of mind laps or whatever.\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:00.000\nWhen the reptilian eyes show.\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:03.000\nYeah, or just like the craziness though,\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:06.000\nlike Will Smith's talking and then they go like,\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:08.000\nyeah, but so when's your next movie coming out?\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:12.000\nAnd he just goes like, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:15.000\nAnyway, and they just do that.\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:18.000\nYou just watch 45 minutes of that because,\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:21.000\nbut it's like, it's like, I like, I like, it's like,\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:24.000\nI think that's, that might be a healthier hobby\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:28.000\nfor a middle-aged man than toy trains.\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:32.000\nLike, yeah, think about how the world might be fucked up\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:35.000\nand engineered to manipulate you.\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:39.000\nLike, don't just recede into a Digicell app\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:42.000\nand like try to make a squiggly cartoon.\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:44.000\nAll right, let's get to know you a little bit.\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:45.000\nSo what do you think?\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:46.000\nWhat do you think?\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:47.000\nWhat do you think, Weissal?\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:48.000\nWhat's your take on all this?\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:49.000\nWeissal, come on.\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:52.000\nOh, Brian.\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nI'm going to a new area.\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:56.000\nI'm going to talk about Weiser,\n\n54:56.000 --> 55:01.000\nbecause like I find myself like,\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:04.000\ndo you find yourself just getting really mad?\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:06.000\nAnd you're like, I'm online and I'm like,\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:09.000\nI'm listening to this really bad Africa cover\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:10.000\nand I get really mad.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:11.000\nThat is some bullshit.\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nCan we say that that is some bullshit?\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nYeah, it's some bullshit.\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:18.000\nDon't fucking remake it and take out all the fun.\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:21.000\nSo, yes, it's like, but also at the same time,\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nlike I get really mad at the internet.\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:27.000\nI get really, I just want to rage and like,\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:30.000\nI fucking hate this Africa remake\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:33.000\nand I hate the Rosanna one is even worse.\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:36.000\nAnd I just want to go on the internet\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:39.000\nand just talk about it.\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:41.000\nBut at the same time,\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:44.000\nlike everything has become so black and white\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:46.000\nthat like it's like,\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:48.000\nWeiser fucking sucks.\n\n55:48.000 --> 55:50.000\nThey've never been good.\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:51.000\nAnd then I was like,\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:53.000\nwait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:56.000\nCan you go back to talking about the baby stuff?\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:58.000\nI'm trying to get away from that.\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:02.000\nThey're going to fucking burn the building down.\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:04.000\nAnd then like you're watching,\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:06.000\nand then like I was in my car\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:08.000\nand then the sweater sank out came on.\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:10.000\nI was like, this song's pretty good.\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:13.000\nThey're not like complete shit, you know?\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:15.000\nSo like everything's gray anymore.\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:18.000\nEverything's just like attack or defense.\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:21.000\nAnd also like 15 years from now,\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:25.000\nlike you just don't know,\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:29.000\nlike somehow some way your opinion about Weiser,\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:33.000\nit may somehow like dent you, right?\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:36.000\nOr am I, that's not what you were leading to at all.\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:39.000\nAnd I'm just like stuck in my own like fucking weird world over here.\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:44.000\nWell, I mean, I think I'll continue to dislike Weiser,\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:47.000\nbut it's not that they're completely evil,\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:49.000\nhorrible people that need to be destroyed.\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:52.000\nIt's just they made, they made a song that's\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:56.000\nand maybe an album of several albums that suck really bad,\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:59.000\nbut they're not like evil people.\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:00.000\nOkay.\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:03.000\nWhat is the biggest change for you since this is a weird question,\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:07.000\nbut since you did sort of quickly move up the ranks,\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:10.000\nwhat was the hardest thing to get used to for Dan?\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:13.000\nFor Dan, it was being famous for you.\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:14.000\nWhat is it?\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:15.000\nHe's 48 by the way.\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:17.000\nAnd okay, I'm sorry.\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:21.000\nI'm pretty close to that because we just found out that's feasible,\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:23.000\nbut it took it.\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:24.000\nIt took a little while.\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:26.000\nIt took a while, but then once it started,\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:30.000\nit I'll say like when I got my first job as a writer,\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:33.000\nI was 37 and I was Rick and Jesus Christ.\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:35.000\nYou really are really old.\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:36.000\nYes.\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:37.000\nYeah.\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:40.000\nSo like that was my first job was my first professional writing job was\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:43.000\nRick and Morty and I was 37.\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:49.000\nAnd I think my the, the no matter what age you are,\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:52.000\nwhen you go into a writer's room and you're brand new,\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:54.000\nyou're inside of your head.\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:58.000\nSo I think like you're in the writer's room.\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:02.000\nLike I haven't talked enough today or you get kind of get inside\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:04.000\nyour head too much.\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:07.000\nAnd now toward the end of the season,\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:10.000\nI felt like, all right, I know how to contribute to the show.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:13.000\nAnd now I'm on a show and I worked on a couple of other shows after that.\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:16.000\nAnd then Hot Streets, I'm running the writer's room.\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:20.000\nAnd now I see all the bad habits that I was doing.\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:22.000\nLike, give me one.\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:25.000\nLike, it's like you're waiting for your turn.\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:30.000\nYou're like, somebody is talk is giving an idea and they stop talking.\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:33.000\nYou're like, and then you go backwards five minutes ago.\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:34.000\nCause you're in your head.\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:39.000\nYou're like, all right, if Rick and Morty, like if, if they,\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:44.000\nif they did this, then that was a great pitch, right?\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:48.000\nYou get inside your own head, I think is the problem.\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:54.000\nAnd so when, when I became the show runner for my show,\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:59.000\nI saw that happening with, with, I've seen that happen with other,\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:04.000\nanother, not just, I mean, Jesus, the writers on Hot Streets are incredible.\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:06.000\nSo I'm not, I'm not talking bad about them.\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:09.000\nBut I've worked on other shows since Rick and Morty where like,\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:15.000\nyou see that happening and you want to, I think the key is to just\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:21.000\nsuccumb yourself to the show and to embrace what is happening and to\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:24.000\nbuild up what is happening from other writers.\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:27.000\nYou want to help them because you're the greater good as the show.\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:30.000\nBut when you're a new writer, I think the problem is you get inside\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:33.000\nyour own head and just want to like, I've got my own ideas.\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:35.000\nI want to put my own voice in the show.\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.000\nI think that's okay.\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:43.000\nI, I, I, I envy you if what you are achieving is like an actual exercise\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:46.000\nwhere people are just keeping the shuttlecock in the air.\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:53.000\nAnd so you're not even bothering to like, but, but if that is one extreme\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:57.000\nand the other extreme is nobody listening to anybody and they just have their own ideas,\n\n59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nsomewhere in the middle is kind of like, yeah, as long as you don't\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nshoot down other people's ideas, that's what makes me just go, fuck you.\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nLike, like, like, like that means like, like you're sitting there listening\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nto other people's ideas and trying to figure out why they won't work.\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nDude, ideas don't work because God hates us.\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nWe're here to beat him.\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nLike, like, like, like, like, you're on the wrong side of the law.\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nIf you're sitting here trying to figure out how that person's pitch isn't going to work.\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nI don't care if it's about boogers or fucking whatever.\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nLike, support it until it dies of overindulgence.\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nBut ideas are a gift.\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nBut I think it's okay.\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nI mean, I thought, well, for my money and my shitty writer's room that probably\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:46.000\nworks much slower than yours is like, I don't mind people ratcheting back a little\n\n01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nbit and going like, well, listen to that person talk for four minutes trying to get\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000\ntheir idea out.\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000\nAnd I, but what I wanted to say about what we were talking about is this other thing.\n\n01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nLike, I don't, I just see, you know, I don't, I never saw that as a sin.\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nI would expect that.\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nI don't, I wouldn't want people to leave shit behind in a ditch just because\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nRight.\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nTimothy, like, decided to make everything about Wizard of Oz.\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nI agree with you.\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000\nAnd I would say like ideas are a gift.\n\n01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nBut I felt like when I was working at Rick and Morty, I felt that I would\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nI felt that I was too inside of my head.\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nRight.\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nYou caught yourself not listening to other people enough.\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nRight.\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nThat's what you're saying.\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nRight.\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nAnd when I've worked with people, not just writing, but like, I season two, we were able\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nto kind of, I guess the problem going from season one to season two is season one is\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nI don't quite know how to be, how to run the show.\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nSo I've got certain lieutenants that I'm listening to and\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000\nAnd they're just going to stab you in the back and go do a fucking Marvel show about\n\n01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nLoki.\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nOkay.\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nAll right.\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000\nAll right.\n\n01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nOh my God.\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000\nBe happy for your friends for once.\n\n01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nBe happy.\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nWe're all fucking trying to figure it out.\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nSomebody did something nice happens to somebody and you, you got to tear them down.\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nYou got to tear them apart.\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nWhat's wrong with you?\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000\nI just said.\n\n01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nWaldron was there for two weeks.\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000\nI like I got it.\n\n01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000\nI got it.\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000\nI got it.\n\n01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nI got to train people slower.\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000\nMy God.\n\n01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000\nI got the fire.\n\n01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nHe did the work.\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000\nHe got the job.\n\n01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000\nBe happy for him.\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000\nWhat?\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nDon't high road me.\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nHow dare you?\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nNo one's happier for him than me.\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000\nYou know a little bit because you're running your second season, right?\n\n01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nThat's that's going to be you show running deep.\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nWhat would you tell him?\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nBecause it's a.\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nWhat would I tell?\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nWho?\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000\nLow key low key.\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nOh, what would you tell Brian?\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000\nBecause he took sense.\n\n01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nYou tell him anything.\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000\nWell, he just said he's not so sure.\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nIs there a piece because I like it's cool about this show is that you do talk about the process\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000\nand I do think people want to know how it all gets made sometimes.\n\n01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nYeah, but it's I mean it's a goddamn nightmare.\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nI for me the central thing about it is always the wondering when you're supposed to be overthinking\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nand when you're supposed to be under thinking, especially in a show like Rick and Morty where\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nit's like, you know, to me very clear that it's the key recipe is that it's a swirl of\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:31.000\ntwo things that don't usually work well together, which is like willful stupidity and an absolute\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000\nlike passionate like over thought.\n\n01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nAnd I so we sit in the writer's room and we we I don't know we try to break stories,\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000\nbut we also like have these at the top of every season we go.\n\n01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nLet's do things real differently this time around.\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nYou know, let's let's let's escape this process and let's do another one.\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nIt's just this because two to three was a whole different room.\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nYeah, I mean they're always they're always they're always real different rooms and your\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nit's everything's the experiment is never over.\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nYou're never comfortable.\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000\nYou're never nailing it.\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nYou never it's like you just dream of this day.\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nIt's like the myth of retirement like the myth of the writer's room that like has its shit together\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nwhere you're like, OK, well, we know what our job is.\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nWe make pizza, right?\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000\nPeople like the cheese like the tomato sauce.\n\n01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nOh shit, all of the unexpected things have to do with our babies and medical emergencies.\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nI got to go home at four instead of five.\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nIt never happens.\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nIt's always like, OK, you're you're behind schedule.\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nAnd and why did this story about a banana peel turn out to be our citizen cane or ishtar?\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nLike what what are we doing wrong?\n\n01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:50.000\nIt's funny because like whatever brings you like joy in the room like for us, we were in our writer's room.\n\n01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:58.000\nMan, I don't know how to talk about this, but like I guess there's this.\n\n01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:10.000\nThere's this sexual fetish of people liking like cartoon horses like party party party on people's faces.\n\n01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nWe're all hanging in every word waiting for you to the joke is bringing it back to the thing that everybody.\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nWhat's that?\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nWhat's the term?\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000\nWhat's like if I wanted to Google?\n\n01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nIt's not what I mean.\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nIt's like, you know, we in our room, we were watching like for us, like you just follow whatever the joy is of the moment.\n\n01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nFor us and I like horses.\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000\nYeah, but cartoon horses are even better.\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:46.000\nIf you like, you know, if you are aroused by my little ponies farting in faces, that's totally cool.\n\n01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000\nBut like it's some fetishes are kind of amusing at the same time.\n\n01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000\nLike what?\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nLike the ponies farting in faces.\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nAlso, Pokemon is a big on the farting on people.\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:12.000\nSo like the videos start with like either the my little pony or or the Pokemon slowly approaching backwards to the create to the character.\n\n01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nRight.\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nAnd I feel like they start with a lot of self hate.\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nGet up on that mic.\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nSo tell us about that room.\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nTell us about that room.\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nSo we're like, we have to write an episode, but it has to be serious.\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nLike if the pony farts in your face, you die.\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nSo it's like the things that make you laugh in the room oftentimes will help create that story.\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nYeah.\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000\nCompletely went away from what we were talking about.\n\n01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nYeah.\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nI mean, look, I it's a conversation about a thing that is so frustrating for the same reason that it's like the conversation about it is almost tedious, let alone inaccessible, because it's like, that's the problem.\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nAnd I've always agonized about this because I'm like, hopefully going to retire soon.\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:14.000\nAnd I spent my life working, I'm going to go ahead and say it as hard as a carpenter works with wood.\n\n01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nBut with stories.\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nOh, fuck you people.\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000\nNo, but I mean, like I've said it over and over again.\n\n01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nIt's like the fucked up thing is that from the from the beginning of the first moment when two people got to two pieces of wood and said, let's make a porch.\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:38.000\nLike the first time don't don't act like I don't know architecture.\n\n01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nThe first time that they figured out is just two pieces.\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000\nThey're going to start on the porch Brandon.\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000\nYou don't.\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000\nThat's the fucking steps.\n\n01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000\nThe first I know what it is.\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nThey've never made it before.\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nThat's my point.\n\n01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000\nThat's my point.\n\n01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nWhat's a porch?\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000\nYou got a piece of wood.\n\n01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nThat's my point.\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000\nWell, those will be the steps that we got to get some more wood to make the porch.\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nYou can get online right now and type I need to make a porch into Googlepedia and you will be able to draw on 5000 years of people making shit with wood, right?\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nEvery time a joist gets invented or discovered, there's like racks of shit at Home Depot and there's time life books and there's people sharing notes.\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000\nAnd when things don't work, they don't make the cut.\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nThat's right.\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000\nAnd they evaporate.\n\n01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:43.000\nSo when you have something as simple as like making a house that people live in or making a porch swing, you have this like memetic evolution where people compare notes and share what they've learned.\n\n01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:56.000\nAnd with breaking stories, which to me is agonizing and no one wants to do it, I don't want to spend eight hours a day knowing only one thing, which is that I don't know what to do next.\n\n01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000\nIt's like, what the fuck you, man?\n\n01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000\nI'm entitled to more than that.\n\n01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nI want a Sunday and a hand job right now.\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:13.000\nOkay, like when is story, like my career is like propelled by this like will to laziness.\n\n01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000\nAnd then I never, I'm like, there's got to be an easy way to do this.\n\n01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nJoseph Campbell must know, okay, Jesus Christ, this guy talks a lot.\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000\nOh, fuck.\n\n01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nGod damn it.\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nOkay.\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nMaybe if I break it down, it's like I never, like I can never figure it out.\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nI can never work smarter, not harder.\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nThat's why I'm so frustrated also by the technology involving interactive whiteboards, which I know we have, but we don't have because there's no demand for it.\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000\nWe're in the golden age of television.\n\n01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000\n144 pieces of wood.\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.000\nIs what it takes to make a porch.\n\n01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000\nNo, to run a writer's room.\n\n01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nTo make a, what do you think?\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nWhat were we talking?\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000\nYeah.\n\n01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000\nAll right.\n\n01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:10.000\nWe should be able to know like how it's like I like if I if I could go back in time through a Russian tunnel.\n\n01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nWhat?\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nAnd and simply just be able to access from 2009 onward all of the work on every single community episode Rick and Morty episode like just be able to look at just the strokes on the whiteboard in order and all that stuff to be able to like pour\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nover that with the same amount of facility that we can pour over our baby's photos are our weddings and stuff like that.\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:40.000\nLike we have the digital technology, but we don't we somehow regard this idea that writers work in writer's rooms.\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000\nWe regarded as if it's some kind of like there's like this blind spot there where we're like, well, that's none of your business.\n\n01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000\nHow we get our shit done.\n\n01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nBut it's like, wait a minute, man, we're all working towards like a common goal here.\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nIf you figured it out how you can do it in two minutes, then we could start accelerating our our television culture, right?\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000\nLike true, but all artists do that.\n\n01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nAll artists hide their process, which is interesting that you let us in.\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nThat's why I was always trying to push because yeah if you you use joists, but the truth of the matter is with carbon tree, the joinery is hidden.\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nSo like some dudes are not using metal at all.\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000\nSome dudes are using just pegs.\n\n01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nSome dudes are just using a dowel.\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:26.000\nThere's always this thing of like if you look at this stage right now, you don't see a nail because carpenters don't show you how they make stuff.\n\n01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nThat's the game.\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000\nThat's what the Masons are built on is the entire crime.\n\n01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000\nWell, the Masons that was their first impulse was like, wait, oh, are you thinking what I'm thinking?\n\n01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000\nYeah, we know how to make a doorway not fall on your head when you over the door.\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000\nWell, fucking how about we keep this from people until the next election?\n\n01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nYeah, you're right.\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nThat's there's first instinct.\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000\nTo be honest, even when you're painting, you're trying to use paints that nobody else can get their hands on.\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nI don't like that impulse.\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000\nI don't like it.\n\n01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000\nAnd I don't think it's because I'm a noble person.\n\n01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nI think it's because I'm so fucking much more narcissistic than other creatives.\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000\nI actually like in my head and I think this is changing now.\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nI'm 46, but I think I'm like, I think in my 25 year old like Max Landesey brain.\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000\nI think that.\n\n01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000\nNot this weekend.\n\n01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000\nNot this weekend.\n\n01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:18.000\nI think that like my goal has always been like, let's just eliminate all this fucking shit that has nothing to do with talent.\n\n01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nAnd then just have a fucking dick measuring contest.\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nIt's just like, who came out of the womb more special?\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000\nWhat's with all this?\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nMichigan's getting in the way.\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nYou know, like, like how hard it is to figure this and that out.\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nBut like, I don't think that way anymore because it's like, it's like, it's like digging through a cotton candy mountain, like looking for a, you know what?\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000\nBad writer.\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000\nLike, where was that going to go?\n\n01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.000\nWhat I could use is a good room full of talented collaborators that I wish I knew how to use.\n\n01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nNot here.\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000\nDid you go through a process?\n\n01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000\nWeissall or speed demon is where we've come to call you.\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nLike my big lesson on community was that I threw this like idea of, well, I don't want to be an asshole.\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nSo I'm not going to make them do anything which is abusing them.\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nLike, did you, I don't know how big your writing staff is.\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000\nWe had a pretty small writer's room we had.\n\n01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nI think like five writers and all.\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nSo did you ever do this thing where you're like, hold up and going like, I'll just write the script.\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000\nYou guys eat some M&Ms.\n\n01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nIt would, it was usually, I mean, like even on Rick and Morty, I think I felt like the first couple of hours is just kind of like dicking around, you know?\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:46.000\nAnd then you just eventually, actually, like I used to, I was listening to Harmontown and then when I got to Rick and Morty, it was just kind of like dicking.\n\n01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000\nIt was kind of like, you know.\n\n01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000\nWhat happens on the show?\n\n01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nI think there's a little bit of warm up that occurs.\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000\nSo you're just kind of having fun as a group.\n\n01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:08.000\nAnd sometimes you'll find something that sparks pleasure and you try to find what that pleasure is and how to get to it.\n\n01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000\nAnd how, like, I think in season two was a get schwifty song.\n\n01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000\nWe all thought it was funny.\n\n01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000\nLike, how do we write a story for that?\n\n01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000\nBecause that brings us a lot of pleasure.\n\n01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000\nYeah.\n\n01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000\nYeah.\n\n01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000\nYeah.\n\n01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000\nNever nailed it.\n\n01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000\nThere's no formula.\n\n01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000\nDon't know how to do it.\n\n01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000\nDo you think that's why artists and carpenters try to hide what they do?\n\n01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:46.000\nBecause if we knew, if we saw, like to me, like I always tell my parents or people who aren't in the business, if you saw what I did, if you looked at what I would do, you would go, you're doing nothing.\n\n01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000\nYou're just fucking around all day.\n\n01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nBut it's not true.\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:15:02.000\nI mean, like, when you're not writing, you're thinking about writing or you're outlining or you're writing or whatever, or you're doing a lot of, you're basically doing it wrong until you do it right and you do it wrong.\n\n01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:12.000\nI mean, the funny thing is, yeah, I know that, I know that, like, I have my older brother's voice in my head when we're taking two hours to get started because we have so much to talk about.\n\n01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:19.000\nAnd it's like, wait, when are you guys going to ever do anything for a living except sitting there fucking jerking each other off?\n\n01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nAnd then, but then I also, the same voice in my head as soon as we get started for the next four hours is like 20 minutes into it.\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000\nI know every ghost in my head that I feel all of them snap.\n\n01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:42.000\nAnd they go like, this is ridiculous. Why are you thinking about this for so long? Just have fun. It's just a good show.\n\n01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:50.000\nHe has a booger ray. Every lesson you've ever learned is about having fun. Why aren't you ruining it? Stop ruining it.\n\n01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nYou're ruining it. Stop. You're overthinking it.\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nAnd then you go like, I'm not going to overthink it anymore.\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:02.000\nI'm going to go, what if you just had a booger ray? And then you're just like, okay, he's got a booger ray. Like, oh, write the scene.\n\n01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nHe's got a booger ray and he's got a booger ray and he just read it and everyone goes.\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000\nAnd maybe sometimes you even just go all the way through therapy and you go like fucking just keep it moving.\n\n01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000\nHe's got a booger ray. Draw it. Draw it. Draw the booger ray.\n\n01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:22.000\nAnd then they like draw it and the musician goes like, booger ray theme. Here comes the booger ray.\n\n01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000\nAnd then the editor like pieces it together and everyone's got bloodshot eyes in there.\n\n01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.000\nI was like, here it is. And they press play and it's like, hey, Rick, Morty, whoever you are, I got a booger ray.\n\n01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nI'm going to pull it out. Here's the booger ray. Zap, zap, zap.\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nOh geez, Rick, you really shot good with that booger ray. Yeah, I did Morty. Didn't I?\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000\nI really did. I really shot good with that booger ray.\n\n01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:50.000\nBut I always do it 100%. 100% with that booger ray. 100% booger ray. 100years.com booger ray.\n\n01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nOh, that's great. Yeah, that's great, Morty. That's great. That's great.\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nThree minutes later and then they press pause and now you got two EPs at the top going like,\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:13.000\nseems to lack a little something. Yeah, but they don't want to call it the part where we agonize in the writer's room\n\n01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:22.000\nbecause that makes everyone mad too. Let's figure out how to fix it. I haven't figured it out.\n\n01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:30.000\nWell, I think because I'm working on a 11 minute show, we can do the book booger ray episode.\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000\nAnd it's not the 22 minute where... Man, he's stealing your idea.\n\n01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nYeah, season two, episode one is the booger ray episode. We stole it and it's coming out.\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:52.000\nWell, let's punish Justin because we got Goldenfold's voice here. I'll do Rick and Morty.\n\n01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nYou can be the voice of Celestra, the ice queen. And Waysaw, you do Rubik, the amazing cube.\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nAnd we'll improvise an episode of Rick and Morty. Okay.\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:18.000\nOkay, here we go. Oh shit, we lost our Goldenfold. Hold on. Let's get him lubricated.\n\n01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:24.000\nJust like at work.\n\n01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:30.000\nYeah, is there as much drinking going on in the writer's room?\n\n01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nNot at Hot Streets.\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nI don't drink at work.\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000\nBefore two.\n\n01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000\nSorry, before we start, was Rubik kind of like the...\n\n01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nHe was an amazing cube.\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nDid he sound like Howie Mandel from Grimlins?\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nHe kind of did, yeah, but you don't have to do that.\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000\nHe's more of an Emmanuel Lewis kind of a character.\n\n01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000\nOh, a connoisseur.\n\n01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nI mean, I was just riffing something.\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000\nOkay, fade in, interior Rick's garage day.\n\n01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nGotta put this transistor inside this compactor.\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nHey, Rick, do you think you could give me a new prom suit for the prom tonight?\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000\nMorty would rather eat glass than ever indulge in your adolescent fucking rituals.\n\n01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000\nYou piece of shit, everything you believe is a lie.\n\n01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000\nOkay, well, as mom said...\n\n01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000\nYour mom says a lot of things, Morty.\n\n01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000\nShe said, yes, when your father said, would you like this in you?\n\n01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nI think that says enough about her.\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:50.000\nIf I ever dabbled in time travel, believe me, a lot of problems would be solved.\n\n01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000\nWe wouldn't be having this conversation.\n\n01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nRick, are you extra drunk?\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nYes.\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.000\nAll I wanted was an extra prom suit.\n\n01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000\nAll right, Morty, look, fine, here.\n\n01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:10.000\nThis serum, if you pour it on yourself, it'll turn your clothes into whatever your mind thinks is important.\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nThat's the B story.\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nIt's low stakes, hopefully it'll generate a lot of bits with, I'm saying, summer.\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nShe's on the payroll, got to use her. Go talk to your sister about clothes while I deal with what I'm working on on this bench.\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000\nGoldenfold enters the open garage.\n\n01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nLet's go.\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000\nI smell poop.\n\n01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nGoldenfold, can you use your finger for a second?\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000\nI need an extra hand.\n\n01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000\nI was just extra mean to Morty and I needed some assistance.\n\n01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000\nYeah, sure, but you're not going to pull my finger, are you?\n\n01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nI have a flatulence problem.\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:03.000\nI'm way more sophisticated than that. Just put your finger here and hold down that button and no matter what you do,\n\n01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:11.000\ndon't wish that wishing was impossible.\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.000\nI was just wishing that wishing wasn't impossible.\n\n01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nWhat have you done? You created a new story.\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nWelcome to my domain.\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000\nWhat the fuck? Shit, my portal gun. I left it on the toilet again.\n\n01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000\nThere's no need for portals.\n\n01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000\nOr guns here, my domain. Please have a seat.\n\n01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000\nShit.\n\n01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000\nTwo chairs out of nowhere. How did I do that?\n\n01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000\nPlease tell me that you want to probe me.\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000\nI want to probe you. Is that how you say hello?\n\n01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000\nMeanwhile at the Smith House in the B story.\n\n01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:11.000\nHey, Summer, Rick told me to occupy you in a scene that has to do with me pouring a serum on my clothes.\n\n01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nHi, I'm Rubix.\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:22.000\nWhen you poured that serum on you, it created me.\n\n01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000\nAnd I am here to stay. And Rick and Morty.\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:35.000\nOh, geez. Rick must have given me a serum. He must have mixed them up.\n\n01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nAnd now I got a Rubik.\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.000\nIf you put me to shape correctly, Al, grant you a wish.\n\n01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000\nWell, that's no problem at all. I can do that for sure.\n\n01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000\nI watch PewDiePie do this all the time, I think.\n\n01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.000\nMy generation. I watch videos about people reacting to videos about Rubik's cubes.\n\n01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.000\nSo here we go. I did it. I made you the same color on all sides.\n\n01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000\nI grant you one wish.\n\n01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nWhoa.\n\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000\nJessica.\n\n01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.000\nBack to Narnia Planet.\n\n01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000\nThat's when I found out I was adopted.\n\n01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000\nThank you for sharing that. That was a wonderful story.\n\n01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nThat was really great. Here, have some more ice muffins.\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000\nOh, delicious.\n\n01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.000\nHey, Ice Queen, how come my body is turning into ice?\n\n01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nThat's because you're sweating too much.\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nAre you hiding something? Is he hiding something?\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:47.000\nI think you're hiding something. Why don't you have a seat before you completely freeze\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000\nand kind of just let something off of your chest, just like your friend did here.\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nJust let something off of your chest. Let it off.\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000\nWe really got to get out of here.\n\n01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:04.000\nThere's something about this Narnia mushroom that's making it easy to release my thoughts.\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nOh, my father.\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.000\nYou just said something about your father. Let's probe that.\n\n01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nMy father took me on a fishing trip.\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.000\nHe threw me out of a boat.\n\n01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000\nI didn't know how to swim.\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nI was sucked down into the muck.\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nI had a regular eyebrow.\n\n01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nAnd regular hair.\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:45.000\nAnd then a caterpillar climbed onto my forehead at the bottom of the lake.\n\n01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000\nGave me my trademark unibrow.\n\n01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nAnd then my hair became spiky as I moved up through the water,\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000\nwhich was next to an alcohol plant.\n\n01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000\nAnd so I became an alcoholic. That's why I drink.\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000\nAnd my clothes, the color was bleached out of them by the alcohol and the water.\n\n01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:15.000\nSo I came out of the lake looking like all of the qualities that my character has.\n\n01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:21.000\nThat's fascinating. We'll be right back.\n\n01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000\nBen gay foot cream makes your foot less...herty.\n\n01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000\nHey, my name's Ben. Let me cream on your foot.\n\n01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nOh, fuck.\n\n01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nReach for the solution that counts. Reach for Ben gay.\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nOh, that pony.\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.000\nThis Sunday at the Toronto Truck Show, all trucks all the time in Toronto.\n\n01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nThere's the Daisy Plus 40-foot yacht.\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nCome meet David Hasselhoff and the cast of...\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nYou at the park.\n\n01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:00.000\nDo you have doing my own taxes, Idis?\n\n01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nMy name is Tax Johnson. I'll do all your taxes.\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:10.000\nCall me. I'm Spanish. A brigado.\n\n01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nWe now return to Rick and Morty.\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000\nOh, shit. Fuck.\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nOh, Ice Queen. This is so good.\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000\nGoddamn.\n\n01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:29.000\nFuckin' me in the butt with that icicle strap on.\n\n01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nMeanwhile, in the B story...\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nOh, geez. Summer. Oh, God.\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nAll right. All right. Let's put a little wrap that up there.\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000\nWe're just trying to punish Justin for not coming.\n\n01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000\nHe thinks having too much edible is bad.\n\n01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nYeah.\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000\nIs this Canon?\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000\nYeah. I have at least 50% right to say.\n\n01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000\nThat's it. Now we know how Rick got his eyebrows.\n\n01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000\nActually, there's one thing I wanted to talk to you about.\n\n01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000\nOh, shit. Real behind the secret.\n\n01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000\nHere we go.\n\n01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.000\nDo you think, like, because I've been getting into, like, anime lately?\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nAnd, like...\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nI know. I know.\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000\nAnd then, and giggled, and giggled at the same time.\n\n01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000\nAnime.\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nBut, like, what do you think about, like,\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000\ngiving too much information about a character?\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.000\nLike, because, like, I've been...\n\n01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000\nI've been re...\n\n01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000\nTired?\n\n01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000\nI've been tired.\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000\nBut what do you think about this?\n\n01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nI think it's a terrible idea. I'm not being glib.\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:53.000\nBecause I think that our friends don't have origin stories.\n\n01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000\nWe learn things about them that make sense when we look at them as a whole.\n\n01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000\nBut we don't learn the...\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:05.000\nAs much as we enjoyed the River Phoenix opening to Indiana Jones, the third movie,\n\n01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nit also simultaneously, we were watching Indiana Jones die.\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000\nLike, we were getting too much information.\n\n01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000\nThat's how I feel about that stuff.\n\n01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000\nWhen I was watching season three, episode one,\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nwhat I was feeling is that,\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nbecause there had been so much talk about\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000\nwhat had happened to Beth's mom,\n\n01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000\nthat it had become a bigger mystery than it may be,\n\n01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000\nbecause it ended on a cliffhanger,\n\n01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nto me, like, when episode three, or season three came out, episode one,\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000\nand you're like, it's all about Szechuan sauce, which I thought was hilarious.\n\n01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nBut, like, was that to diffuse that whole, like...\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nBecause, like, people are wanting...\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nYeah, you have to undercut any efforts made in that area.\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000\nI think you provide both. You give people the option.\n\n01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000\nI think there's, like, 35 different categories of TV viewer.\n\n01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000\nThere are people who relentlessly catalog,\n\n01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000\nthere are people who hate what they love,\n\n01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nthere are people who ship, there are people who hate shippers,\n\n01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nthere are...\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:26.000\nBut all of them represent, like, some small part of what you experience\n\n01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000\nwhen you watch a TV show, and I think that the responsible thing\n\n01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nin terms of craft, person, ship, you're welcome, ladies,\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.000\nof mid-word, mid-word, inclusive, 90-degree fucking move,\n\n01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000\ndidn't even, and didn't stop the show and point it out either.\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000\nOkay, okay, don't break your arm.\n\n01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000\nHappy February.\n\n01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nDon't break your arm, Pat, yourself on the back.\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000\nFucking woke.\n\n01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000\nWoke, AF, hashtag!\n\n01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nUm...\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000\nOh, my God.\n\n01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000\nI love that your hashtag is backwards.\n\n01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000\nI put the hashtag on the end.\n\n01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nMotherfuckers gonna die, hashtag!\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000\nWait.\n\n01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000\nWait a minute.\n\n01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000\nUm, what the fuck was I babbling about?\n\n01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000\nOh, God.\n\n01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nWe're in the black house base.\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000\nWe're giving too much backstory to a character\n\n01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000\nwhy you should not.\n\n01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000\nIt's not about willful denial of it either.\n\n01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000\nI don't...\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.000\nIt's just, it's about respecting everyone's right.\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000\nRight is a strong word because I hate everyone\n\n01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nand they don't have rights to material, but...\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000\nWell, you've said this before.\n\n01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000\nAnd maybe I've read this other place,\n\n01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000\nanother book I've read about writing.\n\n01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000\nIt's like start the story as far into the story as you can.\n\n01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000\nAnd let it be Doctor Who, which Doctor Who evolved naturally,\n\n01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000\nbut they accidentally found what I think is the way\n\n01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nto survive post-Golden Age TV with a franchise,\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000\na modular franchise.\n\n01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000\nNow, look, Serial TV is great.\n\n01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000\nI love Russian doll.\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000\nI love it all.\n\n01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000\nI love the Groundhog Days of Genre now.\n\n01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000\nIt's fine.\n\n01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000\nLike, I will...\n\n01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nI'm not gonna end up being...\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000\nI'm too old.\n\n01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000\nIt's too late for me.\n\n01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000\nLike, modularity is like that feeling of,\n\n01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000\nlike, that's my family.\n\n01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000\nI can come home to them anytime I want.\n\n01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nThey're always there.\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nAunt Jackie's always a fucking drunk.\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.000\nMaybe there could be an episode where she's not a drunk.\n\n01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000\nIf that fucks up your show,\n\n01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000\nit's because you didn't design Aunt Jackie's character right.\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000\nLike, because nobody's character is that they're drunk,\n\n01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nhe said.\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nHa ha!\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nWhatever.\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nBut, like, I mean, yeah, I mean,\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nyou triggered a thing that could make me talk for three hours.\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000\nOh, I actually want to talk.\n\n01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000\nWhat do you think, because I think,\n\n01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000\nlike, one of the greatest black holes of drama right now\n\n01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nis the mystery box theory of storytelling,\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nwhere you keep teasing the audience,\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000\nand then you, at the end, it's just a bigger mystery.\n\n01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nIt's kind of like...\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000\nLost.\n\n01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000\nIt's lost.\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nYeah, but we'll see where that goes.\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000\nI think that's like painting yourself in a corner.\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nThere's a tweaked version of mystery box,\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000\nwhich is mystery buffet,\n\n01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nwhere you keep opening it up more and more.\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000\nYou keep giving people more and more options.\n\n01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000\nYou don't, you never deny anything.\n\n01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000\nThe first rule is that if it's canon, it's canon.\n\n01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000\nYou can't, you don't move back on it.\n\n01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000\nYou never say, well, you perceived that wrong.\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000\nWe didn't, you know, you just keep adding more things.\n\n01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000\nYou're hosting a party.\n\n01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.000\nYou go, like, hey, who wants to get high?\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000\nThey just invented ketamine, so I have it now.\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nYou always stay on top of everything,\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nand just, like, there's a room in every house\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000\nfor every type of person.\n\n01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000\nThere's a room in your party for people who hate parties.\n\n01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000\nThat's when you're, like, that's if you're a good host.\n\n01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000\nThere's just plants and a dog in here, man.\n\n01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000\nJust relax.\n\n01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nI hate everyone else, too.\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000\nThat's cool.\n\n01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000\nLike, and, yeah, I said, like, they said,\n\n01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:59.000\nthat's, no, no, like, this is going to pay off one day.\n\n01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000\nLike, I would hate to make that promise.\n\n01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000\nYou know, oh, hang on, everybody.\n\n01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nOoh, there's the one our man again.\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000\nIt's going to hang on.\n\n01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000\nThat's why you should enjoy the show.\n\n01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000\nYou don't, you don't want to cross that threshold of,\n\n01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.000\nlike, this is why it seems like it's a little disingenuous.\n\n01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000\nIt's its own trick, which is to trick people.\n\n01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000\nI think when people sit down and they want to hear a story,\n\n01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000\nthey want to hear a story, and they want you to go from A to B.\n\n01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000\nIf you go boo-hoo butt.\n\n01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000\nI feel like that's, like, the equivalent of throwing sand in a fight.\n\n01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000\nYeah.\n\n01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000\nLike, I feel like when, when, when broadcast television\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000\nstarted competing with cable television,\n\n01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000\nthat's when serialization and cliffhangers started happening.\n\n01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nThat's when event television started happening,\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000\nand there's good, good stories that emerge from it,\n\n01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000\nand there, but overall, it's like,\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000\nLike what?\n\n01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nHow can I compete with American Idol if I'm just Knight Rider?\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000\nWell, the answer is Knight Rider has to go,\n\n01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:59.000\nI just committed incest with, to be continued.\n\n01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nIt's like, like, you have to tune in.\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000\nYou have to, you have to.\n\n01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000\nWe're not even going to finish making television until you tune in,\n\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000\nwhich I think is, like, not...\n\n01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000\nBut I think, I think, like, like Breaking Bad did it, like, really well.\n\n01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:16.000\nLike, that's, like, that, to me, was, like, binge TV before Netflix made it.\n\n01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000\nYeah.\n\n01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000\nI hated the ending.\n\n01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000\nWell, you...\n\n01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nWell, I mean...\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nI would, I would say, like, shows...\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000\nYeah, I guess...\n\n01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000\nI like shows that in the finale of that season,\n\n01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000\nthey kind of tie up the mysteries.\n\n01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000\nLike, the wire, like, when you get to the end,\n\n01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000\nit's like, that's the season.\n\n01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000\nRight.\n\n01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000\nLike, you, you feel nourished.\n\n01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000\nLike, that's the story, and it goes down and feels good.\n\n01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000\nI like that, like, both Law and Order and X-Files\n\n01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000\nwhere they intersect is that both shows\n\n01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.000\ndelineated between mythology energy and modular energy.\n\n01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000\nSo Law and Order was the extreme of it,\n\n01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000\nbecause it's like, they don't want to lose a single viewer\n\n01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000\nto the idea that you have to know who these people are.\n\n01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000\nSo they just let you get addicted to Jerry Oribach.\n\n01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000\nLike, of course you should.\n\n01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000\nHe's a...\n\n01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000\nWhat is a character?\n\n01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000\nHe's a raincoat.\n\n01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000\nHe's an eyebrow.\n\n01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000\nHe...\n\n01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000\nGive the actor some credit, you know?\n\n01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nYeah.\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000\nLike, that's what they're gonna fall in love with.\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nSo just let him, like, rate your stories.\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000\nYou're a writer.\n\n01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000\nLike, give these people something to do\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000\nso that if you watch one episode,\n\n01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000\nit's like smoking a crack rock,\n\n01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000\nwhich is, yes, connected to all other crack rocks,\n\n01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000\nbut not necessary to smoke that crack rock\n\n01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000\nbefore that crack rock.\n\n01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nThat's the difference.\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nIt's like, crack is the goal.\n\n01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000\nSo...\n\n01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000\nAnd I love, like, I always want, like,\n\n01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.000\nI watch Law and Order and Syndication on TBS,\n\n01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.000\nand I was like...\n\n01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000\nI was like, I got so fucking hooked after, like, five of them,\n\n01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000\nand I'm just like, God damn, I love Jerry Oribach.\n\n01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000\nGod damn, I love this and that.\n\n01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000\nAnd, like, never anything, no plot, nothing,\n\n01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nexcept for the one self-contained plot\n\n01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000\nof the homicide that happened and the solving of it.\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000\nAnd then at the end of the season,\n\n01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nthe lieutenant, like, Jerry Oribach's, like,\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nwell, I guess that crowbar murderer found out\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nnot to pry, and I made it up.\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000\nWhat, you made that up?\n\n01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000\nAnd it's like...\n\n01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000\nAnd then the lieutenant, like, stops him\n\n01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nas he's about to leave the doorway,\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nand he goes, like, hey, and he turns around,\n\n01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000\nand she goes, how's the drinking going?\n\n01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.000\nAnd he goes, yeah, one day at a time.\n\n01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000\nAnd then he walks out, Dick Wolf.\n\n01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000\nThat was an entire season.\n\n01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000\nThat was all you learned about Jerry Oribach,\n\n01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000\nunless you, like, but then it, like, makes you go,\n\n01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000\nyou gobble it up, sorry, I'm babbling, whatever.\n\n01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000\nNo, no, no, it's a good point.\n\n01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000\nBut X-Files did this, a similar thing\n\n01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000\nwith the Smoking Man stuff, where it was, like,\n\n01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000\nif they had been able to hold that line,\n\n01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000\nwhich I'm not, like, just that idea of, like,\n\n01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000\nyou know, every time, it's like, all we wanted was,\n\n01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000\ngive me more about Smoking Man and what happened\n\n01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000\nto Fox's sister and all this stuff,\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000\nand it was like, how could they ever resist,\n\n01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nlike, giving us more and more of that,\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nbut every time they gave you more of that,\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000\nyou're, like, you're losing something.\n\n01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000\nIt's, like, ballast or something,\n\n01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000\nand it's, like, you want to, like, keep that shit up there.\n\n01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000\nIs that how you play event-centered\n\n01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000\nversus character-driven against each other\n\n01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000\nin the course of a season?\n\n01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000\nI think I could just say yes to that question,\n\n01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000\nbut I don't, I'm not sure I understand that.\n\n01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000\nWell, it's like Twin Peaks, the minute,\n\n01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000\nthe minute they said, okay, this is what happened\n\n01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000\nwith Laura Palmer, the show was over with,\n\n01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000\nbut they went on another season.\n\n01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000\nLike, you want to keep, you want to keep,\n\n01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000\nthe stuff that's, it's not the destination,\n\n01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000\nit's the journey, you know, with any of these shows.\n\n01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000\nI mean, Nick, I can't keep for the life of me.\n\n01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000\nYou want to entertain that fantasy\n\n01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000\nthat you can do something else,\n\n01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000\nbut that's why I was obsessive.\n\n01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000\nThat was my big rift with Sony.\n\n01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nFor the three years it took to fire me on Community,\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000\nwas that I was like, yes, this is a great show.\n\n01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000\nYes, my goal is to make it fucking amazing\n\n01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000\nin a way that would make you want to watch\n\n01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000\na thousand episodes of it.\n\n01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000\nBut in order to do that, we have to acknowledge\n\n01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000\nthat we made a deal with a certain chronological devil.\n\n01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000\nWe said that Annie Edison is a child\n\n01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000\nand that she's growing up.\n\n01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000\nWe said that Jeff Winger is paying\n\n01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000\na four years price for who he was.\n\n01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000\nWe're telling a story here.\n\n01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000\nLike, we have to get out in front of this thing\n\n01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000\nso far, so fast that no one notices\n\n01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000\nthat we stopped having to go to Community College\n\n01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000\nbecause at some point we're going to have to.\n\n01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000\nAnd like, Sony would get so mad.\n\n01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nThey'd be like, what are you talking about?\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000\nWatch fucking Welcome Back Cotter\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000\nand shut the fuck up.\n\n01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000\nWatch MASH, you dumb asshole.\n\n01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.000\nThe show was 11 years longer than the war\n\n01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000\nand everyone's rich.\n\n01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000\nWhy are you burning our money?\n\n01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000\nStop making television for Reddit.\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000\nAnd I was like, it's not going to work, man.\n\n01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000\nWe're not going to be able to say it's Halloween\n\n01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000\nfor the 90th time in a row.\n\n01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000\nAnd Allison Breeze was like, oh,\n\n01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000\nit was a forbidden fruit again.\n\n01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000\nIt's a four year story, but yeah.\n\n01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000\nAnyway, I'm sorry, let's get out of here.\n\n01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.000\nYou triggered fucking your Vietnam vet dad.\n\n01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000\nI pretended to be dead.\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000\nThey wanted a tripod on me.\n\n01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000\nAll this because somebody dropped a plate.\n\n01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000\nCalm down, dad.\n\n01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000\nWeissal.\n\n01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000\nHot streets.\n\n01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000\nEvery mystery that is introduced\n\n01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.000\nwill get revealed by the end of the season.\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000\nYou will not be tricked.\n\n01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000\nThe history of television, someone will know that\n\n01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000\nNBC peaked at this point where it was like,\n\n01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000\nthey had literally had a show called The Event.\n\n01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000\nIt was like right before 80% of you were like\n\n01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000\neven invested in anything because it was like\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000\nyou were born on Netflix and so you're kind of like,\n\n01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000\nbut there was this point where it was like\n\n01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000\nthe squeezing of the sponge before everyone was like,\n\n01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000\nfuck it, who's on Shark Tank?\n\n01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000\nThey were like greenlighting these crazy series\n\n01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000\nbecause it was like the idea of event television.\n\n01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000\nAnd NBC, God bless their sincere, dopey heart.\n\n01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000\nIt was just like, well, then literally,\n\n01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000\nlet's just make a show called The Event.\n\n01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000\nAnd there's like, if you go to the commercial\n\n01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000\nbecause they had this like whole teaser campaign with it,\n\n01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.000\nthe teaser campaign was them explaining to you\n\n01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000\nwhat the show wasn't because it was about payoffs\n\n01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.000\nand they would go, the president getting assassinated\n\n01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:42.000\nis not the event.\n\n01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000\nAnd then it shows a guy going,\n\n01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000\nwhy am I leaving the White House?\n\n01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000\nI'll tell you on the way.\n\n01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:54.000\nThe concert exploding is not the event.\n\n01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000\nYou were supposed to tune into the show\n\n01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000\nto find out what the event was.\n\n01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000\nTelevision reduced to breakfast cereal.\n\n01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000\nWhat was the event?\n\n01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.000\nThe event was its fucking cancellation after six episodes.\n\n01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000\nThe event was a lot of guys that work a lot less\n\n01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000\nharder than I do, getting a lot more money.\n\n01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000\nI don't want to be bitter.\n\n01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.000\nThey smacked this kid at a backyard barbecue.\n\n01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000\nThe slap!\n\n01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000\nYeah, and it's told.\n\n01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000\nThe slap is the event.\n\n01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000\nIt's told from everybody's point of view.\n\n01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:34.000\nYou will find out whether or not Betty is ugly.\n\n01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000\nYeah.\n\n01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000\nWhat am I doing?\n\n01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000\nLike, my job is to know what to say next.\n\n01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000\nEveryone knows I don't.\n\n01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000\nFebruary 24th at midnight.\n\n01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000\nHot street season two.\n\n01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000\nWho are you having on this season?\n\n01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000\nAny major super celebrities?\n\n01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000\nThis is Hollywood.\n\n01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.000\nWe've got Ernie Hudson during the cast.\n\n01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000\nI like the black one.\n\n01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.000\nYou know, when you watch season one, it's always sunny.\n\n01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000\nI remember watching a thing.\n\n01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000\nThis show is really funny.\n\n01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000\nAnd then Danny DeVito jends the cast.\n\n01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000\nAnd they're like, holy shit, the show,\n\n01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000\nit's weird to watch the first season.\n\n01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000\nThat's how I feel with Ernie Hudson.\n\n01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000\nWhy, so I heard this story.\n\n01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000\nMaybe you can confirm this and share an animation buff\n\n01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000\nand your friends with Ernest Hudson.\n\n01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:24.000\nI heard during that when they did the real Ghostbusters\n\n01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.000\nanimated series that Ernie Hudson auditioned for Winston\n\n01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000\nbut lost it to Arsenial Hall.\n\n01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000\nIs this true?\n\n01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000\nThat is true, but I mean, I'm speaking for him,\n\n01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000\nbut I've read interviews with him where he auditioned for the part.\n\n01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000\nBut when we cast him, his voice is so powerful\n\n01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000\nthat I think what happened was like,\n\n01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000\nyou had all these voice actors that were really\n\n01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000\nfounding and talented.\n\n01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000\nBut Winston would be the lead character\n\n01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000\nbecause his voice is so fucking powerful\n\n01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000\nthat you can't ignore it.\n\n01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:03.000\nSo I feel like in the movies, Winston was kind of...\n\n01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000\nSomething weird happened.\n\n01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.000\nYeah, it's kind of weird.\n\n01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000\nLike, he's not really in the movie.\n\n01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000\nIt was like he was over-empowered maybe by virtue\n\n01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000\nof a latent racism.\n\n01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000\nI'm not trying to high-road anybody.\n\n01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000\nIt was the 80s.\n\n01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000\nBut I remember being a 10-year-old kid,\n\n01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000\na 12-year-old kid watching Ghostbusters.\n\n01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000\nHe had a flannel shirt on.\n\n01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000\nHe smoked cigarettes.\n\n01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000\nAnd his first line is like,\n\n01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000\nlook, as long as there's a steady paycheck involved,\n\n01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000\nI'll believe anything you say.\n\n01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000\nAnd he was very...\n\n01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.000\nDid that skirt the line?\n\n01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000\nDid we get shut down?\n\n01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000\nThe month of February has shut you down.\n\n01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:41.000\nBut he had that kind of like,\n\n01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000\nalbeit maybe equally problematic,\n\n01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000\nbut from a completely different direction,\n\n01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000\nwhere he was the empowered...\n\n01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000\nHe was powerful.\n\n01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000\nAnd then Ghostbusters 2,\n\n01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.000\nin addition to all the other weird things about it.\n\n01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000\nAlso, because I just...\n\n01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000\nHe just did an interview recently\n\n01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000\nwhere he was talking about Ghostbusters 2.\n\n01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000\nI didn't realize this.\n\n01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000\nBut in Ghostbusters 2,\n\n01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000\nthey do this thing where they catch up\n\n01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000\nwith all the characters,\n\n01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000\nbut they don't catch up with Winston.\n\n01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000\nHe just comes back in the middle of the movie.\n\n01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000\nEverybody has their own business.\n\n01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000\nAnd then Winston just comes back.\n\n01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.000\nThat's documentary-worthy.\n\n01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:22.000\nAnybody watch that Lorena Bobbitt documentary?\n\n01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000\nNo, I do remember it, though.\n\n01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000\nStick with it.\n\n01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000\nI started to get a stick of it.\n\n01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000\nThat's the name of the documentary?\n\n01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000\nStick with it.\n\n01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000\nStick with it.\n\n01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000\nStick it back on.\n\n01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000\nI swear, like, like, if you're,\n\n01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000\nyou get to a point where you're, like,\n\n01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000\nthis is the 90th time they've explained to us\n\n01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000\nthat these people have backstories\n\n01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.000\nthat I don't care.\n\n01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000\nBut toward the end of that thing,\n\n01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000\nit gets so deep and intense.\n\n01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000\nIt's really weird.\n\n01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000\nFor me, especially...\n\n01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000\nYour dick was cut off.\n\n01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000\nI just want to remember\n\n01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000\nworking in a blue-collar city\n\n01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.000\nand doing improv,\n\n01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000\nlike, we're familiar with the Bobbits\n\n01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.960\nis a word that everyone would shout out as a suggestion\n\n01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:06.760\nfor comedy shows that we wished that they would,\n\n01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:10.960\nnot because we were feminists, because we're snobs,\n\n01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:12.360\nwe're like, shut the fuck up,\n\n01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:14.400\nwe're not doing another goddamn sketch\n\n01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:16.320\nwhere I mime a dick getting cut off.\n\n01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:18.320\nFuck you, fuck you, fuck you.\n\n01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:22.320\nSo that's all I ever knew about the bobbitt thing.\n\n01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:26.680\nAnd it's very interesting, like there's a documentary series\n\n01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:31.680\nlike they unpack it for like 10 hours of, it's worth it.\n\n01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:34.360\nBut by the end of it, I'm telling you,\n\n01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:37.880\nyou'll have like synapses that are like reformed.\n\n01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:38.840\nWhat is the takeaway?\n\n01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:40.320\nWhat's the craziest thing that you learned\n\n01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:41.720\nthat you didn't know back then?\n\n01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:47.560\nHow, our facility to ignore abuse, I mean,\n\n01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:51.240\nI really don't, it both, like as a culture,\n\n01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:54.360\nlike the way that we can like focus on the things\n\n01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:56.840\nthat are like, fuck it,\n\n01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:58.640\nnow the women are shutting us down.\n\n01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:02.120\nThe patriarchy I think is now,\n\n01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:05.920\nit's just like, oh, she cut his dick off,\n\n01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:06.960\nso that's interesting.\n\n01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:10.000\nYou got our attention, you cut a dick off,\n\n01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000\nso you have our attention.\n\n01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.120\nExcuse me, what, she cut her dick off, okay, uh, uh, hand.\n\n01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:15.840\nAnd then it's like, and then it's like this sort of,\n\n01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:20.680\nlike this like, you really come away with a complete feeling\n\n01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:22.080\nof like, look.\n\n01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:26.240\nThere's a lot more to it than just the dick getting cut off.\n\n01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:29.200\nThe unfortunate people who was long since before that\n\n01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:32.680\nwere like, does anyone want to talk about equal rights\n\n01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:36.240\nand the spousal abuse problem and all this things?\n\n01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:39.120\nAnd then this weird portal happens where it's like,\n\n01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:40.560\na woman cut a guy's dick off,\n\n01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:44.480\neveryone wants to talk about penises and abuse\n\n01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:46.560\nand battery and rape.\n\n01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:51.440\nAnd then these well-minded people who are like, okay, great.\n\n01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:54.080\nSo now let's talk about this and like the kind of tragedy\n\n01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:57.760\nof like, well, no, I mean, we want to talk about dicks\n\n01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:00.760\nand cutting off and like, we want to,\n\n01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:03.400\nwe like tablet celebrities, we don't,\n\n01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:05.000\nbut it's not a downer.\n\n01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.080\nI think it's a-\n\n01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:07.360\nIt is the beginning though, right?\n\n01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:09.200\nOf sort of like that celebrity.\n\n01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:12.200\nWell, it's time, it starts, it starts a conversation,\n\n01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:13.800\nyou know, it's like, before that,\n\n01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.760\nyou literally couldn't say the word penis in media.\n\n01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:18.720\nYou couldn't say the word penis in New York times,\n\n01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:19.560\nlike things like that.\n\n01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:23.760\nLike, so it starts a thing, it's worth watching.\n\n01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:26.080\nAnyways, I don't know how to end the show,\n\n01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:29.120\nso I thought I'd like recommend a Netflix thing.\n\n01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:31.040\nWaisal, what do you recommend?\n\n01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:33.080\nBetter be fucking not
