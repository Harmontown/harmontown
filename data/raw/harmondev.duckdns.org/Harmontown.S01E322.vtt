00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Music

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Ladies and gentlemen, how are you tonight?

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
I know you can make so much more noise than that, how are you tonight?

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Yeah, Harbin Town is now in session!

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Just in, this is now with us tonight, I'm sitting in for a minute, but it's not.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
Let's get right the fuck to it and bring out the mayor of Harbin Town, Mr. Dan Harbin!

00:29.000 --> 00:41.000
Music

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Rob Schrupp!

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Music

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Mr. Rob Schrupp!

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
Music

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Thanks everybody for coming on a Monday night.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Boy, we've got a lot of show for you.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
We've got no Spencer, we've got no Jeff, but we've got, I mean, come on, we've got the dream team.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Four empty seats.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
Yeah, we've got a provocative guest, we've got topics.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm just going off of what Schrupp's been telling me over drinks before the show.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
I'm filling them in people, filling them in for you.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Here's the bullet points, there's a mega storm coming to California that's going to kill us all.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Bigger than a big earthquake.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
I thought we just went through that shit.

01:37.000 --> 01:48.000
There's a man named Ingersoll Lockwood who in 1896 wrote a book about how the Trump family is time traveling.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
All true.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Through Tesla energies that exploded in the center of the earth.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
1900 or the last president, the magical journeys.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
There's a YouTube video and yeah, I mean, we've got to talk about that, but we'll wait for our guest to come out.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
We're just giving you a table of contents right now.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
What else is going on?

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Look, I asked Spencer for permission.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
I've been in a terrible mood lately.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I've been very depressed.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
I say that assuming that that resonates with a lot of people.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
I don't know if it's the weather or if it's like the apocalypse.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
In my case, it's just like my therapist has been warning me.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
You're arriving at happiness.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
It's not going to feel like what you're used to calling happiness.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
It's going to feel like the misplacement of something valuable, which is your fucking sadness you're addicted to.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Don't succumb to the urge to find it.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Let it be missing.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
It's your sadness.

02:54.000 --> 03:03.000
What you're experiencing is going to be this like banal limbo that's going to be like starting this happiness diet.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Like you know, you're miserable.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
I cried through my smile.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Do you get depressed? You're always in such a good mood.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
As a black man in America, no!

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Why would you?

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
Oh, just think about cotton.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Happy February, by the way.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Thank you so much.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Congratulations.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
You know, we're so happy with all the new developments.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
We like to say we're creating black history right now.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
I'm sure you don't watch my Instagram workout, but I'm like fucking like really bringing the black history thunder.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah, you're like Sojourner Truth.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Motherfucker don't know who that is.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Is that black?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Is it historical?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Although I'll learn about it then tomorrow.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
You can't keep anything from me.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah, I'm like, we're like a little past halfway through, but I work out every other day.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
So I'm like, I know like five of the amendments now.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.000
I know that our entire hit, I know that, you know, this is going to sound corny and like white nighty or whatever you call it,

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
virtue signally, but like the profound thing I'm learning as a middle-aged man, like taking black history seriously,

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
I'm reading an hour a morning going like, okay, what the fuck is Plessy versus Ferguson?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Here we go.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Okay.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
And I don't mean to make that fright sound like the truth.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
I mean, Plessy versus Ferguson deserves that fright sound, but black history, of course, does not.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
If anything, it deserves a choir of angels.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
The black history is US history and vice versa.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
I mean, the country is like, it's so, I mean, I know that we know that intellectually,

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
but I'm just sort of like, God damn, this is, everything comes out of this.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
This is like this weird experiment that we've done where we were the, we were kind of the, we were the worst.

05:05.000 --> 05:13.000
I grew up being taught that we were like, that the US was just like playing ball with this global thing called slavery

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
and that the US was like, okay, I guess we'll do it too.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
We were, we were, no, we were like really into it.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
And I really honestly did not know that.

05:23.000 --> 05:31.000
And I thought, and that like, and that then this young country like spent most of its life engaged in that concept.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
This like, this God of capitalism that we worship, where we're like, there's no kings here.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
You can't be born special.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
You could, as long as you work hard, you could take over the country.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Anyways, get back to work for free.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
Hear ye, hear ye, those guys should be able to vote and not be owned.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
You're like, yeah, I agree.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Uh-oh, what are we gonna do?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
It's true.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
It's amazing how much shit we got done despite all the people trying to stop us.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
We really were like sort of like, damn, we got to build this shit anyway.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Because we also needed a place to live.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
I could two different hats.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
I put on my 1800s racist hat.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
It's not that hard for me.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
This should be really heavy.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
I'm like, it's made of wood and like Danish bones.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Straw.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
You're not very good at it.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
It's the 1800s.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
You're not very good at hat making, but you've got a hat.

06:27.000 --> 06:35.000
I'm like, well, these people in the past, they didn't know the future that they could

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
either service or undercut every step of the way.

06:38.000 --> 06:45.000
I'm a little comfortable supposing that there's probably, there's like these, we got genuine

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
eugenics style racists in the world.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
Like people who are genuinely like, for real, let me measure your skull like fucking like

06:52.000 --> 06:58.000
count, like no really, like they're into like the whole like biological aspect of it.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Those people are arts.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
What we have in a much larger group is like a lot of like conservative people maybe who

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
are like, don't tell me I owe anybody anything.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
And I just got here.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
I don't have to feel guilty about anything.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
I don't want to share my money.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I don't have that kind of shit.

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
Not so much like, I think a vast majority of us would agree actually that given what we're

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
dealing with today, we can all look back with hindsight 100 short years ago and go, oops,

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
that was dumb because what that did is it fucked up for everything for everybody right

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
now.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Do you know what I mean?

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
Do you agree or disagree with that dumb white explanation?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
It's interesting.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Okay.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
All right.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
That's so that's as much as I'm going to get out.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
There's a lot there.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
I'm just saying like, like the great migration.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
Like where it's like, okay, the Civil War is over and the Emancipation has happened

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
and it's like people are just like doing what you'd expect them to do, which is just like

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
start to fill the rest of the country, get the fuck out of here.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Half of them can't get out of here and then half of them are like, where do I go?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
What do I do?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
What do I dress like?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
What should my name be?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
What is my fucking role in this country?

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
They hid in the woods for decades.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
They hid in the woods and then they started to form towns.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
So it got as far as Oklahoma.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
And then some people got here and there.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
The smartest thing you could do was go north, which is why you have cities like Detroit.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
But they didn't get that far west.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
But for the most part, they would have to clump together in groups and hide in the woods.

08:34.000 --> 08:42.000
So that like first three, four years after slavery ends, people are just out in the woods,

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
which is crazy.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
And it seems like cartoonishly simple.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
It's tragic.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
They're cartoons that are tragic.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
But they're just living in the woods.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
It literally, here's the thing.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
This piece of history is they didn't know what to do.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
So they just let people go.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
That's what I'm saying.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
So when we look back at that period and we go like, so running like the white kind of

09:09.000 --> 09:16.000
like panic simulator in my head when I go back in time and I don't have the privilege of being like

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I'm like living in the future.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
And I'm like, oh, well, of course everybody should blah, blah, blah.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
Like who knows what I would have called self care back then as far as not getting into trouble.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Some beers greased in a little bit of methylate.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
But like, no, everybody was like having arguments about like, well, you're free.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
You should go away now or you're free.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Everyone should give you a bunch of money now or you're free.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
I hate you.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I got to figure out how to make you hate yourself.

09:46.000 --> 09:53.000
Like nobody was thinking about everybody was like wondering what was going to happen tomorrow.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
And 80% of it was like trying to avoid something that they didn't even know what they were trying to avoid.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
They just were scared.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
No, all those three thoughts that you just had were actual thoughts that those people had.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
So self-hate, making black people hate themselves for sure.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Go, go away.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
It was certainly part of plan.

10:14.000 --> 10:20.000
I mean, there were abolitionists who were like, yeah, I hate slavery.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
We got to get these people out of here.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
That blew my mind.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
It was like the people that were...

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
It's crazy.

10:27.000 --> 10:35.000
It wasn't like people were looking at this room today and going like, so what can we do to make their life...

10:35.000 --> 10:43.000
How can we lead to that in a right way so that everyone there doesn't have a bunch of disproportionate disenfranchisement

10:43.000 --> 10:52.000
and everything's kind of confusing and in turmoil with a lot of weird debates and scary, awkward podcast conversations.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
No, no.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
It's not scary.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
They weren't thinking about us.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
They were thinking about...

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
They were definitely thinking about maintaining power for at least a thousand years.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
There is a thousand-year plan.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
That's what those things are, like the Marshall Plan and all these manifest destinies is like,

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
when a bunch of guys get together and say, what are we going to do for the next four or five hundred years?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
People are thinking like dynasty for real.

11:15.000 --> 11:22.000
It's crazy because we don't think like that, but there are legit dudes that are like, yeah.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
I don't even know what I think.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
I want to know what they could because when I think about the future, I picture a bunch of people on a space station

11:27.000 --> 11:34.000
like harvesting soy out of a hydroponic garden and everyone looks vaguely like Tiger Woods, probably.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
Because we're never going to stop being racist.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
You're never going to eliminate racism.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
You're going to eliminate race.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Always say that.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
That's the first thing that's going to happen.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
You always say that.

11:44.000 --> 11:51.000
You always say you're never going to eliminate racism, but remember that the thing that racism is attacking is stronger than racism.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
So I don't know how that's possible.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
It's almost like you really cannot beat women.

11:57.000 --> 12:04.000
You think you can, but the the the initial like attempt at starting that war has you fucked already.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Like that's just a bad idea to begin with.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
And if you look at where we're at right now, they didn't we didn't really respond the way we were supposed to respond

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
necessarily voting wise and we have more women in Congress.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
Women still figured out a way to get past us.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
You know what I'm saying?

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
The same thing goes for the same thing goes for race is that you you will wear yourself out trying to oppress.

12:28.000 --> 12:35.000
Yeah, that's a big theme of black history that I'm getting into is like noticing that basically like you have lots of people that I like.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
Narcissistically, I go like, oh, this person is more of a Dan Harmon because they just want to be left alone.

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
They're actually born kind of privileged relative to other people that that may have that complexion.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
And actually the war came to them because they couldn't.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
There was these policies like this morning's lesson was about Mamie Mamie Phipps Clark.

12:55.000 --> 13:02.000
You know, the who did the the doll test that was like a part of the Brown versus education.

13:02.000 --> 13:10.000
The doll test is taking the dolls and you you got you got dolls that have blonde hair and white faces and dolls that are brown skin and black

13:10.000 --> 13:20.000
and white and you say to kids that are like rock and rock and roll gather a bunch of kids that are two to five years old from segregated schools and from desegregated schools.

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
And you sit them down and white kids and black kids and girls and boys and you all these control groups and whatever.

13:26.000 --> 13:34.000
And you say to the kids, which one is which one's the bad kid, which one's the kid you wish you were, which etc.

13:34.000 --> 13:43.000
You know, these kind of questions and like realizing that racial identity is bored into you by the age of four and then it's just fucking soldered in place.

13:43.000 --> 13:54.000
Like which isn't necessarily a bad thing except when you when race is connected to class and and and worth and stuff like it's okay for a kid to know.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I guess that there's such a thing is raised by the age of four.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
It's really not that mature a concept.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
It's kind of dopey.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
You could you could teach your kid to celebrate it to right, which is the deal with Black History Month.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
We don't focus on the trauma necessarily.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
We focus on all the fun shit like stop likes.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
You know great shit like peanut butter peanut butter.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
No, there was that's a big misconception.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Okay, tell me what what like is George Washington Carver.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
He just wanted to be left alone of all the things he did not know.

14:26.000 --> 14:35.000
He did eleven hundred things with with peanuts, but the peanut butter, but he know that fucking passive aggression.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
Who who did it was according to Eddie Murphy.

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
It was a guy named Thomas Jeff right right, but that's the spin is you.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
Maybe look at Black History Month as a time to celebrate all of your great black heroes.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
No, I not the trauma that they went through.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
I know, believe me, there were a lot of times when I was like halfway through my workout month.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
I'm like, I don't I don't I don't want this to be a history of racism.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
But then I was like, it is and I'm that's better for me.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
Like I am following the trauma actually in point of fact like I don't follow.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
And I was like, I'm going to be obscure.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
I'm not going to look.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
I'm not going to forget Rosa Parks because it's like that's curated and all this stuff.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
But it's like, I don't know shit about, you know, the details of Rosa Parks and stuff.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
So I'm actually just going in order from Nat Turner revolt to by the end of the month.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
I think I'm going to be I'm going to fucking bring this thing into the station with like, you know, I don't know.

15:32.000 --> 15:39.000
But Bobby seal or there's also there's also Gerald Lewin though W.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
It's double L E W Y N.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
I'm not sure from saying his name right, but he's like he ran time for the longest time.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
He's like huge black rain time.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
That's not the magazine.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
The whole oh, oh, oh.

15:53.000 --> 15:59.000
I was like somebody tell him like black man ran time.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
White man stole it from him.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
Don't let them pacify you with shit like that man.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
Time isn't run by a black man.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Is that that guy in the hud sucker proxy?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Black janitor in the hud sucker.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
He was basically God.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
He kind of like is like the janitor in the clock.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
The clock building.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Oh, it's a hud sucker proxy.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
So do you have any?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Do you have any heroes?

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Was there anybody that you learned about that you were like and then we got to go?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Do you have anybody that you like?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
We're like, I didn't know this dude.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
This is incredible.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Like GPS is a black woman.

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
Well, style wise, I like Langston Hughes, but he's got to be a person who I learned the least amount about because he's a

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
poet and I didn't like read any of his poetry.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
But I like that.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
I like that there's debate about his sexuality and like that it's like it's none of your business.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
You know, and then he like he dressed fancy and he was just like he was positive.

16:58.000 --> 17:05.000
His quotes were like, like, hey, if the white man is happy with the colored man.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Sorry for my own fashionable language.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
That's great.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
If he's not, can't do nothing about that.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
Like, you know, if the black man is happy with the black man, terrific bonus gravy.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
If he's not, hey, you know, it's like this kind of like that.

17:24.000 --> 17:35.000
It was I like, I like that guy because it was like he like that's what I need in my like life right now is like overcoming approval addiction.

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
And like the Harlem Renaissance was like like about like I think I'm in my own Harlem Renaissance right now.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Brandon is what I'm saying.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Okay.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
I will fuck with this.

17:48.000 --> 17:55.000
I've got I've been emancipated from a certain tax bracket and I've like done a great migration up to the urban centers of.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
So all you need now is a gold chain.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
I'm going to invent new ways to walk.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
I'm going to write poems about nothing but rivers.

18:08.000 --> 18:18.000
I'm going to give a shit if anyone gets it and people can just speculate about where I put my dick.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
I like that people are like, oh, he's clearly gay, which is pretty important to the gay people.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
If he was gay and he was in the closet, then it's important that he was in the closet.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Why was he in the closet, etc.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
That's important to current things.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
So, you know, you don't detract from that, but it's also just kind of funny.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Well, you say because he really, really, really respected black men.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
So he was there.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
There's like, come on, look at this.

18:40.000 --> 18:47.000
Look at this thing he wrote about the regalness of the black man or whatever.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Like, wow, that's some gay stuff.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
Like kind of like that's that's fucked up.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
You know, you're right there.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
It's like interesting.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Like, yeah.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
So, so, yeah, I think I guess that's my hero right now.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
All right.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Langston Hughes.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
But I really should read something he wrote.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
You'd love it.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
You'd love it.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Yeah.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
And dust off a little James Baldwin as well, because you would love James Baldwin.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
James Baldwin.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Two L's.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
One L, one T, but Baldwin.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
You would love James Baldwin.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
All right.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
Well, let's, I mean, like as if by magic.

19:27.000 --> 19:33.000
Rob, what do you have to say about black history?

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
I like Candy Man.

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
Now there's a great documentary called on shutter called Horror Noir that goes through

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
like the history of black cinema in the horror genre.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
That's actually really, really good.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Keith David's in it.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
He's fantastic.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Tony Todd, Candy Man is in it.

19:55.000 --> 20:02.000
What is the, what is the, what's the, the, what do we glean about the connection between

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
blackness and horror?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Like, what's the special relationship?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Well.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Yeah.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Well.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
See you.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
See you.

20:11.000 --> 20:17.000
Well, when they start off with like the, like these.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
The horrible shit.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
Well, when they start off with like Birth of a Nation is like a horror film for black

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
people.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
It's just like, this is terrifying because it was incredibly popular and it just, it

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
was shown for that.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
It's kind of started all these horrible stereotypes that we still see to this day.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
Well, the idea of being, what is the deal with the idea of being scared of ghosts and

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
stuff?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Like what's that?

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Who isn't afraid of ghosts?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Yeah.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Exactly.

20:46.000 --> 20:53.000
I guess, I guess white people think it's hilarious that black people are also afraid of ghosts.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Do you think it's like Doth protest too much?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Like we're scared of black power.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
And so we're like, make them scared, make them more scared of ghosts.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
I do think there's this thing about scaring the thing that scares you.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
Well, that they touch on that in this documentary is like, they go through like, well, first

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
it was like Birth of a Nation where it was vilified.

21:12.000 --> 21:19.000
And then, then the black, the black actor in like, I don't know, like Bella the ghost

21:19.000 --> 21:25.000
he meets a Brooklyn gorilla or whatever, and then like there's the terrible stereotype

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
that he's a fool and idiot to somebody that you laugh at.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
And then as we go through into the 80s, when we get to like From Beyond and Ken Forree

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
going, I used to play pro football.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
And we were all crazy.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
We were all crazy.

21:37.000 --> 21:43.000
Back then, you know, like he set up to be like this unstoppable X linebacker cop that

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
when the monster takes that guy down, now we know it's for real.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Right.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
And they go through that like that.

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
It's always to serve the white protagonist to be the magic.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Now hold on a second doc.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Yeah.

21:58.000 --> 22:04.000
Are you telling me these wombats from outer space are some kind of vampire wombat?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Yeah.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Real good.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
But they even they even skirted skirted a problematic line there.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
But I think I nailed it.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
But there was like when there is like a big shift.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
I think we're all afraid of vampire wombats.

22:16.000 --> 22:22.000
But that role of the black, the black, the black, the black man stepping out from the

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
corner during the explainer scene in a horror movie of like what we're up against.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
Like the scientist is like, so basically an atomic chain reaction will happen.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
So now hold on doc in English.

22:34.000 --> 22:40.000
Are you saying the more these boogins attack us, the stronger they get.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
That's exactly it.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
Tyler and then Tyler just recedes into shadow.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
His job finished.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Boogins.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Okay.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Sorry about that.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Fucking we got to script that.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
There's a horror movie called The Boogins.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
If not, we should.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
We got to make that.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
And that's what you would get if you would be underground too long.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
You get the boogins.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Ain't no tissue underground.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
But you know we skipped over a course night of the living dead, which is like the more

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
like so far it's like not only ahead of its time, but then not heated where it's

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
like this big this low budget horror movie just like stakes its claim and goes like

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
they think talk about night of the living dead a lot is like this.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
That movie came out that must have been a racist nightmare because you have Dwayne

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
Dwayne Jones is like slapping the shit out of a white people killing white

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
zombies.

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
Just like he's just telling like it's just it's highly recommended.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
It's really, really good.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
But it's such resonant horror.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
That's the thing.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
And then we continue to do that with the zombie medium, not necessarily being kind

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
of a honestly aggressive about racial politics.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
For instance, we don't necessarily carry that tradition.

23:51.000 --> 23:57.000
But what we've identified as the attraction of the zombie medium is that it traps the

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
living under a microscope.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
It makes them have to deal with shit that we are already dealing with but are refusing

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
to confront.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
And but, you know, anyways, all right, we've made our guest way too long.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
He's a professor of African American women's poetry at Howard University.

24:15.000 --> 24:22.000
No, he's not.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
He's just a gangly white kid with a show on adult swim.

24:25.000 --> 24:38.000
Please welcome Brian Weissel-Mersky.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
This couch looks so comfortable.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
I love it that this you're using like the comfortable furniture as decoration.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
And a guest comes out and sits on this.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
That is a nice couch.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Yeah.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
You're looking real sharp, man.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Looking real good.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I'm not Justin Roiland.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
No.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
Well, did anyone promote that Justin was going to be on the show?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Oh, that was their mistake.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I saw that coming.

25:04.000 --> 25:12.000
Justin texted me at like fucking 3.30, like, I ate an edible at one.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
What's happening?

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
I thought it would be over by now.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
What's going on?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
My hands are getting so big.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I can't understand what.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
What am I? Who are you?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
What's going on?

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
I called Postmates and they came and I just let them drive away.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
That's how high I am.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Like he's like, like, like this is a sympathetic.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Oh, baby.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Are you okay?

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
I'm in somebody's house.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
I don't know how I got here.

25:44.000 --> 25:50.000
I was, I was just saying in the green room, I was like, like, you know, like, like, like,

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
you ever like, you have, you have friends and like you predict their bad behavior.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
And then if you predict it, you could get like super pissed at them.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
And it just struck me today while texting with Justin, who I knew two weeks ago was

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
not going to show up tonight.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
And I only didn't know the excuse would be eating an edible.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
I didn't text him today because I feared that.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
But I'm happy to be here.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
I'm excited.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
I mean, you're a swell guy.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
You'll be fine.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Imagine being him right now.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
So, you know, but that's, we were getting them on your side a little bit.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
I, I pounded a drink backstage when I found out.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Well, you should quit the show then.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
You should just bail entirely.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
You took a chemical.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Get out of here.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
That's the responsible thing to do.

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
Now Whitesville is like a genius that started a channel one on one and did like the most

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
amazing cartoons, just some of the funniest, most messed up stuff.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
I always loved it.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
And is that my popcorn?

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
No.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Okay.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
Steve Levy, ladies and gentlemen, Steve Levy.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
And now you're on your second season of Hot Streets.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Fuck.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
I'm so sorry.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Fuck.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
Having a goddamn panic attack.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Weed.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Nobody's ever died from weed.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Don't worry.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
I'm so itchy.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Whitesville is going to be so bummed too.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
This is a mess.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
I never usually do weed anymore, but I just felt so uncreative.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
And usually it helps me with that.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
But I guess not this stuff.

27:31.000 --> 27:39.000
What can I do to help?

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
You don't have to do anything.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
That's why you texted to get permission to bail.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
You got it.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
You don't have to feel bad about it, but I'm not going to figure out how to make you

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
feel great.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I understand.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
I feel like Mike Tyson is punching my heart.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I'm sorry for letting you down, Harmon.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
I'm sorry.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
I can't believe I have to talk to Weiss all by himself.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
I am.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Yes.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
So we were at channel one on one.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
That's where you started this.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Please tell us more about it.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Yeah.

28:15.000 --> 28:22.000
Well, I feel actually nostalgic sitting here with Dan and Rob because I think a lot of

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
people's stories that got involved with channel one on one, I think a lot of people were in

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
some sort of a personal despair.

28:29.000 --> 28:37.000
So I was very at a place, a breaking point in my life where I wasn't getting where I

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
wanted to be.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Can we just have two details?

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Two details.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Wipe your ass with a T-shirt.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
Well, one detail is first, I lived in Irvine.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
That's not a good detail.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
I mean, if you live in Irvine, that's not a good detail.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Shout out to Irvine.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Shout out to Irvine Company.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
Is that inland?

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Jesus, it's Orange County.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
It's like...

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Like Juggaloo's.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Yeah.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Yeah.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Yeah.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Why would you add...

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
Like, that's going to really make the story better.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Is it inland?

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Yes.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Oh.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Oh.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Oh.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
Oh, my God.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Wow.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
So many colors.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
And music.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
It's inland.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Oh, my God.

29:26.000 --> 29:33.000
If I take a flyer out of the idea that I don't belong up here, can we stop investigating

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
that?

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
I know I'm a bad interviewer.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Is it inland?

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Is it inland?

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Did anybody think that?

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Is that inland?

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Nobody.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
I just...

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Nobody was questioning.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Ah.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Ah, is it...

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Is it...

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
I guess what I meant was...

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Outlander inland.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
You got to give me some more, buddy.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
I don't know what planet I'm on.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
What year is it?

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
I mean, Jesus Christ.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
I mean, come on.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Is it Tuesday?

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Can I get prize with that?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Come on.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Is it inland or what?

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
I imagine Grand Theft Auto 5.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Is it in the neighborhood that...

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
What's his name?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Is it in the guy that stops the guy's head?

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Is it in the...

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
You know, there's like your...

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Right.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
The GTA game where you're the three guys.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
You know, one of them is one of them...

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
What's the second detail?

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Is that like a...

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
The bald guy?

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
The creepy guy?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Yeah.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Hey, come on.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Hey, what the fuck?

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
I'm getting there.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
I'm getting there, so...

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
So, what's detail number two?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Oh, geez.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
Watch me make this podcast great by not interrupting.

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
Well, this detail for me was bad, but it's not necessarily...

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
Like, I feel bad because, like, I was working in property management.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
For me, it's not the job for me.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
So, like, I'm not putting down the job.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
It's just like I hated my job and I hated my life.

30:50.000 --> 30:57.000
I was living in Irvine and I did not feel like I was surrounded by similar types of people,

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
creative people, and I wanted to be a writer that wasn't working out.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
I wanted to get into MFA programs that wasn't working out.

31:05.000 --> 31:13.000
So, one day I got really high and I was watching Adult Swim, and I've always been a fan of Adult Swim,

31:13.000 --> 31:23.000
and I saw that only two people had animated Aquatine Hunger Force,

31:23.000 --> 31:29.000
so then I researched animation software and I just taught myself how to animate.

31:29.000 --> 31:38.000
And when I found Channel 101, I became a fan of a lot of the creators, like Twiggers and...

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
And the old baby fucker over here.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
Oh, Daryl.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
Come on, we just got out of that drama.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
There's no out of it.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
So, you taught yourself how to animate.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
Yes, I taught myself how to animate by kind of tracing old cartoons.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
What was your first software?

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
It was called Digicel, it was really bad, it was really unintuitive,

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
and I was watching Channel 101, I was a fan of the content,

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
and I wanted to be a writer, but I was a fiction writer,

32:09.000 --> 32:16.000
and the thing that sucks about being a writer is nobody wants to read what you're writing.

32:16.000 --> 32:22.000
So, if you make something that you can watch, you know, that is a lot more entertaining.

32:22.000 --> 32:29.000
So, I taught myself how to animate, and what was cool is I was living in Orange County,

32:29.000 --> 32:37.000
and I felt a bit lonely, and I began submitting to Channel 101, and I felt...

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
What was your first show, do you remember?

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
Oh my god, it's terrible, it was called Space Goblins.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Oh yes.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
And I think, I believe, am I mistaken in that, like, people, when that came out,

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
people were like, this is the downfall of Channel 101.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
I think we said that a lot about a lot of stuff.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
There's been a lot of downfall.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
Channel 101 was like, I mean, I always liken it to punk rock,

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
I mean, that's probably flattering us culturally, but like, relative to what we were doing,

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
a bunch of nerds making short films, it was always punk rock,

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
so that meant that people, it's like, well, who's doing what next?

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
Oh, this guy just threw his own shit at the audience,

33:12.000 --> 33:17.000
and you're like, so every single month, it was like, well, that's it then,

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
then now Channel 101's jump the shark, and then someone else would say,

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
no, it's just beginning, and everyone was wrong.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
It was just a great place for people to...

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
How many shows did you do at 101?

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Can you name them all?

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
Oh my god, no, probably about, I think, probably at least 10 to 15, I think.

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
How many of those got picked up for more than one episode?

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
It's funny because like, Channel 101, there's a trajectory,

33:42.000 --> 33:48.000
usually there's, you begin submitting, you get rejected, you get better.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.000
I felt that I was getting better, and what was cool is because like,

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
you're competing against your friends, which is cool about Channel 101,

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
is you respect the people that you're up against,

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
and you want to make something really good,

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
and I kept trying to make something better, but I think I became...

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
It was always a win-win.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
Also, I'm sure all animation shared this,

34:13.000 --> 34:21.000
you and Justin and Siobhan and the guys, the animation crews,

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
they suffered always the same kind of curse,

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
which is that you guys are animators, so you're weirder,

34:30.000 --> 34:35.000
and so you're making shit that's even more off the hinge a little bit,

34:35.000 --> 34:40.000
and people would tend to purposely not vote for stuff

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
because they could tell from watching something,

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
that guy's not going anywhere.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
He's going to be back here with a new pilot next month.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I always voted like that.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I don't know if I ever voted for anything you did.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
And Justin too.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
Justin would come in with something, it would just be called Skin Scrapers.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
Hi, I'm Johnny Skin Scrape.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
Uh-oh, I'm going to scrape my skin now.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Oh, the skin's off.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
Oh, hey, hey, what are you doing with that skin?

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
I'm going to eat it.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Oh, no, he's eating my skin.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Oh, no, oh, no.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
And the audience would just be like, this is the fucking best.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Fuck you, mom and dad.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Fuck you, gym teacher.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
Fuck you, Jimmy Carter, whoever was president.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Jimmy Carter.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
What?

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Shout out to Sprinkles.

35:27.000 --> 35:35.000
But it was really like, it was like, fuck you, CAA, fuck you, UTA, fuck you, casting directors, fuck you, system.

35:35.000 --> 35:43.000
I came out here with a steamer trunk from the Midwest or Irvine and I'm ready to work

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
and you would have me just sit out here and put a gun in my mouth

35:47.000 --> 35:52.000
and you deserve what you're seeing on screen right now.

35:52.000 --> 35:57.000
That was the real joy and I would never vote for Justin's stuff.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I wanted him to make a new pilot.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
So how many shows did you make by yourself?

36:03.000 --> 36:10.000
How many shows did you make before you got picked up?

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
How many pilots did you make?

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
Not very many because a lot of people's trajectory was that they would start a channel 101,

36:15.000 --> 36:20.000
they would get better and I felt that I was getting better but not getting voted in.

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
Was it past the pigs?

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
That was your House of Cosby's.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
House of Cosby's was successful.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
No, past the pigs got voted back several times.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Was that the first one?

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
No, I got invited back once.

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
Was that Hot Cross Buns?

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
That didn't get voted back but I thought that was a really good one.

36:45.000 --> 36:52.000
I made this video called Hot Cross Buns and I thought that it was really good.

36:52.000 --> 36:58.000
Let's talk about the relationship between this willful stupidity.

36:58.000 --> 37:06.000
What I like about you and Justin is that I get caught in spirals of overthought.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
It's the death of all fun things and stuff.

37:09.000 --> 37:17.000
My heroes like Schrab, Royland, you're carrying that torch.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
I'm fascinated by you guys and therefore I never want to ask you questions

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
because I feel like I'll just soil you with overthought.

37:24.000 --> 37:30.000
Wait, is that bad on purpose?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Don't ask that question.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
What is the difference for you?

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
Do you make decisions and go like, I'm going to make this a little shittier?

37:37.000 --> 37:43.000
Well, I think that's funny because that's never quite my purpose

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
is to make something shittier.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
I think he's trying to do it.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Don't high road me in front of these people.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
You know your style is obviously very organic.

37:51.000 --> 37:56.000
So when you made this macaroni cheese, you thought I'll just add these fucking raisins.

37:56.000 --> 38:01.000
You were like, I'm going to paint this wall and then I'll just smear some shit on it.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Is that how you do it?

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
Well, I think it's funny because the Hot Street season one came out

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
and people were saying that the animation is bad on purpose.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
But I was really working hard on a small budget.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
So it's funny.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
But you know, they're not talking about the quality of the animation.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
They're talking about the blocking, the choreography.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
You surely must...

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Maybe you're not.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Maybe you're David Lynch.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
You don't know that you're weird.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Is that what we're learning?

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
You don't know you're weird?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
I don't know that I'm weird.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
All right. Well, that's it. I'm glad I asked.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
I'm a good interviewer. I'm glad I interrupted.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
All right. Okay.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
But it's like, I remember like Space Goblins.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
It was like, I mean, we were rolling on the floor.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
There was like a process where we watched the submissions

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
and it would be like everybody who won from last month would be in charge of like

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
who their competitors were basically.

38:53.000 --> 38:59.000
And so we'd screen all these analog tapes that would be dropped in our mailbox.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
And I remember Space Goblins.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
I remember the introduction to your style,

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
which was like characters that are going like,

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
like they're walking into frame.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
And you use the tinkle-toes sound effect from Hanna-Barbera.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
And then someone goes,

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
my name is John Spaceman.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I'm going to go do this now.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
And then like, and then, yeah, like I kind of like,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
I would call like the Doug Lucen Hope camp,

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
like the, you know, the editor from Tim and Eric,

39:28.000 --> 39:34.000
it's like that just pre-millennial like fucking like

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
late Beastie Boy's lateral absurdity.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
See, I overanalyze shit.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
And you're like, I'm just trying to,

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
my heart is to do something from the heart.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
And then everyone's like, Harmon's fucking evil.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
He called that guy weird.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
But you're just, you know, you're making,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
you know, it's funny that the guy's like,

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
that's not, that the guy's like,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
this is the name of the show.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Give me back my baby.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
What was the...

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Oh, Bearded Traveler.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
Bearded Traveler.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
But he was, he was, he was like,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
it was like the title sequence was like,

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
and then he would say, give me back my baby.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
That was his catchphrase.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
And it was like a show about a guy

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
who just wanted his baby back.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Yeah.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Bearded Traveler is my favorite.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
And that was it.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
But give me back my baby.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
What was nice is like when I made,

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
I made the, I made that show.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
And actually Justin emailed me

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
on the Channel 101 forums.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
I met him before to animate Doc and Marty.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
But I was working on the, on that show,

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
on that Channel 101 show.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
Ooh.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Ooh.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
That's a bitch.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Bet you're kicking yourself.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Bet you're kicking yourself.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Because the guy's that anime.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
And look at the Bearded Traveler now.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Bearded Traveler is amazing.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Yeah.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I like the Bearded Traveler.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
And you were very nice to me because I...

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
What's that like?

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I met the, what?

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
After I met, I met,

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
I think I met Dan before I met Rob.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
But after the Bearded Traveler screened,

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
you came up to me and you said that you,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
you thought that like I had a unique style

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
and it meant a lot to me.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
So I, I just...

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
You've got a unique style.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
No, I think you, well you, I mean,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
you said that you thought that I could eventually

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
have a TV show.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
I was right.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Why are you laughing at that?

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
I know.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Well because I said,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
I just had like a fucking cockbacker.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I got a unique style.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
I just pictured me in like a crown and a robe.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
I was like, you have a unique style, boy.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
He said, he said it meant a lot to him.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Just take it.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
I know.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
No, I wasn't taking it away from...

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Oh no.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
By making...

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
He doesn't even know.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
He doesn't even know.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
What you think he's gonna say now?

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Of course, of course he's gonna be like,

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
I'm fine, Mr. Harmon.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
It's like you just threw me and Joe Green's jersey back at him.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
This dude comes in and he says,

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
you said something nice to me and you go,

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
I was right.

42:04.000 --> 42:09.000
Did I mention my dick?

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
We're probably not, by the way,

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
like, by the way, this is Weissall.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Do you go by Weissall now?

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Is that like your prince name?

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
Well, that's a good question because all throughout,

42:19.000 --> 42:24.000
I mean, I've always introduced myself as Brian

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
and people call me Weissall, which is fine.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
When I was a child, when I was a kid,

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
people would call me Weissall.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
In the Rick and Morty's writer's room,

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
I would be called Weissall.

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
I think what it was is that Cass,

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
which was my friend in my Channel 101,

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
the guy who had cast in all of my shows

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
in the early Channel 101 days, called me Weissall.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Introduced me to everybody as Weissall,

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
but I always feel really self-conscious about that.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
It feels like branding.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
Yeah, like, I'm Speed Demon Johnson.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
My name is Brian, but please call me Speed Demon.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Right, right.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
I always feel really uncomfortable about that,

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
but if you call me Weissall, I like it.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
It's fine, but I also go by Brian.

43:12.000 --> 43:19.000
And the show we're plugging is Hot Streets on Adult Swim.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
It already had a first season.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
It had a first season.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
Jesus Christ, they'll run anything.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
I haven't even seen this fucking thing,

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
but I know one thing for sure.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
It's got a guy doing tinkle toes

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
and something you're going to pretend isn't weird on purpose.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
It's a good show.

43:37.000 --> 43:42.000
So you got picked up for a second season.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
Yes, you got picked up for a second season.

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
I'll really have to sit down and watch Atlanta,

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
and then watch this.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
I used your story circle.

43:52.000 --> 43:57.000
Yeah, that's always so evident.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
I'm really proud of the second season of the show.

44:00.000 --> 44:06.000
So how do you get it from Channel 101 to Adult Swim?

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
Yeah, I'd like to know.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Show us that ladder.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
Kate Freund, who is married to Rob Schrobb.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
Gross.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Shout out to Kate.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Shout out to Kate.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Brave woman.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
She...

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
We wish her luck tonight.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
She passed my name to some people

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
that was able to get me...

44:29.000 --> 44:34.000
This is really weird because I got my break on Smosh.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Choke up just a little bit.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
I'm sorry?

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Thank you.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Oh, yeah, got it.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Thank you.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
Yes, Smosh.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Smosh.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Kate gave my name to some producers,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
and I got the attention of Smosh.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Do you know what Smosh is?

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
What is Smosh?

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
Smosh?

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
What's it called?

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
It's getting more marketing than Adult Swim tonight.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Well, like Smosh?

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
Smosh?

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
Ten years ago, it was like the premier destination

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
for teen and tween entertainment,

45:05.000 --> 45:11.000
and honestly, I had made fun of them for a long time

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
because I didn't think they were funny at all,

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
and they gave me my break,

45:17.000 --> 45:25.000
and it turns out that they were really cool, nice people,

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
and I feel really bad, but...

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Yeah.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
All right, so we meet people at Smosh.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
They love you, and then how does that go to Adult Swim?

45:36.000 --> 45:42.000
It went from the people at Smosh got me a management

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
and all that kind of thing,

45:44.000 --> 45:49.000
and then I was already friends with Justin, of course,

45:49.000 --> 45:55.000
so my management team connected me with Stupid Buddy

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
who makes robot chicken,

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
and then we flew.

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
Justin, Seth Green, and all of the robot chicken people,

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
we all flew out to Atlanta and pitched it directly to Adult Swim,

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
which is pretty cool.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Incredible.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
The Wrecking Crew, that's what I call you guys.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
You, Seth Green, and Justin.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
There goes the Wrecking Crew.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
The Wrecking Crew.

46:20.000 --> 46:26.000
Weisel, have you heard about this conspiracy theory

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
that Donald Trump is a time traveler?

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
I have not, and I really want to hear about this.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
Dan, you just...

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
This is fresh in your palate, and it's your show.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
Why don't you explain?

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
All right, well, there's this author.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
There's a YouTube video that's like an hour.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
So you know it's for real?

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
Yeah.

46:48.000 --> 46:55.000
It's called The Last President.

46:55.000 --> 46:59.000
The Last President, what a 127-year-old book reveals

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
about Donald Trump time travel and Nikola Tesla.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
And I'm only like 20 minutes into it,

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
but it's like there was a book by an author called...

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
What's his name?

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
Engelsack Humper Nut?

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Humper Nut.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
Engelsack Humper Nut.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
Some guy wrote a book in like 1896.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
He wrote a series of books about a character,

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
a bratty little kid called Baron Trump,

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
who he's like a privileged son of like a dynasty,

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
and he...

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
His father's name is Don.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Well, his mentor is the Don.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Oh, okay, all right.

47:38.000 --> 47:43.000
But the Baron Trump in his second book,

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
which is called 1900, The Future...

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
The Last President.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
The Last President.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
Baron Trump becomes president.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
And one of his cabinet members is named Pence.

47:57.000 --> 48:03.000
And Baron Trump in the book goes to Russia,

48:03.000 --> 48:08.000
where there's caves that lead to the center of the earth,

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
where there's a secret civilization made of silver.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
The guy interjects in the YouTube video to talk about,

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
by the way, it's worth noting that in these specific caves

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
that are cited in this story, they have found these weird nanofibers

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
that are like inexplicable and stuff.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Like, I'm going to call this guy...

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Like, I really don't want to offend this guy,

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
because I really respect...

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Like, I'm listening to him and I'm like...

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
I'm a believer.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
I'm a believer, man.

48:35.000 --> 48:40.000
And I also don't want to offend anyone who has any...

48:40.000 --> 48:44.000
is grappling with any kind of chemical complication.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
I think you just insulted him.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Well, no...

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
I don't want to insult him. He's all smart.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I don't want to insult people with brains.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
But I don't think that the guy is like...

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
He's not like Harrison Ford is like trying to melt my testicles with satellites,

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
you know, because I saw it in the Amway manual.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
When did Harrison Ford tell us this?

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Yes.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
He's not like unhealthily like...

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
He's not diagnosable in any way,

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
as far as this YouTube video is concerned.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
He's like, this guy is like clearly like kind of a hobbyist

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
into this thing.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
You're saying, no, he's a cuckoo bird.

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
No, no, no. I'm saying go on, continue.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Well, I just wanted to say,

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
because I feel weird when I talk about people that I haven't met

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
and I always want to say to those people,

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
like if I'm offending you, if this gets back to you,

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
you know, like to come on the show.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Oh, fuck, yeah.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
Get to the testicles.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Whoever this guy is, if it somehow gets back to you,

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
as it tends to in the most negative of ways,

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
I really am not dogging on you and not making fun of you.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
Like, we're very interested in your YouTube video.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
It is crazy.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
I hope that's not offensive to you.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
But this book exists, apparently.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
I'm not going to read it, but I'm sure,

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
apparently, it exists, that it was all this stuff.

50:03.000 --> 50:09.000
The Don lives in an apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York,

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
where Trump is.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Well, so President Trump goes into the center of the earth,

50:12.000 --> 50:17.000
in Russia, and he accidentally time-travels

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
through time, as one does.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Yeah.

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
Then that ties into a story that may be apocryphal or not

50:25.000 --> 50:30.000
about Nikola Tesla, who one day walked into a tavern, you said?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Yeah, he walks into a tavern, and he's all messed up.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
His hair's like crooked, and he's like,

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
and a friend's like, no, Tess, man.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
Tessy.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
Tess, what's going on?

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
What's going on, brother?

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
There was an accident, and the machine.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
I was able to see past, present, and future all at the same time.

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
I think I created a time machine.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
And they went, oh, OK.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
So there's that story that's out there somewhere.

50:56.000 --> 51:02.000
But later on, when Tesla died, the FBI came in

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
and just took all of his stuff, all of his notes,

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
all of his stuff.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
They just came in and took it.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
Apparently, this is the legend or whatever the conspiracy

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
or whatever it is.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
They looked through all this stuff, and they go, Bill,

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
do you know what this means?

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
No, I don't know what that means, Nigel.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
And then Bill and Nigel were two guys there.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
I love it.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
Yeah.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
And they didn't know.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
They couldn't decipher what it was.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
They said, well, let's get some smart guy to come in here

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
and take a look at this.

51:29.000 --> 51:34.000
And the guy they hired was Trump's uncle.

51:34.000 --> 51:39.000
As the legend goes.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
And so do they have this machine?

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
Yes.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
Well, the proof is they said that the guy eventually says,

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
I think it's that video.

51:48.000 --> 51:54.000
He says, well, time travel affects your mind.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
It screws you up.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
It deteriorates your brain.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
And that's why Trump talks the way he does.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
It's because of time travel.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
And that's why he misspelled Barron Trump's name,

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
because there's two Rs in the book instead of one.

52:09.000 --> 52:15.000
So like Donald Trump, we're just watching.

52:15.000 --> 52:25.000
We're at the end of a world that has been retro pre-destroyed

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
by a time-traveling nincompoop who,

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
and he probably doesn't even remember

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
how to time travel anymore.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
So now he's just hanging out.

52:34.000 --> 52:39.000
So if Dr. Hoot was an idiot and didn't care about not fucking up time,

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
this is the world we would be living in.

52:41.000 --> 52:50.000
Because he kind of explains a lot more than if the stuff didn't exist.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
It reminds me of the Ford and the Lincoln and the Kennedy thing,

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
which is...

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
What's that?

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
Kennedy was killed in a Lincoln.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
Lincoln was killed in Ford's theater.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
Both had shots to the head.

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
Both fucked Marilyn Monroe.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
Someone had a secretary named Johnson.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
One had a Johnson named Secretary.

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
Well, this is what the conspiracy theorists say,

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
that the Illuminati are the powers to be or whatever,

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
they're putting all these clues being out in the open

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
because they're arrogant, they're going,

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
here, look, doesn't Biff Tannen look from back to the future?

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
That's like the spackle on the logic of conspiracy theories.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
It's like, well, why would they, because they're fucking with us.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Yeah, man.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
Thank God the Illuminati are always just fucking with everybody.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
Or we wouldn't be able to explain quite all of this.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Yeah, covers a lot of plot holes.

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
I like David, I watch the Illuminati videos where they show

53:52.000 --> 53:58.000
just a montage of celebrities in moments of mind laps or whatever.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
When the reptilian eyes show.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
Yeah, or just like the craziness though,

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
like Will Smith's talking and then they go like,

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
yeah, but so when's your next movie coming out?

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
And he just goes like, ha, ha, ha, ha.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
Anyway, and they just do that.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
You just watch 45 minutes of that because,

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
but it's like, it's like, I like, I like, it's like,

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
I think that's, that might be a healthier hobby

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
for a middle-aged man than toy trains.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
Like, yeah, think about how the world might be fucked up

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
and engineered to manipulate you.

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
Like, don't just recede into a Digicell app

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
and like try to make a squiggly cartoon.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
All right, let's get to know you a little bit.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
So what do you think?

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
What do you think?

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
What do you think, Weissal?

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
What's your take on all this?

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
Weissal, come on.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
Oh, Brian.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I'm going to a new area.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
I'm going to talk about Weiser,

54:56.000 --> 55:01.000
because like I find myself like,

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
do you find yourself just getting really mad?

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
And you're like, I'm online and I'm like,

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
I'm listening to this really bad Africa cover

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
and I get really mad.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
That is some bullshit.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Can we say that that is some bullshit?

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Yeah, it's some bullshit.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
Don't fucking remake it and take out all the fun.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
So, yes, it's like, but also at the same time,

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
like I get really mad at the internet.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
I get really, I just want to rage and like,

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
I fucking hate this Africa remake

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
and I hate the Rosanna one is even worse.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
And I just want to go on the internet

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
and just talk about it.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
But at the same time,

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
like everything has become so black and white

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
that like it's like,

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Weiser fucking sucks.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
They've never been good.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
And then I was like,

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
wait, wait, wait, wait.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
Can you go back to talking about the baby stuff?

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
I'm trying to get away from that.

55:58.000 --> 56:02.000
They're going to fucking burn the building down.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
And then like you're watching,

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
and then like I was in my car

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
and then the sweater sank out came on.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
I was like, this song's pretty good.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
They're not like complete shit, you know?

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
So like everything's gray anymore.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
Everything's just like attack or defense.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
And also like 15 years from now,

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
like you just don't know,

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
like somehow some way your opinion about Weiser,

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
it may somehow like dent you, right?

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
Or am I, that's not what you were leading to at all.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
And I'm just like stuck in my own like fucking weird world over here.

56:39.000 --> 56:44.000
Well, I mean, I think I'll continue to dislike Weiser,

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
but it's not that they're completely evil,

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
horrible people that need to be destroyed.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
It's just they made, they made a song that's

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
and maybe an album of several albums that suck really bad,

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
but they're not like evil people.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
Okay.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
What is the biggest change for you since this is a weird question,

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
but since you did sort of quickly move up the ranks,

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
what was the hardest thing to get used to for Dan?

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
For Dan, it was being famous for you.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
What is it?

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
He's 48 by the way.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
And okay, I'm sorry.

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
I'm pretty close to that because we just found out that's feasible,

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
but it took it.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
It took a little while.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
It took a while, but then once it started,

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
it I'll say like when I got my first job as a writer,

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
I was 37 and I was Rick and Jesus Christ.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
You really are really old.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
Yes.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
Yeah.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
So like that was my first job was my first professional writing job was

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
Rick and Morty and I was 37.

57:43.000 --> 57:49.000
And I think my the, the no matter what age you are,

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
when you go into a writer's room and you're brand new,

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
you're inside of your head.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
So I think like you're in the writer's room.

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
Like I haven't talked enough today or you get kind of get inside

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
your head too much.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
And now toward the end of the season,

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
I felt like, all right, I know how to contribute to the show.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
And now I'm on a show and I worked on a couple of other shows after that.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
And then Hot Streets, I'm running the writer's room.

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
And now I see all the bad habits that I was doing.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Like, give me one.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
Like, it's like you're waiting for your turn.

58:25.000 --> 58:30.000
You're like, somebody is talk is giving an idea and they stop talking.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
You're like, and then you go backwards five minutes ago.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
Cause you're in your head.

58:34.000 --> 58:39.000
You're like, all right, if Rick and Morty, like if, if they,

58:39.000 --> 58:44.000
if they did this, then that was a great pitch, right?

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
You get inside your own head, I think is the problem.

58:48.000 --> 58:54.000
And so when, when I became the show runner for my show,

58:54.000 --> 58:59.000
I saw that happening with, with, I've seen that happen with other,

58:59.000 --> 59:04.000
another, not just, I mean, Jesus, the writers on Hot Streets are incredible.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
So I'm not, I'm not talking bad about them.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
But I've worked on other shows since Rick and Morty where like,

59:09.000 --> 59:15.000
you see that happening and you want to, I think the key is to just

59:15.000 --> 59:21.000
succumb yourself to the show and to embrace what is happening and to

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
build up what is happening from other writers.

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
You want to help them because you're the greater good as the show.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
But when you're a new writer, I think the problem is you get inside

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
your own head and just want to like, I've got my own ideas.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I want to put my own voice in the show.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
I think that's okay.

59:37.000 --> 59:43.000
I, I, I, I envy you if what you are achieving is like an actual exercise

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
where people are just keeping the shuttlecock in the air.

59:46.000 --> 59:53.000
And so you're not even bothering to like, but, but if that is one extreme

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
and the other extreme is nobody listening to anybody and they just have their own ideas,

59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
somewhere in the middle is kind of like, yeah, as long as you don't

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000
shoot down other people's ideas, that's what makes me just go, fuck you.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Like, like, like, like that means like, like you're sitting there listening

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
to other people's ideas and trying to figure out why they won't work.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Dude, ideas don't work because God hates us.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
We're here to beat him.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Like, like, like, like, like, you're on the wrong side of the law.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
If you're sitting here trying to figure out how that person's pitch isn't going to work.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I don't care if it's about boogers or fucking whatever.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Like, support it until it dies of overindulgence.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
But ideas are a gift.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
But I think it's okay.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I mean, I thought, well, for my money and my shitty writer's room that probably

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:46.000
works much slower than yours is like, I don't mind people ratcheting back a little

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
bit and going like, well, listen to that person talk for four minutes trying to get

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
their idea out.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
And I, but what I wanted to say about what we were talking about is this other thing.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Like, I don't, I just see, you know, I don't, I never saw that as a sin.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I would expect that.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I don't, I wouldn't want people to leave shit behind in a ditch just because

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Right.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Timothy, like, decided to make everything about Wizard of Oz.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I agree with you.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
And I would say like ideas are a gift.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
But I felt like when I was working at Rick and Morty, I felt that I would

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I felt that I was too inside of my head.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Right.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
You caught yourself not listening to other people enough.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Right.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
That's what you're saying.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Right.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000
And when I've worked with people, not just writing, but like, I season two, we were able

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000
to kind of, I guess the problem going from season one to season two is season one is

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I don't quite know how to be, how to run the show.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
So I've got certain lieutenants that I'm listening to and

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000
And they're just going to stab you in the back and go do a fucking Marvel show about

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Loki.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Okay.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
All right.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
All right.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Oh my God.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Be happy for your friends for once.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Be happy.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
We're all fucking trying to figure it out.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Somebody did something nice happens to somebody and you, you got to tear them down.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
You got to tear them apart.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Jesus Christ.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
What's wrong with you?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I just said.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Waldron was there for two weeks.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I like I got it.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I got it.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I got it.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
I got to train people slower.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
My God.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I got the fire.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
He did the work.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
He got the job.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Be happy for him.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
What?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Don't high road me.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
What are you doing?

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
How dare you?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
No one's happier for him than me.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
You know a little bit because you're running your second season, right?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
That's that's going to be you show running deep.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
What would you tell him?

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Because it's a.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
What would I tell?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Who?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Low key low key.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Oh, what would you tell Brian?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Because he took sense.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
You tell him anything.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Well, he just said he's not so sure.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Is there a piece because I like it's cool about this show is that you do talk about the process

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000
and I do think people want to know how it all gets made sometimes.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Yeah, but it's I mean it's a goddamn nightmare.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I for me the central thing about it is always the wondering when you're supposed to be overthinking

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
and when you're supposed to be under thinking, especially in a show like Rick and Morty where

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:23.000
it's like, you know, to me very clear that it's the key recipe is that it's a swirl of

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:31.000
two things that don't usually work well together, which is like willful stupidity and an absolute

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
like passionate like over thought.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.000
And I so we sit in the writer's room and we we I don't know we try to break stories,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
but we also like have these at the top of every season we go.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Let's do things real differently this time around.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
You know, let's let's let's escape this process and let's do another one.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
It's just this because two to three was a whole different room.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Yeah, I mean they're always they're always they're always real different rooms and your

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
it's everything's the experiment is never over.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
You're never comfortable.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
You're never nailing it.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
You never it's like you just dream of this day.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000
It's like the myth of retirement like the myth of the writer's room that like has its shit together

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
where you're like, OK, well, we know what our job is.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
We make pizza, right?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
People like the cheese like the tomato sauce.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Oh shit, all of the unexpected things have to do with our babies and medical emergencies.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I got to go home at four instead of five.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
It never happens.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
It's always like, OK, you're you're behind schedule.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:39.000
And and why did this story about a banana peel turn out to be our citizen cane or ishtar?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Like what what are we doing wrong?

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:50.000
It's funny because like whatever brings you like joy in the room like for us, we were in our writer's room.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Man, I don't know how to talk about this, but like I guess there's this.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:10.000
There's this sexual fetish of people liking like cartoon horses like party party party on people's faces.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000
We're all hanging in every word waiting for you to the joke is bringing it back to the thing that everybody.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
What's that?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
What's the term?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
What's like if I wanted to Google?

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I don't know.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
It's not what I mean.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:32.000
It's like, you know, we in our room, we were watching like for us, like you just follow whatever the joy is of the moment.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
For us and I like horses.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Yeah, but cartoon horses are even better.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:46.000
If you like, you know, if you are aroused by my little ponies farting in faces, that's totally cool.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
But like it's some fetishes are kind of amusing at the same time.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Like what?

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Like the ponies farting in faces.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Also, Pokemon is a big on the farting on people.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:12.000
So like the videos start with like either the my little pony or or the Pokemon slowly approaching backwards to the create to the character.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Right.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:20.000
And I feel like they start with a lot of self hate.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Get up on that mic.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
So tell us about that room.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Tell us about that room.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
So we're like, we have to write an episode, but it has to be serious.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Like if the pony farts in your face, you die.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:39.000
So it's like the things that make you laugh in the room oftentimes will help create that story.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Yeah.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
I don't know.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Completely went away from what we were talking about.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Yeah.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I mean, look, I it's a conversation about a thing that is so frustrating for the same reason that it's like the conversation about it is almost tedious, let alone inaccessible, because it's like, that's the problem.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000
And I've always agonized about this because I'm like, hopefully going to retire soon.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:14.000
And I spent my life working, I'm going to go ahead and say it as hard as a carpenter works with wood.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
But with stories.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Oh, fuck you people.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
No, but I mean, like I've said it over and over again.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:30.000
It's like the fucked up thing is that from the from the beginning of the first moment when two people got to two pieces of wood and said, let's make a porch.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Like the first time don't don't act like I don't know architecture.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
The first time that they figured out is just two pieces.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
They're going to start on the porch Brandon.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
You don't.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
That's the fucking steps.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
The first I know what it is.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
They've never made it before.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
That's my point.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
That's my point.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
What's a porch?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
You got a piece of wood.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
That's my point.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Well, those will be the steps that we got to get some more wood to make the porch.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:21.000
You can get online right now and type I need to make a porch into Googlepedia and you will be able to draw on 5000 years of people making shit with wood, right?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Every time a joist gets invented or discovered, there's like racks of shit at Home Depot and there's time life books and there's people sharing notes.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
And when things don't work, they don't make the cut.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
That's right.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
And they evaporate.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:43.000
So when you have something as simple as like making a house that people live in or making a porch swing, you have this like memetic evolution where people compare notes and share what they've learned.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:56.000
And with breaking stories, which to me is agonizing and no one wants to do it, I don't want to spend eight hours a day knowing only one thing, which is that I don't know what to do next.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
It's like, what the fuck you, man?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I'm entitled to more than that.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I want a Sunday and a hand job right now.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Okay, like when is story, like my career is like propelled by this like will to laziness.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
And then I never, I'm like, there's got to be an easy way to do this.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Joseph Campbell must know, okay, Jesus Christ, this guy talks a lot.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Oh, fuck.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
God damn it.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Okay.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Maybe if I break it down, it's like I never, like I can never figure it out.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I can never work smarter, not harder.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:39.000
That's why I'm so frustrated also by the technology involving interactive whiteboards, which I know we have, but we don't have because there's no demand for it.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
We're in the golden age of television.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000
144 pieces of wood.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Is what it takes to make a porch.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
No, to run a writer's room.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
To make a, what do you think?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
What were we talking?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Yeah.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
All right.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:10.000
We should be able to know like how it's like I like if I if I could go back in time through a Russian tunnel.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
What?

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:27.000
And and simply just be able to access from 2009 onward all of the work on every single community episode Rick and Morty episode like just be able to look at just the strokes on the whiteboard in order and all that stuff to be able to like pour

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:33.000
over that with the same amount of facility that we can pour over our baby's photos are our weddings and stuff like that.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Like we have the digital technology, but we don't we somehow regard this idea that writers work in writer's rooms.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000
We regarded as if it's some kind of like there's like this blind spot there where we're like, well, that's none of your business.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
How we get our shit done.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000
But it's like, wait a minute, man, we're all working towards like a common goal here.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:00.000
If you figured it out how you can do it in two minutes, then we could start accelerating our our television culture, right?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Like true, but all artists do that.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
All artists hide their process, which is interesting that you let us in.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:13.000
That's why I was always trying to push because yeah if you you use joists, but the truth of the matter is with carbon tree, the joinery is hidden.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
So like some dudes are not using metal at all.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Some dudes are using just pegs.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Some dudes are just using a dowel.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:26.000
There's always this thing of like if you look at this stage right now, you don't see a nail because carpenters don't show you how they make stuff.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
That's the game.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
That's what the Masons are built on is the entire crime.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Well, the Masons that was their first impulse was like, wait, oh, are you thinking what I'm thinking?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Yeah, we know how to make a doorway not fall on your head when you over the door.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Well, fucking how about we keep this from people until the next election?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Yeah, you're right.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
That's there's first instinct.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000
To be honest, even when you're painting, you're trying to use paints that nobody else can get their hands on.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I don't like that impulse.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
I don't like it.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
And I don't think it's because I'm a noble person.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I think it's because I'm so fucking much more narcissistic than other creatives.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I actually like in my head and I think this is changing now.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I'm 46, but I think I'm like, I think in my 25 year old like Max Landesey brain.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
I think that.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Not this weekend.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Not this weekend.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I think that like my goal has always been like, let's just eliminate all this fucking shit that has nothing to do with talent.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And then just have a fucking dick measuring contest.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
It's just like, who came out of the womb more special?

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
What's with all this?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Michigan's getting in the way.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
You know, like, like how hard it is to figure this and that out.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:39.000
But like, I don't think that way anymore because it's like, it's like, it's like digging through a cotton candy mountain, like looking for a, you know what?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Bad writer.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Like, where was that going to go?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.000
What I could use is a good room full of talented collaborators that I wish I knew how to use.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Not here.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Did you go through a process?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Weissall or speed demon is where we've come to call you.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Like my big lesson on community was that I threw this like idea of, well, I don't want to be an asshole.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:09.000
So I'm not going to make them do anything which is abusing them.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Like, did you, I don't know how big your writing staff is.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
We had a pretty small writer's room we had.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I think like five writers and all.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
So did you ever do this thing where you're like, hold up and going like, I'll just write the script.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000
You guys eat some M&Ms.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:35.000
It would, it was usually, I mean, like even on Rick and Morty, I think I felt like the first couple of hours is just kind of like dicking around, you know?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:46.000
And then you just eventually, actually, like I used to, I was listening to Harmontown and then when I got to Rick and Morty, it was just kind of like dicking.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
It was kind of like, you know.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
What happens on the show?

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I think there's a little bit of warm up that occurs.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
So you're just kind of having fun as a group.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:08.000
And sometimes you'll find something that sparks pleasure and you try to find what that pleasure is and how to get to it.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000
And how, like, I think in season two was a get schwifty song.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
We all thought it was funny.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Like, how do we write a story for that?

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Because that brings us a lot of pleasure.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Yeah.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Yeah.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Yeah.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Never nailed it.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
There's no formula.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Don't know how to do it.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Do you think that's why artists and carpenters try to hide what they do?

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Because if we knew, if we saw, like to me, like I always tell my parents or people who aren't in the business, if you saw what I did, if you looked at what I would do, you would go, you're doing nothing.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
You're just fucking around all day.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
But it's not true.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I mean, like, when you're not writing, you're thinking about writing or you're outlining or you're writing or whatever, or you're doing a lot of, you're basically doing it wrong until you do it right and you do it wrong.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I mean, the funny thing is, yeah, I know that, I know that, like, I have my older brother's voice in my head when we're taking two hours to get started because we have so much to talk about.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:19.000
And it's like, wait, when are you guys going to ever do anything for a living except sitting there fucking jerking each other off?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And then, but then I also, the same voice in my head as soon as we get started for the next four hours is like 20 minutes into it.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I know every ghost in my head that I feel all of them snap.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:42.000
And they go like, this is ridiculous. Why are you thinking about this for so long? Just have fun. It's just a good show.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:50.000
He has a booger ray. Every lesson you've ever learned is about having fun. Why aren't you ruining it? Stop ruining it.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
You're ruining it. Stop. You're overthinking it.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
And then you go like, I'm not going to overthink it anymore.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I'm going to go, what if you just had a booger ray? And then you're just like, okay, he's got a booger ray. Like, oh, write the scene.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
He's got a booger ray and he's got a booger ray and he just read it and everyone goes.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
And maybe sometimes you even just go all the way through therapy and you go like fucking just keep it moving.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
He's got a booger ray. Draw it. Draw it. Draw the booger ray.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And then they like draw it and the musician goes like, booger ray theme. Here comes the booger ray.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000
And then the editor like pieces it together and everyone's got bloodshot eyes in there.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I was like, here it is. And they press play and it's like, hey, Rick, Morty, whoever you are, I got a booger ray.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000
I'm going to pull it out. Here's the booger ray. Zap, zap, zap.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Oh geez, Rick, you really shot good with that booger ray. Yeah, I did Morty. Didn't I?

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I really did. I really shot good with that booger ray.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:50.000
But I always do it 100%. 100% with that booger ray. 100% booger ray. 100years.com booger ray.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Oh, that's great. Yeah, that's great, Morty. That's great. That's great.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Three minutes later and then they press pause and now you got two EPs at the top going like,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:13.000
seems to lack a little something. Yeah, but they don't want to call it the part where we agonize in the writer's room

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:22.000
because that makes everyone mad too. Let's figure out how to fix it. I haven't figured it out.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Well, I think because I'm working on a 11 minute show, we can do the book booger ray episode.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And it's not the 22 minute where... Man, he's stealing your idea.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Yeah, season two, episode one is the booger ray episode. We stole it and it's coming out.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Well, let's punish Justin because we got Goldenfold's voice here. I'll do Rick and Morty.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:07.000
You can be the voice of Celestra, the ice queen. And Waysaw, you do Rubik, the amazing cube.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000
And we'll improvise an episode of Rick and Morty. Okay.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Okay, here we go. Oh shit, we lost our Goldenfold. Hold on. Let's get him lubricated.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Just like at work.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Yeah, is there as much drinking going on in the writer's room?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Not at Hot Streets.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I don't drink at work.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Before two.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Sorry, before we start, was Rubik kind of like the...

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
He was an amazing cube.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Did he sound like Howie Mandel from Grimlins?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
He kind of did, yeah, but you don't have to do that.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
He's more of an Emmanuel Lewis kind of a character.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Oh, a connoisseur.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.000
I mean, I was just riffing something.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Okay, fade in, interior Rick's garage day.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Gotta put this transistor inside this compactor.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Hey, Rick, do you think you could give me a new prom suit for the prom tonight?

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Morty would rather eat glass than ever indulge in your adolescent fucking rituals.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
You piece of shit, everything you believe is a lie.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Okay, well, as mom said...

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Your mom says a lot of things, Morty.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000
She said, yes, when your father said, would you like this in you?

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000
I think that says enough about her.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:50.000
If I ever dabbled in time travel, believe me, a lot of problems would be solved.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
We wouldn't be having this conversation.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Rick, are you extra drunk?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Yes.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.000
All I wanted was an extra prom suit.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
All right, Morty, look, fine, here.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:10.000
This serum, if you pour it on yourself, it'll turn your clothes into whatever your mind thinks is important.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
That's the B story.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:21.000
It's low stakes, hopefully it'll generate a lot of bits with, I'm saying, summer.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:31.000
She's on the payroll, got to use her. Go talk to your sister about clothes while I deal with what I'm working on on this bench.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Goldenfold enters the open garage.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Let's go.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
I smell poop.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Goldenfold, can you use your finger for a second?

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000
I need an extra hand.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I was just extra mean to Morty and I needed some assistance.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Yeah, sure, but you're not going to pull my finger, are you?

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
No, no, no, no.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
I have a flatulence problem.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I'm way more sophisticated than that. Just put your finger here and hold down that button and no matter what you do,

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:11.000
don't wish that wishing was impossible.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.000
I was just wishing that wishing wasn't impossible.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
What have you done? You created a new story.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Welcome to my domain.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
What the fuck? Shit, my portal gun. I left it on the toilet again.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000
There's no need for portals.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Or guns here, my domain. Please have a seat.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Shit.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Two chairs out of nowhere. How did I do that?

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Please tell me that you want to probe me.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I want to probe you. Is that how you say hello?

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Meanwhile at the Smith House in the B story.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Hey, Summer, Rick told me to occupy you in a scene that has to do with me pouring a serum on my clothes.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Hi, I'm Rubix.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:22.000
When you poured that serum on you, it created me.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000
And I am here to stay. And Rick and Morty.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Oh, geez. Rick must have given me a serum. He must have mixed them up.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000
And now I got a Rubik.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.000
If you put me to shape correctly, Al, grant you a wish.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Well, that's no problem at all. I can do that for sure.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I watch PewDiePie do this all the time, I think.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.000
My generation. I watch videos about people reacting to videos about Rubik's cubes.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.000
So here we go. I did it. I made you the same color on all sides.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I grant you one wish.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Whoa.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Jessica.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Back to Narnia Planet.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000
That's when I found out I was adopted.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Thank you for sharing that. That was a wonderful story.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
That was really great. Here, have some more ice muffins.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Oh, delicious.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Hey, Ice Queen, how come my body is turning into ice?

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
That's because you're sweating too much.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Are you hiding something? Is he hiding something?

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:47.000
I think you're hiding something. Why don't you have a seat before you completely freeze

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000
and kind of just let something off of your chest, just like your friend did here.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Just let something off of your chest. Let it off.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
We really got to get out of here.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:04.000
There's something about this Narnia mushroom that's making it easy to release my thoughts.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Oh, my father.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.000
You just said something about your father. Let's probe that.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
My father took me on a fishing trip.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.000
He threw me out of a boat.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
I didn't know how to swim.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I was sucked down into the muck.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I had a regular eyebrow.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And regular hair.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:45.000
And then a caterpillar climbed onto my forehead at the bottom of the lake.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Gave me my trademark unibrow.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000
And then my hair became spiky as I moved up through the water,

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
which was next to an alcohol plant.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000
And so I became an alcoholic. That's why I drink.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000
And my clothes, the color was bleached out of them by the alcohol and the water.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:15.000
So I came out of the lake looking like all of the qualities that my character has.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:21.000
That's fascinating. We'll be right back.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Ben gay foot cream makes your foot less...herty.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Hey, my name's Ben. Let me cream on your foot.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Oh, fuck.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Reach for the solution that counts. Reach for Ben gay.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Oh, that pony.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.000
This Sunday at the Toronto Truck Show, all trucks all the time in Toronto.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
There's the Daisy Plus 40-foot yacht.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Come meet David Hasselhoff and the cast of...

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:54.000
You at the park.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Do you have doing my own taxes, Idis?

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
My name is Tax Johnson. I'll do all your taxes.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Call me. I'm Spanish. A brigado.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
We now return to Rick and Morty.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Oh, shit. Fuck.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Oh, Ice Queen. This is so good.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Goddamn.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Fuckin' me in the butt with that icicle strap on.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Meanwhile, in the B story...

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Oh, geez. Summer. Oh, God.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000
All right. All right. Let's put a little wrap that up there.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
We're just trying to punish Justin for not coming.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
He thinks having too much edible is bad.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Yeah.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Is this Canon?

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Yeah. I have at least 50% right to say.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
That's it. Now we know how Rick got his eyebrows.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Actually, there's one thing I wanted to talk to you about.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Oh, shit. Real behind the secret.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Here we go.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Do you think, like, because I've been getting into, like, anime lately?

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
And, like...

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
I know. I know.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
And then, and giggled, and giggled at the same time.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Anime.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
But, like, what do you think about, like,

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
giving too much information about a character?

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Like, because, like, I've been...

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I've been re...

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Tired?

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I've been tired.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
But what do you think about this?

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000
I think it's a terrible idea. I'm not being glib.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Because I think that our friends don't have origin stories.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000
We learn things about them that make sense when we look at them as a whole.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
But we don't learn the...

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:05.000
As much as we enjoyed the River Phoenix opening to Indiana Jones, the third movie,

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000
it also simultaneously, we were watching Indiana Jones die.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Like, we were getting too much information.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
That's how I feel about that stuff.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
When I was watching season three, episode one,

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000
what I was feeling is that,

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:29.000
because there had been so much talk about

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
what had happened to Beth's mom,

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
that it had become a bigger mystery than it may be,

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
because it ended on a cliffhanger,

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.000
to me, like, when episode three, or season three came out, episode one,

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000
and you're like, it's all about Szechuan sauce, which I thought was hilarious.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000
But, like, was that to diffuse that whole, like...

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Because, like, people are wanting...

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Yeah, you have to undercut any efforts made in that area.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
I think you provide both. You give people the option.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I think there's, like, 35 different categories of TV viewer.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000
There are people who relentlessly catalog,

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
there are people who hate what they love,

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
there are people who ship, there are people who hate shippers,

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
there are...

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:26.000
But all of them represent, like, some small part of what you experience

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000
when you watch a TV show, and I think that the responsible thing

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000
in terms of craft, person, ship, you're welcome, ladies,

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.000
of mid-word, mid-word, inclusive, 90-degree fucking move,

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000
didn't even, and didn't stop the show and point it out either.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Okay, okay, don't break your arm.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Happy February.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Don't break your arm, Pat, yourself on the back.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Fucking woke.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Woke, AF, hashtag!

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Um...

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Oh, my God.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000
I love that your hashtag is backwards.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000
I put the hashtag on the end.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Motherfuckers gonna die, hashtag!

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Wait.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Wait a minute.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Um, what the fuck was I babbling about?

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I don't know.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Oh, God.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
We're in the black house base.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
We're giving too much backstory to a character

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000
why you should not.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
It's not about willful denial of it either.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000
I don't...

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.000
It's just, it's about respecting everyone's right.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Right is a strong word because I hate everyone

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
and they don't have rights to material, but...

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Well, you've said this before.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
And maybe I've read this other place,

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
another book I've read about writing.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
It's like start the story as far into the story as you can.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
And let it be Doctor Who, which Doctor Who evolved naturally,

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
but they accidentally found what I think is the way

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
to survive post-Golden Age TV with a franchise,

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
a modular franchise.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Now, look, Serial TV is great.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
I love Russian doll.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000
I love it all.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I love the Groundhog Days of Genre now.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000
It's fine.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Like, I will...

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I'm not gonna end up being...

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000
I'm too old.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
It's too late for me.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Like, modularity is like that feeling of,

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
like, that's my family.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I can come home to them anytime I want.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
They're always there.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Aunt Jackie's always a fucking drunk.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Maybe there could be an episode where she's not a drunk.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
If that fucks up your show,

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
it's because you didn't design Aunt Jackie's character right.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Like, because nobody's character is that they're drunk,

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000
he said.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Ha ha!

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Whatever.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
But, like, I mean, yeah, I mean,

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
you triggered a thing that could make me talk for three hours.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Oh, I actually want to talk.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
What do you think, because I think,

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000
like, one of the greatest black holes of drama right now

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
is the mystery box theory of storytelling,

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
where you keep teasing the audience,

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000
and then you, at the end, it's just a bigger mystery.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
It's kind of like...

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Lost.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
It's lost.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Yeah, but we'll see where that goes.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
I think that's like painting yourself in a corner.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
There's a tweaked version of mystery box,

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
which is mystery buffet,

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
where you keep opening it up more and more.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
You keep giving people more and more options.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
You don't, you never deny anything.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
The first rule is that if it's canon, it's canon.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
You can't, you don't move back on it.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000
You never say, well, you perceived that wrong.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
We didn't, you know, you just keep adding more things.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
You're hosting a party.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.000
You go, like, hey, who wants to get high?

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000
They just invented ketamine, so I have it now.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
You always stay on top of everything,

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
and just, like, there's a room in every house

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
for every type of person.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000
There's a room in your party for people who hate parties.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
That's when you're, like, that's if you're a good host.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
There's just plants and a dog in here, man.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Just relax.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I hate everyone else, too.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
That's cool.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Like, and, yeah, I said, like, they said,

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:59.000
that's, no, no, like, this is going to pay off one day.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Like, I would hate to make that promise.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
You know, oh, hang on, everybody.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Ooh, there's the one our man again.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
It's going to hang on.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
That's why you should enjoy the show.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
You don't, you don't want to cross that threshold of,

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.000
like, this is why it seems like it's a little disingenuous.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000
It's its own trick, which is to trick people.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
I think when people sit down and they want to hear a story,

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000
they want to hear a story, and they want you to go from A to B.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000
If you go boo-hoo butt.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000
I feel like that's, like, the equivalent of throwing sand in a fight.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Yeah.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Like, I feel like when, when, when broadcast television

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
started competing with cable television,

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
that's when serialization and cliffhangers started happening.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
That's when event television started happening,

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000
and there's good, good stories that emerge from it,

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
and there, but overall, it's like,

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Like what?

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000
How can I compete with American Idol if I'm just Knight Rider?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Well, the answer is Knight Rider has to go,

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:59.000
I just committed incest with, to be continued.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
It's like, like, you have to tune in.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
You have to, you have to.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
We're not even going to finish making television until you tune in,

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
which I think is, like, not...

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000
But I think, I think, like, like Breaking Bad did it, like, really well.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Like, that's, like, that, to me, was, like, binge TV before Netflix made it.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Yeah.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
I hated the ending.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Well, you...

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Well, I mean...

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
I would, I would say, like, shows...

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Yeah, I guess...

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
I like shows that in the finale of that season,

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
they kind of tie up the mysteries.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Like, the wire, like, when you get to the end,

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
it's like, that's the season.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Right.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Like, you, you feel nourished.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Like, that's the story, and it goes down and feels good.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I like that, like, both Law and Order and X-Files

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000
where they intersect is that both shows

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.000
delineated between mythology energy and modular energy.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
So Law and Order was the extreme of it,

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
because it's like, they don't want to lose a single viewer

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
to the idea that you have to know who these people are.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000
So they just let you get addicted to Jerry Oribach.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Like, of course you should.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000
He's a...

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
What is a character?

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000
He's a raincoat.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
He's an eyebrow.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000
He...

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Give the actor some credit, you know?

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Yeah.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Like, that's what they're gonna fall in love with.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
So just let him, like, rate your stories.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000
You're a writer.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Like, give these people something to do

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
so that if you watch one episode,

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
it's like smoking a crack rock,

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
which is, yes, connected to all other crack rocks,

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
but not necessary to smoke that crack rock

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
before that crack rock.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
That's the difference.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
It's like, crack is the goal.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
So...

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And I love, like, I always want, like,

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.000
I watch Law and Order and Syndication on TBS,

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.000
and I was like...

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000
I was like, I got so fucking hooked after, like, five of them,

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
and I'm just like, God damn, I love Jerry Oribach.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
God damn, I love this and that.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000
And, like, never anything, no plot, nothing,

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
except for the one self-contained plot

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
of the homicide that happened and the solving of it.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000
And then at the end of the season,

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.000
the lieutenant, like, Jerry Oribach's, like,

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:07.000
well, I guess that crowbar murderer found out

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.000
not to pry, and I made it up.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
What, you made that up?

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
And it's like...

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
And then the lieutenant, like, stops him

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
as he's about to leave the doorway,

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
and he goes, like, hey, and he turns around,

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000
and she goes, how's the drinking going?

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.000
And he goes, yeah, one day at a time.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000
And then he walks out, Dick Wolf.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
That was an entire season.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
That was all you learned about Jerry Oribach,

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000
unless you, like, but then it, like, makes you go,

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
you gobble it up, sorry, I'm babbling, whatever.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
No, no, no, it's a good point.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
But X-Files did this, a similar thing

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000
with the Smoking Man stuff, where it was, like,

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
if they had been able to hold that line,

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
which I'm not, like, just that idea of, like,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
you know, every time, it's like, all we wanted was,

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
give me more about Smoking Man and what happened

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
to Fox's sister and all this stuff,

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
and it was like, how could they ever resist,

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
like, giving us more and more of that,

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
but every time they gave you more of that,

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
you're, like, you're losing something.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
It's, like, ballast or something,

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000
and it's, like, you want to, like, keep that shit up there.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Is that how you play event-centered

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
versus character-driven against each other

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000
in the course of a season?

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
I think I could just say yes to that question,

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
but I don't, I'm not sure I understand that.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Well, it's like Twin Peaks, the minute,

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
the minute they said, okay, this is what happened

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
with Laura Palmer, the show was over with,

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
but they went on another season.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Like, you want to keep, you want to keep,

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000
the stuff that's, it's not the destination,

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
it's the journey, you know, with any of these shows.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I mean, Nick, I can't keep for the life of me.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
You want to entertain that fantasy

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
that you can do something else,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000
but that's why I was obsessive.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
That was my big rift with Sony.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
For the three years it took to fire me on Community,

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000
was that I was like, yes, this is a great show.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Yes, my goal is to make it fucking amazing

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
in a way that would make you want to watch

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
a thousand episodes of it.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
But in order to do that, we have to acknowledge

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
that we made a deal with a certain chronological devil.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
We said that Annie Edison is a child

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
and that she's growing up.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
We said that Jeff Winger is paying

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
a four years price for who he was.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
We're telling a story here.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Like, we have to get out in front of this thing

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000
so far, so fast that no one notices

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000
that we stopped having to go to Community College

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000
because at some point we're going to have to.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
And like, Sony would get so mad.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
They'd be like, what are you talking about?

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Watch fucking Welcome Back Cotter

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
and shut the fuck up.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Watch MASH, you dumb asshole.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.000
The show was 11 years longer than the war

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
and everyone's rich.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Why are you burning our money?

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Stop making television for Reddit.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000
And I was like, it's not going to work, man.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
We're not going to be able to say it's Halloween

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
for the 90th time in a row.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000
And Allison Breeze was like, oh,

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.000
it was a forbidden fruit again.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
It's a four year story, but yeah.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Anyway, I'm sorry, let's get out of here.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.000
You triggered fucking your Vietnam vet dad.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I pretended to be dead.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
They wanted a tripod on me.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
All this because somebody dropped a plate.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Calm down, dad.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Weissal.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Hot streets.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Every mystery that is introduced

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.000
will get revealed by the end of the season.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
You will not be tricked.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
The history of television, someone will know that

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000
NBC peaked at this point where it was like,

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000
they had literally had a show called The Event.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
It was like right before 80% of you were like

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
even invested in anything because it was like

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
you were born on Netflix and so you're kind of like,

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
but there was this point where it was like

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
the squeezing of the sponge before everyone was like,

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
fuck it, who's on Shark Tank?

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000
They were like greenlighting these crazy series

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000
because it was like the idea of event television.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000
And NBC, God bless their sincere, dopey heart.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
It was just like, well, then literally,

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000
let's just make a show called The Event.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000
And there's like, if you go to the commercial

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
because they had this like whole teaser campaign with it,

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.000
the teaser campaign was them explaining to you

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000
what the show wasn't because it was about payoffs

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.000
and they would go, the president getting assassinated

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:42.000
is not the event.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
And then it shows a guy going,

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
why am I leaving the White House?

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
I'll tell you on the way.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:54.000
The concert exploding is not the event.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
You were supposed to tune into the show

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000
to find out what the event was.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Television reduced to breakfast cereal.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
What was the event?

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.000
The event was its fucking cancellation after six episodes.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000
The event was a lot of guys that work a lot less

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000
harder than I do, getting a lot more money.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
I don't want to be bitter.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.000
They smacked this kid at a backyard barbecue.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
The slap!

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Yeah, and it's told.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000
The slap is the event.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000
It's told from everybody's point of view.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:34.000
You will find out whether or not Betty is ugly.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Yeah.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000
What am I doing?

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Like, my job is to know what to say next.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Everyone knows I don't.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000
February 24th at midnight.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Hot street season two.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Who are you having on this season?

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Any major super celebrities?

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
This is Hollywood.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.000
We've got Ernie Hudson during the cast.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
I like the black one.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.000
You know, when you watch season one, it's always sunny.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000
I remember watching a thing.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000
This show is really funny.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
And then Danny DeVito jends the cast.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
And they're like, holy shit, the show,

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
it's weird to watch the first season.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
That's how I feel with Ernie Hudson.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Why, so I heard this story.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Maybe you can confirm this and share an animation buff

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
and your friends with Ernest Hudson.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:24.000
I heard during that when they did the real Ghostbusters

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.000
animated series that Ernie Hudson auditioned for Winston

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
but lost it to Arsenial Hall.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Is this true?

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
That is true, but I mean, I'm speaking for him,

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000
but I've read interviews with him where he auditioned for the part.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000
But when we cast him, his voice is so powerful

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
that I think what happened was like,

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000
you had all these voice actors that were really

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000
founding and talented.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000
But Winston would be the lead character

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000
because his voice is so fucking powerful

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
that you can't ignore it.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:03.000
So I feel like in the movies, Winston was kind of...

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Something weird happened.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Yeah, it's kind of weird.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Like, he's not really in the movie.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
It was like he was over-empowered maybe by virtue

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
of a latent racism.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I'm not trying to high-road anybody.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
It was the 80s.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
But I remember being a 10-year-old kid,

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
a 12-year-old kid watching Ghostbusters.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000
He had a flannel shirt on.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000
He smoked cigarettes.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
And his first line is like,

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
look, as long as there's a steady paycheck involved,

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I'll believe anything you say.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
And he was very...

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Did that skirt the line?

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Did we get shut down?

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000
The month of February has shut you down.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:41.000
But he had that kind of like,

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
albeit maybe equally problematic,

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000
but from a completely different direction,

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
where he was the empowered...

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000
He was powerful.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000
And then Ghostbusters 2,

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.000
in addition to all the other weird things about it.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Also, because I just...

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
He just did an interview recently

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
where he was talking about Ghostbusters 2.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000
I didn't realize this.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
But in Ghostbusters 2,

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
they do this thing where they catch up

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
with all the characters,

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
but they don't catch up with Winston.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
He just comes back in the middle of the movie.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Everybody has their own business.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000
And then Winston just comes back.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.000
That's documentary-worthy.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Anybody watch that Lorena Bobbitt documentary?

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
No, I do remember it, though.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Stick with it.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
I started to get a stick of it.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
That's the name of the documentary?

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Stick with it.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Stick with it.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Stick it back on.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
I swear, like, like, if you're,

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
you get to a point where you're, like,

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000
this is the 90th time they've explained to us

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
that these people have backstories

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.000
that I don't care.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
But toward the end of that thing,

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
it gets so deep and intense.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
It's really weird.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
For me, especially...

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Your dick was cut off.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I just want to remember

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000
working in a blue-collar city

01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.000
and doing improv,

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
like, we're familiar with the Bobbits

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.960
is a word that everyone would shout out as a suggestion

01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:06.760
for comedy shows that we wished that they would,

01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:10.960
not because we were feminists, because we're snobs,

01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:12.360
we're like, shut the fuck up,

01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:14.400
we're not doing another goddamn sketch

01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:16.320
where I mime a dick getting cut off.

01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:18.320
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:22.320
So that's all I ever knew about the bobbitt thing.

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:26.680
And it's very interesting, like there's a documentary series

01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:31.680
like they unpack it for like 10 hours of, it's worth it.

01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:34.360
But by the end of it, I'm telling you,

01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:37.880
you'll have like synapses that are like reformed.

01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:38.840
What is the takeaway?

01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:40.320
What's the craziest thing that you learned

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:41.720
that you didn't know back then?

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:47.560
How, our facility to ignore abuse, I mean,

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:51.240
I really don't, it both, like as a culture,

01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:54.360
like the way that we can like focus on the things

01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:56.840
that are like, fuck it,

01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:58.640
now the women are shutting us down.

01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:02.120
The patriarchy I think is now,

01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:05.920
it's just like, oh, she cut his dick off,

01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:06.960
so that's interesting.

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:10.000
You got our attention, you cut a dick off,

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.000
so you have our attention.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.120
Excuse me, what, she cut her dick off, okay, uh, uh, hand.

01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:15.840
And then it's like, and then it's like this sort of,

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:20.680
like this like, you really come away with a complete feeling

01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:22.080
of like, look.

01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:26.240
There's a lot more to it than just the dick getting cut off.

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:29.200
The unfortunate people who was long since before that

01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:32.680
were like, does anyone want to talk about equal rights

01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:36.240
and the spousal abuse problem and all this things?

01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:39.120
And then this weird portal happens where it's like,

01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:40.560
a woman cut a guy's dick off,

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:44.480
everyone wants to talk about penises and abuse

01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:46.560
and battery and rape.

01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:51.440
And then these well-minded people who are like, okay, great.

01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:54.080
So now let's talk about this and like the kind of tragedy

01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:57.760
of like, well, no, I mean, we want to talk about dicks

01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:00.760
and cutting off and like, we want to,

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:03.400
we like tablet celebrities, we don't,

01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:05.000
but it's not a downer.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.080
I think it's a-

01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:07.360
It is the beginning though, right?

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:09.200
Of sort of like that celebrity.

01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:12.200
Well, it's time, it starts, it starts a conversation,

01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:13.800
you know, it's like, before that,

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.760
you literally couldn't say the word penis in media.

01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:18.720
You couldn't say the word penis in New York times,

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:19.560
like things like that.

01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:23.760
Like, so it starts a thing, it's worth watching.

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:26.080
Anyways, I don't know how to end the show,

01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:29.120
so I thought I'd like recommend a Netflix thing.

01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:31.040
Waisal, what do you recommend?

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:33.080
Better be fucking not self-indulgent,

01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:34.520
better be high-minded.

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:37.120
I'm going to recommend JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:40.000
the anime that I'm currently infatuated with.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.840
It's really funny and cool and it's crazy.

01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:44.080
I remember you recommended to me,

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:46.120
what was that Titan fucking like,

01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:47.880
giants are fighting Titans?

01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:50.320
Yeah, I recommended the first season of Attack on Titan,

01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:53.240
but Dan watched it without the subtitles.

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:56.040
You know what I mean?

01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:57.880
It's not the same show.

01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:01.000
But the second season, you know,

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.400
they kind of blew it a little bit.

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:05.200
I just want, first season's amazing, first season's great.

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:07.200
Your pitch was too good.

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:09.440
You were like, there's for some unknown reason,

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:11.680
there's naked giants attacking the world.

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:14.960
I was like, I wanted that show.

01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:16.280
Yeah, you don't know how to trust a dude

01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:18.880
who is looking for like unicorn fart videos.

01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:25.240
All right, well, it's about that time.

01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:27.720
It's time for everybody to start dreading Tuesday.

01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:30.640
And so we end with our traditional song.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.680
["Joy of the House"]
