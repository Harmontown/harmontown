00:00.000 --> 00:23.480
Here you hear you, Harmontown is now in session.

00:23.480 --> 00:27.960
Welcome to the Nerdmelt Theater in Hollywood, California, and you listening out in podcast

00:27.960 --> 00:32.160
land. Thank you for joining us. Please won't you all either physically or spiritually put

00:32.160 --> 00:48.200
your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon. Thank you. Thank you.

00:48.200 --> 00:57.840
Are you going to be troubled tonight, pink hair? All right, pink hair in line. I parked here earlier

00:57.840 --> 01:05.880
to go meet some friends. Well, yeah, because you screamed at me and I was terrified. I blew you

01:05.880 --> 01:12.960
a kiss because I was afraid for my own safety. Well, what's your name for fuck's sake? Christina.

01:12.960 --> 01:19.680
Christina, everybody. Security, keep an eye on Christina. You may regret that applause in a

01:19.680 --> 01:29.400
moment. Cynthia, Christina. Pink hair. Pink hair is the only primary crime. She's very excited to

01:29.400 --> 01:35.160
be here tonight. Very excited, very excited to be near either of us. Very excited to be here with

01:35.160 --> 01:40.520
all of you. Unfortunately, her secondary crime is her excitement is causing her to be a real

01:40.520 --> 01:48.200
hooligan. Now I made you sad. Okay, well, it's good. I need to be able to make you sad. That's

01:48.200 --> 01:55.920
the threat of a hooligan. Okay, good. That's the only difference between... Christina, have you

01:55.920 --> 02:03.040
been here to Harmontown before? You're from Las Vegas, so this is a big deal. Being in the

02:03.040 --> 02:11.840
back room at a comic book store. Yeah, it's like being in Paris or Rome. You come from a city where

02:11.840 --> 02:22.160
the Adams family has their own slot machine. Why do you care that you're here? Do you have

02:22.160 --> 02:29.560
any expectations or hopes or dreams tonight? Nothing? What would be your dream if you could

02:29.560 --> 02:35.080
wake up tomorrow morning? And why am I in such a good mood? Oh, because that happened. What would

02:35.080 --> 02:43.120
be the thing that you would hope to come out of the show tonight? Okay, all right. Don't put me

02:43.120 --> 02:53.400
on the spot, asshole, she just said. The gauntlet has been thrown. We're coming back to you,

02:53.400 --> 03:05.760
Christina. Mars. So curiosity has landed. And they're not going digging, by the way. The thing

03:05.760 --> 03:10.320
in the front is not a big scooper on the Curiosity rover on Mars. They got a laser on it that's

03:10.320 --> 03:15.600
going to evaporate rocks from a distance, and they're going to analyze rocks with a laser. Oh,

03:15.600 --> 03:20.440
you know who's just telling me about that? Six-year-old Gil, whose podcast they did upstairs. The

03:20.440 --> 03:25.840
owner of the place has a six-year-old son who has a podcast. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. How many

03:25.840 --> 03:32.200
podcasts do you have, man? No, it's his podcast, Gil. Are you cheating on me? No, no. I was on

03:32.200 --> 03:38.160
another person's podcast. I do that. The theme tonight is infidelity, by the way. Ah, very nice,

03:38.160 --> 03:43.840
Jeff. Yes. When will you learn that I will control the shit out of this motherfucker? Thank you,

03:43.840 --> 03:48.000
Jeff. I misinterpreted it. I thought it was a non-sequitur. I thought you were misunderstanding,

03:48.000 --> 03:52.200
but actually what happened there is Jeff was segueing into our theme for tonight, which I

03:52.200 --> 03:58.280
allowed the audience in line to choose. I gave them a choice between travel, finance, and infidelity.

03:58.280 --> 04:06.320
And, you know, predictably enough, I should have thrown boobs in there, which was on the

04:06.320 --> 04:10.600
master list because then we'd be talking about boobs all night. But I figure we'll be talking

04:10.600 --> 04:15.280
about boobs regardless. If the theme was travel, we're going to end up talking about my hemorrhoids.

04:15.280 --> 04:21.720
Our last show, I've got to say, if we can read the minutes from the last show. I listened to a

04:21.720 --> 04:30.400
recording of it. It was based solely around the butthole, I believe. It was at a certain point,

04:30.400 --> 04:35.600
we just started talking about things in butts. And I talked about how I once put a sharpie

04:35.600 --> 04:43.520
pen in my butt. I talked about how I had a real doll at one point. Jeff talked about how he put

04:43.520 --> 04:54.920
on fishnets once. See, he can't fail. I fuck a mannequin and I'm a pariah. Jeff's a transvestite

04:54.920 --> 05:01.040
and all the women are throwing their panties up for him to put on. I'm a sweet transvestite.

05:01.040 --> 05:09.360
That's my secret. Rob Schrab came up and told us about scalding his own butt with hot water.

05:09.360 --> 05:16.440
It just turned into a theme. I was thinking that infidelity would be, I would rather do

05:16.440 --> 05:26.640
travel or finance, but then pink hair started freaking out. Anyways, there's a whole thing

05:26.640 --> 05:33.360
in line. The crowd, the hooligans chose infidelity as a theme. We got questions from you. Jeff will

05:33.360 --> 05:39.360
control those. I haven't read them. We'll pop over to them. Why don't we give them a taste? You

05:39.360 --> 05:44.080
want to crack one off right off the bat? Sure, why not? All right. Just from the top of the pile

05:44.080 --> 05:51.240
here out of my right suit pocket. If Troy ever cheated on Abed, who would it be with? Community

05:51.240 --> 06:07.920
question. Obviously it would be Britta. Do I have to think of a funny answer? No. Troy's in

06:07.920 --> 06:15.600
love with Britta. We're talking to a guy whose show broke up with him and started fucking another

06:15.600 --> 06:23.280
showrunner. Who do you think Troy's in love with? Do you guys watch the show? That wasn't a

06:23.280 --> 06:32.400
secret. I'm not Damon Lindelof. You don't have to watch the episodes backwards and freeze frame

06:32.400 --> 06:44.080
on the shot of his driver's license and run it through the Da Vinci matrix. He just seemed to

06:44.080 --> 06:50.160
have a big crush on Britta, it seemed. Anyways, let's not talk about that. Let's get over that

06:50.160 --> 07:00.840
relationship, shall we? That was an example of a question about infidelity. How deep do you want

07:00.840 --> 07:04.960
to dig on the first one? Do you want to start off light or heavy stuff? We're not talking to you,

07:04.960 --> 07:12.200
pink hair. Holy shit. You can't go back and forth between being rambunctious and then going, I'm

07:12.200 --> 07:18.080
sorry, don't pick on me. We're going to start picking on you. You've got to keep it down to

07:18.080 --> 07:28.640
feel the people around you. You're sitting right next to Enti. He's like a star here. He doesn't

07:28.640 --> 07:32.880
have the right to get all. He would be playing into a stereotype if he started yelling.

07:32.880 --> 07:41.480
For podcast people, he's talking about a black gentleman. You might remember him from one of

07:41.480 --> 07:50.400
our numerous podcasts about race. Episodes three through eight, which the theme ended up being

07:50.400 --> 07:55.760
race. You weren't here last time, were you? We thought we had really committed a crime. We had

07:55.760 --> 08:03.280
done something terrible. Enti's like the last Native American. If he goes away, we littered too

08:03.280 --> 08:12.880
much. We're comforted by his presence. We're hanging onto that bow. What blows my mind is

08:12.880 --> 08:18.360
that you continue. You seem like a very nice kind of mild mannered dude. You still sit right in

08:18.360 --> 08:25.000
the front row every time. It's like a splash zone. He's an aspiring writer, right, Enti? You

08:25.000 --> 08:31.280
want to be a writer? I don't know if that maybe that's offensive. Maybe you are a writer. I think

08:31.280 --> 08:36.560
you want to be a writer. Okay. I don't know. Maybe he wrote a fucking thing for his school

08:36.560 --> 08:45.480
paper. He's going to go home and cut himself. He didn't acknowledge my poetry series. Enti

08:45.480 --> 08:58.040
heart full soul. I have a question for Pink Hair Lady real quick. Do you live in the 714 area

08:58.040 --> 09:05.760
here? Someone wrote down call me and there's a phone number. There's Pink Lipstick all over it.

09:05.760 --> 09:19.160
Someone shat their hand up. Who was it? All right. That's not your boyfriend that you came

09:19.160 --> 09:26.960
here with, right? You're not doing this to him. Okay. All right. Well, tonight is weird. Should

09:26.960 --> 09:35.840
we just go get Jeffrey Ross, bring him up here? It feels like a toxic, ugly night is why I asked

09:35.840 --> 09:44.480
that question. No, it's going to be fine. Haremontown should be a safe place. The original

09:44.480 --> 09:51.080
conceit is I need to start a colony somewhere where we can all be cool to one another. I have

09:51.080 --> 09:55.960
some issues that I would bring to bear immediately. You can have your shoes untied and no one can

09:55.960 --> 10:01.360
say your shoes are untied unless they really mean it well instead of just saying your shoes are

10:01.360 --> 10:05.000
untied just to assert themselves over you, which is what I'm convinced people do when they say

10:05.000 --> 10:09.360
your shoes are untied. But I've said to you and I've heard people say to you that your shoes were

10:09.360 --> 10:15.720
untied in the nicest possible tone and you still took great umbrage. They still mean it. Can I

10:15.720 --> 10:23.120
tell you a story about me taking umbrage that happened outside? Time for a Dan's umbrage corner.

10:23.120 --> 10:36.880
My wonderful girlfriend Erin McGathy and I went to a party, a rooftop party, that every year I

10:36.880 --> 10:42.920
think Sarah Silverman has this rooftop party. And the stars come out in all their constellations.

10:42.920 --> 10:53.720
I met Chris Bosh and then I googled him and figured out who he was. I met Das Racist and I

10:53.720 --> 10:59.440
googled them and figured out who they were. I met Jack Black and he was like hey Das Racist is

10:59.440 --> 11:08.000
here. I met Garry Shandling and talked to him for like eight minutes about television. He did

11:08.000 --> 11:12.640
all the talking which was fine. I never even told him that I had anything to do with TV. I wanted

11:12.640 --> 11:19.160
to hear Garry Shandling talk about TV. For you youngsters, I know you know Larry Sanders, the same

11:19.160 --> 11:25.280
way you know Mr. Show because you're the way I had to know Python. But do you know it's Gary

11:25.280 --> 11:30.520
Shandling's show on Showtime? That's important to go buy the box set of. Maybe you don't have to

11:30.520 --> 11:35.800
sit through all of it. It's 1980s comedy. But the conceit of the concept was amazing, like Gary

11:35.800 --> 11:43.160
Shandling was, has always been a pioneer of what, for lack of a better word, and I truly wish there

11:43.160 --> 11:50.560
was no lack of a better word, meta entertainment. He's always been a defender of the creative's

11:50.560 --> 11:59.480
right to use the frame as part of the painting. And so he talked for a little bit about the thing.

11:59.480 --> 12:08.600
But so as we were going into that party, we pulled up to the building, and we were walking in,

12:08.600 --> 12:14.480
and a guy said, are you here for Ms. Silverman's party? And we said yes. And he said, it's on the

12:14.480 --> 12:19.880
roof. Go on the elevators on the left and straight up. I don't know what accent that is, but I know

12:19.880 --> 12:27.640
he had one. It was Turkistan. Turkistan. Then as we were opening the door, we just hear this voice.

12:27.640 --> 12:36.360
This guy goes, the party's over. And I was like, oh, what? And looked over at the guy who said it,

12:36.360 --> 12:44.200
and it was just a guy sitting on a bench. And he was sitting with a woman that was, and I was like,

12:44.200 --> 12:51.520
oh, whoa, whoa, what is it? And he immediately smiled and was like, I'm just kidding. And then we

12:51.520 --> 12:58.240
went in and went in the elevator. And now in the elevator, I went, that guy's a fucking lame ass.

12:58.240 --> 13:06.560
Or certainly his joke was lame. And Aaron was like, well, now he's just trying to be a comrade,

13:06.560 --> 13:12.560
whatever. He's as nervous as you are to be outside a party. He's trying to be funny, whatever. Good

13:12.560 --> 13:21.680
old Joan of Arc Aaron tied to the fucking stake of being cool to everybody. I hated him. I thought

13:21.680 --> 13:26.960
he was a dick. Like, that's a dumb joke to make. If your joke is that you're a dick, that's a dick's

13:26.960 --> 13:33.200
joke. And maybe you may be pretending to be a dick, but that's what a dick does. If that's always your

13:33.200 --> 13:40.320
joke, I mean, that's often my joke. But so we go to the party. Like, I'm not up here to have a

13:40.320 --> 13:48.800
breakthrough. I'm up here to be right. I'm up here to win an argument with my girlfriend, because I

13:48.800 --> 13:56.800
have lights and a microphone on me. However, so we, we, if you were, if I go a little something, we

13:56.800 --> 14:04.720
left the party. And then we go to the valet where our car is parked. And the valet takes my ticket.

14:04.720 --> 14:11.440
And he says, which car is yours? And I said, it's a silver Prius. And then as he's walking away,

14:12.480 --> 14:18.800
I, I, I go, well, that actually may be presumptuous. Call it a gray Prius.

14:25.200 --> 14:30.640
And, and Aaron, and Aaron proceeds to, she's like, see, you're as lame as that guy

14:30.640 --> 14:39.920
outside the party. And I was like, no, because my joke is that I'm lame. His joke is that we're

14:39.920 --> 14:46.720
lame. He's like taking high status. And I was taking low status. I was doing like a dumb joke.

14:46.720 --> 14:52.800
I'm just being funny and drunk. And that guy is like, he's saying that it was presumptuous is

14:52.800 --> 14:59.920
taking low status. Well, yeah, but I was being ironic. I was being Garry Shandling about how,

14:59.920 --> 15:03.760
how what I was saying, it's just was the guy on the bench, Garry Shandling. No.

15:07.280 --> 15:14.400
And then we got in a big fight. And how did that go? Well, it was her sticking up for a stranger

15:14.400 --> 15:25.360
on a bench all night. And me going, no, my silver Prius joke was awesome. It was, it was funny.

15:25.360 --> 15:35.280
I don't want to overstep gray Prius. It's funny, you know,

15:36.960 --> 15:39.120
because silver is a color, but it also denotes value.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.360
And you, you saw that landed? Well, I didn't think it landed.

15:46.880 --> 15:51.280
I didn't think it landed. You saw that undid all the wrongs of the guy on the bench had to,

15:51.280 --> 15:54.240
why don't you change your name to Aaron? Because this is the conversation we had.

15:54.240 --> 16:00.400
But as I was trying to explain to her, it's not my joke. Unlike the good party's over guy,

16:00.400 --> 16:06.080
my joke doesn't have to land. I'm not holding anyone hostage with my joke. I'm talking to

16:06.080 --> 16:12.080
the back of a valet's head. I don't care if he's deaf. It's still a funny joke to me. And,

16:12.080 --> 16:15.200
and it doesn't matter. It doesn't have to turn around and go, huh? And me go,

16:15.200 --> 16:24.720
I'm just kidding about my Prius. It becomes a call. This guy is the, that's comedic al-Qaeda to

16:24.720 --> 16:32.880
go like, party's over. What? The party's over? No, it's not. Yeah, but I, I, six-year-old humor.

16:32.880 --> 16:38.160
I've known you long enough to know that when, when your shoe's untied, you can't even say it like,

16:38.160 --> 16:43.600
hey, Dan, we're going into a kind of a dirty restaurant, the floor is dirty. You might want

16:43.600 --> 16:48.720
to tie those shoes. Like, there's no way to say that to you without you taking offense. Nobody

16:48.720 --> 16:55.040
ever says you're going into a dirty restaurant. Everyone just goes, shoe's untied, bro. But I

16:55.040 --> 17:02.800
go, hey, Dan, uh, fucking, uh, no, my shoes aren't untied. Party's over formula. No, I'm saying,

17:02.800 --> 17:08.560
if I say that, I don't think I'm trying to zin you. I think I'm saying like, uh, should that

17:08.560 --> 17:13.040
be a concern to you? Maybe you don't notice that. I've learned now to never give two shits about

17:13.040 --> 17:18.800
your shoe laces because I'm punished. I've learned to buy shoes without laces. This is a rare night

17:18.800 --> 17:26.480
for me. I'm wearing a fine pair of Adidas. Yes, Adidas. As always, Harmontown brought to you

17:26.480 --> 17:33.360
by the good people at Adidas. Why give your foot a handshake when you can give it a hug? Yes,

17:33.360 --> 17:44.480
Adidas. The A is for after, uh, glow. Have sex with your foot by slipping a warm Adidas shoe on

17:44.480 --> 17:52.000
it. Nike. Do you think that this is ever going to pay off at Nike's going to really feel the

17:52.000 --> 17:59.040
pressure? I can't, I can't stop now. What are we going to give up? Gentlemen, I've just seen a spike

17:59.040 --> 18:02.720
in sales over at Adidas and it can only be attributed to one thing. That's what we have to

18:02.720 --> 18:08.400
hope for. This aggressive guerrilla campaign over at Harmontown to strong arm us. Yeah. I say no

18:08.400 --> 18:14.640
way. I am the C, the chief financial officer. I say no. And then an old man gets in there,

18:14.640 --> 18:20.560
comes in, and we're in a wheelchair and he goes, I think we're going about this all wrong, gentlemen.

18:21.600 --> 18:29.200
Give them whatever they want. I remember when you were a guerrilla, Richard. That's different,

18:29.200 --> 18:36.880
Mr. Jenkins. I would like to think maybe four months time instead of this Harmontown poster

18:36.880 --> 18:44.080
back here, just a huge Nike swoosh back here. I'm telling you, yeah, hey, Nike, living well is

18:44.080 --> 18:50.320
the best revenge. Fucking buy me out. And the next Harmontown can be about how much I love sucking

18:50.320 --> 18:56.880
Nike's dick. I'll have no choice. You'll have me on the hook. I think the first step though is we

18:56.880 --> 19:02.480
actually have to, it has to become evident that we've made Adidas a dollar. Yeah, well, I believe

19:02.480 --> 19:08.240
that will become evident. Don't worry about that, Jeff. Don't become one of them. Just be a creative

19:08.240 --> 19:13.360
and advertise for Adidas and let's see if we can reverse this. I'm not your valet guy. You can just

19:13.360 --> 19:22.480
yell shit at. So what was the, what was the outcome of the fight? Did you guys find any closure to

19:22.480 --> 19:28.560
that? Relationship better than ever. Sealed it all up. All the holes are plugged. I don't know.

19:30.640 --> 19:35.280
We agreed that we were both drunk and having an argument about a stupid thing. That's how it ended.

19:36.400 --> 19:42.160
Do you guys ever argue about important shit? Like, you know, like the Holocaust? Like six million

19:42.160 --> 19:51.280
people. Come on, give me the remote. No, we never argue about important things. We're both narcissistic

19:51.280 --> 19:55.120
assholes. We don't care about the polar ice caps. We care about ourselves and each other.

19:56.240 --> 20:02.240
So that's what we fight about. We fight because we worry that we don't love each other as much as

20:02.240 --> 20:08.640
the other person loves us. Those are the good fights. The love fights. You know, eagles, they

20:08.640 --> 20:21.680
make love in midair and they spiral to the floor. You're moved to words? What were you saying?

20:21.680 --> 20:25.600
He got overcome. They're dying on the way down, you say?

20:31.760 --> 20:36.720
Oh, so you like it. You like it. So you're saying the same thing the guy with the microphone is

20:36.720 --> 20:49.520
saying. Just from the audience. Have you met pink hair? Don't have children. Some of us have

20:49.520 --> 20:56.720
worked to do. Yes, Adam. Now Adam's raising his hand. I got the guy in the back doing the Mars

20:56.720 --> 21:01.840
callback. This is fucking, this is chaos. I accept it. Yes, Adam.

21:01.840 --> 21:05.840
Just saying if they have sex, they'll plummet to their deaths. If they have sex, they'll plummet to

21:05.840 --> 21:14.560
their deaths. Asperger's Adam connected the dots. We have a whole cavalcade of fucking peanuts here.

21:14.560 --> 21:19.360
The only thing that happened is that sometimes people get so overcome by what you said. They're

21:19.360 --> 21:28.880
moved to agree. They're moved to cry out. Maybe sometime your story's shoe is untied and they

21:28.880 --> 21:34.800
want to call it to your attention. You take Umbridge. No. This is a tragic misunderstanding

21:34.800 --> 21:40.720
because he was saying the same thing I was, but when I hear somebody talking, he was just being

21:40.720 --> 21:45.120
supportive. Now you really made him feel like a dick. You're saying that when people see your

21:45.120 --> 21:49.920
shoes untied, they're saying I love you. They're trying to help. They're worried about your shoe.

21:49.920 --> 21:54.480
I think that's their retroactive defense. I think if someone says, shoes untied, and you go, don't

21:54.480 --> 22:03.280
tell me what to do. Get out of my life. Tend your own garden, motherfucker. Back off. Then they go,

22:05.200 --> 22:10.400
just you could trip. Yeah, that was your first impulse. You walk around wondering when I'm

22:10.400 --> 22:15.840
going to trip. Some people do, man. Some people who go, shoes untied, bro. Not that guy. But I

22:15.840 --> 22:19.280
don't say it like that. I say your fucking shoes untied. You've never told me my shoes untied.

22:19.280 --> 22:25.120
I have a liar. How about this? Two nights ago at a wedding, we're getting ready for a wedding,

22:25.120 --> 22:30.160
and Dan Harmon came down in a nice suit. You have a suit on. Looks good in it. Dan's lost some ways

22:30.160 --> 22:35.840
all fit. He looks like one of them. Thank you. Yeah. He looks great. But the motherfucker can't tie

22:35.840 --> 22:43.040
a tie very well. You came down with a sloppy Harmon knot. And I thought, and boy, if you think

22:43.040 --> 22:48.800
your shoes untied, I have more opinions about ties than shoes because the tie is right up there by

22:48.800 --> 22:55.440
your face. And I was like, can we, let's work on that tie. And you're like, for some reason,

22:55.440 --> 23:02.160
there was a giant, giant full length mirror from my fashion show for Aaron to Shade.

23:03.280 --> 23:08.560
All right. Oh yeah. Call back. So there's a giant full length mirror down there. And I say, Dan,

23:08.560 --> 23:12.080
then I would never do this because I know that you're not rewarded for telling Dan that anything

23:12.080 --> 23:17.280
is tied wrong. He has a thing about that. And so I go, we got to fix that tie. You're like,

23:17.280 --> 23:22.400
what's wrong with my tie? And I was like, it's just, I'm going to show you something. So I reach

23:22.400 --> 23:27.440
around and like, you know, grandpa before the wedding and I'm tying the tie and Aaron's taking

23:27.440 --> 23:31.840
a picture of it. And you know, that's going to be Instagrammed in a moment. And you had the saddest

23:31.840 --> 23:35.600
look on your face. The whole tag was so bummed. Because I know it's going to be Instagrammed.

23:35.600 --> 23:39.280
And it's like, I've been tied, I've been tied a tie since I was 12 years old. Would you tie it

23:39.280 --> 23:43.920
like shit? No, I've got it down to a science. I do it very quickly. But it looks like, but it

23:43.920 --> 23:50.880
looks, it looks bad. The difference between it looking bad and looking good is how much money

23:50.880 --> 23:56.640
and power I achieve. Okay, now we're, now we're getting someone. Yeah. If I, if I put a shoe on

23:56.640 --> 24:02.400
my head, and I'm president, everyone has to put a shoe on their head. Well, we're monkeys. We're

24:02.400 --> 24:14.000
not fucking giraffes. I'm just saying you look better with it. What's your prefigure giraffes? Well,

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
they have long necks. I mean, they're obviously they're willing to change for how high the leaf is.

24:18.000 --> 24:24.720
I mean, I think because they had more neck, they'd be more concerned about ties.

24:24.720 --> 24:32.880
When did I become the crazy comic relief guy in my own show? Why am I the Jamie Farrer of this mash?

24:36.480 --> 24:42.880
There was a show in the seventies. Can we get back on track, please? I try, I try to keep an

24:42.880 --> 24:48.960
orderly show going here. I sometimes we get off on tangents. It's a rare thing, but normally this

24:48.960 --> 24:53.920
thing is a well oiled machine. Yeah, we pick a topic, we stick to it. Yeah. Tonight's topic is

24:53.920 --> 24:57.680
infidelity. All right, I'm going to ask another question from the audience here, Dan. All right.

24:57.680 --> 25:04.880
Somebody writes, do you think anyone with a list of celebrities they're allowed to cheat on with

25:04.880 --> 25:14.000
has ever been able to cross one off? I get distracted by the concept of that before because

25:14.000 --> 25:19.920
it felt like that whole hall pass, whatever you call it, celebrity pass thing. So douchey.

25:19.920 --> 25:25.920
So, like, it really flies in the face of my whole, you know, like the idea that's like,

25:27.200 --> 25:32.480
well, I'm, I'm fucking you, but we both agree Paris Hilton walked in, right?

25:35.440 --> 25:40.560
It's so fucking disgusting. I wonder at divorce rate is 70%. I'm more concerned about the voice

25:40.560 --> 25:47.040
that you give every other person in your life. Shoot and tap, bro. Everyone in the world is

25:47.040 --> 25:52.720
just alone. I don't know. They're all like, I go perceive them as trying to, well, you know,

25:53.440 --> 25:58.720
who came up with that? All right, how about this? Is there a scenario where you're a

25:58.720 --> 26:05.360
significant other cheats that you totally forgive them for? Does that signal scenario exist for

26:05.360 --> 26:19.520
you? Well, go big. Yeah. I mean, there's obvious, there's, I mean, there's top lines.

26:19.520 --> 26:25.920
Should we have ready for the room where anyone would, would, would cheat were like, if, okay,

26:25.920 --> 26:36.720
if there was a alien virus, no, no, no, Dan, I said, go big. There's an alien virus released on

26:36.720 --> 26:42.640
earth. And then like it dropped in like these orbs that created big explosions. So there was chaos.

26:42.640 --> 26:47.440
And then the virus got aerosol misted into the air. So the primary effect is the destruction

26:47.440 --> 26:52.000
of our infrastructure. And then while that would plunge us into chaos, which would separate me

26:52.000 --> 26:58.640
from my girlfriend, then the virus is released into the air, which threatens the survival of the

26:58.640 --> 27:07.920
human race. She meets a scientist, let's say played by Bill Pullman. While separated from me,

27:07.920 --> 27:13.680
she's the only non sterilized human being in some bunker. He's the only non sterilized man.

27:13.680 --> 27:18.880
I mean, and for some reason, they can't just put his sperm in a cup and, you know, like they really

27:18.880 --> 27:27.840
have to do it on the floor of the Library of Congress. Then the movie's over. We beat all the

27:27.840 --> 27:32.800
aliens and I walk across the Salt Lake Flats toward her and she's got a cigar in her mouth.

27:32.800 --> 27:39.840
And, you know, we did it. We saved the earth. You know, she goes like, like, we did it. I'm like,

27:39.840 --> 27:44.000
well, my God, I'm alive. You're alive. Oh, and she whispers in my ear, I had to fuck Bill Pullman.

27:44.000 --> 27:51.520
And I go like, I would have too. I would have been okay with that. But anything really smaller

27:51.520 --> 28:01.840
scale than that, I'd be like, whore. You belong to me. I think that you might just have enough

28:01.840 --> 28:05.920
pettiness in your body to still, like, three days later at Little Dom's having breakfast.

28:07.840 --> 28:11.360
This crepe's really good. Yeah, does it remind you of Bill Pullman's dick?

28:11.360 --> 28:17.440
Is it better or worse? I'm just, I'm just, I'm making a scrapbook. Honey, honey,

28:18.080 --> 28:22.320
we wouldn't have crepes anymore if I didn't fuck Bill Pullman. Yeah, no, no, I understood,

28:22.320 --> 28:28.480
understood. I'm sure you hated it. He was, he was, he was pretty good. He was pretty good.

28:28.480 --> 28:38.080
And thanks, baby. And then Paris Hilton walks in and that's my celebrity pass, which is the

28:38.080 --> 28:48.320
conceit of my new movies. Yeah, whatever, man. I don't know. I didn't want the theme to be

28:48.320 --> 28:54.080
infidelity tonight because the topic makes, I don't like watching movies where the central conceit

28:54.080 --> 29:01.680
is like this scandalous taboo, like, like coming up with ways to make it okay for people to cheat.

29:01.680 --> 29:06.160
Like it always makes me very uncomfortable. I got cheated on once and I just, I have like a,

29:06.160 --> 29:11.520
I'm a very jealous person, very, very insecure, very possessive, very, very like,

29:12.400 --> 29:19.200
I don't, it just, I don't want to be better about it. I don't, because I don't, I don't want to

29:19.200 --> 29:24.320
have like big thick calluses over the part of my body that feels pain when my girlfriend wants

29:24.320 --> 29:30.480
to fuck someone else. I want my girlfriend not to fuck other people. You know, I want, I want

29:30.480 --> 29:37.520
true love. I want, it does, it's, it, I guess it's immature, but I, yeah, it just, it bugs me.

29:37.520 --> 29:43.520
As soon as we see these Richard Gehr movies and, and like, like, he, he, he trained parrots and

29:43.520 --> 29:50.160
he was married, he was married to her in 1800s England, but then she went into a coma and then

29:50.160 --> 29:57.360
he met the parrot owner of his dreams. She's in a coma, so he couldn't like break up with her. He

29:57.360 --> 30:02.640
just had to fuck her on top of her and it's like, you're supposed to tune in and you're really

30:02.640 --> 30:07.920
just jacking off to, to a man and woman fucking on top of his wife. How come you don't write more

30:07.920 --> 30:20.320
features? Now, but Dan, you've, you said in previous podcasts or Harmontowns rather that

30:21.120 --> 30:26.560
when you are masturbating, you fantasize about your person, your, your, your girlfriend fucking

30:26.560 --> 30:32.880
somebody else. Not my girlfriend necessarily. Like more often than not, it's, that's when I'm single

30:32.880 --> 30:39.200
between relationships, when I'm very lonely, when I'm masturbating, I, the, the fantasy that creeps

30:39.200 --> 30:48.800
into my head the most often is my ex-girlfriend fucking other people. But never your current

30:48.800 --> 30:53.280
girlfriend. What's up? But never your current girlfriend. Sometimes. Really? Sometimes my

30:53.280 --> 30:59.840
current girlfriend, but, but like not, that's more in a like a, yeah, sometimes. You know, like,

30:59.840 --> 31:04.960
like I'll think of like, like weird raunchy situations where my, my, the girlfriend that I'm

31:04.960 --> 31:12.400
currently with, you know, is an insatiable kind of animal that, that, that, that's, you know,

31:12.400 --> 31:17.520
and I'm not around. It starts with self-loathing because you're, you, yeah, like I said, you

31:17.520 --> 31:22.880
can't, I can't put myself in a sexual situation very easily. Like it's easier the path of least

31:22.880 --> 31:29.680
resistances for me to not be there if it's really sexy. Because I look like Randy Quaid.

31:31.120 --> 31:37.200
And you don't, you don't cast him in nine and a half weeks. You, you put him in, in vacation three.

31:38.960 --> 31:45.760
And, and not even in the lead role. But, but, so, yeah, and that leads to like, well, if my,

31:45.760 --> 31:50.240
if my girlfriend is fucking and I'm not there, then who's she fucking? And then you go, oh,

31:50.240 --> 31:56.720
maybe the guy's fixing the roof. I don't know. So sometimes, sometimes, but, but it's, that's like,

31:56.720 --> 32:04.320
you know, 15, 20%. But when I'm, when I'm single and I've been dumped, especially like, like,

32:04.320 --> 32:08.880
it's like a hundred percent. Like I can't get my brain out of that, out of that gutter.

32:10.560 --> 32:15.600
Like where it's like, oh, my ex-girlfriend is that, that dumped me. She dumped me because

32:15.600 --> 32:20.480
she's, she's doing this and she's doing that. And I'm thinking about that. So it's like, my sexual

32:20.480 --> 32:27.200
wires are crossed with my self-hatred wires. And it's, it's terrible. It's awful. It's a picture

32:27.200 --> 32:37.840
of mental illness. But saying it into a microphone makes it all better. Thanks to everything,

32:37.840 --> 32:46.960
perfect. Nothing will ever go wrong now. Thanks everybody tonight, by the way, for calling

32:46.960 --> 32:54.000
me out on everything. What the fuck? It's my show. I think you seem a little extra on edge

32:54.000 --> 32:59.200
tonight. No, I've, from the moment I came up here, I've been attacked. I know you've perceived

32:59.200 --> 33:02.720
attack. A guy in the front row was going like, yeah, like, I totally agree. And you thought,

33:02.720 --> 33:07.360
like, you said, hey, shut the fuck up, man. Like, no, that's not true. Can we, can we, what's your

33:07.360 --> 33:17.840
name guy that looks exactly like a Kiva Schaefer? What's, what's your name? Levi? Well, don't do

33:17.840 --> 33:21.280
too much talking because when you're off mic, having heard the podcast recording thing, oh,

33:21.280 --> 33:24.800
hey, give him a mic, give him a mic. What was the thing, what was the thing you just called me?

33:24.800 --> 33:29.440
A guy that looks exactly like a Kiva Schaefer. A friend of ours, he's a writer and a very funny

33:29.440 --> 33:37.920
guy. Don't know what I'm 25. Should I know that? He's 22. Fuck you. Is he here tonight? Can I

33:37.920 --> 33:43.760
fight him? Fuck him. Like, should I know it? Don't see, he's defensive too. Because of you,

33:43.760 --> 33:47.840
though. I, well, can we do it? Can we do a thing? Like, like, like, like, like,

33:47.840 --> 33:52.640
would you just tell me, tell me about the first, tell me about, I'm trying to think of like an

33:52.640 --> 34:03.280
easy, like, tell me about your favorite Christmas. No. Okay. All right. You guys are meant for each

34:03.280 --> 34:08.000
other. All right. Well, tell me, tell me, what's your favorite, what's your favorite TV show? Or

34:08.000 --> 34:12.560
just a good one, just anyone doesn't have to be your favorite. Adam, shut up. Don't heckle, a

34:12.560 --> 34:24.080
double heckler. It's a fucking inception of... We get a double heckler. It's a biosphere's

34:24.080 --> 34:28.720
erupt, it's like a fractal fucking flower pattern of people. The hecklers are heckling the hecklers.

34:30.240 --> 34:40.000
I'm not heckling at all. No, no, no, no. Well, Levi, Adam, quiet. Levi, tell me about a favorite

34:40.000 --> 34:44.800
show of yours. Strange of the Candy. Okay. Just tell me, tell me, start, start talking about why

34:44.800 --> 34:58.880
it's good. It's got Stephen Colbert. That's what you thought happens? Yeah. That's exactly what

34:58.880 --> 35:04.000
happened. I was saying, I was saying eagle, eagle's fuck as they're going to the thing and I just,

35:04.000 --> 35:12.480
I just like, they're dying. Dan, I was sitting, I have the best seat in the house because I

35:12.480 --> 35:19.200
can see you and Levi perfectly. And he was just like, fuck yeah, they're dying out there. It was

35:19.200 --> 35:24.880
on your side. You had a comrade. Yes, we found out he was on my side, but I'm telling you,

35:24.880 --> 35:30.400
the customer is always right. I'm a customer base of one. If the guy behind the microphone thinks

35:30.400 --> 35:37.520
that someone is, is, is, is like a distraction. He's right. I'm right. I'm definitely right.

35:38.880 --> 35:44.080
You're louder. So yeah, that's, that's how it works. Now he's got a microphone. No, it doesn't.

35:44.960 --> 35:48.720
Now we're on even ground. Yeah. No, here's the thing. Your name's going to my suicide note

35:48.720 --> 35:53.920
tonight, buddy. Like, no, you're fucked. So the audience doesn't, they don't like this. They don't

35:53.920 --> 35:59.120
like the chaos. They don't like the, no, no, we, we, that's what's happening now. That's the thing.

35:59.120 --> 36:04.800
That's the thing. All right. Levi, keep the microphone. Keep talking into it. No, no, no,

36:04.800 --> 36:08.320
no, because, because pink hair is about to grab the mic. I'm taking that away. I mean,

36:08.320 --> 36:14.720
it rolls downhill. There's chaos and there's chaos. This has nothing to do with power dynamics. It

36:14.720 --> 36:20.320
has everything to do with intent and emotion and dynamics. What I'm saying is not that I'm

36:20.320 --> 36:24.720
louder than you or that you're being too loud. What I'm saying is that your way of expressing

36:24.720 --> 36:30.400
agreement to me with these lights in my face looks an awful lot like a drowning man.

36:32.320 --> 36:37.760
Everyone else does that. What they just did. You were, you went, he's saying I wouldn't do it.

36:40.320 --> 36:46.000
And I thought it meant that your mother had been raped by an eagle. And I wanted to talk

36:46.000 --> 36:49.440
about it, by the way. I didn't just point at your shirt and go, where'd you get it? Ray

36:49.440 --> 36:55.360
Charles at a garage sale. Go fuck yourself, faggot. I didn't do anything. I didn't bully you. I

36:55.360 --> 37:00.480
said, what's going on down here? The same way I did to that fucking asshole outside Sarah Silverman's

37:00.480 --> 37:08.000
party. What do you mean party's over? How fuck you, my shoes untied. You got my full attention now.

37:08.000 --> 37:15.040
My brain's the size of a fucking planet. How much of it do you want? You want all of it?

37:15.040 --> 37:23.120
I'll give you all of it. You're not going to like it. I'm thinking about a new TV show.

37:23.840 --> 37:29.120
It's going to make everyone happy. Party's over. Eagles are dying. Your shoes untied.

37:29.120 --> 37:34.320
Is it about aliens that drop pods of things? That was good. Remember when I came up with?

37:35.760 --> 37:39.040
Hey, go, what, think about your girlfriend's second dicks? Will Bill Pullman's in it? That's

37:39.040 --> 37:48.080
a fucking box office dynamite. You see what's going on up here? I deserve space. I'll reward

37:48.080 --> 37:58.480
you for having it. I have Aspergers. Do you think so? No, I diagnosed myself with it after taking

37:58.480 --> 38:09.680
an online quiz and reading some conversations in a forum. Was one of the symptoms you take online

38:09.680 --> 38:17.840
Aspergers quizzes? Yeah, yeah. I don't have an excuse. I'm a bad person. I'm a bad,

38:17.840 --> 38:21.920
unlikable person. Would you be happier if you found out that you did have some sort of diagnosable

38:21.920 --> 38:28.960
illness like Aspergers? Well, like Aaron said, I'd rather it be one that's named after me. I'd

38:28.960 --> 38:35.120
rather not have this Asperger guy on my shit. Like that guy, Narcissus. Yeah, exactly. I'd

38:35.120 --> 38:45.920
like to have people after me call themselves Harmon Burgers. As if the word burger is part of the...

38:47.280 --> 38:51.200
I don't know. Well, you guys are throwing me. Congratulations. I mean, that's what you get.

38:51.200 --> 38:56.560
You cracked the walnut. Now you get the chewy, neurotic nut in the middle.

38:57.200 --> 39:04.000
Well, we have to bring fucking Spencer up here. We have a real treat in store tonight.

39:04.960 --> 39:10.880
My applause. How many of you have never heard of or know nothing about Dungeons and Dragons? My

39:10.880 --> 39:20.880
applause. I heard Silas start laughing, but then there was... Sorry, go ahead. Anybody who knows

39:20.880 --> 39:26.960
nothing about Dungeons and Dragons? I'm one of those people. All right, so several, like six or seven

39:26.960 --> 39:34.160
or eight. Yeah. But I was just laughing because I'm just very proud of my audience. Yes. We are

39:34.160 --> 39:41.680
indeed in the back room of a comic book store right now. And three Harmontowns ago, Dan brought

39:41.680 --> 39:47.280
up the idea of possibly having a dungeon master so we could play Dungeons and Dragons. And there

39:47.280 --> 39:50.960
was a gentleman in our audience that night who could not have possibly known that we were going

39:50.960 --> 39:56.480
to talk about that, who shot his hand in the air. So then last week, we brought him up again and we

39:56.480 --> 40:01.680
came up with characters. Jeff decided that he wanted to be a gnome barbarian. Correct.

40:01.680 --> 40:07.200
I was trying to go out of character. The audience picked the name of Quark.

40:08.480 --> 40:14.640
Yeah. That hat kind of fell down around my ears, but I'm sticking with it. I'm Quark.

40:15.920 --> 40:21.760
And you and your audience picked the name Sharpie Buttsalot for me.

40:23.120 --> 40:28.720
We can change them. We can change those names. We shot from the hip. That's not good storytelling

40:28.720 --> 40:34.960
when you go back and change. Would I be happier with a name that wasn't Quark? Yes. The answer is

40:34.960 --> 40:42.960
yes. More importantly, you picked a gnome barbarian and I picked a human magic user.

40:43.840 --> 40:49.120
I'm first edition Dungeons and Dragons, so Spencer had to email me subsequently and go,

40:49.120 --> 40:52.800
oh, by the way, it's not just magic user. You have to pick between a wizard and a sorcerer.

40:52.800 --> 40:56.720
I picked wizard. Wizard is somebody who studies it. Adam, what are you doing?

40:56.720 --> 41:01.040
I was imagining how it wasn't going to correct you because in first part,

41:01.040 --> 41:07.920
edition gnomes can't be more varied. I think if the show, if Nike ever does give us any money,

41:08.880 --> 41:11.360
I want everyone in this audience to have a lavalier mic on.

41:12.960 --> 41:17.200
And the world's biggest soundboard. Yeah. There definitely needs to be, yeah,

41:17.200 --> 41:20.240
there's like roving drones that can just like mic people.

41:21.360 --> 41:24.960
Some of them nerd mail, we need to area mic this audience more because there's too much

41:24.960 --> 41:28.720
good shit happening. Adam, how could you not think I heard you?

41:29.360 --> 41:35.200
You're not watching Breaking Bad. I'm two feet from you. He's talking to...

41:35.200 --> 41:43.760
He was trying to help Dan. Oh, you're sticking up for just a fundamental vagrant.

41:44.960 --> 41:49.280
I don't know much about being a barbarian dwarf, but I'm pretty sure he would stand up for this

41:49.280 --> 41:53.040
guy. All right. Well, now, obviously, since we're arguing about Dungeons and Dragons,

41:53.040 --> 42:00.400
which is ratings dynamite. Let's bring the star of this Walker, Texas Ranger show up. Spencer,

42:00.400 --> 42:18.320
come on up here. How's it going? Thank you for coming back, Spencer, and thank you in advance

42:18.320 --> 42:24.560
for the work you've done since Friday. Do we have to start with this? Did you hear what was

42:24.560 --> 42:28.720
going on down here? Have you met Adam, by the way? Yeah. No, I haven't.

42:33.360 --> 42:38.720
No, I... Was that insincere to you? I'm genuinely enthused. There's a huge...

42:39.920 --> 42:43.200
Is there a weird force field up here where everybody feels like people are coming after him?

42:43.200 --> 42:49.840
No, there's just a lot of people coming after the people on stage. Spencer and I are good

42:49.840 --> 42:54.640
people and on the same side, right? Forever. They broke the fourth wall good and early this night.

42:55.920 --> 42:59.680
All right. But no, seriously. So Adam started immediately talking about some kind of...

43:04.160 --> 43:08.160
The wonderful voice amplification. Jeff just did a bit where he tried to raise the microphone

43:08.160 --> 43:14.880
at Spencer's level. Spencer's six foot four. I'm tired of that. How tall are you? We're going

43:14.880 --> 43:19.520
with six foot four, I think. You tell me, bro, I stopped measuring myself.

43:23.120 --> 43:28.320
There is a huge insecurity thing going on with that microphone. There's a weird... That's the

43:28.320 --> 43:33.760
most secure thing in the world. Fuck rulers. All right. I'm tall. That's all you need to know.

43:33.760 --> 43:38.080
Yeah. At a certain point, you stop caring. Yeah. Okay. I got you. I like this guy. Just don't give me

43:38.080 --> 43:46.880
that look when you say it. I'm sorry. I don't know, man. So for real, I just... Because really,

43:46.880 --> 43:52.560
Adam, what were you saying? What was your thing about... What were you saying? Gnomes, barbarians,

43:52.560 --> 43:59.120
what were you saying? I'm sorry. I was holding... Touching the microphone, which you're now holding

43:59.120 --> 44:04.160
and dispensing. But in the first edition... I know I've seen your D&D rule books. I thought their first

44:04.160 --> 44:08.480
edition and gnomes can't be barbarians. But I thought, if I say that out loud, Dan's going to think

44:08.480 --> 44:15.760
I'm more asperging than I think he is, Am. See, that's what the sentence is that proves itself.

44:15.760 --> 44:20.160
So I was like, I'm just going to say that quietly to someone who might get it in context. And I

44:20.160 --> 44:24.320
still upset you for which I apologize. All right. Okay. Well, all right.

44:24.320 --> 44:31.200
I didn't have to check. Did you... He was saying... Is there...

44:31.200 --> 44:34.400
Yeah, he has a fair point. He was talking about first edition. Is that correct? Yeah,

44:34.400 --> 44:38.160
we're playing 3.5 editions, so it's not an issue. But yeah, he is right.

44:41.120 --> 44:45.120
I don't know what the fuck anybody's talking about. Well, I don't either...

44:45.120 --> 44:47.840
Let me just explain it for a long time. Here we go.

44:47.840 --> 44:56.880
This is getting off in the right foot. Let's call our edition 3.6,

44:56.880 --> 45:01.600
which means that if there's an infraction, you don't have to yell out. That's the

45:01.600 --> 45:09.760
difference between 3.5 and 3.6. All right. So if I say my wizard's wearing a pointy hat,

45:09.760 --> 45:17.920
you know, and you read in Elf Magazine that he can't... Just, you know, don't run up on stage.

45:17.920 --> 45:24.000
It's getting scary in this place. I'm doing great. It's good. It's just like Fort Apache the Bronx

45:25.200 --> 45:32.960
or Assault on Precinct 17. Yeah. Take it away, Spencer. All right. Well, as we've mentioned,

45:32.960 --> 45:41.040
you've picked a gnome barbarian, Jeff. Oh, Adam's already here. I'm a gnome barbarian.

45:41.040 --> 45:46.960
All right. Is that not good? No, it's great. It's fine. I don't really know... Briefly

45:46.960 --> 45:53.120
explain to me what that means. A gnome is about... Your gnome is about 3 foot, 3 inches tall,

45:54.080 --> 46:00.560
and he angrily... That's what she said. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. It's like a kickstand, I swear.

46:00.560 --> 46:07.440
But, and he flies angrily at people with a sword a full foot longer than he is.

46:08.080 --> 46:17.440
No shit? Yeah. All right. We're back in business. Sorry. I'm 3 foot 3. I got a 4 foot 3 sword.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.440
It's slanted. That's what she said.

46:26.560 --> 46:29.200
Should I stop saying that's what she said? It's not going to happen a lot.

46:29.200 --> 46:32.240
I think that happens 8 times per game and judges a dragon, so...

46:33.440 --> 46:40.720
All right. Okay, so I fly angrily at people with a sword a foot longer than my body.

46:40.720 --> 46:46.720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I wrote you a backstory. Do you want to hear your backstory?

46:46.720 --> 46:51.680
Fucking yes. All right. Well, let me just start it off. Quark...

46:53.680 --> 46:58.800
stands tall for a gnome a full 3 foot 3 inches. When he was growing up, he was picked on by the

46:58.800 --> 47:03.520
local hooligans who insulted his ragged clothes and admittedly lackluster mental faculties on a

47:03.520 --> 47:11.600
regular basis. That is until one day he snapped in a gnomon gnome scuffle, biting the ear off the

47:11.600 --> 47:20.240
ringleader of the local gang, the cactus bunch, after they had taken his prized bandana. It was

47:20.240 --> 47:30.240
his first taste of blood. It would not be his last. All right. I love that. I love that a lot.

47:31.120 --> 47:34.080
As much as I hate gnome on gnome violence, I still...

47:36.160 --> 47:39.920
It's an epidemic. Where will it stop? But that's hopefully at the Grammys.

47:41.920 --> 47:46.800
The thing is, as you said that Spencer, I have a perfect visual image of who that character is.

47:46.800 --> 47:52.400
All right, great. And so, yeah, he hits stuff with a sword. That's about it, you know.

47:53.360 --> 47:56.080
Yeah, well, we'll get there. Yeah, no, he gets better.

47:56.080 --> 48:01.200
Is there still, as of 3.5, is it just a list of those attributes, like strength,

48:01.200 --> 48:04.880
intelligence, wisdom, all that stuff? Yeah, there's the class features. Mostly,

48:04.880 --> 48:08.400
it's attributes, feats, and skills. But yeah, there's some stuff.

48:08.400 --> 48:11.600
I thought maybe you just read down Jeff's attributes, just the main ones.

48:11.600 --> 48:17.600
Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem. He's got strength, 16. Out of how many?

48:19.120 --> 48:23.600
Tan is considered average, like 18 is like the pinnacle of human achievement.

48:25.440 --> 48:30.160
Like giant monsters. 16 is well above average. You'd be like a bodybuilder.

48:30.160 --> 48:31.200
Thank you. In the real world.

48:31.200 --> 48:42.720
Dexterity is 14, which is above average, but not like super amazing. Constitution is 17,

48:42.720 --> 48:47.200
which is really strong. That's a, you know, he can take a beating and keep on eating.

48:47.200 --> 48:50.720
Also, he can, and he can drink people under the table.

48:51.600 --> 48:58.080
You got that right. He's got a 12 intelligence, which is still kind of smart for someone who's

48:58.080 --> 49:02.480
a barbarian, but he's got 11 wisdom, which means he has no common sense.

49:03.840 --> 49:08.160
I gave him a 17 charisma because he's got a dashing smile and a winning sense of humor.

49:09.440 --> 49:10.880
That's not you. That's just the character.

49:14.880 --> 49:17.360
You're the boss, Spencer. Thank you very much.

49:17.360 --> 49:19.680
All right. Moving on to Sharpie Buttsalot.

49:21.680 --> 49:22.160
All right.

49:22.160 --> 49:28.800
Sharpie Buttsalot is a tall, dark-haired wizard and what is unmistakably a periwinkle

49:28.800 --> 49:36.400
terrycloth bathrobe. Sharpie was born to a maiden doomed to life imprisonment in the

49:36.400 --> 49:41.040
high tower of penitence. Life was hard growing up in a prison, but he started to read and learn

49:41.040 --> 49:46.880
magic at a young age. He eventually cast featherfall on himself and fell safely out of the tower and

49:46.880 --> 49:53.040
began adventuring. Yeah. All right. First level. That's as far as your story goes. We just started.

49:53.040 --> 49:58.320
You start to build the legend now. And believe me, the name Sharpie Buttsalot will be feared

49:58.320 --> 50:03.280
throughout the realm. What about my attributes? What do I got here?

50:03.280 --> 50:09.120
All right. You got a nine strength, which is still decent for your average layperson.

50:09.120 --> 50:13.200
I couldn't do a pull-up in grade school. You might still be able to. Yeah.

50:13.200 --> 50:20.480
Yeah. A 14 dexterity, which is the same as Jeff's. What's his shoe tying ability?

50:22.160 --> 50:27.760
He's got three rinks and a shoe tying. All right. Don't team up with him, Spencer. Don't

50:27.760 --> 50:31.680
break my heart. I can't help it. I will never ask you to team up with me, but don't team up with him.

50:33.200 --> 50:40.000
I'll try. 16 Constitution, which is a little, is still really strong. You can take some hits

50:40.000 --> 50:43.680
and drink a lot also. You can take some hits and eat some shits.

50:47.920 --> 50:50.160
That's my first time, man. That's my first time.

50:52.240 --> 50:57.520
I'm just trying to have a good time over here. I'm a barbarian gnome.

50:59.040 --> 51:08.480
We have a weird sense of humor, man. All right. You got a 15 wisdom, which means you're reasonably

51:08.480 --> 51:14.560
wise and you have a cool head on your shoulders. Oh, I missed 18 intelligence. Sorry about that.

51:14.560 --> 51:17.040
That's your main stat. You're really smart. Yeah.

51:21.200 --> 51:27.840
Typecasting. These were rolled randomly. These are random rolls. Yeah, kind of. Yeah.

51:28.480 --> 51:33.040
Like, I rolled them randomly and then assigned them to the stats that fit the classes. So like,

51:33.040 --> 51:37.440
he didn't have an 18 strength and not be able to cast any spells yet. That's normal. That's normal.

51:37.440 --> 51:40.880
That's just good dungeon master stuff. Well, it's good character creation. Yeah, exactly.

51:42.080 --> 51:47.520
And 11 charisma, which is above average, but you're not going to be winning any beauty contests.

51:47.520 --> 51:55.760
You're no Bill Pullman. I'll have to rely on my ability of storytelling to keep my woman at home.

51:55.760 --> 52:01.520
Yeah. You got a crossbow and some spells. You can shrink people down and make things light up.

52:01.520 --> 52:05.280
I can shoot a crossbow? Yeah, you got a crossbow because sometimes you run out of spells and

52:05.280 --> 52:10.480
don't want to die. Oh, that's nice. All right. Well, is there anything else you need to add,

52:10.480 --> 52:13.840
Spencer? Do you want to talk about how we proceed now that we have our characters?

52:14.480 --> 52:19.520
Yeah. I mean, basically, should we try to play a 15 minute adventure next to Harmontown? What do

52:19.520 --> 52:27.920
you say, audience? Yeah. Well, they're not going to boo. We'll find out if there's a good idea

52:27.920 --> 52:32.720
or a bad one. But maybe we should... No, I said we kick this off. Next time in town, we get

52:32.720 --> 52:38.160
Sharpie and Quark meet in the field of battle. And so what do you need to do that? Should we

52:38.160 --> 52:42.800
next time... Should we put a little table over there so that you have a place to roll dice?

52:42.800 --> 52:47.760
Yeah. Just roll dice and maps and things. I don't need that many maps, but yeah, dice.

52:47.760 --> 52:53.200
All right. Okay. So we'll give... I think so we give that a shot at the next Harmontown and see

52:53.200 --> 53:08.880
how it goes from there. All right. Thank you, Spencer. That's a lot of work Spencer's putting in

53:08.880 --> 53:13.760
for us. It's nice of him. I think we got the right man for the job though. I think so. He's

53:13.760 --> 53:28.000
lovable, isn't he? Yeah. He approaches his job with sincerity. I did an interview today, a small

53:28.000 --> 53:32.800
one with a guy from Time Magazine, which I think most of the time when they say you're doing an

53:32.800 --> 53:38.800
interview for time, I think they actually just mean and they're applauding the arrival of the

53:38.800 --> 53:44.240
vodka. I did an interview with a guy on the phone just about the Anomalysa Kickstarter.

53:46.240 --> 53:50.800
Why don't you explain that briefly for people that don't know? Go donate. If the time's not

53:50.800 --> 53:56.160
up yet, go to Kickstarter. Look for Anomalysa. It's a Charlie Kaufman script that we're producing

53:56.160 --> 54:00.480
through our studio Starburns. It's going to be a stop motion feature written by Charlie Kaufman.

54:00.480 --> 54:05.120
You can go kick in some money and we'll make it as good as we can, as well as we can. See,

54:05.120 --> 54:12.560
we'll do a grammar check if you give us enough money. The guy that interviewed me from Time,

54:13.840 --> 54:18.960
his name was Harry McCracken. And that's it. That's the end of that story.

54:19.920 --> 54:23.680
For real? I wrote that in my... Is it a nom de plume or that's his name?

54:23.680 --> 54:29.600
I don't know. Phil's brother? You know. You worked for him? This is actual name.

54:29.600 --> 54:33.280
He's right for PC World. Harry McCracken.

54:35.280 --> 54:40.320
I didn't mean to talk. No, no, no. God damn it. I didn't mean to become Ming the Merciless.

54:43.600 --> 54:47.520
A guy from the audience just said, I worked for Harry McCracken and that's his real name.

54:47.520 --> 54:51.920
You know what I think happened? I think Spencer came up here and dispelled some of the evil magic

54:51.920 --> 54:56.320
that was up on that stage. Well, I can't wait to listen to the recording of tonight and see who

54:56.320 --> 55:02.400
went wrong where. But I did not feel like I came up here with any negative energy. I guess I said

55:02.400 --> 55:08.800
the first thing I said is, hey, pink hair, you're going to make trouble. I blame pink hair.

55:09.360 --> 55:13.040
That's what it is. You came out and blamed pink hair, but she hadn't even done anything as far as I

55:13.040 --> 55:17.520
had seen. Thank you. Thank you. Did something go wrong in the line? Did you meet her earlier?

55:17.520 --> 55:22.640
No, it didn't go wrong. I was being sincere. My first thought, because I saw the pink hair,

55:22.640 --> 55:28.400
and then I thought, trouble. Because in the line, she was excited. You were excited.

55:29.680 --> 55:36.400
I know. You don't have to. I know why. No, it's not true. Because it can be... Well, look what

55:36.400 --> 55:41.360
happened. I guess the story we're learning, the ironic Greek myth is that I thought it would be

55:41.360 --> 55:44.640
trouble. I tried to prevent the trouble. I caused all the trouble. Is that what we're learning?

55:44.640 --> 55:53.760
I caused the trouble. Yes, so I caused the trouble. Geez. Take it to the bank. It's

55:53.760 --> 55:59.040
the last check you're going to get. It's the last time I'm ever going to be wrong about anything.

56:00.080 --> 56:04.960
Promise you that. Sometimes at Harbin Town, I have to lay down the law.

56:04.960 --> 56:16.000
All right. What else is on the docket? Let's do some more infidelity questions, apparently.

56:16.000 --> 56:25.440
How about now? Here's a goodie. Somebody in the audience writes, I am a gay male. I recently

56:25.440 --> 56:30.960
stopped seeing a guy because he insisted on a, quote, open relationship. He insisted that it

56:30.960 --> 56:37.600
would only be physical and not emotional. Is a, quote, physically open relationship possible or

56:37.600 --> 56:44.400
any kind for that matter? Boy, that's a lot of spaghetti. That's... If I'm getting him right,

56:45.040 --> 56:51.120
he's saying that his partner said, let's be in an open relationship. But he insisted it would only

56:51.120 --> 56:56.000
be physical and not emotional. Well, by it, he means what? The new relationship? The new relationship

56:56.000 --> 56:59.200
would only be a physical. I'm only going to fuck another guy. I'm not going to fall in love with

56:59.200 --> 57:01.200
another guy. I'm not going to love another guy. I'm just going to fuck another guy. I'm just going

57:01.200 --> 57:06.800
to filate him frequently. Well, and that's it. But yeah, well, wait. And so his final question is,

57:06.800 --> 57:12.800
is that possible? Is there such a thing as a physically open relationship? I don't think so.

57:12.800 --> 57:18.800
And I don't think the rules are probably any different for our gay friends, our fine feathered

57:18.800 --> 57:33.840
gay friends. I picture them as like a hawk species in a dive. Second wave. That guy was gay. The

57:33.840 --> 57:39.120
actor that played the leader of the Hawkman in Flash Gordon. Brian Blessed, whom I love. Yeah,

57:39.120 --> 57:43.600
he was a big burly gay dude who was awesome as the leader of the Hawkman. Gay is a French

57:43.600 --> 57:49.040
word. That's why I said our fine feathered gay friends. I was picturing like a battalion of

57:49.040 --> 57:53.840
when I said our gay friends, I just pictured looking at a portal in a spaceship and seeing

57:53.840 --> 58:03.920
like a fleet of hawk people that were there to save the day. I'm sure it's the same for

58:03.920 --> 58:07.440
everybody. I can't tell if that's diminishing gay people or really exalting them. Well,

58:07.440 --> 58:14.480
it's up to them. I don't know. Up to them in the hawks. When the hawks have sex in the air,

58:14.480 --> 58:23.120
though, man, they die. Don't get Levi fucking hysterical to a point where I think he's heckling

58:23.120 --> 58:35.200
me. Just stop it. Pink hair. God damn it. Pink hair and Levi. It's like having a bundle of

58:35.200 --> 58:41.440
dynamite in the front row. It's not my fault. Sweating nitroglycerin. It's like you shake it

58:41.440 --> 58:54.320
and it blows up. Okay. Gay people, hear my voice. Sex comes easier for you because men are pigs

58:54.320 --> 58:59.760
and gay men couples are easier to hook up and stuff. But I think that's the only difference.

58:59.760 --> 59:03.680
I imagine that everyone that goes to bed together no matter what they're doing

59:03.680 --> 59:08.800
is cosmically intermingling a little bit. There's an emotional component to all sex. Otherwise,

59:08.800 --> 59:13.680
all we'd all do is jerk off. If you've got the same energy from an orgasm no matter what you

59:13.680 --> 59:20.720
were doing, it doesn't matter what promises you make. So as much as this poor gentleman probably

59:20.720 --> 59:26.560
doesn't need or want to hear it, his mate that's saying, can I be in an open room? I'm agreeing

59:26.560 --> 59:32.320
with his obvious anxiety, which is, no, there's no such thing as a physical. You can't love

59:32.320 --> 59:37.360
one guy and then be physical with another guy and never the twain shall meet.

59:37.360 --> 59:40.480
Several people, I went through the questions that people wrote down in the audience.

59:42.640 --> 59:50.240
Surprisingly, almost word for word people asked, and several of you asked, what's worse,

59:51.040 --> 59:57.600
physically cheating or emotionally cheating? That was on everybody's minds. What would be

59:57.600 --> 01:00:03.120
more hurtful? I'm way too old fashioned to. I think that there are people who are better equipped

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:10.560
for this because I don't think my advice would be or my insights would be as valid. I've often

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:15.680
observed that people who are growing up at an age of text messaging and Facebooking and all this

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:22.320
stuff, they are a little more shielded in the right places. I'm a 39-year-old maniac. When I

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:29.600
have a girlfriend, I get nervous and jealous very easily. I think that that's sort of intertwined

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:35.680
with the definition of loving somebody. It doesn't make any logical sense, though. It's not practical.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.480
So I'm not Dr. Phil about when it comes to when you should be jealous and possessive.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:44.160
There's a million people out there, some of them might be in the audience, who are actually capable

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:49.920
of doing weird, swingery stuff and totally keeping everything together. Bruce Willis and

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.480
Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore, whoever the fuck they all, you see a tablet, they're all in a boat

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.360
together, like, hey, we all fucked each other. Who cares? Let's go fishing. It is possible for

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:05.680
people to be mature. I was staying in a hotel one time. I was supposed to fly out in the morning,

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:10.640
but for some reason the flight got canceled, so I had to stay in Reno, Nevada for a night,

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:15.600
and we stayed at one of the casinos there, one of the big hotel casinos there. And I don't know

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:21.120
if you've ever been to Reno. It's a little mini country cowboy Vegas, the biggest little city

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:27.360
in the world, I think they call it. And are you from there? No. Keep it down, man. No, sir.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:37.040
But we stayed at this casino, and I was walking to my hotel room, and there's me and some of the

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:42.960
guys I got a comedy show with, and we're walking to our hotel room, and kind of like 80% of the

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:48.960
doorways, like the hotel doors, there was a polaroid of like a couple, like a married couple,

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:54.320
or a guy in a gal, sometimes just a guy, sometimes just a gal, but there's a polaroid taped to the

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:59.120
doors, and I don't really think anything of it. I thought it was some thing on convention. So then

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:05.040
I go down to the casino, and I'm playing roulette, and I'm sitting there, and I notice like everyone's

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:13.600
got these really, really visible, bright, like hot pink or orange wristbands on. Not everybody,

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:18.400
but a lot of people, but also the same kind of age group and style of the people that were in these

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:24.560
photos on the doors in the hotel. And so I say to the, to the, the croupier, what do you call the

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:30.320
guy at the roulette table? I said, what's going on? I go, what's the wristbands and the polaroids

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:39.040
in the door? And he goes, this fingers convention. I was like, oh, no. I was looking around, I hate

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:46.480
to be a jerk, but you wouldn't fuck any one of these people. It was pretty rough. It was pretty

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.800
rough. And I said, what's up with the polaroids in the door? And the polaroids are like, if you

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.520
like, if you see, you walk by a door and you go, oh, that's who's in this room, and you can knock on

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.360
the door. And if they want you to come in, you can either join in or watch or whatever. I mean,

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.840
I guess that's, that's all fun and fine and dandy. But I got to say that the mood in that casino was

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:10.000
tense because nobody got what they fucking wanted or paid for. Or yeah, it was, it was rough. And

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.240
there was a couple like, there were a couple of couples that were more on the sexy scale, like on

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:19.280
the sexy side of the scale. And they were just being worked on by everybody and they were really

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:24.000
bummed out. And it was, it was bad. Yeah. I, I, in a world where we haven't answered those questions

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.120
yet, I just keep it simple and just go with what my primal instinct tells me, which is that I want,

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:34.160
I want a woman and I want her to be my woman. And if that's unhealthy, it's the unhealthy choice

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:40.160
that will get me through a sea of very confusing shit. Because, because it's, every, every, every

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.160
person I've ever talked to, every anecdote I've ever heard about three ways and four ways and nine

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.720
ways and open relationships and she's my old lady, but we have a common law thing. And when we do

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:56.720
this and that guy lives in her garage and he hangs in a back costume and none of those end with

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:05.120
anyone cutting a cake, which I'm sorry. It's, I'm my parent's son. I just want to go. I just want

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:11.040
to do the chicken dance and go home and have some kids and like die. And I want to do it with one

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:19.440
person and I don't want Kevin, you know, hanging out or Natalie. I don't, those stories end with

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:25.680
probably no more. I think those people, like we owe it to them to say, like, I think that people

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:31.120
who are pursuing their bliss, like they, those people are just as right as, as monogamists.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.920
I think it's random and cosmic. It's like, it's, there's stress everywhere. It's fucking stressful.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:44.400
You don't, there's no such thing as waking up every morning with a big hard on for, for the

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:49.440
person that's three feet from you and, and, and, and being happy and then going to bed happy and

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:54.800
doing it every day. Because then if that happens, then that, that's not, human beings aren't happy

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:59.200
all the time. Happiness is defined by the unhappiness that follows it. So there is no, like, you

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:05.040
talk, I always smell a rat when I talk to people who are like, yeah, we do, you know, we cheated

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:09.600
the system. We got to, you know, it's like, this is Darla. She's with me, but, you know, we go home

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:15.360
together. We live together, but, you know, I do what I want with Stacy. And I always feel like

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.520
someone's going to kill themselves, you know, pretty soon. Stacy's going to murder somebody

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:26.400
or something's uncomfortable in bed. But if I'm wrong or if I'm right, I, I, I, there's no time

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:32.400
for me to change that fact. I'm all for kids sticking to the, the addiction, the gum that's

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:36.880
under the desk that you touch when it's there. It's like, you want a girlfriend, you want your

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:40.160
girlfriend to turn into your wife, you want your wife to turn into the mother of your children,

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:48.960
you want to, and infidelity is, is a, is the static that happens on that TV reception because

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:55.280
people fuck up, they fail, and they, they, we all, like, we fantasize and like, think that we

01:05:55.280 --> 01:06:00.080
did something wrong or something, and we fail as human beings, infidelity happens. And I don't,

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:05.600
I don't know if it's a solution to say, hey, my television station is half static. I think you're

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:10.560
just, you're saying, you're still saying the same thing. You're saying it's hard to be in a

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:15.520
relationship. And so your solution is to, is to make relationships hard. Well, somebody asked,

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:19.600
would you rather be the person that was cheated on or the person that cheated?

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:26.160
I would, I would definitely rather be cheated on. I, I, as much as, that, wow, that is a really

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:32.560
awesome question. That's, that's, that's a question of perspective, because it's certainly in the

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:39.520
long run, you would definitely rather be cheated on, because, um, fucking, like, you get to stop

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:50.560
being in a relationship and you're the hero. You get flooded with pity puss.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.400
Should you want it? Pity puss. Uh, yeah, it's, it's like, you don't even have to force it in

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.920
conversation. It's going to come up naturally. Why'd you play that song on the jig box? My wife

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:14.880
fucked someone. She, what? I would never do that. Prove it. Make love to my penis tonight forever.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:22.800
Prove you're not like my wife. Uh, you just, like, you don't, you don't, you don't break a sweat,

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:29.120
you sleep like a baby, you're, and, and, and you're not married. Yeah, better to be in the long run,

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:33.440
because you were in an unhealthy relationship if someone's capable of cheating on you.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:38.080
The problem is, if you're, it's like, like, the idea of you, you, you were in love with her,

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:42.720
and you can't live without her, and she cheated on you. That, that, so in the short term, I,

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:48.960
people jump off bridges, people jump, uh, that was an unfortunate choice of words. Tony, Tony Scott

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.760
just jumped off a bridge, uh, RIP, Tony Scott, whatever, tell whatever. It doesn't, it's not

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:58.800
a disrespect to him to use the phrase jump up a bridge. It's just unfortunate. It was just that

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:04.400
we were talking about it earlier. People, people jump off of spaceships, uh, because of relationships,

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:08.320
because of, because of people leaving them, because, because when you, that was Ridley Scott.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:19.680
When you are, yeah, let's just get it. Fuck those guys. I just, I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.800
Kidding, sorry. Everyone's a fan of everybody who's dead. Fuck you, fuck you, Phyllis Diller,

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:29.760
you piece of shit. I'm kidding. I work here, Phyllis Diller, and I love Tony and Ridley Scott.

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:36.320
Ron Polillo, you owe me money. Nice way out. Ron Polillo died. Horshack. Horshack. Horshack.

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:42.400
Welcome back, Carter, died as well. Welcome to our death segment of Harmontown. Uh, it's not.

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:46.960
This show's got it all. We got infidelity. We got judges and dragons. We got dead people. We have

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.440
a, a, a complete imbalance between the power and the power dynamic of audience and performer.

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:55.600
Levi fucked off about 10 minutes ago. We don't know where he went. He's gone.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.800
He's jumping off a bridge right now.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.400
He's, he's suffocating himself in a giant pair of acid wash pants.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:12.960
It's Levi. It's just because his name, his name is, his name is a kind of pants.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:15.920
I'm not going to repeat it.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:22.800
Please, when he comes back. I, I admire the, uh, the, the calm and comfort you have.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:27.360
I'm from Milwaukee. What? I thought you were from Las Vegas.

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:31.040
I live here, but I'm from Milwaukee. I am, as well.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:38.800
She just called Dan an asshole now. This is unpod, the back and forth is unpod castable

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.400
because no one can hear you and we don't dare give you a microphone.

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:46.800
All right. No, no. Give it, give it to her. Give it to her.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:54.800
Jesus Christ. I walked toward her with a microphone and the crowd, uh, a mutiny.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.760
But I'm just, I'm not, I'm not, there's nothing wrong with you as a human being. I'm not, I'm

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:08.400
not saying, I, okay. I just admire her zeal and her comfort of, of just completely shoehorning

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.560
herself into the show. I think it's fantastic. But as we established, okay, we got to the bottom

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:16.800
of it. I stepped up on stage. I drew first blood. I immediately all of a sudden, I shouldn't have

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:22.240
done that. I shook that can. I was doing a callback. I thought, oh, there was energy out there in the

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:26.560
line. I think I'll do a big callback. I don't know what I was thinking. I'm an idiot. I'm not,

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.760
I'm, this isn't my job. This isn't, I don't write on my tax form. I don't go show runner.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:40.400
Wait. Yes, I do. I'm not anymore, but it's a live show runner. I don't say this as a town with my

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:46.560
name on it. What the fuck were we talking about? Well, what were we just talking about? It was

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:53.760
important. No, we weren't talking about Levi jumping off bridges. I mean, we were, but we

01:10:53.760 --> 01:11:00.160
shouldn't have been infidelity. Yeah. People broken out or whatever. I, I, I, yes, I would,

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:05.600
I would rather be cheated on because the long-term, all right. Here's a short question. Woody Allen

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:15.440
thoughts. I do have thoughts because Aaron just pulled up that documentary on Woody Allen. It was

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.880
a, how many people have by applause have seen that Woody Allen documentary? That was very

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:29.200
interesting watching that. The most so revelatory, like Woody Allen is a ubiquitous genius. Like

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:34.400
he's, but he's, but everyone in this room has grown up surrounded by his movies because he

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:40.880
makes almost literally one per year and has been doing it for how many decades. And some of them

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:46.880
hit and some of them miss, but he's, he's made more good movies than, than, than any of his peers

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.480
because he's made kind of by more bad movies. I never got that, that perspective on him.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:56.640
And there's this, like the studying of his personality by talking to all of the people

01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:05.040
around him. He seems to have like, uh, I was relieved to find out that he really, he, there's

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:09.920
like, uh, his circuit board and his brain is kind of like, there's a couple of like, uh,

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:15.520
scorch marks there that, that were, which is, which is nice because it means that we don't all

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.880
owe it to ourselves to go home and try to be Woody Allen. Like, because he, it's clearly like,

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.600
I think it's genetic. I think it's like neurological. He does that. He was, there's like,

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:31.440
what, what was the movie that he was writing in the documentary? He was writing one of his

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:37.360
good movies while all of the shit was going down in the tabloids about him, uh, and Sun Yi.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.240
Does anyone, can anyone shout it out to them? Who's writing husband's wives? That was it. Wait,

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:47.200
was that a good one or not? Was it Broadway, Danny Rose or husband's wives? No, couldn't have been

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:52.160
Broadway, Danny Rose. Those are both good movies. I don't think it was Bullets over Broadway either.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:59.280
It's husband's wives probably. Curly Sue. Curly Sue. This is a story about him like taking phone

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:04.080
calls with his lawyer and going like, you know, you might want to get a blood sample. Um, and then

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.560
coming back and sitting down and just riffing bits to do this trick. And the end result is a fine

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.560
movie that everyone enjoyed. Like he, he, and then they have that montage of everyone going,

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.200
he compartmentalizes, he compartmentalizes, he compartmentalizes. Like he, the, the, another

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:23.520
word for compartmentalizing is like, uh, you know, autism. He's, he is like, like there's

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.080
different parts of his brain that are incapable of crossing into other parts of his brain. And

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:33.920
he's one of those rare people that like, like those compartments are shaped in a Tetris block

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:39.680
that makes like movies. And he just, just keeps making them and making like good ones and good

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:44.720
ones and good ones. To me, it was a relief because I'm a narcissist and everyone who does

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:49.120
anything creative, I don't care if you make a rocking chair or a stained glass window. I'm,

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:56.640
my big thought in my head is like, do I need to prove that I can do that better or worse? Or,

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.840
you know, like, like, is that, am I under threat here? Do I need to go, what do I,

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:04.000
you beat your wife, right? That's why you make such good stained glass windows. I don't know.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.600
Like I'm always, I'm always looking for some way to make myself feel at ease that I am

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:16.000
still a contributor to my society, that what I do is important and, and that I'm doing it right

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.240
and that I don't need to work harder at it or less hard at it. And watching that documentary

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:26.160
really relaxed me because Woody Allen has haunted me a long time because I always think like, Jesus

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:31.760
Christ, how do you do what he does? Well, you said to me recently that there might be some

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.000
money coming in on syndication. And if you ever got that money coming in that you would stop writing,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.840
you said this before that you might retire, you would never work again, you would just do that,

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:43.360
but I don't, I don't imagine that you would be able to do that. No, I don't think I would.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.440
Yeah. So you say that, but you're, that's,

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.480
Well, I say that, yeah, I say that because I feel like I'm, yeah, I'm trying to win some game against

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.680
people that I hate. Like I, I don't want to be rich and I won't care, but I'll always care. I was

01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:03.600
like, yeah, I'll die like writing the worst shit that I've ever written. I'll always, I'm all fucked

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:12.080
up. Like, don't say aw. If they're gonna say aw, that's when they should say it. I will, I will,

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:19.920
like, yeah, I will like, I will be 70 years old if I'm lucky. And I'll like, I'll just be working

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:26.480
on some fucking piece of garbage. Like I'll just be trying to prove that I'm trying to untie some

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.880
knot in my head of like, how you're supposed to make yourself happy. I just talked to Mitch

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:37.200
Hurwitz about this name drop. I was on the set of Arrested Development and met Mitch Hurwitz.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:45.680
And, and he said so many things that I had been thinking, which it was so, such a great thing

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:51.600
to hear him say it. And one of the things that we talked about was the fact that when we make things,

01:15:53.760 --> 01:16:00.080
we're trying to entertain everyone in the world. We're not ever, ever, ever trying to exclude

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:05.360
anybody. And the, but the, but the only way you could possibly ever stand a chance of entertaining

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:10.880
everybody is if you're entertaining yourself. There's no, otherwise you're a hack. You don't,

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:17.520
you don't say, well, people like got milk. That's a funny joke. So if you say got milk,

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.360
then everyone will laugh. That's what I've learned. And you're not laughing the whole time. It's like,

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:25.120
it's garbage. It's hackery. And it works for some people because they get lucky,

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:28.720
because there's only so much shit to watch out there. But the truth is, if you really want

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:33.040
to make people happy, you have to know who you are and what you want and express it and make

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:38.160
yourself laugh if you're doing comedy. And then it's your tough luck if only three million people

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:43.600
like it, as opposed to 18 million people. It's, it's, it's Mitch, Mitch Hurwitz was exactly the

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.920
same as me going like, I wish, I wish everybody liked everything that I did. I really do. But

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:52.880
I'm not going to, I'm not going to change what he does because then what do we be doing? He'd be

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:57.200
writing like an animated penguin movie. He doesn't, what would he, it would be, it would be terrible.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:01.680
It would be worse than an animated penguin movie that you like. Like there's one that you like,

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:05.840
and it was written by a guy who was operating the top of his game. He woke up with a boner for

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:11.520
animated penguins. Mitch Hurwitz would be slumming it and then like betraying you. You'd be watching

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:20.240
a liar lie. And so he has to do what he has to do at the top of his RPMs and just like be bummed out.

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:25.840
What were we talking about? Infidelity? Yeah. Woody Allen. Oh, Woody Allen. Yes, Woody Allen.

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:30.320
Yeah. So whatever. It relaxed me a lot to watch that documentary. Those were my thoughts. I had a

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:34.240
lot of thoughts. Aaron and I talked about Woody Allen for a long time. Aaron's observation was

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:40.880
like, yeah, it's like, he's a jazz musician on top of all this. Like he has this weird disconnection

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.040
where he's able to focus on people and he doesn't, he doesn't work with the actors. He just casts

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:48.960
people like they're crayons in a crayon box. He doesn't even talk to them. And then he sends them

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:54.640
a script and says, you can do, do, do the lines the way I wrote them or don't. And if anyone

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.560
else said that, they'd be full of shit. You know, they'd be just saying that because he really

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:02.000
means it. He doesn't give a fuck if you do the script or not. He's Woody Allen and he doesn't

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.200
care if you do his script. And then he gets the actor, he's on the set and he's, he described it

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:12.560
as like, he's like, the people do the take, you know, and you, you know, you say cut and then

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:17.760
they look at you like, you know, did I do a good job? And of course you can't stare at them all

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:23.440
day. So you have to say something. So you say, that was fine. It's like, that's a person talking

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:28.960
that's like, people are mannequins to him. They are, they're like, like, he's just playing a video

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:33.680
game where, where everyone is like an obstacle to get past so that he can do what he wants to do.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:39.360
He's just playing Grand Theft Auto. And his goal is to, is to make the most movies ever,

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:43.360
which is, which is great. You can emulate yourself. But you, but you, like the relieving

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.320
thing is that no, his brain is shaped different. You can't, you got to do what you want to do.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:51.600
He's doing what he wants to do. What's the difference of the shape of your brain that

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:59.520
makes you do what you do well? Mind shape like a planet. And it has beautiful clouds. I don't know.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:04.320
What would be your crowning achievement? Or is there such a thing as something you want?

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.360
Like, would you like, you know, best screenplay or something like that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Best

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:14.400
original screenplay of Oscar. That would be, if I got that, then I would, it would be hard to get

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:22.080
up the next day. I would probably play a lot of Minecraft after I got, I would, I would be like,

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:27.760
okay, what am I, you know, like, let's go on a hike. Yeah. If can I hike my way to another one

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:34.400
of these motherfuckers? How about more chocolate pudding? Will you, but will you endeavor to do

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:38.160
that? What do you, do you think? Yeah, I want to, I want to. There was times that, you know,

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:43.440
Dan and I were friends and you know, like, like years ago when he was broke or I was broke and

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:46.640
we're both helping each other out and stuff like that. And like, and you have these scripted ideas,

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.640
like, and it was times when you, you seemed like more of a feature writer than a TV writer.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.680
That's why I came out here. I didn't even know you could write TV. Like most of us,

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:58.480
I thought the people on TV were making it up. You just kind of felt that when you watch TV.

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:04.560
Like, oh, Ellen, all those hilarious in the Korean War. He should do more stuff. He's great.

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:08.320
Jerry Seinfeld's like, whoa, what a great observation about, about socks.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:14.480
Why didn't they think of putting him with Kramer for a long time ago? You just,

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:19.680
yeah, I have that feeling about TV. It doesn't feel like it's written if it's good. And yeah,

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:24.560
I never, the TV I fell into on accident. I wanted to write movies. I wanted, before that,

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:30.800
I wanted to write books. I always wanted to be legit. Don't quote me, man, because I had said,

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:41.040
shit, easy, look him up. Died of AIDS, jumped off the bridge of AIDS. And you know,

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:48.880
Phyllis Diller, whom I love, she died today, right? And she was 95 and she died in her sleep. And a

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:53.520
whoever found her, like, was one of her children. So someone came into the house and found her

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:57.600
and she had a smile on her face. Oh, come on. And I was like, that's, that's how you fucking do it.

01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:03.440
Why can't we all, why can't we all live to between 70 and 90 and just turn to dust?

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:10.400
Why does it always have to be like, like, his heart did this and his liver did that and his lung

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:16.720
had this thing. And then he had a complicated thing. And it's a waste. I met Phyllis Diller after

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:23.840
a show at the improv. I like, I think she was 89. And she put down in my presence four pretty big

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:29.600
beef eater, gin martinis. And she was just solid as a rock. And also I was on stage for a while.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:34.240
So she probably, she might have had a couple in there. And she had diamond the size of like,

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:38.880
like a billiard ball. Apparently that was worth like just a zillion dollars. And she,

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:43.840
she's quite wealthy. She done very well for us off. And she was one of the first female comedians

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:48.160
that like made it like possible for women. And she was just like this, this beautiful,

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:51.600
and she made her whole career about being ugly, but she really wasn't. She was really beautiful.

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:57.840
She was very pretty. And she was 37 years old when she started. She had five kids or something

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:02.400
like that. She was a housewife. And she was 37 years old when she started her career. And she

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:08.480
died a beloved, amazing person at 95 years old with a fucking smile on her face. It made me so

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:12.720
happy and also wistful and sad all day long. I think I put me in a very strange mood today.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:16.960
I was like, you couldn't do it any better than that. I don't think. Well, Tony Scott put me in a

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:21.920
strange mood. I'm not going to, I'm not going to blab. Obviously my relationship with pink hair

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:26.880
is what really set things off. But I had Tony's, the Tony Scott thing put me in a bad mood because

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:32.320
it reminded me of spaulding gray. It reminded me a hundred Thompson. I don't like suicides. It made

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.800
me very uncomfortable because I feel like I'm a very weak person. And I feel like if I get sick,

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:41.120
and it's rumored that I'm, you look for reasons with this stuff. I want to know why did Tony

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:45.280
Scott do this? I heard the rumor that he had terminal brain cancer. I don't know if that's

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:52.240
still a rumor. Does anybody out there know? Still a rumor. But that makes me very uncomfortable

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:58.960
because it just, it feels too close to home. It feels too close to some hypothetical home.

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:06.640
I feel like I wouldn't have the strength to endure hardship. I don't, I have a told on Friday the

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:13.440
story of me calling an ambulance because I had too much coffee. And I was miserable. I was like,

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:18.000
I'm a pretty, I'm a pretty cut off your nose despite your face guy. I'm a pretty like,

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:24.000
fuck you if you don't want me. And I, you know, if a guy makes a joke about the party being over,

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:29.040
you know, yeah, I might, I might just, just to teach him a lesson, just blow my brains out.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:36.720
That's a joke. If you get diagnosed with a terminal illness, just to walk around with that,

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:43.680
pick your time, pick your time. Hey, can I get a loan? I just want to get a loan at this bank.

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:51.840
Well, you know, got milk. Just to, just to, just to teach one person an invaluable lesson.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:56.160
Shoes untied, bro. Oh, really? Well, then fuck it.

01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:03.440
