{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:23.480\nHere you hear you, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:23.480 --> 00:27.960\nWelcome to the Nerdmelt Theater in Hollywood, California, and you listening out in podcast\n\n00:27.960 --> 00:32.160\nland. Thank you for joining us. Please won't you all either physically or spiritually put\n\n00:32.160 --> 00:48.200\nyour hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n00:48.200 --> 00:57.840\nAre you going to be troubled tonight, pink hair? All right, pink hair in line. I parked here earlier\n\n00:57.840 --> 01:05.880\nto go meet some friends. Well, yeah, because you screamed at me and I was terrified. I blew you\n\n01:05.880 --> 01:12.960\na kiss because I was afraid for my own safety. Well, what's your name for fuck's sake? Christina.\n\n01:12.960 --> 01:19.680\nChristina, everybody. Security, keep an eye on Christina. You may regret that applause in a\n\n01:19.680 --> 01:29.400\nmoment. Cynthia, Christina. Pink hair. Pink hair is the only primary crime. She's very excited to\n\n01:29.400 --> 01:35.160\nbe here tonight. Very excited, very excited to be near either of us. Very excited to be here with\n\n01:35.160 --> 01:40.520\nall of you. Unfortunately, her secondary crime is her excitement is causing her to be a real\n\n01:40.520 --> 01:48.200\nhooligan. Now I made you sad. Okay, well, it's good. I need to be able to make you sad. That's\n\n01:48.200 --> 01:55.920\nthe threat of a hooligan. Okay, good. That's the only difference between... Christina, have you\n\n01:55.920 --> 02:03.040\nbeen here to Harmontown before? You're from Las Vegas, so this is a big deal. Being in the\n\n02:03.040 --> 02:11.840\nback room at a comic book store. Yeah, it's like being in Paris or Rome. You come from a city where\n\n02:11.840 --> 02:22.160\nthe Adams family has their own slot machine. Why do you care that you're here? Do you have\n\n02:22.160 --> 02:29.560\nany expectations or hopes or dreams tonight? Nothing? What would be your dream if you could\n\n02:29.560 --> 02:35.080\nwake up tomorrow morning? And why am I in such a good mood? Oh, because that happened. What would\n\n02:35.080 --> 02:43.120\nbe the thing that you would hope to come out of the show tonight? Okay, all right. Don't put me\n\n02:43.120 --> 02:53.400\non the spot, asshole, she just said. The gauntlet has been thrown. We're coming back to you,\n\n02:53.400 --> 03:05.760\nChristina. Mars. So curiosity has landed. And they're not going digging, by the way. The thing\n\n03:05.760 --> 03:10.320\nin the front is not a big scooper on the Curiosity rover on Mars. They got a laser on it that's\n\n03:10.320 --> 03:15.600\ngoing to evaporate rocks from a distance, and they're going to analyze rocks with a laser. Oh,\n\n03:15.600 --> 03:20.440\nyou know who's just telling me about that? Six-year-old Gil, whose podcast they did upstairs. The\n\n03:20.440 --> 03:25.840\nowner of the place has a six-year-old son who has a podcast. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. How many\n\n03:25.840 --> 03:32.200\npodcasts do you have, man? No, it's his podcast, Gil. Are you cheating on me? No, no. I was on\n\n03:32.200 --> 03:38.160\nanother person's podcast. I do that. The theme tonight is infidelity, by the way. Ah, very nice,\n\n03:38.160 --> 03:43.840\nJeff. Yes. When will you learn that I will control the shit out of this motherfucker? Thank you,\n\n03:43.840 --> 03:48.000\nJeff. I misinterpreted it. I thought it was a non-sequitur. I thought you were misunderstanding,\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:52.200\nbut actually what happened there is Jeff was segueing into our theme for tonight, which I\n\n03:52.200 --> 03:58.280\nallowed the audience in line to choose. I gave them a choice between travel, finance, and infidelity.\n\n03:58.280 --> 04:06.320\nAnd, you know, predictably enough, I should have thrown boobs in there, which was on the\n\n04:06.320 --> 04:10.600\nmaster list because then we'd be talking about boobs all night. But I figure we'll be talking\n\n04:10.600 --> 04:15.280\nabout boobs regardless. If the theme was travel, we're going to end up talking about my hemorrhoids.\n\n04:15.280 --> 04:21.720\nOur last show, I've got to say, if we can read the minutes from the last show. I listened to a\n\n04:21.720 --> 04:30.400\nrecording of it. It was based solely around the butthole, I believe. It was at a certain point,\n\n04:30.400 --> 04:35.600\nwe just started talking about things in butts. And I talked about how I once put a sharpie\n\n04:35.600 --> 04:43.520\npen in my butt. I talked about how I had a real doll at one point. Jeff talked about how he put\n\n04:43.520 --> 04:54.920\non fishnets once. See, he can't fail. I fuck a mannequin and I'm a pariah. Jeff's a transvestite\n\n04:54.920 --> 05:01.040\nand all the women are throwing their panties up for him to put on. I'm a sweet transvestite.\n\n05:01.040 --> 05:09.360\nThat's my secret. Rob Schrab came up and told us about scalding his own butt with hot water.\n\n05:09.360 --> 05:16.440\nIt just turned into a theme. I was thinking that infidelity would be, I would rather do\n\n05:16.440 --> 05:26.640\ntravel or finance, but then pink hair started freaking out. Anyways, there's a whole thing\n\n05:26.640 --> 05:33.360\nin line. The crowd, the hooligans chose infidelity as a theme. We got questions from you. Jeff will\n\n05:33.360 --> 05:39.360\ncontrol those. I haven't read them. We'll pop over to them. Why don't we give them a taste? You\n\n05:39.360 --> 05:44.080\nwant to crack one off right off the bat? Sure, why not? All right. Just from the top of the pile\n\n05:44.080 --> 05:51.240\nhere out of my right suit pocket. If Troy ever cheated on Abed, who would it be with? Community\n\n05:51.240 --> 06:07.920\nquestion. Obviously it would be Britta. Do I have to think of a funny answer? No. Troy's in\n\n06:07.920 --> 06:15.600\nlove with Britta. We're talking to a guy whose show broke up with him and started fucking another\n\n06:15.600 --> 06:23.280\nshowrunner. Who do you think Troy's in love with? Do you guys watch the show? That wasn't a\n\n06:23.280 --> 06:32.400\nsecret. I'm not Damon Lindelof. You don't have to watch the episodes backwards and freeze frame\n\n06:32.400 --> 06:44.080\non the shot of his driver's license and run it through the Da Vinci matrix. He just seemed to\n\n06:44.080 --> 06:50.160\nhave a big crush on Britta, it seemed. Anyways, let's not talk about that. Let's get over that\n\n06:50.160 --> 07:00.840\nrelationship, shall we? That was an example of a question about infidelity. How deep do you want\n\n07:00.840 --> 07:04.960\nto dig on the first one? Do you want to start off light or heavy stuff? We're not talking to you,\n\n07:04.960 --> 07:12.200\npink hair. Holy shit. You can't go back and forth between being rambunctious and then going, I'm\n\n07:12.200 --> 07:18.080\nsorry, don't pick on me. We're going to start picking on you. You've got to keep it down to\n\n07:18.080 --> 07:28.640\nfeel the people around you. You're sitting right next to Enti. He's like a star here. He doesn't\n\n07:28.640 --> 07:32.880\nhave the right to get all. He would be playing into a stereotype if he started yelling.\n\n07:32.880 --> 07:41.480\nFor podcast people, he's talking about a black gentleman. You might remember him from one of\n\n07:41.480 --> 07:50.400\nour numerous podcasts about race. Episodes three through eight, which the theme ended up being\n\n07:50.400 --> 07:55.760\nrace. You weren't here last time, were you? We thought we had really committed a crime. We had\n\n07:55.760 --> 08:03.280\ndone something terrible. Enti's like the last Native American. If he goes away, we littered too\n\n08:03.280 --> 08:12.880\nmuch. We're comforted by his presence. We're hanging onto that bow. What blows my mind is\n\n08:12.880 --> 08:18.360\nthat you continue. You seem like a very nice kind of mild mannered dude. You still sit right in\n\n08:18.360 --> 08:25.000\nthe front row every time. It's like a splash zone. He's an aspiring writer, right, Enti? You\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:31.280\nwant to be a writer? I don't know if that maybe that's offensive. Maybe you are a writer. I think\n\n08:31.280 --> 08:36.560\nyou want to be a writer. Okay. I don't know. Maybe he wrote a fucking thing for his school\n\n08:36.560 --> 08:45.480\npaper. He's going to go home and cut himself. He didn't acknowledge my poetry series. Enti\n\n08:45.480 --> 08:58.040\nheart full soul. I have a question for Pink Hair Lady real quick. Do you live in the 714 area\n\n08:58.040 --> 09:05.760\nhere? Someone wrote down call me and there's a phone number. There's Pink Lipstick all over it.\n\n09:05.760 --> 09:19.160\nSomeone shat their hand up. Who was it? All right. That's not your boyfriend that you came\n\n09:19.160 --> 09:26.960\nhere with, right? You're not doing this to him. Okay. All right. Well, tonight is weird. Should\n\n09:26.960 --> 09:35.840\nwe just go get Jeffrey Ross, bring him up here? It feels like a toxic, ugly night is why I asked\n\n09:35.840 --> 09:44.480\nthat question. No, it's going to be fine. Haremontown should be a safe place. The original\n\n09:44.480 --> 09:51.080\nconceit is I need to start a colony somewhere where we can all be cool to one another. I have\n\n09:51.080 --> 09:55.960\nsome issues that I would bring to bear immediately. You can have your shoes untied and no one can\n\n09:55.960 --> 10:01.360\nsay your shoes are untied unless they really mean it well instead of just saying your shoes are\n\n10:01.360 --> 10:05.000\nuntied just to assert themselves over you, which is what I'm convinced people do when they say\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:09.360\nyour shoes are untied. But I've said to you and I've heard people say to you that your shoes were\n\n10:09.360 --> 10:15.720\nuntied in the nicest possible tone and you still took great umbrage. They still mean it. Can I\n\n10:15.720 --> 10:23.120\ntell you a story about me taking umbrage that happened outside? Time for a Dan's umbrage corner.\n\n10:23.120 --> 10:36.880\nMy wonderful girlfriend Erin McGathy and I went to a party, a rooftop party, that every year I\n\n10:36.880 --> 10:42.920\nthink Sarah Silverman has this rooftop party. And the stars come out in all their constellations.\n\n10:42.920 --> 10:53.720\nI met Chris Bosh and then I googled him and figured out who he was. I met Das Racist and I\n\n10:53.720 --> 10:59.440\ngoogled them and figured out who they were. I met Jack Black and he was like hey Das Racist is\n\n10:59.440 --> 11:08.000\nhere. I met Garry Shandling and talked to him for like eight minutes about television. He did\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:12.640\nall the talking which was fine. I never even told him that I had anything to do with TV. I wanted\n\n11:12.640 --> 11:19.160\nto hear Garry Shandling talk about TV. For you youngsters, I know you know Larry Sanders, the same\n\n11:19.160 --> 11:25.280\nway you know Mr. Show because you're the way I had to know Python. But do you know it's Gary\n\n11:25.280 --> 11:30.520\nShandling's show on Showtime? That's important to go buy the box set of. Maybe you don't have to\n\n11:30.520 --> 11:35.800\nsit through all of it. It's 1980s comedy. But the conceit of the concept was amazing, like Gary\n\n11:35.800 --> 11:43.160\nShandling was, has always been a pioneer of what, for lack of a better word, and I truly wish there\n\n11:43.160 --> 11:50.560\nwas no lack of a better word, meta entertainment. He's always been a defender of the creative's\n\n11:50.560 --> 11:59.480\nright to use the frame as part of the painting. And so he talked for a little bit about the thing.\n\n11:59.480 --> 12:08.600\nBut so as we were going into that party, we pulled up to the building, and we were walking in,\n\n12:08.600 --> 12:14.480\nand a guy said, are you here for Ms. Silverman's party? And we said yes. And he said, it's on the\n\n12:14.480 --> 12:19.880\nroof. Go on the elevators on the left and straight up. I don't know what accent that is, but I know\n\n12:19.880 --> 12:27.640\nhe had one. It was Turkistan. Turkistan. Then as we were opening the door, we just hear this voice.\n\n12:27.640 --> 12:36.360\nThis guy goes, the party's over. And I was like, oh, what? And looked over at the guy who said it,\n\n12:36.360 --> 12:44.200\nand it was just a guy sitting on a bench. And he was sitting with a woman that was, and I was like,\n\n12:44.200 --> 12:51.520\noh, whoa, whoa, what is it? And he immediately smiled and was like, I'm just kidding. And then we\n\n12:51.520 --> 12:58.240\nwent in and went in the elevator. And now in the elevator, I went, that guy's a fucking lame ass.\n\n12:58.240 --> 13:06.560\nOr certainly his joke was lame. And Aaron was like, well, now he's just trying to be a comrade,\n\n13:06.560 --> 13:12.560\nwhatever. He's as nervous as you are to be outside a party. He's trying to be funny, whatever. Good\n\n13:12.560 --> 13:21.680\nold Joan of Arc Aaron tied to the fucking stake of being cool to everybody. I hated him. I thought\n\n13:21.680 --> 13:26.960\nhe was a dick. Like, that's a dumb joke to make. If your joke is that you're a dick, that's a dick's\n\n13:26.960 --> 13:33.200\njoke. And maybe you may be pretending to be a dick, but that's what a dick does. If that's always your\n\n13:33.200 --> 13:40.320\njoke, I mean, that's often my joke. But so we go to the party. Like, I'm not up here to have a\n\n13:40.320 --> 13:48.800\nbreakthrough. I'm up here to be right. I'm up here to win an argument with my girlfriend, because I\n\n13:48.800 --> 13:56.800\nhave lights and a microphone on me. However, so we, we, if you were, if I go a little something, we\n\n13:56.800 --> 14:04.720\nleft the party. And then we go to the valet where our car is parked. And the valet takes my ticket.\n\n14:04.720 --> 14:11.440\nAnd he says, which car is yours? And I said, it's a silver Prius. And then as he's walking away,\n\n14:12.480 --> 14:18.800\nI, I, I go, well, that actually may be presumptuous. Call it a gray Prius.\n\n14:25.200 --> 14:30.640\nAnd, and Aaron, and Aaron proceeds to, she's like, see, you're as lame as that guy\n\n14:30.640 --> 14:39.920\noutside the party. And I was like, no, because my joke is that I'm lame. His joke is that we're\n\n14:39.920 --> 14:46.720\nlame. He's like taking high status. And I was taking low status. I was doing like a dumb joke.\n\n14:46.720 --> 14:52.800\nI'm just being funny and drunk. And that guy is like, he's saying that it was presumptuous is\n\n14:52.800 --> 14:59.920\ntaking low status. Well, yeah, but I was being ironic. I was being Garry Shandling about how,\n\n14:59.920 --> 15:03.760\nhow what I was saying, it's just was the guy on the bench, Garry Shandling. No.\n\n15:07.280 --> 15:14.400\nAnd then we got in a big fight. And how did that go? Well, it was her sticking up for a stranger\n\n15:14.400 --> 15:25.360\non a bench all night. And me going, no, my silver Prius joke was awesome. It was, it was funny.\n\n15:25.360 --> 15:35.280\nI don't want to overstep gray Prius. It's funny, you know,\n\n15:36.960 --> 15:39.120\nbecause silver is a color, but it also denotes value.\n\n15:40.400 --> 15:43.360\nAnd you, you saw that landed? Well, I didn't think it landed.\n\n15:46.880 --> 15:51.280\nI didn't think it landed. You saw that undid all the wrongs of the guy on the bench had to,\n\n15:51.280 --> 15:54.240\nwhy don't you change your name to Aaron? Because this is the conversation we had.\n\n15:54.240 --> 16:00.400\nBut as I was trying to explain to her, it's not my joke. Unlike the good party's over guy,\n\n16:00.400 --> 16:06.080\nmy joke doesn't have to land. I'm not holding anyone hostage with my joke. I'm talking to\n\n16:06.080 --> 16:12.080\nthe back of a valet's head. I don't care if he's deaf. It's still a funny joke to me. And,\n\n16:12.080 --> 16:15.200\nand it doesn't matter. It doesn't have to turn around and go, huh? And me go,\n\n16:15.200 --> 16:24.720\nI'm just kidding about my Prius. It becomes a call. This guy is the, that's comedic al-Qaeda to\n\n16:24.720 --> 16:32.880\ngo like, party's over. What? The party's over? No, it's not. Yeah, but I, I, six-year-old humor.\n\n16:32.880 --> 16:38.160\nI've known you long enough to know that when, when your shoe's untied, you can't even say it like,\n\n16:38.160 --> 16:43.600\nhey, Dan, we're going into a kind of a dirty restaurant, the floor is dirty. You might want\n\n16:43.600 --> 16:48.720\nto tie those shoes. Like, there's no way to say that to you without you taking offense. Nobody\n\n16:48.720 --> 16:55.040\never says you're going into a dirty restaurant. Everyone just goes, shoe's untied, bro. But I\n\n16:55.040 --> 17:02.800\ngo, hey, Dan, uh, fucking, uh, no, my shoes aren't untied. Party's over formula. No, I'm saying,\n\n17:02.800 --> 17:08.560\nif I say that, I don't think I'm trying to zin you. I think I'm saying like, uh, should that\n\n17:08.560 --> 17:13.040\nbe a concern to you? Maybe you don't notice that. I've learned now to never give two shits about\n\n17:13.040 --> 17:18.800\nyour shoe laces because I'm punished. I've learned to buy shoes without laces. This is a rare night\n\n17:18.800 --> 17:26.480\nfor me. I'm wearing a fine pair of Adidas. Yes, Adidas. As always, Harmontown brought to you\n\n17:26.480 --> 17:33.360\nby the good people at Adidas. Why give your foot a handshake when you can give it a hug? Yes,\n\n17:33.360 --> 17:44.480\nAdidas. The A is for after, uh, glow. Have sex with your foot by slipping a warm Adidas shoe on\n\n17:44.480 --> 17:52.000\nit. Nike. Do you think that this is ever going to pay off at Nike's going to really feel the\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:59.040\npressure? I can't, I can't stop now. What are we going to give up? Gentlemen, I've just seen a spike\n\n17:59.040 --> 18:02.720\nin sales over at Adidas and it can only be attributed to one thing. That's what we have to\n\n18:02.720 --> 18:08.400\nhope for. This aggressive guerrilla campaign over at Harmontown to strong arm us. Yeah. I say no\n\n18:08.400 --> 18:14.640\nway. I am the C, the chief financial officer. I say no. And then an old man gets in there,\n\n18:14.640 --> 18:20.560\ncomes in, and we're in a wheelchair and he goes, I think we're going about this all wrong, gentlemen.\n\n18:21.600 --> 18:29.200\nGive them whatever they want. I remember when you were a guerrilla, Richard. That's different,\n\n18:29.200 --> 18:36.880\nMr. Jenkins. I would like to think maybe four months time instead of this Harmontown poster\n\n18:36.880 --> 18:44.080\nback here, just a huge Nike swoosh back here. I'm telling you, yeah, hey, Nike, living well is\n\n18:44.080 --> 18:50.320\nthe best revenge. Fucking buy me out. And the next Harmontown can be about how much I love sucking\n\n18:50.320 --> 18:56.880\nNike's dick. I'll have no choice. You'll have me on the hook. I think the first step though is we\n\n18:56.880 --> 19:02.480\nactually have to, it has to become evident that we've made Adidas a dollar. Yeah, well, I believe\n\n19:02.480 --> 19:08.240\nthat will become evident. Don't worry about that, Jeff. Don't become one of them. Just be a creative\n\n19:08.240 --> 19:13.360\nand advertise for Adidas and let's see if we can reverse this. I'm not your valet guy. You can just\n\n19:13.360 --> 19:22.480\nyell shit at. So what was the, what was the outcome of the fight? Did you guys find any closure to\n\n19:22.480 --> 19:28.560\nthat? Relationship better than ever. Sealed it all up. All the holes are plugged. I don't know.\n\n19:30.640 --> 19:35.280\nWe agreed that we were both drunk and having an argument about a stupid thing. That's how it ended.\n\n19:36.400 --> 19:42.160\nDo you guys ever argue about important shit? Like, you know, like the Holocaust? Like six million\n\n19:42.160 --> 19:51.280\npeople. Come on, give me the remote. No, we never argue about important things. We're both narcissistic\n\n19:51.280 --> 19:55.120\nassholes. We don't care about the polar ice caps. We care about ourselves and each other.\n\n19:56.240 --> 20:02.240\nSo that's what we fight about. We fight because we worry that we don't love each other as much as\n\n20:02.240 --> 20:08.640\nthe other person loves us. Those are the good fights. The love fights. You know, eagles, they\n\n20:08.640 --> 20:21.680\nmake love in midair and they spiral to the floor. You're moved to words? What were you saying?\n\n20:21.680 --> 20:25.600\nHe got overcome. They're dying on the way down, you say?\n\n20:31.760 --> 20:36.720\nOh, so you like it. You like it. So you're saying the same thing the guy with the microphone is\n\n20:36.720 --> 20:49.520\nsaying. Just from the audience. Have you met pink hair? Don't have children. Some of us have\n\n20:49.520 --> 20:56.720\nworked to do. Yes, Adam. Now Adam's raising his hand. I got the guy in the back doing the Mars\n\n20:56.720 --> 21:01.840\ncallback. This is fucking, this is chaos. I accept it. Yes, Adam.\n\n21:01.840 --> 21:05.840\nJust saying if they have sex, they'll plummet to their deaths. If they have sex, they'll plummet to\n\n21:05.840 --> 21:14.560\ntheir deaths. Asperger's Adam connected the dots. We have a whole cavalcade of fucking peanuts here.\n\n21:14.560 --> 21:19.360\nThe only thing that happened is that sometimes people get so overcome by what you said. They're\n\n21:19.360 --> 21:28.880\nmoved to agree. They're moved to cry out. Maybe sometime your story's shoe is untied and they\n\n21:28.880 --> 21:34.800\nwant to call it to your attention. You take Umbridge. No. This is a tragic misunderstanding\n\n21:34.800 --> 21:40.720\nbecause he was saying the same thing I was, but when I hear somebody talking, he was just being\n\n21:40.720 --> 21:45.120\nsupportive. Now you really made him feel like a dick. You're saying that when people see your\n\n21:45.120 --> 21:49.920\nshoes untied, they're saying I love you. They're trying to help. They're worried about your shoe.\n\n21:49.920 --> 21:54.480\nI think that's their retroactive defense. I think if someone says, shoes untied, and you go, don't\n\n21:54.480 --> 22:03.280\ntell me what to do. Get out of my life. Tend your own garden, motherfucker. Back off. Then they go,\n\n22:05.200 --> 22:10.400\njust you could trip. Yeah, that was your first impulse. You walk around wondering when I'm\n\n22:10.400 --> 22:15.840\ngoing to trip. Some people do, man. Some people who go, shoes untied, bro. Not that guy. But I\n\n22:15.840 --> 22:19.280\ndon't say it like that. I say your fucking shoes untied. You've never told me my shoes untied.\n\n22:19.280 --> 22:25.120\nI have a liar. How about this? Two nights ago at a wedding, we're getting ready for a wedding,\n\n22:25.120 --> 22:30.160\nand Dan Harmon came down in a nice suit. You have a suit on. Looks good in it. Dan's lost some ways\n\n22:30.160 --> 22:35.840\nall fit. He looks like one of them. Thank you. Yeah. He looks great. But the motherfucker can't tie\n\n22:35.840 --> 22:43.040\na tie very well. You came down with a sloppy Harmon knot. And I thought, and boy, if you think\n\n22:43.040 --> 22:48.800\nyour shoes untied, I have more opinions about ties than shoes because the tie is right up there by\n\n22:48.800 --> 22:55.440\nyour face. And I was like, can we, let's work on that tie. And you're like, for some reason,\n\n22:55.440 --> 23:02.160\nthere was a giant, giant full length mirror from my fashion show for Aaron to Shade.\n\n23:03.280 --> 23:08.560\nAll right. Oh yeah. Call back. So there's a giant full length mirror down there. And I say, Dan,\n\n23:08.560 --> 23:12.080\nthen I would never do this because I know that you're not rewarded for telling Dan that anything\n\n23:12.080 --> 23:17.280\nis tied wrong. He has a thing about that. And so I go, we got to fix that tie. You're like,\n\n23:17.280 --> 23:22.400\nwhat's wrong with my tie? And I was like, it's just, I'm going to show you something. So I reach\n\n23:22.400 --> 23:27.440\naround and like, you know, grandpa before the wedding and I'm tying the tie and Aaron's taking\n\n23:27.440 --> 23:31.840\na picture of it. And you know, that's going to be Instagrammed in a moment. And you had the saddest\n\n23:31.840 --> 23:35.600\nlook on your face. The whole tag was so bummed. Because I know it's going to be Instagrammed.\n\n23:35.600 --> 23:39.280\nAnd it's like, I've been tied, I've been tied a tie since I was 12 years old. Would you tie it\n\n23:39.280 --> 23:43.920\nlike shit? No, I've got it down to a science. I do it very quickly. But it looks like, but it\n\n23:43.920 --> 23:50.880\nlooks, it looks bad. The difference between it looking bad and looking good is how much money\n\n23:50.880 --> 23:56.640\nand power I achieve. Okay, now we're, now we're getting someone. Yeah. If I, if I put a shoe on\n\n23:56.640 --> 24:02.400\nmy head, and I'm president, everyone has to put a shoe on their head. Well, we're monkeys. We're\n\n24:02.400 --> 24:14.000\nnot fucking giraffes. I'm just saying you look better with it. What's your prefigure giraffes? Well,\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:18.000\nthey have long necks. I mean, they're obviously they're willing to change for how high the leaf is.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:24.720\nI mean, I think because they had more neck, they'd be more concerned about ties.\n\n24:24.720 --> 24:32.880\nWhen did I become the crazy comic relief guy in my own show? Why am I the Jamie Farrer of this mash?\n\n24:36.480 --> 24:42.880\nThere was a show in the seventies. Can we get back on track, please? I try, I try to keep an\n\n24:42.880 --> 24:48.960\norderly show going here. I sometimes we get off on tangents. It's a rare thing, but normally this\n\n24:48.960 --> 24:53.920\nthing is a well oiled machine. Yeah, we pick a topic, we stick to it. Yeah. Tonight's topic is\n\n24:53.920 --> 24:57.680\ninfidelity. All right, I'm going to ask another question from the audience here, Dan. All right.\n\n24:57.680 --> 25:04.880\nSomebody writes, do you think anyone with a list of celebrities they're allowed to cheat on with\n\n25:04.880 --> 25:14.000\nhas ever been able to cross one off? I get distracted by the concept of that before because\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:19.920\nit felt like that whole hall pass, whatever you call it, celebrity pass thing. So douchey.\n\n25:19.920 --> 25:25.920\nSo, like, it really flies in the face of my whole, you know, like the idea that's like,\n\n25:27.200 --> 25:32.480\nwell, I'm, I'm fucking you, but we both agree Paris Hilton walked in, right?\n\n25:35.440 --> 25:40.560\nIt's so fucking disgusting. I wonder at divorce rate is 70%. I'm more concerned about the voice\n\n25:40.560 --> 25:47.040\nthat you give every other person in your life. Shoot and tap, bro. Everyone in the world is\n\n25:47.040 --> 25:52.720\njust alone. I don't know. They're all like, I go perceive them as trying to, well, you know,\n\n25:53.440 --> 25:58.720\nwho came up with that? All right, how about this? Is there a scenario where you're a\n\n25:58.720 --> 26:05.360\nsignificant other cheats that you totally forgive them for? Does that signal scenario exist for\n\n26:05.360 --> 26:19.520\nyou? Well, go big. Yeah. I mean, there's obvious, there's, I mean, there's top lines.\n\n26:19.520 --> 26:25.920\nShould we have ready for the room where anyone would, would, would cheat were like, if, okay,\n\n26:25.920 --> 26:36.720\nif there was a alien virus, no, no, no, Dan, I said, go big. There's an alien virus released on\n\n26:36.720 --> 26:42.640\nearth. And then like it dropped in like these orbs that created big explosions. So there was chaos.\n\n26:42.640 --> 26:47.440\nAnd then the virus got aerosol misted into the air. So the primary effect is the destruction\n\n26:47.440 --> 26:52.000\nof our infrastructure. And then while that would plunge us into chaos, which would separate me\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:58.640\nfrom my girlfriend, then the virus is released into the air, which threatens the survival of the\n\n26:58.640 --> 27:07.920\nhuman race. She meets a scientist, let's say played by Bill Pullman. While separated from me,\n\n27:07.920 --> 27:13.680\nshe's the only non sterilized human being in some bunker. He's the only non sterilized man.\n\n27:13.680 --> 27:18.880\nI mean, and for some reason, they can't just put his sperm in a cup and, you know, like they really\n\n27:18.880 --> 27:27.840\nhave to do it on the floor of the Library of Congress. Then the movie's over. We beat all the\n\n27:27.840 --> 27:32.800\naliens and I walk across the Salt Lake Flats toward her and she's got a cigar in her mouth.\n\n27:32.800 --> 27:39.840\nAnd, you know, we did it. We saved the earth. You know, she goes like, like, we did it. I'm like,\n\n27:39.840 --> 27:44.000\nwell, my God, I'm alive. You're alive. Oh, and she whispers in my ear, I had to fuck Bill Pullman.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:51.520\nAnd I go like, I would have too. I would have been okay with that. But anything really smaller\n\n27:51.520 --> 28:01.840\nscale than that, I'd be like, whore. You belong to me. I think that you might just have enough\n\n28:01.840 --> 28:05.920\npettiness in your body to still, like, three days later at Little Dom's having breakfast.\n\n28:07.840 --> 28:11.360\nThis crepe's really good. Yeah, does it remind you of Bill Pullman's dick?\n\n28:11.360 --> 28:17.440\nIs it better or worse? I'm just, I'm just, I'm making a scrapbook. Honey, honey,\n\n28:18.080 --> 28:22.320\nwe wouldn't have crepes anymore if I didn't fuck Bill Pullman. Yeah, no, no, I understood,\n\n28:22.320 --> 28:28.480\nunderstood. I'm sure you hated it. He was, he was, he was pretty good. He was pretty good.\n\n28:28.480 --> 28:38.080\nAnd thanks, baby. And then Paris Hilton walks in and that's my celebrity pass, which is the\n\n28:38.080 --> 28:48.320\nconceit of my new movies. Yeah, whatever, man. I don't know. I didn't want the theme to be\n\n28:48.320 --> 28:54.080\ninfidelity tonight because the topic makes, I don't like watching movies where the central conceit\n\n28:54.080 --> 29:01.680\nis like this scandalous taboo, like, like coming up with ways to make it okay for people to cheat.\n\n29:01.680 --> 29:06.160\nLike it always makes me very uncomfortable. I got cheated on once and I just, I have like a,\n\n29:06.160 --> 29:11.520\nI'm a very jealous person, very, very insecure, very possessive, very, very like,\n\n29:12.400 --> 29:19.200\nI don't, it just, I don't want to be better about it. I don't, because I don't, I don't want to\n\n29:19.200 --> 29:24.320\nhave like big thick calluses over the part of my body that feels pain when my girlfriend wants\n\n29:24.320 --> 29:30.480\nto fuck someone else. I want my girlfriend not to fuck other people. You know, I want, I want\n\n29:30.480 --> 29:37.520\ntrue love. I want, it does, it's, it, I guess it's immature, but I, yeah, it just, it bugs me.\n\n29:37.520 --> 29:43.520\nAs soon as we see these Richard Gehr movies and, and like, like, he, he, he trained parrots and\n\n29:43.520 --> 29:50.160\nhe was married, he was married to her in 1800s England, but then she went into a coma and then\n\n29:50.160 --> 29:57.360\nhe met the parrot owner of his dreams. She's in a coma, so he couldn't like break up with her. He\n\n29:57.360 --> 30:02.640\njust had to fuck her on top of her and it's like, you're supposed to tune in and you're really\n\n30:02.640 --> 30:07.920\njust jacking off to, to a man and woman fucking on top of his wife. How come you don't write more\n\n30:07.920 --> 30:20.320\nfeatures? Now, but Dan, you've, you said in previous podcasts or Harmontowns rather that\n\n30:21.120 --> 30:26.560\nwhen you are masturbating, you fantasize about your person, your, your, your girlfriend fucking\n\n30:26.560 --> 30:32.880\nsomebody else. Not my girlfriend necessarily. Like more often than not, it's, that's when I'm single\n\n30:32.880 --> 30:39.200\nbetween relationships, when I'm very lonely, when I'm masturbating, I, the, the fantasy that creeps\n\n30:39.200 --> 30:48.800\ninto my head the most often is my ex-girlfriend fucking other people. But never your current\n\n30:48.800 --> 30:53.280\ngirlfriend. What's up? But never your current girlfriend. Sometimes. Really? Sometimes my\n\n30:53.280 --> 30:59.840\ncurrent girlfriend, but, but like not, that's more in a like a, yeah, sometimes. You know, like,\n\n30:59.840 --> 31:04.960\nlike I'll think of like, like weird raunchy situations where my, my, the girlfriend that I'm\n\n31:04.960 --> 31:12.400\ncurrently with, you know, is an insatiable kind of animal that, that, that, that's, you know,\n\n31:12.400 --> 31:17.520\nand I'm not around. It starts with self-loathing because you're, you, yeah, like I said, you\n\n31:17.520 --> 31:22.880\ncan't, I can't put myself in a sexual situation very easily. Like it's easier the path of least\n\n31:22.880 --> 31:29.680\nresistances for me to not be there if it's really sexy. Because I look like Randy Quaid.\n\n31:31.120 --> 31:37.200\nAnd you don't, you don't cast him in nine and a half weeks. You, you put him in, in vacation three.\n\n31:38.960 --> 31:45.760\nAnd, and not even in the lead role. But, but, so, yeah, and that leads to like, well, if my,\n\n31:45.760 --> 31:50.240\nif my girlfriend is fucking and I'm not there, then who's she fucking? And then you go, oh,\n\n31:50.240 --> 31:56.720\nmaybe the guy's fixing the roof. I don't know. So sometimes, sometimes, but, but it's, that's like,\n\n31:56.720 --> 32:04.320\nyou know, 15, 20%. But when I'm, when I'm single and I've been dumped, especially like, like,\n\n32:04.320 --> 32:08.880\nit's like a hundred percent. Like I can't get my brain out of that, out of that gutter.\n\n32:10.560 --> 32:15.600\nLike where it's like, oh, my ex-girlfriend is that, that dumped me. She dumped me because\n\n32:15.600 --> 32:20.480\nshe's, she's doing this and she's doing that. And I'm thinking about that. So it's like, my sexual\n\n32:20.480 --> 32:27.200\nwires are crossed with my self-hatred wires. And it's, it's terrible. It's awful. It's a picture\n\n32:27.200 --> 32:37.840\nof mental illness. But saying it into a microphone makes it all better. Thanks to everything,\n\n32:37.840 --> 32:46.960\nperfect. Nothing will ever go wrong now. Thanks everybody tonight, by the way, for calling\n\n32:46.960 --> 32:54.000\nme out on everything. What the fuck? It's my show. I think you seem a little extra on edge\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:59.200\ntonight. No, I've, from the moment I came up here, I've been attacked. I know you've perceived\n\n32:59.200 --> 33:02.720\nattack. A guy in the front row was going like, yeah, like, I totally agree. And you thought,\n\n33:02.720 --> 33:07.360\nlike, you said, hey, shut the fuck up, man. Like, no, that's not true. Can we, can we, what's your\n\n33:07.360 --> 33:17.840\nname guy that looks exactly like a Kiva Schaefer? What's, what's your name? Levi? Well, don't do\n\n33:17.840 --> 33:21.280\ntoo much talking because when you're off mic, having heard the podcast recording thing, oh,\n\n33:21.280 --> 33:24.800\nhey, give him a mic, give him a mic. What was the thing, what was the thing you just called me?\n\n33:24.800 --> 33:29.440\nA guy that looks exactly like a Kiva Schaefer. A friend of ours, he's a writer and a very funny\n\n33:29.440 --> 33:37.920\nguy. Don't know what I'm 25. Should I know that? He's 22. Fuck you. Is he here tonight? Can I\n\n33:37.920 --> 33:43.760\nfight him? Fuck him. Like, should I know it? Don't see, he's defensive too. Because of you,\n\n33:43.760 --> 33:47.840\nthough. I, well, can we do it? Can we do a thing? Like, like, like, like, like,\n\n33:47.840 --> 33:52.640\nwould you just tell me, tell me about the first, tell me about, I'm trying to think of like an\n\n33:52.640 --> 34:03.280\neasy, like, tell me about your favorite Christmas. No. Okay. All right. You guys are meant for each\n\n34:03.280 --> 34:08.000\nother. All right. Well, tell me, tell me, what's your favorite, what's your favorite TV show? Or\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:12.560\njust a good one, just anyone doesn't have to be your favorite. Adam, shut up. Don't heckle, a\n\n34:12.560 --> 34:24.080\ndouble heckler. It's a fucking inception of... We get a double heckler. It's a biosphere's\n\n34:24.080 --> 34:28.720\nerupt, it's like a fractal fucking flower pattern of people. The hecklers are heckling the hecklers.\n\n34:30.240 --> 34:40.000\nI'm not heckling at all. No, no, no, no. Well, Levi, Adam, quiet. Levi, tell me about a favorite\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:44.800\nshow of yours. Strange of the Candy. Okay. Just tell me, tell me, start, start talking about why\n\n34:44.800 --> 34:58.880\nit's good. It's got Stephen Colbert. That's what you thought happens? Yeah. That's exactly what\n\n34:58.880 --> 35:04.000\nhappened. I was saying, I was saying eagle, eagle's fuck as they're going to the thing and I just,\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:12.480\nI just like, they're dying. Dan, I was sitting, I have the best seat in the house because I\n\n35:12.480 --> 35:19.200\ncan see you and Levi perfectly. And he was just like, fuck yeah, they're dying out there. It was\n\n35:19.200 --> 35:24.880\non your side. You had a comrade. Yes, we found out he was on my side, but I'm telling you,\n\n35:24.880 --> 35:30.400\nthe customer is always right. I'm a customer base of one. If the guy behind the microphone thinks\n\n35:30.400 --> 35:37.520\nthat someone is, is, is, is like a distraction. He's right. I'm right. I'm definitely right.\n\n35:38.880 --> 35:44.080\nYou're louder. So yeah, that's, that's how it works. Now he's got a microphone. No, it doesn't.\n\n35:44.960 --> 35:48.720\nNow we're on even ground. Yeah. No, here's the thing. Your name's going to my suicide note\n\n35:48.720 --> 35:53.920\ntonight, buddy. Like, no, you're fucked. So the audience doesn't, they don't like this. They don't\n\n35:53.920 --> 35:59.120\nlike the chaos. They don't like the, no, no, we, we, that's what's happening now. That's the thing.\n\n35:59.120 --> 36:04.800\nThat's the thing. All right. Levi, keep the microphone. Keep talking into it. No, no, no,\n\n36:04.800 --> 36:08.320\nno, because, because pink hair is about to grab the mic. I'm taking that away. I mean,\n\n36:08.320 --> 36:14.720\nit rolls downhill. There's chaos and there's chaos. This has nothing to do with power dynamics. It\n\n36:14.720 --> 36:20.320\nhas everything to do with intent and emotion and dynamics. What I'm saying is not that I'm\n\n36:20.320 --> 36:24.720\nlouder than you or that you're being too loud. What I'm saying is that your way of expressing\n\n36:24.720 --> 36:30.400\nagreement to me with these lights in my face looks an awful lot like a drowning man.\n\n36:32.320 --> 36:37.760\nEveryone else does that. What they just did. You were, you went, he's saying I wouldn't do it.\n\n36:40.320 --> 36:46.000\nAnd I thought it meant that your mother had been raped by an eagle. And I wanted to talk\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:49.440\nabout it, by the way. I didn't just point at your shirt and go, where'd you get it? Ray\n\n36:49.440 --> 36:55.360\nCharles at a garage sale. Go fuck yourself, faggot. I didn't do anything. I didn't bully you. I\n\n36:55.360 --> 37:00.480\nsaid, what's going on down here? The same way I did to that fucking asshole outside Sarah Silverman's\n\n37:00.480 --> 37:08.000\nparty. What do you mean party's over? How fuck you, my shoes untied. You got my full attention now.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:15.040\nMy brain's the size of a fucking planet. How much of it do you want? You want all of it?\n\n37:15.040 --> 37:23.120\nI'll give you all of it. You're not going to like it. I'm thinking about a new TV show.\n\n37:23.840 --> 37:29.120\nIt's going to make everyone happy. Party's over. Eagles are dying. Your shoes untied.\n\n37:29.120 --> 37:34.320\nIs it about aliens that drop pods of things? That was good. Remember when I came up with?\n\n37:35.760 --> 37:39.040\nHey, go, what, think about your girlfriend's second dicks? Will Bill Pullman's in it? That's\n\n37:39.040 --> 37:48.080\na fucking box office dynamite. You see what's going on up here? I deserve space. I'll reward\n\n37:48.080 --> 37:58.480\nyou for having it. I have Aspergers. Do you think so? No, I diagnosed myself with it after taking\n\n37:58.480 --> 38:09.680\nan online quiz and reading some conversations in a forum. Was one of the symptoms you take online\n\n38:09.680 --> 38:17.840\nAspergers quizzes? Yeah, yeah. I don't have an excuse. I'm a bad person. I'm a bad,\n\n38:17.840 --> 38:21.920\nunlikable person. Would you be happier if you found out that you did have some sort of diagnosable\n\n38:21.920 --> 38:28.960\nillness like Aspergers? Well, like Aaron said, I'd rather it be one that's named after me. I'd\n\n38:28.960 --> 38:35.120\nrather not have this Asperger guy on my shit. Like that guy, Narcissus. Yeah, exactly. I'd\n\n38:35.120 --> 38:45.920\nlike to have people after me call themselves Harmon Burgers. As if the word burger is part of the...\n\n38:47.280 --> 38:51.200\nI don't know. Well, you guys are throwing me. Congratulations. I mean, that's what you get.\n\n38:51.200 --> 38:56.560\nYou cracked the walnut. Now you get the chewy, neurotic nut in the middle.\n\n38:57.200 --> 39:04.000\nWell, we have to bring fucking Spencer up here. We have a real treat in store tonight.\n\n39:04.960 --> 39:10.880\nMy applause. How many of you have never heard of or know nothing about Dungeons and Dragons? My\n\n39:10.880 --> 39:20.880\napplause. I heard Silas start laughing, but then there was... Sorry, go ahead. Anybody who knows\n\n39:20.880 --> 39:26.960\nnothing about Dungeons and Dragons? I'm one of those people. All right, so several, like six or seven\n\n39:26.960 --> 39:34.160\nor eight. Yeah. But I was just laughing because I'm just very proud of my audience. Yes. We are\n\n39:34.160 --> 39:41.680\nindeed in the back room of a comic book store right now. And three Harmontowns ago, Dan brought\n\n39:41.680 --> 39:47.280\nup the idea of possibly having a dungeon master so we could play Dungeons and Dragons. And there\n\n39:47.280 --> 39:50.960\nwas a gentleman in our audience that night who could not have possibly known that we were going\n\n39:50.960 --> 39:56.480\nto talk about that, who shot his hand in the air. So then last week, we brought him up again and we\n\n39:56.480 --> 40:01.680\ncame up with characters. Jeff decided that he wanted to be a gnome barbarian. Correct.\n\n40:01.680 --> 40:07.200\nI was trying to go out of character. The audience picked the name of Quark.\n\n40:08.480 --> 40:14.640\nYeah. That hat kind of fell down around my ears, but I'm sticking with it. I'm Quark.\n\n40:15.920 --> 40:21.760\nAnd you and your audience picked the name Sharpie Buttsalot for me.\n\n40:23.120 --> 40:28.720\nWe can change them. We can change those names. We shot from the hip. That's not good storytelling\n\n40:28.720 --> 40:34.960\nwhen you go back and change. Would I be happier with a name that wasn't Quark? Yes. The answer is\n\n40:34.960 --> 40:42.960\nyes. More importantly, you picked a gnome barbarian and I picked a human magic user.\n\n40:43.840 --> 40:49.120\nI'm first edition Dungeons and Dragons, so Spencer had to email me subsequently and go,\n\n40:49.120 --> 40:52.800\noh, by the way, it's not just magic user. You have to pick between a wizard and a sorcerer.\n\n40:52.800 --> 40:56.720\nI picked wizard. Wizard is somebody who studies it. Adam, what are you doing?\n\n40:56.720 --> 41:01.040\nI was imagining how it wasn't going to correct you because in first part,\n\n41:01.040 --> 41:07.920\nedition gnomes can't be more varied. I think if the show, if Nike ever does give us any money,\n\n41:08.880 --> 41:11.360\nI want everyone in this audience to have a lavalier mic on.\n\n41:12.960 --> 41:17.200\nAnd the world's biggest soundboard. Yeah. There definitely needs to be, yeah,\n\n41:17.200 --> 41:20.240\nthere's like roving drones that can just like mic people.\n\n41:21.360 --> 41:24.960\nSome of them nerd mail, we need to area mic this audience more because there's too much\n\n41:24.960 --> 41:28.720\ngood shit happening. Adam, how could you not think I heard you?\n\n41:29.360 --> 41:35.200\nYou're not watching Breaking Bad. I'm two feet from you. He's talking to...\n\n41:35.200 --> 41:43.760\nHe was trying to help Dan. Oh, you're sticking up for just a fundamental vagrant.\n\n41:44.960 --> 41:49.280\nI don't know much about being a barbarian dwarf, but I'm pretty sure he would stand up for this\n\n41:49.280 --> 41:53.040\nguy. All right. Well, now, obviously, since we're arguing about Dungeons and Dragons,\n\n41:53.040 --> 42:00.400\nwhich is ratings dynamite. Let's bring the star of this Walker, Texas Ranger show up. Spencer,\n\n42:00.400 --> 42:18.320\ncome on up here. How's it going? Thank you for coming back, Spencer, and thank you in advance\n\n42:18.320 --> 42:24.560\nfor the work you've done since Friday. Do we have to start with this? Did you hear what was\n\n42:24.560 --> 42:28.720\ngoing on down here? Have you met Adam, by the way? Yeah. No, I haven't.\n\n42:33.360 --> 42:38.720\nNo, I... Was that insincere to you? I'm genuinely enthused. There's a huge...\n\n42:39.920 --> 42:43.200\nIs there a weird force field up here where everybody feels like people are coming after him?\n\n42:43.200 --> 42:49.840\nNo, there's just a lot of people coming after the people on stage. Spencer and I are good\n\n42:49.840 --> 42:54.640\npeople and on the same side, right? Forever. They broke the fourth wall good and early this night.\n\n42:55.920 --> 42:59.680\nAll right. But no, seriously. So Adam started immediately talking about some kind of...\n\n43:04.160 --> 43:08.160\nThe wonderful voice amplification. Jeff just did a bit where he tried to raise the microphone\n\n43:08.160 --> 43:14.880\nat Spencer's level. Spencer's six foot four. I'm tired of that. How tall are you? We're going\n\n43:14.880 --> 43:19.520\nwith six foot four, I think. You tell me, bro, I stopped measuring myself.\n\n43:23.120 --> 43:28.320\nThere is a huge insecurity thing going on with that microphone. There's a weird... That's the\n\n43:28.320 --> 43:33.760\nmost secure thing in the world. Fuck rulers. All right. I'm tall. That's all you need to know.\n\n43:33.760 --> 43:38.080\nYeah. At a certain point, you stop caring. Yeah. Okay. I got you. I like this guy. Just don't give me\n\n43:38.080 --> 43:46.880\nthat look when you say it. I'm sorry. I don't know, man. So for real, I just... Because really,\n\n43:46.880 --> 43:52.560\nAdam, what were you saying? What was your thing about... What were you saying? Gnomes, barbarians,\n\n43:52.560 --> 43:59.120\nwhat were you saying? I'm sorry. I was holding... Touching the microphone, which you're now holding\n\n43:59.120 --> 44:04.160\nand dispensing. But in the first edition... I know I've seen your D&D rule books. I thought their first\n\n44:04.160 --> 44:08.480\nedition and gnomes can't be barbarians. But I thought, if I say that out loud, Dan's going to think\n\n44:08.480 --> 44:15.760\nI'm more asperging than I think he is, Am. See, that's what the sentence is that proves itself.\n\n44:15.760 --> 44:20.160\nSo I was like, I'm just going to say that quietly to someone who might get it in context. And I\n\n44:20.160 --> 44:24.320\nstill upset you for which I apologize. All right. Okay. Well, all right.\n\n44:24.320 --> 44:31.200\nI didn't have to check. Did you... He was saying... Is there...\n\n44:31.200 --> 44:34.400\nYeah, he has a fair point. He was talking about first edition. Is that correct? Yeah,\n\n44:34.400 --> 44:38.160\nwe're playing 3.5 editions, so it's not an issue. But yeah, he is right.\n\n44:41.120 --> 44:45.120\nI don't know what the fuck anybody's talking about. Well, I don't either...\n\n44:45.120 --> 44:47.840\nLet me just explain it for a long time. Here we go.\n\n44:47.840 --> 44:56.880\nThis is getting off in the right foot. Let's call our edition 3.6,\n\n44:56.880 --> 45:01.600\nwhich means that if there's an infraction, you don't have to yell out. That's the\n\n45:01.600 --> 45:09.760\ndifference between 3.5 and 3.6. All right. So if I say my wizard's wearing a pointy hat,\n\n45:09.760 --> 45:17.920\nyou know, and you read in Elf Magazine that he can't... Just, you know, don't run up on stage.\n\n45:17.920 --> 45:24.000\nIt's getting scary in this place. I'm doing great. It's good. It's just like Fort Apache the Bronx\n\n45:25.200 --> 45:32.960\nor Assault on Precinct 17. Yeah. Take it away, Spencer. All right. Well, as we've mentioned,\n\n45:32.960 --> 45:41.040\nyou've picked a gnome barbarian, Jeff. Oh, Adam's already here. I'm a gnome barbarian.\n\n45:41.040 --> 45:46.960\nAll right. Is that not good? No, it's great. It's fine. I don't really know... Briefly\n\n45:46.960 --> 45:53.120\nexplain to me what that means. A gnome is about... Your gnome is about 3 foot, 3 inches tall,\n\n45:54.080 --> 46:00.560\nand he angrily... That's what she said. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. It's like a kickstand, I swear.\n\n46:00.560 --> 46:07.440\nBut, and he flies angrily at people with a sword a full foot longer than he is.\n\n46:08.080 --> 46:17.440\nNo shit? Yeah. All right. We're back in business. Sorry. I'm 3 foot 3. I got a 4 foot 3 sword.\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:21.440\nIt's slanted. That's what she said.\n\n46:26.560 --> 46:29.200\nShould I stop saying that's what she said? It's not going to happen a lot.\n\n46:29.200 --> 46:32.240\nI think that happens 8 times per game and judges a dragon, so...\n\n46:33.440 --> 46:40.720\nAll right. Okay, so I fly angrily at people with a sword a foot longer than my body.\n\n46:40.720 --> 46:46.720\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I wrote you a backstory. Do you want to hear your backstory?\n\n46:46.720 --> 46:51.680\nFucking yes. All right. Well, let me just start it off. Quark...\n\n46:53.680 --> 46:58.800\nstands tall for a gnome a full 3 foot 3 inches. When he was growing up, he was picked on by the\n\n46:58.800 --> 47:03.520\nlocal hooligans who insulted his ragged clothes and admittedly lackluster mental faculties on a\n\n47:03.520 --> 47:11.600\nregular basis. That is until one day he snapped in a gnomon gnome scuffle, biting the ear off the\n\n47:11.600 --> 47:20.240\nringleader of the local gang, the cactus bunch, after they had taken his prized bandana. It was\n\n47:20.240 --> 47:30.240\nhis first taste of blood. It would not be his last. All right. I love that. I love that a lot.\n\n47:31.120 --> 47:34.080\nAs much as I hate gnome on gnome violence, I still...\n\n47:36.160 --> 47:39.920\nIt's an epidemic. Where will it stop? But that's hopefully at the Grammys.\n\n47:41.920 --> 47:46.800\nThe thing is, as you said that Spencer, I have a perfect visual image of who that character is.\n\n47:46.800 --> 47:52.400\nAll right, great. And so, yeah, he hits stuff with a sword. That's about it, you know.\n\n47:53.360 --> 47:56.080\nYeah, well, we'll get there. Yeah, no, he gets better.\n\n47:56.080 --> 48:01.200\nIs there still, as of 3.5, is it just a list of those attributes, like strength,\n\n48:01.200 --> 48:04.880\nintelligence, wisdom, all that stuff? Yeah, there's the class features. Mostly,\n\n48:04.880 --> 48:08.400\nit's attributes, feats, and skills. But yeah, there's some stuff.\n\n48:08.400 --> 48:11.600\nI thought maybe you just read down Jeff's attributes, just the main ones.\n\n48:11.600 --> 48:17.600\nOh, yeah, yeah, no problem. He's got strength, 16. Out of how many?\n\n48:19.120 --> 48:23.600\nTan is considered average, like 18 is like the pinnacle of human achievement.\n\n48:25.440 --> 48:30.160\nLike giant monsters. 16 is well above average. You'd be like a bodybuilder.\n\n48:30.160 --> 48:31.200\nThank you. In the real world.\n\n48:31.200 --> 48:42.720\nDexterity is 14, which is above average, but not like super amazing. Constitution is 17,\n\n48:42.720 --> 48:47.200\nwhich is really strong. That's a, you know, he can take a beating and keep on eating.\n\n48:47.200 --> 48:50.720\nAlso, he can, and he can drink people under the table.\n\n48:51.600 --> 48:58.080\nYou got that right. He's got a 12 intelligence, which is still kind of smart for someone who's\n\n48:58.080 --> 49:02.480\na barbarian, but he's got 11 wisdom, which means he has no common sense.\n\n49:03.840 --> 49:08.160\nI gave him a 17 charisma because he's got a dashing smile and a winning sense of humor.\n\n49:09.440 --> 49:10.880\nThat's not you. That's just the character.\n\n49:14.880 --> 49:17.360\nYou're the boss, Spencer. Thank you very much.\n\n49:17.360 --> 49:19.680\nAll right. Moving on to Sharpie Buttsalot.\n\n49:21.680 --> 49:22.160\nAll right.\n\n49:22.160 --> 49:28.800\nSharpie Buttsalot is a tall, dark-haired wizard and what is unmistakably a periwinkle\n\n49:28.800 --> 49:36.400\nterrycloth bathrobe. Sharpie was born to a maiden doomed to life imprisonment in the\n\n49:36.400 --> 49:41.040\nhigh tower of penitence. Life was hard growing up in a prison, but he started to read and learn\n\n49:41.040 --> 49:46.880\nmagic at a young age. He eventually cast featherfall on himself and fell safely out of the tower and\n\n49:46.880 --> 49:53.040\nbegan adventuring. Yeah. All right. First level. That's as far as your story goes. We just started.\n\n49:53.040 --> 49:58.320\nYou start to build the legend now. And believe me, the name Sharpie Buttsalot will be feared\n\n49:58.320 --> 50:03.280\nthroughout the realm. What about my attributes? What do I got here?\n\n50:03.280 --> 50:09.120\nAll right. You got a nine strength, which is still decent for your average layperson.\n\n50:09.120 --> 50:13.200\nI couldn't do a pull-up in grade school. You might still be able to. Yeah.\n\n50:13.200 --> 50:20.480\nYeah. A 14 dexterity, which is the same as Jeff's. What's his shoe tying ability?\n\n50:22.160 --> 50:27.760\nHe's got three rinks and a shoe tying. All right. Don't team up with him, Spencer. Don't\n\n50:27.760 --> 50:31.680\nbreak my heart. I can't help it. I will never ask you to team up with me, but don't team up with him.\n\n50:33.200 --> 50:40.000\nI'll try. 16 Constitution, which is a little, is still really strong. You can take some hits\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:43.680\nand drink a lot also. You can take some hits and eat some shits.\n\n50:47.920 --> 50:50.160\nThat's my first time, man. That's my first time.\n\n50:52.240 --> 50:57.520\nI'm just trying to have a good time over here. I'm a barbarian gnome.\n\n50:59.040 --> 51:08.480\nWe have a weird sense of humor, man. All right. You got a 15 wisdom, which means you're reasonably\n\n51:08.480 --> 51:14.560\nwise and you have a cool head on your shoulders. Oh, I missed 18 intelligence. Sorry about that.\n\n51:14.560 --> 51:17.040\nThat's your main stat. You're really smart. Yeah.\n\n51:21.200 --> 51:27.840\nTypecasting. These were rolled randomly. These are random rolls. Yeah, kind of. Yeah.\n\n51:28.480 --> 51:33.040\nLike, I rolled them randomly and then assigned them to the stats that fit the classes. So like,\n\n51:33.040 --> 51:37.440\nhe didn't have an 18 strength and not be able to cast any spells yet. That's normal. That's normal.\n\n51:37.440 --> 51:40.880\nThat's just good dungeon master stuff. Well, it's good character creation. Yeah, exactly.\n\n51:42.080 --> 51:47.520\nAnd 11 charisma, which is above average, but you're not going to be winning any beauty contests.\n\n51:47.520 --> 51:55.760\nYou're no Bill Pullman. I'll have to rely on my ability of storytelling to keep my woman at home.\n\n51:55.760 --> 52:01.520\nYeah. You got a crossbow and some spells. You can shrink people down and make things light up.\n\n52:01.520 --> 52:05.280\nI can shoot a crossbow? Yeah, you got a crossbow because sometimes you run out of spells and\n\n52:05.280 --> 52:10.480\ndon't want to die. Oh, that's nice. All right. Well, is there anything else you need to add,\n\n52:10.480 --> 52:13.840\nSpencer? Do you want to talk about how we proceed now that we have our characters?\n\n52:14.480 --> 52:19.520\nYeah. I mean, basically, should we try to play a 15 minute adventure next to Harmontown? What do\n\n52:19.520 --> 52:27.920\nyou say, audience? Yeah. Well, they're not going to boo. We'll find out if there's a good idea\n\n52:27.920 --> 52:32.720\nor a bad one. But maybe we should... No, I said we kick this off. Next time in town, we get\n\n52:32.720 --> 52:38.160\nSharpie and Quark meet in the field of battle. And so what do you need to do that? Should we\n\n52:38.160 --> 52:42.800\nnext time... Should we put a little table over there so that you have a place to roll dice?\n\n52:42.800 --> 52:47.760\nYeah. Just roll dice and maps and things. I don't need that many maps, but yeah, dice.\n\n52:47.760 --> 52:53.200\nAll right. Okay. So we'll give... I think so we give that a shot at the next Harmontown and see\n\n52:53.200 --> 53:08.880\nhow it goes from there. All right. Thank you, Spencer. That's a lot of work Spencer's putting in\n\n53:08.880 --> 53:13.760\nfor us. It's nice of him. I think we got the right man for the job though. I think so. He's\n\n53:13.760 --> 53:28.000\nlovable, isn't he? Yeah. He approaches his job with sincerity. I did an interview today, a small\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:32.800\none with a guy from Time Magazine, which I think most of the time when they say you're doing an\n\n53:32.800 --> 53:38.800\ninterview for time, I think they actually just mean and they're applauding the arrival of the\n\n53:38.800 --> 53:44.240\nvodka. I did an interview with a guy on the phone just about the Anomalysa Kickstarter.\n\n53:46.240 --> 53:50.800\nWhy don't you explain that briefly for people that don't know? Go donate. If the time's not\n\n53:50.800 --> 53:56.160\nup yet, go to Kickstarter. Look for Anomalysa. It's a Charlie Kaufman script that we're producing\n\n53:56.160 --> 54:00.480\nthrough our studio Starburns. It's going to be a stop motion feature written by Charlie Kaufman.\n\n54:00.480 --> 54:05.120\nYou can go kick in some money and we'll make it as good as we can, as well as we can. See,\n\n54:05.120 --> 54:12.560\nwe'll do a grammar check if you give us enough money. The guy that interviewed me from Time,\n\n54:13.840 --> 54:18.960\nhis name was Harry McCracken. And that's it. That's the end of that story.\n\n54:19.920 --> 54:23.680\nFor real? I wrote that in my... Is it a nom de plume or that's his name?\n\n54:23.680 --> 54:29.600\nI don't know. Phil's brother? You know. You worked for him? This is actual name.\n\n54:29.600 --> 54:33.280\nHe's right for PC World. Harry McCracken.\n\n54:35.280 --> 54:40.320\nI didn't mean to talk. No, no, no. God damn it. I didn't mean to become Ming the Merciless.\n\n54:43.600 --> 54:47.520\nA guy from the audience just said, I worked for Harry McCracken and that's his real name.\n\n54:47.520 --> 54:51.920\nYou know what I think happened? I think Spencer came up here and dispelled some of the evil magic\n\n54:51.920 --> 54:56.320\nthat was up on that stage. Well, I can't wait to listen to the recording of tonight and see who\n\n54:56.320 --> 55:02.400\nwent wrong where. But I did not feel like I came up here with any negative energy. I guess I said\n\n55:02.400 --> 55:08.800\nthe first thing I said is, hey, pink hair, you're going to make trouble. I blame pink hair.\n\n55:09.360 --> 55:13.040\nThat's what it is. You came out and blamed pink hair, but she hadn't even done anything as far as I\n\n55:13.040 --> 55:17.520\nhad seen. Thank you. Thank you. Did something go wrong in the line? Did you meet her earlier?\n\n55:17.520 --> 55:22.640\nNo, it didn't go wrong. I was being sincere. My first thought, because I saw the pink hair,\n\n55:22.640 --> 55:28.400\nand then I thought, trouble. Because in the line, she was excited. You were excited.\n\n55:29.680 --> 55:36.400\nI know. You don't have to. I know why. No, it's not true. Because it can be... Well, look what\n\n55:36.400 --> 55:41.360\nhappened. I guess the story we're learning, the ironic Greek myth is that I thought it would be\n\n55:41.360 --> 55:44.640\ntrouble. I tried to prevent the trouble. I caused all the trouble. Is that what we're learning?\n\n55:44.640 --> 55:53.760\nI caused the trouble. Yes, so I caused the trouble. Geez. Take it to the bank. It's\n\n55:53.760 --> 55:59.040\nthe last check you're going to get. It's the last time I'm ever going to be wrong about anything.\n\n56:00.080 --> 56:04.960\nPromise you that. Sometimes at Harbin Town, I have to lay down the law.\n\n56:04.960 --> 56:16.000\nAll right. What else is on the docket? Let's do some more infidelity questions, apparently.\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:25.440\nHow about now? Here's a goodie. Somebody in the audience writes, I am a gay male. I recently\n\n56:25.440 --> 56:30.960\nstopped seeing a guy because he insisted on a, quote, open relationship. He insisted that it\n\n56:30.960 --> 56:37.600\nwould only be physical and not emotional. Is a, quote, physically open relationship possible or\n\n56:37.600 --> 56:44.400\nany kind for that matter? Boy, that's a lot of spaghetti. That's... If I'm getting him right,\n\n56:45.040 --> 56:51.120\nhe's saying that his partner said, let's be in an open relationship. But he insisted it would only\n\n56:51.120 --> 56:56.000\nbe physical and not emotional. Well, by it, he means what? The new relationship? The new relationship\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:59.200\nwould only be a physical. I'm only going to fuck another guy. I'm not going to fall in love with\n\n56:59.200 --> 57:01.200\nanother guy. I'm not going to love another guy. I'm just going to fuck another guy. I'm just going\n\n57:01.200 --> 57:06.800\nto filate him frequently. Well, and that's it. But yeah, well, wait. And so his final question is,\n\n57:06.800 --> 57:12.800\nis that possible? Is there such a thing as a physically open relationship? I don't think so.\n\n57:12.800 --> 57:18.800\nAnd I don't think the rules are probably any different for our gay friends, our fine feathered\n\n57:18.800 --> 57:33.840\ngay friends. I picture them as like a hawk species in a dive. Second wave. That guy was gay. The\n\n57:33.840 --> 57:39.120\nactor that played the leader of the Hawkman in Flash Gordon. Brian Blessed, whom I love. Yeah,\n\n57:39.120 --> 57:43.600\nhe was a big burly gay dude who was awesome as the leader of the Hawkman. Gay is a French\n\n57:43.600 --> 57:49.040\nword. That's why I said our fine feathered gay friends. I was picturing like a battalion of\n\n57:49.040 --> 57:53.840\nwhen I said our gay friends, I just pictured looking at a portal in a spaceship and seeing\n\n57:53.840 --> 58:03.920\nlike a fleet of hawk people that were there to save the day. I'm sure it's the same for\n\n58:03.920 --> 58:07.440\neverybody. I can't tell if that's diminishing gay people or really exalting them. Well,\n\n58:07.440 --> 58:14.480\nit's up to them. I don't know. Up to them in the hawks. When the hawks have sex in the air,\n\n58:14.480 --> 58:23.120\nthough, man, they die. Don't get Levi fucking hysterical to a point where I think he's heckling\n\n58:23.120 --> 58:35.200\nme. Just stop it. Pink hair. God damn it. Pink hair and Levi. It's like having a bundle of\n\n58:35.200 --> 58:41.440\ndynamite in the front row. It's not my fault. Sweating nitroglycerin. It's like you shake it\n\n58:41.440 --> 58:54.320\nand it blows up. Okay. Gay people, hear my voice. Sex comes easier for you because men are pigs\n\n58:54.320 --> 58:59.760\nand gay men couples are easier to hook up and stuff. But I think that's the only difference.\n\n58:59.760 --> 59:03.680\nI imagine that everyone that goes to bed together no matter what they're doing\n\n59:03.680 --> 59:08.800\nis cosmically intermingling a little bit. There's an emotional component to all sex. Otherwise,\n\n59:08.800 --> 59:13.680\nall we'd all do is jerk off. If you've got the same energy from an orgasm no matter what you\n\n59:13.680 --> 59:20.720\nwere doing, it doesn't matter what promises you make. So as much as this poor gentleman probably\n\n59:20.720 --> 59:26.560\ndoesn't need or want to hear it, his mate that's saying, can I be in an open room? I'm agreeing\n\n59:26.560 --> 59:32.320\nwith his obvious anxiety, which is, no, there's no such thing as a physical. You can't love\n\n59:32.320 --> 59:37.360\none guy and then be physical with another guy and never the twain shall meet.\n\n59:37.360 --> 59:40.480\nSeveral people, I went through the questions that people wrote down in the audience.\n\n59:42.640 --> 59:50.240\nSurprisingly, almost word for word people asked, and several of you asked, what's worse,\n\n59:51.040 --> 59:57.600\nphysically cheating or emotionally cheating? That was on everybody's minds. What would be\n\n59:57.600 --> 01:00:03.120\nmore hurtful? I'm way too old fashioned to. I think that there are people who are better equipped\n\n01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:10.560\nfor this because I don't think my advice would be or my insights would be as valid. I've often\n\n01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:15.680\nobserved that people who are growing up at an age of text messaging and Facebooking and all this\n\n01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:22.320\nstuff, they are a little more shielded in the right places. I'm a 39-year-old maniac. When I\n\n01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:29.600\nhave a girlfriend, I get nervous and jealous very easily. I think that that's sort of intertwined\n\n01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:35.680\nwith the definition of loving somebody. It doesn't make any logical sense, though. It's not practical.\n\n01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.480\nSo I'm not Dr. Phil about when it comes to when you should be jealous and possessive.\n\n01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:44.160\nThere's a million people out there, some of them might be in the audience, who are actually capable\n\n01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:49.920\nof doing weird, swingery stuff and totally keeping everything together. Bruce Willis and\n\n01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.480\nAshton Kutcher and Demi Moore, whoever the fuck they all, you see a tablet, they're all in a boat\n\n01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.360\ntogether, like, hey, we all fucked each other. Who cares? Let's go fishing. It is possible for\n\n01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:05.680\npeople to be mature. I was staying in a hotel one time. I was supposed to fly out in the morning,\n\n01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:10.640\nbut for some reason the flight got canceled, so I had to stay in Reno, Nevada for a night,\n\n01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:15.600\nand we stayed at one of the casinos there, one of the big hotel casinos there. And I don't know\n\n01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:21.120\nif you've ever been to Reno. It's a little mini country cowboy Vegas, the biggest little city\n\n01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:27.360\nin the world, I think they call it. And are you from there? No. Keep it down, man. No, sir.\n\n01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:37.040\nBut we stayed at this casino, and I was walking to my hotel room, and there's me and some of the\n\n01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:42.960\nguys I got a comedy show with, and we're walking to our hotel room, and kind of like 80% of the\n\n01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:48.960\ndoorways, like the hotel doors, there was a polaroid of like a couple, like a married couple,\n\n01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:54.320\nor a guy in a gal, sometimes just a guy, sometimes just a gal, but there's a polaroid taped to the\n\n01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:59.120\ndoors, and I don't really think anything of it. I thought it was some thing on convention. So then\n\n01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:05.040\nI go down to the casino, and I'm playing roulette, and I'm sitting there, and I notice like everyone's\n\n01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:13.600\ngot these really, really visible, bright, like hot pink or orange wristbands on. Not everybody,\n\n01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:18.400\nbut a lot of people, but also the same kind of age group and style of the people that were in these\n\n01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:24.560\nphotos on the doors in the hotel. And so I say to the, to the, the croupier, what do you call the\n\n01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:30.320\nguy at the roulette table? I said, what's going on? I go, what's the wristbands and the polaroids\n\n01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:39.040\nin the door? And he goes, this fingers convention. I was like, oh, no. I was looking around, I hate\n\n01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:46.480\nto be a jerk, but you wouldn't fuck any one of these people. It was pretty rough. It was pretty\n\n01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.800\nrough. And I said, what's up with the polaroids in the door? And the polaroids are like, if you\n\n01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.520\nlike, if you see, you walk by a door and you go, oh, that's who's in this room, and you can knock on\n\n01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.360\nthe door. And if they want you to come in, you can either join in or watch or whatever. I mean,\n\n01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.840\nI guess that's, that's all fun and fine and dandy. But I got to say that the mood in that casino was\n\n01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:10.000\ntense because nobody got what they fucking wanted or paid for. Or yeah, it was, it was rough. And\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.240\nthere was a couple like, there were a couple of couples that were more on the sexy scale, like on\n\n01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:19.280\nthe sexy side of the scale. And they were just being worked on by everybody and they were really\n\n01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:24.000\nbummed out. And it was, it was bad. Yeah. I, I, in a world where we haven't answered those questions\n\n01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.120\nyet, I just keep it simple and just go with what my primal instinct tells me, which is that I want,\n\n01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:34.160\nI want a woman and I want her to be my woman. And if that's unhealthy, it's the unhealthy choice\n\n01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:40.160\nthat will get me through a sea of very confusing shit. Because, because it's, every, every, every\n\n01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.160\nperson I've ever talked to, every anecdote I've ever heard about three ways and four ways and nine\n\n01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.720\nways and open relationships and she's my old lady, but we have a common law thing. And when we do\n\n01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:56.720\nthis and that guy lives in her garage and he hangs in a back costume and none of those end with\n\n01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:05.120\nanyone cutting a cake, which I'm sorry. It's, I'm my parent's son. I just want to go. I just want\n\n01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:11.040\nto do the chicken dance and go home and have some kids and like die. And I want to do it with one\n\n01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:19.440\nperson and I don't want Kevin, you know, hanging out or Natalie. I don't, those stories end with\n\n01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:25.680\nprobably no more. I think those people, like we owe it to them to say, like, I think that people\n\n01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:31.120\nwho are pursuing their bliss, like they, those people are just as right as, as monogamists.\n\n01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.920\nI think it's random and cosmic. It's like, it's, there's stress everywhere. It's fucking stressful.\n\n01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:44.400\nYou don't, there's no such thing as waking up every morning with a big hard on for, for the\n\n01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:49.440\nperson that's three feet from you and, and, and, and being happy and then going to bed happy and\n\n01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:54.800\ndoing it every day. Because then if that happens, then that, that's not, human beings aren't happy\n\n01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:59.200\nall the time. Happiness is defined by the unhappiness that follows it. So there is no, like, you\n\n01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:05.040\ntalk, I always smell a rat when I talk to people who are like, yeah, we do, you know, we cheated\n\n01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:09.600\nthe system. We got to, you know, it's like, this is Darla. She's with me, but, you know, we go home\n\n01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:15.360\ntogether. We live together, but, you know, I do what I want with Stacy. And I always feel like\n\n01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.520\nsomeone's going to kill themselves, you know, pretty soon. Stacy's going to murder somebody\n\n01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:26.400\nor something's uncomfortable in bed. But if I'm wrong or if I'm right, I, I, I, there's no time\n\n01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:32.400\nfor me to change that fact. I'm all for kids sticking to the, the addiction, the gum that's\n\n01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:36.880\nunder the desk that you touch when it's there. It's like, you want a girlfriend, you want your\n\n01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:40.160\ngirlfriend to turn into your wife, you want your wife to turn into the mother of your children,\n\n01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:48.960\nyou want to, and infidelity is, is a, is the static that happens on that TV reception because\n\n01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:55.280\npeople fuck up, they fail, and they, they, we all, like, we fantasize and like, think that we\n\n01:05:55.280 --> 01:06:00.080\ndid something wrong or something, and we fail as human beings, infidelity happens. And I don't,\n\n01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:05.600\nI don't know if it's a solution to say, hey, my television station is half static. I think you're\n\n01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:10.560\njust, you're saying, you're still saying the same thing. You're saying it's hard to be in a\n\n01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:15.520\nrelationship. And so your solution is to, is to make relationships hard. Well, somebody asked,\n\n01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:19.600\nwould you rather be the person that was cheated on or the person that cheated?\n\n01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:26.160\nI would, I would definitely rather be cheated on. I, I, as much as, that, wow, that is a really\n\n01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:32.560\nawesome question. That's, that's, that's a question of perspective, because it's certainly in the\n\n01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:39.520\nlong run, you would definitely rather be cheated on, because, um, fucking, like, you get to stop\n\n01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:50.560\nbeing in a relationship and you're the hero. You get flooded with pity puss.\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.400\nShould you want it? Pity puss. Uh, yeah, it's, it's like, you don't even have to force it in\n\n01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.920\nconversation. It's going to come up naturally. Why'd you play that song on the jig box? My wife\n\n01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:14.880\nfucked someone. She, what? I would never do that. Prove it. Make love to my penis tonight forever.\n\n01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:22.800\nProve you're not like my wife. Uh, you just, like, you don't, you don't, you don't break a sweat,\n\n01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:29.120\nyou sleep like a baby, you're, and, and, and you're not married. Yeah, better to be in the long run,\n\n01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:33.440\nbecause you were in an unhealthy relationship if someone's capable of cheating on you.\n\n01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:38.080\nThe problem is, if you're, it's like, like, the idea of you, you, you were in love with her,\n\n01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:42.720\nand you can't live without her, and she cheated on you. That, that, so in the short term, I,\n\n01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:48.960\npeople jump off bridges, people jump, uh, that was an unfortunate choice of words. Tony, Tony Scott\n\n01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.760\njust jumped off a bridge, uh, RIP, Tony Scott, whatever, tell whatever. It doesn't, it's not\n\n01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:58.800\na disrespect to him to use the phrase jump up a bridge. It's just unfortunate. It was just that\n\n01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:04.400\nwe were talking about it earlier. People, people jump off of spaceships, uh, because of relationships,\n\n01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:08.320\nbecause of, because of people leaving them, because, because when you, that was Ridley Scott.\n\n01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:19.680\nWhen you are, yeah, let's just get it. Fuck those guys. I just, I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan.\n\n01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.800\nKidding, sorry. Everyone's a fan of everybody who's dead. Fuck you, fuck you, Phyllis Diller,\n\n01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:29.760\nyou piece of shit. I'm kidding. I work here, Phyllis Diller, and I love Tony and Ridley Scott.\n\n01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:36.320\nRon Polillo, you owe me money. Nice way out. Ron Polillo died. Horshack. Horshack. Horshack.\n\n01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:42.400\nWelcome back, Carter, died as well. Welcome to our death segment of Harmontown. Uh, it's not.\n\n01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:46.960\nThis show's got it all. We got infidelity. We got judges and dragons. We got dead people. We have\n\n01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.440\na, a, a complete imbalance between the power and the power dynamic of audience and performer.\n\n01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:55.600\nLevi fucked off about 10 minutes ago. We don't know where he went. He's gone.\n\n01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.800\nHe's jumping off a bridge right now.\n\n01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.400\nHe's, he's suffocating himself in a giant pair of acid wash pants.\n\n01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:12.960\nIt's Levi. It's just because his name, his name is, his name is a kind of pants.\n\n01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:15.920\nI'm not going to repeat it.\n\n01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:22.800\nPlease, when he comes back. I, I admire the, uh, the, the calm and comfort you have.\n\n01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:27.360\nI'm from Milwaukee. What? I thought you were from Las Vegas.\n\n01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:31.040\nI live here, but I'm from Milwaukee. I am, as well.\n\n01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:38.800\nShe just called Dan an asshole now. This is unpod, the back and forth is unpod castable\n\n01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.400\nbecause no one can hear you and we don't dare give you a microphone.\n\n01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:46.800\nAll right. No, no. Give it, give it to her. Give it to her.\n\n01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:54.800\nJesus Christ. I walked toward her with a microphone and the crowd, uh, a mutiny.\n\n01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.760\nBut I'm just, I'm not, I'm not, there's nothing wrong with you as a human being. I'm not, I'm\n\n01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:08.400\nnot saying, I, okay. I just admire her zeal and her comfort of, of just completely shoehorning\n\n01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.560\nherself into the show. I think it's fantastic. But as we established, okay, we got to the bottom\n\n01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:16.800\nof it. I stepped up on stage. I drew first blood. I immediately all of a sudden, I shouldn't have\n\n01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:22.240\ndone that. I shook that can. I was doing a callback. I thought, oh, there was energy out there in the\n\n01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:26.560\nline. I think I'll do a big callback. I don't know what I was thinking. I'm an idiot. I'm not,\n\n01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.760\nI'm, this isn't my job. This isn't, I don't write on my tax form. I don't go show runner.\n\n01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:40.400\nWait. Yes, I do. I'm not anymore, but it's a live show runner. I don't say this as a town with my\n\n01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:46.560\nname on it. What the fuck were we talking about? Well, what were we just talking about? It was\n\n01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:53.760\nimportant. No, we weren't talking about Levi jumping off bridges. I mean, we were, but we\n\n01:10:53.760 --> 01:11:00.160\nshouldn't have been infidelity. Yeah. People broken out or whatever. I, I, I, yes, I would,\n\n01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:05.600\nI would rather be cheated on because the long-term, all right. Here's a short question. Woody Allen\n\n01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:15.440\nthoughts. I do have thoughts because Aaron just pulled up that documentary on Woody Allen. It was\n\n01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.880\na, how many people have by applause have seen that Woody Allen documentary? That was very\n\n01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:29.200\ninteresting watching that. The most so revelatory, like Woody Allen is a ubiquitous genius. Like\n\n01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:34.400\nhe's, but he's, but everyone in this room has grown up surrounded by his movies because he\n\n01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:40.880\nmakes almost literally one per year and has been doing it for how many decades. And some of them\n\n01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:46.880\nhit and some of them miss, but he's, he's made more good movies than, than, than any of his peers\n\n01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.480\nbecause he's made kind of by more bad movies. I never got that, that perspective on him.\n\n01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:56.640\nAnd there's this, like the studying of his personality by talking to all of the people\n\n01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:05.040\naround him. He seems to have like, uh, I was relieved to find out that he really, he, there's\n\n01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:09.920\nlike, uh, his circuit board and his brain is kind of like, there's a couple of like, uh,\n\n01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:15.520\nscorch marks there that, that were, which is, which is nice because it means that we don't all\n\n01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.880\nowe it to ourselves to go home and try to be Woody Allen. Like, because he, it's clearly like,\n\n01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.600\nI think it's genetic. I think it's like neurological. He does that. He was, there's like,\n\n01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:31.440\nwhat, what was the movie that he was writing in the documentary? He was writing one of his\n\n01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:37.360\ngood movies while all of the shit was going down in the tabloids about him, uh, and Sun Yi.\n\n01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.240\nDoes anyone, can anyone shout it out to them? Who's writing husband's wives? That was it. Wait,\n\n01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:47.200\nwas that a good one or not? Was it Broadway, Danny Rose or husband's wives? No, couldn't have been\n\n01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:52.160\nBroadway, Danny Rose. Those are both good movies. I don't think it was Bullets over Broadway either.\n\n01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:59.280\nIt's husband's wives probably. Curly Sue. Curly Sue. This is a story about him like taking phone\n\n01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:04.080\ncalls with his lawyer and going like, you know, you might want to get a blood sample. Um, and then\n\n01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.560\ncoming back and sitting down and just riffing bits to do this trick. And the end result is a fine\n\n01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.560\nmovie that everyone enjoyed. Like he, he, and then they have that montage of everyone going,\n\n01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.200\nhe compartmentalizes, he compartmentalizes, he compartmentalizes. Like he, the, the, another\n\n01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:23.520\nword for compartmentalizing is like, uh, you know, autism. He's, he is like, like there's\n\n01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.080\ndifferent parts of his brain that are incapable of crossing into other parts of his brain. And\n\n01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:33.920\nhe's one of those rare people that like, like those compartments are shaped in a Tetris block\n\n01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:39.680\nthat makes like movies. And he just, just keeps making them and making like good ones and good\n\n01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:44.720\nones and good ones. To me, it was a relief because I'm a narcissist and everyone who does\n\n01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:49.120\nanything creative, I don't care if you make a rocking chair or a stained glass window. I'm,\n\n01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:56.640\nmy big thought in my head is like, do I need to prove that I can do that better or worse? Or,\n\n01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.840\nyou know, like, like, is that, am I under threat here? Do I need to go, what do I,\n\n01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:04.000\nyou beat your wife, right? That's why you make such good stained glass windows. I don't know.\n\n01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.600\nLike I'm always, I'm always looking for some way to make myself feel at ease that I am\n\n01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:16.000\nstill a contributor to my society, that what I do is important and, and that I'm doing it right\n\n01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.240\nand that I don't need to work harder at it or less hard at it. And watching that documentary\n\n01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:26.160\nreally relaxed me because Woody Allen has haunted me a long time because I always think like, Jesus\n\n01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:31.760\nChrist, how do you do what he does? Well, you said to me recently that there might be some\n\n01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.000\nmoney coming in on syndication. And if you ever got that money coming in that you would stop writing,\n\n01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.840\nyou said this before that you might retire, you would never work again, you would just do that,\n\n01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:43.360\nbut I don't, I don't imagine that you would be able to do that. No, I don't think I would.\n\n01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.440\nYeah. So you say that, but you're, that's,\n\n01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.480\nWell, I say that, yeah, I say that because I feel like I'm, yeah, I'm trying to win some game against\n\n01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.680\npeople that I hate. Like I, I don't want to be rich and I won't care, but I'll always care. I was\n\n01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:03.600\nlike, yeah, I'll die like writing the worst shit that I've ever written. I'll always, I'm all fucked\n\n01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:12.080\nup. Like, don't say aw. If they're gonna say aw, that's when they should say it. I will, I will,\n\n01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:19.920\nlike, yeah, I will like, I will be 70 years old if I'm lucky. And I'll like, I'll just be working\n\n01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:26.480\non some fucking piece of garbage. Like I'll just be trying to prove that I'm trying to untie some\n\n01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.880\nknot in my head of like, how you're supposed to make yourself happy. I just talked to Mitch\n\n01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:37.200\nHurwitz about this name drop. I was on the set of Arrested Development and met Mitch Hurwitz.\n\n01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:45.680\nAnd, and he said so many things that I had been thinking, which it was so, such a great thing\n\n01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:51.600\nto hear him say it. And one of the things that we talked about was the fact that when we make things,\n\n01:15:53.760 --> 01:16:00.080\nwe're trying to entertain everyone in the world. We're not ever, ever, ever trying to exclude\n\n01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:05.360\nanybody. And the, but the, but the only way you could possibly ever stand a chance of entertaining\n\n01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:10.880\neverybody is if you're entertaining yourself. There's no, otherwise you're a hack. You don't,\n\n01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:17.520\nyou don't say, well, people like got milk. That's a funny joke. So if you say got milk,\n\n01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.360\nthen everyone will laugh. That's what I've learned. And you're not laughing the whole time. It's like,\n\n01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:25.120\nit's garbage. It's hackery. And it works for some people because they get lucky,\n\n01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:28.720\nbecause there's only so much shit to watch out there. But the truth is, if you really want\n\n01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:33.040\nto make people happy, you have to know who you are and what you want and express it and make\n\n01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:38.160\nyourself laugh if you're doing comedy. And then it's your tough luck if only three million people\n\n01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:43.600\nlike it, as opposed to 18 million people. It's, it's, it's Mitch, Mitch Hurwitz was exactly the\n\n01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.920\nsame as me going like, I wish, I wish everybody liked everything that I did. I really do. But\n\n01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:52.880\nI'm not going to, I'm not going to change what he does because then what do we be doing? He'd be\n\n01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:57.200\nwriting like an animated penguin movie. He doesn't, what would he, it would be, it would be terrible.\n\n01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:01.680\nIt would be worse than an animated penguin movie that you like. Like there's one that you like,\n\n01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:05.840\nand it was written by a guy who was operating the top of his game. He woke up with a boner for\n\n01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:11.520\nanimated penguins. Mitch Hurwitz would be slumming it and then like betraying you. You'd be watching\n\n01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:20.240\na liar lie. And so he has to do what he has to do at the top of his RPMs and just like be bummed out.\n\n01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:25.840\nWhat were we talking about? Infidelity? Yeah. Woody Allen. Oh, Woody Allen. Yes, Woody Allen.\n\n01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:30.320\nYeah. So whatever. It relaxed me a lot to watch that documentary. Those were my thoughts. I had a\n\n01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:34.240\nlot of thoughts. Aaron and I talked about Woody Allen for a long time. Aaron's observation was\n\n01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:40.880\nlike, yeah, it's like, he's a jazz musician on top of all this. Like he has this weird disconnection\n\n01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.040\nwhere he's able to focus on people and he doesn't, he doesn't work with the actors. He just casts\n\n01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:48.960\npeople like they're crayons in a crayon box. He doesn't even talk to them. And then he sends them\n\n01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:54.640\na script and says, you can do, do, do the lines the way I wrote them or don't. And if anyone\n\n01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.560\nelse said that, they'd be full of shit. You know, they'd be just saying that because he really\n\n01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:02.000\nmeans it. He doesn't give a fuck if you do the script or not. He's Woody Allen and he doesn't\n\n01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.200\ncare if you do his script. And then he gets the actor, he's on the set and he's, he described it\n\n01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:12.560\nas like, he's like, the people do the take, you know, and you, you know, you say cut and then\n\n01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:17.760\nthey look at you like, you know, did I do a good job? And of course you can't stare at them all\n\n01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:23.440\nday. So you have to say something. So you say, that was fine. It's like, that's a person talking\n\n01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:28.960\nthat's like, people are mannequins to him. They are, they're like, like, he's just playing a video\n\n01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:33.680\ngame where, where everyone is like an obstacle to get past so that he can do what he wants to do.\n\n01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:39.360\nHe's just playing Grand Theft Auto. And his goal is to, is to make the most movies ever,\n\n01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:43.360\nwhich is, which is great. You can emulate yourself. But you, but you, like the relieving\n\n01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:48.320\nthing is that no, his brain is shaped different. You can't, you got to do what you want to do.\n\n01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:51.600\nHe's doing what he wants to do. What's the difference of the shape of your brain that\n\n01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:59.520\nmakes you do what you do well? Mind shape like a planet. And it has beautiful clouds. I don't know.\n\n01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:04.320\nWhat would be your crowning achievement? Or is there such a thing as something you want?\n\n01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.360\nLike, would you like, you know, best screenplay or something like that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Best\n\n01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:14.400\noriginal screenplay of Oscar. That would be, if I got that, then I would, it would be hard to get\n\n01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:22.080\nup the next day. I would probably play a lot of Minecraft after I got, I would, I would be like,\n\n01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:27.760\nokay, what am I, you know, like, let's go on a hike. Yeah. If can I hike my way to another one\n\n01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:34.400\nof these motherfuckers? How about more chocolate pudding? Will you, but will you endeavor to do\n\n01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:38.160\nthat? What do you, do you think? Yeah, I want to, I want to. There was times that, you know,\n\n01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:43.440\nDan and I were friends and you know, like, like years ago when he was broke or I was broke and\n\n01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:46.640\nwe're both helping each other out and stuff like that. And like, and you have these scripted ideas,\n\n01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.640\nlike, and it was times when you, you seemed like more of a feature writer than a TV writer.\n\n01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.680\nThat's why I came out here. I didn't even know you could write TV. Like most of us,\n\n01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:58.480\nI thought the people on TV were making it up. You just kind of felt that when you watch TV.\n\n01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:04.560\nLike, oh, Ellen, all those hilarious in the Korean War. He should do more stuff. He's great.\n\n01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:08.320\nJerry Seinfeld's like, whoa, what a great observation about, about socks.\n\n01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:14.480\nWhy didn't they think of putting him with Kramer for a long time ago? You just,\n\n01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:19.680\nyeah, I have that feeling about TV. It doesn't feel like it's written if it's good. And yeah,\n\n01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:24.560\nI never, the TV I fell into on accident. I wanted to write movies. I wanted, before that,\n\n01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:30.800\nI wanted to write books. I always wanted to be legit. Don't quote me, man, because I had said,\n\n01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:41.040\nshit, easy, look him up. Died of AIDS, jumped off the bridge of AIDS. And you know,\n\n01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:48.880\nPhyllis Diller, whom I love, she died today, right? And she was 95 and she died in her sleep. And a\n\n01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:53.520\nwhoever found her, like, was one of her children. So someone came into the house and found her\n\n01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:57.600\nand she had a smile on her face. Oh, come on. And I was like, that's, that's how you fucking do it.\n\n01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:03.440\nWhy can't we all, why can't we all live to between 70 and 90 and just turn to dust?\n\n01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:10.400\nWhy does it always have to be like, like, his heart did this and his liver did that and his lung\n\n01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:16.720\nhad this thing. And then he had a complicated thing. And it's a waste. I met Phyllis Diller after\n\n01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:23.840\na show at the improv. I like, I think she was 89. And she put down in my presence four pretty big\n\n01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:29.600\nbeef eater, gin martinis. And she was just solid as a rock. And also I was on stage for a while.\n\n01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:34.240\nSo she probably, she might have had a couple in there. And she had diamond the size of like,\n\n01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:38.880\nlike a billiard ball. Apparently that was worth like just a zillion dollars. And she,\n\n01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:43.840\nshe's quite wealthy. She done very well for us off. And she was one of the first female comedians\n\n01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:48.160\nthat like made it like possible for women. And she was just like this, this beautiful,\n\n01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:51.600\nand she made her whole career about being ugly, but she really wasn't. She was really beautiful.\n\n01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:57.840\nShe was very pretty. And she was 37 years old when she started. She had five kids or something\n\n01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:02.400\nlike that. She was a housewife. And she was 37 years old when she started her career. And she\n\n01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:08.480\ndied a beloved, amazing person at 95 years old with a fucking smile on her face. It made me so\n\n01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:12.720\nhappy and also wistful and sad all day long. I think I put me in a very strange mood today.\n\n01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:16.960\nI was like, you couldn't do it any better than that. I don't think. Well, Tony Scott put me in a\n\n01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:21.920\nstrange mood. I'm not going to, I'm not going to blab. Obviously my relationship with pink hair\n\n01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:26.880\nis what really set things off. But I had Tony's, the Tony Scott thing put me in a bad mood because\n\n01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:32.320\nit reminded me of spaulding gray. It reminded me a hundred Thompson. I don't like suicides. It made\n\n01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.800\nme very uncomfortable because I feel like I'm a very weak person. And I feel like if I get sick,\n\n01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:41.120\nand it's rumored that I'm, you look for reasons with this stuff. I want to know why did Tony\n\n01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:45.280\nScott do this? I heard the rumor that he had terminal brain cancer. I don't know if that's\n\n01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:52.240\nstill a rumor. Does anybody out there know? Still a rumor. But that makes me very uncomfortable\n\n01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:58.960\nbecause it just, it feels too close to home. It feels too close to some hypothetical home.\n\n01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:06.640\nI feel like I wouldn't have the strength to endure hardship. I don't, I have a told on Friday the\n\n01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:13.440\nstory of me calling an ambulance because I had too much coffee. And I was miserable. I was like,\n\n01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:18.000\nI'm a pretty, I'm a pretty cut off your nose despite your face guy. I'm a pretty like,\n\n01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:24.000\nfuck you if you don't want me. And I, you know, if a guy makes a joke about the party being over,\n\n01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:29.040\nyou know, yeah, I might, I might just, just to teach him a lesson, just blow my brains out.\n\n01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:36.720\nThat's a joke. If you get diagnosed with a terminal illness, just to walk around with that,\n\n01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:43.680\npick your time, pick your time. Hey, can I get a loan? I just want to get a loan at this bank.\n\n01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:51.840\nWell, you know, got milk. Just to, just to, just to teach one person an invaluable lesson.\n\n01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:56.160\nShoes untied, bro. Oh, really? Well, then fuck it.\n\n01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:03.440\nThank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody. You guys have been wonderful as always.\n\n01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:14.720\nOh, shit.
