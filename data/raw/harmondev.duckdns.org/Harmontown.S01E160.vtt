{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:29.000\nLet's bring out our Game Master, Mrs. Benster, Clayton Didgeridoo.\n\n00:29.000 --> 00:47.000\nOh, yeah. And the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:51.000\nThank you very much. That's very kind.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:57.000\nBoy, Spencer and I almost didn't make it because we're starting at like $7.59. It's amazing.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:03.000\nI made one comment in the green room yesterday because we were starting to load in at like $8.15.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:09.000\nIt was like, you know, that always happens. It's things gradually slip. People show up later, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:15.000\nAnd I made one comment about it. Somebody cracked the fucking whip. I think it was Dustin.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:16.000\nDusty trails.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:22.000\nI didn't want it to happen. I didn't want the whip to crack. I wanted the whip to gently like a jump rope.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:29.000\nI wanted to go to $8.14 and then $8.13 because I was taking a shit.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:34.000\nNow I got what the kids call a turtle head.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:42.000\nIt's not true. The kids don't call it that. I do. And it's not true also. I took a huge shit at home before I came here.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:52.000\nOkay, so speaking of positive changes, just for the asking. So last week we got our scoop, our ice scoop.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:58.000\nBut then you may have noticed. So Bobcat Goldthwaite's up here and he's talking about child molestation.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:01.000\nAnd I'm using the ice scoops like...\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:07.000\nIt's very awkward and it's like, but I'll be damned if I'm going to not drink.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:15.000\nAre there little chicken feet? They look like little chicken feet.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:25.000\nNot only are these tongs, which is better than a scoop, but the one drawback that a tong would have under a scoop would be the tongs you don't trust them.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:33.000\nBut even if just psychologically, the idea that these are chicken feet tongs, like I tested it backstage, it's amazing.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:39.000\nI mean, you can blindly reach in and you'll come out with at least one cube. And it's not going anywhere.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:47.000\nAnd it's quiet. It's child molestation conversation compatible to the year 2030.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:54.000\nAnd we got that. So to give credit where credit is due, we just got that, you know, from Brandon.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nI don't know if he wants his whole name said.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:57.000\nSure.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:04.000\nBrandon Lee, chill coat. Chill coat. Hello, Brandon here. I enjoy Harmontown and I've heard your plea for clean ice.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:12.000\nI think he sent this before, you know, it raced and lost the scoop, but it beat the scoop.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:22.000\nMy girlfriend, Risa, and I hope to make it out to a show one day. You don't know her. She's in Niagara Falls.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:27.000\nSo please take this as a token of appreciation for less dirty and gross beverages.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:28.000\nLove it.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:32.000\nThank you, Brandon.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:39.000\nWhat else do we, if we could just ask, you know, let's positively visualize, like, what do we, let's clean this, our act up.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:40.000\nLike, what do we want?\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:44.000\nI got a very civilized gift from a guy named Nick Gill who sent this from the UK.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:47.000\nHe's a playwright and author from London, I think London.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:55.000\nAnd he's written an adaptation of The Trial by Kafka and the first character in it, Comptroller.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:57.000\nDid you know it's pronounced controller?\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:58.000\nIt's pronounced controller.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:01.000\nBecause we actually have one at Starburn Studios now.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:02.000\nYou do?\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:04.000\nYeah, we have, it's like a real word in a real thing.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:05.000\nFucking kick his ass, dude.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nYeah, well.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nIs it sex or there might be a girl?\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:14.000\nOkay, so it could be a girl. Girls can be controllers.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:16.000\nBut I feel like they pronounce it right.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:18.000\nWhy would you say, why would you spell it Comptroller?\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:19.000\nYou're going to call it controller.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:20.000\nIt irritates me.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:21.000\nI still have never looked it up.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:22.000\nI don't know what the word means.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:23.000\nAll right.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:31.000\nSo, so, well, for, okay, let's just speed, speed through the current events.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:35.000\nOf course, a lot of people, for better or for worse, Jeff, get their news from this show.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:39.000\nI think, I think it's, I think it's for better.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:40.000\nI think it's for better.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:43.000\nSo the Pokemon shootings were averted.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:48.000\nUh, there was a, there was a, there was a big Pokemon conference and the, and there were\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:49.000\ntwo guys now.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:50.000\nWell, old champions.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:54.000\nStop, stop, stop me when I'm wrong if you know what I'm wrong about the details.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:55.000\nAll right.\n\n04:55.000 --> 05:00.000\nBut that there were two, two people who tweeted that they were going to tweeted a threat.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:03.000\nThere's social media warnings about these gentlemen.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:06.000\nOh, social, oh, people on social media were warning about them because maybe they were\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:07.000\nmaking creepy comments or something.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:08.000\nSomething along those lines.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:13.000\nAt any rate, these guys got stopped before going into the convention and they searched\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:17.000\ntheir car and they had like fucking assault rifles and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:18.000\nYeah.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nThere's a assault rifle and, and a shotgun.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:25.000\nSo there, I mean, unless there's more to it, and you know, I had spent five, five seconds\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:27.000\nreading about it, but it appears to be a giant massacre.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nThey were going to, they were going to blast up the Pokemon.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:30.000\nYeah.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:32.000\nThe world championships, Jeff.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:40.000\nAnd the, the scary thing about the, the article isn't the photo of the weapons in question\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:41.000\nto me.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:43.000\nThat's because they just look like pictures of weapons.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:48.000\nThe scary thing to me is the photo of the, whether it's this year's or not, but just\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nthe photo of what a Pokemon conference looks like.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nNo, and I don't, I'm not teasing.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:55.000\nI'm saying like it's a room.\n\n05:55.000 --> 06:01.000\nIt's, it's, it's packed, you know, and it's just, it's the world championships.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:05.000\nIt's, it's, it would, it's, it's very.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nSo there's regional Pokemon things that you climb your way up to make.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:14.000\nI mean, you don't just start at the world championships.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:15.000\nThere's regionals.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:19.000\nHe got to be eight gym leaders.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nThat might actually be true.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:23.000\nSo I've never, I've never played Pokemon.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nIs it like a card kind of game?\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.000\nWell, I mean, I didn't dig too deeply.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nThere is a card game that I believe.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nYeah, that's still popular.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nAnd there's, you know, the video game that people play against.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:34.000\nI bought, I bought.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:35.000\nThere you go.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:36.000\nThanks.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:37.000\nThat's Steve Levy.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:39.000\nI bought, oh, is he here?\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nHe's in a research department, Steve.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:42.000\nHe loves Pokemon.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:47.000\nI bought, I bought a Nintendo thing, the DS thing in New York because I, and I wanted\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:50.000\nto get into Pokemon because it seems like, because you got to catch them all.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:51.000\nYeah.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nFrom what I understand.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:57.000\nAnd that, that appeals to my, when I, you know, I like the hoarding and the, you know,\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:00.000\nlike I thought if you improve them and trade them and have them fight each other,\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:03.000\nit's not like from what I've heard about Pokemon for 25 years.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\nIt sounds like a very unsafe thing to get into now.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:07.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:08.000\nYeah.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:11.000\nOr it's, or the most safe ever now for the time being.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:15.000\nBut the scary thing about it was what a, what a murder spree friendly environment.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:18.000\nLike, I mean, I just, I just, yeah.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:19.000\nWhat's that?\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:20.000\nIt's cock fighting for children.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nOh, well, the game is cock fighting for children.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:23.000\nYes.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:26.000\nBut I had moved back to the much more severe topic of those children getting shot in\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:27.000\nthe face.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nSo, all right.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:34.000\nSo the Pokemon shootings were averted, which makes it okay to now go back to police bashing\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:37.000\nbecause they really did their job there.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:41.000\nObviously law enforcement at work at the Pokemon conference.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:47.000\nLaw enforcement a little less at work at LAX where Wiz Khalifa was handcuffed and slammed\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:48.000\nto the floor.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:49.000\nHe wasn't resisting.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:50.000\nHe wasn't.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:55.000\nWell, then why did they say, why did they keep saying stop resisting?\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:59.000\nWhy would police say that while kneeling on your back if you weren't, if they couldn't\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:02.000\ntell, like a chiropractor can that you're, there's resistance going on.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:05.000\nThey can tell their knees are right on his shoulder blades.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:06.000\nThey know if there's resistance there.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nYou got me there.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:11.000\nBut this guy's, I didn't realize, I was like, who's Wiz Khalifa?\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nAnd I was all excited because listen to his name.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nIt's like, it's more than just a rapper.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.000\nIt's like, wow, I'm into a guy named Wiz Khalifa.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:21.000\nLike, like he's super, super duper not white.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:24.000\nLike, like, like, like, he's covered in tattoos.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:29.000\nAnd he's, and he's, and he's the, were you, were you watching that twins show with us\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:32.000\non VH1, that, that, that, that twin reality show thing?\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:36.000\nAnyways, the fact that the two white fat twins, the, the funniest thing was that they won\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:39.000\nby, by, because their song was Weed'em Boys.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:40.000\nAnd that's, that's Wiz Khalifa.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nI didn't, I didn't connect those dots.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:46.000\nWeed'em Boys and the, and the song from Fast Furious.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:54.000\nWhen you put in your baboon here and you put on your face and it's good to have seen you\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nbut I'll see you again.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:59.000\nYo, yo, yo, it seems I'm back in the day.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:03.000\nIt seems I'm back in the times and all the usual ways from, from around in the,\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.000\njust one of those heartfelt kind of back in the day raps.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:10.000\nIt doesn't have to be as good a rap.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nI was, I was getting that vibe from that.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:17.000\nI always wanted, I always wanted to do, it's like the quintessential one of those, but those come out every year.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nIt started off with kind of like a Michael McDonald kind of, kind of Dubid,\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:21.000\nDubid brothers kind of thing.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:22.000\nYeah.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nCan you, can you, can you do one?\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nCan you, can you sing with your dulcet tones?\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:30.000\nAnd then so that I can do a back in the day, like rap?\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:33.000\nSo what's, what's, what's, what do I have to accomplish with my part of it?\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nYou have to do like the hook.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:38.000\nYou have to be like the, you have to, you have to do like a, you have to say like,\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:43.000\nI love your face and I love your chicken too.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:44.000\nLike, whatever.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nLike, like, like I kind of like, like, like, like, like, like.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:47.000\nIs it about love or is it about?\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:48.000\nIt's about love.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:50.000\nOr about missing people or.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:55.000\nI love your face and your chicken too.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:58.000\nGive that chicken to me.\n\n09:58.000 --> 09:59.000\nYeah.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:00.000\nYeah.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nIt seems like back in the day.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:05.000\nOh, the chicken.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:08.000\nAre we recording this?\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nJustin, are we rolling?\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:13.000\nYeah.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:16.000\nIt seems like just the other day used to be so many ways in a different way.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:23.000\nUsed to be in the past, but now things have changed so much in the usual way.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nI think we got, I think we got something good here.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nYou know, you know, you know what it is, Jeff?\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:28.000\nToo many.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:29.000\nOh, this.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:30.000\nOkay.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:31.000\nThis.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:32.000\nOkay.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:33.000\nPhones tripping out.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nYeah.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nYeah.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:39.000\nI was like, how do you turn that?\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:46.000\nTriple finger double tap to two in the pink or what?\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:49.000\nIt's one on the app and two in the crap.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:50.000\nNo.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nNow I'm just adding appointments.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nAdding appointments everywhere.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nI have nine.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nPut it down.\n\n10:58.000 --> 10:59.000\nThis is serious.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:00.000\nThis is a serious problem.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:01.000\nZoom out.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:02.000\nOkay.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:03.000\nHe got it.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:04.000\nOkay.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:08.000\nWell, I eventually hit the screen so much that it went into some kind of like this.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:10.000\nThis isn't a chimps cage mode.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:15.000\nAnd it brought up a menu that a chimp could understand that the top thing was like zoom\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:20.000\nout, return to your banana.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:21.000\nAll right.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:25.000\nSo anyway, so was, well, so was Khalifa is my new hero.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:29.000\nCause he, he was in LAX and he wouldn't get off of his hoverboard.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nYou, you rode one of those hoverboards.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:32.000\nI've not.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:35.000\nI'm, I'm, I've always around them or wrote the drawing room after the show and we're\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:38.000\ndrinking and it seems like a terrible idea to get on one of those drunk.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:40.000\nI've seen some people wipe the fuck out on those.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:43.000\nOh, those, you're talking about those mini segue things.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:44.000\nYeah.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:45.000\nThose, those, uh, what do you call this?\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:46.000\nYeah.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:47.000\nIt's a segue without a, without a handle.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:50.000\nWiz Khalifa loves them and he, and he loves it so much.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:53.000\nHe was riding around LAX with them and the cops were like, you got to stop that.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:54.000\nAnd he's like, why?\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:55.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nAnd, and, and they're like, yeah, you do.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\nAnd he's like, what are you going to arrest me for not doing what you say?\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:01.000\nAwesome.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nGood, good, good question.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:04.000\nThat's not against the law.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:05.000\nFucking cops.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:06.000\nWhat are you a judge?\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:07.000\nLike there's no, what's the law?\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:08.000\nNo hoverboard law?\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nYou can't go skateboarding around LAX.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:13.000\nYou drive little trucks all around the fucking LAX.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nYeah.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:15.000\nAnd if you ever been to another airport.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:16.000\nDown the hallways.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:21.000\nLike international airports, like Japanese, uh, uh, like, like, like business men, they\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nride, fuck it.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:23.000\nThey have like scooters.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:27.200\nThey inspect your gadgets, roller skate shoes, and they have like crazy, like their luggage\n\n12:27.200 --> 12:31.200\nturns into a fucking like, like, uh, uh, a fucking wave runner.\n\n12:31.200 --> 12:36.200\nLike they, like, you're like, what the fuck am I in trouble?\n\n12:36.200 --> 12:37.200\nIs that Al-Qaeda?\n\n12:37.200 --> 12:39.200\nAnd they're like, no, that's a Japanese guy.\n\n12:39.200 --> 12:41.200\nHe knows what he's doing.\n\n12:41.200 --> 12:42.200\nThese are the passengers.\n\n12:42.200 --> 12:43.200\nThis is not.\n\n12:43.200 --> 12:44.200\nYeah, passengers.\n\n12:44.200 --> 12:45.200\nWhat the fuck?\n\n12:45.200 --> 12:46.200\nYeah.\n\n12:46.200 --> 12:47.200\nI want to do that.\n\n12:47.200 --> 12:48.200\nSo here's the thing about airports.\n\n12:48.200 --> 12:49.200\nHere's the thing about the TSA.\n\n12:49.200 --> 12:50.200\nHere's the thing about our panic.\n\n12:50.200 --> 12:55.600\nHere's the thing about going into these places and the religion being, don't, don't do anything\n\n12:55.600 --> 12:57.240\nweird, don't do anything wrong.\n\n12:57.240 --> 12:58.800\nI just want to say about that.\n\n12:58.800 --> 13:01.600\nLike we keep falling back on this hot button of like, oh, it must be so hard.\n\n13:01.600 --> 13:03.040\nAnd it's, oh, there's so many things at stake.\n\n13:03.040 --> 13:08.200\nMeanwhile, as we all learned for 10 years, we were worshiping at this altar and, you\n\n13:08.200 --> 13:12.800\nknow, fine, like, like we were doing it for nothing because you could have had a gun in\n\n13:12.800 --> 13:13.800\nyour hat.\n\n13:13.800 --> 13:17.280\nLike, like, like in 95% of them would have gotten through like, like they, they, they\n\n13:17.280 --> 13:21.560\ntested it and then there's still, so forget about that for a second.\n\n13:21.560 --> 13:24.480\nJust observe the fact that like, like it's a checkpoint.\n\n13:24.480 --> 13:25.880\nIt's a security checkpoint.\n\n13:25.880 --> 13:28.560\nYou know what's a really bad idea for security checkpoints?\n\n13:28.560 --> 13:29.560\nLike disruptability.\n\n13:29.560 --> 13:34.400\nDo you know what, do you know what all there is at that place is fucking ways that they\n\n13:34.400 --> 13:36.480\ntell you you can disrupt them.\n\n13:36.480 --> 13:38.360\nLike they're advertising about it.\n\n13:38.360 --> 13:41.120\nIt's like, well, don't, don't make a, don't make the wrong comment.\n\n13:41.120 --> 13:42.120\nDon't make the wrong joke.\n\n13:42.120 --> 13:45.160\nDon't you motherfuckers have shit under control?\n\n13:45.160 --> 13:48.280\nBecause if you do, I should be able to make a joke.\n\n13:48.280 --> 13:49.280\nEveryone should be able to.\n\n13:49.280 --> 13:57.560\nBe able to run into an airport with seven prop like dynamite vests on like one of those\n\n13:57.560 --> 14:04.440\nMichael Jackson, Venice beach things and be like, six of me are terrorists and they should\n\n14:04.440 --> 14:08.320\nbe like, knock it off, sir.\n\n14:08.320 --> 14:11.920\nThat's too big for the luggage rack.\n\n14:11.920 --> 14:16.720\nI bought extra seats and it's like, but you know, in the end, if I did, you know, if it's\n\n14:16.720 --> 14:21.360\nnot, if the dogs don't bark or if I don't get a gray swab reading or what, have your\n\n14:21.360 --> 14:22.360\ndraconian rules.\n\n14:22.360 --> 14:26.400\nI did something, well, the last trip I took, I guess when we were going to New York for\n\n14:26.400 --> 14:32.960\nHarmontown out there, I went into LAX and they said, I'm sir randomly, can you, can\n\n14:32.960 --> 14:36.200\nyou put your palm out and they do like the, you know, the explosive residue test with\n\n14:36.200 --> 14:38.920\na little, you know, a little ravioli looking little pieces of cloth.\n\n14:38.920 --> 14:40.920\nThey do look like ravioli.\n\n14:40.920 --> 14:42.400\nWhy, why, why is that?\n\n14:42.400 --> 14:43.400\nI don't know.\n\n14:43.400 --> 14:47.080\nWhy does ravioli have to look like, like, like, have those little, little teeth around\n\n14:47.080 --> 14:48.080\nthe edge?\n\n14:48.080 --> 14:49.080\nI think that's how you kind of crimp them together.\n\n14:49.080 --> 14:50.080\nYou close them up that way.\n\n14:50.080 --> 14:51.080\nLike you take a fork and you crimp them.\n\n14:51.080 --> 14:52.080\nIt's also stylish.\n\n14:52.080 --> 14:55.280\nThat's the fastening system to keep a ravioli together, man.\n\n14:55.280 --> 14:58.840\nBut then I wonder why that little, that little swatch has to have it because patches have\n\n14:58.840 --> 14:59.840\nthose too.\n\n14:59.840 --> 15:00.840\nYeah.\n\n15:00.840 --> 15:03.000\nWell, that's like what this, like this, what are those pinking shirts?\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.600\nWhat's the ones the zigzaggy ones, right?\n\n15:04.600 --> 15:07.440\nThat's so that doesn't fray, you know, at the end.\n\n15:07.440 --> 15:08.520\nMaybe they don't want those to fray.\n\n15:08.520 --> 15:09.520\nI guess not.\n\n15:09.520 --> 15:10.520\nThey probably don't.\n\n15:10.520 --> 15:11.520\nPlease continue your story.\n\n15:11.520 --> 15:16.120\nHey, hey, this story's full of all kinds of Easter eggs we can explore if you want.\n\n15:16.120 --> 15:19.440\nAnd by the way, if you're not enjoying the show, this is all bonus content.\n\n15:19.440 --> 15:21.440\nThis is usually when we start.\n\n15:21.440 --> 15:28.160\nThat was the cold open.\n\n15:28.160 --> 15:36.200\nSo instantly, Like the alarm's going off.\n\n15:36.200 --> 15:39.920\nAnd you're sick and two.\n\n15:39.920 --> 15:42.840\nSo it kind of goes red alert.\n\n15:42.840 --> 15:46.360\nThese two guys, instantly, one guy looks over and goes,\n\n15:46.360 --> 15:46.880\nwhat's going on?\n\n15:46.880 --> 15:48.160\nThe guy gets like, it's beeping.\n\n15:48.160 --> 15:51.600\nHe's like, he's like, this doesn't happen.\n\n15:51.600 --> 15:52.720\nAnd I'm like, uh-oh.\n\n15:52.720 --> 15:53.920\nAnd the other guy comes over and he's like,\n\n15:53.920 --> 15:54.880\nwhat do you mean it's beeping?\n\n15:54.880 --> 15:56.160\nHe's like, the thing is, it beeps.\n\n15:56.160 --> 15:57.240\nI put it on his hand and it beeps.\n\n15:57.240 --> 15:59.640\nAnd he's like, OK, sir, you have to come with us.\n\n15:59.640 --> 16:03.200\nAnd so they walked me all the way around the line,\n\n16:03.200 --> 16:05.400\nlike to the front of the line, took all my shit through\n\n16:05.400 --> 16:06.360\nsecurity, put it on a belt.\n\n16:06.360 --> 16:11.800\nSo I go in front of the line, OK,\n\n16:11.800 --> 16:13.800\nthey're going to find out a secondary thing\n\n16:13.800 --> 16:15.800\nthat I didn't make a bomb today.\n\n16:15.800 --> 16:17.440\nAnd I'm going to have to get to go.\n\n16:17.440 --> 16:20.280\nMeanwhile, guess how many fucking bombs can get through?\n\n16:20.280 --> 16:21.520\nWell, that's happening.\n\n16:21.520 --> 16:23.440\nAnyways, quick note.\n\n16:23.440 --> 16:27.200\nSo I guess we're going to go, they open up everything,\n\n16:27.200 --> 16:28.800\nall my stuff, and take everything out.\n\n16:28.800 --> 16:31.800\nAnd they wipe everything down with another little ravioli.\n\n16:31.800 --> 16:34.760\nI don't know how many raviolis they went through on this.\n\n16:34.760 --> 16:36.920\nBut you could have had a lovely Italian meal then.\n\n16:36.920 --> 16:41.880\nGet a nice sauce.\n\n16:41.880 --> 16:46.000\nSo then they take me into the sanctum sanctorum,\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:47.320\nthis little private room.\n\n16:47.320 --> 16:49.280\nThey go, we're going to take you in this room,\n\n16:49.280 --> 16:51.720\nand we're going to have to give you a full search,\n\n16:51.720 --> 16:53.360\na full pat down.\n\n16:53.360 --> 16:54.960\nAnd I'm like, OK.\n\n16:54.960 --> 16:57.680\nAnd they go, but there's going to be two of us in the room.\n\n16:57.680 --> 16:59.800\nI'm like, OK, tell me why.\n\n16:59.800 --> 17:01.760\nBecause it's so someone is watching to make sure\n\n17:01.760 --> 17:03.360\nthat nothing he knows, whatever.\n\n17:03.360 --> 17:05.120\nBut they both really got in there, man.\n\n17:05.120 --> 17:07.640\nThey were like, I'm going to be touching you\n\n17:07.640 --> 17:09.560\nright on your situation.\n\n17:09.560 --> 17:11.960\nAnd it was fucking romantic.\n\n17:14.960 --> 17:18.360\nI'm like, you guys do work here, right?\n\n17:18.360 --> 17:21.680\nIt was so hard not to crack a joke in there.\n\n17:21.680 --> 17:22.720\nI'm just like, wow.\n\n17:22.720 --> 17:25.000\nWhat you can't do, because that's how they get you.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:25.920\nYeah, exactly.\n\n17:25.920 --> 17:27.320\nThat's how El Kano will slip up.\n\n17:27.320 --> 17:28.880\nThey'll make a funny, funny joke.\n\n17:28.880 --> 17:36.080\nLike, don't be like, oh, knock, knock.\n\n17:36.080 --> 17:38.560\nWho's there?\n\n17:38.560 --> 17:40.280\nKaboom, boom.\n\n17:40.280 --> 17:42.520\nIt's like, OK, you're being awfully\n\n17:42.520 --> 17:44.720\nchipper about this whole thing.\n\n17:44.720 --> 17:46.440\nStep over there.\n\n17:46.440 --> 17:48.960\nWe're not profiling, sir, except for just based\n\n17:48.960 --> 17:49.840\non your wordplay.\n\n17:53.240 --> 17:53.800\nYeah, so I mean.\n\n17:53.800 --> 17:55.440\nI don't want to say he lingered on my dick,\n\n17:55.440 --> 17:58.400\nbut it certainly, it wasn't cursory.\n\n17:58.400 --> 18:00.920\nIt was, it was, it was, it was thorough.\n\n18:00.920 --> 18:02.480\nSo that's a third base, I think.\n\n18:02.480 --> 18:04.320\nAnd if you were, if you were, if you were told,\n\n18:04.320 --> 18:06.120\nand I don't think, I don't think the guy was like hover\n\n18:06.120 --> 18:13.000\nboarding through the X-ray machine toward the cockpit.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.680\nI think, I think he was probably literally,\n\n18:15.680 --> 18:17.880\nI'm going to guess, if I know Wiz Khalifa.\n\n18:17.880 --> 18:19.800\nHe was going to.\n\n18:19.800 --> 18:21.720\nI'm pretty sure he was probably in ticketing.\n\n18:21.720 --> 18:24.560\nYou know, he was probably hovering at the kiosk where\n\n18:24.560 --> 18:27.000\nyou get yourself checked in.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.360\nAnd he was probably like, I love, I love the holla.\n\n18:29.360 --> 18:31.560\nI love the holla.\n\n18:31.560 --> 18:33.720\nBecause he really, because these are the two things I really\n\n18:33.720 --> 18:34.480\nlike about this guy.\n\n18:34.480 --> 18:36.960\n27 years old, covered in tattoos.\n\n18:36.960 --> 18:41.280\nLooking at him, he's the old white man's worst nightmare.\n\n18:41.280 --> 18:44.920\nYou definitely want him off your lawn before anybody else.\n\n18:44.920 --> 18:48.760\nBut very, very, very, very, very soft, turns out very,\n\n18:48.760 --> 18:51.360\nvery soft-spoken and very, like, he's Henry David Thoreau.\n\n18:51.360 --> 18:54.760\nHe's like, he acted in total civil disobedience.\n\n18:54.760 --> 18:57.160\nHe's just like, no, I don't want to get off my hoverboard.\n\n18:57.160 --> 18:58.920\nI don't understand what's happening.\n\n18:58.920 --> 19:00.280\nAm I being arrested or detained?\n\n19:00.280 --> 19:01.800\nAnd then, you know, they slam him to the floor.\n\n19:01.800 --> 19:03.760\nAnd they're just like, stop resisting.\n\n19:03.760 --> 19:06.560\nThat weird voice they use, they sound like lizards.\n\n19:06.560 --> 19:08.440\nStop resisting.\n\n19:08.440 --> 19:10.840\nStop resisting.\n\n19:10.840 --> 19:12.720\nAnd he just keeps going, I'm not resisting, sir.\n\n19:12.720 --> 19:13.840\nI'm not resisting, sir.\n\n19:13.840 --> 19:15.960\nI mean, he's probably done it a thousand times.\n\n19:15.960 --> 19:18.080\nAnd he was tweeting about the whole thing.\n\n19:18.080 --> 19:19.400\nI'm going to guess with that, I've\n\n19:19.400 --> 19:21.760\npet peeved of mine that police insist on calling\n\n19:21.760 --> 19:23.360\neverything a vehicle.\n\n19:23.360 --> 19:24.840\nJust say car.\n\n19:24.840 --> 19:25.520\nYeah.\n\n19:25.520 --> 19:26.760\nGet out of the vehicle, sir.\n\n19:26.760 --> 19:28.800\nWell, Jeff, what you have to understand\n\n19:28.800 --> 19:30.760\nis that at this point in time that they have to speak longer\n\n19:30.760 --> 19:32.200\nso that they can take longer to figure out\n\n19:32.200 --> 19:33.400\nwhat it is that they're trying to say\n\n19:33.400 --> 19:34.600\nat this particular juncture.\n\n19:34.600 --> 19:36.080\nYeah.\n\n19:36.080 --> 19:39.760\nSo they figured out, there's like, what's Styrofoam words?\n\n19:39.760 --> 19:47.800\nBecause they can't go, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, bad driving?\n\n19:47.800 --> 19:49.000\nTicket here.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:53.800\nI was like, they probably, they pound that into their heads\n\n19:53.800 --> 19:57.920\nfor the entire six weeks you are trained to, uh,\n\n19:57.920 --> 20:01.160\nto then walk into the public with a gun.\n\n20:01.160 --> 20:04.320\nThey, during that six weeks, they tell you, uh,\n\n20:04.320 --> 20:08.160\nthese people are animals, and you have to, uh,\n\n20:08.160 --> 20:10.000\nyou have to hold a chair in front of you,\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.240\nbut you're not allowed to hold a chair because of these fucking\n\n20:12.240 --> 20:13.640\nlawyers.\n\n20:13.640 --> 20:15.960\nSo your chair has to be your attitude.\n\n20:15.960 --> 20:18.400\nYou know, you have to, because if you turn your fucking\n\n20:18.400 --> 20:21.000\nfucking people will just rip your skin off and wear it\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:25.440\nlike a fucking hat, you know, they're just waiting.\n\n20:25.440 --> 20:26.240\nThey're just waiting.\n\n20:26.240 --> 20:28.200\nOh, they'd love it if you didn't show up for work tomorrow.\n\n20:28.200 --> 20:32.000\nThey would just, oh, they'd eat all the ice cream.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.240\nThey'd be hoverboarding everywhere.\n\n20:34.240 --> 20:35.440\nThey'd never stop hovering.\n\n20:35.440 --> 20:38.800\nAnd among the many hilarious things\n\n20:38.800 --> 20:42.840\nthat Mr. Khalifa pointed out, or I call them whiz,\n\n20:42.840 --> 20:45.200\nbecause I feel like we're friends,\n\n20:45.200 --> 20:47.520\nis that in two years, the cops are\n\n20:47.520 --> 20:49.160\ngoing to be riding these things all over.\n\n20:49.160 --> 20:50.880\nThat's what, this is going to be their new thing.\n\n20:50.880 --> 20:53.880\nThere's going to be hover cops fucking like whizzing around.\n\n20:53.880 --> 20:57.680\nAnd he said, it'll probably be one that I designed,\n\n20:57.680 --> 20:59.120\nwhich I thought was weird.\n\n20:59.120 --> 21:00.400\nBut then I thought, you know what?\n\n21:00.400 --> 21:02.120\nHe's probably a stockholder of the fucking hoverboards.\n\n21:02.120 --> 21:03.440\nNow he's even more my hero.\n\n21:03.440 --> 21:04.880\nHe's a fucking marketing genius.\n\n21:04.880 --> 21:06.120\nYeah.\n\n21:06.120 --> 21:07.440\nHe probably paid the cops.\n\n21:07.440 --> 21:10.320\nSee now, was it just a big, was it just a big commercial stunt?\n\n21:10.320 --> 21:12.280\nIf it was, it's the kind of commercial I approve of.\n\n21:15.280 --> 21:16.360\nBut anyways, I like them.\n\n21:16.360 --> 21:17.640\nLet's invite them on the show.\n\n21:17.640 --> 21:19.960\nWell, I tweeted at them, so usually that\n\n21:19.960 --> 21:23.160\nends with people coming on the show, right?\n\n21:23.160 --> 21:24.640\nI tweeted at them.\n\n21:24.640 --> 21:30.080\nI saw your face in the news, and your hoverboard problems.\n\n21:32.840 --> 21:36.160\nI didn't say blues, because I didn't want to do it\n\n21:36.160 --> 21:37.960\non the nose rhyme.\n\n21:37.960 --> 21:41.480\nAnd I know this isn't you singing in that song\n\n21:41.480 --> 21:43.320\nfrom Fast and Furious.\n\n21:43.320 --> 21:48.120\nBut the next part is probably you.\n\n21:48.120 --> 21:51.040\nYo, yo, it seems like back in the day,\n\n21:51.040 --> 21:53.480\nyou were at LAX in the usual passenger way.\n\n21:53.480 --> 21:55.960\nYou tried to hoverboard your way through the usual way.\n\n21:55.960 --> 21:57.920\nBut the cops and the cops and the hoppers and the hoppers\n\n21:57.920 --> 21:58.760\nand the lop-a-dops.\n\n22:01.760 --> 22:03.600\nAnd when you come on our show.\n\n22:03.600 --> 22:04.960\nYou know what's amazing?\n\n22:04.960 --> 22:09.320\nThose lyrics are as true today as the day they're in.\n\n22:09.320 --> 22:11.960\nPeople be talking about, so talk about how about going out.\n\n22:11.960 --> 22:12.680\nI can't do it.\n\n22:12.680 --> 22:15.400\nLots of things are happening in various ways.\n\n22:15.400 --> 22:18.160\nAll right, so they're panicking about, well,\n\n22:18.160 --> 22:22.000\nthis is from our international correspondent, Irish Aaron\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:23.640\nMcGathey.\n\n22:23.640 --> 22:26.280\nShe's a show's texting with her today.\n\n22:26.280 --> 22:30.600\nWe only have a little window, because of the time difference.\n\n22:30.600 --> 22:32.200\nSo we try to pack a lot of communication in.\n\n22:32.200 --> 22:36.560\nBut the Irish are actually a little bit concerned\n\n22:36.560 --> 22:37.280\nabout Donald Trump.\n\n22:37.280 --> 22:38.640\nThey think he's going to win.\n\n22:38.640 --> 22:41.600\nAnd they're like asking her, because she's\n\n22:41.600 --> 22:42.760\nthe American ambassador.\n\n22:42.760 --> 22:44.880\nThey're like, he's not going to win, is he?\n\n22:44.880 --> 22:46.600\nSo it's going to make people with red hair\n\n22:46.600 --> 22:47.760\nlook bad all around the world.\n\n22:47.760 --> 22:50.360\nThat's what they're scared about.\n\n22:50.360 --> 22:52.680\nAnd I told her, as I said, tell them\n\n22:52.680 --> 22:54.520\nthat the media has been more globalized\n\n22:54.520 --> 22:55.640\nover the last couple of years.\n\n22:55.640 --> 22:58.400\nSo everything seems to be happening sooner and more\n\n22:58.400 --> 22:59.080\nsincerely.\n\n22:59.080 --> 23:03.760\nBut this is usual year from the election pre-circus.\n\n23:03.760 --> 23:06.320\nI mean, we lucked out with this guy.\n\n23:06.320 --> 23:08.600\nHe's fucking amazing.\n\n23:08.600 --> 23:12.920\nBut if you step back and look at it\n\n23:12.920 --> 23:14.840\nas the Republicans and Democrats functioning\n\n23:14.840 --> 23:16.760\nas one organization, which they literally do,\n\n23:16.760 --> 23:19.200\nand that does not mean that health care and all the issues\n\n23:19.200 --> 23:20.600\nthat they break down microcosmically\n\n23:20.600 --> 23:23.120\nare not important to human beings,\n\n23:23.120 --> 23:24.960\nI'm just saying these guys literally\n\n23:24.960 --> 23:28.920\nare a single, quality corporation.\n\n23:28.920 --> 23:29.800\nThey run the debates.\n\n23:29.800 --> 23:31.040\nThey run the election.\n\n23:31.040 --> 23:34.920\nAn argument could be made that they completely marginalize\n\n23:34.920 --> 23:37.800\nthe entire spectrum of political thought around the planet.\n\n23:37.800 --> 23:39.240\nBecause everybody has followed suit\n\n23:39.240 --> 23:43.400\nwith this weird duopoly dichotomy of elephants and donkeys.\n\n23:43.400 --> 23:47.960\nI just call them bananas and cantaloupes in Bavaria.\n\n23:47.960 --> 23:49.360\nI don't know what that.\n\n23:49.360 --> 23:51.600\nOh, they's all the pudding party.\n\n23:51.600 --> 23:52.320\nThere they go again.\n\n23:52.320 --> 23:54.360\nAnd it's like, I think you learn this from us.\n\n23:54.360 --> 23:56.640\nThere's this Coke Pepsi thing that\n\n23:56.640 --> 23:59.280\nevolves if your empire is perfectly comfortable.\n\n23:59.280 --> 24:03.720\nAnd it just turns into this kind of just standard kind\n\n24:03.720 --> 24:07.600\nof like, well, we don't really want to change anything.\n\n24:07.600 --> 24:11.040\nBut here's our two moods.\n\n24:11.040 --> 24:12.800\nWe want everybody to be happy.\n\n24:12.800 --> 24:15.400\nI'm not going to do anything about it.\n\n24:15.400 --> 24:18.680\nSo let's run those two thoughts against each other.\n\n24:18.680 --> 24:22.200\nAnd the good news about that is it's Trump-proof.\n\n24:22.200 --> 24:23.640\nHe's not going to get elected.\n\n24:23.640 --> 24:27.840\nThese people, they wouldn't let a third party\n\n24:27.840 --> 24:29.920\ncome near the possibility.\n\n24:29.920 --> 24:35.080\nBefore that happens, Seattle will explode when Trump's in it.\n\n24:35.080 --> 24:38.480\nAnd then people will be like, I don't know, it's a weird coffee\n\n24:38.480 --> 24:40.480\nexplosion.\n\n24:40.480 --> 24:41.480\nIt's part of global warming.\n\n24:41.480 --> 24:42.960\nAnd the city blew up.\n\n24:42.960 --> 24:46.040\nAnd so Trump's dead.\n\n24:46.040 --> 24:47.960\nI mean, they don't have to do that though.\n\n24:47.960 --> 24:50.400\nI think it's going to have to get pretty sloppy\n\n24:50.400 --> 24:51.880\nbefore this is all done.\n\n24:51.880 --> 24:53.840\nBut that's why they're giving him a year.\n\n24:53.840 --> 24:55.040\nLike, that's what it's all about.\n\n24:55.040 --> 24:58.120\nThis is a ritualistic murder of a guy who's unauthorized.\n\n24:58.120 --> 25:00.600\nI think it's sad that he functions,\n\n25:00.600 --> 25:01.880\nthat he registers as anything.\n\n25:01.880 --> 25:03.400\nAll this guy is as a friend of your dad's.\n\n25:03.400 --> 25:07.320\nLike, he's not even, like, Bernie Sanders\n\n25:07.320 --> 25:09.960\nshould be the one that's raising a stink, and he is.\n\n25:09.960 --> 25:12.920\nBut he's raising it in a boring way.\n\n25:12.920 --> 25:15.680\nBut people are so into, and yeah,\n\n25:15.680 --> 25:18.320\nhis hair is very interesting.\n\n25:18.320 --> 25:22.440\nAnd he does say things like, on the view when he was taught,\n\n25:22.440 --> 25:23.640\nthis is an old quote.\n\n25:23.640 --> 25:25.640\nBut now people are like, people are so concerned\n\n25:25.640 --> 25:27.640\nthat Donald Trump is going to win,\n\n25:27.640 --> 25:31.200\nthat they're really coming at him in a kind of like,\n\n25:31.200 --> 25:34.960\nhe's the anti-Christ, like, as if he hasn't been,\n\n25:34.960 --> 25:36.800\nas Spencer said today at dinner,\n\n25:38.320 --> 25:40.040\nI feel like Donald Trump's been running for president\n\n25:40.040 --> 25:42.040\nfor 30 years.\n\n25:42.040 --> 25:43.560\nAnd it's just now getting traction.\n\n25:43.560 --> 25:45.000\nHe has, though, right?\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:46.560\nThat's all he's ever been doing is going like,\n\n25:46.560 --> 25:47.720\nI'll tell you what I would do to it.\n\n25:47.720 --> 25:48.800\nI'll tell you why I'll do it.\n\n25:48.800 --> 25:50.440\nI would put me in charge, and here's why.\n\n25:50.440 --> 25:51.360\nMy air conditioning works.\n\n25:51.360 --> 25:54.800\nI'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.\n\n25:54.800 --> 25:59.040\nAnd now, all of a sudden, it's just this particularly\n\n25:59.040 --> 26:02.000\nboring election, and who cares?\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:05.240\nBut anyways, I forgot what I was going to say.\n\n26:05.240 --> 26:06.240\nThe view.\n\n26:06.240 --> 26:07.880\nOh, he said on the view like a couple of years ago,\n\n26:07.880 --> 26:08.840\nAaron sent me this quote.\n\n26:08.840 --> 26:10.120\nHe said, because he was taught,\n\n26:10.120 --> 26:12.760\nthey were asking him about his daughter, Ivanka,\n\n26:12.760 --> 26:15.200\nbeing in Playboy, or whether she would be in Playboy.\n\n26:15.200 --> 26:17.000\nAnd he said, I don't think.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:18.960\nNow, quotes suck, like he quoted,\n\n26:18.960 --> 26:19.920\nyou're quoted on a context.\n\n26:19.920 --> 26:22.360\nI'm sure he was very charming and self-effacing about this.\n\n26:22.360 --> 26:25.840\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n26:25.840 --> 26:27.960\nBut the fact of the matter is,\n\n26:27.960 --> 26:32.120\nwhat he said was, and I don't think my daughter, Ivanka,\n\n26:32.120 --> 26:34.000\nI don't think she would do that,\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:35.720\nin reference to her posing for Playboy.\n\n26:35.720 --> 26:37.880\nAlthough she does have a very nice figure,\n\n26:37.880 --> 26:39.800\nI've said, if Ivanka weren't my daughter,\n\n26:39.800 --> 26:40.960\nperhaps I'd be dating her.\n\n26:40.960 --> 26:41.800\nWhoa!\n\n26:41.800 --> 26:42.640\nOh!\n\n26:44.360 --> 26:46.040\nJust to, just to split this hair.\n\n26:46.040 --> 26:49.240\nNow, I know you, the weird thing about this is, like,\n\n26:50.240 --> 26:51.080\nwhat is it?\n\n26:51.080 --> 26:54.320\nWhat is that reaction, like, in a cartoon,\n\n26:54.320 --> 26:55.440\nwe would look out and the whole audience\n\n26:55.440 --> 26:56.680\nwould have Trump hair all of a sudden.\n\n26:56.680 --> 26:58.520\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n26:58.520 --> 27:00.080\nI'll tell you the two parts of that joke\n\n27:00.080 --> 27:02.200\nthat are fun to analyze.\n\n27:02.200 --> 27:04.440\nIt's the, because, because I can picture myself.\n\n27:04.440 --> 27:06.800\nI like the gross incest and pedophile part.\n\n27:06.800 --> 27:07.800\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n27:07.800 --> 27:10.320\nI can picture myself putting my foot in that same mouth,\n\n27:10.320 --> 27:12.560\nlike if I had a daughter and someone brought that up\n\n27:12.560 --> 27:15.760\nto me, like, in Trapp, but, but, but, but the things are,\n\n27:15.760 --> 27:19.040\nthe word figure is weird\n\n27:19.040 --> 27:22.760\nbecause it evokes actual, her actual physical tissue.\n\n27:22.760 --> 27:25.760\nLike, like it's not saying, she's pretty, or she, you know,\n\n27:25.760 --> 27:27.160\nYeah, he's talking about tips and ask at that point.\n\n27:27.160 --> 27:28.760\nYeah, she has a nice figure.\n\n27:28.760 --> 27:33.640\nLike her boobs look good, like her ass looks like something\n\n27:33.640 --> 27:37.240\nyou would want to touch, is in that word figure.\n\n27:37.240 --> 27:41.240\nAnd then the real murderer is, I've said,\n\n27:41.240 --> 27:42.520\nlike he's quoting himself.\n\n27:42.520 --> 27:45.240\nHe's not putting his foot in his mouth.\n\n27:45.240 --> 27:47.160\nHe's taking his foot out of his mouth and going,\n\n27:47.160 --> 27:49.520\nyou know what I always say?\n\n27:49.520 --> 27:53.360\nA daughter fuck a day keeps a doctor alive.\n\n27:53.360 --> 27:54.200\nAnd you know what?\n\n27:54.200 --> 27:55.720\nYou're going to read me misquoted on that\n\n27:55.720 --> 27:57.800\nin previous things, and I'm setting the record straight.\n\n27:57.800 --> 28:00.560\nI got a hot daughter, and she's good to go.\n\n28:00.560 --> 28:02.000\nI got bumper stickers.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:03.680\nI've got posters, bumpers.\n\n28:03.680 --> 28:05.680\nI've been very, very candid about this.\n\n28:05.680 --> 28:07.560\nI said, I want to be, does the people\n\n28:07.560 --> 28:10.440\nthink I didn't say this?\n\n28:10.440 --> 28:12.640\nBecause it's not newsworthy.\n\n28:12.640 --> 28:15.360\nWell, I'm telling you, my daughter's hot.\n\n28:15.360 --> 28:16.520\nI've said it.\n\n28:16.520 --> 28:21.480\nAlso, the extra little cherry and peanut sprinkle\n\n28:21.480 --> 28:25.680\non top of that gross Sunday is the idea that, OK,\n\n28:25.680 --> 28:28.440\nlet's say you weren't your daughter,\n\n28:28.440 --> 28:31.280\nbut the presumption being that this hot woman would date you.\n\n28:31.280 --> 28:32.480\nLike, well, we'd be dating.\n\n28:32.480 --> 28:34.240\nI should actually be in the bag.\n\n28:34.240 --> 28:36.600\nWell, this is where I'll split the semantic here.\n\n28:36.600 --> 28:40.400\nIf Donald Trump were a guest on the show, hope, hope, hope.\n\n28:40.400 --> 28:42.880\nFuck.\n\n28:42.880 --> 28:47.760\nOr if anybody that chose to take that side for whatever reason,\n\n28:47.760 --> 28:50.480\nin other words, to be the devil's advocate.\n\n28:50.480 --> 28:52.880\nBut there's not another side to the issue,\n\n28:52.880 --> 28:54.680\nbut there is just the mitigating factor\n\n28:54.680 --> 28:57.360\nthat I realized when I was reading more about that quote.\n\n28:57.360 --> 28:59.440\nBecause I thought it might just be a fabricated quote\n\n28:59.440 --> 29:00.200\nthat somebody just made up.\n\n29:00.200 --> 29:02.280\nBecause it's kind of believable that he would say that,\n\n29:02.280 --> 29:04.520\nbut also unbelievable to say.\n\n29:04.520 --> 29:08.000\nAnyways, he said it on the view, and you read the larger\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:12.760\ncontext, and you're kind of like, all right, in his mind,\n\n29:12.760 --> 29:19.520\nhis bit is that he's often lampooned for dating young women.\n\n29:19.520 --> 29:23.640\nIt's like, you know me, old young fucker.\n\n29:23.640 --> 29:27.000\nIt's funny, because all the fucking I do with young women,\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.760\nit's to the point where the young women I make by fucking,\n\n29:29.760 --> 29:30.520\nI'd fuck them.\n\n29:35.400 --> 29:36.160\nI know, I know.\n\n29:36.160 --> 29:38.360\nDean Martin drinks, and I do that.\n\n29:42.120 --> 29:44.680\nLike, in his mind, he's like, that's my gimmick,\n\n29:44.680 --> 29:46.520\nand I'm giving myself the raz.\n\n29:46.520 --> 29:51.680\nLike, because he's talking to the view women,\n\n29:51.680 --> 29:53.920\nhe's like, I know, ladies, before you even talk,\n\n29:53.920 --> 29:57.360\nbefore you even start lampooning me for my weaknesses,\n\n29:57.360 --> 30:00.040\nallow me to pierce myself to my own Achilles heel.\n\n30:00.040 --> 30:02.040\nI do fuck a lot of young women.\n\n30:02.040 --> 30:04.040\nMy daughter is very beautiful, so the dot\n\n30:04.040 --> 30:06.520\nis easy to connect there, that if she weren't my daughter,\n\n30:06.520 --> 30:08.720\nshe'd probably be one of the women I fucked,\n\n30:08.720 --> 30:10.040\nbecause of my flaws.\n\n30:13.960 --> 30:16.120\nAll right, well, it's good to give equal time to Donald Trump.\n\n30:16.120 --> 30:17.720\nHe hasn't been in the media a lot,\n\n30:17.720 --> 30:20.720\nso that's the beauty about podcasting,\n\n30:20.720 --> 30:23.920\nis you get to hear things that you wouldn't hear\n\n30:23.920 --> 30:24.640\nat other places.\n\n30:27.240 --> 30:29.480\nAll right, the raccoon is back eating my dog food,\n\n30:29.480 --> 30:32.400\nbut I think I've dealt with that by closing the app.\n\n30:32.400 --> 30:33.960\nSame raccoon, you think?\n\n30:33.960 --> 30:35.560\nOh, I don't know about that.\n\n30:35.560 --> 30:37.200\nI think they multiple.\n\n30:37.200 --> 30:39.040\nI mean, you just know recognizable features\n\n30:39.040 --> 30:39.800\non this raccoon?\n\n30:39.800 --> 30:42.600\nNo, oh yeah, like a bandit mask and opposable thumbs.\n\n30:42.600 --> 30:45.200\nNo, no, no, no, I literally haven't seen it,\n\n30:45.200 --> 30:46.960\nbut I've seen its paw prints in the water\n\n30:46.960 --> 30:48.480\naround the spilled water discharge.\n\n30:48.480 --> 30:51.400\nLike Harvey has to hold vigil, and he goes and barks at it,\n\n30:51.400 --> 30:52.600\nand then I see the paw prints.\n\n30:52.600 --> 30:55.320\nSo then I started closing the doggie door after a certain time.\n\n30:55.320 --> 30:58.200\nIf I close it too early, Nigel will piss on the floor.\n\n30:58.200 --> 30:59.040\nI found out.\n\n30:59.040 --> 31:01.720\nHarvey just got me right on the shoe the other day.\n\n31:01.720 --> 31:03.920\nI came in the door, he rolled over on his back,\n\n31:03.920 --> 31:06.280\nand I sort of pet in his belly, and just a little rainbow\n\n31:06.280 --> 31:08.520\nof pee right on my shoe.\n\n31:08.520 --> 31:11.080\nThat, I'm hoping, is his steroid medication\n\n31:11.080 --> 31:13.200\nfor his ear infection, which maybe was still\n\n31:13.200 --> 31:15.760\nweakening his bladder or something, I hope.\n\n31:15.760 --> 31:16.760\nI hope he's not.\n\n31:16.760 --> 31:18.640\nI hope it's not.\n\n31:18.640 --> 31:20.560\nAnd I don't even want to say what I hope it's not,\n\n31:20.560 --> 31:23.280\nbecause then if Erin's listening to that,\n\n31:23.280 --> 31:29.840\nbecause I hope it's not like anxiety from Erin being gone.\n\n31:29.840 --> 31:30.840\nThat could be.\n\n31:30.840 --> 31:33.000\nNo.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:37.000\nI mean, it's Occam's razor because that's\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:40.560\nhow I react to her being gone.\n\n31:40.560 --> 31:42.920\nYeah, I was pissed on my shoe so many times.\n\n31:42.920 --> 31:47.240\nI may as well just lay in my bed and I piss on my own stomach,\n\n31:47.240 --> 31:50.800\nbecause I'm like, well, who was I not doing this for?\n\n31:50.800 --> 31:53.960\nShe's in a different time zone.\n\n31:53.960 --> 31:55.720\nLike, not only is she a different country,\n\n31:55.720 --> 31:56.840\nbut her time is different.\n\n31:56.840 --> 31:59.040\nShe's looking at a sun when I'm looking at a moon.\n\n31:59.040 --> 32:01.080\nI can pee on myself.\n\n32:01.080 --> 32:03.560\nFinally.\n\n32:03.560 --> 32:07.240\nAre you getting a lot of video game play in while she's away?\n\n32:07.240 --> 32:10.440\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n32:10.440 --> 32:11.040\nIs that fine?\n\n32:11.040 --> 32:11.680\nYou enjoying it?\n\n32:11.680 --> 32:12.560\nYeah, very much.\n\n32:12.560 --> 32:15.240\nFar Cry 4 much?\n\n32:15.240 --> 32:18.280\nSure, sure.\n\n32:18.280 --> 32:20.880\nBut I actually like Far Cry 4 is so potentially\n\n32:20.880 --> 32:23.160\naddictive that I've actually been playing Grand Theft Auto 5\n\n32:23.160 --> 32:23.920\nfor some reason.\n\n32:23.920 --> 32:26.920\nLike, I don't know what it is.\n\n32:26.920 --> 32:28.040\nI just follow my cravings.\n\n32:28.040 --> 32:32.520\nBut I've been playing Grand Theft Auto 5 lately.\n\n32:32.520 --> 32:34.120\nI kept that sweatshirt on for too long\n\n32:34.120 --> 32:36.760\nand I told you guys last week, I'm hotter up here.\n\n32:36.760 --> 32:37.560\nI'm not fatter.\n\n32:37.560 --> 32:42.800\nOr if I am fatter, it's not.\n\n32:42.800 --> 32:43.720\nIt's healthy fat.\n\n32:43.720 --> 32:46.960\nIt's not coming out of me in the form of liquid.\n\n32:46.960 --> 32:48.520\nIf I was sitting where you were sitting,\n\n32:48.520 --> 32:49.600\nI would look like James Bond.\n\n32:54.320 --> 32:58.440\nYvonne Craig, we lost Yvonne Craig, TV's Batgirl\n\n32:58.440 --> 33:00.640\nfrom the Adam West series.\n\n33:00.640 --> 33:02.080\nWow.\n\n33:02.080 --> 33:05.560\nWhat do you say about that?\n\n33:05.560 --> 33:06.400\nNothing funny.\n\n33:06.400 --> 33:07.640\nNo.\n\n33:07.640 --> 33:09.720\nAnd also, nothing particularly sincere,\n\n33:09.720 --> 33:12.320\nbecause the true, sincere way in which she's a part of my life\n\n33:12.320 --> 33:14.160\nis the awakening of my sexuality.\n\n33:14.160 --> 33:18.560\nAnd it seems offensive to do that over someone's grave.\n\n33:18.560 --> 33:22.720\nI was like, whoa, thanks for giving me my first boner.\n\n33:22.720 --> 33:24.000\nJust throw a little dirt.\n\n33:27.080 --> 33:29.920\nFeels wrong to do that.\n\n33:29.920 --> 33:33.040\nYeah, but you can be honest with yourself about that, you know?\n\n33:33.040 --> 33:34.680\nI mean, you know what it is?\n\n33:34.680 --> 33:40.440\nDon't address her as if you're, like, just say,\n\n33:40.440 --> 33:41.640\nit's sad when people die.\n\n33:41.640 --> 33:45.960\nWe miss you, stranger, who we never knew, personally,\n\n33:45.960 --> 33:52.000\nspeaking of which, her image on the TV screen when I was,\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:54.640\nyou know, six or whatever.\n\n33:54.640 --> 33:59.160\nIt's like, it was the first dopamine spike in my head.\n\n33:59.160 --> 34:02.240\nYou saved us for the view, man.\n\n34:02.240 --> 34:03.720\nI've often said.\n\n34:03.720 --> 34:09.000\nI hope that Aaron and I have a beautiful redhead daughter\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:13.200\nthat'll dress like Batgirl, because knowing me,\n\n34:13.200 --> 34:17.840\nno, I'm making fun of myself, I'll fuck her.\n\n34:17.840 --> 34:19.200\nNo, I'm making fun of myself.\n\n34:23.400 --> 34:25.880\nI'm always fucking redheads.\n\n34:25.880 --> 34:27.320\nMy daughter was a redhead.\n\n34:27.320 --> 34:35.120\nIt's called self-deprecation, guys.\n\n34:40.480 --> 34:43.280\nThat's his idea of a joke making fun of himself.\n\n34:43.280 --> 34:45.800\nHe's not too smart.\n\n34:45.800 --> 34:47.760\nWhen he says he's often said it, does that\n\n34:47.760 --> 34:49.680\ninclude to her over breakfast?\n\n34:52.240 --> 34:55.280\nAnd is it there for any wonder that she's not a violinist,\n\n34:55.280 --> 34:57.400\nyou know, that she's just?\n\n35:04.040 --> 35:06.520\nEverybody be perfectly still.\n\n35:06.520 --> 35:10.560\nWe have a mythical creature in the room.\n\n35:10.560 --> 35:13.720\nIt's the ghost of LA Philharmonic stereotypes.\n\n35:20.200 --> 35:21.320\nThat was so cute.\n\n35:21.320 --> 35:22.720\nI feel like that person.\n\n35:22.720 --> 35:24.880\nWas that a man or a woman that made that laugh?\n\n35:24.880 --> 35:26.440\nIt was you.\n\n35:26.440 --> 35:29.880\nAre you a violinist, or are you just confused by my logic?\n\n35:29.880 --> 35:31.120\nOh, OK.\n\n35:31.120 --> 35:32.560\nInteresting.\n\n35:32.560 --> 35:35.200\nIs it your favorite, I mean, to his credit,\n\n35:35.200 --> 35:37.680\nhis face is kind of bright red right now.\n\n35:37.680 --> 35:39.400\nIt's very charming.\n\n35:39.400 --> 35:40.440\nThat was a sincere sound.\n\n35:40.440 --> 35:42.840\nHe didn't mean to take the spotlight.\n\n35:42.840 --> 35:44.480\nI was saying, well, I'll tell you now,\n\n35:44.480 --> 35:46.440\nsince you put yourself out there,\n\n35:46.440 --> 35:48.320\nI will put myself out there.\n\n35:48.320 --> 35:50.680\nI guess in the moment when I was riffing was,\n\n35:50.680 --> 35:52.520\nand maybe if we picked this apart,\n\n35:52.520 --> 35:55.440\nwe'll probably find out that I'm sexist somehow.\n\n35:55.440 --> 35:57.840\nBut I was saying, like, if you're\n\n35:57.840 --> 36:00.720\neating breakfast with a guy that talks like that to you,\n\n36:00.720 --> 36:02.600\nbecause isn't she like a model?\n\n36:02.600 --> 36:03.760\nI don't know the first thing about her.\n\n36:03.760 --> 36:06.160\nI thought she was also like a business person.\n\n36:06.160 --> 36:07.280\nAll right, fine.\n\n36:07.280 --> 36:08.840\nFine.\n\n36:08.840 --> 36:11.880\nSee, I'm sexist.\n\n36:11.880 --> 36:12.840\nI thought she was a model.\n\n36:12.840 --> 36:13.960\nThat's the end of that story.\n\n36:13.960 --> 36:16.240\nI thought she was a model.\n\n36:16.240 --> 36:17.640\nI didn't think, as me, I didn't think\n\n36:17.640 --> 36:19.360\nit was possible for her to be anything else.\n\n36:19.360 --> 36:21.640\nI don't get the Philharmonic stereotype joke.\n\n36:21.640 --> 36:23.400\nWhat does that mean?\n\n36:23.400 --> 36:28.000\nWell, that's not going to pull up if you pick it apart.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.640\nOK, I just thought you were connecting something.\n\n36:33.640 --> 36:35.680\nMy joke was, but it wouldn't make sense\n\n36:35.680 --> 36:37.920\nthat it was the ghost of LA Philharmonic Stereotypes.\n\n36:37.920 --> 36:41.880\nMy joke was that that was an entity in the crowd\n\n36:41.880 --> 36:44.480\nthat was tired of violinists being stereotypes.\n\n36:44.480 --> 36:45.480\nYou understand what I'm saying?\n\n36:45.480 --> 36:46.360\nOh, yeah.\n\n36:46.360 --> 36:48.760\nBut the ghost of stereotype doesn't make any sense.\n\n36:48.760 --> 36:49.840\nSo you caught me again.\n\n36:49.840 --> 36:52.480\nNo, no, I just thought I was missing something out.\n\n36:52.480 --> 36:55.640\nMaybe it shouldn't be a free podcast.\n\n36:59.880 --> 37:02.360\nWhat if we made it free, but if you\n\n37:02.360 --> 37:05.800\nwanted to listen to episodes older than a year,\n\n37:05.800 --> 37:08.720\nyou had to pay $5 a month?\n\n37:08.720 --> 37:11.040\nYeah, Dustin, high five.\n\n37:11.040 --> 37:12.080\nYeah.\n\n37:12.080 --> 37:14.520\nNo, we're not going to have any cross-label shit talk tonight\n\n37:14.520 --> 37:17.200\nbecause if our special guest is here, is he here?\n\n37:17.200 --> 37:18.120\nOh, cool.\n\n37:18.120 --> 37:19.920\nGreat.\n\n37:19.920 --> 37:21.920\nOur special guest has an ear-wolf podcast,\n\n37:21.920 --> 37:24.240\nso now you've done it.\n\n37:24.240 --> 37:26.800\nIt's not anymore?\n\n37:26.800 --> 37:27.640\nWait, what?\n\n37:27.640 --> 37:28.960\nIt's not an ear-wolf anymore.\n\n37:28.960 --> 37:29.600\nOh.\n\n37:29.600 --> 37:33.680\nNow who's being the brash?\n\n37:33.680 --> 37:36.240\nThat's not the word.\n\n37:36.240 --> 37:37.080\nKazing!\n\n37:37.080 --> 37:37.580\nYeah.\n\n37:40.320 --> 37:41.520\nHam-fisted.\n\n37:41.520 --> 37:42.840\nThat's the word I was looking for.\n\n37:42.840 --> 37:43.840\nIs he just wandering now?\n\n37:43.840 --> 37:44.600\nIs he a free agent?\n\n37:44.600 --> 37:47.000\nWell, yeah, ask me.\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.560\nOK, because we'll poach his ass.\n\n37:49.560 --> 37:52.000\nWe'll scoop him up.\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:53.160\nThat's easy for us to do.\n\n37:53.160 --> 37:55.320\nNow, pianist guy, what's your name?\n\n37:55.320 --> 37:56.240\nBarton Lewis.\n\n37:56.240 --> 38:00.720\nBarton Lewis and Barton Lewis.\n\n38:00.720 --> 38:02.440\nAnd the guy next to you, what's your name?\n\n38:02.440 --> 38:03.040\nJulia.\n\n38:03.040 --> 38:04.520\nYou seem to know a lot about this.\n\n38:04.520 --> 38:07.440\nDo you work with Horatio?\n\n38:07.440 --> 38:08.720\nI'm one of his best.\n\n38:08.720 --> 38:09.720\nI think they're part of his team.\n\n38:09.720 --> 38:10.760\nThey're how we were able to connect them.\n\n38:10.760 --> 38:11.320\nOh, great.\n\n38:11.320 --> 38:12.000\nWelcome to the show.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:13.480\nThanks for getting them for us.\n\n38:13.480 --> 38:15.560\nWell, let's bring them up.\n\n38:15.560 --> 38:18.680\nI totally blew the reveal on that.\n\n38:18.680 --> 38:19.200\nYeah, yeah.\n\n38:19.200 --> 38:20.200\nThere could be any Horatio.\n\n38:20.200 --> 38:22.560\nWe don't know what Horatio I'm talking about.\n\n38:22.560 --> 38:24.680\nRight, so I didn't hear you say Horatio,\n\n38:24.680 --> 38:26.400\nbut now fuck Jesus.\n\n38:30.400 --> 38:32.800\nHoratio Cummings, everybody.\n\n38:32.800 --> 38:35.600\nMaybe it's a hornblower?\n\n38:35.600 --> 38:37.080\nHoratio Hornblower.\n\n38:37.080 --> 38:39.080\nOh.\n\n38:39.080 --> 38:40.080\nOh.\n\n38:40.080 --> 38:41.080\nOh.\n\n38:41.080 --> 38:42.080\nI forgot your mic.\n\n38:42.080 --> 38:43.080\nMaybe it's a fifth Ninja Turtle?\n\n38:47.080 --> 38:50.080\nIt's more important to introduce the kind of like,\n\n38:50.080 --> 38:52.080\nI think one of the things that we're going to be talking to them\n\n38:52.080 --> 38:57.800\nabout, I hope, I hope to, is at least once on this show,\n\n38:57.800 --> 39:00.880\nand then I know on Doug Love's movies,\n\n39:00.880 --> 39:03.960\nwe've talked about our fascination with this movie,\n\n39:03.960 --> 39:06.960\nBoat Trip.\n\n39:06.960 --> 39:12.480\nAnd it was, you know, I was looking at the Wikipedia entry\n\n39:12.480 --> 39:14.800\nand looking at the, you know, you click that reception header\n\n39:14.800 --> 39:18.840\nand it comes down and it's like, it is a kind of historically\n\n39:18.840 --> 39:20.040\ncritically panned movie.\n\n39:20.040 --> 39:28.040\nIt takes its place up there, but it's one of those movies that's\n\n39:28.040 --> 39:33.520\nso, it's fascinating and confusing in a lot of parts.\n\n39:33.520 --> 39:36.440\nAnd so we have talked about it.\n\n39:36.440 --> 39:38.800\nAnd I say that without fear of being petty because he didn't\n\n39:38.800 --> 39:40.400\nwrite it or direct it or anything.\n\n39:40.400 --> 39:42.240\nNow I feel like the writer or director is going to kill\n\n39:42.240 --> 39:46.280\nhimself, but they probably, the bottom line is movies are\n\n39:46.280 --> 39:47.960\nflukes and God only knows what happens.\n\n39:47.960 --> 39:50.960\nBut he'd heard me talking about it or someone heard me talking\n\n39:50.960 --> 39:52.000\nabout it on Doug Love's movies.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:53.320\nSomebody got in touch with somebody.\n\n39:53.320 --> 39:54.960\nDeMorge Brown was involved somehow.\n\n39:54.960 --> 39:56.720\nSomething happened and they were like, he should come on the\n\n39:56.720 --> 39:59.400\nshow and I think he was game, either that or he's just the\n\n39:59.400 --> 40:01.120\nnicest guy in the world and was just like, why is everyone\n\n40:01.120 --> 40:04.120\ntelling me to come here and now it's mean?\n\n40:04.120 --> 40:06.640\nBut I think he was involved too and was like, yeah, I want to\n\n40:06.640 --> 40:07.400\ncome and talk about it.\n\n40:07.400 --> 40:10.720\nAnyways, at any rate, it'll be interesting to talk to him\n\n40:10.720 --> 40:12.920\nabout anything because he's been a part of the comedic\n\n40:12.920 --> 40:15.880\nwallpaper for over a decade.\n\n40:15.880 --> 40:21.400\nHe's a founding member of, the right word, like he was down\n\n40:21.400 --> 40:23.840\nthere in the trenches when Upright Citizens Brigade was\n\n40:23.840 --> 40:29.880\njust an actual downright non-citizen brigade.\n\n40:29.880 --> 40:32.920\nAnd he was on SNL for years and years and years and years.\n\n40:32.920 --> 40:41.360\nAnd then he was in Bo Tripp and all kinds of other stuff.\n\n40:41.360 --> 40:42.760\nBut let's bring him out and get to know him.\n\n40:42.760 --> 40:43.840\nHoratio Sanz is here.\n\n40:43.840 --> 41:05.040\nSorry about my horrible introduction and sorry in advance\n\n41:05.040 --> 41:06.040\nfor my bad interviewing.\n\n41:06.040 --> 41:08.280\nWell, no, I'm glad you explained everybody what was\n\n41:08.280 --> 41:09.280\nhappening.\n\n41:09.280 --> 41:15.600\nAre you being sarcastic because I did want them to know.\n\n41:15.600 --> 41:16.600\nNo, no, I'm not.\n\n41:16.600 --> 41:18.280\nI'm glad that you did, actually.\n\n41:18.280 --> 41:19.280\nYeah.\n\n41:19.280 --> 41:23.360\nBut I'm not even sure, can you catch us up on your part?\n\n41:23.360 --> 41:29.000\nBecause I haven't talked to you about this until now.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.160\nI didn't see you in the green room, for instance.\n\n41:31.160 --> 41:34.320\nSo I don't know, were you ambushed or did somebody urge you\n\n41:34.320 --> 41:35.320\nto do this?\n\n41:35.320 --> 41:37.040\nOr were you listening to Doug Love's movies?\n\n41:37.040 --> 41:38.040\nWhat was this?\n\n41:38.040 --> 41:41.200\nNo one heard it and then he's actually working on the podcast\n\n41:41.200 --> 41:42.200\nI'm working on.\n\n41:42.200 --> 41:43.880\nSo he's like, you should listen to it and then you should go on\n\n41:43.880 --> 41:45.640\nit.\n\n41:45.640 --> 41:48.880\nAnd then I listen to it and now I'm here.\n\n41:48.880 --> 41:51.120\nAll right.\n\n41:51.120 --> 41:52.120\nForgive me, Horatio.\n\n41:52.120 --> 41:53.920\nWhat is the name of your podcast?\n\n41:53.920 --> 41:54.920\nThe Horatio.\n\n41:54.920 --> 41:55.920\nAh.\n\n41:55.920 --> 41:59.600\nOh, I just got that.\n\n41:59.600 --> 42:00.600\nReal nice.\n\n42:00.600 --> 42:01.600\nYeah.\n\n42:01.600 --> 42:02.600\nI really did.\n\n42:02.600 --> 42:03.600\nA lot of people just get it.\n\n42:03.600 --> 42:04.600\nThat's why it's hard to find.\n\n42:04.600 --> 42:08.760\nBut it is the word hooray and then show and then at the end,\n\n42:08.760 --> 42:10.360\nyou know, you go, oh, I get it.\n\n42:10.360 --> 42:11.360\nHoratio.\n\n42:11.360 --> 42:12.360\nWait.\n\n42:12.360 --> 42:13.360\nNow I just got the show part.\n\n42:13.360 --> 42:14.360\nNo.\n\n42:14.360 --> 42:15.360\nA lot of levels.\n\n42:15.360 --> 42:16.360\nI'm working on a lot of levels.\n\n42:16.360 --> 42:18.440\nI thought the hooray was enough.\n\n42:18.440 --> 42:19.960\nOh, yeah?\n\n42:19.960 --> 42:21.760\nAnd then the last part is show.\n\n42:21.760 --> 42:23.720\nNo, it's like making your whole name.\n\n42:23.720 --> 42:24.720\nYeah.\n\n42:24.720 --> 42:26.720\nYou should do a podcast.\n\n42:26.720 --> 42:27.720\nI do.\n\n42:27.720 --> 42:28.720\nI do.\n\n42:28.720 --> 42:33.720\nAnd it's not on Ear Wolf as we were reminded by another associate\n\n42:33.720 --> 42:35.920\nof mine, Julia.\n\n42:35.920 --> 42:39.600\nBut you know, you can, I don't know if I'll get yelled at this,\n\n42:39.600 --> 42:41.360\nbut make them a Feral Audio podcast.\n\n42:41.360 --> 42:42.360\nOkay.\n\n42:42.360 --> 42:43.360\nGood.\n\n42:43.360 --> 42:44.360\nThere we go.\n\n42:44.360 --> 42:45.360\nThank you.\n\n42:45.360 --> 42:46.360\nWelcome to the Feral Audio Network.\n\n42:46.360 --> 42:47.360\nIt's, we have, we have.\n\n42:47.360 --> 42:49.400\nAre we just absorbing him right now?\n\n42:49.400 --> 42:51.240\nWe have a potluck every Thursday.\n\n42:51.240 --> 42:56.240\nThat's a little high maintenance, but like only, only if your, only if your downloads\n\n42:56.240 --> 43:00.360\nare below a certain number, are you actually expected to bring like potluck stuff?\n\n43:00.360 --> 43:03.440\nLike I, I just show up and fucking shit.\n\n43:03.440 --> 43:04.440\nLike Duncan Trussell makes.\n\n43:04.440 --> 43:11.040\nI'm like, what's this?\n\n43:11.040 --> 43:12.040\nSo, okay.\n\n43:12.040 --> 43:15.640\nSo I don't, I mean, there's a million things we can talk about.\n\n43:15.640 --> 43:18.840\nWell, we, we should really talk about the boat trip.\n\n43:18.840 --> 43:19.840\nThe boat trip.\n\n43:19.840 --> 43:20.840\nYeah.\n\n43:20.840 --> 43:23.320\nI mean, but I feel like, I feel like once we get there, it's going to be weird to segue\n\n43:23.320 --> 43:24.320\nout of it.\n\n43:24.320 --> 43:25.320\nSo I just.\n\n43:25.320 --> 43:26.320\nNo, no, it'll be fascinating.\n\n43:26.320 --> 43:27.320\nYou'll love it.\n\n43:27.320 --> 43:29.400\nI just do want to say one thing.\n\n43:29.400 --> 43:37.520\nI am here because they're releasing it on a criterion collection, a lot of cool audio\n\n43:37.520 --> 43:41.320\ncommentary with me and Cuba.\n\n43:41.320 --> 43:44.800\nWe have the ex-wife of Roger Moore, who's going to provide some commentary.\n\n43:44.800 --> 43:47.560\nSo it's all good.\n\n43:47.560 --> 43:49.600\nThe one other thing because I'm going to forget it.\n\n43:49.600 --> 43:50.600\nIf we start talking about boat trips.\n\n43:50.600 --> 43:56.280\nSo I just want to say the other piece of trivia is that you literally stole took.\n\n43:56.280 --> 43:59.160\nYou didn't steal because it didn't belong to me.\n\n43:59.160 --> 44:04.880\nYou were, you, it was down to me and you for the role of the Manny on, in the motherhood.\n\n44:04.880 --> 44:05.880\nYou won.\n\n44:05.880 --> 44:09.760\nI won the, I won the larger war.\n\n44:09.760 --> 44:10.760\nYeah.\n\n44:10.760 --> 44:11.760\nYeah.\n\n44:11.760 --> 44:16.200\nHow many, how many episodes did it run, but it was, it ran seven.\n\n44:16.200 --> 44:20.680\nIt was like, I somehow made it through this weird gauntlet of people that, that, that\n\n44:20.680 --> 44:25.560\nmust have been actually, I remember Besser was, was in some of the early auditions and\n\n44:25.560 --> 44:27.680\ncallbacks and stuff.\n\n44:27.680 --> 44:31.560\nAnd then I, and then I, I was like, wait, what, they're, I think I, I think I might\n\n44:31.560 --> 44:34.200\nbe like in the running and they just brought you in at the last minute.\n\n44:34.200 --> 44:35.560\nAnd then I was like, Oh God, they hate me.\n\n44:35.560 --> 44:36.560\nI'm fucked.\n\n44:36.560 --> 44:40.200\nCause, cause they were like, Oh, just, they, they, they, they thought of you and found you\n\n44:40.200 --> 44:41.200\nand brought you in.\n\n44:41.200 --> 44:44.680\nAnd it was obviously like, you had gotten the part because before that I was slipping\n\n44:44.680 --> 44:46.720\nthrough the cracks undetected.\n\n44:46.720 --> 44:52.960\nAnd then I saw you and I was like, Oh boy, they found a professional actor.\n\n44:52.960 --> 45:01.200\nNo, I remember, I remember that, that time I heard you were a great guy and, and, but\n\n45:01.200 --> 45:06.480\nI do remember that I felt that you were a little nervous.\n\n45:06.480 --> 45:07.480\nOh yeah.\n\n45:07.480 --> 45:12.920\nSo I kind of was like, okay, cause I didn't know who you were, but when you ever, whenever\n\n45:12.920 --> 45:17.680\nyou're getting into those situations, you're either the type of guy who thinks you can\n\n45:17.680 --> 45:20.000\ntwist the other guy around, right?\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:25.000\nOr you're the guy who's just like, uh, no, no games was, you know, and so I thought we\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:26.720\nactually were very pleasant to each other.\n\n45:26.720 --> 45:27.720\nOh yeah.\n\n45:27.720 --> 45:28.720\nSure.\n\n45:28.720 --> 45:31.200\nCause I will be in that, that I was like cool under fire, but I definitely was not going\n\n45:31.200 --> 45:36.080\nto be at the level where I'm like thinking of how I can psych Horatio Sansa of the part.\n\n45:36.080 --> 45:39.680\nI was, I was just like, yeah, I was just, yeah, playing, playing in simple nervous.\n\n45:39.680 --> 45:43.760\nAnd I really was like, I, I, I be, because I was like, you know what, he's right for\n\n45:43.760 --> 45:44.760\nthis part.\n\n45:44.760 --> 45:45.760\nHe's been on SNL.\n\n45:45.760 --> 45:46.760\nI'm done.\n\n45:46.760 --> 45:49.840\nLike I really thought I was going to like coast in under the radar because I'm, you know,\n\n45:49.840 --> 45:51.120\nI'm not, I'm not fishing for anything.\n\n45:51.120 --> 45:52.560\nI'm not, I'm not from that world.\n\n45:52.560 --> 45:53.560\nI'm not an actor.\n\n45:53.560 --> 45:57.840\nAnd I can't, I can't believe that, that world, that being an actor in particular, which is\n\n45:57.840 --> 46:01.600\none of the thousand things we could just talk about nothing else, this idea that you're in\n\n46:01.600 --> 46:04.600\ncharge of everything, but you control nothing.\n\n46:04.600 --> 46:11.080\nLike you, how do you deal with helplessness and the ego crushing like, do you keep a penny\n\n46:11.080 --> 46:16.000\nin your pocket and just press it into your palm or, uh, luckily I do a lot of improv.\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:20.840\nSo I get to kind of write my own stuff through, through improv.\n\n46:20.840 --> 46:25.560\nUh, so that kind of keeps you from going a little crazy, but, um, and now, now I'm at\n\n46:25.560 --> 46:28.880\na time where I don't have to take stuff if I don't really like it.\n\n46:28.880 --> 46:35.080\nSo, um, I do, I do well enough not to have to be homeless.\n\n46:35.080 --> 46:38.520\nYou're, you're, you're definitely, and this is where we can get, maybe I'll be prying\n\n46:38.520 --> 46:44.280\nor whatever, but, but what I've heard kind of the legend of you, you're, you're, you're\n\n46:44.280 --> 46:48.840\nactually born in, in, in Chile, but you're, you're, you're from Chicago and all the ways\n\n46:48.840 --> 46:53.280\nthat matter, including the fact that you were like a, you were a party guy, like you could,\n\n46:53.280 --> 46:58.000\nyou had a wooden leg or what do they call it, how a leg, you could, you could, you\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:01.920\ncould knock back the, the sauce like, yeah, yeah, I was really good.\n\n47:01.920 --> 47:02.920\nYeah.\n\n47:02.920 --> 47:08.000\nUm, and, and, and then you, and then you just, and then you quit and this, and it's not a\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:09.000\nfluke.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:14.600\nYou lost a hundred pounds and like you, you've credited it to, to changing that about your\n\n47:14.600 --> 47:16.040\nlifestyle and all that stuff.\n\n47:16.040 --> 47:20.160\nAnd like you look like you're 25 now and like, and it's been that way for a long time.\n\n47:20.160 --> 47:23.120\nSo I don't, I don't have to worry about me pointing that out, like knocking you off\n\n47:23.120 --> 47:24.120\nthe wagon.\n\n47:24.120 --> 47:25.120\nNo, no, no.\n\n47:25.120 --> 47:26.120\nYeah.\n\n47:26.120 --> 47:32.280\nIt is that it is a, it was that, and it's different, um, to, to go around and be, uh,\n\n47:32.280 --> 47:36.280\ndifferent looking, but it's, it's kind of great cause I think I'd be dead if I didn't\n\n47:36.280 --> 47:37.280\ndo it.\n\n47:37.280 --> 47:39.280\nDid you stop drinking?\n\n47:39.280 --> 47:40.880\nUh, like 10 years ago, I think.\n\n47:40.880 --> 47:41.880\nYeah.\n\n47:41.880 --> 47:44.120\nCause I think I've, I've been out like, we used to drink a lot.\n\n47:44.120 --> 47:45.120\nYeah.\n\n47:45.120 --> 47:46.120\nWe used to like rust, rust again days.\n\n47:46.120 --> 47:47.120\nYeah.\n\n47:47.120 --> 47:49.120\nYou used to carry a case.\n\n47:49.120 --> 47:50.120\nI did.\n\n47:50.120 --> 47:51.120\nI'm at the executor.\n\n47:51.120 --> 47:52.120\nYeah.\n\n47:52.120 --> 47:53.120\nYeah.\n\n47:53.120 --> 47:54.120\nYeah.\n\n47:54.120 --> 47:56.120\nHe had a case with, with shock glasses and absinthe.\n\n47:56.120 --> 47:57.120\nThis is cool.\n\n47:57.120 --> 48:00.560\nLike 1950s, 60s, like mad men kind of things.\n\n48:00.560 --> 48:01.560\nYeah.\n\n48:01.560 --> 48:05.000\nAnd you open up in their velvet line and there's little tumblers and ice spoons and whatnot\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:06.000\nand they're really groovy.\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:07.000\nReally cool.\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:10.880\nAnd the level of, like it's called the dipsomaniacs delight.\n\n48:10.880 --> 48:15.000\nThat's, that's, that's not one of the old ads for the executor.\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:16.000\nWhat is it?\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:19.200\nDipsomaniacs was out of the fifties word for alcoholic or what was the, I guess, is it,\n\n48:19.200 --> 48:20.200\nis it a drinker?\n\n48:20.200 --> 48:21.200\nYeah.\n\n48:21.200 --> 48:22.200\nYeah.\n\n48:22.200 --> 48:23.200\nA heavy drinker.\n\n48:23.200 --> 48:24.200\nA compotator.\n\n48:24.200 --> 48:28.640\nUm, are you, are you, are you, are you truly, truly like cold turkey sober or did you just\n\n48:28.640 --> 48:30.680\ngo like, okay, this isn't going to be my lifestyle anymore?\n\n48:30.680 --> 48:31.680\nIs there, is it possible?\n\n48:31.680 --> 48:36.080\nI, I went cold turkey and then I went to AA meetings for a while and, uh, and they were\n\n48:36.080 --> 48:41.520\nkind of fascinating because the characters were just, uh, insane, uh, really.\n\n48:41.520 --> 48:45.080\nAnd I kind of almost got addicted to going just to see the people tell their stories.\n\n48:45.080 --> 48:49.000\nCause, you know, they're always just like, and then, uh, when I was blowing that cop,\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:54.000\nI was like, enough, enough, you know, and I really had to take account of what I was\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:55.000\nup to.\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:56.000\nYeah.\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:57.000\nFucking good.\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:58.000\nYeah.\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:01.000\nAnd then there's this guy, this guy who, who talked like this, you know, and I'm not\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:02.000\ngoing to say anything about it.\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:03.800\nYou know, I just like, you know, I did it this girl.\n\n49:03.800 --> 49:04.800\nI'm not going to, yeah.\n\n49:04.800 --> 49:05.800\nHey, you know what?\n\n49:05.800 --> 49:06.800\nI hit her once.\n\n49:06.800 --> 49:07.800\nOkay.\n\n49:07.800 --> 49:08.800\nOkay.\n\n49:08.800 --> 49:09.800\nI got that.\n\n49:09.800 --> 49:11.800\nAnd then there's just like this fucking alcoholic is in there just talking about beating up\n\n49:11.800 --> 49:17.800\nladies and everybody's like, come on now, that's beyond being an alcoholic, just a fucking\n\n49:17.800 --> 49:18.800\nmaniac.\n\n49:18.800 --> 49:24.800\nUm, all right.\n\n49:24.800 --> 49:32.800\nSo boat trip, boat trip, let's go back because I want to get lost in this.\n\n49:32.800 --> 49:34.640\nAll right.\n\n49:34.640 --> 49:38.920\nSo let me just say right now, um, who wrote the film?\n\n49:38.920 --> 49:43.640\nI sometimes when I talk about this movie, there is a little pride in it and it also is a lot\n\n49:43.640 --> 49:44.640\nof shame.\n\n49:44.640 --> 49:48.040\nUh, and one thing I feel too right now is like, I start giving people's names out.\n\n49:48.040 --> 49:55.640\nIt's like, it's like the Nuremberg trials, you know, who else, who else was involved?\n\n49:55.640 --> 50:04.240\nUh, like your, your agents on the back, did you tell them that you changed agency?\n\n50:04.240 --> 50:05.240\nAnd in fact, I did.\n\n50:05.240 --> 50:13.720\nI know a couple of the writers are rumored to be hiding in Argentina to this day.\n\n50:13.720 --> 50:15.320\nVery, very nice guys.\n\n50:15.320 --> 50:22.040\nOne of them, um, the director was, um, a very nice man called Mort Nathan and he was kind\n\n50:22.040 --> 50:28.400\nof, he had rounded up a, a cadre of writers from, from where he worked, which was the\n\n50:28.400 --> 50:31.280\ngolden girls.\n\n50:31.280 --> 50:37.800\nSo the guy who writes for the golden girls, I'm like, well, golden girl's pretty good.\n\n50:37.800 --> 50:39.280\nMitch Hurwitz worked on golden girls.\n\n50:39.280 --> 50:40.280\nYeah.\n\n50:40.280 --> 50:41.280\nNo worries there.\n\n50:41.280 --> 50:43.280\nOh, and then, uh, keep a good junior.\n\n50:43.280 --> 50:46.720\nLike you had mentioned on the podcast, he'd won Oscar and then 30 seconds later made this\n\n50:46.720 --> 50:49.880\nmovie and sank his career.\n\n50:49.880 --> 50:52.680\nIt felt like for him, nine, nine movies came out at the same time.\n\n50:52.680 --> 50:57.840\nIt's almost like he somehow like the, the, like they rushed, uh, Jerry McGuire out or\n\n50:57.840 --> 51:03.000\nsomething and it actually was made, wait, I'm not, I'm not, I'm getting my timeline\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:04.000\nright.\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:07.440\nBut it was just weird cause it was like boat trip and talking dogs and like, like, like\n\n51:07.440 --> 51:11.600\nhe was a guy that found a genie in space and like, like it all came out like, um, it felt\n\n51:11.600 --> 51:13.440\nlike it came out a month after Jerry McGuire.\n\n51:13.440 --> 51:14.440\nAnyway.\n\n51:14.440 --> 51:15.440\nYeah.\n\n51:15.440 --> 51:21.000\nAnd I think, I think at that time after the Oscar, I think he had this thing where it's\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:24.320\nlike just wire $3 million into my bank account.\n\n51:24.320 --> 51:28.600\nAnd if it's there in the morning, I'll meet you in Italy and we'll make this movie.\n\n51:28.600 --> 51:30.880\nUm, it was that kind of thing.\n\n51:30.880 --> 51:36.160\nAnd to understand why you have to understand the tragic story of Cuba, good and senior.\n\n51:36.160 --> 51:37.160\nYeah.\n\n51:37.160 --> 51:40.440\nHe was a revolutionary.\n\n51:40.440 --> 51:42.680\nA lot of people call them Cuba batting.\n\n51:42.680 --> 51:52.000\nUh, that's how I heard his like, please do you, you keep talking please and no matter\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:58.240\nhow bad the story gets, it won't matter cause I'm using chicken, chicken, chicken times.\n\n51:58.240 --> 52:00.640\nUm, yeah.\n\n52:00.640 --> 52:10.120\nSo it was, I think the summer of, um, 99, I think maybe I remember having to, I remember\n\n52:10.120 --> 52:18.680\nI was asked to promote boat trip, um, a week after 9 11, um, they were like, just come on\n\n52:18.680 --> 52:19.680\nand take pictures.\n\n52:19.680 --> 52:22.240\nI'm like, dude, it's 9 12.\n\n52:22.240 --> 52:27.080\nI don't really want to be on a plane and I'm like, it's not that I'm afraid that right\n\n52:27.080 --> 52:31.360\nnow every plane is going to blow up, but I don't want to be in a plane thinking about\n\n52:31.360 --> 52:36.440\nthe fact that two days ago I saw the second tower collapse in lower Manhattan.\n\n52:36.440 --> 52:39.960\nUm, so that's just a little side note.\n\n52:39.960 --> 52:43.040\nUm, there was, there was a looming writer strike.\n\n52:43.040 --> 52:44.040\nDo you remember this?\n\n52:44.040 --> 52:45.040\nYeah.\n\n52:45.040 --> 52:46.040\nYes.\n\n52:46.040 --> 52:47.040\nSo you had already made the film or you had not made the film?\n\n52:47.040 --> 52:48.040\nI had not made the film.\n\n52:48.040 --> 52:49.040\nI'm going back.\n\n52:49.040 --> 52:53.920\nI had to promote it, but, but go back to whatever it was, 99, uh, there was going to be a writer\n\n52:53.920 --> 52:54.920\nstrike that summer.\n\n52:54.920 --> 52:58.280\nSo everybody was like, you got to do a movie, you got to do a movie.\n\n52:58.280 --> 53:01.520\nAnd this was one of those movies, one of those, you got to do a movie because they might\n\n53:01.520 --> 53:05.200\nnot make another movie for two years and you're going to be back in a cell and you can only\n\n53:05.200 --> 53:06.920\ndo it in this window.\n\n53:06.920 --> 53:13.280\nSo Cuba Gooding, uh, the script was pretty bad when I first read it, but I was told that\n\n53:13.280 --> 53:19.280\nI would be able to help rewrite it and I didn't get a chance to do that.\n\n53:19.280 --> 53:22.800\nUm, it's just not allowed to do that.\n\n53:22.800 --> 53:23.800\nIt's weird.\n\n53:23.800 --> 53:25.120\nSomeone in a show business kind of pulled a trick on me.\n\n53:25.120 --> 53:26.120\nI don't know.\n\n53:26.120 --> 53:27.120\nYeah.\n\n53:27.120 --> 53:31.000\nUm, we're just like, they just didn't even realize what they were saying.\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:36.080\nSometimes I feel like agents, I hesitate to say my agent who I've trusted for like almost\n\n53:36.080 --> 53:41.680\n20 years, but like all agents, like they, it's not that they're lying as much as it is.\n\n53:41.680 --> 53:46.760\nLike they just don't, their priorities are so skewed that they don't, they don't know\n\n53:46.760 --> 53:47.920\nthat they're lying.\n\n53:47.920 --> 53:50.440\nMaybe they don't, they don't want to think about them.\n\n53:50.440 --> 53:51.440\nYou're right.\n\n53:51.440 --> 53:52.440\nYeah.\n\n53:52.440 --> 53:55.160\nThey just, they are convinced when they tell you that the right thing to do is this or\n\n53:55.160 --> 53:56.160\nthat.\n\n53:56.160 --> 53:59.280\nLike they do, they, they, because they have lots of mythology to back them up.\n\n53:59.280 --> 54:03.640\nLike they're like, you know what, you know, who's picky about his roles, Hitler, I don't\n\n54:03.640 --> 54:04.640\nknow.\n\n54:04.640 --> 54:12.480\nLike they offered him a, he would have been like Johnny Weissmuller.\n\n54:12.480 --> 54:17.600\nThey were looking for a new Tarzan and Hitler passed because he thought it would be tacky.\n\n54:17.600 --> 54:18.600\nYou know what's tacky?\n\n54:18.600 --> 54:19.600\nKilling six million Jews.\n\n54:19.600 --> 54:20.600\nAbsolutely.\n\n54:20.600 --> 54:23.280\nSo anyways, are you enjoying the flat bread?\n\n54:23.280 --> 54:24.280\nI love this place.\n\n54:24.280 --> 54:25.280\nThat was, I'm sorry.\n\n54:25.280 --> 54:26.280\nI was in the scene.\n\n54:26.280 --> 54:27.280\nI was in the scene.\n\n54:27.280 --> 54:28.280\nI was, I was your agent.\n\n54:28.280 --> 54:29.280\nAre we set?\n\n54:29.280 --> 54:37.520\nMy space wreck was so good that a UCB guy was like lost.\n\n54:37.520 --> 54:41.600\nOr it was so bad that a professional professor was like, why are you do so good?\n\n54:41.600 --> 54:43.400\nI thought someone had flat bread over here.\n\n54:43.400 --> 54:44.760\nI'm like, that's, that's weird.\n\n54:44.760 --> 54:46.360\nThese guys are eating flat bread.\n\n54:46.360 --> 54:47.360\nAll right.\n\n54:47.360 --> 54:48.360\nSo sorry.\n\n54:48.360 --> 54:49.360\nI don't know why I keep interrupting.\n\n54:49.360 --> 54:51.160\nLike I'm like, they won't know it's my show.\n\n54:51.160 --> 54:53.040\nTell the story of boat trip.\n\n54:53.040 --> 54:55.640\nLet me shut the fuck up.\n\n54:55.640 --> 54:59.760\nSo I get a call and they're saying that, well, if you don't do it, Artie Lang is going to\n\n54:59.760 --> 55:01.160\ndo it.\n\n55:01.160 --> 55:04.440\nAnd, and then they're like, Roger Moore is in it.\n\n55:04.440 --> 55:06.320\nAnd I was like, fuck, I love Roger Moore.\n\n55:06.320 --> 55:09.600\nHe was my bond, you know, my age coincides with that bond.\n\n55:09.600 --> 55:13.760\nSo I'm like, I'll be able to do scenes with, with my bond.\n\n55:13.760 --> 55:21.280\nSo I, I slept on it and I had a dream where Abraham Lincoln, this is no lie.\n\n55:21.280 --> 55:33.160\nIn this dream, Abraham Lincoln says, um, don't do things for money.\n\n55:33.160 --> 55:34.320\nIt's all I ever did.\n\n55:34.320 --> 55:37.760\nNow I'm on two kinds of them.\n\n55:37.760 --> 55:44.600\nI, if I had held out, I jumped on the penny.\n\n55:44.600 --> 55:51.000\nI didn't know the $5 bill was going to get pitched to me.\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:52.560\nI said I wouldn't talk.\n\n55:52.560 --> 55:53.560\nNo, no, please do.\n\n55:53.560 --> 55:56.000\nCause there has to be funny things talked about.\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:57.880\nAbe Lincoln, Abe Lincoln said, don't do things for money.\n\n55:57.880 --> 56:01.520\nAnd that's your, that's your Abe Lincoln voice who's never been recorded.\n\n56:01.520 --> 56:06.640\nSo we don't know, but that's your, I prefer that it's not like, like, like, like, um,\n\n56:06.640 --> 56:09.640\nMinnie Mouse or something, you know, they say you had a high pitched.\n\n56:09.640 --> 56:10.640\nYeah.\n\n56:10.640 --> 56:11.640\nYeah.\n\n56:11.640 --> 56:12.640\nBut I want to talk to you.\n\n56:12.640 --> 56:13.640\nHe talked like David.\n\n56:13.640 --> 56:14.640\nNo.\n\n56:14.640 --> 56:16.800\nCan we talk to your Abe Lincoln just for a little bit more?\n\n56:16.800 --> 56:19.040\nI just want to like, like, I'm your roommate.\n\n56:19.040 --> 56:20.840\nLike, uh, I don't know how I worry.\n\n56:20.840 --> 56:27.280\nUh, listen Abe, the, um, the lint trap in the machine, the dryer fills up.\n\n56:27.280 --> 56:30.360\nSo after every load, you have to like clean it out.\n\n56:30.360 --> 56:36.400\nOh, that's good to make bedding, right?\n\n56:36.400 --> 56:38.520\nYou're from a more, you're from a more resourceful time.\n\n56:38.520 --> 56:39.520\nOh yeah.\n\n56:39.520 --> 56:40.520\nYeah.\n\n56:40.520 --> 56:46.400\nWe'd sleep two to a bed, um, you know, I'd prefer if we didn't, but I noticed you did\n\n56:46.400 --> 56:49.920\nlast night and I'm not homophobic.\n\n56:49.920 --> 56:53.200\nThere is another bedroom in the apartment for you.\n\n56:53.200 --> 56:54.200\nYeah.\n\n56:54.200 --> 56:55.200\nAnd I like it.\n\n56:55.200 --> 56:56.200\nI like it.\n\n56:56.200 --> 56:58.200\nI like that you're free about stuff.\n\n56:58.200 --> 56:59.200\nYeah.\n\n56:59.200 --> 57:02.640\nYou know, where I'm, where I'm from, slavery was cool.\n\n57:02.640 --> 57:03.640\nYeah.\n\n57:03.640 --> 57:09.400\nUm, oh, that's, uh, no, it's not, um, so things, you know, things change.\n\n57:09.400 --> 57:15.520\nSo I'm really, I'm really happy with like, you know, this gay marriage situation.\n\n57:15.520 --> 57:22.320\nWe couldn't dream of doing that when I was with old Mary Todd, you know, although I did\n\n57:22.320 --> 57:23.320\nkind of broke your heart.\n\n57:23.320 --> 57:26.320\nI must have kind of broke your heart when Horatio made that movie.\n\n57:26.320 --> 57:28.320\nOh, Lincoln.\n\n57:28.320 --> 57:29.320\nNo.\n\n57:29.320 --> 57:33.520\nAre we in the present right now?\n\n57:33.520 --> 57:34.520\nAre we back?\n\n57:34.520 --> 57:35.520\nAre we back?\n\n57:35.520 --> 57:37.880\nDidn't you, didn't you say you transported into Horatio Sands's dream last night and\n\n57:37.880 --> 57:39.840\nwarned him not to do things for money?\n\n57:39.840 --> 57:40.840\nAnd I read it.\n\n57:40.840 --> 57:42.000\nI just read the trades today.\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:43.200\nHe's he ignored me.\n\n57:43.200 --> 57:44.200\nHe's doing it.\n\n57:44.200 --> 57:50.400\nHe's doing a sex farce in Germany with German people.\n\n57:50.400 --> 57:54.800\nYou took, you took such, I've never seen you Abe in the, in the six months we've been living\n\n57:54.800 --> 58:00.440\ntogether, uh, since we met through Craigslist, uh, I've never seen you take such an active\n\n58:00.440 --> 58:03.040\ninterest in a modern, uh, American performer.\n\n58:03.040 --> 58:05.160\nLike I, I, uh, what was it about you and Horatio?\n\n58:05.160 --> 58:09.840\nWell, it's just the right time, you know, like, oh, I know he's from Illinois.\n\n58:09.840 --> 58:10.840\nI'm from Illinois.\n\n58:10.840 --> 58:11.840\nOh, that's one of this.\n\n58:11.840 --> 58:12.840\nYeah.\n\n58:12.840 --> 58:13.840\nYeah.\n\n58:13.840 --> 58:18.280\nAnd he was in some drunk Ambien haze and was like, uh, Lincoln, what should I do?\n\n58:18.280 --> 58:21.640\nI told him, I told him what I would do.\n\n58:21.640 --> 58:26.200\nSo, okay, okay, ending the, ending the scene, but because that's a really interesting concept.\n\n58:26.200 --> 58:30.200\nSo when this is because this is really actually true for what we understand of psychology,\n\n58:30.200 --> 58:32.840\nunless you believe the ghost of Lincoln came to your dream.\n\n58:32.840 --> 58:33.840\nI don't.\n\n58:33.840 --> 58:39.520\nThe funnier, the more, the more poetic truth is that in your mind, you saw my mind was\n\n58:39.520 --> 58:40.840\nfiguring it out for me.\n\n58:40.840 --> 58:41.840\nIt was doing it.\n\n58:41.840 --> 58:44.080\nYou conjured the icon of integrity.\n\n58:44.080 --> 58:45.080\nYeah.\n\n58:45.080 --> 58:46.080\nYeah.\n\n58:46.080 --> 58:53.120\nI wanted, I created this, this character in my brain to tell me in my sleep to not do\n\n58:53.120 --> 58:54.120\nthis movie.\n\n58:54.120 --> 59:02.600\nAnd I ignored it, but, but, but yeah, and I, I, I, I could spend the next half hour, uh,\n\n59:02.600 --> 59:06.880\nlike, you don't need to be left off the hook for that, right?\n\n59:06.880 --> 59:11.800\nLike, you don't feel, you don't feel like you made like a bad, like, do you feel bad\n\n59:11.800 --> 59:12.800\nabout it?\n\n59:12.800 --> 59:20.600\nI do feel, no, I feel bad about, uh, I feel bad that it's a joke, um, no, please, no.\n\n59:20.600 --> 59:25.320\nBut it was much like when I played a mariachi on Saturday Night Live, you know, I was like,\n\n59:25.320 --> 59:28.200\nit's okay because people see me in other things.\n\n59:28.200 --> 59:31.600\nSo boat trip has become okay because I've done many other things where I've been able\n\n59:31.600 --> 59:35.160\nto be funny and, and, and happy with what I did.\n\n59:35.160 --> 59:41.240\nUh, people still come up to me and tell me about boat trip, um, mostly Puerto Rican and\n\n59:41.240 --> 59:46.920\nblack people, um, in New York, they all love that movie.\n\n59:46.920 --> 59:55.080\nUm, and also when I went, um, I did a show in Iraq and, uh, and, uh, the soldiers told\n\n59:55.080 --> 59:58.120\nme that part of their welcome bag was boat trip.\n\n59:58.120 --> 01:00:05.920\nSo, so I have a lot of fans in Iraq and I signed a bunch of boat trip DVDs.\n\n01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:12.280\nUh, but that was kind of fitting also that I was in Iraq and just like seeing what a\n\n01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.200\nmess this whole fucking thing was.\n\n01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.200\nRight.\n\n01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:19.120\nBecause they were, you were there at 9-Eleven, saw the buildings collapsing and now you were\n\n01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:24.440\nin the boat trip of the, of the, of 9-Eleven, which is the Iraq war.\n\n01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.440\nYeah.\n\n01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:30.600\nThe, the, the result of the White House not listening to Abe Lincoln.\n\n01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:36.200\nAll of this was, if I had just listened to Abe Lincoln, there would be no terrorism.\n\n01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.200\nIt just, this was just a string of events that happened.\n\n01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.320\nOh wait, no, I don't know how you try, I didn't mean to imply that.\n\n01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:50.240\nI think you can correlate when I decided to do boat trip with the beginning of, of, of\n\n01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.040\nthe, of the terrorist planning.\n\n01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.040\nNo.\n\n01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:58.400\nUm, there's a lot of conspiracies about it, but Jeff, yes.\n\n01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.040\nAll right, so you, you say, yes, I'll do the movie.\n\n01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:06.440\nAnd uh, day one, like, how was, what, what was the vibe on the set?\n\n01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.520\nLike was it, did you, did you know?\n\n01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:11.400\nI knew pretty right away that it was, it was off.\n\n01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.400\nIt was, it was not working.\n\n01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.400\nYeah.\n\n01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:20.280\nUh, like I had to, I flew from, uh, from New York and had to be like there that morning.\n\n01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.000\nSo I didn't really sleep.\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.320\nAnd then it was just, uh, what, what I thought was going to be a thing where we can like\n\n01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.200\nlook at the script the night before and maybe work on some scenes was just like, we do two\n\n01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:35.280\ntakes, one for you and then one where you improvise.\n\n01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.640\nSo, so basically, uh, we know what, what I was told wasn't happening.\n\n01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.720\nSo it was very, very under the gun filmmaking.\n\n01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:48.640\nIt was a half the crew was German cause it was a half German production and they, and\n\n01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.840\nthey hated us and we hated them.\n\n01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.400\nUm, and what else happened?\n\n01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.400\nWell, it's the scene cause I, uh, oh yeah, yeah.\n\n01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.400\nLet's talk about the scene.\n\n01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.000\nI want to know the scene when all the jizz flies out the portal and lands on, as it lands\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.400\non Roger Moore, who gets hit with the jizz?\n\n01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:08.400\nOh, his name is, there he is.\n\n01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.400\nSorry.\n\n01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.400\nI mean, it's been a while since we've seen him.\n\n01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.400\nYes, your honor.\n\n01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.400\nHold on a second.\n\n01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.400\nI'm peeking.\n\n01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.080\nAnd was he told he was in a jizz joke?\n\n01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.080\nHe knew.\n\n01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.080\nYes.\n\n01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.080\nBut something about Mary had a jizz joke.\n\n01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:26.640\nHe had a chance to say no, uh, they asked him if he wanted to be the guy that caught\n\n01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.640\nthe jizz.\n\n01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:32.160\nUh, Eleanor Rosenfeld came to him in a dream anyway.\n\n01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.280\nHe was one of the writers it was on.\n\n01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.720\nAnd so the porthole, the porthole scene, but rewinding because the, the reason he's coming\n\n01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:46.000\nout the porthole and you kids can rent this this week, um, the, if you haven't, if I'm\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:53.320\nnot mistaken, the reason Cuba is coming out the porthole is because he, this is the culmination\n\n01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:58.320\nof him pretending to be gay so that he can be close to this to Vivica Fox.\n\n01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.320\nIs that right?\n\n01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.320\nYes.\n\n01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.320\nAnd she starts eating a banana.\n\n01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.320\nShe starts eating the banana.\n\n01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.760\nSo the banana is the most important thing.\n\n01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:07.640\nIf a bus was coming through this wall before I got out of the way or pushed you out of\n\n01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.520\nthe way, I would go, but the banana.\n\n01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.520\nTell me about the banana.\n\n01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.520\nOkay.\n\n01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.520\nOh yeah.\n\n01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.520\nThe banana.\n\n01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.520\nBecause I don't want to die without it.\n\n01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:19.120\nI don't want to live without the banana in high death.\n\n01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:24.240\nWhen she's eating the banana, it appears, the banana is chiseled into the, I didn't\n\n01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.000\nknow this, but of a debt, well, you weren't even, you know, it weren't in that scene.\n\n01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.800\nAnd I do want to say like, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not saying this in like a, in a, I don't\n\n01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.800\nknow.\n\n01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.840\nI feel like there's a similar, we had Dana Carvey on the show who I was like at the time\n\n01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.640\ntaking out on this pitch and like, like he's amazing stuff and he, he expressed so much\n\n01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.440\nlike, there's a, there's a sad side to this, which has nothing to do with like whether\n\n01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.880\nor not, it's the, the, the idea that there's a human cost, the idea that you actually feel\n\n01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.280\nstill that you feel when people are like, that you feel like you, that, that, that,\n\n01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.760\nthat you, that you did something wrong or that you have a lower quality to your, your\n\n01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.760\nworth.\n\n01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.760\nYeah.\n\n01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.760\nA little bit.\n\n01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.760\nJust from a choice.\n\n01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.640\nAnybody might have, look at the, the reason the population of the earth is eight billion\n\n01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:11.800\nis because everybody makes bad choices with the most, the most important thing you could\n\n01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:16.800\never choose of all is whether or not you should fuck somebody and we have a 70% divorce rate.\n\n01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.640\nLike, like we, we don't like, like we're, we're human mistakes.\n\n01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.240\nYou can't know that's not your job to know you're an actor.\n\n01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.240\nWell, thank you.\n\n01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:29.240\nIt's not, it's not like a Horatio, Horatio Sands and Kuban Gooding are the, the, the,\n\n01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.800\nthe, the, those like you guys had a two man comedy trip and you're like, we want to make\n\n01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:33.800\nthis movie.\n\n01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:34.800\nRight.\n\n01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.800\nEven then that would have been amazing.\n\n01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800\nYeah.\n\n01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:40.920\nBut I feel like, you know, as a, as a comedian and someone who's a social critic, I guess\n\n01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:46.920\njust by, by, by being a comedian, you know, you, you, uh, you have to take your, you know,\n\n01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.080\nyou have to take your shots.\n\n01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:52.040\nLike I, I, I could, I would still like to tell people that I care about, like this sucks\n\n01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:57.000\nand this is why I don't like it, but it has made it a little difficult because that is\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000\nattached to me.\n\n01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.880\nSo in a way it's kind of humbled me in a way, um, which can't be bad.\n\n01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:03.880\nNo, no.\n\n01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:04.880\nThat could only be good.\n\n01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.880\nNo.\n\n01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:06.880\nAnd like you said, it is true.\n\n01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:07.880\nLike if that's what I really,\n\n01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:12.360\nLike nobody watching that movie blames you for any of what went wrong with that film.\n\n01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:13.360\nYou're fine in it.\n\n01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.360\nIt's just, it's the movies.\n\n01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.360\nIt's the culprit here.\n\n01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.200\nAnd so as you said, like the fact that the crew is half German, I mean, that's the, that's\n\n01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:23.080\nthe part where you start to go like, oh yeah, like, because that's how weird it feels.\n\n01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:28.760\nLike I said, like people, it's, it's, it's not like, geely, like it's, it's, it's, which\n\n01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:29.760\nI have never seen.\n\n01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.160\nSo why did I just shit all over that movie?\n\n01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:36.840\nBut I, it's a historically like, I, there's, there's stories of hubris behind, behind historically\n\n01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.440\nbad movies, movies of like so-and-so thought he was such king shit that he thought he'd\n\n01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.440\ndo this.\n\n01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:45.160\nThis was the first time director and now we know a half German crew.\n\n01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:53.800\nAnd, and, and we were shooting in, in Brussels as, we were shooting in Germany as LA.\n\n01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.160\nAnd then when we went on the boat trip, we actually did go on a boat.\n\n01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:02.080\nSo half, half the crew was, half the people on the boat were making this film and then\n\n01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:09.520\nthe other people didn't know, so, so they were really mad that, you know, we were shooting,\n\n01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.360\nyou know, in the, in the hot tub.\n\n01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:17.120\nWe were closing up the hot tub in the pool and they weren't really mad at us, but, but\n\n01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.680\nyou weren't, you weren't on set for the banana scene.\n\n01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.320\nDid you, I mean, what do you know about the banana?\n\n01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.240\nThe Vivica Fox is eating a banana.\n\n01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:29.000\nThe joke is that she's showing him how she, she's not actually showing him how she eats\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.520\na banana and it's ironically, like dick-sucking, she's showing him how she gives a blow job,\n\n01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.520\nright?\n\n01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.800\nShe's, she's demonstrating with a banana.\n\n01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.800\nYeah.\n\n01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.200\nThat's that, that thing in a date that happens when you're on a date and the woman starts\n\n01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.640\nshowing you how she would blow you on a piece of fruit.\n\n01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.080\nThis is something women do with gay men, too, all the time.\n\n01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.080\nIt's like, oh, you're gay.\n\n01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:55.400\nWell, let me just like rub my tits on you and talk about sucking dick and, um, like,\n\n01:06:55.400 --> 01:07:00.400\nthe, the, the, the, and, and, but the weirdest thing of all, like, like, which is why you\n\n01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:05.320\nshould never have to worry about the movie reflecting on you at all because it's surreal.\n\n01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:08.280\nThe whole movie from front to back is absolutely surreal.\n\n01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:12.440\nYou might as well just be in a Jackson Pollock painting, like waving, like, like, like, like,\n\n01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:16.480\nlike, like, like 10 years from now, we may find out this movie's good.\n\n01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.480\nThat's how fucking weird it is.\n\n01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:24.120\nUm, the, the, but, and one of the weird things about it is the banana that she's demonstrating\n\n01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:30.320\na filet show on in the, the, it cuts in close and she's like looking at, and for some reason,\n\n01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:39.040\nthe prop master has shaped the head of the banana into a, like, very faithful, like,\n\n01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.560\nlike, like helmet of a cock.\n\n01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:50.800\nSo the joke is that somehow God created these wonderful, uh, fruit and that the, the joke\n\n01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.280\nis that, look, it came out looking like a real dick.\n\n01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:57.640\nSo it's perfect.\n\n01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.200\nIt should be sucked on, but that's, but the, right?\n\n01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:04.320\nCause I don't, I actually, I don't really remember.\n\n01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.480\nIt's just such a weird thing to have.\n\n01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.480\nI've not watched it on HD.\n\n01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.880\nIt's such a strange afterthought.\n\n01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:13.280\nAnd then it's been so long since I've seen it, but my, my mind, then there's just a snowball\n\n01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:18.280\neffect of wild shit starts happening and he's like trying to keep it in his pants and sublimate\n\n01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:24.440\nhis hornyness and while she turns her back, he just unleashes what I recall as being like\n\n01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.280\na half a gallon of gum.\n\n01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:31.200\nWell, it was, if you want to know the truth, it was grosser than that cause it was a, not\n\n01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.840\na realistic amount, but like a bucket would have been then it would have taken you to\n\n01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:39.080\nDracula dead and loving it territory to be like, well, that's silly.\n\n01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:45.720\nNobody comes that much, but it was disgusting because he, he would thrust his hips out the\n\n01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:51.680\nport hole and goes, oh, and in my, in my, in my, in my memory for no reason, just because\n\n01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:53.200\nit seems like something that should happen.\n\n01:08:53.200 --> 01:09:00.200\nThe ship's horn goes, yeah, yeah, and then it cuts to outside and apparently the port\n\n01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:05.880\nhole is above people who are on deck enjoying the night air.\n\n01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:13.520\nAnd one of the actors has a semi realistic amount of pure white, thick, come sunscreen.\n\n01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.040\nYeah, well, it looks like sunscreen.\n\n01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.040\nIt really does.\n\n01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:21.720\nFalls on his face and then they make a joke like, like, oh, there's a bird out here.\n\n01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:27.040\nAnd the weird thing is, if you thought a bird shit on your face, you'd react almost the\n\n01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:31.040\nsame as if you knew a man came on your face.\n\n01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.600\nBut because it's come, the irony has to be there.\n\n01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:37.560\nSo they're like, oh, it's a bird, Ellie's darn birds, which you would never do if a\n\n01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:45.200\nbird shit on your face, and it was more like that silent film, like, whereas if you had\n\n01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:50.880\na gigantic load like that, it would feel like a snowball in your eye.\n\n01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:57.600\nAnd you'd be like, oh, I want to say, I know that the actor that it was, it wasn't Patrick,\n\n01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.600\nwas it?\n\n01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.600\nI think a friend of mine was in there.\n\n01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.600\nI can't think of who it was.\n\n01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:08.360\nHe was a second city actor who was there in the 70s, and he's, I'm sorry, I can't think\n\n01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.360\nof it.\n\n01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:13.440\nBut he wrote on Golden Girls with, so he was just a guy who was hanging out as an actor\n\n01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.760\nand they're like, hey, you want to do that part?\n\n01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:19.640\nHe's like, all right, fuckers, I'll do it, and then that's how it happened.\n\n01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.640\nThat's a good story.\n\n01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:24.320\nI was the guy that got the jizz on the head.\n\n01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:30.320\nAnd it must have been great to work with Roger Moore, because he's Roger Moore no matter\n\n01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.760\nwhat, and he was in that movie.\n\n01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:35.480\nYeah, he has that Bob Saget thing, where he just says filthy things all the time, just\n\n01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:42.480\nso that you don't think that he's the proper real James Bond.\n\n01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:49.120\nWhich you and I, the joke's on us, because we both thought Roger Moore was the real James\n\n01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:55.520\nBond, and then you grow up, like now we're looking back through the lens of all of our\n\n01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.600\nfriends who are aggregators of James Bond culture, and it's like, oh, Roger Moore was\n\n01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.680\nlike the Adam West of James Bond.\n\n01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.480\nBut you and I were like, that's James Bond.\n\n01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.200\nHe was the one in space.\n\n01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:09.520\nYou'd watch the Sean Connery ones, and you'd be like, ugh, I can't believe they let this\n\n01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:14.160\ngo on long enough to get their act together, with the duty to kill.\n\n01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.280\nSean Connery's not really funny in those films, right?\n\n01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.280\nHe's rye.\n\n01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:26.800\nThe movie's got increasingly campy with Roger Moore's influence, and he was the saint, right?\n\n01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:27.800\nYeah.\n\n01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:33.640\nThat's, Roger Moore is like, he's the guy who kind of coincided with the gadgets, right?\n\n01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:36.000\nMoreover, they had gadgets in the Sean Connery movie.\n\n01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.880\nI'm talking out of my ass.\n\n01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.880\nMatt Gorley, well, Matt Gorley is a guest, at least.\n\n01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:44.320\nThere was always gadgets in that bit, but they weren't just camp with Connery.\n\n01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:48.800\nHe cracked a lot of jokes and one-liners, and mostly about pussy and stuff.\n\n01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.800\nYeah.\n\n01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.800\nYeah, you'll eat pussy.\n\n01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.800\nWhat was it?\n\n01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.800\nI'm pussy galore.\n\n01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.800\nHe goes, I noticed.\n\n01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:58.800\nYeah, not...\n\n01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.800\nHow would he notice?\n\n01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:00.800\nThat's so clever.\n\n01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:01.800\nWhat does that fucking mean?\n\n01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:02.800\nAlso, not even...\n\n01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:05.800\nOh, pussy lips are sticking out of your pants.\n\n01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:06.800\nWhat?\n\n01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.800\nYou've got an enormous amount of pussy.\n\n01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:15.800\nYou have a truly gigantic pussy.\n\n01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.400\nThe funny thing would be if she called him on like, well, that's not very clever, and\n\n01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.800\nhe'd be like, either is your name.\n\n01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:25.800\nI'm, yes, ending on its level.\n\n01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:26.800\nPussy galore.\n\n01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.800\nYeah, I noticed.\n\n01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:31.800\nDon't make me fucking carry your weight.\n\n01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:36.800\nYou can't do better than pussy galore, and I'm supposed to be like, readal-tittle-doo.\n\n01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.800\nI'm supposed to like, 20, 23 skidoo.\n\n01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:45.800\nI'm supposed to either let that pass or come up with the world's best pussy galore joke.\n\n01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.800\nYeah.\n\n01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:49.800\nIt's not making me the bad guy in this conversation.\n\n01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:55.800\nYour name might as well be Bucket Suck-a-Dick.\n\n01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.800\nSo, yeah, I noticed.\n\n01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:58.800\nThat's what you get.\n\n01:12:58.800 --> 01:12:59.800\nI noticed.\n\n01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.800\nThat's what I've heard.\n\n01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.800\nMy name is Suck-a-Dick.\n\n01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.800\nBucket Suck-a-Dick.\n\n01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:09.800\nOkay.\n\n01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.800\nAll right.\n\n01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.800\nMy name's James Bond.\n\n01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.800\nLet's get to work.\n\n01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.800\nThere's the world's at stake, first of all.\n\n01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.800\nApparently, I don't know why.\n\n01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.800\nThe beginning scenes are always really confusing.\n\n01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.800\nI did Matt Gorley, and, oh, check out the guy's name on the podcast.\n\n01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:27.800\nIt's a Bond one.\n\n01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:28.800\nOh, he's a go-kill-me.\n\n01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:29.800\nJeremy Carter.\n\n01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:30.800\nNo, not Jeremy Carter.\n\n01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:31.800\nMatt Myra.\n\n01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:32.800\nThey do the, um...\n\n01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:33.800\nMatt Mira.\n\n01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.800\nYeah.\n\n01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.800\nAnd we did the podcast, and we did Man with the Golden Gun.\n\n01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.800\nAnd there was some straight-up woman beating in that movie.\n\n01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:40.800\nIt takes a really weird turn.\n\n01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.800\nHe just sort of boxing this chick around.\n\n01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.800\nIt's like, that's not sexy.\n\n01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.800\nAnd yet, just 23 years ago?\n\n01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.800\nSuper, super hot.\n\n01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:54.800\nThere was a...\n\n01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.800\nOh, never mind.\n\n01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.800\nI can't remember, and then I'll fumble around for it.\n\n01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.800\nSo, Horatio, so the movie is finished.\n\n01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.800\nHow long did it take to shoot the whole thing?\n\n01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:04.800\nThree months.\n\n01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:05.800\nThree months.\n\n01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.800\nAnd so, you...\n\n01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.800\nWas there a big screening, a big hu-ha?\n\n01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:10.800\nHollywood screening and all that?\n\n01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.800\nYeah, I think there was, like, around 9-11.\n\n01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.800\nLike, after...\n\n01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:16.800\nLike, this...\n\n01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.800\nI think this came out the spring of, uh...\n\n01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.800\nOkay.\n\n01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.800\n2002.\n\n01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.800\nThe world was ready for a laugh at that.\n\n01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:23.800\nThey wanted it.\n\n01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:24.800\nYeah.\n\n01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:31.800\nDid you approve of the idea of having the red carpet go right through Ground Zero?\n\n01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.800\nLike...\n\n01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:38.800\nI know a lot of people cited that as, like, one of the things that they were put off by.\n\n01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.800\nI was like, why does the red carpet have to go through the middle of Ground Zero and\n\n01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.800\nthen bank back around to a theater, which is, like, a mile away?\n\n01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.800\nYeah, they said that we're actually, like, doing construction stuff in there, and we're\n\n01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.800\nlike, please postpone construction.\n\n01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:55.800\nLet us have our premiere.\n\n01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.800\nThis is a celebration of New York.\n\n01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:05.800\nUh, you know, this country is the acceptance of the gay human beings, and, you know, it\n\n01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:09.800\nwas all about, like, yeah, about getting them back, is what I like to say, getting back\n\n01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:13.800\nthe Osamers that did that to us.\n\n01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:18.800\nCan you tell whether or not that movie is homophobic when you watch it through, like,\n\n01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.800\na 2015 lens?\n\n01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:22.800\nBecause I, like, I can't remember the last time I watched it, but it was, like...\n\n01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.800\nI know it was, like, in...\n\n01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:28.800\nWell, the guy who plays a gay guy is just so, like...\n\n01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:35.800\nHe's so out of hand gay that he's wearing, like, makeup and just, like, weird...\n\n01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.800\nYeah.\n\n01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.800\nLike, if he was doing a space show in the 60s, you know, that's how gay he is.\n\n01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:42.800\nI think I made the exact...\n\n01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.800\nI think that's the exact mistake I made on a community episode that was, like, early...\n\n01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:47.800\nLike, it was...\n\n01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.800\nI can't remember if it was...\n\n01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.800\nI think it was season three.\n\n01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:52.800\nAnd the...\n\n01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.800\nYeah, it was like...\n\n01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:54.800\nAnd it was like, we want...\n\n01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.800\nAt our heart, we were trying...\n\n01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:00.800\nWe wanted to tell a story about, like, worlds coming together and a bigot that stops being\n\n01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.800\na bigot because he actually learns these people are human beings, blah-blah-blah.\n\n01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:04.800\nThe...\n\n01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:05.800\nBlah-blah-blah.\n\n01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.800\nBlah-blah-blah.\n\n01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.800\nBlah-blah-blah.\n\n01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:08.800\nBlah-blah-blah.\n\n01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.800\nThis is the most honest thing I've ever said on the stage.\n\n01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:17.800\nYes, the truth is, I'm neither homophobic nor an advocate.\n\n01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.800\nI'm just a fucking narcissist.\n\n01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.800\nBlah-blah-blah.\n\n01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:26.800\nThat's the only honest thing I've ever said politically on the stage.\n\n01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:31.800\nBlah-blah-blah in reference to an entire, like, movement.\n\n01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:37.800\nBut the mistake that we made, that I didn't even notice we were making it because it's\n\n01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:42.800\na sitcom and it's a half hour alarm, was like, yeah, the gay people, they read as gay.\n\n01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.800\nAnd that was the mistake because it was part of the setup in the story sense.\n\n01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:50.800\nIt was like, well, once upon a time there was a bigot and the bigot is a cartoon of a bigot\n\n01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.800\nbecause it's a sitcom.\n\n01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:57.800\nAnd then just, you know, and what we accidentally did, because we weren't even thinking about\n\n01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:03.800\nit, we weren't trying to create dimensionalized gay characters on our show, we just weren't\n\n01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:09.800\nthinking about that being a failure if we didn't do that because we were just thinking,\n\n01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.800\nwe were just playing with tinker toys.\n\n01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.800\nOh, here's the bigot and here's the gay guy.\n\n01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:14.800\nWe're drobes here.\n\n01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:15.800\nHow should the gay guy dress?\n\n01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:16.800\nWell, guess what?\n\n01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:20.800\nOh, the castings here, who should we cast as the gay guy?\n\n01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:21.800\nThat guy.\n\n01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:28.800\nAnd it was all in the name of just sort of like, oh, the story will be effective if the ducks\n\n01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.800\nthat are teasing the ugly duckling read as ducks.\n\n01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.800\nAnd so they're beautiful.\n\n01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:39.800\nAnd the swans read as swans because it's hubris and what we found out is like, oh, shit,\n\n01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:45.800\nthe offensive thing, I guess, is like, there's a huge misstep that you could do.\n\n01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:49.800\nA huge misstep that you could do along the way that you're not even trying to do that\n\n01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:54.800\nactually cuts the same silhouette as bigotry, which is like, oh, you're just doing a caricature.\n\n01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.800\nI mean, I don't know why I'm explaining this.\n\n01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.800\nEveryone understands that part.\n\n01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:02.800\nWhat I'm explaining is that I didn't understand, you know, the way why I would do that, you\n\n01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:03.800\nknow.\n\n01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:10.800\nYeah, well, even as a comedian trying to make fun of gay people for just funny things that\n\n01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.800\nthey do, you have to be very careful.\n\n01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:19.800\nYou can't just say, so I think the mistake is that if you, we see the old caricature of\n\n01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:24.800\na gay person on TV in the 70s, which was like completely flaming shirt, open pink, you know,\n\n01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:30.800\ngold shoes, and then we'll think we're going to make fun of that by making that even more\n\n01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.800\nridiculous.\n\n01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:36.800\nI think that's another mistake people make is just making it super gay because see, we\n\n01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.800\nknow it's a joke, but in the same breath, you have this caricature.\n\n01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:45.800\nYeah, the idea that, I mean, I think the mistake is like, and that I realize now is that you\n\n01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:46.800\nhave to write up to every character.\n\n01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.800\nI don't know why I would violate that rule.\n\n01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:54.800\nLike Chevy Chase's character was like, he was, to me, he's a cartoonish because he's\n\n01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:59.800\nthis, you know, he's this crazy character, but I'm also always writing up to that character.\n\n01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:03.800\nAnd if a gay guy is like walking through the frame and he has five seconds to be gay and\n\n01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:09.800\nset up a story point, like it's the challenges on me, like to construct a story where, because\n\n01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:17.800\nif anybody's watching straight or gay, they're like, it's actually, I think the, I guess\n\n01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:25.800\nI'd summarize the mistake as being like writers tend to, we tend to, we forget that the whole\n\n01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:31.800\ngoal is a diversification, whether or not it's silliness or like, however ridiculous\n\n01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:38.800\nthe joke is or whatever, if it's in the medium of people watching it and listening to it,\n\n01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:44.800\nlike your end goal is that they believe it's real kind of, even a pie fight.\n\n01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.800\nSo it's like, that's funny that it's a pie fight because why would people fight with\n\n01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:48.800\npies?\n\n01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.800\nSo I believe they're people and I believe those are pies.\n\n01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:57.800\nLike, and so if you're, it's dangerous to like do social commentary of any kind, like\n\n01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:03.800\nyou have to rise up to that because now you're using people and groups of people as pies\n\n01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:07.800\nin a pie fight and you have to like, no, no, no, that needs to read as like actual believable\n\n01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:12.800\nmeringue or you're going to make people, because, because, because like they can see the tin\n\n01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.800\nhit the face of like those pie fight scenes.\n\n01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.800\nLike now I love my metaphor.\n\n01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.800\nThey're like, when it's like clearly just fucking whip topping and I hate when the pie\n\n01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.800\nfight, just a bunch of whipped cream.\n\n01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.800\nThat's, that's not a dish or shaving cream, even worse.\n\n01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:31.800\nWhen they make shaving cream and how much funnier is that to get hit with a real pie\n\n01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.800\nand how much funnier maybe would have, you know, there's a, there's nothing wrong with\n\n01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:40.800\nthe concept of, of, of, but there's nothing inherently offensive about, about, about that\n\n01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.800\nidea at all.\n\n01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:46.800\nIt would be, it could be like a masterpiece of whatever, you could say that about anything\n\n01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:47.800\nyou could say that about.\n\n01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:52.800\nWas there any backlash or like any reaction Horatio from gay community about boat trip?\n\n01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:56.800\nUm, I mean, positive or negative or indifferent?\n\n01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:01.800\nI don't think, I don't think they, I don't know, maybe, but I, I don't remember.\n\n01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.800\nThere was never like a big stink up.\n\n01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.800\nNo, cause the heart was in the right place.\n\n01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:12.800\nMy character learned that gay people were human.\n\n01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:13.800\nYeah.\n\n01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:14.800\nHow did it wait?\n\n01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:15.800\nWhat was your character?\n\n01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:16.800\nHow does your character's arc end?\n\n01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:20.800\nDoes he, does he come out as gay or does he just, uh, accept the?\n\n01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:27.800\nI accept gays and I think, and I end up hooking up with this, uh, this woman who lives in,\n\n01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:34.800\nuh, in, in the hills in Sweden, uh, I find her and she's, uh, some sexy thing that for\n\n01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.800\nsome reason was, was there.\n\n01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.800\nSo I end up, it ends up okay for me.\n\n01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:45.080\nAnd in some indirect way that's a, that's a reward for you accepting gays is that you\n\n01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:47.800\nget to have a pure form of heterosexuality.\n\n01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:48.800\nExactly.\n\n01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:49.800\nYeah.\n\n01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:50.800\nYeah.\n\n01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.520\nCause there's like some kind of Swedish bikini team or something like literally lands\n\n01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.520\non the boat or something.\n\n01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:54.520\nYeah.\n\n01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:55.520\nNo, no.\n\n01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:03.880\nAnd then you get on a helicopter, um, with your cum, with, with the whole super cum is\n\n01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:09.520\nexplained in the first five minutes of the movie, and Cuba and I eat these weird, these\n\n01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:13.320\nweird, these weird donuts that have this stuff that we get super cum.\n\n01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:18.520\nThat's why this, no, uh, wait, where was I?\n\n01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:21.520\nWell, you were shooting down a helicopter.\n\n01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.440\nOh, I shot down a hot.\n\n01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.520\nI had forgotten that I shot this scene.\n\n01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:29.200\nSo when I saw this, I got really high and saw this movie like two years later after I\n\n01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:34.240\nmade it and I'm like, what?\n\n01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:38.040\nI shoot down a helicopter with a flare gun.\n\n01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:39.720\nHoly shit.\n\n01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:44.080\nI remember having to act like, okay, the helicopter is falling.\n\n01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:49.760\nThere's a, there's nine models inside the plane of the helicopter you just shot down.\n\n01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:50.760\nSo you don't know what you're going to do.\n\n01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:53.440\nOh, you know, you're going to get some help or you're going to jump in the water.\n\n01:22:53.440 --> 01:23:00.040\nAnd it was, uh, yeah, I just, it hit me pretty, pretty hard that I, I, I, I'd shot down a\n\n01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:04.760\nhelicopter in this comedy that we had made.\n\n01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:07.040\nThat was the bridge too far for you in that movie?\n\n01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:08.040\nYeah.\n\n01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:09.040\nYeah.\n\n01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.040\nI mean, if you watch that, you've all the believability goes up the window.\n\n01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:15.680\nIt was really at the edge of their seats.\n\n01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:17.560\nThey're like, wow, I hope these guys figure it out.\n\n01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:23.720\nAnd then after that, they're like, oh, what the hell, these guys are jokers.\n\n01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:28.000\nSo, so nowadays, and I guess this is where if, if it was like a single camera production,\n\n01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.120\nit would fade down and the Chiron would say life after boat trip.\n\n01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:36.360\nSo we talk, now we talk about, uh, current things.\n\n01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:39.080\nI don't, I thought that would be funnier.\n\n01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:47.440\nLike there would be piano keys playing after, after the boat trip.\n\n01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:52.920\nUh, but, but it's like that, that leaf Garrett interview from, uh, Hollywood, each, you Hollywood\n\n01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:53.920\nstory.\n\n01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:59.000\nUh, you guys know about leaf Garrett and he, he got drunk and, uh, and then him and his\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.160\nbuddy got in the car wreck and, uh, his buddy's paralyzed.\n\n01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.160\nRight.\n\n01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:07.920\nOh, and he, and so then he, he talks about it and he's like, I'm like, Paulie, I'm sorry\n\n01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.920\nman.\n\n01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.640\nI never forgive me.\n\n01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:16.920\nAnd then Paulie comes out and forgives him, but he looked so fucked up from like the days\n\n01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:22.120\nwhen he was a teen idol and then like, he had like a bandana covering cause his hair was\n\n01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:26.560\nlike probably half of it was gone or had been shaved by somebody.\n\n01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:27.560\nYeah.\n\n01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.560\nHe's pretty bald.\n\n01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.560\nYeah.\n\n01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:32.640\nSo, so yeah, that's that moment right now where I'm talking about shave his hair.\n\n01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.560\nI mean, it was probably, it probably fell out, right?\n\n01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:41.480\nWell, shave, like, like shave, like, like you're drugged out and someone's like, oh, you think\n\n01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:42.480\nhe was wearing it?\n\n01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:46.640\nLike, uh, you thought maybe cause as soon as I saw that, I was like, oh, it's just traditional,\n\n01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:50.000\nlike, like the guy from poison, whatever, you know, it's like that bandana thing.\n\n01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.600\nIt's just like, like the weirdest impulses.\n\n01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.080\nCan I get your take on, on the Trump's hair?\n\n01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:00.240\nCause I was researching today, I know it's a hack topic, but honestly, the more I read\n\n01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:05.680\nabout it, the more I'm confused, like that there's actually no consensus about what is\n\n01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:06.680\ngoing on.\n\n01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:12.920\nMy theory is that he has some strands in the back, maybe that he kind of like swirls, swirls\n\n01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:13.920\naround.\n\n01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:14.920\nYeah.\n\n01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:20.840\nIt's not, you might have, he might have a wig, but, um, at this point, at this point\n\n01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:25.320\nprobably it started as a swirl, now it's maybe a wig that looks just like it.\n\n01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.520\nHuh.\n\n01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:27.920\nThat's an interesting, okay.\n\n01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:30.560\nThat's similar to the double combover theory, right?\n\n01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.560\nYeah.\n\n01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.880\nI mean, I always thought, I always thought it was like accepted theory that I was always\n\n01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:39.200\nkind of boggled by that it was, it was a double combover, which that, that, that it was,\n\n01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.600\nthat it's from the side, like a traditional one.\n\n01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:45.840\nAnd then I guess from the back, like he has like, like riff-raff from, so it's like two\n\n01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.880\nweather forces coming together.\n\n01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.560\nAnd that's why it looks kind of like a basket.\n\n01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:55.080\nLike if you look closely, like, like, but, but it, but it all flies up as one if the\n\n01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:59.400\nwind touches it and, um, but he's not bald underneath that.\n\n01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:02.640\nI don't, I, I, that as far as I can tell, um, I don't know.\n\n01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.600\nI was researching it today because now I really want to know because of course he's our next\n\n01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:13.680\ncommander in chief and, uh, uh, watch out Ireland cause I love, I love the idea that\n\n01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.760\npeople in Ireland are like, I don't know if you've heard that my, my wife's in Ireland\n\n01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:20.880\nand they're like the, the people that she's talking to, the big thing that they keep coming\n\n01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:29.160\nback to is like, is I can't do an Irish accent, but and then, and then he tried, uh, is, is,\n\n01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:30.680\nis Donald Trump going to win?\n\n01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:34.600\nLike they're really, they really, cause they're, I guess that, that, that, that, that, that,\n\n01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:38.920\nI guess there's, I guess we feel like those days are now have been here and have gone\n\n01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:43.000\nthat idea that the world is worried that a maniac will be president of America.\n\n01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.800\nI was like, I was like, what, have they been paying attention for 38 years?\n\n01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:50.000\nLike, like, like what are they, what's their worst case scenario?\n\n01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.400\nYou know, do they really think there's still a button that works that's going to nuke Ireland?\n\n01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:58.840\nLike, like, like, I guess maybe some more realistic fear having to do with what the,\n\n01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:01.400\nour ability to collapse the entire world's economy.\n\n01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:05.920\nWhen they're done, like, like, like who, I don't want Donald Trump to be president,\n\n01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:09.840\nbut who gives a fuck like, like, like, like, like, like what would be the big difference\n\n01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:15.640\nbetween that and a fire hydrant behind that, that desk outside of Supreme court appointments,\n\n01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:19.040\nwhich Jeff's, Jeff's, Jeff's point is very well taken, that this, this next election\n\n01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.840\nis kind of important when a bipartisan sense that the Supreme court justices are going\n\n01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:28.840\nto get picked buzzkill because now when your friends, you know, when you're, you, you want\n\n01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:32.000\nto vote for Bernie Sanders right now and now over the next year, your friends are going\n\n01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.200\nto slowly one by one, they're going to turn and they're going to start, they're going\n\n01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.640\nto start ralph nadering you.\n\n01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:40.400\nYou don't know what that means because you're 25.\n\n01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.400\nIt hurts.\n\n01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:44.960\nI have bad memories.\n\n01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.600\nRoss Perot, 92.\n\n01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:53.760\nYour friends are going to change from third party advocates to fascist fucking bipartisan\n\n01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.800\nlittle robots because they're going to go, you're splitting them up.\n\n01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:01.640\nYou're voting for him, you're voting for the, you're voting, you might as well vote.\n\n01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.920\nAnd this isn't a female character, this is a male.\n\n01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:06.920\nI'm not sexist.\n\n01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:11.360\nAnd that was, and that was a difference in the election, right?\n\n01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.160\nIt sounded a little bit like Tay Brickston.\n\n01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:20.400\nWait, we don't have time to explain that.\n\n01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:26.520\nAll right, well, we usually give our guests two choices.\n\n01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:33.680\nYou can either have a double gulp or, no, you can, you can, why do I give them a choice\n\n01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:35.920\nbecause that puts them on the spot?\n\n01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:36.920\nThat's too late.\n\n01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:41.880\nYou can, you can, you can stay and we're going to play a role playing game called shadow\n\n01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:45.680\nrun where you, where you, you play a character, you don't have to know anything about it.\n\n01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.400\nYou're just going to be a guy in the far future.\n\n01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.040\nIt's like a cyberpunk kind of world.\n\n01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:56.560\nWe usually get about two feet of movement accomplished and it's all, all what it really\n\n01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:01.160\namounts to is a half hour of your time, not, not anything other than that.\n\n01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.600\nOr you can leave and we can plug whatever you want to plug and you can, you can, no,\n\n01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.600\nno, hang on.\n\n01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:06.600\nYeah.\n\n01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.600\nYeah.\n\n01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:08.600\nLet's bring out a Jamorge Brown.\n\n01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:09.600\nLet's bring out Jamorge.\n\n01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:10.600\nJamorge.\n\n01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:29.520\nI don't know if I'm reading this accurately, but I feel like there was audible reaction\n\n01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:33.720\nto DeMorge's sexy shirt.\n\n01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:48.400\nBachelorette number one, that shirt is fucking legit man, that is, every once in a while\n\n01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:53.440\nI go shopping and I go, that piece of whatever that is, I couldn't pull that off, but you\n\n01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.040\nlook great and that's a good, it's a good thing for you.\n\n01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:58.040\nThis will only make four people laugh that are not even in the audience.\n\n01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:59.760\nThey're watching on their laptops.\n\n01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:07.320\nWhen you pick that shirt in Borderlands 2, the video game, it's called Clever Girl.\n\n01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:10.320\nThat's the title of the shirt.\n\n01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:15.760\nThere's different armors in the game and they all have themes and it looks like a Jurassic\n\n01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:16.760\ncamouflage.\n\n01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:17.760\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:25.760\nClever Girl would be, oh, so that wasn't a real Borderlands 2 skin.\n\n01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:32.080\nThat was just, you're using Borderlands 2 as a springboard to make a Jurassic Park clothing\n\n01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:33.080\njoke?\n\n01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:34.080\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:39.520\nSee, again, it's like the Philharmonic thing from earlier, I'm still bothered by that.\n\n01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:40.520\nYou know what, guess what?\n\n01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:45.720\nI'm not a professional entertainer, he got my part of my ABC sitcom.\n\n01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:50.200\nI'm not a fucking entertainer, I told you, I saw him, I was like, oh great, I'm fucked.\n\n01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.760\nGuys, guys, guys, please, it's just a shirt.\n\n01:30:52.760 --> 01:31:01.440\nAnd I'm happy Boat Trip made you sad, because you know what, you made me sad.\n\n01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:04.440\nYou took my acting away.\n\n01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.440\nThat's why I'm here.\n\n01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:12.760\nThat's why you choked on your power.\n\n01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:20.120\nI hate our audience sometimes because they're so nice and then they ruin jokes sometimes\n\n01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:26.320\nby doing that aw, and it makes me, you know, yeah, yeah, how weird that you can conjure\n\n01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:28.920\nit artificially.\n\n01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:34.680\nIt's almost as if it means nothing when it happens every fucking time.\n\n01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:43.080\nYeah, the aw is hard to come back from, the aw, and you can still kind of, you can still\n\n01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:50.240\nget out.\n\n01:31:50.240 --> 01:32:00.560\nI'm not being condescending, everyone in the audience is a genius, the audiences can be\n\n01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:07.320\njust delightfully stupid because they're acting as one, that's what you want them to do.\n\n01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:17.960\nSee, that guy's a genius, if they all went, yup, that would be weird.\n\n01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:25.320\nIf you react by apologizing, which is what I always do, or like backpedaling or arguing,\n\n01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:26.760\nthey smell blood, right?\n\n01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:27.760\nIsn't that the idea?\n\n01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:30.040\nYou're not supposed to show fear.\n\n01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:36.200\nIf you go like, hey, there's a spaghetti, and then the N word, and then they go, whoa.\n\n01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:38.480\nAnd then you're just supposed to go, what are you supposed to do?\n\n01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:43.480\nLike Greg's group goes, walk it off, fuck faces, and then he just keeps moving.\n\n01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:48.280\nWe were in Yakima, Washington, and have I told the story before?\n\n01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:50.280\nWell maybe to me.\n\n01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:54.000\nWe were doing an improv show with like, you know, the Who's Aligned guys, me and Ryan\n\n01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000\nStiles and Chip Esson probably.\n\n01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.400\nAnd we were in Yakima, and Greg's coming out there, does the intro, and he's explaining\n\n01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.480\nhow improv works for people that don't know, and he's like, we're going to come to you\n\n01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:06.120\nfor our suggestions, so if I ask you for a name of a writer, you sir, you might say this,\n\n01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:09.800\nand if I ask you for a name of a thing, Matt of me might say that, and he said, and if\n\n01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:14.400\nyou sir, if I was, give me an activity that you would do around the crib, and the guy\n\n01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:18.720\njust kind of looks stare blank and goes, oh, I'm sorry, I forget where we are, sir, let's\n\n01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:23.640\nsay slang term for your domicile, like where you live, name an activity that you would\n\n01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:30.440\ndo around the trailer, and the crowd goes, oh, and Greg just goes, walk it off, Yakima.\n\n01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:36.520\nYeah, I don't know, it's Yakima.\n\n01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.360\nI'm not the walk it off Yakima kind of guy.\n\n01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:41.440\nNo, you know, Greg can get away with paddling the audience, and they kind of like it, but\n\n01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:42.440\nyou have to.\n\n01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:47.520\nI like to think, I like to think, I really like to think, and don't we all like to think\n\n01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:49.440\na bunch of dumb shit, that's not true.\n\n01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:53.920\nI like to think that the audience is endeared by my tendency to then go, well, wait, wait,\n\n01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:59.040\nwell, I didn't mean it that way, you know, and try, because I didn't, but then I'm also\n\n01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:03.120\nmad at them sometimes for going on, because they didn't even mean that.\n\n01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:07.800\nIt's weird how we do have a tendency to like, I noticed one time, here's a weird thing,\n\n01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:13.280\nthere's a legal term, silence is consent, but the word consent has taken on this whole,\n\n01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:18.400\nyou know, really, really powerful sizzling meaning of a really specific content.\n\n01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:23.400\nBut I remember two times in this podcast before I ever figured that out, I used the term silence\n\n01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:29.880\nis consent, which was just more of a reference to this like legal, like I was saying, meaning\n\n01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:33.720\nin the larger legal sense, that if you don't do, or philosophical sense, if you don't do\n\n01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:38.920\nsomething about something, then it's your, you're not, you don't get a pass necessarily.\n\n01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:42.240\nBut I think it's because of the word consent, because both times if you go back through\n\n01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:47.480\nthe archives, like I go, silence is consent, and I hear people go like, like an audible\n\n01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:53.360\nresponse from the crowd, as one, go like, oh, I was like, no, that's not, that's not\n\n01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:57.080\nthat, you, the word, because it's because of the word consent became part of a different\n\n01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:59.600\nfamily of language recently.\n\n01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.720\nWell, yeah, you're saying that, that date rape's okay as long as you don't talk.\n\n01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:08.360\nAs long as no one talks, it's all good.\n\n01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:17.360\nYeah, yeah, the phrase silence is consent applied to like our current conversations about consent,\n\n01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:23.720\nnot a great, not a great idea, like, like, but it's an, it's old, it's like platonic\n\n01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:28.200\nor something, it's like, it's, it's a, it's a concept.\n\n01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:34.200\nI think we got to the bottom of that.\n\n01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:36.120\nAnd then also, you know what I don't like?\n\n01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.120\nThere's silence.\n\n01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:40.680\nWhy not, why aren't they always laughing?\n\n01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.600\nOr applauding, or saying, I love you.\n\n01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:45.800\nYou just spent the last 15 minutes taking a big shit on them.\n\n01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:49.520\nWhy do they, why do they always have to either be quiet or reacting the way I don't want\n\n01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.520\nthem to?\n\n01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:55.760\nWhy can't they just react the way I want them to react?\n\n01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:59.560\nMy name is Slam Charisma.\n\n01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:06.720\nSee, I, I, I kind of feel bad because the stupidest thing is like Barton made that terrific\n\n01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:07.720\nnoise earlier on.\n\n01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:12.320\nSo, Harish, are you aware of Barton's awesome, magical laugh?\n\n01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:13.320\nNo, no.\n\n01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:14.320\nOh boy.\n\n01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.320\nCan you manufacture it?\n\n01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:19.320\nCan I, can I cue you and can you kind of do a fake version of it?\n\n01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:23.320\nTell me a garbanzo bean joke, Dan.\n\n01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:25.200\nOkay, okay.\n\n01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:28.320\nWhat's the difference between a garbanzo bean and a chickpea?\n\n01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:42.400\nHe doesn't even, he can't even wait for the punch line.\n\n01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:52.520\nLooks like Glenda the Goodwitch walking in on you while you're taking a shit.\n\n01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:58.760\nYou're like, you're like the world's happiest ghost.\n\n01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:02.280\nI've never heard him laugh.\n\n01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:03.280\nYou work with Barton, right?\n\n01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:04.280\nNo, I don't.\n\n01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:05.280\nOh.\n\n01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:07.400\nI, I didn't, I've never heard him laugh.\n\n01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.880\nOh, you called in.\n\n01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:10.880\nOkay.\n\n01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:12.880\nWell, thank you.\n\n01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:22.560\nOh, I thought you, I thought you guys were, I was just, what's the difference?\n\n01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:27.360\nI thought, I thought they were being, I thought they were being way gratuitously like labor\n\n01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:32.520\nlaw, like, like, because he was like, I called, I called in and you're like, oh, you called\n\n01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.520\nin and you're like, what's the difference, Harishio?\n\n01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:45.440\nAnd I was like, you're sorry, I guess, I guess, you know, he called but he was a guest\n\n01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:46.440\nand I didn't say anything about it.\n\n01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:47.440\nSorry.\n\n01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:51.120\nI'm just a fucking animal because I have on a phone.\n\n01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:52.520\nThe opposite should be true.\n\n01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:56.440\nYou can have an animal on your show that Johnny Carson ever have a chimp call in.\n\n01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:02.920\nI can't name the times he had one right on on a tricycle.\n\n01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:09.080\nGuest is a pirate for some reason, I guess, because Dan, what's the difference between\n\n01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:11.520\na garbanzo bean and a chickpea?\n\n01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.920\nThe difference between a garbanzo bean and a chickpea.\n\n01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:15.600\nYou can't just say that.\n\n01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:18.920\nOkay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, just fucking stop it because you're part of the problem.\n\n01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:21.400\nWe were in New York.\n\n01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:25.240\nI told this joke on this, do we talk about this last time when we were shooting this\n\n01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:32.320\nlittle pilot that Dan and Dina were doing, we, we were kind of like kind of just joking\n\n01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:37.000\nwith the audience, kind of keeping warm between the stuff and I went out and told this garbanzo\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:43.120\nbean joke and I got this big laugh and then Dino was just drunk, drunk, comes like stinking\n\n01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:47.000\ndrunk, comes running up like in front of the cameras with a script in his hand.\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.520\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, you fucked up, you told it wrong, you told it wrong and he tells\n\n01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:55.840\nme the joke completely wrong in my ear and the whole audience just got it and totally\n\n01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:00.280\nloved it and then the next day we were laughing about that, we sat at a bar and I said, Dan,\n\n01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:06.000\ntry to tell the joke and I'm, I, it, it, how long, 15, 20 minutes it took?\n\n01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.800\nYeah, well, so now should we tell them what the joke is and then just explain?\n\n01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:12.200\nTell them the joke and then I'll tell them how you started your version.\n\n01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:16.560\nOkay, so should I be the one to try to tell them the garbanzo bean joke?\n\n01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:17.560\nRight now?\n\n01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:18.560\nI think I can do it.\n\n01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.560\nDo it.\n\n01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:20.560\nOkay.\n\n01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:21.560\nTwo lines.\n\n01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.560\nTake it from the top.\n\n01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:23.560\nMartin, get ready, get ready with your mouth.\n\n01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:26.200\nDo you understand that you've never done this under this kind of pressure?\n\n01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:27.200\nYeah.\n\n01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:30.320\nThe bad at telling jokes is the, is the big joke.\n\n01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:31.320\nMe too.\n\n01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:32.320\nOh.\n\n01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:40.960\nWhoa, whoa, you can't, you just talk shit about Oz if you fucking awe him.\n\n01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:43.480\nThat was, that was a very different kind of Oz.\n\n01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:44.480\nHow do we know?\n\n01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.480\nHow do we, what's the difference?\n\n01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:56.800\nThat was a, now we're just, all right, now we're just, all right, all right, all right.\n\n01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:01.560\nWhat's the difference between a garbanzo bean and a chickpea?\n\n01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:13.920\nI don't pay $200 to have a garbanzo bean in my mouth.\n\n01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:19.440\nOutta boy.\n\n01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:22.320\nTime flies like a soup, but banana flies like an arrow.\n\n01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.600\nOkay, so.\n\n01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:26.960\nFruit flies like an arrow, but fruit flies like a banana.\n\n01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:30.200\nYeah, I'm sure all these jokes have their little codes.\n\n01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:34.920\nIt's, it's called the order of the words to make them funny.\n\n01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:35.920\nOkay.\n\n01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:39.520\nSo Dan, so we're doing it and we're like, Dan, try to tell the joke and we're at this\n\n01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:43.520\nbar in the afternoon, getting, they're getting ready to leave town and Dan goes, okay, okay,\n\n01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:44.520\nokay, okay, I'm gonna get it.\n\n01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:45.520\nI'm gonna get it.\n\n01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:46.520\nAll right, so, all right.\n\n01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:52.360\nLook as we're, again, to emphasize the irony is that we're mocking Dino because Dino got\n\n01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:53.360\nthe joke wrong.\n\n01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:58.560\nHe comes up in my ear and he goes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it has to be a girl garbanzo\n\n01:40:58.560 --> 01:40:59.560\nbean.\n\n01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:00.560\nYeah.\n\n01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:01.560\nI'm like.\n\n01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:02.560\nThat's, it's crazy.\n\n01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.200\nLike, so that's, that's what we're laughing about.\n\n01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:05.200\nHe's a little fun fact.\n\n01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.120\nHe told me this joke.\n\n01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:12.040\nSo we're, so we're, so we're, so we're, so even though he heard the laugh, he heard the\n\n01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:13.040\njoke where he came out.\n\n01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.040\nSo we're mocking Dino for making that decision.\n\n01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:16.200\nWe're like, what are you doing with it?\n\n01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:20.560\nAnd then Jeff passed his, I love watching Dan try to tell a joke.\n\n01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:21.560\nAnd so he goes, okay.\n\n01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:26.400\nSo a guy walks in to a prostitutes office.\n\n01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:28.360\nAnd I really thought that's the thing.\n\n01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:32.440\nA prostitutes office.\n\n01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.440\nI forgot that there was such a thing as this.\n\n01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:41.280\nAnd he said, I would like a sexual encounter with, with, with a lagoon or, what kind of\n\n01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:43.800\nbeans do you have, guys?\n\n01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:45.480\nI know that there's two beans.\n\n01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.480\nOkay.\n\n01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:48.480\nSo we're like prostitutes office.\n\n01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:49.480\nI guess, okay.\n\n01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:53.440\nThe office isn't important, the guy, the guy, there's a guy, there's a guy, he's in a desert\n\n01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:59.040\nand there's another, and he walks up to another guy and the guy says, I have two kinds of\n\n01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:00.040\nbeans.\n\n01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:02.640\nI got, Dan, this is a two line joke.\n\n01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:05.560\nYou're like, fuck, fuck, fuck.\n\n01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:09.080\nAnd so you tried for ever and ever and ever and ever to try to, okay, how can you be a\n\n01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:10.080\ntwo line joke?\n\n01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:11.080\nHow can it be a two line joke?\n\n01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:12.680\nAnd the answer is because you're the guy.\n\n01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:14.520\nI forgot that that's possible in a joke.\n\n01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:15.800\nYou could just be the guy.\n\n01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:16.800\nYou could just.\n\n01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:21.240\nSo he, so he finally gives up and he's like, okay, how does the guy go, what's the difference\n\n01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:22.240\nthat you fucking died?\n\n01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.240\nI was like, oh my God.\n\n01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:24.240\nIt's a riddle.\n\n01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:25.240\nYeah.\n\n01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:26.240\nIt's a riddle.\n\n01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:29.080\nWhat have I got in my pockets?\n\n01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:33.960\nWhich by the way, I'm sure we all agree Bilbo's being kind of a asshole, right?\n\n01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:35.440\nIn that riddle competition.\n\n01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:38.760\nYeah, it's definitely cheated.\n\n01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:39.760\nWhat have I got in my pocket?\n\n01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:40.760\nIt's not a riddle.\n\n01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:47.480\nAnd that, you know, on another episode and please tell your friends to come for when\n\n01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:48.480\nwe talk about it.\n\n01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:52.640\nI'd really like to talk about, you know, what, what, what goes into when does Sauron decide\n\n01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:54.200\nthat a ring gets to get lost?\n\n01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:55.200\nIt's fucking dumb.\n\n01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:56.200\nOh yeah.\n\n01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:01.680\nJust, just decide that the ring can roll down a hill and take over the world then.\n\n01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:06.040\nI don't like the magic in the Tolkien universe.\n\n01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.040\nYeah.\n\n01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:10.720\nWe don't like the magic in the Tolkien universe.\n\n01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:14.880\nWe think it's too spiritual and not rule driven enough.\n\n01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:15.880\nPlot magic.\n\n01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:16.880\nIt's bullshit.\n\n01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:17.880\nYou know what's exciting?\n\n01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:18.880\nJackie Chan beating someone up.\n\n01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:19.880\nYou know why?\n\n01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:22.720\nBecause you can see what the rules of a shopping cart are and why it's weird to use it as\n\n01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:23.720\na weapon.\n\n01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:30.600\nIf two old guys are fighting with spells, it's like I want to know what their mana levels\n\n01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:31.600\nare depleted.\n\n01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.600\nYou know?\n\n01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.080\nAnd what's the rules?\n\n01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:35.080\nYou know?\n\n01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:36.080\nLike, like, knock, knock.\n\n01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:37.080\nWho's there?\n\n01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.240\nAnd then it's like, weren't you glad I didn't say banana?\n\n01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.600\nAnd you're like, that's clever.\n\n01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:45.360\nHe did magic better than the other guy, or he knows more spells, or he had a secret\n\n01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:50.680\nspell button in his pocket, or, just give me the, give me the, give me the shit that\n\n01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:51.680\nI came for.\n\n01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:52.680\nTolkien?\n\n01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:58.160\nYou'll never defeat me, Sauriman, for I have a magical spell button in my pocket.\n\n01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.000\nIt's a nice.\n\n01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.720\nI think it's funny.\n\n01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:11.360\nNow, a single person in this room has reacted to me the right way tonight.\n\n01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.360\nExcept for Barton.\n\n01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:25.840\nAnd I, and I, I just, I just turn into, I don't know, Charlie Rose, what would I, what\n\n01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:28.400\nwould I turn into if you melted my evil away?\n\n01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:29.400\nJohn Stuart?\n\n01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:35.000\nJust a, just a beautiful little baby.\n\n01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:45.440\nI am a, I'm a, I'm a big ugly baby.\n\n01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:50.720\nI think there would be a, a handsome efficient skeleton underneath me, if, if all of my bad\n\n01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:55.040\nqualities melted away, there'd be a little tiny, like one of those day of the dead, uh,\n\n01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.920\nMexican skeletons, like, uh, Fandango.\n\n01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:02.720\nI think if you stripped away all the stuff of the exterior, what we've come to recognize\n\n01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:05.920\nis just, you're excited that you'd just be made of all quartos.\n\n01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:09.400\nYou'd just be a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of little mini-quattos or whatever.\n\n01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:10.400\nAll right.\n\n01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:18.520\nWell, uh, I guess the title of tonight's show is bullying, uh, finding, yeah, well, you\n\n01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:22.280\nknow, there's that way, you can do it that way.\n\n01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:24.240\nI'm not stupid.\n\n01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:30.480\nI know the different kinds of punches from the, I'm not touching you, uh, all the way\n\n01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:34.960\nto the, to the, oh poor baby, or all punches.\n\n01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:35.960\nThe old soft boat.\n\n01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:40.480\nI don't know if you guys have heard this term, microaggression.\n\n01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:47.960\nThat's you guys, constantly, you're a macroaggression of little microaggressions.\n\n01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:54.600\nYeah, I hope, I hope you're expressing real pain.\n\n01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.720\nI meant, I meant it to hurt.\n\n01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:57.720\nBad people.\n\n01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:58.720\nAll right.\n\n01:45:58.720 -->

come up.\n\n01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:45.520\nHow are we doing like head count wise?\n\n01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:46.600\nI mean, I can never remember.\n\n01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:48.720\nI'm always, I'm always fine.\n\n01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:51.080\nI know you are, but sometimes that seems passive aggressive.\n\n01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:53.440\nWell, you know, I think that's your projection.\n\n01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:57.840\nYou know, that's just, uh, that's your, your dream or whatever.\n\n01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:59.840\nI think you're for agreements.\n\n01:46:59.840 -->

--> 01:47:17.280\nContrary to popular belief.\n\n01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:20.320\nAnd where can these people listen to that and purchase it?\n\n01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:23.240\nOn my band cat camp.\n\n01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:24.240\nKali Kazoo.bandcamp.com.\n\n01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:25.240\nAll right.\n\n01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:30.320\nYou, um, you kids are living in a world of more dots

01:47:38.520\nAlso, the, I don't know if we ever really set the record straight cause I think we were\n\n01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:43.600\ntalking about the, the Mickey Mouse hands and I think we kind of made you sound racist\n\n01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:45.080\nfor me when we talked about that.\n\n01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:49.480\nYou misquoted me or you, I mean, you kind of said it, but then you, you, you backstep.\n\n01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:52.440\nI just, I just made a, you guys were talking about cartoon gloves.\n\n01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:54.360\nI'm an animator, by the way.\n\n01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:55.360\nYay.\n\n01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:04.880\nSo I told Jeff when we were at the renaissance fair of all places that, uh, you know, I\n\n01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:09.280\ncartoon gloves kind of have a history of being based off of what was one of the most popular\n\n01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:22.440\nforms of comedy long ago, which was minstrel, minstrel, minstrel shows, so like Mickey\n\n01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:29.920\nMouse, Mickey Mouse and lots of other characters had white cartoon gloves, which also served\n\n01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:30.920\nthe purposes.\n\n01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:32.640\nIt's in black and white and it's a contrast thing.\n\n01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:36.800\nI mean, sometimes they didn't have gloves, but like, yeah, it's a, it's a minstrel show\n\n01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:37.800\nthing.\n\n01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:38.800\nReally?\n\n01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:39.800\nYeah.\n\n01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:40.800\nAnd, and, and minstrel shows, they had it.\n\n01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:44.800\nSo cause you know, people from far away could see what they were, you know, doing.\n\n01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:45.800\nBut yeah.\n\n01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:47.520\nAnd also there'd be stakes.\n\n01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:50.000\nJesus, there's a black guy in here.\n\n01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:54.320\nI mean, if you watch the early Mickey Mouse cartoons, they're, I mean, they're kind of\n\n01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:55.320\ninferring.\n\n01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:58.080\nHe's a, a certain.\n\n01:48:58.080 --> 01:48:59.080\nHe's black.\n\n01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:00.080\nWait, really?\n\n01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:01.080\nThey're implying Mickey Mouse is black?\n\n01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:02.080\nYeah.\n\n01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:06.600\nI mean, it's, it's, they're sort of imply some kind of like racist things.\n\n01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:11.280\nLike he's like, you know, getting drunk or doing whatever kind of crazy things.\n\n01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:12.280\nThey're kind of inferring.\n\n01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:13.280\nHuh.\n\n01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.280\nGoofy's black.\n\n01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:15.280\nYeah.\n\n01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:16.280\nAnd goofy.\n\n01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:17.280\nGoofy's black?\n\n01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:21.200\nOr a dippy dog, which is his original name.\n\n01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:22.200\nYeah.\n\n01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:23.920\nI mean, there was a lot of that in cartoons.\n\n01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:25.640\nI mean, there was just a lot of that in comics.\n\n01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:26.640\nActive trickster figures.\n\n01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:31.360\nAnd there was this idea that you could, when you wanted them to not play to that effect,\n\n01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.080\nyou could do certain things to make them not play to that effect or surround them in situations\n\n01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:36.080\nso they didn't.\n\n01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:41.080\nBut then they did a lot of also like sort of, you can't get mad at a cartoon and everybody\n\n01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:42.080\nelse would just go crazy.\n\n01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:45.080\nAnd so they would throw the book at them and let them do a whole bunch of crazy shit.\n\n01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:49.640\nBut yeah, no, I mean, it was a different, it was a different time then.\n\n01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:57.120\nIf you guys are, if you guys want to see some real racist shit, check out the 11 band cartoons.\n\n01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:58.120\nThat shit's crazy.\n\n01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:00.000\nLike Cole Black and DeSubbin Dwarves.\n\n01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000\nOh yeah.\n\n01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.760\nI went down a rabbit hole and watched a bunch of old little rascals and some of those are\n\n01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:07.760\nshocking.\n\n01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:08.760\nThey went absolutely insane.\n\n01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:11.880\nHave you seen the one where they put on a play and it's Uncle Tom's Cabin, including\n\n01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:12.880\nthe whipping scene?\n\n01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:13.880\nOh yeah.\n\n01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:14.880\nYeah.\n\n01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:15.880\nWe watched that.\n\n01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:16.880\nThat was crazy.\n\n01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:17.880\nRob's place.\n\n01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:18.880\nDid we?\n\n01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:19.880\nYeah.\n\n01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:20.880\nYeah.\n\n01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:21.880\nMedina.\n\n01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:22.880\nYeah.\n\n01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:23.880\nRight.\n\n01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:24.880\nWow.\n\n01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:25.880\nOkay.\n\n01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:26.880\nSo speaking of progress.\n\n01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:34.320\nBecause the show isn't sexist, we let the lady choose which characters she wants to play,\n\n01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:39.920\neven though they're not both female characters, nailed it.\n\n01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:49.560\nIt's a combination of chivalry and total fucking like post-feminist ladies first.\n\n01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.800\nDo you want to play a dude or a girl?\n\n01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:53.200\nI'll be Aaron's character.\n\n01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:54.200\nOkay.\n\n01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:56.200\nI mean, I like what Aaron started.\n\n01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:59.480\nThis is going to be a great 10 minutes there.\n\n01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:02.880\nYou're the character created by Kumail Nanjiani.\n\n01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:03.880\nIs that Dr. Friend?\n\n01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:05.040\nI can't even keep track of.\n\n01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:06.040\nYeah.\n\n01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:07.040\nOkay.\n\n01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:10.600\nThis is like Dungeons and Dragons for a show, except in the future.\n\n01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:15.320\nAnd so you're a troll doctor who's going to let a troubled past.\n\n01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:18.880\nIf that doesn't make sense to you, those papers, don't worry about it.\n\n01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:19.880\nYeah.\n\n01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:21.480\nDoesn't make sense to anybody else.\n\n01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:22.480\nAll right.\n\n01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.480\nTime's wasting.\n\n01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:24.480\nSo let's start this off.\n\n01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:29.960\nWe're going to go back to the old days of the D&D spend.\n\n01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:32.920\nSo there's a recap at the beginning, and maybe your training will let you listen better\n\n01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:34.240\nthan I do.\n\n01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:39.960\nThis one was by Richard Clark, previously on Harmontown Shadow Run Time.\n\n01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:44.400\nOur heroes found themselves placed in the precarious position of dealing with a mysterious\n\n01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.480\nbrief beeping briefcase.\n\n01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:51.360\nThe noble Dr. Friend enveloped the potential threat with a force field only to find the\n\n01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:54.440\ngroup fleeing before his very eyes.\n\n01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:59.760\nFollowing the case, Horde Guard detected a horde of glowing creatures, the Damajoras\n\n01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:03.000\nof the infected souls who lurk in the shadows.\n\n01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:08.240\nAs Jim Nightblade sought refuge on a roof of a nearby building, the brave runners armed\n\n01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:10.680\nthemselves and charged into battle.\n\n01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:15.160\nAfter cracking wise, Jim Nightblade returned to the beeping case and opened it, only to\n\n01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:19.720\nfind a transponder that sends the infected horde into a rage.\n\n01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:21.640\nWill our heroes survive the night?\n\n01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:26.320\nWill a serial number on the device lead our protagonists on a ghoulish side quest?\n\n01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:27.320\nProbably not.\n\n01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:30.400\nWill Horde Guard make another poopy mid-battle?\n\n01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:35.080\nFind out on this week's Harmontown Shadow Run Time.\n\n01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:37.920\nThank you, Spencer.\n\n01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:38.920\nThank you.\n\n01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:39.920\nAll right.\n\n01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:40.920\nAre all the...\n\n01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:41.920\nI never listened.\n\n01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:42.920\nRichard Clark.\n\n01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:43.920\nRichard Clark.\n\n01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:44.920\nFake name.\n\n01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:47.000\nThanks, Richard.\n\n01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.200\nDid we kill all the trolls?\n\n01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:50.200\nGhouls.\n\n01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:51.200\nGhouls.\n\n01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:52.200\nNo.\n\n01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:53.200\nYou killed about four of them.\n\n01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:54.200\nMost of them ran away.\n\n01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:55.200\nRight.\n\n01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:57.880\nSo how many we got left?\n\n01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:58.880\nYou know.\n\n01:52:58.880 --> 01:52:59.880\nNone.\n\n01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:02.840\nI mean, there's none in your immediate area other than the one you just stunned.\n\n01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:10.280\nYou guys were more recently occupied with casting a group agony spell on a car.\n\n01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:11.280\nOh, that's right.\n\n01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:14.600\nYeah, I forgot about that.\n\n01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:16.440\nSo Richard, Richard kind of...\n\n01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:17.440\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:21.360\nNo, I mean, nothing happened that episode, so I used the last one.\n\n01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.360\nOh.\n\n01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:23.360\nYeah.\n\n01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:24.360\nAll right.\n\n01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:25.680\nAnd then they'd cast agony on a car.\n\n01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:26.680\nOkay.\n\n01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:27.680\nAll right.\n\n01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:28.680\nShadow Run.\n\n01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:29.680\nWe got to find that Johnson to screw this over.\n\n01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:32.040\nHe gave us a troll magnet and a briefcase, a ghoul magnet.\n\n01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:33.040\nGhoul.\n\n01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:37.560\nSo we all joined hands and we tried to combine our energy, and I did come out of the closet\n\n01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:38.560\nin my character.\n\n01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:39.560\nThe...\n\n01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:44.720\nYeah, we were trying to cast an agony spell on whoever.\n\n01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:45.720\nSo...\n\n01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:46.720\nWhich...\n\n01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:47.720\nWhich spell would that work?\n\n01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:53.680\nI mean, what happened is you all cast the spell on a car that's several miles away.\n\n01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:58.560\nSo if anything was going to happen, happened, or will happen, there's no way of knowing.\n\n01:53:58.560 --> 01:53:59.560\nAll right.\n\n01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:00.560\nCan't I...\n\n01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:02.880\nCan't I astrally project and see if that worked?\n\n01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:05.720\nYeah, but you'd have to find the car and you don't know where it is.\n\n01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:10.760\nOkay, I summon a sparrow.\n\n01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:11.760\nYou're too weak.\n\n01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:15.240\nYou just summoned a larger air spirit to do the...\n\n01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:17.000\nSit down, cross-legged.\n\n01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.000\nAll right.\n\n01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:28.120\nI would suggest to Dr. Friend that perhaps he applies some sort of healing to our weakened\n\n01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:29.600\nrun mate.\n\n01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:30.600\nDr. Friend, can you...\n\n01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:34.600\nCan you try to boost up my mana power level?\n\n01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:38.760\nYeah, man.\n\n01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:40.760\nI'm a woman.\n\n01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:41.760\nWhat's that?\n\n01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:42.760\nI'm a woman.\n\n01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:43.760\nI know, I'm blind.\n\n01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:47.920\nI just say, man, about everybody, you know?\n\n01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:48.920\nAll right, that's cool.\n\n01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:54.320\nI call my mom like, hey, man, can you make us some stew?\n\n01:54:54.320 --> 01:55:00.040\nTechnically, she's a girl and very sensitive, so...\n\n01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:01.960\nSo what do I do?\n\n01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:06.160\nLook through your spells in there and see if you've got something that can heal me.\n\n01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:07.160\nHe's got heal.\n\n01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:09.840\nOh, yeah, heal.\n\n01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:11.440\nSo I just say, yeah, let's do it.\n\n01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:12.440\nOkay.\n\n01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:14.040\nDo your magic.\n\n01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:17.520\nCast that spell, doctor.\n\n01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:19.720\nBest used after first aid is applied.\n\n01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:20.720\nThat's true.\n\n01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:26.120\nYeah, but they always say that, like, you're supposed to clean your ear out before you\n\n01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:27.120\nput drops in.\n\n01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:28.120\nThat's true.\n\n01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:29.800\nIt's like, give me a break.\n\n01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:31.720\nJust fix my ear, doc.\n\n01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:39.520\nSorry, I'm just doing some stand-up.\n\n01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:40.600\nSo I need to heal you.\n\n01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:41.600\nWhat's wrong with you?\n\n01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:45.200\nI just have low energy from casting too many spells of my own, and I'm kind of drained.\n\n01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:46.960\nOkay, so this should probably rhyme?\n\n01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:50.280\nYeah, yeah, I think all good spells should rhyme.\n\n01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.600\nTell me one more time what the problem is.\n\n01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:56.880\nI've drained my energy, my spiritual energy.\n\n01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:59.280\nI'm going to rhyme it with drain.\n\n01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:00.280\nOkay.\n\n01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:05.840\nHe's kind of like the peniteller of Spokastic.\n\n01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:08.960\nHe lets you in on the process.\n\n01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:16.760\nI sub in the spirits to clean the spells you have drained.\n\n01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:19.320\nI cast the spirits.\n\n01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:24.240\nSo wonderful to give you a power back that you'll feel rebrained.\n\n01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:25.240\nNice.\n\n01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:26.240\nHeel.\n\n01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:27.240\nThose are the spirits.\n\n01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:28.240\nThey're the spirits.\n\n01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:29.240\nHeel.\n\n01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:30.240\nIt sounds like booing.\n\n01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:31.240\nThose are spirits.\n\n01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:40.520\nDid it work, Spencer?\n\n01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:46.560\nLaying hands on Eve Libertine, magical energy surges forth, re-knitting your wounds and\n\n01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:47.560\nrefreshing your mind.\n\n01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:49.560\nBecause you know you're the Hayaku!\n\n01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:54.560\nI feel great.\n\n01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:57.720\nI cast the sparrow to go find the car.\n\n01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:03.000\nI summon a spirit animal with my spirit charm focus.\n\n01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.400\nHow strong?\n\n01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:05.600\nLevel five, Jackson.\n\n01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:06.600\nGee.\n\n01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:12.840\nYou're like one of these drunk people on St. Elsewhere that gets a new liver and then\n\n01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:13.840\nthey go to the bar.\n\n01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:16.120\nI don't know what to say, one of.\n\n01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:18.120\nThat was a story on St. Elsewhere.\n\n01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:21.280\nHey, that's the life of a magician.\n\n01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:25.480\nIf I die in the process of doing what I do, that's just the life I've chosen.\n\n01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:29.880\nI'd like to say one thing if I could to the group, okay?\n\n01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:35.240\nJust because I feel like a lot of what we did tonight, or this whole, I guess to us\n\n01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:39.720\nit's been tonight, but this has been going on for a while and I feel like we're bad\n\n01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:45.280\nshadow runners and we've had a bad shadow run.\n\n01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:53.600\nI've made a lot of bad decisions and we've got to chalk this one up as a failure, right?\n\n01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:55.920\nThey got away, they gave us a cool magnet instead of money.\n\n01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:56.920\nWe didn't get any money.\n\n01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:57.920\nRight.\n\n01:57:57.920 --> 01:57:58.920\nIt's not over till it's over.\n\n01:57:58.920 --> 01:57:59.920\nYeah.\n\n01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:00.920\nMy bird could still.\n\n01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:06.480\nHalf of the characters that we were supposed to either kidnap or protect are dead.\n\n01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:10.800\nWe just kept giving them to the bad guys and they kept killing them.\n\n01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:15.360\nThere's no lens through which we could be viewed as even anti-heroes because even anti-heroes\n\n01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:16.360\nare part hero.\n\n01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:18.880\nWe're like anti-neighbors maybe.\n\n01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:22.960\nAre you suggesting that we just drop this as it lies?\n\n01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:23.960\nYou know what?\n\n01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:24.960\nThis is the great thing about being a shadow runner.\n\n01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:29.760\nDo you think Banksy, like, dwells on, was like, oh, I spray painted that rat wrong.\n\n01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:32.200\nI should stop being Banksy.\n\n01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:35.560\nHe gets up and he tries again, you know?\n\n01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:40.240\nLike we just move on and we hope that this doesn't show up on our LinkedIn.\n\n01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:42.880\nSo you just want to start from scratch?\n\n01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.840\nNew Johnson, new shadow run?\n\n01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:46.240\nWell, we have to.\n\n01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:48.520\nThese people are going to pay us for anything else, aren't they?\n\n01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:50.040\nShould we not look for this car?\n\n01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:51.920\nBecause I have a photographic memory, apparently.\n\n01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:52.920\nOh yeah?\n\n01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:53.920\nYeah.\n\n01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:54.920\nI don't know.\n\n01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:56.520\nI don't know what happened before this.\n\n01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:57.520\nAh, shit.\n\n01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:58.520\nWell, maybe I'm doing it wrong again.\n\n01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:02.000\nWe did a job and the guy was supposed to pay us and instead of money in the briefcase,\n\n01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.880\nit was a transponder that brought a bunch of ghouls to kill us.\n\n01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:07.840\nSo he just completely hosed us and tried to whack us.\n\n01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:11.880\nAnd I'm saying, there's no harm in me sending up my bird to see what we see.\n\n01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:17.040\nBut we can, if you want to start looking for a clean sleigh, I'm with that too.\n\n01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:19.160\nBut there's also the possibility of revenge.\n\n01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:20.160\nOh yeah.\n\n01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:22.640\nI don't think we've seen the last of that asshole.\n\n01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:23.640\nI mean.\n\n01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:24.640\nNo, he means us taking revenge.\n\n01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:27.480\nI mean, we could just go on a killing spree at this point.\n\n01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:28.480\nWho cares?\n\n01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:30.600\nWell, because that doesn't pay anything.\n\n01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:31.600\nThat's my point.\n\n01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:36.280\nWe're supposed to be at worst mercenaries and at best, maybe a dark version of a hero\n\n01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:38.520\nin an unlikely context.\n\n01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:44.680\nWhat we have done in this Shadowrun is like, it's like we're some strange drunk animal\n\n01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:49.520\nthat just, and we've hurt people and ourselves and we've made less money than we could have\n\n01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:54.880\nmade and we've cost everyone their lives and we're standing here in the street, exhausted,\n\n01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:57.680\nalmost dead with a ghoul magnet.\n\n01:59:57.680 --> 01:59:59.680\nYou gotta let the ghoul magnet thing go, man.\n\n01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:00.840\nWell, no, it burns.\n\n02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:03.960\nIt fucking hurts, man, because the whole time I was thinking, just get that suitcase full\n\n02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:05.600\nof money and it's a fucking ghoul magnet.\n\n02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:07.200\nLike I feel, it's my fault.\n\n02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:08.200\nI feel like a piece of shit.\n\n02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:10.000\nI feel like a bad Shadowrunner.\n\n02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.120\nBut you have to be able to do as she said, let these things go.\n\n02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:18.720\nIf you want to cut bait, then emotionally, you must cut bait as well.\n\n02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:25.920\nThis is, of course, a world of shadows and running and chaos and the boundaries are imaginary\n\n02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:31.440\nor also constructed and you, again, you must do two things at once and do nothing at the\n\n02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:32.440\nsame time.\n\n02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:37.320\nIt's all about just sort of attacking and then not carrying too much water with you.\n\n02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:41.040\nLet's go forward if you're going to go forward, otherwise we turn tail.\n\n02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:44.640\nWe find this guy using what tools we have necessary.\n\n02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:49.040\nFind him and blast his fucking head off.\n\n02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:55.160\nAnd the currency, the currency, the currency I might suggest is the satisfaction of revenge.\n\n02:00:55.160 --> 02:01:01.480\nBlood is tasty when drunk and quenches thirst for years and years and then you go forward\n\n02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:03.480\nand then you make money.\n\n02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:04.480\nIf possible.\n\n02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:10.120\nOkay, but Cordegard, can I trust you to remind me why we're getting revenge?\n\n02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:13.200\nBecause it seems like almost we're the only ones that did anything wrong.\n\n02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:18.120\nOkay, but what I'm saying is if you're okay, well, first of all, a deal is a deal unless\n\n02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:19.680\na deal has not happened.\n\n02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:20.680\nRight, we want our money.\n\n02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:21.680\nWe want our money.\n\n02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:22.680\nWe want our fucking money.\n\n02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:23.680\nWe want our fucking money.\n\n02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:24.680\nHere's what I say.\n\n02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:25.680\nYou know what?\n\n02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:26.680\nI'm pissed about this.\n\n02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:27.680\nI'm going to send my little bird out.\n\n02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:28.680\nWe find him.\n\n02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:30.600\nI'm going to ask for the project, track that dude down.\n\n02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:36.640\nI'm going to summon the biggest orca in the world and just smash the whole fucking car.\n\n02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:45.440\nWhich is like the speech, no, the mainstay speech of the old, old, old, old high women\n\n02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:50.080\nor also adamant, which is your money or your life, you know?\n\n02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:51.080\nThat's it.\n\n02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:52.080\nIt's very simple.\n\n02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:53.080\nI mean, Cordegard's got a point.\n\n02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:54.080\nI'm with Cordegard.\n\n02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:56.280\nIf you have a photographic memory for Christ's sake, use it in three dimensions.\n\n02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:57.280\nSpin the car around.\n\n02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:58.280\nFind a license plate.\n\n02:01:58.280 --> 02:01:59.280\nIs that something we can roll in?\n\n02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:00.280\nFind a license plate.\n\n02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:01.280\nMy photographic memory?\n\n02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:02.280\nI mean, you have it.\n\n02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:04.720\nI'd like to talk to the other gay shadow runner, Dr. Friend.\n\n02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:05.720\nOkay.\n\n02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:06.720\nThank you.\n\n02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:15.880\nI just want to tell everyone that if your parents have had a trans-vaginal mesh situation,\n\n02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:23.000\nif there are attorneys now that you can contact, and several attorneys now that specialize in\n\n02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.680\ntrans-vaginal mesh detachments.\n\n02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:28.680\nWhat is that?\n\n02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:29.680\nWhat is that?\n\n02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:30.680\nWhat are you saying?\n\n02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:31.680\nWhat is that?\n\n02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:36.680\nWell, I guess it's something so that your organs don't fall out of your vagina, and\n\n02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:39.680\napparently what they're making this mesh out of is what they're...\n\n02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:41.440\nIs that something I should be concerned about?\n\n02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:43.680\nNot yet, but at some point.\n\n02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:44.680\nCliffhanger!\n\n02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:47.680\nThe Cliffhanger is Callie's 40th birthday.\n\n02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:48.680\nI don't know what...\n\n02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:49.680\n45th.\n\n02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:50.680\nNo.\n\n02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:51.680\nLet's thank Kali Kazoova coming up here.\n\n02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:52.680\nGo check out her new record.\n\n02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:53.680\nOkay.\n\n02:02:53.680 --> 02:03:03.680\nDeMorge Brown, Spencer Crittenden, Horatio Sands.\n\n02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:04.680\nThank you.\n\n02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:05.680\nWhat a treat.\n\n02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:06.680\nHoratio, thank you so much.\n\n02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:07.680\nGo check out his show, the Horatio.\n\n02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:08.680\nMaybe one day he'll be on Ferris.\n\n02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:09.680\nI'm Jeff Davis.\n\n02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:10.680\nOne more time for your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n02:03:10.680
