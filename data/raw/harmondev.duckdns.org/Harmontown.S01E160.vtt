00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
Let's bring out our Game Master, Mrs. Benster, Clayton Didgeridoo.

00:29.000 --> 00:47.000
Oh, yeah. And the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Thank you very much. That's very kind.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
Boy, Spencer and I almost didn't make it because we're starting at like $7.59. It's amazing.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
I made one comment in the green room yesterday because we were starting to load in at like $8.15.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
It was like, you know, that always happens. It's things gradually slip. People show up later, blah, blah, blah.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
And I made one comment about it. Somebody cracked the fucking whip. I think it was Dustin.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Dusty trails.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
I didn't want it to happen. I didn't want the whip to crack. I wanted the whip to gently like a jump rope.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
I wanted to go to $8.14 and then $8.13 because I was taking a shit.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Now I got what the kids call a turtle head.

01:34.000 --> 01:42.000
It's not true. The kids don't call it that. I do. And it's not true also. I took a huge shit at home before I came here.

01:42.000 --> 01:52.000
Okay, so speaking of positive changes, just for the asking. So last week we got our scoop, our ice scoop.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
But then you may have noticed. So Bobcat Goldthwaite's up here and he's talking about child molestation.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
And I'm using the ice scoops like...

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
It's very awkward and it's like, but I'll be damned if I'm going to not drink.

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
Are there little chicken feet? They look like little chicken feet.

02:15.000 --> 02:25.000
Not only are these tongs, which is better than a scoop, but the one drawback that a tong would have under a scoop would be the tongs you don't trust them.

02:25.000 --> 02:33.000
But even if just psychologically, the idea that these are chicken feet tongs, like I tested it backstage, it's amazing.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
I mean, you can blindly reach in and you'll come out with at least one cube. And it's not going anywhere.

02:39.000 --> 02:47.000
And it's quiet. It's child molestation conversation compatible to the year 2030.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
And we got that. So to give credit where credit is due, we just got that, you know, from Brandon.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I don't know if he wants his whole name said.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Sure.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
Brandon Lee, chill coat. Chill coat. Hello, Brandon here. I enjoy Harmontown and I've heard your plea for clean ice.

03:04.000 --> 03:12.000
I think he sent this before, you know, it raced and lost the scoop, but it beat the scoop.

03:12.000 --> 03:22.000
My girlfriend, Risa, and I hope to make it out to a show one day. You don't know her. She's in Niagara Falls.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
So please take this as a token of appreciation for less dirty and gross beverages.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Love it.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Thank you, Brandon.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
What else do we, if we could just ask, you know, let's positively visualize, like, what do we, let's clean this, our act up.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Like, what do we want?

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
I got a very civilized gift from a guy named Nick Gill who sent this from the UK.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
He's a playwright and author from London, I think London.

03:47.000 --> 03:55.000
And he's written an adaptation of The Trial by Kafka and the first character in it, Comptroller.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Did you know it's pronounced controller?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
It's pronounced controller.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Because we actually have one at Starburn Studios now.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
You do?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah, we have, it's like a real word in a real thing.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Fucking kick his ass, dude.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah, well.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Is it sex or there might be a girl?

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
Okay, so it could be a girl. Girls can be controllers.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
But I feel like they pronounce it right.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Why would you say, why would you spell it Comptroller?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
You're going to call it controller.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
It irritates me.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
I still have never looked it up.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I don't know what the word means.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
All right.

04:23.000 --> 04:31.000
So, so, well, for, okay, let's just speed, speed through the current events.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
Of course, a lot of people, for better or for worse, Jeff, get their news from this show.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
I think, I think it's, I think it's for better.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I think it's for better.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
So the Pokemon shootings were averted.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
Uh, there was a, there was a, there was a big Pokemon conference and the, and there were

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
two guys now.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Well, old champions.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Stop, stop, stop me when I'm wrong if you know what I'm wrong about the details.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
All right.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
But that there were two, two people who tweeted that they were going to tweeted a threat.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
There's social media warnings about these gentlemen.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Oh, social, oh, people on social media were warning about them because maybe they were

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
making creepy comments or something.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Something along those lines.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
At any rate, these guys got stopped before going into the convention and they searched

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
their car and they had like fucking assault rifles and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
There's a assault rifle and, and a shotgun.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
So there, I mean, unless there's more to it, and you know, I had spent five, five seconds

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
reading about it, but it appears to be a giant massacre.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
They were going to, they were going to blast up the Pokemon.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
The world championships, Jeff.

05:32.000 --> 05:40.000
And the, the scary thing about the, the article isn't the photo of the weapons in question

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
to me.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
That's because they just look like pictures of weapons.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
The scary thing to me is the photo of the, whether it's this year's or not, but just

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
the photo of what a Pokemon conference looks like.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
No, and I don't, I'm not teasing.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
I'm saying like it's a room.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
It's, it's, it's packed, you know, and it's just, it's the world championships.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
It's, it's, it would, it's, it's very.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
So there's regional Pokemon things that you climb your way up to make.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Well, yeah.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
I mean, you don't just start at the world championships.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
There's regionals.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
He got to be eight gym leaders.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
That might actually be true.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
So I've never, I've never played Pokemon.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Is it like a card kind of game?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Well, I mean, I didn't dig too deeply.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
There is a card game that I believe.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Yeah, that's still popular.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
And there's, you know, the video game that people play against.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
I bought, I bought.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
There you go.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Thanks.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
That's Steve Levy.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I bought, oh, is he here?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
He's in a research department, Steve.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
He loves Pokemon.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
I bought, I bought a Nintendo thing, the DS thing in New York because I, and I wanted

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
to get into Pokemon because it seems like, because you got to catch them all.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
From what I understand.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
And that, that appeals to my, when I, you know, I like the hoarding and the, you know,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
like I thought if you improve them and trade them and have them fight each other,

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
it's not like from what I've heard about Pokemon for 25 years.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
It sounds like a very unsafe thing to get into now.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Well, yeah.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Or it's, or the most safe ever now for the time being.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
But the scary thing about it was what a, what a murder spree friendly environment.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Like, I mean, I just, I just, yeah.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
What's that?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
It's cock fighting for children.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Oh, well, the game is cock fighting for children.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Yes.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
But I had moved back to the much more severe topic of those children getting shot in

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
the face.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
So, all right.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
So the Pokemon shootings were averted, which makes it okay to now go back to police bashing

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
because they really did their job there.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Obviously law enforcement at work at the Pokemon conference.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
Law enforcement a little less at work at LAX where Wiz Khalifa was handcuffed and slammed

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
to the floor.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
He wasn't resisting.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
He wasn't.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
Well, then why did they say, why did they keep saying stop resisting?

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
Why would police say that while kneeling on your back if you weren't, if they couldn't

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
tell, like a chiropractor can that you're, there's resistance going on.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
They can tell their knees are right on his shoulder blades.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
They know if there's resistance there.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
You got me there.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
But this guy's, I didn't realize, I was like, who's Wiz Khalifa?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
And I was all excited because listen to his name.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
It's like, it's more than just a rapper.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
It's like, wow, I'm into a guy named Wiz Khalifa.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Like, like he's super, super duper not white.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Like, like, like, like, he's covered in tattoos.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
And he's, and he's, and he's the, were you, were you watching that twins show with us

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
on VH1, that, that, that, that twin reality show thing?

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Anyways, the fact that the two white fat twins, the, the funniest thing was that they won

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
by, by, because their song was Weed'em Boys.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
And that's, that's Wiz Khalifa.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
I didn't, I didn't connect those dots.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
Weed'em Boys and the, and the song from Fast Furious.

08:46.000 --> 08:54.000
When you put in your baboon here and you put on your face and it's good to have seen you

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
but I'll see you again.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Yo, yo, yo, it seems I'm back in the day.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
It seems I'm back in the times and all the usual ways from, from around in the,

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
just one of those heartfelt kind of back in the day raps.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
It doesn't have to be as good a rap.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
I was, I was getting that vibe from that.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
I always wanted, I always wanted to do, it's like the quintessential one of those, but those come out every year.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
It started off with kind of like a Michael McDonald kind of, kind of Dubid,

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Dubid brothers kind of thing.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Yeah.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Can you, can you, can you do one?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Can you, can you sing with your dulcet tones?

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
And then so that I can do a back in the day, like rap?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
So what's, what's, what's, what do I have to accomplish with my part of it?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
You have to do like the hook.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
You have to be like the, you have to, you have to do like a, you have to say like,

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
I love your face and I love your chicken too.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Like, whatever.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Like, like, like I kind of like, like, like, like, like, like.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Is it about love or is it about?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
It's about love.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Or about missing people or.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
I love your face and your chicken too.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Give that chicken to me.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Yeah.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Yeah.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It seems like back in the day.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Oh, the chicken.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Are we recording this?

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
Justin, are we rolling?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Yeah.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
It seems like just the other day used to be so many ways in a different way.

10:16.000 --> 10:23.000
Used to be in the past, but now things have changed so much in the usual way.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I think we got, I think we got something good here.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
You know, you know, you know what it is, Jeff?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Too many.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Oh, this.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Okay.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
This.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Okay.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Phones tripping out.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Yeah.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Yeah.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
I was like, how do you turn that?

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
Triple finger double tap to two in the pink or what?

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
It's one on the app and two in the crap.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
No.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Now I'm just adding appointments.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Adding appointments everywhere.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I have nine.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Put it down.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
This is serious.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
This is a serious problem.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Zoom out.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Okay.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
He got it.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Okay.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
Well, I eventually hit the screen so much that it went into some kind of like this.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
This isn't a chimps cage mode.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
And it brought up a menu that a chimp could understand that the top thing was like zoom

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
out, return to your banana.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
All right.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
So anyway, so was, well, so was Khalifa is my new hero.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Cause he, he was in LAX and he wouldn't get off of his hoverboard.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
You, you rode one of those hoverboards.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
I've not.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
I'm, I'm, I've always around them or wrote the drawing room after the show and we're

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
drinking and it seems like a terrible idea to get on one of those drunk.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I've seen some people wipe the fuck out on those.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Oh, those, you're talking about those mini segue things.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
Yeah.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
Those, those, uh, what do you call this?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Yeah.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
It's a segue without a, without a handle.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Wiz Khalifa loves them and he, and he loves it so much.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
He was riding around LAX with them and the cops were like, you got to stop that.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
And he's like, why?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
No, I don't.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
And, and, and they're like, yeah, you do.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
And he's like, what are you going to arrest me for not doing what you say?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Awesome.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Good, good, good question.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
That's not against the law.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Fucking cops.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
What are you a judge?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Like there's no, what's the law?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
No hoverboard law?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
You can't go skateboarding around LAX.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
You drive little trucks all around the fucking LAX.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
And if you ever been to another airport.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Down the hallways.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
Like international airports, like Japanese, uh, uh, like, like, like business men, they

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
ride, fuck it.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
They have like scooters.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.200
They inspect your gadgets, roller skate shoes, and they have like crazy, like their luggage

12:27.200 --> 12:31.200
turns into a fucking like, like, uh, uh, a fucking wave runner.

12:31.200 --> 12:36.200
Like they, like, you're like, what the fuck am I in trouble?

12:36.200 --> 12:37.200
Is that Al-Qaeda?

12:37.200 --> 12:39.200
And they're like, no, that's a Japanese guy.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.200
He knows what he's doing.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.200
These are the passengers.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.200
This is not.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.200
Yeah, passengers.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.200
What the fuck?

12:45.200 --> 12:46.200
Yeah.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.200
I want to do that.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.200
So here's the thing about airports.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.200
Here's the thing about the TSA.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.200
Here's the thing about our panic.

12:50.200 --> 12:55.600
Here's the thing about going into these places and the religion being, don't, don't do anything

12:55.600 --> 12:57.240
weird, don't do anything wrong.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.800
I just want to say about that.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.600
Like we keep falling back on this hot button of like, oh, it must be so hard.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.040
And it's, oh, there's so many things at stake.

13:03.040 --> 13:08.200
Meanwhile, as we all learned for 10 years, we were worshiping at this altar and, you

13:08.200 --> 13:12.800
know, fine, like, like we were doing it for nothing because you could have had a gun in

13:12.800 --> 13:13.800
your hat.

13:13.800 --> 13:17.280
Like, like, like in 95% of them would have gotten through like, like they, they, they

13:17.280 --> 13:21.560
tested it and then there's still, so forget about that for a second.

13:21.560 --> 13:24.480
Just observe the fact that like, like it's a checkpoint.

13:24.480 --> 13:25.880
It's a security checkpoint.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.560
You know what's a really bad idea for security checkpoints?

13:28.560 --> 13:29.560
Like disruptability.

13:29.560 --> 13:34.400
Do you know what, do you know what all there is at that place is fucking ways that they

13:34.400 --> 13:36.480
tell you you can disrupt them.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.360
Like they're advertising about it.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.120
It's like, well, don't, don't make a, don't make the wrong comment.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.120
Don't make the wrong joke.

13:42.120 --> 13:45.160
Don't you motherfuckers have shit under control?

13:45.160 --> 13:48.280
Because if you do, I should be able to make a joke.

13:48.280 --> 13:49.280
Everyone should be able to.

13:49.280 --> 13:57.560
Be able to run into an airport with seven prop like dynamite vests on like one of those

13:57.560 --> 14:04.440
Michael Jackson, Venice beach things and be like, six of me are terrorists and they should

14:04.440 --> 14:08.320
be like, knock it off, sir.

14:08.320 --> 14:11.920
That's too big for the luggage rack.

14:11.920 --> 14:16.720
I bought extra seats and it's like, but you know, in the end, if I did, you know, if it's

14:16.720 --> 14:21.360
not, if the dogs don't bark or if I don't get a gray swab reading or what, have your

14:21.360 --> 14:22.360
draconian rules.

14:22.360 --> 14:26.400
I did something, well, the last trip I took, I guess when we were going to New York for

14:26.400 --> 14:32.960
Harmontown out there, I went into LAX and they said, I'm sir randomly, can you, can

14:32.960 --> 14:36.200
you put your palm out and they do like the, you know, the explosive residue test with

14:36.200 --> 14:38.920
a little, you know, a little ravioli looking little pieces of cloth.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.920
They do look like ravioli.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.400
Why, why, why is that?

14:42.400 --> 14:43.400
I don't know.

14:43.400 --> 14:47.080
Why does ravioli have to look like, like, like, have those little, little teeth around

14:47.080 --> 14:48.080
the edge?

14:48.080 --> 14:49.080
I think that's how you kind of crimp them together.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.080
You close them up that way.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.080
Like you take a fork and you crimp them.

14:51.080 --> 14:52.080
It's also stylish.

14:52.080 --> 14:55.280
That's the fastening system to keep a ravioli together, man.

14:55.280 --> 14:58.840
But then I wonder why that little, that little swatch has to have it because patches have

14:58.840 --> 14:59.840
those too.

14:59.840 --> 15:00.840
Yeah.

15:00.840 --> 15:03.000
Well, that's like what this, like this, what are those pinking shirts?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.600
What's the ones the zigzaggy ones, right?

15:04.600 --> 15:07.440
That's so that doesn't fray, you know, at the end.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.520
Maybe they don't want those to fray.

15:08.520 --> 15:09.520
I guess not.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.520
They probably don't.

15:10.520 --> 15:11.520
Please continue your story.

15:11.520 --> 15:16.120
Hey, hey, this story's full of all kinds of Easter eggs we can explore if you want.

15:16.120 --> 15:19.440
And by the way, if you're not enjoying the show, this is all bonus content.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.440
This is usually when we start.

15:21.440 --> 15:28.160
That was the cold open.

15:28.160 --> 15:36.200
So instantly, Like the alarm's going off.

15:36.200 --> 15:39.920
And you're sick and two.

15:39.920 --> 15:42.840
So it kind of goes red alert.

15:42.840 --> 15:46.360
These two guys, instantly, one guy looks over and goes,

15:46.360 --> 15:46.880
what's going on?

15:46.880 --> 15:48.160
The guy gets like, it's beeping.

15:48.160 --> 15:51.600
He's like, he's like, this doesn't happen.

15:51.600 --> 15:52.720
And I'm like, uh-oh.

15:52.720 --> 15:53.920
And the other guy comes over and he's like,

15:53.920 --> 15:54.880
what do you mean it's beeping?

15:54.880 --> 15:56.160
He's like, the thing is, it beeps.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.240
I put it on his hand and it beeps.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.640
And he's like, OK, sir, you have to come with us.

15:59.640 --> 16:03.200
And so they walked me all the way around the line,

16:03.200 --> 16:05.400
like to the front of the line, took all my shit through

16:05.400 --> 16:06.360
security, put it on a belt.

16:06.360 --> 16:11.800
So I go in front of the line, OK,

16:11.800 --> 16:13.800
they're going to find out a secondary thing

16:13.800 --> 16:15.800
that I didn't make a bomb today.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.440
And I'm going to have to get to go.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.280
Meanwhile, guess how many fucking bombs can get through?

16:20.280 --> 16:21.520
Well, that's happening.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.440
Anyways, quick note.

16:23.440 --> 16:27.200
So I guess we're going to go, they open up everything,

16:27.200 --> 16:28.800
all my stuff, and take everything out.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.800
And they wipe everything down with another little ravioli.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.760
I don't know how many raviolis they went through on this.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.920
But you could have had a lovely Italian meal then.

16:36.920 --> 16:41.880
Get a nice sauce.

16:41.880 --> 16:46.000
So then they take me into the sanctum sanctorum,

16:46.000 --> 16:47.320
this little private room.

16:47.320 --> 16:49.280
They go, we're going to take you in this room,

16:49.280 --> 16:51.720
and we're going to have to give you a full search,

16:51.720 --> 16:53.360
a full pat down.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.960
And I'm like, OK.

16:54.960 --> 16:57.680
And they go, but there's going to be two of us in the room.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.800
I'm like, OK, tell me why.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.760
Because it's so someone is watching to make sure

17:01.760 --> 17:03.360
that nothing he knows, whatever.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.120
But they both really got in there, man.

17:05.120 --> 17:07.640
They were like, I'm going to be touching you

17:07.640 --> 17:09.560
right on your situation.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.960
And it was fucking romantic.

17:14.960 --> 17:18.360
I'm like, you guys do work here, right?

17:18.360 --> 17:21.680
It was so hard not to crack a joke in there.

17:21.680 --> 17:22.720
I'm just like, wow.

17:22.720 --> 17:25.000
What you can't do, because that's how they get you.

17:25.000 --> 17:25.920
Yeah, exactly.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.320
That's how El Kano will slip up.

17:27.320 --> 17:28.880
They'll make a funny, funny joke.

17:28.880 --> 17:36.080
Like, don't be like, oh, knock, knock.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.560
Who's there?

17:38.560 --> 17:40.280
Kaboom, boom.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.520
It's like, OK, you're being awfully

17:42.520 --> 17:44.720
chipper about this whole thing.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.440
Step over there.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.960
We're not profiling, sir, except for just based

17:48.960 --> 17:49.840
on your wordplay.

17:53.240 --> 17:53.800
Yeah, so I mean.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.440
I don't want to say he lingered on my dick,

17:55.440 --> 17:58.400
but it certainly, it wasn't cursory.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.920
It was, it was, it was, it was thorough.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.480
So that's a third base, I think.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.320
And if you were, if you were, if you were told,

18:04.320 --> 18:06.120
and I don't think, I don't think the guy was like hover

18:06.120 --> 18:13.000
boarding through the X-ray machine toward the cockpit.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.680
I think, I think he was probably literally,

18:15.680 --> 18:17.880
I'm going to guess, if I know Wiz Khalifa.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.800
He was going to.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.720
I'm pretty sure he was probably in ticketing.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.560
You know, he was probably hovering at the kiosk where

18:24.560 --> 18:27.000
you get yourself checked in.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.360
And he was probably like, I love, I love the holla.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.560
I love the holla.

18:31.560 --> 18:33.720
Because he really, because these are the two things I really

18:33.720 --> 18:34.480
like about this guy.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.960
27 years old, covered in tattoos.

18:36.960 --> 18:41.280
Looking at him, he's the old white man's worst nightmare.

18:41.280 --> 18:44.920
You definitely want him off your lawn before anybody else.

18:44.920 --> 18:48.760
But very, very, very, very, very soft, turns out very,

18:48.760 --> 18:51.360
very soft-spoken and very, like, he's Henry David Thoreau.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.760
He's like, he acted in total civil disobedience.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.160
He's just like, no, I don't want to get off my hoverboard.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.920
I don't understand what's happening.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.280
Am I being arrested or detained?

19:00.280 --> 19:01.800
And then, you know, they slam him to the floor.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.760
And they're just like, stop resisting.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.560
That weird voice they use, they sound like lizards.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.440
Stop resisting.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.840
Stop resisting.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.720
And he just keeps going, I'm not resisting, sir.

19:12.720 --> 19:13.840
I'm not resisting, sir.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.960
I mean, he's probably done it a thousand times.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.080
And he was tweeting about the whole thing.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.400
I'm going to guess with that, I've

19:19.400 --> 19:21.760
pet peeved of mine that police insist on calling

19:21.760 --> 19:23.360
everything a vehicle.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.840
Just say car.

19:24.840 --> 19:25.520
Yeah.

19:25.520 --> 19:26.760
Get out of the vehicle, sir.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.800
Well, Jeff, what you have to understand

19:28.800 --> 19:30.760
is that at this point in time that they have to speak longer

19:30.760 --> 19:32.200
so that they can take longer to figure out

19:32.200 --> 19:33.400
what it is that they're trying to say

19:33.400 --> 19:34.600
at this particular juncture.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.080
Yeah.

19:36.080 --> 19:39.760
So they figured out, there's like, what's Styrofoam words?

19:39.760 --> 19:47.800
Because they can't go, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, bad driving?

19:47.800 --> 19:49.000
Ticket here.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.800
I was like, they probably, they pound that into their heads

19:53.800 --> 19:57.920
for the entire six weeks you are trained to, uh,

19:57.920 --> 20:01.160
to then walk into the public with a gun.

20:01.160 --> 20:04.320
They, during that six weeks, they tell you, uh,

20:04.320 --> 20:08.160
these people are animals, and you have to, uh,

20:08.160 --> 20:10.000
you have to hold a chair in front of you,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.240
but you're not allowed to hold a chair because of these fucking

20:12.240 --> 20:13.640
lawyers.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.960
So your chair has to be your attitude.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.400
You know, you have to, because if you turn your fucking

20:18.400 --> 20:21.000
fucking people will just rip your skin off and wear it

20:21.000 --> 20:25.440
like a fucking hat, you know, they're just waiting.

20:25.440 --> 20:26.240
They're just waiting.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.200
Oh, they'd love it if you didn't show up for work tomorrow.

20:28.200 --> 20:32.000
They would just, oh, they'd eat all the ice cream.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.240
They'd be hoverboarding everywhere.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.440
They'd never stop hovering.

20:35.440 --> 20:38.800
And among the many hilarious things

20:38.800 --> 20:42.840
that Mr. Khalifa pointed out, or I call them whiz,

20:42.840 --> 20:45.200
because I feel like we're friends,

20:45.200 --> 20:47.520
is that in two years, the cops are

20:47.520 --> 20:49.160
going to be riding these things all over.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.880
That's what, this is going to be their new thing.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.880
There's going to be hover cops fucking like whizzing around.

20:53.880 --> 20:57.680
And he said, it'll probably be one that I designed,

20:57.680 --> 20:59.120
which I thought was weird.

20:59.120 --> 21:00.400
But then I thought, you know what?

21:00.400 --> 21:02.120
He's probably a stockholder of the fucking hoverboards.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.440
Now he's even more my hero.

21:03.440 --> 21:04.880
He's a fucking marketing genius.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.120
Yeah.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.440
He probably paid the cops.

21:07.440 --> 21:10.320
See now, was it just a big, was it just a big commercial stunt?

21:10.320 --> 21:12.280
If it was, it's the kind of commercial I approve of.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.360
But anyways, I like them.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.640
Let's invite them on the show.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.960
Well, I tweeted at them, so usually that

21:19.960 --> 21:23.160
ends with people coming on the show, right?

21:23.160 --> 21:24.640
I tweeted at them.

21:24.640 --> 21:30.080
I saw your face in the news, and your hoverboard problems.

21:32.840 --> 21:36.160
I didn't say blues, because I didn't want to do it

21:36.160 --> 21:37.960
on the nose rhyme.

21:37.960 --> 21:41.480
And I know this isn't you singing in that song

21:41.480 --> 21:43.320
from Fast and Furious.

21:43.320 --> 21:48.120
But the next part is probably you.

21:48.120 --> 21:51.040
Yo, yo, it seems like back in the day,

21:51.040 --> 21:53.480
you were at LAX in the usual passenger way.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.960
You tried to hoverboard your way through the usual way.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.920
But the cops and the cops and the hoppers and the hoppers

21:57.920 --> 21:58.760
and the lop-a-dops.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.600
And when you come on our show.

22:03.600 --> 22:04.960
You know what's amazing?

22:04.960 --> 22:09.320
Those lyrics are as true today as the day they're in.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.960
People be talking about, so talk about how about going out.

22:11.960 --> 22:12.680
I can't do it.

22:12.680 --> 22:15.400
Lots of things are happening in various ways.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.160
All right, so they're panicking about, well,

22:18.160 --> 22:22.000
this is from our international correspondent, Irish Aaron

22:22.000 --> 22:23.640
McGathey.

22:23.640 --> 22:26.280
She's a show's texting with her today.

22:26.280 --> 22:30.600
We only have a little window, because of the time difference.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.200
So we try to pack a lot of communication in.

22:32.200 --> 22:36.560
But the Irish are actually a little bit concerned

22:36.560 --> 22:37.280
about Donald Trump.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.640
They think he's going to win.

22:38.640 --> 22:41.600
And they're like asking her, because she's

22:41.600 --> 22:42.760
the American ambassador.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.880
They're like, he's not going to win, is he?

22:44.880 --> 22:46.600
So it's going to make people with red hair

22:46.600 --> 22:47.760
look bad all around the world.

22:47.760 --> 22:50.360
That's what they're scared about.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.680
And I told her, as I said, tell them

22:52.680 --> 22:54.520
that the media has been more globalized

22:54.520 --> 22:55.640
over the last couple of years.

22:55.640 --> 22:58.400
So everything seems to be happening sooner and more

22:58.400 --> 22:59.080
sincerely.

22:59.080 --> 23:03.760
But this is usual year from the election pre-circus.

23:03.760 --> 23:06.320
I mean, we lucked out with this guy.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.600
He's fucking amazing.

23:08.600 --> 23:12.920
But if you step back and look at it

23:12.920 --> 23:14.840
as the Republicans and Democrats functioning

23:14.840 --> 23:16.760
as one organization, which they literally do,

23:16.760 --> 23:19.200
and that does not mean that health care and all the issues

23:19.200 --> 23:20.600
that they break down microcosmically

23:20.600 --> 23:23.120
are not important to human beings,

23:23.120 --> 23:24.960
I'm just saying these guys literally

23:24.960 --> 23:28.920
are a single, quality corporation.

23:28.920 --> 23:29.800
They run the debates.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.040
They run the election.

23:31.040 --> 23:34.920
An argument could be made that they completely marginalize

23:34.920 --> 23:37.800
the entire spectrum of political thought around the planet.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.240
Because everybody has followed suit

23:39.240 --> 23:43.400
with this weird duopoly dichotomy of elephants and donkeys.

23:43.400 --> 23:47.960
I just call them bananas and cantaloupes in Bavaria.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.360
I don't know what that.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.600
Oh, they's all the pudding party.

23:51.600 --> 23:52.320
There they go again.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.360
And it's like, I think you learn this from us.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.640
There's this Coke Pepsi thing that

23:56.640 --> 23:59.280
evolves if your empire is perfectly comfortable.

23:59.280 --> 24:03.720
And it just turns into this kind of just standard kind

24:03.720 --> 24:07.600
of like, well, we don't really want to change anything.

24:07.600 --> 24:11.040
But here's our two moods.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.800
We want everybody to be happy.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.400
I'm not going to do anything about it.

24:15.400 --> 24:18.680
So let's run those two thoughts against each other.

24:18.680 --> 24:22.200
And the good news about that is it's Trump-proof.

24:22.200 --> 24:23.640
He's not going to get elected.

24:23.640 --> 24:27.840
These people, they wouldn't let a third party

24:27.840 --> 24:29.920
come near the possibility.

24:29.920 --> 24:35.080
Before that happens, Seattle will explode when Trump's in it.

24:35.080 --> 24:38.480
And then people will be like, I don't know, it's a weird coffee

24:38.480 --> 24:40.480
explosion.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.480
It's part of global warming.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.960
And the city blew up.

24:42.960 --> 24:46.040
And so Trump's dead.

24:46.040 --> 24:47.960
I mean, they don't have to do that though.

24:47.960 --> 24:50.400
I think it's going to have to get pretty sloppy

24:50.400 --> 24:51.880
before this is all done.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.840
But that's why they're giving him a year.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.040
Like, that's what it's all about.

24:55.040 --> 24:58.120
This is a ritualistic murder of a guy who's unauthorized.

24:58.120 --> 25:00.600
I think it's sad that he functions,

25:00.600 --> 25:01.880
that he registers as anything.

25:01.880 --> 25:03.400
All this guy is as a friend of your dad's.

25:03.400 --> 25:07.320
Like, he's not even, like, Bernie Sanders

25:07.320 --> 25:09.960
should be the one that's raising a stink, and he is.

25:09.960 --> 25:12.920
But he's raising it in a boring way.

25:12.920 --> 25:15.680
But people are so into, and yeah,

25:15.680 --> 25:18.320
his hair is very interesting.

25:18.320 --> 25:22.440
And he does say things like, on the view when he was taught,

25:22.440 --> 25:23.640
this is an old quote.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.640
But now people are like, people are so concerned

25:25.640 --> 25:27.640
that Donald Trump is going to win,

25:27.640 --> 25:31.200
that they're really coming at him in a kind of like,

25:31.200 --> 25:34.960
he's the anti-Christ, like, as if he hasn't been,

25:34.960 --> 25:36.800
as Spencer said today at dinner,

25:38.320 --> 25:40.040
I feel like Donald Trump's been running for president

25:40.040 --> 25:42.040
for 30 years.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.560
And it's just now getting traction.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.000
He has, though, right?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.560
That's all he's ever been doing is going like,

25:46.560 --> 25:47.720
I'll tell you what I would do to it.

25:47.720 --> 25:48.800
I'll tell you why I'll do it.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.440
I would put me in charge, and here's why.

25:50.440 --> 25:51.360
My air conditioning works.

25:51.360 --> 25:54.800
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

25:54.800 --> 25:59.040
And now, all of a sudden, it's just this particularly

25:59.040 --> 26:02.000
boring election, and who cares?

26:02.000 --> 26:05.240
But anyways, I forgot what I was going to say.

26:05.240 --> 26:06.240
The view.

26:06.240 --> 26:07.880
Oh, he said on the view like a couple of years ago,

26:07.880 --> 26:08.840
Aaron sent me this quote.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.120
He said, because he was taught,

26:10.120 --> 26:12.760
they were asking him about his daughter, Ivanka,

26:12.760 --> 26:15.200
being in Playboy, or whether she would be in Playboy.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.000
And he said, I don't think.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.960
Now, quotes suck, like he quoted,

26:18.960 --> 26:19.920
you're quoted on a context.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.360
I'm sure he was very charming and self-effacing about this.

26:22.360 --> 26:25.840
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.960
But the fact of the matter is,

26:27.960 --> 26:32.120
what he said was, and I don't think my daughter, Ivanka,

26:32.120 --> 26:34.000
I don't think she would do that,

26:34.000 --> 26:35.720
in reference to her posing for Playboy.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.880
Although she does have a very nice figure,

26:37.880 --> 26:39.800
I've said, if Ivanka weren't my daughter,

26:39.800 --> 26:40.960
perhaps I'd be dating her.

26:40.960 --> 26:41.800
Whoa!

26:41.800 --> 26:42.640
Oh!

26:44.360 --> 26:46.040
Just to, just to split this hair.

26:46.040 --> 26:49.240
Now, I know you, the weird thing about this is, like,

26:50.240 --> 26:51.080
what is it?

26:51.080 --> 26:54.320
What is that reaction, like, in a cartoon,

26:54.320 --> 26:55.440
we would look out and the whole audience

26:55.440 --> 26:56.680
would have Trump hair all of a sudden.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.520
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.080
I'll tell you the two parts of that joke

27:00.080 --> 27:02.200
that are fun to analyze.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.440
It's the, because, because I can picture myself.

27:04.440 --> 27:06.800
I like the gross incest and pedophile part.

27:06.800 --> 27:07.800
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.320
I can picture myself putting my foot in that same mouth,

27:10.320 --> 27:12.560
like if I had a daughter and someone brought that up

27:12.560 --> 27:15.760
to me, like, in Trapp, but, but, but, but the things are,

27:15.760 --> 27:19.040
the word figure is weird

27:19.040 --> 27:22.760
because it evokes actual, her actual physical tissue.

27:22.760 --> 27:25.760
Like, like it's not saying, she's pretty, or she, you know,

27:25.760 --> 27:27.160
Yeah, he's talking about tips and ask at that point.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.760
Yeah, she has a nice figure.

27:28.760 --> 27:33.640
Like her boobs look good, like her ass looks like something

27:33.640 --> 27:37.240
you would want to touch, is in that word figure.

27:37.240 --> 27:41.240
And then the real murderer is, I've said,

27:41.240 --> 27:42.520
like he's quoting himself.

27:42.520 --> 27:45.240
He's not putting his foot in his mouth.

27:45.240 --> 27:47.160
He's taking his foot out of his mouth and going,

27:47.160 --> 27:49.520
you know what I always say?

27:49.520 --> 27:53.360
A daughter fuck a day keeps a doctor alive.

27:53.360 --> 27:54.200
And you know what?

27:54.200 --> 27:55.720
You're going to read me misquoted on that

27:55.720 --> 27:57.800
in previous things, and I'm setting the record straight.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.560
I got a hot daughter, and she's good to go.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.000
I got bumper stickers.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.680
I've got posters, bumpers.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.680
I've been very, very candid about this.

28:05.680 --> 28:07.560
I said, I want to be, does the people

28:07.560 --> 28:10.440
think I didn't say this?

28:10.440 --> 28:12.640
Because it's not newsworthy.

28:12.640 --> 28:15.360
Well, I'm telling you, my daughter's hot.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.520
I've said it.

28:16.520 --> 28:21.480
Also, the extra little cherry and peanut sprinkle

28:21.480 --> 28:25.680
on top of that gross Sunday is the idea that, OK,

28:25.680 --> 28:28.440
let's say you weren't your daughter,

28:28.440 --> 28:31.280
but the presumption being that this hot woman would date you.

28:31.280 --> 28:32.480
Like, well, we'd be dating.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.240
I should actually be in the bag.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.600
Well, this is where I'll split the semantic here.

28:36.600 --> 28:40.400
If Donald Trump were a guest on the show, hope, hope, hope.

28:40.400 --> 28:42.880
Fuck.

28:42.880 --> 28:47.760
Or if anybody that chose to take that side for whatever reason,

28:47.760 --> 28:50.480
in other words, to be the devil's advocate.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.880
But there's not another side to the issue,

28:52.880 --> 28:54.680
but there is just the mitigating factor

28:54.680 --> 28:57.360
that I realized when I was reading more about that quote.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.440
Because I thought it might just be a fabricated quote

28:59.440 --> 29:00.200
that somebody just made up.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.280
Because it's kind of believable that he would say that,

29:02.280 --> 29:04.520
but also unbelievable to say.

29:04.520 --> 29:08.000
Anyways, he said it on the view, and you read the larger

29:08.000 --> 29:12.760
context, and you're kind of like, all right, in his mind,

29:12.760 --> 29:19.520
his bit is that he's often lampooned for dating young women.

29:19.520 --> 29:23.640
It's like, you know me, old young fucker.

29:23.640 --> 29:27.000
It's funny, because all the fucking I do with young women,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.760
it's to the point where the young women I make by fucking,

29:29.760 --> 29:30.520
I'd fuck them.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.160
I know, I know.

29:36.160 --> 29:38.360
Dean Martin drinks, and I do that.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.680
Like, in his mind, he's like, that's my gimmick,

29:44.680 --> 29:46.520
and I'm giving myself the raz.

29:46.520 --> 29:51.680
Like, because he's talking to the view women,

29:51.680 --> 29:53.920
he's like, I know, ladies, before you even talk,

29:53.920 --> 29:57.360
before you even start lampooning me for my weaknesses,

29:57.360 --> 30:00.040
allow me to pierce myself to my own Achilles heel.

30:00.040 --> 30:02.040
I do fuck a lot of young women.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.040
My daughter is very beautiful, so the dot

30:04.040 --> 30:06.520
is easy to connect there, that if she weren't my daughter,

30:06.520 --> 30:08.720
she'd probably be one of the women I fucked,

30:08.720 --> 30:10.040
because of my flaws.

30:13.960 --> 30:16.120
All right, well, it's good to give equal time to Donald Trump.

30:16.120 --> 30:17.720
He hasn't been in the media a lot,

30:17.720 --> 30:20.720
so that's the beauty about podcasting,

30:20.720 --> 30:23.920
is you get to hear things that you wouldn't hear

30:23.920 --> 30:24.640
at other places.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.480
All right, the raccoon is back eating my dog food,

30:29.480 --> 30:32.400
but I think I've dealt with that by closing the app.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.960
Same raccoon, you think?

30:33.960 --> 30:35.560
Oh, I don't know about that.

30:35.560 --> 30:37.200
I think they multiple.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.040
I mean, you just know recognizable features

30:39.040 --> 30:39.800
on this raccoon?

30:39.800 --> 30:42.600
No, oh yeah, like a bandit mask and opposable thumbs.

30:42.600 --> 30:45.200
No, no, no, no, I literally haven't seen it,

30:45.200 --> 30:46.960
but I've seen its paw prints in the water

30:46.960 --> 30:48.480
around the spilled water discharge.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.400
Like Harvey has to hold vigil, and he goes and barks at it,

30:51.400 --> 30:52.600
and then I see the paw prints.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.320
So then I started closing the doggie door after a certain time.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.200
If I close it too early, Nigel will piss on the floor.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.040
I found out.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.720
Harvey just got me right on the shoe the other day.

31:01.720 --> 31:03.920
I came in the door, he rolled over on his back,

31:03.920 --> 31:06.280
and I sort of pet in his belly, and just a little rainbow

31:06.280 --> 31:08.520
of pee right on my shoe.

31:08.520 --> 31:11.080
That, I'm hoping, is his steroid medication

31:11.080 --> 31:13.200
for his ear infection, which maybe was still

31:13.200 --> 31:15.760
weakening his bladder or something, I hope.

31:15.760 --> 31:16.760
I hope he's not.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.640
I hope it's not.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.560
And I don't even want to say what I hope it's not,

31:20.560 --> 31:23.280
because then if Erin's listening to that,

31:23.280 --> 31:29.840
because I hope it's not like anxiety from Erin being gone.

31:29.840 --> 31:30.840
That could be.

31:30.840 --> 31:33.000
No.

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
I mean, it's Occam's razor because that's

31:37.000 --> 31:40.560
how I react to her being gone.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.920
Yeah, I was pissed on my shoe so many times.

31:42.920 --> 31:47.240
I may as well just lay in my bed and I piss on my own stomach,

31:47.240 --> 31:50.800
because I'm like, well, who was I not doing this for?

31:50.800 --> 31:53.960
She's in a different time zone.

31:53.960 --> 31:55.720
Like, not only is she a different country,

31:55.720 --> 31:56.840
but her time is different.

31:56.840 --> 31:59.040
She's looking at a sun when I'm looking at a moon.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.080
I can pee on myself.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.560
Finally.

32:03.560 --> 32:07.240
Are you getting a lot of video game play in while she's away?

32:07.240 --> 32:10.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:10.440 --> 32:11.040
Is that fine?

32:11.040 --> 32:11.680
You enjoying it?

32:11.680 --> 32:12.560
Yeah, very much.

32:12.560 --> 32:15.240
Far Cry 4 much?

32:15.240 --> 32:18.280
Sure, sure.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.880
But I actually like Far Cry 4 is so potentially

32:20.880 --> 32:23.160
addictive that I've actually been playing Grand Theft Auto 5

32:23.160 --> 32:23.920
for some reason.

32:23.920 --> 32:26.920
Like, I don't know what it is.

32:26.920 --> 32:28.040
I just follow my cravings.

32:28.040 --> 32:32.520
But I've been playing Grand Theft Auto 5 lately.

32:32.520 --> 32:34.120
I kept that sweatshirt on for too long

32:34.120 --> 32:36.760
and I told you guys last week, I'm hotter up here.

32:36.760 --> 32:37.560
I'm not fatter.

32:37.560 --> 32:42.800
Or if I am fatter, it's not.

32:42.800 --> 32:43.720
It's healthy fat.

32:43.720 --> 32:46.960
It's not coming out of me in the form of liquid.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.520
If I was sitting where you were sitting,

32:48.520 --> 32:49.600
I would look like James Bond.

32:54.320 --> 32:58.440
Yvonne Craig, we lost Yvonne Craig, TV's Batgirl

32:58.440 --> 33:00.640
from the Adam West series.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.080
Wow.

33:02.080 --> 33:05.560
What do you say about that?

33:05.560 --> 33:06.400
Nothing funny.

33:06.400 --> 33:07.640
No.

33:07.640 --> 33:09.720
And also, nothing particularly sincere,

33:09.720 --> 33:12.320
because the true, sincere way in which she's a part of my life

33:12.320 --> 33:14.160
is the awakening of my sexuality.

33:14.160 --> 33:18.560
And it seems offensive to do that over someone's grave.

33:18.560 --> 33:22.720
I was like, whoa, thanks for giving me my first boner.

33:22.720 --> 33:24.000
Just throw a little dirt.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.920
Feels wrong to do that.

33:29.920 --> 33:33.040
Yeah, but you can be honest with yourself about that, you know?

33:33.040 --> 33:34.680
I mean, you know what it is?

33:34.680 --> 33:40.440
Don't address her as if you're, like, just say,

33:40.440 --> 33:41.640
it's sad when people die.

33:41.640 --> 33:45.960
We miss you, stranger, who we never knew, personally,

33:45.960 --> 33:52.000
speaking of which, her image on the TV screen when I was,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.640
you know, six or whatever.

33:54.640 --> 33:59.160
It's like, it was the first dopamine spike in my head.

33:59.160 --> 34:02.240
You saved us for the view, man.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.720
I've often said.

34:03.720 --> 34:09.000
I hope that Aaron and I have a beautiful redhead daughter

34:09.000 --> 34:13.200
that'll dress like Batgirl, because knowing me,

34:13.200 --> 34:17.840
no, I'm making fun of myself, I'll fuck her.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.200
No, I'm making fun of myself.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.880
I'm always fucking redheads.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.320
My daughter was a redhead.

34:27.320 --> 34:35.120
It's called self-deprecation, guys.

34:40.480 --> 34:43.280
That's his idea of a joke making fun of himself.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.800
He's not too smart.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.760
When he says he's often said it, does that

34:47.760 --> 34:49.680
include to her over breakfast?

34:52.240 --> 34:55.280
And is it there for any wonder that she's not a violinist,

34:55.280 --> 34:57.400
you know, that she's just?

35:04.040 --> 35:06.520
Everybody be perfectly still.

35:06.520 --> 35:10.560
We have a mythical creature in the room.

35:10.560 --> 35:13.720
It's the ghost of LA Philharmonic stereotypes.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.320
That was so cute.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.720
I feel like that person.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.880
Was that a man or a woman that made that laugh?

35:24.880 --> 35:26.440
It was you.

35:26.440 --> 35:29.880
Are you a violinist, or are you just confused by my logic?

35:29.880 --> 35:31.120
Oh, OK.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.560
Interesting.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.200
Is it your favorite, I mean, to his credit,

35:35.200 --> 35:37.680
his face is kind of bright red right now.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.400
It's very charming.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.440
That was a sincere sound.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.840
He didn't mean to take the spotlight.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.480
I was saying, well, I'll tell you now,

35:44.480 --> 35:46.440
since you put yourself out there,

35:46.440 --> 35:48.320
I will put myself out there.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.680
I guess in the moment when I was riffing was,

35:50.680 --> 35:52.520
and maybe if we picked this apart,

35:52.520 --> 35:55.440
we'll probably find out that I'm sexist somehow.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.840
But I was saying, like, if you're

35:57.840 --> 36:00.720
eating breakfast with a guy that talks like that to you,

36:00.720 --> 36:02.600
because isn't she like a model?

36:02.600 --> 36:03.760
I don't know the first thing about her.

36:03.760 --> 36:06.160
I thought she was also like a business person.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.280
All right, fine.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.840
Fine.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.880
See, I'm sexist.

36:11.880 --> 36:12.840
I thought she was a model.

36:12.840 --> 36:13.960
That's the end of that story.

36:13.960 --> 36:16.240
I thought she was a model.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.640
I didn't think, as me, I didn't think

36:17.640 --> 36:19.360
it was possible for her to be anything else.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.640
I don't get the Philharmonic stereotype joke.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.400
What does that mean?

36:23.400 --> 36:28.000
Well, that's not going to pull up if you pick it apart.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.640
OK, I just thought you were connecting something.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.680
My joke was, but it wouldn't make sense

36:35.680 --> 36:37.920
that it was the ghost of LA Philharmonic Stereotypes.

36:37.920 --> 36:41.880
My joke was that that was an entity in the crowd

36:41.880 --> 36:44.480
that was tired of violinists being stereotypes.

36:44.480 --> 36:45.480
You understand what I'm saying?

36:45.480 --> 36:46.360
Oh, yeah.

36:46.360 --> 36:48.760
But the ghost of stereotype doesn't make any sense.

36:48.760 --> 36:49.840
So you caught me again.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.480
No, no, I just thought I was missing something out.

36:52.480 --> 36:55.640
Maybe it shouldn't be a free podcast.

36:59.880 --> 37:02.360
What if we made it free, but if you

37:02.360 --> 37:05.800
wanted to listen to episodes older than a year,

37:05.800 --> 37:08.720
you had to pay $5 a month?

37:08.720 --> 37:11.040
Yeah, Dustin, high five.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.080
Yeah.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.520
No, we're not going to have any cross-label shit talk tonight

37:14.520 --> 37:17.200
because if our special guest is here, is he here?

37:17.200 --> 37:18.120
Oh, cool.

37:18.120 --> 37:19.920
Great.

37:19.920 --> 37:21.920
Our special guest has an ear-wolf podcast,

37:21.920 --> 37:24.240
so now you've done it.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.800
It's not anymore?

37:26.800 --> 37:27.640
Wait, what?

37:27.640 --> 37:28.960
It's not an ear-wolf anymore.

37:28.960 --> 37:29.600
Oh.

37:29.600 --> 37:33.680
Now who's being the brash?

37:33.680 --> 37:36.240
That's not the word.

37:36.240 --> 37:37.080
Kazing!

37:37.080 --> 37:37.580
Yeah.

37:40.320 --> 37:41.520
Ham-fisted.

37:41.520 --> 37:42.840
That's the word I was looking for.

37:42.840 --> 37:43.840
Is he just wandering now?

37:43.840 --> 37:44.600
Is he a free agent?

37:44.600 --> 37:47.000
Well, yeah, ask me.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.560
OK, because we'll poach his ass.

37:49.560 --> 37:52.000
We'll scoop him up.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.160
That's easy for us to do.

37:53.160 --> 37:55.320
Now, pianist guy, what's your name?

37:55.320 --> 37:56.240
Barton Lewis.

37:56.240 --> 38:00.720
Barton Lewis and Barton Lewis.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.440
And the guy next to you, what's your name?

38:02.440 --> 38:03.040
Julia.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.520
You seem to know a lot about this.

38:04.520 --> 38:07.440
Do you work with Horatio?

38:07.440 --> 38:08.720
I'm one of his best.

38:08.720 --> 38:09.720
I think they're part of his team.

38:09.720 --> 38:10.760
They're how we were able to connect them.

38:10.760 --> 38:11.320
Oh, great.

38:11.320 --> 38:12.000
Welcome to the show.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.480
Thanks for getting them for us.

38:13.480 --> 38:15.560
Well, let's bring them up.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.680
I totally blew the reveal on that.

38:18.680 --> 38:19.200
Yeah, yeah.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.200
There could be any Horatio.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.560
We don't know what Horatio I'm talking about.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.680
Right, so I didn't hear you say Horatio,

38:24.680 --> 38:26.400
but now fuck Jesus.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.800
Horatio Cummings, everybody.

38:32.800 --> 38:35.600
Maybe it's a hornblower?

38:35.600 --> 38:37.080
Horatio Hornblower.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.080
Oh.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.080
Oh.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.080
Oh.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.080
I forgot your mic.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.080
Maybe it's a fifth Ninja Turtle?

38:47.080 --> 38:50.080
It's more important to introduce the kind of like,

38:50.080 --> 38:52.080
I think one of the things that we're going to be talking to them

38:52.080 --> 38:57.800
about, I hope, I hope to, is at least once on this show,

38:57.800 --> 39:00.880
and then I know on Doug Love's movies,

39:00.880 --> 39:03.960
we've talked about our fascination with this movie,

39:03.960 --> 39:06.960
Boat Trip.

39:06.960 --> 39:12.480
And it was, you know, I was looking at the Wikipedia entry

39:12.480 --> 39:14.800
and looking at the, you know, you click that reception header

39:14.800 --> 39:18.840
and it comes down and it's like, it is a kind of historically

39:18.840 --> 39:20.040
critically panned movie.

39:20.040 --> 39:28.040
It takes its place up there, but it's one of those movies that's

39:28.040 --> 39:33.520
so, it's fascinating and confusing in a lot of parts.

39:33.520 --> 39:36.440
And so we have talked about it.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.800
And I say that without fear of being petty because he didn't

39:38.800 --> 39:40.400
write it or direct it or anything.

39:40.400 --> 39:42.240
Now I feel like the writer or director is going to kill

39:42.240 --> 39:46.280
himself, but they probably, the bottom line is movies are

39:46.280 --> 39:47.960
flukes and God only knows what happens.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.960
But he'd heard me talking about it or someone heard me talking

39:50.960 --> 39:52.000
about it on Doug Love's movies.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.320
Somebody got in touch with somebody.

39:53.320 --> 39:54.960
DeMorge Brown was involved somehow.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.720
Something happened and they were like, he should come on the

39:56.720 --> 39:59.400
show and I think he was game, either that or he's just the

39:59.400 --> 40:01.120
nicest guy in the world and was just like, why is everyone

40:01.120 --> 40:04.120
telling me to come here and now it's mean?

40:04.120 --> 40:06.640
But I think he was involved too and was like, yeah, I want to

40:06.640 --> 40:07.400
come and talk about it.

40:07.400 --> 40:10.720
Anyways, at any rate, it'll be interesting to talk to him

40:10.720 --> 40:12.920
about anything because he's been a part of the comedic

40:12.920 --> 40:15.880
wallpaper for over a decade.

40:15.880 --> 40:21.400
He's a founding member of, the right word, like he was down

40:21.400 --> 40:23.840
there in the trenches when Upright Citizens Brigade was

40:23.840 --> 40:29.880
just an actual downright non-citizen brigade.

40:29.880 --> 40:32.920
And he was on SNL for years and years and years and years.

40:32.920 --> 40:41.360
And then he was in Bo Tripp and all kinds of other stuff.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.760
But let's bring him out and get to know him.

40:42.760 --> 40:43.840
Horatio Sanz is here.

40:43.840 --> 41:05.040
Sorry about my horrible introduction and sorry in advance

41:05.040 --> 41:06.040
for my bad interviewing.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.280
Well, no, I'm glad you explained everybody what was

41:08.280 --> 41:09.280
happening.

41:09.280 --> 41:15.600
Are you being sarcastic because I did want them to know.

41:15.600 --> 41:16.600
No, no, I'm not.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.280
I'm glad that you did, actually.

41:18.280 --> 41:19.280
Yeah.

41:19.280 --> 41:23.360
But I'm not even sure, can you catch us up on your part?

41:23.360 --> 41:29.000
Because I haven't talked to you about this until now.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.160
I didn't see you in the green room, for instance.

41:31.160 --> 41:34.320
So I don't know, were you ambushed or did somebody urge you

41:34.320 --> 41:35.320
to do this?

41:35.320 --> 41:37.040
Or were you listening to Doug Love's movies?

41:37.040 --> 41:38.040
What was this?

41:38.040 --> 41:41.200
No one heard it and then he's actually working on the podcast

41:41.200 --> 41:42.200
I'm working on.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.880
So he's like, you should listen to it and then you should go on

41:43.880 --> 41:45.640
it.

41:45.640 --> 41:48.880
And then I listen to it and now I'm here.

41:48.880 --> 41:51.120
All right.

41:51.120 --> 41:52.120
Forgive me, Horatio.

41:52.120 --> 41:53.920
What is the name of your podcast?

41:53.920 --> 41:54.920
The Horatio.

41:54.920 --> 41:55.920
Ah.

41:55.920 --> 41:59.600
Oh, I just got that.

41:59.600 --> 42:00.600
Real nice.

42:00.600 --> 42:01.600
Yeah.

42:01.600 --> 42:02.600
I really did.

42:02.600 --> 42:03.600
A lot of people just get it.

42:03.600 --> 42:04.600
That's why it's hard to find.

42:04.600 --> 42:08.760
But it is the word hooray and then show and then at the end,

42:08.760 --> 42:10.360
you know, you go, oh, I get it.

42:10.360 --> 42:11.360
Horatio.

42:11.360 --> 42:12.360
Wait.

42:12.360 --> 42:13.360
Now I just got the show part.

42:13.360 --> 42:14.360
No.

42:14.360 --> 42:15.360
A lot of levels.

42:15.360 --> 42:16.360
I'm working on a lot of levels.

42:16.360 --> 42:18.440
I thought the hooray was enough.

42:18.440 --> 42:19.960
Oh, yeah?

42:19.960 --> 42:21.760
And then the last part is show.

42:21.760 --> 42:23.720
No, it's like making your whole name.

42:23.720 --> 42:24.720
Yeah.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.720
You should do a podcast.

42:26.720 --> 42:27.720
I do.

42:27.720 --> 42:28.720
I do.

42:28.720 --> 42:33.720
And it's not on Ear Wolf as we were reminded by another associate

42:33.720 --> 42:35.920
of mine, Julia.

42:35.920 --> 42:39.600
But you know, you can, I don't know if I'll get yelled at this,

42:39.600 --> 42:41.360
but make them a Feral Audio podcast.

42:41.360 --> 42:42.360
Okay.

42:42.360 --> 42:43.360
Good.

42:43.360 --> 42:44.360
There we go.

42:44.360 --> 42:45.360
Thank you.

42:45.360 --> 42:46.360
Welcome to the Feral Audio Network.

42:46.360 --> 42:47.360
It's, we have, we have.

42:47.360 --> 42:49.400
Are we just absorbing him right now?

42:49.400 --> 42:51.240
We have a potluck every Thursday.

42:51.240 --> 42:56.240
That's a little high maintenance, but like only, only if your, only if your downloads

42:56.240 --> 43:00.360
are below a certain number, are you actually expected to bring like potluck stuff?

43:00.360 --> 43:03.440
Like I, I just show up and fucking shit.

43:03.440 --> 43:04.440
Like Duncan Trussell makes.

43:04.440 --> 43:11.040
I'm like, what's this?

43:11.040 --> 43:12.040
So, okay.

43:12.040 --> 43:15.640
So I don't, I mean, there's a million things we can talk about.

43:15.640 --> 43:18.840
Well, we, we should really talk about the boat trip.

43:18.840 --> 43:19.840
The boat trip.

43:19.840 --> 43:20.840
Yeah.

43:20.840 --> 43:23.320
I mean, but I feel like, I feel like once we get there, it's going to be weird to segue

43:23.320 --> 43:24.320
out of it.

43:24.320 --> 43:25.320
So I just.

43:25.320 --> 43:26.320
No, no, it'll be fascinating.

43:26.320 --> 43:27.320
You'll love it.

43:27.320 --> 43:29.400
I just do want to say one thing.

43:29.400 --> 43:37.520
I am here because they're releasing it on a criterion collection, a lot of cool audio

43:37.520 --> 43:41.320
commentary with me and Cuba.

43:41.320 --> 43:44.800
We have the ex-wife of Roger Moore, who's going to provide some commentary.

43:44.800 --> 43:47.560
So it's all good.

43:47.560 --> 43:49.600
The one other thing because I'm going to forget it.

43:49.600 --> 43:50.600
If we start talking about boat trips.

43:50.600 --> 43:56.280
So I just want to say the other piece of trivia is that you literally stole took.

43:56.280 --> 43:59.160
You didn't steal because it didn't belong to me.

43:59.160 --> 44:04.880
You were, you, it was down to me and you for the role of the Manny on, in the motherhood.

44:04.880 --> 44:05.880
You won.

44:05.880 --> 44:09.760
I won the, I won the larger war.

44:09.760 --> 44:10.760
Yeah.

44:10.760 --> 44:11.760
Yeah.

44:11.760 --> 44:16.200
How many, how many episodes did it run, but it was, it ran seven.

44:16.200 --> 44:20.680
It was like, I somehow made it through this weird gauntlet of people that, that, that

44:20.680 --> 44:25.560
must have been actually, I remember Besser was, was in some of the early auditions and

44:25.560 --> 44:27.680
callbacks and stuff.

44:27.680 --> 44:31.560
And then I, and then I, I was like, wait, what, they're, I think I, I think I might

44:31.560 --> 44:34.200
be like in the running and they just brought you in at the last minute.

44:34.200 --> 44:35.560
And then I was like, Oh God, they hate me.

44:35.560 --> 44:36.560
I'm fucked.

44:36.560 --> 44:40.200
Cause, cause they were like, Oh, just, they, they, they, they thought of you and found you

44:40.200 --> 44:41.200
and brought you in.

44:41.200 --> 44:44.680
And it was obviously like, you had gotten the part because before that I was slipping

44:44.680 --> 44:46.720
through the cracks undetected.

44:46.720 --> 44:52.960
And then I saw you and I was like, Oh boy, they found a professional actor.

44:52.960 --> 45:01.200
No, I remember, I remember that, that time I heard you were a great guy and, and, but

45:01.200 --> 45:06.480
I do remember that I felt that you were a little nervous.

45:06.480 --> 45:07.480
Oh yeah.

45:07.480 --> 45:12.920
So I kind of was like, okay, cause I didn't know who you were, but when you ever, whenever

45:12.920 --> 45:17.680
you're getting into those situations, you're either the type of guy who thinks you can

45:17.680 --> 45:20.000
twist the other guy around, right?

45:20.000 --> 45:25.000
Or you're the guy who's just like, uh, no, no games was, you know, and so I thought we

45:25.000 --> 45:26.720
actually were very pleasant to each other.

45:26.720 --> 45:27.720
Oh yeah.

45:27.720 --> 45:28.720
Sure.

45:28.720 --> 45:31.200
Cause I will be in that, that I was like cool under fire, but I definitely was not going

45:31.200 --> 45:36.080
to be at the level where I'm like thinking of how I can psych Horatio Sansa of the part.

45:36.080 --> 45:39.680
I was, I was just like, yeah, I was just, yeah, playing, playing in simple nervous.

45:39.680 --> 45:43.760
And I really was like, I, I, I be, because I was like, you know what, he's right for

45:43.760 --> 45:44.760
this part.

45:44.760 --> 45:45.760
He's been on SNL.

45:45.760 --> 45:46.760
I'm done.

45:46.760 --> 45:49.840
Like I really thought I was going to like coast in under the radar because I'm, you know,

45:49.840 --> 45:51.120
I'm not, I'm not fishing for anything.

45:51.120 --> 45:52.560
I'm not, I'm not from that world.

45:52.560 --> 45:53.560
I'm not an actor.

45:53.560 --> 45:57.840
And I can't, I can't believe that, that world, that being an actor in particular, which is

45:57.840 --> 46:01.600
one of the thousand things we could just talk about nothing else, this idea that you're in

46:01.600 --> 46:04.600
charge of everything, but you control nothing.

46:04.600 --> 46:11.080
Like you, how do you deal with helplessness and the ego crushing like, do you keep a penny

46:11.080 --> 46:16.000
in your pocket and just press it into your palm or, uh, luckily I do a lot of improv.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.840
So I get to kind of write my own stuff through, through improv.

46:20.840 --> 46:25.560
Uh, so that kind of keeps you from going a little crazy, but, um, and now, now I'm at

46:25.560 --> 46:28.880
a time where I don't have to take stuff if I don't really like it.

46:28.880 --> 46:35.080
So, um, I do, I do well enough not to have to be homeless.

46:35.080 --> 46:38.520
You're, you're, you're definitely, and this is where we can get, maybe I'll be prying

46:38.520 --> 46:44.280
or whatever, but, but what I've heard kind of the legend of you, you're, you're, you're

46:44.280 --> 46:48.840
actually born in, in, in Chile, but you're, you're, you're from Chicago and all the ways

46:48.840 --> 46:53.280
that matter, including the fact that you were like a, you were a party guy, like you could,

46:53.280 --> 46:58.000
you had a wooden leg or what do they call it, how a leg, you could, you could, you

46:58.000 --> 47:01.920
could knock back the, the sauce like, yeah, yeah, I was really good.

47:01.920 --> 47:02.920
Yeah.

47:02.920 --> 47:08.000
Um, and, and, and then you, and then you just, and then you quit and this, and it's not a

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
fluke.

47:09.000 --> 47:14.600
You lost a hundred pounds and like you, you've credited it to, to changing that about your

47:14.600 --> 47:16.040
lifestyle and all that stuff.

47:16.040 --> 47:20.160
And like you look like you're 25 now and like, and it's been that way for a long time.

47:20.160 --> 47:23.120
So I don't, I don't have to worry about me pointing that out, like knocking you off

47:23.120 --> 47:24.120
the wagon.

47:24.120 --> 47:25.120
No, no, no.

47:25.120 --> 47:26.120
Yeah.

47:26.120 --> 47:32.280
It is that it is a, it was that, and it's different, um, to, to go around and be, uh,

47:32.280 --> 47:36.280
different looking, but it's, it's kind of great cause I think I'd be dead if I didn't

47:36.280 --> 47:37.280
do it.

47:37.280 --> 47:39.280
Did you stop drinking?

47:39.280 --> 47:40.880
Uh, like 10 years ago, I think.

47:40.880 --> 47:41.880
Yeah.

47:41.880 --> 47:44.120
Cause I think I've, I've been out like, we used to drink a lot.

47:44.120 --> 47:45.120
Yeah.

47:45.120 --> 47:46.120
We used to like rust, rust again days.

47:46.120 --> 47:47.120
Yeah.

47:47.120 --> 47:49.120
You used to carry a case.

47:49.120 --> 47:50.120
I did.

47:50.120 --> 47:51.120
I'm at the executor.

47:51.120 --> 47:52.120
Yeah.

47:52.120 --> 47:53.120
Yeah.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.120
Yeah.

47:54.120 --> 47:56.120
He had a case with, with shock glasses and absinthe.

47:56.120 --> 47:57.120
This is cool.

47:57.120 --> 48:00.560
Like 1950s, 60s, like mad men kind of things.

48:00.560 --> 48:01.560
Yeah.

48:01.560 --> 48:05.000
And you open up in their velvet line and there's little tumblers and ice spoons and whatnot

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
and they're really groovy.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Really cool.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.880
And the level of, like it's called the dipsomaniacs delight.

48:10.880 --> 48:15.000
That's, that's, that's not one of the old ads for the executor.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
What is it?

48:16.000 --> 48:19.200
Dipsomaniacs was out of the fifties word for alcoholic or what was the, I guess, is it,

48:19.200 --> 48:20.200
is it a drinker?

48:20.200 --> 48:21.200
Yeah.

48:21.200 --> 48:22.200
Yeah.

48:22.200 --> 48:23.200
A heavy drinker.

48:23.200 --> 48:24.200
A compotator.

48:24.200 --> 48:28.640
Um, are you, are you, are you, are you truly, truly like cold turkey sober or did you just

48:28.640 --> 48:30.680
go like, okay, this isn't going to be my lifestyle anymore?

48:30.680 --> 48:31.680
Is there, is it possible?

48:31.680 --> 48:36.080
I, I went cold turkey and then I went to AA meetings for a while and, uh, and they were

48:36.080 --> 48:41.520
kind of fascinating because the characters were just, uh, insane, uh, really.

48:41.520 --> 48:45.080
And I kind of almost got addicted to going just to see the people tell their stories.

48:45.080 --> 48:49.000
Cause, you know, they're always just like, and then, uh, when I was blowing that cop,

48:49.000 --> 48:54.000
I was like, enough, enough, you know, and I really had to take account of what I was

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
up to.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
Yeah.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
Fucking good.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
Yeah.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
And then there's this guy, this guy who, who talked like this, you know, and I'm not

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
going to say anything about it.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.800
You know, I just like, you know, I did it this girl.

49:03.800 --> 49:04.800
I'm not going to, yeah.

49:04.800 --> 49:05.800
Hey, you know what?

49:05.800 --> 49:06.800
I hit her once.

49:06.800 --> 49:07.800
Okay.

49:07.800 --> 49:08.800
Okay.

49:08.800 --> 49:09.800
I got that.

49:09.800 --> 49:11.800
And then there's just like this fucking alcoholic is in there just talking about beating up

49:11.800 --> 49:17.800
ladies and everybody's like, come on now, that's beyond being an alcoholic, just a fucking

49:17.800 --> 49:18.800
maniac.

49:18.800 --> 49:24.800
Um, all right.

49:24.800 --> 49:32.800
So boat trip, boat trip, let's go back because I want to get lost in this.

49:32.800 --> 49:34.640
All right.

49:34.640 --> 49:38.920
So let me just say right now, um, who wrote the film?

49:38.920 --> 49:43.640
I sometimes when I talk about this movie, there is a little pride in it and it also is a lot

49:43.640 --> 49:44.640
of shame.

49:44.640 --> 49:48.040
Uh, and one thing I feel too right now is like, I start giving people's names out.

49:48.040 --> 49:55.640
It's like, it's like the Nuremberg trials, you know, who else, who else was involved?

49:55.640 --> 50:04.240
Uh, like your, your agents on the back, did you tell them that you changed agency?

50:04.240 --> 50:05.240
And in fact, I did.

50:05.240 --> 50:13.720
I know a couple of the writers are rumored to be hiding in Argentina to this day.

50:13.720 --> 50:15.320
Very, very nice guys.

50:15.320 --> 50:22.040
One of them, um, the director was, um, a very nice man called Mort Nathan and he was kind

50:22.040 --> 50:28.400
of, he had rounded up a, a cadre of writers from, from where he worked, which was the

50:28.400 --> 50:31.280
golden girls.

50:31.280 --> 50:37.800
So the guy who writes for the golden girls, I'm like, well, golden girl's pretty good.

50:37.800 --> 50:39.280
Mitch Hurwitz worked on golden girls.

50:39.280 --> 50:40.280
Yeah.

50:40.280 --> 50:41.280
No worries there.

50:41.280 --> 50:43.280
Oh, and then, uh, keep a good junior.

50:43.280 --> 50:46.720
Like you had mentioned on the podcast, he'd won Oscar and then 30 seconds later made this

50:46.720 --> 50:49.880
movie and sank his career.

50:49.880 --> 50:52.680
It felt like for him, nine, nine movies came out at the same time.

50:52.680 --> 50:57.840
It's almost like he somehow like the, the, like they rushed, uh, Jerry McGuire out or

50:57.840 --> 51:03.000
something and it actually was made, wait, I'm not, I'm not, I'm getting my timeline

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
right.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.440
But it was just weird cause it was like boat trip and talking dogs and like, like, like

51:07.440 --> 51:11.600
he was a guy that found a genie in space and like, like it all came out like, um, it felt

51:11.600 --> 51:13.440
like it came out a month after Jerry McGuire.

51:13.440 --> 51:14.440
Anyway.

51:14.440 --> 51:15.440
Yeah.

51:15.440 --> 51:21.000
And I think, I think at that time after the Oscar, I think he had this thing where it's

51:21.000 --> 51:24.320
like just wire $3 million into my bank account.

51:24.320 --> 51:28.600
And if it's there in the morning, I'll meet you in Italy and we'll make this movie.

51:28.600 --> 51:30.880
Um, it was that kind of thing.

51:30.880 --> 51:36.160
And to understand why you have to understand the tragic story of Cuba, good and senior.

51:36.160 --> 51:37.160
Yeah.

51:37.160 --> 51:40.440
He was a revolutionary.

51:40.440 --> 51:42.680
A lot of people call them Cuba batting.

51:42.680 --> 51:52.000
Uh, that's how I heard his like, please do you, you keep talking please and no matter

51:52.000 --> 51:58.240
how bad the story gets, it won't matter cause I'm using chicken, chicken, chicken times.

51:58.240 --> 52:00.640
Um, yeah.

52:00.640 --> 52:10.120
So it was, I think the summer of, um, 99, I think maybe I remember having to, I remember

52:10.120 --> 52:18.680
I was asked to promote boat trip, um, a week after 9 11, um, they were like, just come on

52:18.680 --> 52:19.680
and take pictures.

52:19.680 --> 52:22.240
I'm like, dude, it's 9 12.

52:22.240 --> 52:27.080
I don't really want to be on a plane and I'm like, it's not that I'm afraid that right

52:27.080 --> 52:31.360
now every plane is going to blow up, but I don't want to be in a plane thinking about

52:31.360 --> 52:36.440
the fact that two days ago I saw the second tower collapse in lower Manhattan.

52:36.440 --> 52:39.960
Um, so that's just a little side note.

52:39.960 --> 52:43.040
Um, there was, there was a looming writer strike.

52:43.040 --> 52:44.040
Do you remember this?

52:44.040 --> 52:45.040
Yeah.

52:45.040 --> 52:46.040
Yes.

52:46.040 --> 52:47.040
So you had already made the film or you had not made the film?

52:47.040 --> 52:48.040
I had not made the film.

52:48.040 --> 52:49.040
I'm going back.

52:49.040 --> 52:53.920
I had to promote it, but, but go back to whatever it was, 99, uh, there was going to be a writer

52:53.920 --> 52:54.920
strike that summer.

52:54.920 --> 52:58.280
So everybody was like, you got to do a movie, you got to do a movie.

52:58.280 --> 53:01.520
And this was one of those movies, one of those, you got to do a movie because they might

53:01.520 --> 53:05.200
not make another movie for two years and you're going to be back in a cell and you can only

53:05.200 --> 53:06.920
do it in this window.

53:06.920 --> 53:13.280
So Cuba Gooding, uh, the script was pretty bad when I first read it, but I was told that

53:13.280 --> 53:19.280
I would be able to help rewrite it and I didn't get a chance to do that.

53:19.280 --> 53:22.800
Um, it's just not allowed to do that.

53:22.800 --> 53:23.800
It's weird.

53:23.800 --> 53:25.120
Someone in a show business kind of pulled a trick on me.

53:25.120 --> 53:26.120
I don't know.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.120
Yeah.

53:27.120 --> 53:31.000
Um, we're just like, they just didn't even realize what they were saying.

53:31.000 --> 53:36.080
Sometimes I feel like agents, I hesitate to say my agent who I've trusted for like almost

53:36.080 --> 53:41.680
20 years, but like all agents, like they, it's not that they're lying as much as it is.

53:41.680 --> 53:46.760
Like they just don't, their priorities are so skewed that they don't, they don't know

53:46.760 --> 53:47.920
that they're lying.

53:47.920 --> 53:50.440
Maybe they don't, they don't want to think about them.

53:50.440 --> 53:51.440
You're right.

53:51.440 --> 53:52.440
Yeah.

53:52.440 --> 53:55.160
They just, they are convinced when they tell you that the right thing to do is this or

53:55.160 --> 53:56.160
that.

53:56.160 --> 53:59.280
Like they do, they, they, because they have lots of mythology to back them up.

53:59.280 --> 54:03.640
Like they're like, you know what, you know, who's picky about his roles, Hitler, I don't

54:03.640 --> 54:04.640
know.

54:04.640 --> 54:12.480
Like they offered him a, he would have been like Johnny Weissmuller.

54:12.480 --> 54:17.600
They were looking for a new Tarzan and Hitler passed because he thought it would be tacky.

54:17.600 --> 54:18.600
You know what's tacky?

54:18.600 --> 54:19.600
Killing six million Jews.

54:19.600 --> 54:20.600
Absolutely.

54:20.600 --> 54:23.280
So anyways, are you enjoying the flat bread?

54:23.280 --> 54:24.280
I love this place.

54:24.280 --> 54:25.280
That was, I'm sorry.

54:25.280 --> 54:26.280
I was in the scene.

54:26.280 --> 54:27.280
I was in the scene.

54:27.280 --> 54:28.280
I was, I was your agent.

54:28.280 --> 54:29.280
Are we set?

54:29.280 --> 54:37.520
My space wreck was so good that a UCB guy was like lost.

54:37.520 --> 54:41.600
Or it was so bad that a professional professor was like, why are you do so good?

54:41.600 --> 54:43.400
I thought someone had flat bread over here.

54:43.400 --> 54:44.760
I'm like, that's, that's weird.

54:44.760 --> 54:46.360
These guys are eating flat bread.

54:46.360 --> 54:47.360
All right.

54:47.360 --> 54:48.360
So sorry.

54:48.360 --> 54:49.360
I don't know why I keep interrupting.

54:49.360 --> 54:51.160
Like I'm like, they won't know it's my show.

54:51.160 --> 54:53.040
Tell the story of boat trip.

54:53.040 --> 54:55.640
Let me shut the fuck up.

54:55.640 --> 54:59.760
So I get a call and they're saying that, well, if you don't do it, Artie Lang is going to

54:59.760 --> 55:01.160
do it.

55:01.160 --> 55:04.440
And, and then they're like, Roger Moore is in it.

55:04.440 --> 55:06.320
And I was like, fuck, I love Roger Moore.

55:06.320 --> 55:09.600
He was my bond, you know, my age coincides with that bond.

55:09.600 --> 55:13.760
So I'm like, I'll be able to do scenes with, with my bond.

55:13.760 --> 55:21.280
So I, I slept on it and I had a dream where Abraham Lincoln, this is no lie.

55:21.280 --> 55:33.160
In this dream, Abraham Lincoln says, um, don't do things for money.

55:33.160 --> 55:34.320
It's all I ever did.

55:34.320 --> 55:37.760
Now I'm on two kinds of them.

55:37.760 --> 55:44.600
I, if I had held out, I jumped on the penny.

55:44.600 --> 55:51.000
I didn't know the $5 bill was going to get pitched to me.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.560
I said I wouldn't talk.

55:52.560 --> 55:53.560
No, no, please do.

55:53.560 --> 55:56.000
Cause there has to be funny things talked about.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.880
Abe Lincoln, Abe Lincoln said, don't do things for money.

55:57.880 --> 56:01.520
And that's your, that's your Abe Lincoln voice who's never been recorded.

56:01.520 --> 56:06.640
So we don't know, but that's your, I prefer that it's not like, like, like, like, um,

56:06.640 --> 56:09.640
Minnie Mouse or something, you know, they say you had a high pitched.

56:09.640 --> 56:10.640
Yeah.

56:10.640 --> 56:11.640
Yeah.

56:11.640 --> 56:12.640
But I want to talk to you.

56:12.640 --> 56:13.640
He talked like David.

56:13.640 --> 56:14.640
No.

56:14.640 --> 56:16.800
Can we talk to your Abe Lincoln just for a little bit more?

56:16.800 --> 56:19.040
I just want to like, like, I'm your roommate.

56:19.040 --> 56:20.840
Like, uh, I don't know how I worry.

56:20.840 --> 56:27.280
Uh, listen Abe, the, um, the lint trap in the machine, the dryer fills up.

56:27.280 --> 56:30.360
So after every load, you have to like clean it out.

56:30.360 --> 56:36.400
Oh, that's good to make bedding, right?

56:36.400 --> 56:38.520
You're from a more, you're from a more resourceful time.

56:38.520 --> 56:39.520
Oh yeah.

56:39.520 --> 56:40.520
Yeah.

56:40.520 --> 56:46.400
We'd sleep two to a bed, um, you know, I'd prefer if we didn't, but I noticed you did

56:46.400 --> 56:49.920
last night and I'm not homophobic.

56:49.920 --> 56:53.200
There is another bedroom in the apartment for you.

56:53.200 --> 56:54.200
Yeah.

56:54.200 --> 56:55.200
And I like it.

56:55.200 --> 56:56.200
I like it.

56:56.200 --> 56:58.200
I like that you're free about stuff.

56:58.200 --> 56:59.200
Yeah.

56:59.200 --> 57:02.640
You know, where I'm, where I'm from, slavery was cool.

57:02.640 --> 57:03.640
Yeah.

57:03.640 --> 57:09.400
Um, oh, that's, uh, no, it's not, um, so things, you know, things change.

57:09.400 --> 57:15.520
So I'm really, I'm really happy with like, you know, this gay marriage situation.

57:15.520 --> 57:22.320
We couldn't dream of doing that when I was with old Mary Todd, you know, although I did

57:22.320 --> 57:23.320
kind of broke your heart.

57:23.320 --> 57:26.320
I must have kind of broke your heart when Horatio made that movie.

57:26.320 --> 57:28.320
Oh, Lincoln.

57:28.320 --> 57:29.320
No.

57:29.320 --> 57:33.520
Are we in the present right now?

57:33.520 --> 57:34.520
Are we back?

57:34.520 --> 57:35.520
Are we back?

57:35.520 --> 57:37.880
Didn't you, didn't you say you transported into Horatio Sands's dream last night and

57:37.880 --> 57:39.840
warned him not to do things for money?

57:39.840 --> 57:40.840
And I read it.

57:40.840 --> 57:42.000
I just read the trades today.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.200
He's he ignored me.

57:43.200 --> 57:44.200
He's doing it.

57:44.200 --> 57:50.400
He's doing a sex farce in Germany with German people.

57:50.400 --> 57:54.800
You took, you took such, I've never seen you Abe in the, in the six months we've been living

57:54.800 --> 58:00.440
together, uh, since we met through Craigslist, uh, I've never seen you take such an active

58:00.440 --> 58:03.040
interest in a modern, uh, American performer.

58:03.040 --> 58:05.160
Like I, I, uh, what was it about you and Horatio?

58:05.160 --> 58:09.840
Well, it's just the right time, you know, like, oh, I know he's from Illinois.

58:09.840 --> 58:10.840
I'm from Illinois.

58:10.840 --> 58:11.840
Oh, that's one of this.

58:11.840 --> 58:12.840
Yeah.

58:12.840 --> 58:13.840
Yeah.

58:13.840 --> 58:18.280
And he was in some drunk Ambien haze and was like, uh, Lincoln, what should I do?

58:18.280 --> 58:21.640
I told him, I told him what I would do.

58:21.640 --> 58:26.200
So, okay, okay, ending the, ending the scene, but because that's a really interesting concept.

58:26.200 --> 58:30.200
So when this is because this is really actually true for what we understand of psychology,

58:30.200 --> 58:32.840
unless you believe the ghost of Lincoln came to your dream.

58:32.840 --> 58:33.840
I don't.

58:33.840 --> 58:39.520
The funnier, the more, the more poetic truth is that in your mind, you saw my mind was

58:39.520 --> 58:40.840
figuring it out for me.

58:40.840 --> 58:41.840
It was doing it.

58:41.840 --> 58:44.080
You conjured the icon of integrity.

58:44.080 --> 58:45.080
Yeah.

58:45.080 --> 58:46.080
Yeah.

58:46.080 --> 58:53.120
I wanted, I created this, this character in my brain to tell me in my sleep to not do

58:53.120 --> 58:54.120
this movie.

58:54.120 --> 59:02.600
And I ignored it, but, but, but yeah, and I, I, I, I could spend the next half hour, uh,

59:02.600 --> 59:06.880
like, you don't need to be left off the hook for that, right?

59:06.880 --> 59:11.800
Like, you don't feel, you don't feel like you made like a bad, like, do you feel bad

59:11.800 --> 59:12.800
about it?

59:12.800 --> 59:20.600
I do feel, no, I feel bad about, uh, I feel bad that it's a joke, um, no, please, no.

59:20.600 --> 59:25.320
But it was much like when I played a mariachi on Saturday Night Live, you know, I was like,

59:25.320 --> 59:28.200
it's okay because people see me in other things.

59:28.200 --> 59:31.600
So boat trip has become okay because I've done many other things where I've been able

59:31.600 --> 59:35.160
to be funny and, and, and happy with what I did.

59:35.160 --> 59:41.240
Uh, people still come up to me and tell me about boat trip, um, mostly Puerto Rican and

59:41.240 --> 59:46.920
black people, um, in New York, they all love that movie.

59:46.920 --> 59:55.080
Um, and also when I went, um, I did a show in Iraq and, uh, and, uh, the soldiers told

59:55.080 --> 59:58.120
me that part of their welcome bag was boat trip.

59:58.120 --> 01:00:05.920
So, so I have a lot of fans in Iraq and I signed a bunch of boat trip DVDs.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:12.280
Uh, but that was kind of fitting also that I was in Iraq and just like seeing what a

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.200
mess this whole fucking thing was.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.200
Right.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:19.120
Because they were, you were there at 9-Eleven, saw the buildings collapsing and now you were

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:24.440
in the boat trip of the, of the, of 9-Eleven, which is the Iraq war.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.440
Yeah.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:30.600
The, the, the result of the White House not listening to Abe Lincoln.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:36.200
All of this was, if I had just listened to Abe Lincoln, there would be no terrorism.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.200
It just, this was just a string of events that happened.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.320
Oh wait, no, I don't know how you try, I didn't mean to imply that.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:50.240
I think you can correlate when I decided to do boat trip with the beginning of, of, of

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.040
the, of the terrorist planning.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.040
No.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:58.400
Um, there's a lot of conspiracies about it, but Jeff, yes.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.040
All right, so you, you say, yes, I'll do the movie.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:06.440
And uh, day one, like, how was, what, what was the vibe on the set?

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.520
Like was it, did you, did you know?

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:11.400
I knew pretty right away that it was, it was off.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.400
It was, it was not working.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.400
Yeah.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:20.280
Uh, like I had to, I flew from, uh, from New York and had to be like there that morning.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.000
So I didn't really sleep.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.320
And then it was just, uh, what, what I thought was going to be a thing where we can like

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.200
look at the script the night before and maybe work on some scenes was just like, we do two

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:35.280
takes, one for you and then one where you improvise.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.640
So, so basically, uh, we know what, what I was told wasn't happening.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.720
So it was very, very under the gun filmmaking.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:48.640
It was a half the crew was German cause it was a half German production and they, and

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.840
they hated us and we hated them.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.400
Um, and what else happened?

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.400
Well, it's the scene cause I, uh, oh yeah, yeah.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.400
Let's talk about the scene.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.000
I want to know the scene when all the jizz flies out the portal and lands on, as it lands

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.400
on Roger Moore, who gets hit with the jizz?

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:08.400
Oh, his name is, there he is.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.400
Sorry.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.400
I mean, it's been a while since we've seen him.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.400
Yes, your honor.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.400
Hold on a second.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.400
I'm peeking.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.080
And was he told he was in a jizz joke?

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.080
He knew.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.080
Yes.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.080
But something about Mary had a jizz joke.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:26.640
He had a chance to say no, uh, they asked him if he wanted to be the guy that caught

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.640
the jizz.

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:32.160
Uh, Eleanor Rosenfeld came to him in a dream anyway.

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.280
He was one of the writers it was on.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.720
And so the porthole, the porthole scene, but rewinding because the, the reason he's coming

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:46.000
out the porthole and you kids can rent this this week, um, the, if you haven't, if I'm

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:53.320
not mistaken, the reason Cuba is coming out the porthole is because he, this is the culmination

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:58.320
of him pretending to be gay so that he can be close to this to Vivica Fox.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.320
Is that right?

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.320
Yes.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.320
And she starts eating a banana.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.320
She starts eating the banana.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.760
So the banana is the most important thing.

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:07.640
If a bus was coming through this wall before I got out of the way or pushed you out of

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.520
the way, I would go, but the banana.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.520
Tell me about the banana.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.520
Okay.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.520
Oh yeah.

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.520
The banana.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.520
Because I don't want to die without it.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:19.120
I don't want to live without the banana in high death.

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:24.240
When she's eating the banana, it appears, the banana is chiseled into the, I didn't

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.000
know this, but of a debt, well, you weren't even, you know, it weren't in that scene.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.800
And I do want to say like, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not saying this in like a, in a, I don't

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.800
know.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.840
I feel like there's a similar, we had Dana Carvey on the show who I was like at the time

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.640
taking out on this pitch and like, like he's amazing stuff and he, he expressed so much

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.440
like, there's a, there's a sad side to this, which has nothing to do with like whether

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.880
or not, it's the, the, the idea that there's a human cost, the idea that you actually feel

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.280
still that you feel when people are like, that you feel like you, that, that, that,

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.760
that you, that you did something wrong or that you have a lower quality to your, your

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.760
worth.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.760
Yeah.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.760
A little bit.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.760
Just from a choice.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.640
Anybody might have, look at the, the reason the population of the earth is eight billion

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:11.800
is because everybody makes bad choices with the most, the most important thing you could

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:16.800
ever choose of all is whether or not you should fuck somebody and we have a 70% divorce rate.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.640
Like, like we, we don't like, like we're, we're human mistakes.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.240
You can't know that's not your job to know you're an actor.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.240
Well, thank you.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:29.240
It's not, it's not like a Horatio, Horatio Sands and Kuban Gooding are the, the, the,

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.800
the, the, those like you guys had a two man comedy trip and you're like, we want to make

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:33.800
this movie.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:34.800
Right.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.800
Even then that would have been amazing.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800
Yeah.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:40.920
But I feel like, you know, as a, as a comedian and someone who's a social critic, I guess

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:46.920
just by, by, by being a comedian, you know, you, you, uh, you have to take your, you know,

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.080
you have to take your shots.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:52.040
Like I, I, I could, I would still like to tell people that I care about, like this sucks

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:57.000
and this is why I don't like it, but it has made it a little difficult because that is

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
attached to me.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.880
So in a way it's kind of humbled me in a way, um, which can't be bad.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:03.880
No, no.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:04.880
That could only be good.

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.880
No.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:06.880
And like you said, it is true.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:07.880
Like if that's what I really,

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:12.360
Like nobody watching that movie blames you for any of what went wrong with that film.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:13.360
You're fine in it.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.360
It's just, it's the movies.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.360
It's the culprit here.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.200
And so as you said, like the fact that the crew is half German, I mean, that's the, that's

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:23.080
the part where you start to go like, oh yeah, like, because that's how weird it feels.

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:28.760
Like I said, like people, it's, it's, it's not like, geely, like it's, it's, it's, which

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:29.760
I have never seen.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.160
So why did I just shit all over that movie?

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:36.840
But I, it's a historically like, I, there's, there's stories of hubris behind, behind historically

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.440
bad movies, movies of like so-and-so thought he was such king shit that he thought he'd

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.440
do this.

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:45.160
This was the first time director and now we know a half German crew.

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:53.800
And, and, and we were shooting in, in Brussels as, we were shooting in Germany as LA.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.160
And then when we went on the boat trip, we actually did go on a boat.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:02.080
So half, half the crew was, half the people on the boat were making this film and then

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:09.520
the other people didn't know, so, so they were really mad that, you know, we were shooting,

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.360
you know, in the, in the hot tub.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:17.120
We were closing up the hot tub in the pool and they weren't really mad at us, but, but

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.680
you weren't, you weren't on set for the banana scene.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.320
Did you, I mean, what do you know about the banana?

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.240
The Vivica Fox is eating a banana.

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:29.000
The joke is that she's showing him how she, she's not actually showing him how she eats

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.520
a banana and it's ironically, like dick-sucking, she's showing him how she gives a blow job,

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.520
right?

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.800
She's, she's demonstrating with a banana.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.800
Yeah.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.200
That's that, that thing in a date that happens when you're on a date and the woman starts

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.640
showing you how she would blow you on a piece of fruit.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.080
This is something women do with gay men, too, all the time.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.080
It's like, oh, you're gay.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:55.400
Well, let me just like rub my tits on you and talk about sucking dick and, um, like,

01:06:55.400 --> 01:07:00.400
the, the, the, the, and, and, but the weirdest thing of all, like, like, which is why you

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:05.320
should never have to worry about the movie reflecting on you at all because it's surreal.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:08.280
The whole movie from front to back is absolutely surreal.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:12.440
You might as well just be in a Jackson Pollock painting, like waving, like, like, like, like,

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:16.480
like, like, like 10 years from now, we may find out this movie's good.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.480
That's how fucking weird it is.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:24.120
Um, the, the, but, and one of the weird things about it is the banana that she's demonstrating

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:30.320
a filet show on in the, the, it cuts in close and she's like looking at, and for some reason,

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:39.040
the prop master has shaped the head of the banana into a, like, very faithful, like,

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.560
like, like helmet of a cock.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:50.800
So the joke is that somehow God created these wonderful, uh, fruit and that the, the joke

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.280
is that, look, it came out looking like a real dick.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:57.640
So it's perfect.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.200
It should be sucked on, but that's, but the, right?

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:04.320
Cause I don't, I actually, I don't really remember.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.480
It's just such a weird thing to have.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.480
I've not watched it on HD.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.880
It's such a strange afterthought.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:13.280
And then it's been so long since I've seen it, but my, my mind, then there's just a snowball

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:18.280
effect of wild shit starts happening and he's like trying to keep it in his pants and sublimate

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:24.440
his hornyness and while she turns her back, he just unleashes what I recall as being like

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.280
a half a gallon of gum.

01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:31.200
Well, it was, if you want to know the truth, it was grosser than that cause it was a, not

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.840
a realistic amount, but like a bucket would have been then it would have taken you to

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:39.080
Dracula dead and loving it territory to be like, well, that's silly.

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:45.720
Nobody comes that much, but it was disgusting because he, he would thrust his hips out the

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:51.680
port hole and goes, oh, and in my, in my, in my, in my memory for no reason, just because

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:53.200
it seems like something that should happen.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:09:00.200
The ship's horn goes, yeah, yeah, and then it cuts to outside and apparently the port

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:05.880
hole is above people who are on deck enjoying the night air.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:13.520
And one of the actors has a semi realistic amount of pure white, thick, come sunscreen.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.040
Yeah, well, it looks like sunscreen.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.040
It really does.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:21.720
Falls on his face and then they make a joke like, like, oh, there's a bird out here.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:27.040
And the weird thing is, if you thought a bird shit on your face, you'd react almost the

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:31.040
same as if you knew a man came on your face.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.600
But because it's come, the irony has to be there.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:37.560
So they're like, oh, it's a bird, Ellie's darn birds, which you would never do if a

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:45.200
bird shit on your face, and it was more like that silent film, like, whereas if you had

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:50.880
a gigantic load like that, it would feel like a snowball in your eye.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:57.600
And you'd be like, oh, I want to say, I know that the actor that it was, it wasn't Patrick,

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.600
was it?

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.600
I think a friend of mine was in there.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.600
I can't think of who it was.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:08.360
He was a second city actor who was there in the 70s, and he's, I'm sorry, I can't think

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.360
of it.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:13.440
But he wrote on Golden Girls with, so he was just a guy who was hanging out as an actor

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.760
and they're like, hey, you want to do that part?

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:19.640
He's like, all right, fuckers, I'll do it, and then that's how it happened.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.640
That's a good story.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:24.320
I was the guy that got the jizz on the head.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:30.320
And it must have been great to work with Roger Moore, because he's Roger Moore no matter

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.760
what, and he was in that movie.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:35.480
Yeah, he has that Bob Saget thing, where he just says filthy things all the time, just

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:42.480
so that you don't think that he's the proper real James Bond.

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:49.120
Which you and I, the joke's on us, because we both thought Roger Moore was the real James

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:55.520
Bond, and then you grow up, like now we're looking back through the lens of all of our

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.600
friends who are aggregators of James Bond culture, and it's like, oh, Roger Moore was

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.680
like the Adam West of James Bond.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.480
But you and I were like, that's James Bond.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.200
He was the one in space.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:09.520
You'd watch the Sean Connery ones, and you'd be like, ugh, I can't believe they let this

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:14.160
go on long enough to get their act together, with the duty to kill.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.280
Sean Connery's not really funny in those films, right?

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.280
He's rye.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:26.800
The movie's got increasingly campy with Roger Moore's influence, and he was the saint, right?

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:27.800
Yeah.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:33.640
That's, Roger Moore is like, he's the guy who kind of coincided with the gadgets, right?

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:36.000
Moreover, they had gadgets in the Sean Connery movie.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.880
I'm talking out of my ass.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.880
Matt Gorley, well, Matt Gorley is a guest, at least.

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:44.320
There was always gadgets in that bit, but they weren't just camp with Connery.

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:48.800
He cracked a lot of jokes and one-liners, and mostly about pussy and stuff.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.800
Yeah.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.800
Yeah, you'll eat pussy.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.800
What was it?

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.800
I'm pussy galore.

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.800
He goes, I noticed.

01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:58.800
Yeah, not...

01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.800
How would he notice?

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:00.800
That's so clever.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:01.800
What does that fucking mean?

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:02.800
Also, not even...

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:05.800
Oh, pussy lips are sticking out of your pants.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:06.800
What?

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.800
You've got an enormous amount of pussy.

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:15.800
You have a truly gigantic pussy.

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.400
The funny thing would be if she called him on like, well, that's not very clever, and

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.800
he'd be like, either is your name.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:25.800
I'm, yes, ending on its level.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:26.800
Pussy galore.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.800
Yeah, I noticed.

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:31.800
Don't make me fucking carry your weight.

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:36.800
You can't do better than pussy galore, and I'm supposed to be like, readal-tittle-doo.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.800
I'm supposed to like, 20, 23 skidoo.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:45.800
I'm supposed to either let that pass or come up with the world's best pussy galore joke.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.800
Yeah.

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:49.800
It's not making me the bad guy in this conversation.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:55.800
Your name might as well be Bucket Suck-a-Dick.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.800
So, yeah, I noticed.

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:58.800
That's what you get.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:12:59.800
I noticed.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.800
That's what I've heard.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.800
My name is Suck-a-Dick.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.800
Bucket Suck-a-Dick.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:09.800
Okay.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.800
All right.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.800
My name's James Bond.

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.800
Let's get to work.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.800
There's the world's at stake, first of all.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.800
Apparently, I don't know why.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.800
The beginning scenes are always really confusing.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.800
I did Matt Gorley, and, oh, check out the guy's name on the podcast.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:27.800
It's a Bond one.

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:28.800
Oh, he's a go-kill-me.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:29.800
Jeremy Carter.

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:30.800
No, not Jeremy Carter.

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:31.800
Matt Myra.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:32.800
They do the, um...

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:33.800
Matt Mira.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.800
Yeah.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.800
And we did the podcast, and we did Man with the Golden Gun.

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.800
And there was some straight-up woman beating in that movie.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:40.800
It takes a really weird turn.

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.800
He just sort of boxing this chick around.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.800
It's like, that's not sexy.

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.800
And yet, just 23 years ago?

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.800
Super, super hot.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:54.800
There was a...

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.800
Oh, never mind.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.800
I can't remember, and then I'll fumble around for it.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.800
So, Horatio, so the movie is finished.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.800
How long did it take to shoot the whole thing?

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:04.800
Three months.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:05.800
Three months.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.800
And so, you...

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.800
Was there a big screening, a big hu-ha?

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:10.800
Hollywood screening and all that?

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.800
Yeah, I think there was, like, around 9-11.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:15.800
Like, after...

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:16.800
Like, this...

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.800
I think this came out the spring of, uh...

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.800
Okay.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.800
2002.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.800
The world was ready for a laugh at that.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:23.800
They wanted it.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:24.800
Yeah.

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:31.800
Did you approve of the idea of having the red carpet go right through Ground Zero?

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.800
Like...

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:38.800
I know a lot of people cited that as, like, one of the things that they were put off by.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.800
I was like, why does the red carpet have to go through the middle of Ground Zero and

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.800
then bank back around to a theater, which is, like, a mile away?

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.800
Yeah, they said that we're actually, like, doing construction stuff in there, and we're

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.800
like, please postpone construction.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:55.800
Let us have our premiere.

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.800
This is a celebration of New York.

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:05.800
Uh, you know, this country is the acceptance of the gay human beings, and, you know, it

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:09.800
was all about, like, yeah, about getting them back, is what I like to say, getting back

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:13.800
the Osamers that did that to us.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:18.800
Can you tell whether or not that movie is homophobic when you watch it through, like,

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.800
a 2015 lens?

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:22.800
Because I, like, I can't remember the last time I watched it, but it was, like...

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.800
I know it was, like, in...

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:28.800
Well, the guy who plays a gay guy is just so, like...

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:35.800
He's so out of hand gay that he's wearing, like, makeup and just, like, weird...

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.800
Yeah.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.800
Like, if he was doing a space show in the 60s, you know, that's how gay he is.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:42.800
I think I made the exact...

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.800
I think that's the exact mistake I made on a community episode that was, like, early...

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:47.800
Like, it was...

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.800
I can't remember if it was...

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.800
I think it was season three.

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:52.800
And the...

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.800
Yeah, it was like...

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:54.800
And it was like, we want...

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.800
At our heart, we were trying...

01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:00.800
We wanted to tell a story about, like, worlds coming together and a bigot that stops being

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.800
a bigot because he actually learns these people are human beings, blah-blah-blah.

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:04.800
The...

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:05.800
Blah-blah-blah.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.800
Blah-blah-blah.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.800
Blah-blah-blah.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:08.800
Blah-blah-blah.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.800
This is the most honest thing I've ever said on the stage.

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:17.800
Yes, the truth is, I'm neither homophobic nor an advocate.

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.800
I'm just a fucking narcissist.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.800
Blah-blah-blah.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:26.800
That's the only honest thing I've ever said politically on the stage.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:31.800
Blah-blah-blah in reference to an entire, like, movement.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:37.800
But the mistake that we made, that I didn't even notice we were making it because it's

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:42.800
a sitcom and it's a half hour alarm, was like, yeah, the gay people, they read as gay.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.800
And that was the mistake because it was part of the setup in the story sense.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:50.800
It was like, well, once upon a time there was a bigot and the bigot is a cartoon of a bigot

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.800
because it's a sitcom.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:57.800
And then just, you know, and what we accidentally did, because we weren't even thinking about

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:03.800
it, we weren't trying to create dimensionalized gay characters on our show, we just weren't

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:09.800
thinking about that being a failure if we didn't do that because we were just thinking,

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.800
we were just playing with tinker toys.

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.800
Oh, here's the bigot and here's the gay guy.

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:14.800
We're drobes here.

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:15.800
How should the gay guy dress?

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:16.800
Well, guess what?

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:20.800
Oh, the castings here, who should we cast as the gay guy?

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:21.800
That guy.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:28.800
And it was all in the name of just sort of like, oh, the story will be effective if the ducks

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.800
that are teasing the ugly duckling read as ducks.

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.800
And so they're beautiful.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:39.800
And the swans read as swans because it's hubris and what we found out is like, oh, shit,

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:45.800
the offensive thing, I guess, is like, there's a huge misstep that you could do.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:49.800
A huge misstep that you could do along the way that you're not even trying to do that

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:54.800
actually cuts the same silhouette as bigotry, which is like, oh, you're just doing a caricature.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.800
I mean, I don't know why I'm explaining this.

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.800
Everyone understands that part.

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:02.800
What I'm explaining is that I didn't understand, you know, the way why I would do that, you

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:03.800
know.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:10.800
Yeah, well, even as a comedian trying to make fun of gay people for just funny things that

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.800
they do, you have to be very careful.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:19.800
You can't just say, so I think the mistake is that if you, we see the old caricature of

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:24.800
a gay person on TV in the 70s, which was like completely flaming shirt, open pink, you know,

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:30.800
gold shoes, and then we'll think we're going to make fun of that by making that even more

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.800
ridiculous.

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:36.800
I think that's another mistake people make is just making it super gay because see, we

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.800
know it's a joke, but in the same breath, you have this caricature.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:45.800
Yeah, the idea that, I mean, I think the mistake is like, and that I realize now is that you

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:46.800
have to write up to every character.

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.800
I don't know why I would violate that rule.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:54.800
Like Chevy Chase's character was like, he was, to me, he's a cartoonish because he's

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:59.800
this, you know, he's this crazy character, but I'm also always writing up to that character.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:03.800
And if a gay guy is like walking through the frame and he has five seconds to be gay and

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:09.800
set up a story point, like it's the challenges on me, like to construct a story where, because

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:17.800
if anybody's watching straight or gay, they're like, it's actually, I think the, I guess

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:25.800
I'd summarize the mistake as being like writers tend to, we tend to, we forget that the whole

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:31.800
goal is a diversification, whether or not it's silliness or like, however ridiculous

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:38.800
the joke is or whatever, if it's in the medium of people watching it and listening to it,

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:44.800
like your end goal is that they believe it's real kind of, even a pie fight.

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.800
So it's like, that's funny that it's a pie fight because why would people fight with

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:48.800
pies?

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.800
So I believe they're people and I believe those are pies.

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:57.800
Like, and so if you're, it's dangerous to like do social commentary of any kind, like

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:03.800
you have to rise up to that because now you're using people and groups of people as pies

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:07.800
in a pie fight and you have to like, no, no, no, that needs to read as like actual believable

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:12.800
meringue or you're going to make people, because, because, because like they can see the tin

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.800
hit the face of like those pie fight scenes.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.800
Like now I love my metaphor.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.800
They're like, when it's like clearly just fucking whip topping and I hate when the pie

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.800
fight, just a bunch of whipped cream.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.800
That's, that's not a dish or shaving cream, even worse.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:31.800
When they make shaving cream and how much funnier is that to get hit with a real pie

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.800
and how much funnier maybe would have, you know, there's a, there's nothing wrong with

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:40.800
the concept of, of, of, but there's nothing inherently offensive about, about, about that

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.800
idea at all.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:46.800
It would be, it could be like a masterpiece of whatever, you could say that about anything

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:47.800
you could say that about.

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:52.800
Was there any backlash or like any reaction Horatio from gay community about boat trip?

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:56.800
Um, I mean, positive or negative or indifferent?

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:01.800
I don't think, I don't think they, I don't know, maybe, but I, I don't remember.

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.800
There was never like a big stink up.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.800
No, cause the heart was in the right place.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:12.800
My character learned that gay people were human.

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:13.800
Yeah.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:14.800
How did it wait?

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:15.800
What was your character?

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:16.800
How does your character's arc end?

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:20.800
Does he, does he come out as gay or does he just, uh, accept the?

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:27.800
I accept gays and I think, and I end up hooking up with this, uh, this woman who lives in,

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:34.800
uh, in, in the hills in Sweden, uh, I find her and she's, uh, some sexy thing that for

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.800
some reason was, was there.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.800
So I end up, it ends up okay for me.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:45.080
And in some indirect way that's a, that's a reward for you accepting gays is that you

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:47.800
get to have a pure form of heterosexuality.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:48.800
Exactly.

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:49.800
Yeah.

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:50.800
Yeah.

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.520
Cause there's like some kind of Swedish bikini team or something like literally lands

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.520
on the boat or something.

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:54.520
Yeah.

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:55.520
No, no.

01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:03.880
And then you get on a helicopter, um, with your cum, with, with the whole super cum is

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:09.520
explained in the first five minutes of the movie, and Cuba and I eat these weird, these

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:13.320
weird, these weird donuts that have this stuff that we get super cum.

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:18.520
That's why this, no, uh, wait, where was I?

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:21.520
Well, you were shooting down a helicopter.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.440
Oh, I shot down a hot.

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.520
I had forgotten that I shot this scene.

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:29.200
So when I saw this, I got really high and saw this movie like two years later after I

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:34.240
made it and I'm like, what?

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:38.040
I shoot down a helicopter with a flare gun.

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:39.720
Holy shit.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:44.080
I remember having to act like, okay, the helicopter is falling.

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:49.760
There's a, there's nine models inside the plane of the helicopter you just shot down.

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:50.760
So you don't know what you're going to do.

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:53.440
Oh, you know, you're going to get some help or you're going to jump in the water.

01:22:53.440 --> 01:23:00.040
And it was, uh, yeah, I just, it hit me pretty, pretty hard that I, I, I, I'd shot down a

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:04.760
helicopter in this comedy that we had made.

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:07.040
That was the bridge too far for you in that movie?

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:08.040
Yeah.

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:09.040
Yeah.

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.040
I mean, if you watch that, you've all the believability goes up the window.

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:15.680
It was really at the edge of their seats.

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:17.560
They're like, wow, I hope these guys figure it out.

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:23.720
And then after that, they're like, oh, what the hell, these guys are jokers.

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:28.000
So, so nowadays, and I guess this is where if, if it was like a single camera production,

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.120
it would fade down and the Chiron would say life after boat trip.

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:36.360
So we talk, now we talk about, uh, current things.

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:39.080
I don't, I thought that would be funnier.

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:47.440
Like there would be piano keys playing after, after the boat trip.

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:52.920
Uh, but, but it's like that, that leaf Garrett interview from, uh, Hollywood, each, you Hollywood

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:53.920
story.

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:59.000
Uh, you guys know about leaf Garrett and he, he got drunk and, uh, and then him and his

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.160
buddy got in the car wreck and, uh, his buddy's paralyzed.

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.160
Right.

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:07.920
Oh, and he, and so then he, he talks about it and he's like, I'm like, Paulie, I'm sorry

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.920
man.

01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.640
I never forgive me.

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:16.920
And then Paulie comes out and forgives him, but he looked so fucked up from like the days

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:22.120
when he was a teen idol and then like, he had like a bandana covering cause his hair was

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:26.560
like probably half of it was gone or had been shaved by somebody.

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:27.560
Yeah.

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.560
He's pretty bald.

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.560
Yeah.

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:32.640
So, so yeah, that's that moment right now where I'm talking about shave his hair.

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.560
I mean, it was probably, it probably fell out, right?

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:41.480
Well, shave, like, like shave, like, like you're drugged out and someone's like, oh, you think

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:42.480
he was wearing it?

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:46.640
Like, uh, you thought maybe cause as soon as I saw that, I was like, oh, it's just traditional,

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:50.000
like, like the guy from poison, whatever, you know, it's like that bandana thing.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.600
It's just like, like the weirdest impulses.

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.080
Can I get your take on, on the Trump's hair?

01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:00.240
Cause I was researching today, I know it's a hack topic, but honestly, the more I read

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:05.680
about it, the more I'm confused, like that there's actually no consensus about what is

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:06.680
going on.

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:12.920
My theory is that he has some strands in the back, maybe that he kind of like swirls, swirls

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:13.920
around.

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:14.920
Yeah.

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:20.840
It's not, you might have, he might have a wig, but, um, at this point, at this point

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:25.320
probably it started as a swirl, now it's maybe a wig that looks just like it.

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.520
Huh.

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:27.920
That's an interesting, okay.

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:30.560
That's similar to the double combover theory, right?

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.560
Yeah.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.880
I mean, I always thought, I always thought it was like accepted theory that I was always

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:39.200
kind of boggled by that it was, it was a double combover, which that, that, that it was,

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.600
that it's from the side, like a traditional one.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:45.840
And then I guess from the back, like he has like, like riff-raff from, so it's like two

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.880
weather forces coming together.

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.560
And that's why it looks kind of like a basket.

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:55.080
Like if you look closely, like, like, but, but it, but it all flies up as one if the

01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:59.400
wind touches it and, um, but he's not bald underneath that.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:02.640
I don't, I, I, that as far as I can tell, um, I don't know.

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.600
I was researching it today because now I really want to know because of course he's our next

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:13.680
commander in chief and, uh, uh, watch out Ireland cause I love, I love the idea that

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.760
people in Ireland are like, I don't know if you've heard that my, my wife's in Ireland

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:20.880
and they're like the, the people that she's talking to, the big thing that they keep coming

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:29.160
back to is like, is I can't do an Irish accent, but and then, and then he tried, uh, is, is,

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:30.680
is Donald Trump going to win?

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:34.600
Like they're really, they really, cause they're, I guess that, that, that, that, that, that,

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:38.920
I guess there's, I guess we feel like those days are now have been here and have gone

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:43.000
that idea that the world is worried that a maniac will be president of America.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.800
I was like, I was like, what, have they been paying attention for 38 years?

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:50.000
Like, like, like what are they, what's their worst case scenario?

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.400
You know, do they really think there's still a button that works that's going to nuke Ireland?

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:58.840
Like, like, like, I guess maybe some more realistic fear having to do with what the,

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:01.400
our ability to collapse the entire world's economy.

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:05.920
When they're done, like, like, like who, I don't want Donald Trump to be president,

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:09.840
but who gives a fuck like, like, like, like, like, like what would be the big difference

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:15.640
between that and a fire hydrant behind that, that desk outside of Supreme court appointments,

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:19.040
which Jeff's, Jeff's, Jeff's point is very well taken, that this, this next election

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.840
is kind of important when a bipartisan sense that the Supreme court justices are going

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:28.840
to get picked buzzkill because now when your friends, you know, when you're, you, you want

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:32.000
to vote for Bernie Sanders right now and now over the next year, your friends are going

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.200
to slowly one by one, they're going to turn and they're going to start, they're going

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.640
to start ralph nadering you.

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:40.400
You don't know what that means because you're 25.

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.400
It hurts.

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:44.960
I have bad memories.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.600
Ross Perot, 92.

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:53.760
Your friends are going to change from third party advocates to fascist fucking bipartisan

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.800
little robots because they're going to go, you're splitting them up.

01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:01.640
You're voting for him, you're voting for the, you're voting, you might as well vote.

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:05.920
And this isn't a female character, this is a male.

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:06.920
I'm not sexist.

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:11.360
And that was, and that was a difference in the election, right?

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.160
It sounded a little bit like Tay Brickston.

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:20.400
Wait, we don't have time to explain that.

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:26.520
All right, well, we usually give our guests two choices.

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:33.680
You can either have a double gulp or, no, you can, you can, why do I give them a choice

01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:35.920
because that puts them on the spot?

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:36.920
That's too late.

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:41.880
You can, you can, you can stay and we're going to play a role playing game called shadow

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:45.680
run where you, where you, you play a character, you don't have to know anything about it.

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.400
You're just going to be a guy in the far future.

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.040
It's like a cyberpunk kind of world.

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:56.560
We usually get about two feet of movement accomplished and it's all, all what it really

01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:01.160
amounts to is a half hour of your time, not, not anything other than that.

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.600
Or you can leave and we can plug whatever you want to plug and you can, you can, no,

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.600
no, hang on.

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:06.600
Yeah.

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.600
Yeah.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:08.600
Let's bring out a Jamorge Brown.

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:09.600
Let's bring out Jamorge.

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:10.600
Jamorge.

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:29.520
I don't know if I'm reading this accurately, but I feel like there was audible reaction

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:33.720
to DeMorge's sexy shirt.

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:48.400
Bachelorette number one, that shirt is fucking legit man, that is, every once in a while

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:53.440
I go shopping and I go, that piece of whatever that is, I couldn't pull that off, but you

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.040
look great and that's a good, it's a good thing for you.

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:58.040
This will only make four people laugh that are not even in the audience.

01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:59.760
They're watching on their laptops.

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:07.320
When you pick that shirt in Borderlands 2, the video game, it's called Clever Girl.

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:10.320
That's the title of the shirt.

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:15.760
There's different armors in the game and they all have themes and it looks like a Jurassic

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:16.760
camouflage.

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:17.760
No, no, no, no.

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:25.760
Clever Girl would be, oh, so that wasn't a real Borderlands 2 skin.

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:32.080
That was just, you're using Borderlands 2 as a springboard to make a Jurassic Park clothing

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:33.080
joke?

01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:34.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:39.520
See, again, it's like the Philharmonic thing from earlier, I'm still bothered by that.

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:40.520
You know what, guess what?

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:45.720
I'm not a professional entertainer, he got my part of my ABC sitcom.

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:50.200
I'm not a fucking entertainer, I told you, I saw him, I was like, oh great, I'm fucked.

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.760
Guys, guys, guys, please, it's just a shirt.

01:30:52.760 --> 01:31:01.440
And I'm happy Boat Trip made you sad, because you know what, you made me sad.

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:04.440
You took my acting away.

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.440
That's why I'm here.

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:12.760
That's why you choked on your power.

01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:20.120
I hate our audience sometimes because they're so nice and then they ruin jokes sometimes

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:26.320
by doing that aw, and it makes me, you know, yeah, yeah, how weird that you can conjure

01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:28.920
it artificially.

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:34.680
It's almost as if it means nothing when it happens every fucking time.

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:43.080
Yeah, the aw is hard to come back from, the aw, and you can still kind of, you can still

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:50.240
get out.

01:31:50.240 --> 01:32:00.560
I'm not being condescending, everyone in the audience is a genius, the audiences can be

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:07.320
just delightfully stupid because they're acting as one, that's what you want them to do.

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:17.960
See, that guy's a genius, if they all went, yup, that would be weird.

01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:25.320
If you react by apologizing, which is what I always do, or like backpedaling or arguing,

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:26.760
they smell blood, right?

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:27.760
Isn't that the idea?

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:30.040
You're not supposed to show fear.

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:36.200
If you go like, hey, there's a spaghetti, and then the N word, and then they go, whoa.

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:38.480
And then you're just supposed to go, what are you supposed to do?

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:43.480
Like Greg's group goes, walk it off, fuck faces, and then he just keeps moving.

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:48.280
We were in Yakima, Washington, and have I told the story before?

01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:50.280
Well maybe to me.

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:54.000
We were doing an improv show with like, you know, the Who's Aligned guys, me and Ryan

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Stiles and Chip Esson probably.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.400
And we were in Yakima, and Greg's coming out there, does the intro, and he's explaining

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.480
how improv works for people that don't know, and he's like, we're going to come to you

01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:06.120
for our suggestions, so if I ask you for a name of a writer, you sir, you might say this,

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:09.800
and if I ask you for a name of a thing, Matt of me might say that, and he said, and if

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:14.400
you sir, if I was, give me an activity that you would do around the crib, and the guy

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:18.720
just kind of looks stare blank and goes, oh, I'm sorry, I forget where we are, sir, let's

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:23.640
say slang term for your domicile, like where you live, name an activity that you would

01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:30.440
do around the trailer, and the crowd goes, oh, and Greg just goes, walk it off, Yakima.

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:36.520
Yeah, I don't know, it's Yakima.

01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.360
I'm not the walk it off Yakima kind of guy.

01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:41.440
No, you know, Greg can get away with paddling the audience, and they kind of like it, but

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:42.440
you have to.

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:47.520
I like to think, I like to think, I really like to think, and don't we all like to think

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:49.440
a bunch of dumb shit, that's not true.

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:53.920
I like to think that the audience is endeared by my tendency to then go, well, wait, wait,

01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:59.040
well, I didn't mean it that way, you know, and try, because I didn't, but then I'm also

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:03.120
mad at them sometimes for going on, because they didn't even mean that.

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:07.800
It's weird how we do have a tendency to like, I noticed one time, here's a weird thing,

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:13.280
there's a legal term, silence is consent, but the word consent has taken on this whole,

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:18.400
you know, really, really powerful sizzling meaning of a really specific content.

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:23.400
But I remember two times in this podcast before I ever figured that out, I used the term silence

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:29.880
is consent, which was just more of a reference to this like legal, like I was saying, meaning

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:33.720
in the larger legal sense, that if you don't do, or philosophical sense, if you don't do

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:38.920
something about something, then it's your, you're not, you don't get a pass necessarily.

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:42.240
But I think it's because of the word consent, because both times if you go back through

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:47.480
the archives, like I go, silence is consent, and I hear people go like, like an audible

01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:53.360
response from the crowd, as one, go like, oh, I was like, no, that's not, that's not

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:57.080
that, you, the word, because it's because of the word consent became part of a different

01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:59.600
family of language recently.

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.720
Well, yeah, you're saying that, that date rape's okay as long as you don't talk.

01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:08.360
As long as no one talks, it's all good.

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:17.360
Yeah, yeah, the phrase silence is consent applied to like our current conversations about consent,

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:23.720
not a great, not a great idea, like, like, but it's an, it's old, it's like platonic

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:28.200
or something, it's like, it's, it's a, it's a concept.

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:34.200
I think we got to the bottom of that.

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:36.120
And then also, you know what I don't like?

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.120
There's silence.

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:40.680
Why not, why aren't they always laughing?

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.600
Or applauding, or saying, I love you.

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:45.800
You just spent the last 15 minutes taking a big shit on them.

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:49.520
Why do they, why do they always have to either be quiet or reacting the way I don't want

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.520
them to?

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:55.760
Why can't they just react the way I want them to react?

01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:59.560
My name is Slam Charisma.

01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:06.720
See, I, I, I kind of feel bad because the stupidest thing is like Barton made that terrific

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:07.720
noise earlier on.

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:12.320
So, Harish, are you aware of Barton's awesome, magical laugh?

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:13.320
No, no.

01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:14.320
Oh boy.

01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.320
Can you manufacture it?

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:19.320
Can I, can I cue you and can you kind of do a fake version of it?

01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:23.320
Tell me a garbanzo bean joke, Dan.

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:25.200
Okay, okay.

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:28.320
What's the difference between a garbanzo bean and a chickpea?

01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:42.400
He doesn't even, he can't even wait for the punch line.

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:52.520
Looks like Glenda the Goodwitch walking in on you while you're taking a shit.

01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:58.760
You're like, you're like the world's happiest ghost.

01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:02.280
I've never heard him laugh.

01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:03.280
You work with Barton, right?

01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:04.280
No, I don't.

01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:05.280
Oh.

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:07.400
I, I didn't, I've never heard him laugh.

01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.880
Oh, you called in.

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:10.880
Okay.

01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:12.880
Well, thank you.

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:22.560
Oh, I thought you, I thought you guys were, I was just, what's the difference?

01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:27.360
I thought, I thought they were being, I thought they were being way gratuitously like labor

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:32.520
law, like, like, because he was like, I called, I called in and you're like, oh, you called

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.520
in and you're like, what's the difference, Harishio?

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:45.440
And I was like, you're sorry, I guess, I guess, you know, he called but he was a guest

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:46.440
and I didn't say anything about it.

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:47.440
Sorry.

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:51.120
I'm just a fucking animal because I have on a phone.

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:52.520
The opposite should be true.

01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:56.440
You can have an animal on your show that Johnny Carson ever have a chimp call in.

01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:02.920
I can't name the times he had one right on on a tricycle.

01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:09.080
Guest is a pirate for some reason, I guess, because Dan, what's the difference between

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:11.520
a garbanzo bean and a chickpea?

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.920
The difference between a garbanzo bean and a chickpea.

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:15.600
You can't just say that.

01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:18.920
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, just fucking stop it because you're part of the problem.

01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:21.400
We were in New York.

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:25.240
I told this joke on this, do we talk about this last time when we were shooting this

01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:32.320
little pilot that Dan and Dina were doing, we, we were kind of like kind of just joking

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:37.000
with the audience, kind of keeping warm between the stuff and I went out and told this garbanzo

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:43.120
bean joke and I got this big laugh and then Dino was just drunk, drunk, comes like stinking

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:47.000
drunk, comes running up like in front of the cameras with a script in his hand.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.520
No, no, no, no, no, no, you fucked up, you told it wrong, you told it wrong and he tells

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:55.840
me the joke completely wrong in my ear and the whole audience just got it and totally

01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:00.280
loved it and then the next day we were laughing about that, we sat at a bar and I said, Dan,

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:06.000
try to tell the joke and I'm, I, it, it, how long, 15, 20 minutes it took?

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.800
Yeah, well, so now should we tell them what the joke is and then just explain?

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:12.200
Tell them the joke and then I'll tell them how you started your version.

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:16.560
Okay, so should I be the one to try to tell them the garbanzo bean joke?

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:17.560
Right now?

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:18.560
I think I can do it.

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.560
Do it.

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:20.560
Okay.

01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:21.560
Two lines.

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.560
Take it from the top.

01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:23.560
Martin, get ready, get ready with your mouth.

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:26.200
Do you understand that you've never done this under this kind of pressure?

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:27.200
Yeah.

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:30.320
The bad at telling jokes is the, is the big joke.

01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:31.320
Me too.

01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:32.320
Oh.

01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:40.960
Whoa, whoa, you can't, you just talk shit about Oz if you fucking awe him.

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:43.480
That was, that was a very different kind of Oz.

01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:44.480
How do we know?

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.480
How do we, what's the difference?

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:56.800
That was a, now we're just, all right, now we're just, all right, all right, all right.

01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:01.560
What's the difference between a garbanzo bean and a chickpea?

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:13.920
I don't pay $200 to have a garbanzo bean in my mouth.

01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:19.440
Outta boy.

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:22.320
Time flies like a soup, but banana flies like an arrow.

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.600
Okay, so.

01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:26.960
Fruit flies like an arrow, but fruit flies like a banana.

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:30.200
Yeah, I'm sure all these jokes have their little codes.

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:34.920
It's, it's called the order of the words to make them funny.

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:35.920
Okay.

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:39.520
So Dan, so we're doing it and we're like, Dan, try to tell the joke and we're at this

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:43.520
bar in the afternoon, getting, they're getting ready to leave town and Dan goes, okay, okay,

01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:44.520
okay, okay, I'm gonna get it.

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:45.520
I'm gonna get it.

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:46.520
All right, so, all right.

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:52.360
Look as we're, again, to emphasize the irony is that we're mocking Dino because Dino got

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:53.360
the joke wrong.

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:58.560
He comes up in my ear and he goes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it has to be a girl garbanzo

01:40:58.560 --> 01:40:59.560
bean.

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:00.560
Yeah.

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:01.560
I'm like.

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:02.560
That's, it's crazy.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.200
Like, so that's, that's what we're laughing about.

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:05.200
He's a little fun fact.

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.120
He told me this joke.

01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:12.040
So we're, so we're, so we're, so we're, so even though he heard the laugh, he heard the

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:13.040
joke where he came out.

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.040
So we're mocking Dino for making that decision.

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:16.200
We're like, what are you doing with it?

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:20.560
And then Jeff passed his, I love watching Dan try to tell a joke.

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:21.560
And so he goes, okay.

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:26.400
So a guy walks in to a prostitutes office.

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:28.360
And I really thought that's the thing.

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:32.440
A prostitutes office.

01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.440
I forgot that there was such a thing as this.

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:41.280
And he said, I would like a sexual encounter with, with, with a lagoon or, what kind of

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:43.800
beans do you have, guys?

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:45.480
I know that there's two beans.

01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.480
Okay.

01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:48.480
So we're like prostitutes office.

01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:49.480
I guess, okay.

01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:53.440
The office isn't important, the guy, the guy, there's a guy, there's a guy, he's in a desert

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:59.040
and there's another, and he walks up to another guy and the guy says, I have two kinds of

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:00.040
beans.

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:02.640
I got, Dan, this is a two line joke.

01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:05.560
You're like, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:09.080
And so you tried for ever and ever and ever and ever to try to, okay, how can you be a

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:10.080
two line joke?

01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:11.080
How can it be a two line joke?

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:12.680
And the answer is because you're the guy.

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:14.520
I forgot that that's possible in a joke.

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:15.800
You could just be the guy.

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:16.800
You could just.

01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:21.240
So he, so he finally gives up and he's like, okay, how does the guy go, what's the difference

01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:22.240
that you fucking died?

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.240
I was like, oh my God.

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:24.240
It's a riddle.

01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:25.240
Yeah.

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:26.240
It's a riddle.

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:29.080
What have I got in my pockets?

01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:33.960
Which by the way, I'm sure we all agree Bilbo's being kind of a asshole, right?

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:35.440
In that riddle competition.

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:38.760
Yeah, it's definitely cheated.

01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:39.760
What have I got in my pocket?

01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:40.760
It's not a riddle.

01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:47.480
And that, you know, on another episode and please tell your friends to come for when

01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:48.480
we talk about it.

01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:52.640
I'd really like to talk about, you know, what, what, what goes into when does Sauron decide

01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:54.200
that a ring gets to get lost?

01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:55.200
It's fucking dumb.

01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:56.200
Oh yeah.

01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:01.680
Just, just decide that the ring can roll down a hill and take over the world then.

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:06.040
I don't like the magic in the Tolkien universe.

01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.040
Yeah.

01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:10.720
We don't like the magic in the Tolkien universe.

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:14.880
We think it's too spiritual and not rule driven enough.

01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:15.880
Plot magic.

01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:16.880
It's bullshit.

01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:17.880
You know what's exciting?

01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:18.880
Jackie Chan beating someone up.

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:19.880
You know why?

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:22.720
Because you can see what the rules of a shopping cart are and why it's weird to use it as

01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:23.720
a weapon.

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:30.600
If two old guys are fighting with spells, it's like I want to know what their mana levels

01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:31.600
are depleted.

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.600
You know?

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.080
And what's the rules?

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:35.080
You know?

01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:36.080
Like, like, knock, knock.

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:37.080
Who's there?

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.240
And then it's like, weren't you glad I didn't say banana?

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.600
And you're like, that's clever.

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:45.360
He did magic better than the other guy, or he knows more spells, or he had a secret

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:50.680
spell button in his pocket, or, just give me the, give me the, give me the shit that

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:51.680
I came for.

01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:52.680
Tolkien?

01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:58.160
You'll never defeat me, Sauriman, for I have a magical spell button in my pocket.

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.000
It's a nice.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.720
I think it's funny.

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:11.360
Now, a single person in this room has reacted to me the right way tonight.

01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.360
Except for Barton.

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:25.840
And I, and I, I just, I just turn into, I don't know, Charlie Rose, what would I, what

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:28.400
would I turn into if you melted my evil away?

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:29.400
John Stuart?

01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:35.000
Just a, just a beautiful little baby.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:45.440
I am a, I'm a, I'm a big ugly baby.

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:50.720
I think there would be a, a handsome efficient skeleton underneath me, if, if all of my bad

01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:55.040
qualities melted away, there'd be a little tiny, like one of those day of the dead, uh,

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.920
Mexican skeletons, like, uh, Fandango.

01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:02.720
I think if you stripped away all the stuff of the exterior, what we've come to recognize

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:05.920
is just, you're excited that you'd just be made of all quartos.

01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:09.400
You'd just be a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of little mini-quattos or whatever.

01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:10.400
All right.

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:18.520
Well, uh, I guess the title of tonight's show is bullying, uh, finding, yeah, well, you

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:22.280
know, there's that way, you can do it that way.

01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:24.240
I'm not stupid.

01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:30.480
I know the different kinds of punches from the, I'm not touching you, uh, all the way

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:34.960
to the, to the, oh poor baby, or all punches.

01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:35.960
The old soft boat.

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:40.480
I don't know if you guys have heard this term, microaggression.

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:47.960
That's you guys, constantly, you're a macroaggression of little microaggressions.

01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:54.600
Yeah, I hope, I hope you're expressing real pain.

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.720
I meant, I meant it to hurt.

01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:57.720
Bad people.

01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:58.720
All right.

01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:02.720
What do we, what do we, what do we, let's, let's, let's play some shadow, right?

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:03.720
Sorry.

01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:04.720
Horatio.

01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:11.440
By the way, if you do, if you do come and join the Feral Audio family, we'd love to

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:14.320
have you back or you don't have to, that's not conditional.

01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:19.920
You can come, you can come, you can come back regardless of business decisions.

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:20.920
Thank you.

01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:21.920
Here we go again.

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:26.480
We'd like to have you back and we'd like you to join the Feral Audio family and, and listen

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.480
to your podcast.

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:29.480
Horatio.

01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:33.480
All right.

01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.480
And DeMorge, you know, keep coming.

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:40.560
Oh, do we know, do, do we want to bring anybody else up?

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:41.560
Um, we could.

01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:44.520
You know, I think why, we want to get a gal to come up.

01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:45.520
How are we doing like head count wise?

01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:46.600
I mean, I can never remember.

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:48.720
I'm always, I'm always fine.

01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:51.080
I know you are, but sometimes that seems passive aggressive.

01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:53.440
Well, you know, I think that's your projection.

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:57.840
You know, that's just, uh, that's your, your dream or whatever.

01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:59.840
I think you're for agreements.

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.840
Callie, you want to come up?

01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:06.080
Can we, let's get Kali Kazoo, the woman who made the music that you've been hearing

01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:07.080
all night long.

01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:08.080
Oh.

01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:13.440
Kali Fontecchio.

01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:15.760
What's the name of the new record again, Callie?

01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:17.280
Contrary to popular belief.

01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:20.320
And where can these people listen to that and purchase it?

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:23.240
On my band cat camp.

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:24.240
Kali Kazoo.bandcamp.com.

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:25.240
All right.

01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:30.320
You, um, you kids are living in a world of more dots now.

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:31.800
That's the big thing.

01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:33.920
You guys got more dots now.

01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:34.920
Yeah.

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:38.520
Also, the, I don't know if we ever really set the record straight cause I think we were

01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:43.600
talking about the, the Mickey Mouse hands and I think we kind of made you sound racist

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:45.080
for me when we talked about that.

01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:49.480
You misquoted me or you, I mean, you kind of said it, but then you, you, you backstep.

01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:52.440
I just, I just made a, you guys were talking about cartoon gloves.

01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:54.360
I'm an animator, by the way.

01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:55.360
Yay.

01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:04.880
So I told Jeff when we were at the renaissance fair of all places that, uh, you know, I

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:09.280
cartoon gloves kind of have a history of being based off of what was one of the most popular

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:22.440
forms of comedy long ago, which was minstrel, minstrel, minstrel shows, so like Mickey

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:29.920
Mouse, Mickey Mouse and lots of other characters had white cartoon gloves, which also served

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:30.920
the purposes.

01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:32.640
It's in black and white and it's a contrast thing.

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:36.800
I mean, sometimes they didn't have gloves, but like, yeah, it's a, it's a minstrel show

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:37.800
thing.

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:38.800
Really?

01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:39.800
Yeah.

01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:40.800
And, and, and minstrel shows, they had it.

01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:44.800
So cause you know, people from far away could see what they were, you know, doing.

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:45.800
But yeah.

01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:47.520
And also there'd be stakes.

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:50.000
Jesus, there's a black guy in here.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:54.320
I mean, if you watch the early Mickey Mouse cartoons, they're, I mean, they're kind of

01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:55.320
inferring.

01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:58.080
He's a, a certain.

01:48:58.080 --> 01:48:59.080
He's black.

01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:00.080
Wait, really?

01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:01.080
They're implying Mickey Mouse is black?

01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:02.080
Yeah.

01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:06.600
I mean, it's, it's, they're sort of imply some kind of like racist things.

01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:11.280
Like he's like, you know, getting drunk or doing whatever kind of crazy things.

01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:12.280
They're kind of inferring.

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:13.280
Huh.

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.280
Goofy's black.

01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:15.280
Yeah.

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:16.280
And goofy.

01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:17.280
Goofy's black?

01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:21.200
Or a dippy dog, which is his original name.

01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:22.200
Yeah.

01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:23.920
I mean, there was a lot of that in cartoons.

01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:25.640
I mean, there was just a lot of that in comics.

01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:26.640
Active trickster figures.

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:31.360
And there was this idea that you could, when you wanted them to not play to that effect,

01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.080
you could do certain things to make them not play to that effect or surround them in situations

01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:36.080
so they didn't.

01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:41.080
But then they did a lot of also like sort of, you can't get mad at a cartoon and everybody

01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:42.080
else would just go crazy.

01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:45.080
And so they would throw the book at them and let them do a whole bunch of crazy shit.

01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:49.640
But yeah, no, I mean, it was a different, it was a different time then.

01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:57.120
If you guys are, if you guys want to see some real racist shit, check out the 11 band cartoons.

01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:58.120
That shit's crazy.

01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:00.000
Like Cole Black and DeSubbin Dwarves.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Oh yeah.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.760
I went down a rabbit hole and watched a bunch of old little rascals and some of those are

01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:07.760
shocking.

01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:08.760
They went absolutely insane.

01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:11.880
Have you seen the one where they put on a play and it's Uncle Tom's Cabin, including

01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:12.880
the whipping scene?

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:13.880
Oh yeah.

01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:14.880
Yeah.

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:15.880
We watched that.

01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:16.880
That was crazy.

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:17.880
Rob's place.

01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:18.880
Did we?

01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:19.880
Yeah.

01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:20.880
Yeah.

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:21.880
Medina.

01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:22.880
Yeah.

01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:23.880
Right.

01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:24.880
Wow.

01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:25.880
Okay.

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:26.880
So speaking of progress.

01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:34.320
Because the show isn't sexist, we let the lady choose which characters she wants to play,

01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:39.920
even though they're not both female characters, nailed it.

01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:49.560
It's a combination of chivalry and total fucking like post-feminist ladies first.

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.800
Do you want to play a dude or a girl?

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:53.200
I'll be Aaron's character.

01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:54.200
Okay.

01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:56.200
I mean, I like what Aaron started.

01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:59.480
This is going to be a great 10 minutes there.

01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:02.880
You're the character created by Kumail Nanjiani.

01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:03.880
Is that Dr. Friend?

01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:05.040
I can't even keep track of.

01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:06.040
Yeah.

01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:07.040
Okay.

01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:10.600
This is like Dungeons and Dragons for a show, except in the future.

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:15.320
And so you're a troll doctor who's going to let a troubled past.

01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:18.880
If that doesn't make sense to you, those papers, don't worry about it.

01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:19.880
Yeah.

01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:21.480
Doesn't make sense to anybody else.

01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:22.480
All right.

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.480
Time's wasting.

01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:24.480
So let's start this off.

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:29.960
We're going to go back to the old days of the D&D spend.

01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:32.920
So there's a recap at the beginning, and maybe your training will let you listen better

01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:34.240
than I do.

01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:39.960
This one was by Richard Clark, previously on Harmontown Shadow Run Time.

01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:44.400
Our heroes found themselves placed in the precarious position of dealing with a mysterious

01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.480
brief beeping briefcase.

01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:51.360
The noble Dr. Friend enveloped the potential threat with a force field only to find the

01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:54.440
group fleeing before his very eyes.

01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:59.760
Following the case, Horde Guard detected a horde of glowing creatures, the Damajoras

01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:03.000
of the infected souls who lurk in the shadows.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:08.240
As Jim Nightblade sought refuge on a roof of a nearby building, the brave runners armed

01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:10.680
themselves and charged into battle.

01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:15.160
After cracking wise, Jim Nightblade returned to the beeping case and opened it, only to

01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:19.720
find a transponder that sends the infected horde into a rage.

01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:21.640
Will our heroes survive the night?

01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:26.320
Will a serial number on the device lead our protagonists on a ghoulish side quest?

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:27.320
Probably not.

01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:30.400
Will Horde Guard make another poopy mid-battle?

01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:35.080
Find out on this week's Harmontown Shadow Run Time.

01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:37.920
Thank you, Spencer.

01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:38.920
Thank you.

01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:39.920
All right.

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:40.920
Are all the...

01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:41.920
I never listened.

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:42.920
Richard Clark.

01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:43.920
Richard Clark.

01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:44.920
Fake name.

01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:47.000
Thanks, Richard.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.200
Did we kill all the trolls?

01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:50.200
Ghouls.

01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:51.200
Ghouls.

01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:52.200
No.

01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:53.200
You killed about four of them.

01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:54.200
Most of them ran away.

01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:55.200
Right.

01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:57.880
So how many we got left?

01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:58.880
You know.

01:52:58.880 --> 01:52:59.880
None.

01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:02.840
I mean, there's none in your immediate area other than the one you just stunned.

01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:10.280
You guys were more recently occupied with casting a group agony spell on a car.

01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:11.280
Oh, that's right.

01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:14.600
Yeah, I forgot about that.

01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:16.440
So Richard, Richard kind of...

01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:17.440
Oh, yeah.

01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:21.360
No, I mean, nothing happened that episode, so I used the last one.

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.360
Oh.

01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:23.360
Yeah.

01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:24.360
All right.

01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:25.680
And then they'd cast agony on a car.

01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:26.680
Okay.

01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:27.680
All right.

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:28.680
Shadow Run.

01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:29.680
We got to find that Johnson to screw this over.

01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:32.040
He gave us a troll magnet and a briefcase, a ghoul magnet.

01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:33.040
Ghoul.

01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:37.560
So we all joined hands and we tried to combine our energy, and I did come out of the closet

01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:38.560
in my character.

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:39.560
The...

01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:44.720
Yeah, we were trying to cast an agony spell on whoever.

01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:45.720
So...

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:46.720
Which...

01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:47.720
Which spell would that work?

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:53.680
I mean, what happened is you all cast the spell on a car that's several miles away.

01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:58.560
So if anything was going to happen, happened, or will happen, there's no way of knowing.

01:53:58.560 --> 01:53:59.560
All right.

01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:00.560
Can't I...

01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:02.880
Can't I astrally project and see if that worked?

01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:05.720
Yeah, but you'd have to find the car and you don't know where it is.

01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:10.760
Okay, I summon a sparrow.

01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:11.760
You're too weak.

01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:15.240
You just summoned a larger air spirit to do the...

01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:17.000
Sit down, cross-legged.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.000
All right.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:28.120
I would suggest to Dr. Friend that perhaps he applies some sort of healing to our weakened

01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:29.600
run mate.

01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:30.600
Dr. Friend, can you...

01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:34.600
Can you try to boost up my mana power level?

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:38.760
Yeah, man.

01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:40.760
I'm a woman.

01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:41.760
What's that?

01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:42.760
I'm a woman.

01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:43.760
I know, I'm blind.

01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:47.920
I just say, man, about everybody, you know?

01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:48.920
All right, that's cool.

01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:54.320
I call my mom like, hey, man, can you make us some stew?

01:54:54.320 --> 01:55:00.040
Technically, she's a girl and very sensitive, so...

01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:01.960
So what do I do?

01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:06.160
Look through your spells in there and see if you've got something that can heal me.

01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:07.160
He's got heal.

01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:09.840
Oh, yeah, heal.

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:11.440
So I just say, yeah, let's do it.

01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:12.440
Okay.

01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:14.040
Do your magic.

01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:17.520
Cast that spell, doctor.

01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:19.720
Best used after first aid is applied.

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:20.720
That's true.

01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:26.120
Yeah, but they always say that, like, you're supposed to clean your ear out before you

01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:27.120
put drops in.

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:28.120
That's true.

01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:29.800
It's like, give me a break.

01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:31.720
Just fix my ear, doc.

01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:39.520
Sorry, I'm just doing some stand-up.

01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:40.600
So I need to heal you.

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:41.600
What's wrong with you?

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:45.200
I just have low energy from casting too many spells of my own, and I'm kind of drained.

01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:46.960
Okay, so this should probably rhyme?

01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:50.280
Yeah, yeah, I think all good spells should rhyme.

01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.600
Tell me one more time what the problem is.

01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:56.880
I've drained my energy, my spiritual energy.

01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:59.280
I'm going to rhyme it with drain.

01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:00.280
Okay.

01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:05.840
He's kind of like the peniteller of Spokastic.

01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:08.960
He lets you in on the process.

01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:16.760
I sub in the spirits to clean the spells you have drained.

01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:19.320
I cast the spirits.

01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:24.240
So wonderful to give you a power back that you'll feel rebrained.

01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:25.240
Nice.

01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:26.240
Heel.

01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:27.240
Those are the spirits.

01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:28.240
They're the spirits.

01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:29.240
Heel.

01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:30.240
It sounds like booing.

01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:31.240
Those are spirits.

01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:40.520
Did it work, Spencer?

01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:46.560
Laying hands on Eve Libertine, magical energy surges forth, re-knitting your wounds and

01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:47.560
refreshing your mind.

01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:49.560
Because you know you're the Hayaku!

01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:54.560
I feel great.

01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:57.720
I cast the sparrow to go find the car.

01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:03.000
I summon a spirit animal with my spirit charm focus.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.400
How strong?

01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:05.600
Level five, Jackson.

01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:06.600
Gee.

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:12.840
You're like one of these drunk people on St. Elsewhere that gets a new liver and then

01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:13.840
they go to the bar.

01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:16.120
I don't know what to say, one of.

01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:18.120
That was a story on St. Elsewhere.

01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:21.280
Hey, that's the life of a magician.

01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:25.480
If I die in the process of doing what I do, that's just the life I've chosen.

01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:29.880
I'd like to say one thing if I could to the group, okay?

01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:35.240
Just because I feel like a lot of what we did tonight, or this whole, I guess to us

01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:39.720
it's been tonight, but this has been going on for a while and I feel like we're bad

01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:45.280
shadow runners and we've had a bad shadow run.

01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:53.600
I've made a lot of bad decisions and we've got to chalk this one up as a failure, right?

01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:55.920
They got away, they gave us a cool magnet instead of money.

01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:56.920
We didn't get any money.

01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:57.920
Right.

01:57:57.920 --> 01:57:58.920
It's not over till it's over.

01:57:58.920 --> 01:57:59.920
Yeah.

01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:00.920
My bird could still.

01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:06.480
Half of the characters that we were supposed to either kidnap or protect are dead.

01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:10.800
We just kept giving them to the bad guys and they kept killing them.

01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:15.360
There's no lens through which we could be viewed as even anti-heroes because even anti-heroes

01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:16.360
are part hero.

01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:18.880
We're like anti-neighbors maybe.

01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:22.960
Are you suggesting that we just drop this as it lies?

01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:23.960
You know what?

01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:24.960
This is the great thing about being a shadow runner.

01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:29.760
Do you think Banksy, like, dwells on, was like, oh, I spray painted that rat wrong.

01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:32.200
I should stop being Banksy.

01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:35.560
He gets up and he tries again, you know?

01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:40.240
Like we just move on and we hope that this doesn't show up on our LinkedIn.

01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:42.880
So you just want to start from scratch?

01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.840
New Johnson, new shadow run?

01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:46.240
Well, we have to.

01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:48.520
These people are going to pay us for anything else, aren't they?

01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:50.040
Should we not look for this car?

01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:51.920
Because I have a photographic memory, apparently.

01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:52.920
Oh yeah?

01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:53.920
Yeah.

01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:54.920
I don't know.

01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:56.520
I don't know what happened before this.

01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:57.520
Ah, shit.

01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:58.520
Well, maybe I'm doing it wrong again.

01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:02.000
We did a job and the guy was supposed to pay us and instead of money in the briefcase,

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.880
it was a transponder that brought a bunch of ghouls to kill us.

01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:07.840
So he just completely hosed us and tried to whack us.

01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:11.880
And I'm saying, there's no harm in me sending up my bird to see what we see.

01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:17.040
But we can, if you want to start looking for a clean sleigh, I'm with that too.

01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:19.160
But there's also the possibility of revenge.

01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:20.160
Oh yeah.

01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:22.640
I don't think we've seen the last of that asshole.

01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:23.640
I mean.

01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:24.640
No, he means us taking revenge.

01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:27.480
I mean, we could just go on a killing spree at this point.

01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:28.480
Who cares?

01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:30.600
Well, because that doesn't pay anything.

01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:31.600
That's my point.

01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:36.280
We're supposed to be at worst mercenaries and at best, maybe a dark version of a hero

01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:38.520
in an unlikely context.

01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:44.680
What we have done in this Shadowrun is like, it's like we're some strange drunk animal

01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:49.520
that just, and we've hurt people and ourselves and we've made less money than we could have

01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:54.880
made and we've cost everyone their lives and we're standing here in the street, exhausted,

01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:57.680
almost dead with a ghoul magnet.

01:59:57.680 --> 01:59:59.680
You gotta let the ghoul magnet thing go, man.

01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:00.840
Well, no, it burns.

02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:03.960
It fucking hurts, man, because the whole time I was thinking, just get that suitcase full

02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:05.600
of money and it's a fucking ghoul magnet.

02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:07.200
Like I feel, it's my fault.

02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:08.200
I feel like a piece of shit.

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:10.000
I feel like a bad Shadowrunner.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.120
But you have to be able to do as she said, let these things go.

02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:18.720
If you want to cut bait, then emotionally, you must cut bait as well.

02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:25.920
This is, of course, a world of shadows and running and chaos and the boundaries are imaginary

02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:31.440
or also constructed and you, again, you must do two things at once and do nothing at the

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:32.440
same time.

02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:37.320
It's all about just sort of attacking and then not carrying too much water with you.

02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:41.040
Let's go forward if you're going to go forward, otherwise we turn tail.

02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:44.640
We find this guy using what tools we have necessary.

02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:49.040
Find him and blast his fucking head off.

02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:55.160
And the currency, the currency, the currency I might suggest is the satisfaction of revenge.

02:00:55.160 --> 02:01:01.480
Blood is tasty when drunk and quenches thirst for years and years and then you go forward

02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:03.480
and then you make money.

02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:04.480
If possible.

02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:10.120
Okay, but Cordegard, can I trust you to remind me why we're getting revenge?

02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:13.200
Because it seems like almost we're the only ones that did anything wrong.

02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:18.120
Okay, but what I'm saying is if you're okay, well, first of all, a deal is a deal unless

02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:19.680
a deal has not happened.

02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:20.680
Right, we want our money.

02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:21.680
We want our money.

02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:22.680
We want our fucking money.

02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:23.680
We want our fucking money.

02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:24.680
Here's what I say.

02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:25.680
You know what?

02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:26.680
I'm pissed about this.

02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:27.680
I'm going to send my little bird out.

02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:28.680
We find him.

02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:30.600
I'm going to ask for the project, track that dude down.

02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:36.640
I'm going to summon the biggest orca in the world and just smash the whole fucking car.

02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:45.440
Which is like the speech, no, the mainstay speech of the old, old, old, old high women

02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:50.080
or also adamant, which is your money or your life, you know?

02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:51.080
That's it.

02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:52.080
It's very simple.

02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:53.080
I mean, Cordegard's got a point.

02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:54.080
I'm with Cordegard.

02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:56.280
If you have a photographic memory for Christ's sake, use it in three dimensions.

02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:57.280
Spin the car around.

02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:58.280
Find a license plate.

02:01:58.280 --> 02:01:59.280
Is that something we can roll in?

02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:00.280
Find a license plate.

02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:01.280
My photographic memory?

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:02.280
I mean, you have it.

02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:04.720
I'd like to talk to the other gay shadow runner, Dr. Friend.

02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:05.720
Okay.

02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:06.720
Thank you.

02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:15.880
I just want to tell everyone that if your parents have had a trans-vaginal mesh situation,

02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:23.000
if there are attorneys now that you can contact, and several attorneys now that specialize in

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.680
trans-vaginal mesh detachments.

02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:28.680
What is that?

02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:29.680
What is that?

02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:30.680
What are you saying?

02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:31.680
What is that?

02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:36.680
Well, I guess it's something so that your organs don't fall out of your vagina, and

02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:39.680
apparently what they're making this mesh out of is what they're...

02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:41.440
Is that something I should be concerned about?

02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:43.680
Not yet, but at some point.

02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:44.680
Cliffhanger!

02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:47.680
The Cliffhanger is Callie's 40th birthday.

02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:48.680
I don't know what...

02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:49.680
45th.

02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:50.680
No.

02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:51.680
Let's thank Kali Kazoova coming up here.

02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:52.680
Go check out her new record.

02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:53.680
Okay.

02:02:53.680 --> 02:03:03.680
DeMorge Brown, Spencer Crittenden, Horatio Sands.

02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:04.680
Thank you.

02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:05.680
What a treat.

02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:06.680
Horatio, thank you so much.

02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:07.680
Go check out his show, the Horatio.

02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:08.680
Maybe one day he'll be on Ferris.

02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:09.680
I'm Jeff Davis.

02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:10.680
One more time for your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.

02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:11.680
Thank you.

02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:12.680
Thank you.

02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:13.680
Thank you.

02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:14.680
Thank you.

02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:15.680
Thank you.

02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:16.680
Thank you.

02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:17.680
Thank you.

02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:18.680
Thank you.

02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:19.680
Thank you.

02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:20.680
Thank you.

02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:27.680
Thank you, Mr. Dan Harmon.

02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:36.680
Did you get any of that?

02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:51.680
Go to the show.
