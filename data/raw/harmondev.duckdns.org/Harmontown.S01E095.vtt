{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:29.960\nHello, everybody, welcome to Meltdown Conference in Hollywood, California.\n\n00:29.960 --> 00:31.960\nWelcome to the Nerdmelt Theater.\n\n00:31.960 --> 00:44.960\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:44.960 --> 00:54.960\nWelcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:54.960 --> 00:56.960\nThank you.\n\n00:56.960 --> 00:58.960\nWelcome, welcome back.\n\n00:58.960 --> 01:00.960\nSo we're in Austin.\n\n01:00.960 --> 01:03.960\nI have a little, I have a little cold, nothing contagious.\n\n01:03.960 --> 01:09.960\nIt's just, you know, everyone that has a cold is an expert at that.\n\n01:09.960 --> 01:11.960\nDefinitely not going to get you sick.\n\n01:11.960 --> 01:17.960\nI'm just, if you're wondering why I sound a little more like Willie Nelson or David Duchovny.\n\n01:17.960 --> 01:19.960\nNow you know why.\n\n01:19.960 --> 01:20.960\nI'm looking at my phone.\n\n01:20.960 --> 01:22.960\nI'm looking at what the shit we got to get through.\n\n01:22.960 --> 01:24.960\nBecause we got all kinds of friends coming to talk to us.\n\n01:24.960 --> 01:29.960\nWe're going to do the Southwest South, Southwest South.\n\n01:29.960 --> 01:33.960\nThe South by Southwest breakdown with our friend, Kumail, who we didn't get to see out there.\n\n01:33.960 --> 01:40.960\nBut I want to bring him out as soon as possible and just kind of download with him about Austin.\n\n01:40.960 --> 01:42.960\nKumail's photo was everywhere.\n\n01:42.960 --> 01:43.960\nYeah.\n\n01:43.960 --> 01:46.960\nOn the back of the pedicabs, little bicycle, Rickshaw thingies.\n\n01:46.960 --> 01:50.960\nYou could not move a muscle without seeing Kumail's gorgeous little face everywhere.\n\n01:50.960 --> 01:51.960\nBecause he's in this HBO thing.\n\n01:51.960 --> 01:53.960\nThey're promoting the hell out of it down there.\n\n01:53.960 --> 01:54.960\nHoly smoke.\n\n01:54.960 --> 01:55.960\nIt was Orwellian.\n\n01:55.960 --> 01:56.960\nDid the community ever get there?\n\n01:56.960 --> 02:00.960\nAt the exact place where you're taking off your shoes and having your ass searched by the TSA.\n\n02:00.960 --> 02:02.960\nKumail, not Johnny's head.\n\n02:02.960 --> 02:04.960\nStaring over you in Austin.\n\n02:04.960 --> 02:07.960\nCasting a rye glance at you as you were.\n\n02:07.960 --> 02:13.960\nBut before we get there, we don't want to torture him by talking about that while he's in the wings.\n\n02:13.960 --> 02:18.960\nBut I just wanted to, you know, here's our pop culture minute.\n\n02:18.960 --> 02:26.960\nPop culture minute.\n\n02:26.960 --> 02:32.960\nWell, there's some things that everyone is talking about, but they're not of any actual import.\n\n02:32.960 --> 02:37.960\nBut everybody's talking about that because we live in a hive mind.\n\n02:37.960 --> 02:42.960\nAll right.\n\n02:42.960 --> 02:50.960\nSo this hive mind thing and its relationship with our individual lives and also the things that actually are important,\n\n02:50.960 --> 02:54.960\nkind of intersect with this concept today.\n\n02:54.960 --> 03:01.960\nThis news that I woke to this morning on Twitter that Fred Phelps, the West Baptist Church fellow,\n\n03:01.960 --> 03:07.960\nwho's just famous for its God hates bag slogan, that he's on his death bed.\n\n03:07.960 --> 03:11.960\nThe reason we get that news is because his son said something on Facebook.\n\n03:11.960 --> 03:19.960\nIn the same Facebook message, his son threw out the idea that Fred Phelps had been excommunicated\n\n03:19.960 --> 03:25.960\nfrom the West Baptist Church, for Westboro Baptist Church, for a year or more.\n\n03:25.960 --> 03:31.960\nI started doing like a little Nancy Drew, Googling, because I was like, what do you mean he was excommunicated?\n\n03:31.960 --> 03:36.960\nAnd I once, you know, I should care about more important things.\n\n03:36.960 --> 03:40.960\nI should be Googling how to give Africa clean water.\n\n03:40.960 --> 03:45.960\nAnd figuring it out. But instead I spent a good 40 minutes today going like,\n\n03:45.960 --> 03:50.960\nwell, when did Fred Phelps get excommunicated? What does that mean?\n\n03:50.960 --> 03:55.960\nSo it's really interesting to me.\n\n03:55.960 --> 04:02.960\nThere's a lot of straight gay advocates on Twitter today and I'm not taking anything away from them.\n\n04:02.960 --> 04:07.960\nI'm not going to high road people who are high roading people.\n\n04:07.960 --> 04:15.960\nThis is a great chance for everybody to spike a football on the grave of an absolutely unrepentant homophobe.\n\n04:15.960 --> 04:23.960\nSomebody who's the lightning rod for everything that we say is the reason why we need to be progressive,\n\n04:23.960 --> 04:26.960\nlike the whole idea.\n\n04:26.960 --> 04:30.960\nAnd then you start peeling back the layers and you go, well, why was this guy famous?\n\n04:30.960 --> 04:38.960\nI started reading blogs by, you know, advocates and, you know, gay bloggers.\n\n04:38.960 --> 04:44.960\nI thought that would be funnier than it was.\n\n04:44.960 --> 04:57.960\nLike this sort of spirit rose through the lard that was like, okay, let's do what this guy didn't do.\n\n04:57.960 --> 05:02.960\nLet's not pick at his funeral. Let's not, let's not, let's look at this guy for what he was.\n\n05:02.960 --> 05:07.960\nHe was a crazy old man. He had a congregation of about 11.\n\n05:07.960 --> 05:15.960\nAnd I think the reason why he was famous is because we all have this sort of impulse in our minds to protect ourselves and each other.\n\n05:15.960 --> 05:22.960\nAnd it's like, and where has he been since this excommunication?\n\n05:22.960 --> 05:27.960\nThis is the point where I'll invite anybody who knows more about this than I do.\n\n05:27.960 --> 05:31.960\nI just want to dump what I know on the table so that you're not coming up for no reason.\n\n05:31.960 --> 05:43.960\nBut was he excommunicated possibly because he found out he was dying and like most people wanted to just say before he went out,\n\n05:43.960 --> 05:53.960\nsorry, I fucked up. I did that because I was angry and I, and no matter how many times I tell you, you're not going to live forever.\n\n05:53.960 --> 05:56.960\nI realized right at the end that this is no joke.\n\n05:56.960 --> 06:03.960\nYou're saying that his church might have excommunicated him because he repented about not being homophobic?\n\n06:03.960 --> 06:08.960\nThese are the weird things is that his son, who's long since out of the church, like all of his sons, I believe,\n\n06:08.960 --> 06:16.960\nFacebook said, well, my dad is on his deathbed and he's been excommunicated for a year.\n\n06:16.960 --> 06:27.960\nAnd in the body of that Facebook entry, comments on the idea that the family won't let anyone talk to this guy.\n\n06:27.960 --> 06:32.960\nThey won't let anyone who's also excommunicated talk to him.\n\n06:32.960 --> 06:37.960\nThat's what made me go, what's going on here?\n\n06:37.960 --> 06:40.960\nThis is all just gossip and garbage. This isn't news.\n\n06:40.960 --> 06:45.960\nTo get excommunicated would be to not be as homophobic as you're supposed to be.\n\n06:45.960 --> 06:48.960\nTo come back on that stance.\n\n06:48.960 --> 07:01.960\nThat's what I'm asking. The guy that God hates fags, Colonel Sanders, is sick and dying and was apparently excommunicated a while ago\n\n07:01.960 --> 07:07.960\nand no one can talk to him, including people who have also been excommunicated, which he is.\n\n07:07.960 --> 07:11.960\nAnd I kept trying to untangle that and I spent 40 minutes and then I gave up.\n\n07:11.960 --> 07:16.960\nSo does anybody in the audience able to untangle any of that?\n\n07:16.960 --> 07:19.960\nOkay, I see three heads shaking.\n\n07:19.960 --> 07:22.960\nSo that's good.\n\n07:22.960 --> 07:28.960\nNow we imbue it with our mythology, which I believe is probably the uplifting part of that is\n\n07:28.960 --> 07:31.960\nsomewhere there's an old man dying.\n\n07:31.960 --> 07:34.960\nBecause in a properly functioning church you get excommunicated for saying the things that he said.\n\n07:34.960 --> 07:41.960\nYour theory is that he might have been excommunicated because he stopped toe on the party line and stopped being a...\n\n07:41.960 --> 07:45.960\nHere's my theory. It's not based on science at all. I don't care.\n\n07:45.960 --> 07:50.960\nBecause I'm a fan of story and character and mythology and this isn't news. This is gossip.\n\n07:50.960 --> 07:55.960\nThis guy was only ever famous. God bless everyone who made him famous\n\n07:55.960 --> 08:02.960\nbecause this whole thing furthered, in my opinion, it's a catalyst.\n\n08:02.960 --> 08:09.960\nIt fires up gay rights advocacy when you look at somebody standing outside a navy funeral\n\n08:09.960 --> 08:13.960\nwith a sign that says God hates fags. That was the whole point of this.\n\n08:13.960 --> 08:18.960\nIt was iconography. This person didn't have tanks outside of Poland.\n\n08:18.960 --> 08:23.960\nThis person had a couple of fucking rednecks hanging out with him in his living room.\n\n08:23.960 --> 08:26.960\nThat was his congregation.\n\n08:26.960 --> 08:31.960\nThe interesting story about this as he dies and lies in his death bed is\n\n08:31.960 --> 08:39.960\nis he dying in isolation? Does he actually want to say to somebody that he's sorry?\n\n08:39.960 --> 08:47.960\nIs he being denied that? That's what's crazy to me. That's what's fascinating.\n\n08:47.960 --> 08:49.960\nWe have to find out. I hate mysteries.\n\n08:49.960 --> 08:54.960\nWe have that and the Malaysian plane looming over our heads right now.\n\n08:54.960 --> 08:57.960\nMalaysian plane segments!\n\n08:57.960 --> 09:00.960\nPlay the Malaysian pink.\n\n09:05.960 --> 09:10.960\nThere's a plane that was flying and it disappeared and nobody knows where it went.\n\n09:10.960 --> 09:15.960\nIt's the new balloon boy. It's a Malaysian plane.\n\n09:15.960 --> 09:21.960\nBut it's more tragic because real human lives are happening.\n\n09:21.960 --> 09:25.960\nDo you remember the balloon boy?\n\n09:25.960 --> 09:31.960\nHere's the part of the balloon boy thing that I didn't remember and never knew about.\n\n09:31.960 --> 09:37.960\nI was busy. I was making TV history somewhere when balloon boy was happening.\n\n09:37.960 --> 09:43.960\nI was floating over the tree tops of Fox having a pitch meeting.\n\n09:43.960 --> 09:52.960\nThere's a balloon boy. There's a boy in the balloon and the balloon is floating all around.\n\n09:52.960 --> 09:59.960\nI saw you shake your head at the audience and I saw them. I know you guys are all against me.\n\n09:59.960 --> 10:02.960\nWe were watching the balloon.\n\n10:02.960 --> 10:04.960\nYou're the balloon boy.\n\n10:04.960 --> 10:13.960\nThere's a Rick and Morty writer who pulled this up on the YouTube and showed us.\n\n10:13.960 --> 10:19.960\nDo you guys remember when this happened that on CNN or something?\n\n10:19.960 --> 10:25.960\nThe moment when it broke that the balloon boy thing was a hoax, a deliberate hoax.\n\n10:25.960 --> 10:28.960\nNot a hoax on the part of the kid but an engineered hoax on the part of the dad.\n\n10:28.960 --> 10:31.960\nI didn't remember any of this. I didn't care about the balloon boy.\n\n10:31.960 --> 10:35.960\nYou're busy during certain public events.\n\n10:35.960 --> 10:37.960\nHe was never in the balloon, right?\n\n10:37.960 --> 10:39.960\nHe was never in the balloon. Then the dad was like...\n\n10:39.960 --> 10:44.960\nThere's a news clip. Does everyone see the...\n\n10:44.960 --> 10:47.960\nWith the fart?\n\n10:47.960 --> 10:49.960\nMost of the...\n\n10:49.960 --> 10:52.960\nI didn't know anything about this.\n\n10:52.960 --> 10:55.960\nKumail's shaking his head so that's good enough for me.\n\n10:55.960 --> 11:02.960\nAre you shaking your head going, why are you trucking out the balloon boy?\n\n11:02.960 --> 11:05.960\nNo, I don't know what the fart does.\n\n11:05.960 --> 11:08.960\nOkay, okay, good. That's what I thought.\n\n11:08.960 --> 11:11.960\nLater on tonight, Kumail Anjiani will be our guest.\n\n11:11.960 --> 11:16.960\nI have another reason to be upset. You now have a better Kumail impression than I do.\n\n11:16.960 --> 11:19.960\nThat was pretty good.\n\n11:19.960 --> 11:25.960\nYou walk a fucking tightrope, you do a Kumail impression because...\n\n11:25.960 --> 11:31.960\nKumail's career has become a monument to not fucking selling out,\n\n11:31.960 --> 11:36.960\nnot trading on the things that make him different from the people that are watching.\n\n11:36.960 --> 11:39.960\nYou know what I mean? I don't know if I'm not articulating that well enough,\n\n11:39.960 --> 11:41.960\nbut I remember early on him coming out,\n\n11:41.960 --> 11:43.960\nevery conversation I had with him talking about like,\n\n11:43.960 --> 11:46.960\noh yeah, I'll go for this audition. I won't go for that one.\n\n11:46.960 --> 11:49.960\nHere's the meticulous reason why.\n\n11:49.960 --> 11:53.960\nThe fact that it pays off if you're smart and actually further...\n\n11:53.960 --> 11:56.960\nAnyway, I'm embarrassing him.\n\n11:56.960 --> 11:59.960\nThe last thing you want to do is reward all of that by going like,\n\n11:59.960 --> 12:02.960\noh I'm Kumail, look at me.\n\n12:02.960 --> 12:06.960\nBut that will be the end result of everything\n\n12:06.960 --> 12:09.960\nbecause if he becomes Woody Allen, then what happens?\n\n12:09.960 --> 12:11.960\nWoody Allen.\n\n12:11.960 --> 12:13.960\nYou celebrate someone's...\n\n12:13.960 --> 12:15.960\nWas that Kumail or Woody Allen?\n\n12:15.960 --> 12:19.960\nAll right, so just Google this, find it somehow.\n\n12:19.960 --> 12:21.960\nThey're on a couch, right?\n\n12:21.960 --> 12:24.960\nThey're all on a couch, they're all on a couch in a row.\n\n12:24.960 --> 12:28.960\nAnd the dad is like, hey, why didn't you...\n\n12:28.960 --> 12:32.960\nThe CNN wants to know, why didn't you come out when you were hiding?\n\n12:32.960 --> 12:38.960\nAnd the kid goes like, hi, you told us that it was for the show?\n\n12:38.960 --> 12:40.960\nAnd the dad goes...\n\n12:40.960 --> 12:42.960\nAnd then there's this...\n\n12:42.960 --> 12:49.960\nAnd you can spend three hours watching it, debating whether it's the kid\n\n12:49.960 --> 12:52.960\nor the dad that's farting.\n\n12:53.960 --> 12:56.960\nIt's really, really great.\n\n12:56.960 --> 12:58.960\nI just think there was a lot going on in the world\n\n12:58.960 --> 13:01.960\nand also a lot going on during that CNN satellite interview.\n\n13:01.960 --> 13:05.960\nSo it just kind of slipped by us, it wasn't like the fart herd around the world.\n\n13:05.960 --> 13:08.960\nIt really needs, we need to go back.\n\n13:08.960 --> 13:11.960\nWere their charges filed or pressed?\n\n13:11.960 --> 13:14.960\nDid someone go to jail or get fined for that?\n\n13:14.960 --> 13:16.960\nFor wasting our time?\n\n13:16.960 --> 13:18.960\nIs that one of those things where there's no fining?\n\n13:18.960 --> 13:20.960\nYes, actually they had to pay restitution.\n\n13:20.960 --> 13:22.960\nI think I looked it up on Wikipedia.\n\n13:22.960 --> 13:24.960\nI think they had to give a little bit of restitution.\n\n13:24.960 --> 13:26.960\nNo, wait, did they?\n\n13:26.960 --> 13:28.960\nRestitution.\n\n13:28.960 --> 13:30.960\nNo, I think I'm mixing something else up.\n\n13:30.960 --> 13:33.960\nBecause I think CNN, you know...\n\n13:35.960 --> 13:37.960\nI just high-fived Kumail.\n\n13:37.960 --> 13:41.960\nYou know what I picture happening in the parking lot of that whole event?\n\n13:41.960 --> 13:46.960\nIs the government coming up to a circus of news cameramen and producers\n\n13:46.960 --> 13:48.960\nand going like, anybody want to press charges?\n\n13:48.960 --> 13:51.960\nAnd they're like, no, we're good.\n\n13:51.960 --> 13:53.960\nWe did it.\n\n13:53.960 --> 13:58.960\nWe got everything out of this we would have gotten if a baby had been in a balloon.\n\n13:58.960 --> 14:00.960\nThat's what's for sale.\n\n14:00.960 --> 14:02.960\nBuy Snickers. Good night.\n\n14:02.960 --> 14:09.960\nIt's a stupid question to ask. How does a plane disappear in a world full of surveillance,\n\n14:09.960 --> 14:11.960\na big-ass plane full of human beings?\n\n14:11.960 --> 14:13.960\nHow do they not fucking know?\n\n14:13.960 --> 14:15.960\nI don't know. Let Rob Delaney talk about that.\n\n14:15.960 --> 14:17.960\nWhat was your conspiracy theory earlier?\n\n14:17.960 --> 14:20.960\nOh, okay, come on.\n\n14:20.960 --> 14:22.960\nNo, but that was over drinks.\n\n14:22.960 --> 14:28.960\nI don't know, is it politically incorrect right now to be making bits about...\n\n14:28.960 --> 14:33.960\nThese people are gone dead. These are human beings.\n\n14:33.960 --> 14:35.960\nIt's in poor taste to do bits.\n\n14:35.960 --> 14:39.960\nI wouldn't call it a bit about the tragedy of these people dying.\n\n14:39.960 --> 14:41.960\nI was just saying...\n\n14:41.960 --> 14:44.960\nNo, but my bit is specifically hint, never mind.\n\n14:44.960 --> 14:47.960\nIt was a sci-fi conceit, that's all. Everyone's thinking about it.\n\n14:47.960 --> 14:52.960\nYou were saying that as a fetishist of storytelling...\n\n14:52.960 --> 14:54.960\nOver drinks, we were saying this.\n\n14:54.960 --> 14:59.960\nBut as a fetishist of story and story structure and character,\n\n14:59.960 --> 15:03.960\nthat you can't help but project onto this...\n\n15:03.960 --> 15:06.960\nLike a guy in goggles coming in the cockpit and going,\n\n15:06.960 --> 15:10.960\nlisten, you have to take this plane down.\n\n15:10.960 --> 15:15.960\nThere's a guy in E3 that's going to give birth to Hitler.\n\n15:15.960 --> 15:18.960\nNew Hitler.\n\n15:18.960 --> 15:20.960\nNose dive now.\n\n15:20.960 --> 15:24.960\nIt's not funny.\n\n15:24.960 --> 15:27.960\nShame on you.\n\n15:27.960 --> 15:29.960\nOriginally it wasn't New Hitler.\n\n15:29.960 --> 15:33.960\nIt was the guy who was going to give birth to space aides.\n\n15:33.960 --> 15:39.960\nI haven't even typed a word of this yet.\n\n15:39.960 --> 15:44.960\nI want to thank Greg and Charles for buying me a drink at the drawing room.\n\n15:44.960 --> 15:46.960\nThey came here from San Jose.\n\n15:46.960 --> 15:49.960\nThere's always a pilgrimage that comes out here.\n\n15:49.960 --> 15:51.960\nGreg, are you here?\n\n15:51.960 --> 15:53.960\nHey, Greg.\n\n15:53.960 --> 15:57.960\nGreg and Charles drove five hours from San Jose.\n\n15:57.960 --> 15:59.960\nWho else drove further?\n\n15:59.960 --> 16:03.960\nSan Francisco?\n\n16:03.960 --> 16:05.960\nSacramento.\n\n16:05.960 --> 16:07.960\nSacramento.\n\n16:07.960 --> 16:09.960\nNow we get into what you drove here for.\n\n16:09.960 --> 16:11.960\nAnd those guys drove here for how it's made.\n\n16:11.960 --> 16:13.960\nAnybody here from Malaysian flight 441?\n\n16:13.960 --> 16:17.960\nTo me, it's not funny. To Jeff, it is.\n\n16:17.960 --> 16:19.960\nI want that on record for TMZ.\n\n16:19.960 --> 16:21.960\nThat's a different flight number.\n\n16:21.960 --> 16:23.960\nIs it right?\n\n16:23.960 --> 16:25.960\nDid I get it right?\n\n16:25.960 --> 16:29.960\nThe 370, that's not funny.\n\n16:29.960 --> 16:35.960\nFlight 441 landed safely in Beijing hours ago.\n\n16:35.960 --> 16:41.960\nThank you Greg and Charles for buying me a drink at the drawing room before the show.\n\n16:41.960 --> 16:44.960\nEverybody that drove here tonight, sorry.\n\n16:44.960 --> 16:48.960\nIt's $10. What the fuck do you want?\n\n16:48.960 --> 16:52.960\nHow about that Fred Phelps?\n\n16:52.960 --> 16:56.960\nLet's do our next segment, our regular annual segment,\n\n16:56.960 --> 17:08.960\nSouth by Southwest Breakdown with Kumail Nanjiani!\n\n17:08.960 --> 17:12.960\nHello, hello.\n\n17:12.960 --> 17:16.960\nHello, hello.\n\n17:16.960 --> 17:18.960\nHow's it going guys?\n\n17:18.960 --> 17:20.960\nIt's going good.\n\n17:20.960 --> 17:22.960\nCan I just say this?\n\n17:22.960 --> 17:24.960\nOh, no.\n\n17:24.960 --> 17:28.960\nCan I just say, this is me, I'm Camille!\n\n17:28.960 --> 17:32.960\nHey everybody!\n\n17:32.960 --> 17:38.960\nNo, I bet that's not what Fred Phelps' thing is, unfortunately.\n\n17:38.960 --> 17:40.960\nI'm sure his brain is gone.\n\n17:40.960 --> 17:42.960\nWhy would they excommunicate him?\n\n17:42.960 --> 17:46.960\nWhy wouldn't they deify him and put him under a glass?\n\n17:46.960 --> 17:48.960\nBecause he's probably crazy and shitting his pants or something.\n\n17:48.960 --> 17:52.960\nWhy would they excommunicate him?\n\n17:52.960 --> 17:54.960\nThat's a specific thing.\n\n17:54.960 --> 18:00.960\nThis may all be based on one thing that his one kid said on Facebook,\n\n18:00.960 --> 18:04.960\nand now it's been added to his Wikipedia.\n\n18:04.960 --> 18:06.960\nBecause we don't actually know.\n\n18:06.960 --> 18:10.960\nFred Phelps' excommunication, and the only thing that's there\n\n18:10.960 --> 18:14.960\nis this continual reference to the fact that his kid said that.\n\n18:14.960 --> 18:16.960\nI will say, I've never been sexually attracted to a guy,\n\n18:16.960 --> 18:20.960\nbut I will make out with a dude at his funeral.\n\n18:20.960 --> 18:24.960\nI thought you were going to say, I would fuck Fred Phelps.\n\n18:24.960 --> 18:28.960\nIf he's up for it, I'll take that hit for everybody.\n\n18:28.960 --> 18:32.960\nWhat if he comes out before he dies?\n\n18:32.960 --> 18:34.960\nWhat if that was it?\n\n18:34.960 --> 18:38.960\nWould it be the biggest shock in the world,\n\n18:38.960 --> 18:42.960\nor would it be the third, fourth, eighth biggest shock in the history of...\n\n18:42.960 --> 18:50.960\nMy brief Googling, he was a lawyer and he was a civil rights activist.\n\n18:50.960 --> 18:52.960\nHe was?\n\n18:52.960 --> 18:54.960\nHe was a civil rights activist.\n\n18:54.960 --> 18:56.960\nSomething happened to this guy.\n\n18:56.960 --> 19:02.960\nSomething happened to everyone who decides that in addition to letting gay people\n\n19:02.960 --> 19:06.960\njust be alienated by virtue of being gay, that you actually have to go after them.\n\n19:06.960 --> 19:10.960\nSomething has to happen to you to pick on gay people.\n\n19:10.960 --> 19:12.960\nAt funerals of like soldiers who've died,\n\n19:12.960 --> 19:14.960\nthat's such a long connection to make,\n\n19:14.960 --> 19:20.960\nbecause the connection is that wars are God's way of punishing homosexuality\n\n19:20.960 --> 19:23.960\nin our sins, so the people who go to war are...\n\n19:23.960 --> 19:25.960\nWhat's the logic? Does anyone know what the logic is?\n\n19:25.960 --> 19:28.960\nBecause he's not protesting funerals of gay people.\n\n19:28.960 --> 19:31.960\nHe's protesting soldiers who've died in wars.\n\n19:31.960 --> 19:34.960\nSome holdover... Yeah, it wasn't gay soldiers, right?\n\n19:34.960 --> 19:39.960\nIt wasn't gay soldiers. It's something like war happens because gays,\n\n19:39.960 --> 19:41.960\nso if we go to...\n\n19:41.960 --> 19:44.960\nAnd it's weirdly, I think, like supporting the dead soldiers.\n\n19:44.960 --> 19:47.960\nLike, hey, if we didn't have gays, your son would still be alive.\n\n19:47.960 --> 19:49.960\nLike, it's some weird logic like that.\n\n19:49.960 --> 19:51.960\nI didn't know that. I always assumed it was...\n\n19:51.960 --> 19:55.960\nThat's right, right? I mean, it's wrong, but it's right.\n\n19:55.960 --> 19:57.960\nIt's so wrong, it's right.\n\n19:57.960 --> 19:59.960\nSomebody back there feels pretty strong that that's right.\n\n19:59.960 --> 20:01.960\nYeah, feels right.\n\n20:01.960 --> 20:02.960\nFeels right.\n\n20:02.960 --> 20:04.960\nWhat a long... What a pitch meeting where he's like,\n\n20:04.960 --> 20:07.960\nlisten, guys, I got an idea. You have to stay with me.\n\n20:07.960 --> 20:09.960\nIt's a long way to get there.\n\n20:09.960 --> 20:11.960\nGo long.\n\n20:11.960 --> 20:13.960\nYeah, go long.\n\n20:13.960 --> 20:15.960\nHold up both hands. Good luck.\n\n20:15.960 --> 20:20.960\nI went on a rabbit hole today because the first thing that happens is the Twitter jokes.\n\n20:20.960 --> 20:21.960\nWait, what's happening?\n\n20:21.960 --> 20:22.960\nI'm not... You're wrong.\n\n20:22.960 --> 20:23.960\nIt's wrong.\n\n20:23.960 --> 20:27.960\nI have a really strong source right here.\n\n20:27.960 --> 20:29.960\nOkay, well, what is it? Why does he...\n\n20:29.960 --> 20:31.960\nWhat else is here?\n\n20:31.960 --> 20:33.960\nWhat is it?\n\n20:33.960 --> 20:37.960\nIt's because soldiers are fighting for this country and this country is supporting gay people.\n\n20:37.960 --> 20:38.960\nOh, okay.\n\n20:38.960 --> 20:40.960\nOkay, so it's sort of similar.\n\n20:40.960 --> 20:45.960\nShe said soldiers are supporting this country and this country supports gay people, so...\n\n20:45.960 --> 20:48.960\nYou're a gay by association.\n\n20:48.960 --> 20:51.960\nSo it is anti the soldiers that are dying.\n\n20:51.960 --> 20:55.960\nYeah, they deserve to die because they support the gay vote in our country.\n\n20:55.960 --> 20:57.960\nHe says Faganabler.\n\n20:57.960 --> 21:00.960\nFaganabler? He calls soldiers Faganablers?\n\n21:00.960 --> 21:04.960\nFaganabler is actually the name of my battle bot.\n\n21:04.960 --> 21:09.960\nI don't know if you guys remember when I was a contender in battle bots.\n\n21:09.960 --> 21:10.960\nIt did pretty well, right?\n\n21:10.960 --> 21:13.960\nI never meant it to be pronounced that way.\n\n21:13.960 --> 21:15.960\nIt's Faganabler.\n\n21:15.960 --> 21:20.960\nIt was Dr. Faganabler.\n\n21:20.960 --> 21:25.960\nIn the UK, they just thought it was a guy who sold cigarettes to miners.\n\n21:25.960 --> 21:28.960\nI went down a brief rabbit hole.\n\n21:28.960 --> 21:36.960\nI think the internet is such a beautiful pudding of hatred and toxicity and juvenileity and outrage and reflex.\n\n21:36.960 --> 21:43.960\nAnd then these beautiful clouds and streaks of, oh my God, we're all going to be fine.\n\n21:43.960 --> 22:04.960\nI just went down the rabbit hole of a lot of wonderful blog essays from gay people whose straight friends are absolutely justifiably taking the opportunity to go,\n\n22:04.960 --> 22:14.960\nyeah, burn in hell, you fucking fag hater, but who personally just want to take the time to say, you know, just more of the same.\n\n22:14.960 --> 22:20.960\nNot to cast dispersions, not to, I appreciate the advocacy, I appreciate the support,\n\n22:20.960 --> 22:30.960\nbut this is just an old senile man who was pushed to the forefront in the media because of an agenda that needs to be made conscious of\n\n22:30.960 --> 22:37.960\nand to hate each other for anything is always the wrong answer.\n\n22:37.960 --> 22:44.960\nBut I also understand, like, if you're gay and you're persecuted and there's a guy who's protesting soldiers' funerals because they're Faganablers,\n\n22:44.960 --> 22:47.960\nI mean, I can understand someone being really angry about it.\n\n22:47.960 --> 22:49.960\nEveryone has permission to do it.\n\n22:49.960 --> 22:55.960\nNobody is going to punish you for doing it, so what do you do in that moment?\n\n22:55.960 --> 23:02.960\nNobody is going to judge you for stabbing this guy in the face, so here's your knife.\n\n23:02.960 --> 23:03.960\nWhat is he dying for?\n\n23:03.960 --> 23:04.960\nWhat are you going to do?\n\n23:04.960 --> 23:09.960\nI guess, I don't know the details, huh?\n\n23:09.960 --> 23:11.960\nYeah, he got spaces.\n\n23:11.960 --> 23:15.960\nI was trying to think of what the joke would be, I'm like, what am I doing?\n\n23:15.960 --> 23:16.960\nI couldn't think of the joke either.\n\n23:16.960 --> 23:18.960\nThere's a Sudoku puzzle on my chest.\n\n23:18.960 --> 23:19.960\nIt's hard.\n\n23:19.960 --> 23:23.960\nDo we know how he's dying? Is he dead? Is he hanging on?\n\n23:23.960 --> 23:26.960\nHe's super old. I think he's just dying because...\n\n23:26.960 --> 23:28.960\nBecause the ravages of time.\n\n23:28.960 --> 23:29.960\nThe ravages of time, yeah.\n\n23:29.960 --> 23:30.960\nAnd space aids.\n\n23:30.960 --> 23:31.960\nYeah.\n\n23:31.960 --> 23:32.960\nYeah.\n\n23:32.960 --> 23:33.960\nAlright, enough about this ass.\n\n23:33.960 --> 23:37.960\nIf we talk about him a second longer than Harold Ramis, I'll fucking kill myself.\n\n23:37.960 --> 23:40.960\nThen the world is committed to crime.\n\n23:40.960 --> 23:41.960\nYeah.\n\n23:41.960 --> 23:43.960\nI wasn't here when you guys talked about Harold Ramis.\n\n23:43.960 --> 23:44.960\nThat was...\n\n23:44.960 --> 23:49.960\nI had this weird thing, so I do this podcast called The Inner Kids with Emily,\n\n23:49.960 --> 23:53.960\nand I started talking about, oh, thank you, Harold Ramis.\n\n23:53.960 --> 23:55.960\nAnd I started crying, and I couldn't stop crying.\n\n23:55.960 --> 23:59.960\nAnd I figured out it was because, and I told the story there,\n\n23:59.960 --> 24:02.960\ndo we want to talk about Harold Ramis again?\n\n24:02.960 --> 24:04.960\nSure, no, tell, yeah.\n\n24:04.960 --> 24:05.960\nOkay, so this happened...\n\n24:05.960 --> 24:06.960\nI want to see you cry.\n\n24:06.960 --> 24:07.960\nNo, I'm not going to cry.\n\n24:07.960 --> 24:10.960\nWatch me not cry, motherfuckers.\n\n24:10.960 --> 24:13.960\nAlready, it's hard.\n\n24:13.960 --> 24:16.960\nNo, because obviously I loved Ghostbusters and stuff, but...\n\n24:16.960 --> 24:18.960\nHe's already crying.\n\n24:18.960 --> 24:22.960\nYes, I'm crying out.\n\n24:22.960 --> 24:23.960\nGroundhog Day.\n\n24:23.960 --> 24:26.960\nI love that movie, and this is sort of a weird story,\n\n24:26.960 --> 24:28.960\nbut stick with it because she's okay now.\n\n24:28.960 --> 24:31.960\nBut when Emily and I first started dating, she got really sick,\n\n24:31.960 --> 24:33.960\nand it was like this weird, mysterious thing.\n\n24:33.960 --> 24:36.960\nAnd we'd been only dating a few months, and she was in a coma for eight days.\n\n24:36.960 --> 24:37.960\nIt's a crazy...\n\n24:37.960 --> 24:38.960\nYeah, it's sort of out of nowhere.\n\n24:38.960 --> 24:39.960\nDid you hit her?\n\n24:39.960 --> 24:40.960\nHuh?\n\n24:40.960 --> 24:47.960\nWhile she was in a coma, then she's not learning her lesson.\n\n24:47.960 --> 24:50.960\nWow, that was a roller coaster of...\n\n24:50.960 --> 24:51.960\nYeah!\n\n24:51.960 --> 24:54.960\nAnd that's the story I wanted to tell.\n\n24:54.960 --> 24:55.960\nThat's...\n\n24:55.960 --> 24:58.960\nI hope somebody was recording that exchange.\n\n24:58.960 --> 25:01.960\nWe're back in Hollywood Squares.\n\n25:01.960 --> 25:03.960\nNew comedy golden age.\n\n25:03.960 --> 25:06.960\nThey want to move me to Center Square because of that exchange.\n\n25:06.960 --> 25:11.960\nThey're like, we're getting Bruce Valencia out of there.\n\n25:11.960 --> 25:13.960\nSo she got really sick, and it was crazy,\n\n25:13.960 --> 25:15.960\nand we'd only been dating a few months, and...\n\n25:15.960 --> 25:17.960\nOh, God.\n\n25:17.960 --> 25:18.960\nHer parents...\n\n25:18.960 --> 25:19.960\nSo her parents and I hung out for a while,\n\n25:19.960 --> 25:21.960\nand that's when I sort of told my parents\n\n25:21.960 --> 25:24.960\nthat I wasn't going to marry the woman that they found for me,\n\n25:24.960 --> 25:26.960\nthat it was going to be this woman who's in a coma,\n\n25:26.960 --> 25:28.960\nwho's hopefully going to come out,\n\n25:28.960 --> 25:30.960\nand if she comes out, I'm going to marry her.\n\n25:30.960 --> 25:32.960\nAnd if she doesn't, well, then the world ends anyway.\n\n25:32.960 --> 25:33.960\nSo, oh, God.\n\n25:33.960 --> 25:34.960\nOkay.\n\n25:34.960 --> 25:36.960\nBut when she finally came out, and she was fine,\n\n25:36.960 --> 25:38.960\nand the first night I got to stay in the hospital with her,\n\n25:38.960 --> 25:41.960\nand she was up, I was allowed to bring in a laptop.\n\n25:41.960 --> 25:44.960\nAnd I was like, what movie do we want to watch?\n\n25:44.960 --> 25:45.960\nThe Groundhog Day.\n\n25:45.960 --> 25:47.960\nAnd it was so profound, because every day,\n\n25:47.960 --> 25:49.960\nI've been at the hospital all day, every day,\n\n25:49.960 --> 25:51.960\nso it sort of was living Groundhog Day.\n\n25:51.960 --> 25:53.960\nLike, it was the same day over and over,\n\n25:53.960 --> 25:55.960\nbut I remember watching this movie with Emily,\n\n25:55.960 --> 25:57.960\nwho's up now, and being like,\n\n25:57.960 --> 25:59.960\noh, everything's going to be okay.\n\n25:59.960 --> 26:01.960\nSo, you know, you sort of connect to people\n\n26:01.960 --> 26:03.960\nbecause of the things they've done,\n\n26:03.960 --> 26:05.960\nbut that was like a very special thing for me.\n\n26:05.960 --> 26:09.960\nSo when he sort of died, that really, like, hit me.\n\n26:09.960 --> 26:11.960\nNot hard, but in a way, I was like,\n\n26:11.960 --> 26:14.960\noh, that guy had a profound effect on both our lives\n\n26:14.960 --> 26:17.960\nin a way that he never really, he doesn't know, you know?\n\n26:17.960 --> 26:18.960\nHe has no idea what that means.\n\n26:18.960 --> 26:21.960\nYeah, it was never really, it wasn't one of the people,\n\n26:21.960 --> 26:25.960\nthe people whose impact we acknowledge while they're alive.\n\n26:25.960 --> 26:26.960\nYeah.\n\n26:26.960 --> 26:28.960\nI don't know what their deal is,\n\n26:28.960 --> 26:30.960\nbut I know that the really important people\n\n26:30.960 --> 26:33.960\nare the people who unexpectedly, like,\n\n26:33.960 --> 26:36.960\nthat blanket has slipped out from underneath us,\n\n26:36.960 --> 26:38.960\nand suddenly, everything is disrupted.\n\n26:38.960 --> 26:41.960\nAnd I know, and I've confessed to this,\n\n26:41.960 --> 26:43.960\nI know this is all narcissism and all ego,\n\n26:43.960 --> 26:45.960\nbut how else are you supposed to process someone else's death?\n\n26:45.960 --> 26:46.960\nRight.\n\n26:46.960 --> 26:49.960\nBut I've had, yeah, whatever.\n\n26:49.960 --> 26:51.960\nI'm repeating myself, but I'm walking down a sidewalk\n\n26:51.960 --> 26:53.960\nand per bank, and I'm just processing this\n\n26:53.960 --> 26:55.960\nand the way I do every celebrity death,\n\n26:55.960 --> 26:57.960\nand like, what does this mean to me?\n\n26:57.960 --> 26:59.960\nWhy was he important, and then all of a sudden,\n\n26:59.960 --> 27:01.960\nI'm just fucking weeping.\n\n27:01.960 --> 27:06.960\nAnd it was definitely because this was a purveyor of,\n\n27:06.960 --> 27:10.960\nI mean, like Groundhog Day is,\n\n27:10.960 --> 27:15.960\nit should definitely be put in a canister\n\n27:15.960 --> 27:17.960\nand shot toward other planets,\n\n27:17.960 --> 27:21.960\nbecause it's the best we can do in a modern civilization\n\n27:21.960 --> 27:29.960\nof creating a new, not a, I mean, there's creation myths,\n\n27:29.960 --> 27:31.960\nbut then there's the part of mythology\n\n27:31.960 --> 27:37.960\nthat just tells you, like, you know, soothes you,\n\n27:37.960 --> 27:39.960\nlike reminds you that everything's fucked\n\n27:39.960 --> 27:42.960\nand that you need to be who you are,\n\n27:42.960 --> 27:45.960\nand it's a story about God holding a man still\n\n27:45.960 --> 27:50.960\nuntil he can't stop, until he can't squirm anymore.\n\n27:50.960 --> 27:52.960\nAnd you just watch it happen,\n\n27:52.960 --> 27:59.960\nand what's amazing about that movie is that any hokey or movie\n\n27:59.960 --> 28:04.960\nwould have easily gotten away with ending the story with him\n\n28:04.960 --> 28:10.960\njust becoming a good guy to her and learning her favorite color,\n\n28:10.960 --> 28:12.960\nand I've got ice cream on the windowsill,\n\n28:12.960 --> 28:16.960\nand in that movie, that's where shit really goes bad,\n\n28:16.960 --> 28:19.960\nbecause he's really becoming an asshole now,\n\n28:19.960 --> 28:20.960\nbecause it's one thing to rob a bank,\n\n28:20.960 --> 28:23.960\nand it's one thing to eat all the M&Ms you want,\n\n28:23.960 --> 28:28.960\nbut it's another thing to fucking fabricate\n\n28:28.960 --> 28:31.960\nthe spark between one human and another,\n\n28:31.960 --> 28:34.960\nand then he leaves that rom-com world,\n\n28:34.960 --> 28:37.960\nand he just takes piano lessons and he just, you know,\n\n28:37.960 --> 28:39.960\ncatches the same cat out of the same tree and blah, blah, blah,\n\n28:39.960 --> 28:43.960\nand it's at that point that he actually has something with her.\n\n28:43.960 --> 28:44.960\nAnyways, alright, so...\n\n28:44.960 --> 28:46.960\nLet's see where he's trying to save the homeless men\n\n28:46.960 --> 28:48.960\nfrom dying over and over.\n\n28:48.960 --> 28:50.960\nThat's such a great, like, moment.\n\n28:50.960 --> 28:54.960\nI mean, it's a fantastic, I mean, if aliens attack us\n\n28:54.960 --> 28:57.960\nand they want to kill us, we show them Groundhog Day\n\n28:57.960 --> 29:00.960\nand give them Nutella, and they'll be like, alright.\n\n29:00.960 --> 29:03.960\nYou guys have done good.\n\n29:03.960 --> 29:05.960\nThere should be theologians who study that,\n\n29:05.960 --> 29:09.960\nwho ask things like, does he save the homeless guy\n\n29:09.960 --> 29:11.960\nafter a certain point?\n\n29:11.960 --> 29:13.960\nThe story would indicate that he learned the lesson\n\n29:13.960 --> 29:15.960\nthat that guy's just gonna freeze to death\n\n29:15.960 --> 29:17.960\nand start to death on the sidewalk,\n\n29:17.960 --> 29:19.960\nand you tried everything there,\n\n29:19.960 --> 29:21.960\nso you got a piano lesson and just do it.\n\n29:21.960 --> 29:23.960\nThey don't dwell on that.\n\n29:23.960 --> 29:26.960\nIt's a more uplifting movie than that,\n\n29:26.960 --> 29:28.960\nbut those are also...\n\n29:28.960 --> 29:29.960\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n29:29.960 --> 29:31.960\nYou could launch that movie to Mars,\n\n29:31.960 --> 29:33.960\nstart a civilization based on it,\n\n29:33.960 --> 29:35.960\nand then a new generation could say,\n\n29:35.960 --> 29:37.960\nwell, did he save the homeless guy every time?\n\n29:37.960 --> 29:39.960\nAnd then you could go, well, you know,\n\n29:39.960 --> 29:42.960\nsome people say he did, but other people...\n\n29:42.960 --> 29:45.960\nYou know what, if you've got a piano lesson,\n\n29:45.960 --> 29:47.960\nyou need to learn piano.\n\n29:47.960 --> 29:49.960\nThat's gonna help more people.\n\n29:49.960 --> 29:51.960\nI want to see a sequel to that movie\n\n29:51.960 --> 29:53.960\nwhere it's just him dazzling people\n\n29:53.960 --> 29:55.960\nby making ice sculptures,\n\n29:55.960 --> 29:57.960\nand they're like, where did you find the time?\n\n29:57.960 --> 29:59.960\nThere's a comic book series\n\n29:59.960 --> 30:01.960\nwhere time unfreezes a different time for him,\n\n30:01.960 --> 30:03.960\nand so there's, like, different Bill Murrays\n\n30:03.960 --> 30:05.960\nwho are, like, champion ice sculptors.\n\n30:05.960 --> 30:06.960\nYeah.\n\n30:06.960 --> 30:08.960\nOr, like, what if it ended too early\n\n30:08.960 --> 30:10.960\nand he was, like, halfway good,\n\n30:10.960 --> 30:12.960\nso he's still trying to impress people?\n\n30:12.960 --> 30:14.960\nLike, that's pretty good, right?\n\n30:14.960 --> 30:16.960\nI mean, I can't do the head right,\n\n30:16.960 --> 30:18.960\nbut he's better than you can do.\n\n30:18.960 --> 30:21.960\nAll right, so how was South by Southwest for you?\n\n30:21.960 --> 30:23.960\nOh, I had an awesome time.\n\n30:23.960 --> 30:25.960\nWell, your head was everywhere.\n\n30:25.960 --> 30:28.960\nUh, yeah, they really pushed that show.\n\n30:28.960 --> 30:30.960\nWhat does it like to be in an airport\n\n30:30.960 --> 30:32.960\nwith the huge...\n\n30:32.960 --> 30:37.960\nAnd at the exact moment when I feel\n\n30:37.960 --> 30:39.960\nthe angriest at the government,\n\n30:39.960 --> 30:44.960\nwhen I feel the most put down by mainstream society,\n\n30:44.960 --> 30:48.960\nif my head was above the metal detectors,\n\n30:48.960 --> 30:51.960\nlike, I don't know, I would explode.\n\n30:51.960 --> 30:53.960\nYou're right, it's Orwellian.\n\n30:53.960 --> 30:55.960\nIt kind of feels like, well, it was these guys' idea.\n\n30:55.960 --> 30:57.960\nI get angry at them.\n\n30:57.960 --> 30:58.960\nIt really does feel like that.\n\n30:58.960 --> 31:00.960\nDid it make you feel like taking your shoes off\n\n31:00.960 --> 31:02.960\nwas, did it mitigate?\n\n31:02.960 --> 31:04.960\nOr did it make you feel like...\n\n31:04.960 --> 31:06.960\nI know I had a moment where I was...\n\n31:06.960 --> 31:08.960\nI felt I was in the wrong line,\n\n31:08.960 --> 31:10.960\nlike, I got into the pre-screening line\n\n31:10.960 --> 31:13.960\nand I wasn't pre-screened, and I had this whole thing.\n\n31:13.960 --> 31:15.960\nBecause you'd want to be normal.\n\n31:15.960 --> 31:18.960\nWhere's my ID? It's right behind you, asshole.\n\n31:18.960 --> 31:20.960\nYou motherfucker, have you heard of Mike Judge?\n\n31:20.960 --> 31:24.960\nOkay, well, you should really look into his stuff.\n\n31:24.960 --> 31:26.960\nSo, I was telling you,\n\n31:26.960 --> 31:29.960\nthere were also on cabs and stuff, those pictures,\n\n31:29.960 --> 31:31.960\nand we were all so excited, all five of us,\n\n31:31.960 --> 31:33.960\nand we were walking down the street,\n\n31:33.960 --> 31:34.960\nand this cab was parked there.\n\n31:34.960 --> 31:36.960\nSo, it's me, Martin Starr, T.J.

through every...\n\n35:18.960 --> 35:19.960\nI could tell you from...\n\n35:19.960 --> 35:21.960\nOkay, starts in black and white.\n\n35:21.960 --> 35:23.960\nShe works on a farm.\n\n35:23.960 --> 35:27.960\nShe's bummed out because it's in black and white.\n\n35:27.960 --> 35:30.960\nShe meets every character that you're going to see\n\n35:30.960 --> 35:32.960\nas an animal.\n\n35:32.960 --> 35:34.960\nAnd then a tornado comes.\n\n35:34.960 --> 35:36.960\nShe sings a song, and a tornado comes.\n\n35:36.960 --> 35:38.960\nShe sings a tornado song,\n\n35:38.960 --> 35:41.960\nand the tornado makes everything go into color.\n\n35:41.960 --> 35:43.960\nDo you remember how the tornado song goes?\n\n35:43.960 --> 35:46.960\nSomewhere over the tornado.\n\n35:46.960 --> 35:48.960\nIs that the song?\n\n35:48.960 --> 35:49.960\nSomewhere over the rainbow.\n\n35:49.960 --> 35:52.960\nLike, tornado song, and then she lands...\n\n35:52.960 --> 35:53.960\nShe lands on a witch.\n\n35:53.960 --> 35:56.960\nNow she's committed a crime before she even knows she does.\n\n35:56.960 --> 35:58.960\nThese little people come up and they say,\n\n35:58.960 --> 35:59.960\nlike, you killed the witch.\n\n35:59.960 --> 36:01.960\nAnd then another witch says, like,\n\n36:01.960 --> 36:02.960\nwell, just...\n\n36:02.960 --> 36:03.960\nThere's no problem.\n\n36:03.960 --> 36:05.960\nI know how you can get out of here.\n\n36:05.960 --> 36:07.960\nFollow the Yellow Brick Road.\n\n36:07.960 --> 36:08.960\nSo she follows the Yellow Brick Road.\n\n36:08.960 --> 36:10.960\nShe meets, not necessarily in this order,\n\n36:10.960 --> 36:14.960\na skier crow, an iron man, and a...\n\n36:14.960 --> 36:18.960\nA lion, a lion.\n\n36:18.960 --> 36:22.960\nThat would be great if it was the Iron Man.\n\n36:22.960 --> 36:23.960\nAnd she meets them all.\n\n36:23.960 --> 36:25.960\nThey get attacked in no necessary order\n\n36:25.960 --> 36:27.960\nby trees, monkeys, and poppies.\n\n36:27.960 --> 36:30.960\nAnd then they go to the Emerald City.\n\n36:30.960 --> 36:31.960\nThat's the meeting with the goddess.\n\n36:31.960 --> 36:32.960\nAnd they get there.\n\n36:32.960 --> 36:33.960\nAnd then they atone with the father,\n\n36:33.960 --> 36:35.960\nwhich is the fact that the Wizard of Oz\n\n36:35.960 --> 36:37.960\nis just a shithead behind a curtain.\n\n36:37.960 --> 36:39.960\nToto finds that out.\n\n36:39.960 --> 36:40.960\nAnd then they...\n\n36:40.960 --> 36:41.960\nSomewhere along the line,\n\n36:41.960 --> 36:43.960\nthey make the witch melt with water.\n\n36:43.960 --> 36:46.960\nI don't know if she comes into the Emerald City and is like,\n\n36:46.960 --> 36:47.960\nstop it!\n\n36:47.960 --> 36:49.960\nThat part doesn't make any sense to me.\n\n36:49.960 --> 36:52.960\nBut then, in one of the most egregious violations\n\n36:52.960 --> 36:54.960\nof my personal cinematic narrative rules,\n\n36:54.960 --> 36:57.960\nshe finds out she could have gone home any time\n\n36:57.960 --> 36:59.960\nby clicking her heels.\n\n36:59.960 --> 37:00.960\nAnd so she does.\n\n37:00.960 --> 37:01.960\nAnd then she wakes up and...\n\n37:01.960 --> 37:03.960\nDoes she wake up in black and white again?\n\n37:03.960 --> 37:04.960\nYes.\n\n37:04.960 --> 37:06.960\nThat's kind of a rip-off.\n\n37:06.960 --> 37:08.960\nBut I guess how are you going to...\n\n37:08.960 --> 37:11.960\nDo you remember what the Iron Man and the lion\n\n37:11.960 --> 37:13.960\nand Scarecrow were searching for?\n\n37:13.960 --> 37:14.960\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n37:14.960 --> 37:16.960\nThe each are...\n\n37:16.960 --> 37:18.960\nThe Cowardly Lion wants a heart.\n\n37:18.960 --> 37:20.960\nSo he has a song about wanting a heart.\n\n37:20.960 --> 37:22.960\nNo, Iron Man wants a heart.\n\n37:22.960 --> 37:23.960\nIron Man wants a heart.\n\n37:23.960 --> 37:24.960\nLet him talk.\n\n37:24.960 --> 37:25.960\nHe has an arc reactor.\n\n37:25.960 --> 37:28.960\nHe wants a heart.\n\n37:28.960 --> 37:31.960\nWait, okay.\n\n37:31.960 --> 37:33.960\nThank you very much.\n\n37:33.960 --> 37:34.960\nYou're right.\n\n37:34.960 --> 37:36.960\nOkay, so the Tin Man wants a heart.\n\n37:36.960 --> 37:37.960\nTin Man, yes.\n\n37:37.960 --> 37:38.960\nHe doesn't have a heart.\n\n37:38.960 --> 37:40.960\nI associate the heart with courage.\n\n37:40.960 --> 37:41.960\nWhat the fuck does the lion want?\n\n37:41.960 --> 37:42.960\nHe has a diploma.\n\n37:42.960 --> 37:44.960\nI just want class.\n\n37:44.960 --> 37:46.960\nHe literally gets a diploma at the end.\n\n37:46.960 --> 37:47.960\nRight?\n\n37:47.960 --> 37:48.960\nLion...\n\n37:48.960 --> 37:49.960\nIt's just courage.\n\n37:49.960 --> 37:50.960\nOr he gets a badge.\n\n37:50.960 --> 37:52.960\nWho gets the diploma?\n\n37:52.960 --> 37:53.960\nScarecrow.\n\n37:53.960 --> 37:56.960\nSloppy.\n\n37:56.960 --> 38:00.960\nSo heart is courage, is bravery, is passion.\n\n38:00.960 --> 38:01.960\nSo lump it together.\n\n38:01.960 --> 38:04.960\nMake one character out of three, represent those.\n\n38:04.960 --> 38:05.960\nSorry.\n\n38:05.960 --> 38:07.960\nBut the...\n\n38:07.960 --> 38:11.960\nAre you fixing a movie you haven't seen?\n\n38:11.960 --> 38:12.960\nThere's a reason I won't watch it.\n\n38:12.960 --> 38:14.960\nIt looks sloppy from a distance.\n\n38:14.960 --> 38:17.960\nThat should be a fucking segment every episode.\n\n38:17.960 --> 38:20.960\nDad fixes a movie he hasn't seen.\n\n38:20.960 --> 38:24.960\nWe'll go down the AFI 100.\n\n38:24.960 --> 38:25.960\nExactly.\n\n38:25.960 --> 38:32.960\nWhat's the major film that you haven't seen that you're embarrassed or that you're unrepentant\n\n38:32.960 --> 38:33.960\nabout not having seen?\n\n38:33.960 --> 38:36.960\nWell, I mean, Wizard of Oz is a big one.\n\n38:36.960 --> 38:38.960\nIt's a wonderful life.\n\n38:38.960 --> 38:39.960\nYeah, that's a good movie.\n\n38:39.960 --> 38:41.960\nBut it's so forced on you.\n\n38:41.960 --> 38:45.960\nIt took me until my mid-20s to start watching Woody Allen movies.\n\n38:45.960 --> 38:48.960\nBecause when I was growing up, it was like every stand-up would come out and go,\n\n38:48.960 --> 38:56.960\nand Woody Allen would go, and I didn't understand that he was an artist and that he was writing things.\n\n38:56.960 --> 39:01.960\nI also didn't understand that he was a guy that was a nerd that was putting himself in movies.\n\n39:01.960 --> 39:07.960\nI just thought that God made action figures that were famous and that this guy I was supposed\n\n39:07.960 --> 39:12.960\nto think was interesting because he had glasses and red hair.\n\n39:12.960 --> 39:14.960\nAnd then you had to shake that stuff.\n\n39:14.960 --> 39:18.960\nAnd those holiday movies, they're hard to swallow.\n\n39:18.960 --> 39:19.960\nIt's a wonderful life.\n\n39:19.960 --> 39:26.960\nYou have to really cut yourself off from the weight of it, of how everyone talks about it.\n\n39:26.960 --> 39:27.960\nBut it's a good...\n\n39:27.960 --> 39:28.960\nI like that movie.\n\n39:28.960 --> 39:29.960\nIt's a very small scene.\n\n39:29.960 --> 39:31.960\nBut this is before...\n\n39:31.960 --> 39:33.960\nI've seen big parts of it, I think.\n\n39:33.960 --> 39:34.960\nI mean, I know that...\n\n39:34.960 --> 39:39.960\nYeah, so the angel gets his wings when you ring the bell and Mr. Banks doesn't want the money\n\n39:39.960 --> 39:42.960\nin the potter in the whale chair.\n\n39:42.960 --> 39:45.960\nHe finds out that if he wasn't around...\n\n39:45.960 --> 39:46.960\nOh, yeah.\n\n39:46.960 --> 39:49.960\nThe potter needs a heart.\n\n39:49.960 --> 39:52.960\nIt sounds like its second act is a...\n\n39:52.960 --> 39:54.960\nIt sounds like I kind of...\n\n39:54.960 --> 39:56.960\nLike, kind of long.\n\n39:56.960 --> 39:57.960\nLike, okay, we get it.\n\n39:57.960 --> 39:58.960\nI love this segment.\n\n39:58.960 --> 40:00.960\nHow do you know how long is the second act?\n\n40:00.960 --> 40:02.960\nIt sounds like it's kind of long.\n\n40:02.960 --> 40:04.960\nBecause I've never heard...\n\n40:04.960 --> 40:10.960\nLike, throughout 41 years of living in a world that keeps referencing that movie,\n\n40:10.960 --> 40:19.960\nI've never heard anyone reference any structural flagstones that make a complete story.\n\n40:19.960 --> 40:24.960\nIt sounds like this guy's gonna kill himself and then an angel comes up and says,\n\n40:24.960 --> 40:25.960\nDon't kill yourself.\n\n40:25.960 --> 40:28.960\nWhy shouldn't I?\n\n40:28.960 --> 40:30.960\nI'll tell you why.\n\n40:30.960 --> 40:33.960\nBecause if you did, things would be worse.\n\n40:33.960 --> 40:35.960\nAnd he's like, I don't believe you.\n\n40:35.960 --> 40:40.960\nIt's just like one-third the Christmas Carol.\n\n40:40.960 --> 40:42.960\nAnd he takes him and he goes and shows him.\n\n40:42.960 --> 40:44.960\nHe goes like, look at this.\n\n40:44.960 --> 40:48.960\nAnd he's like, oh my god, I can't believe I'm dead and people noticed.\n\n40:48.960 --> 40:51.960\nExcept when we watch it now, Potterville is fucking awesome.\n\n40:51.960 --> 40:53.960\nLike, the Potterville is like...\n\n40:53.960 --> 40:57.960\nEveryone's just jitterbugging and there's this good music and it's like...\n\n40:57.960 --> 40:59.960\nYou'd rather hang out in Potterville.\n\n40:59.960 --> 41:01.960\nYou did ruin everything.\n\n41:01.960 --> 41:03.960\nBut I like the part...\n\n41:03.960 --> 41:05.960\nI don't know the movie very well.\n\n41:05.960 --> 41:08.960\nI've only seen it a couple of times over a long amount of years.\n\n41:08.960 --> 41:10.960\nPeople are gasping, by the way.\n\n41:10.960 --> 41:12.960\nHis house is all windy.\n\n41:12.960 --> 41:15.960\nThe house that he bought, that he got with his wife and they had a family.\n\n41:15.960 --> 41:17.960\nAnd the house is shitty and it's drafting.\n\n41:17.960 --> 41:19.960\nIt's falling apart and he's going broke.\n\n41:19.960 --> 41:21.960\nThere's a run on the band.\n\n41:21.960 --> 41:23.960\nAnd the little, what do you call it?\n\n41:23.960 --> 41:27.960\nA little ball, a little knoll thing or knob thing that comes off at the end of the stairwell.\n\n41:27.960 --> 41:30.960\nAnd he starts yelling and his daughter is sick.\n\n41:30.960 --> 41:33.960\nShe can knob off the stairwell. It just comes off.\n\n41:33.960 --> 41:35.960\nIt comes off when they first move in the house and it's charming.\n\n41:35.960 --> 41:37.960\nThe house is a fixer-upper.\n\n41:37.960 --> 41:40.960\nLike, this is a symbol that we have growing to do.\n\n41:40.960 --> 41:42.960\nThen it never changes.\n\n41:42.960 --> 41:44.960\nThe house just keeps being shitty and it's getting shittier.\n\n41:44.960 --> 41:48.960\nAnd now his daughter on Christmas Eve or whatever has a cough and she's sick\n\n41:48.960 --> 41:50.960\nbecause it's so fucking cold in the house.\n\n41:50.960 --> 41:51.960\nOh, Jesus.\n\n41:51.960 --> 41:52.960\nAnd he starts crying.\n\n41:52.960 --> 41:57.960\nSo while the angel is proving to him how bad life would be,\n\n41:57.960 --> 42:00.960\nhe's just getting angry at his family.\n\n42:00.960 --> 42:02.960\nI don't forget if he goes back at this point, I don't know, but at one point\n\n42:02.960 --> 42:04.960\nhe starts yelling at his family and he becomes like,\n\n42:04.960 --> 42:06.960\nhe's like, I didn't fucking ask for this shit.\n\n42:06.960 --> 42:08.960\nI don't fucking want to do this.\n\n42:08.960 --> 42:09.960\nI never wanted this.\n\n42:09.960 --> 42:10.960\nI always wanted to do something else.\n\n42:10.960 --> 42:12.960\nYou guys made me do this shit.\n\n42:12.960 --> 42:14.960\nLike, fuck you, fuck me, fuck everybody.\n\n42:14.960 --> 42:17.960\nAnd it's the symbol of that piece of furniture breaking\n\n42:17.960 --> 42:20.960\nand he raises his voice at his little sick daughter,\n\n42:20.960 --> 42:22.960\nZazu or whatever her name is.\n\n42:22.960 --> 42:23.960\nZazu, what's it?\n\n42:23.960 --> 42:24.960\nZuzu.\n\n42:24.960 --> 42:28.960\nAnd like that moment is like, shit gets really dark and he just implodes\n\n42:28.960 --> 42:30.960\nand that's when it starts to become not fake Capra.\n\n42:30.960 --> 42:32.960\nIt becomes really punk rock and dark.\n\n42:32.960 --> 42:36.960\nAnd then Capra puts this beautiful little bow on it at the end,\n\n42:36.960 --> 42:38.960\nwhich is like, it's good stuff.\n\n42:38.960 --> 42:40.960\nAlso, it's America that never existed.\n\n42:40.960 --> 42:42.960\nYou know, it's a fake America.\n\n42:42.960 --> 42:45.960\nOh, wasn't there something about a pharmacist that hit a kid so much\n\n42:45.960 --> 42:46.960\nhe was deaf or something?\n\n42:46.960 --> 42:47.960\nHe hit him.\n\n42:47.960 --> 42:48.960\nHe can't hear to one ear because he clapped him.\n\n42:48.960 --> 42:49.960\nOh, yeah, that's right.\n\n42:49.960 --> 42:53.960\nHe tried to save him from putting, like he was senile or drunk or whatever\n\n42:53.960 --> 42:54.960\nand he was going to poison an old lady.\n\n42:54.960 --> 42:55.960\nOh, yeah.\n\n42:55.960 --> 42:57.960\nAnd so he smashes him over the ear and he can't hear.\n\n42:57.960 --> 42:59.960\nHe has a bad ear because of that.\n\n42:59.960 --> 43:01.960\nIsn't there also a part where they like propose\n\n43:01.960 --> 43:04.960\nand there's like a fake moon out the window that they put up?\n\n43:04.960 --> 43:05.960\nDo you remember that?\n\n43:05.960 --> 43:06.960\nIs that right?\n\n43:06.960 --> 43:07.960\nRight?\n\n43:07.960 --> 43:08.960\nThey propose.\n\n43:08.960 --> 43:09.960\nI remember.\n\n43:09.960 --> 43:13.960\nSo you guys as experts in this movie,\n\n43:13.960 --> 43:16.960\nwe've all experienced the same amount of cinema.\n\n43:16.960 --> 43:17.960\nThat's my point.\n\n43:17.960 --> 43:22.960\nNo, that movie moved me and touched me.\n\n43:22.960 --> 43:23.960\nProve it.\n\n43:23.960 --> 43:27.960\nProve it with a rap.\n\n43:27.960 --> 43:28.960\nAll right.\n\n43:28.960 --> 43:29.960\nNo.\n\n43:29.960 --> 43:32.960\nBy the way, speaking of, can I say, I told you this,\n\n43:32.960 --> 43:40.960\nthat Dean Pelton rap is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my entire life.\n\n43:40.960 --> 43:41.960\nI watched it.\n\n43:41.960 --> 43:43.960\nI swear at least 30 times.\n\n43:43.960 --> 43:45.960\nIt's so funny.\n\n43:45.960 --> 43:46.960\nIt's so good.\n\n43:46.960 --> 43:49.960\nThe first time I watched it, I didn't even laugh.\n\n43:49.960 --> 43:51.960\nI just didn't breathe for a while.\n\n43:51.960 --> 43:53.960\nIt's so great.\n\n43:53.960 --> 43:54.960\nYeah.\n\n43:54.960 --> 43:59.960\nSomebody online tempoed it and put it under a beat\n\n43:59.960 --> 44:00.960\nand it's amazing.\n\n44:00.960 --> 44:05.960\nAaron played it for me.\n\n44:05.960 --> 44:10.960\nDon Diego and I wrote the lyrics overnight.\n\n44:10.960 --> 44:13.960\nDon Diego, you have a Spanish gentleman working for you?\n\n44:13.960 --> 44:18.960\nIs that just like your imaginary friend who does rewrites with you?\n\n44:18.960 --> 44:19.960\nHello, Dan.\n\n44:19.960 --> 44:21.960\nI'm not alone.\n\n44:21.960 --> 44:23.960\nDon Diego is here.\n\n44:23.960 --> 44:28.960\nWere you asleep at your writing office at night and a figure emerged in the balcony?\n\n44:28.960 --> 44:31.960\nHe definitely, we always tease him about that.\n\n44:31.960 --> 44:37.960\nYeah, it's just Dan with a rose in his ear.\n\n44:37.960 --> 44:43.960\nBut he kind of spat out a bunch of stuff and in the original thing that he threw out,\n\n44:43.960 --> 44:47.960\nit included the whole ending, which is that I didn't want to change.\n\n44:47.960 --> 44:51.960\nIt's just like, Barack Obama is scared of me.\n\n44:51.960 --> 44:55.960\nAnd I was like, okay, we're going to keep that.\n\n44:55.960 --> 44:57.960\nBut then we sat and it kind of nitpicked.\n\n44:57.960 --> 45:01.960\nAnd then when I heard it set to the beat, it was like, oh, that's a good rap.\n\n45:01.960 --> 45:04.960\nYeah, well, yeah, it's a funny joke.\n\n45:04.960 --> 45:05.960\nIt's great.\n\n45:05.960 --> 45:07.960\nI love it as much as everybody.\n\n45:07.960 --> 45:09.960\nI just love how quickly it goes south.\n\n45:09.960 --> 45:12.960\nHe gets two lines out and then it's like, what the fuck is wrong?\n\n45:12.960 --> 45:14.960\nBecause he wants to do a freestyle rap.\n\n45:14.960 --> 45:17.960\nHe's got that character so much because he's like a children's book character.\n\n45:17.960 --> 45:24.960\nTo me, that's like the other high point of him is when he comes in and he's a half man, half woman,\n\n45:24.960 --> 45:26.960\nbecause he wants to say that.\n\n45:26.960 --> 45:29.960\nAnd then he has this breakdown and goes, what am I doing?\n\n45:29.960 --> 45:33.960\nAnd it's like, I've got to fucking cool it and he runs out.\n\n45:33.960 --> 45:36.960\nAnd then he comes back at the end of the episode and goes, you know what?\n\n45:36.960 --> 45:40.960\nI thought about it and I had lunch with people who are interested in what makes me tick.\n\n45:40.960 --> 45:42.960\nAnd I had the best day of my life.\n\n45:42.960 --> 45:44.960\nHe's like the pokey little puppy.\n\n45:44.960 --> 45:49.960\nHe's so simultaneously like he represents.\n\n45:49.960 --> 45:58.960\nWe equate complexity with the opposite of innocence too much.\n\n45:58.960 --> 46:05.960\nWe think that innocence means purity and it doesn't.\n\n46:05.960 --> 46:14.960\nYou could be the most complicated, most sexual, most labyrinthine person in the world\n\n46:14.960 --> 46:16.960\nand you could still be innocent.\n\n46:16.960 --> 46:20.960\nYou don't have to be a cotton ball that just has no substance to it.\n\n46:20.960 --> 46:23.960\nWe think like, oh, that won't hurt you.\n\n46:23.960 --> 46:24.960\nThat's what innocence means.\n\n46:24.960 --> 46:29.960\nNo, innocence means there's nothing that can hurt you here.\n\n46:29.960 --> 46:31.960\nThis person wouldn't hurt you.\n\n46:31.960 --> 46:37.960\nHe has a river that runs leagues deep underneath him, but he's innocent.\n\n46:37.960 --> 46:39.960\nAnd so he stumbles into these situations.\n\n46:39.960 --> 46:44.960\nAnd he's like, I'm going to do a freestyle rap because you're late.\n\n46:44.960 --> 46:50.960\nI can't pay you this week so I'm going to do this freestyle rap where you don't know what you're going to say next.\n\n46:50.960 --> 46:56.960\nAnd he starts rapping and he stumbles into the spirit of the street overtakes him\n\n46:56.960 --> 47:02.960\nand becomes a vessel for black anger and disenfranchised youth\n\n47:02.960 --> 47:09.960\nand has to run out of the room dressed as a peanut blocker.\n\n47:09.960 --> 47:15.960\nIt really is the best show ever on TV.\n\n47:15.960 --> 47:19.960\nWell, at least that moment anyway.\n\n47:19.960 --> 47:25.960\nWe all feel the same way in the writers room.\n\n47:25.960 --> 47:34.960\nAnd Jim Rash needs 50 takes of that because I kept being like, well, yeah,\n\n47:34.960 --> 47:37.960\nbut the camera needs to be on you enough time.\n\n47:37.960 --> 47:40.960\nIs he doing that rap even when it's not his coverage?\n\n47:40.960 --> 47:42.960\nWas he giving it his all?\n\n47:42.960 --> 47:44.960\nYeah, he is.\n\n47:44.960 --> 47:49.960\nBut also the point of the rap is that it escalates and escalates and escalates until he's screaming.\n\n47:49.960 --> 47:53.960\nAnd so he's doing different takes from different angles.\n\n47:53.960 --> 47:58.960\nThere are two moments when I've almost killed a man on that set.\n\n47:58.960 --> 48:04.960\nThat's one and the other one is when Leonard, Richard Urban, the guy who plays Leonard,\n\n48:04.960 --> 48:11.960\nhis first episode in season one, he was in a pool and he's treading water.\n\n48:11.960 --> 48:17.960\nYou go through central casting and you order people off a menu.\n\n48:17.960 --> 48:20.960\nYou go, I need an old guy that can swim.\n\n48:20.960 --> 48:27.960\nAnd you get Richard Erdman who was in Gunsmoke and had his own show and was on Sid Caesar.\n\n48:27.960 --> 48:29.960\nAnd you go to his IMDB page.\n\n48:29.960 --> 48:34.960\nSo sometime afterward and realize I've been physically abusing television history.\n\n48:34.960 --> 48:40.960\nBut in the meantime, I got an old guy that can swim and he's swimming.\n\n48:40.960 --> 48:44.960\nAnd I guess like his first, he's just supposed to be treading water in a pool\n\n48:44.960 --> 48:48.960\nand Jeff Winger said something and then he goes like,\n\n48:48.960 --> 48:51.960\nwell, he's just busted, but what was it?\n\n48:51.960 --> 48:54.960\nJeff goes like, we're all crazy, not me.\n\n48:54.960 --> 48:56.960\nAnd then Jeff says, shut up Leonard.\n\n48:56.960 --> 48:58.960\nAnd there's like this random character, shut up Leonard.\n\n48:58.960 --> 49:00.960\nI saw your art project, whatever.\n\n49:00.960 --> 49:02.960\nAnd he goes like, busted.\n\n49:02.960 --> 49:04.960\nAnd then he swims away.\n\n49:04.960 --> 49:08.960\nWe're shooting coverage of Leonard and he's just an old guy that can swim\n\n49:08.960 --> 49:10.960\nand we're just making him swim forever.\n\n49:10.960 --> 49:13.960\nAnd I'm just like, he's not saying busted right.\n\n49:13.960 --> 49:15.960\nThere's just like another take, another take.\n\n49:15.960 --> 49:20.960\nI went to the bathroom early on before I came back and like we did like 50 more takes\n\n49:20.960 --> 49:25.960\nand then eventually like Joe Russo, the director, said like, he's going to drown.\n\n49:25.960 --> 49:31.960\nAnd I think he got it while you were in the bathroom like on take one.\n\n49:31.960 --> 49:35.960\nAnd I think that he's, you've been drowning an old man for no reason,\n\n49:35.960 --> 49:37.960\nfor no reason the entire time.\n\n49:37.960 --> 49:44.960\nI think you're like an Egyptian pharaoh in a Mel Gibson movie about just the end of civilization.\n\n49:44.960 --> 49:48.960\nBut you know, once he drowns, nobody fucks up a take after that.\n\n49:48.960 --> 49:51.960\nI look at the rest of the pool and I go, you see that?\n\n49:51.960 --> 49:53.960\nYeah, say busted right.\n\n49:53.960 --> 49:55.960\nYou see what Kraft gets you?\n\n49:57.960 --> 49:59.960\nYou follow direction.\n\n49:59.960 --> 50:03.960\nAnd so it turned out absolutely he nailed it on the first take.\n\n50:03.960 --> 50:08.960\nAnd the rest of the 50 takes, he was just inhaling too much water to get his line right.\n\n50:08.960 --> 50:12.960\nHe's an old man who can swim.\n\n50:12.960 --> 50:15.960\nSo, yeah, that's how I met Leonard.\n\n50:15.960 --> 50:17.960\nI was killing him.\n\n50:17.960 --> 50:20.960\nAnd that's the second time I saw him like because we brought him back.\n\n50:20.960 --> 50:23.960\nAnd I was like, so there was like Jeff.\n\n50:23.960 --> 50:25.960\nThis time you're bungee jumping for this thing.\n\n50:25.960 --> 50:28.960\nThey're supposed to just walk by him and he's supposed to go like,\n\n50:28.960 --> 50:31.960\nlike Professor Slater says a zinger to Jeff.\n\n50:31.960 --> 50:35.960\nAnd then it's supposed to just land on Leonard going, ooh.\n\n50:35.960 --> 50:39.960\nAnd he's just, he's just there and he's like, they keep going past him and he keeps going,\n\n50:39.960 --> 50:42.960\noh.\n\n50:42.960 --> 50:44.960\nOr, oh.\n\n50:44.960 --> 50:45.960\nOr, yeah.\n\n50:45.960 --> 50:47.960\nEverything but who.\n\n50:47.960 --> 50:48.960\nAnd I go up to him.\n\n50:48.960 --> 50:49.960\nHe doesn't know who I am.\n\n50:49.960 --> 50:54.960\nLike he says, I just go, hey, Richard, hey, I'm a kid kid kid.\n\n50:54.960 --> 50:57.960\nLet us next take a, just go like, who.\n\n50:57.960 --> 51:00.960\nAnd he goes, pfft.\n\n51:00.960 --> 51:03.960\nHe just looked at me and just like, like, fuck you.\n\n51:03.960 --> 51:06.960\nYou know, I got from all of that like fuck you.\n\n51:06.960 --> 51:13.460\nI didn't know at the time still that he was I just I just I just what I got was\n\n51:13.460 --> 51:19.460\nfuck you and I was like I think I think he might have known that but not that I\n\n51:19.460 --> 51:23.780\ncreated the show I think I think you so that's my worders me that's the worst\n\n51:23.780 --> 51:29.780\nfraction of information at all I know that faced from one place which is my\n\n51:29.780 --> 51:35.060\ndeath I don't know but but then you know anyways who cares great scene yeah\n\n51:35.060 --> 51:39.640\npeanut peanut bar rap thanks this is the place where you laugh at the peanut\n\n51:39.640 --> 51:45.460\nbar rap watch community on Thursdays and NBC then tune in to Dan Hyman's\n\n51:45.460 --> 51:52.000\npodcast to laugh at the peanut bar rap behind the scenes of the peanut bar rap\n\n51:52.000 --> 52:00.400\nall right so I think that I think that I didn't talk to him about it I got out\n\n52:00.400 --> 52:05.860\nof my car as he dropped me off at my house last time I saw him on Friday and\n\n52:05.860 --> 52:15.420\nI said see you Sunday and he said I think he said yes and I literally haven't\n\n52:15.420 --> 52:20.220\ntalked to him since was he in the green room who is he I've no idea who you're\n\n52:20.220 --> 52:43.340\ntalking about is Spencer back I guess it was just\n\n52:43.340 --> 52:57.060\nI wasn't even thinking about the fact that since we last saw you you were on\n\n52:57.060 --> 53:06.900\ncommunity and yeah yeah I was has there still I asked you this already but I\n\n53:06.900 --> 53:11.540\nhaven't seen you in a couple days has there been any negative I'm very I this\n\n53:11.540 --> 53:16.700\nis what I keep racing myself for like I don't want you to be abraded and flapped\n\n53:16.700 --> 53:23.420\nyou're unflappable I don't need to be flapped by being on the show yeah in the\n\n53:23.420 --> 53:29.220\nEast Coast viewing there was some some people talking shit about me but it was\n\n53:29.220 --> 53:37.020\ncool because they they were right and they just had shitty weather they did\n\n53:37.020 --> 53:41.580\nno they were lame they're being what was their beef I don't know they called me\n\n53:41.580 --> 53:49.180\nbeardy McGee that's that's accurate and flatter and I don't know I wouldn't say\n\n53:49.180 --> 53:54.660\nso you know you don't like the Irish connotation in that or he is wearing\n\n53:54.660 --> 54:01.860\ngreen yeah I'm very strongly anti-Irish my voice is so anti-Irish you're\n\n54:01.860 --> 54:05.820\nwearing green the night before St. Patrick's yeah because I've that's why\n\n54:05.820 --> 54:09.780\nI'm anti-Irish because I was always attacked in school for not fucking\n\n54:09.780 --> 54:13.420\nwearing green because apparently it's okay to touch other people without their\n\n54:13.420 --> 54:19.940\npermission you get you get pinched or punched yeah just constantly and half the\n\n54:19.940 --> 54:23.980\ntime I'd be wearing green it's like where do you get off apparently on touch\n\n54:23.980 --> 54:29.060\nand other people without their permission maybe that was their way of\n\n54:29.060 --> 54:32.900\ngetting a little piece of you with like kind of surreptitiously like I want to\n\n54:32.900 --> 54:36.540\ntouch him this is the only angle I have I bet there were like 50 people last week\n\n54:36.540 --> 54:41.020\nbeing like oh I pinched that guy they probably were yeah no I was actually\n\n54:41.020 --> 54:43.900\nget you get you there's a tradition about getting pinched if you don't yeah if\n\n54:43.900 --> 54:50.500\nyou don't work green on you not oh my god I'm so envious yeah seriously just\n\n54:50.500 --> 54:55.460\ntortured in school my angle was always I have green eyes and if that didn't work\n\n54:55.460 --> 54:59.260\nI said I'm wearing green green underwear and I play on their homophobia I would\n\n54:59.260 --> 55:03.860\nwear green underwear like half the time not on purpose they just all always had\n\n55:03.860 --> 55:11.140\nit doesn't it's white when you put it on you should go to the doctor\n\n55:11.140 --> 55:18.340\nwe should we should we should we should we should just hang out Spencer are you\n\n55:18.340 --> 55:23.740\nexcited about all the the stuff from the episode yeah so there's too much to\n\n55:23.740 --> 55:28.820\ntalk to you about you you're in this in this TV show who cares so somebody call\n\n55:28.820 --> 55:35.620\nyou beardy McGee so then we went to Austin we we premiered this movie that if\n\n55:35.620 --> 55:38.820\nit's not accurate to call you the star of the movie it's certainly accurate to\n\n55:38.820 --> 55:45.500\ncall you the the hero of the movie so what what anything changed from that any\n\n55:45.500 --> 55:50.740\ndense in your Spencer knows no I don't know it was weird seeing that movie I\n\n55:50.740 --> 55:57.460\nhad such a short beard back then no one called you beardy McGee no no\n\n55:57.460 --> 56:03.980\ncertainly not beardy or work at least just a work but no it was it was really\n\n56:03.980 --> 56:08.100\ngood seeing me on the movie it was really I was a lot more comfortable seeing\n\n56:08.100 --> 56:12.300\nmyself in the movie than on TV I don't know seeing myself on TV I was like no\n\n56:12.300 --> 56:16.580\nthis is wrong everything about this is wasn't you playing someone else rather\n\n56:16.580 --> 56:20.500\nthan being yourself was that the probably had something to do with it yeah\n\n56:20.500 --> 56:26.180\nyeah that makes sense yeah I mean weird you guys none of us belong on TV TV is\n\n56:26.180 --> 56:32.300\na crazy place for crazy people like we those people are are crazy but but I\n\n56:32.300 --> 56:36.020\nwrote a character for you that's like oh this guy's crazy you shouldn't feel out\n\n56:36.020 --> 56:40.420\nof place should feel fine so that you were protected yeah I felt protected by\n\n56:40.420 --> 56:44.700\nthat role definitely but the movie on the heels of the movie did anybody did I\n\n56:44.700 --> 56:47.980\ndon't know nothing nothing's nothing's really changed for me everything's\n\n56:47.980 --> 56:53.540\nchanged because I don't know how much of this you knew but I for the entire time\n\n56:53.540 --> 56:57.500\nthat movie like there was a certain point where I was just living in grief I\n\n56:57.500 --> 57:02.900\nwas just multitasking a specific amount of my brain and my stomach for fucking\n\n57:02.900 --> 57:08.940\ngrief because I was seeing cuts of the movie and I was like my life goes up\n\n57:08.940 --> 57:13.820\nand down goes I make a rape joke I don't make a rape joke I make a Rick and\n\n57:13.820 --> 57:18.940\nMorty I don't make a Rick and Morty I I'm constantly obsessed with how people\n\n57:18.940 --> 57:23.380\nthink about me but I don't want to ever be dishonest I'm a narcissist but I'm\n\n57:23.380 --> 57:30.180\nhonest about that blue bitty blue bitty blue I made this movie I'm in it and I'm\n\n57:30.180 --> 57:36.060\nwatching cuts of it and I'm like there were dark dark dark days and I don't know\n\n57:36.060 --> 57:39.700\nhow much of that you were experiencing if you were ever wondering what the fuck\n\n57:39.700 --> 57:44.620\nis this cloud is this ever gonna come over were you ever wondering how am I\n\n57:44.620 --> 57:49.900\ngonna be portrayed in this movie because you never saw anything of it I I just\n\n57:49.900 --> 57:55.220\ntried not to think about it I mean it wasn't about me like it was about you\n\n57:55.220 --> 58:01.020\nand who you are so I wasn't worried that I'd you know be a weird part of it or\n\n58:01.020 --> 58:05.420\nsome part of it that I wouldn't expect I thought that what I was in was pretty\n\n58:05.420 --> 58:10.340\npretty good and I came off as a really good guy but I didn't expect to be in it\n\n58:10.340 --> 58:13.820\nI probably didn't even expect to be in it as much as I was so I wasn't really\n\n58:13.820 --> 58:17.020\nworried about it had to be about you at a certain point it was Aaron's idea\n\n58:17.020 --> 58:22.220\nreally to I remember at the pit of my despair going I'm gonna fucking kill\n\n58:22.220 --> 58:28.340\nmyself like I this movie is the nail in my self-destructive cough and I finally\n\n58:28.340 --> 58:32.500\nfigured out a way to make everyone hate me because I don't change there's\n\n58:32.500 --> 58:37.420\nnothing redeemable about me etc etc and I was venting all this to Aaron and\n\n58:37.420 --> 58:42.660\nAaron said just tell Neil because I don't have any control over the editorial\n\n58:42.660 --> 58:47.220\ncontent but she was like just tell Neil who's struggling for a story in this\n\n58:47.220 --> 58:51.740\nmovie just tell him to make it about Spencer tell tell him that the story is\n\n58:51.740 --> 58:57.300\nSpencer and leave you alone like like let you be let you be the asshole that\n\n58:57.300 --> 59:02.020\nyou are or the non-asshole that you are let you just be Dan Harmon in the\n\n59:02.020 --> 59:06.420\nbackground as the bedrock of the whole thing and let anybody that goes through\n\n59:06.420 --> 59:10.660\nanything be the young guy that everybody likes that is undeniably going on a\n\n59:10.660 --> 59:14.100\nlittle journey and that was the to me that was the turning point of this thing\n\n59:14.100 --> 59:19.260\nnot making me almost kill myself because I did call Neil and give him Aaron's\n\n59:19.260 --> 59:24.100\nnote and the next cut I saw it was like holy shit this is gonna work I'm gonna\n\n59:24.100 --> 59:31.220\nget away with this and so we premiered it at South by Southwest and it people\n\n59:31.220 --> 59:35.420\nlike it and the reviews are good and stuff like I'm yeah we should see that I\n\n59:35.420 --> 59:37.860\nread the reviews it really good I don't want to read too much because I don't\n\n59:37.860 --> 59:41.220\nreally have a sense of what the movie is like but you guys like how it turned\n\n59:41.220 --> 59:45.180\nout yeah yeah it's almost like the equivalent it's like it's weird like\n\n59:45.180 --> 59:51.620\nit's like you go into a dark bar and just like like it's not I yeah I don't\n\n59:51.620 --> 59:55.500\nknow what the fuck it is it's a it's it's it's got details I don't know if\n\n59:55.500 --> 59:59.700\nthere are all the details that everybody wants for or needs at any given time but\n\n59:59.700 --> 01:00:03.980\nI for me like we like Spencer is like kind of the emergent hero in it but for\n\n01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:11.060\nme the movie is it's ostensibly about Dan and why the eternal question why are\n\n01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:14.460\nwe doing this why are we going out on tour why are we making this movie the\n\n01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:19.100\nguy gets fired from the show so he goes on the road and they kept asking me in\n\n01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:22.780\ninterviews like why are we doing this I don't know what we're doing I just think\n\n01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:26.420\nit's gonna be fun and then Spencer kind of goes through an actual journey but\n\n01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:30.460\nfor me the movie is about you guys it's about the fans that come to the show\n\n01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:36.220\nbecause this is everybody is an individual but it comes together as this\n\n01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.580\nkind of awesome organism of people and that there's this straight-to-camera\n\n01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:45.020\ninterviews with with the harmonians and I've seen three cuts of it and I cry\n\n01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:48.860\nevery time it's like it's not like like boohoo but like it's just like some\n\n01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:53.980\nreally beautiful kind of human moments in there like I think it's more about the\n\n01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:58.060\npeople that come then about anybody up on the stage yeah they call that the\n\n01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:10.580\nmoney shot no it's it's the I was doing a pun come joke the capillaries in your\n\n01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:20.620\ncheeks dilate when fans are looking into the camera real let's let's let's get\n\n01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:34.260\nairy McGathey out here\n\n01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:39.860\nhello did you like the movie on I did like the movie I'm gonna steal a line\n\n01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:45.260\nfrom a review it's a movie about finding your people so I think for that\n\n01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:50.660\nreason it's it's it's great it doesn't what it's about to do it does I look I\n\n01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:56.020\nlook like a real bummer in it that's great but that's not really true no you\n\n01:01:56.020 --> 01:02:03.060\njust don't look like the genius and and and muse and like like person that's\n\n01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:07.220\nfunnier than me and the documentary should be about like which is the truth\n\n01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:12.660\nwell I thank you for your flattery when you when you focus the camera on me my\n\n01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:16.860\ngirlfriend becomes a person pushing a shopping cart and at various points I\n\n01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:22.260\ntake a shit on her to be funny and so it's not an accurate portrayal of our\n\n01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:25.180\nrelationship but it is an accurate portrayal of what an asshole boyfriend I\n\n01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:28.620\nam gonna take what you're saying all the way to the bank and tell you guys that\n\n01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:37.900\nthey cut out me figuring out almost the way to cure cancer and almost at one\n\n01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:42.060\npoint there were all these people in a soup line and I stood in front of them\n\n01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:45.860\nand I started delivering this like comedic speech and they all they all\n\n01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:51.660\nsuddenly were full they went and got job yeah there's hundreds and hundreds of\n\n01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:55.820\nhours of I mean it's 600 hours of footage there's a point there I saw cuts\n\n01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:58.780\nwhere all of a sudden you're just following Jeff like around the city\n\n01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:02.940\nand he's alone and he suddenly explains why he always every time the bus stops\n\n01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:08.420\nbreaks off and goes to be by himself and reads a book and they start talking\n\n01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:12.900\nabout his mother and you know that's all gone Jeff's just a guy in a suit in the\n\n01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.860\nmovie Jeff I wanted to tell you this last week I took a trip by myself to\n\n01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:21.860\nPalm Springs and I really was trying to channel you when I was walking out in\n\n01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:26.140\nthe city I took with me a book and I went to a Mexican restaurant and I'm like\n\n01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:31.420\nI'm just like Jeff Davis is gonna read this book I got salsa all over my book\n\n01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:35.100\nthat doesn't surprise me a bit because I've seen you around salsa we were in\n\n01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:40.420\nSan Francisco a couple years ago and I've seen you're on salsa as a great name\n\n01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:45.300\nfor this episode we called Aaron the salsa monster because there was a salsa\n\n01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:49.220\nbar in the mission at this burrito place or we were all dead we were just\n\n01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:53.220\ndrinking all day long it was the fight the last day of our trip we extended our\n\n01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:56.500\nstay another day we all went to we all got drunk and high I went to this\n\n01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:02.060\nburrito place and there was a salsa bar was not use a little small plastic\n\n01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:05.540\nramekins they give you to put salsa this one had like kind of like like\n\n01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:09.740\nquarter-pound like tubs like like big ones that you could like like you get\n\n01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:13.660\nolives that like in like a gelson or something like that and that you kept\n\n01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:17.020\ngoing to the bar and getting more setting children like that's not an\n\n01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:20.180\nexaggeration children that were near the bar going back I gotta get more salsa\n\n01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:23.580\nbecause she was out of salsa the reason why you're out of salsa is because none\n\n01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:27.940\nof it was in your mouth or on the food it was on the floor in your lap on my\n\n01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:35.100\nshoe on the table I was like maybe you maybe you don't actually like the end\n\n01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:38.900\nof my Palm Springs Jeff Davis trip was that like I got salsa all over my book\n\n01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:43.900\nand I had had two margaritas and I I went back to my car and I took a two-hour\n\n01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:48.500\nnap in my car on the street in Palm Springs exactly like a vision quest\n\n01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:53.620\nwhere I was gonna find myself and I found myself drunk in a car so what were\n\n01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:58.540\nyou hoping that what happened if you if you successfully channeled me that like\n\n01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:02.660\nyeah well that's a good question what what what does happen to Jeff in those\n\n01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:10.700\nmoments do you go and rejoin the adjustment bureau and your friends\n\n01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:15.900\nbetween dimensions really quick

01:23:19.580\nreleased from skeleton bondage and finding the Marsh Minotaur our heroes\n\n01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:25.180\nbegan to plot their escape together with the Minotaur's aid the gang trekked\n\n01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:30.860\nback to the hole from which they fell and using his teleportation cape Sharpie\n\n01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:37.180\nquickly found himself topside the rest of the adventurers weren't so lucky and\n\n01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:42.700\nand found they had to climb up Meredith the Minotaur's crazy ridiculous ladder\n\n01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:49.300\nas they ascended they were beset by their greatest fears boomers long-term\n\n01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:54.860\nrelationships and not having the appropriate crafts more rain fell from\n\n01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:59.620\nthe ladder in terror but eventually the gang faced their fears and climbed to\n\n01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:04.380\nfreedom and then they all gathered around a fire while Sharpie sang an old\n\n01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:09.700\ndwarven spiritual but what would they do now in the harsh unforgiving frozen\n\n01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:15.340\nwastelands of the north and one of their skull

tell it's not a bit no it's not a bit\n\n01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:54.820\nit may but it does look like a condo development how high off the ground is\n\n01:33:54.820 --> 01:34:05.540\nit you know I can do it in wing flaps it's like 28 I don't even know like 28\n\n01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:12.300\nhundred a wing flaps what is that what is that even translated to Spencer how\n\n01:34:12.300 -->

temperature\n\n01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:32.100\nnormally is for a hawk it's probably not freezing so it's not crazy higher is\n\n01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:38.740\nor he's nuts because he's crazy high or there was a there was a headwind or\n\n01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:43.620\nthere's a hand have you ever flown I mean did you know anything about it no how\n\n01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:46.740\nmany flaps do you think it but I would say all right if you want a number I\n\n01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:52.540\nwould say it's about 200 my hawk has lost it we got a we got a just\n\n01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:56.980\ntraipse across this fucking tundra until we either die or come to a place where\n\n01:34:56.980 --> 01:35:03.420\nsomebody can help us get find paradise yeah what a terrible Cocoa nearby\n\n01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:12.220\nCocoa's here that's how I call her now I jump on Cocoa when I and I ride off\n\n01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:20.700\ntrying to scout alright you know in what direction all all so just like a\n\n01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:27.140\nrapid slowly increasing circle like a spiral seems inefficient but go for it\n\n01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:32.580\nthere she is oh there she is there she is\n\n01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:40.900\noh there she is a little further now uh-huh away much farther each time away\n\n01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:47.700\nfrom the hole mm-hmm it's my the way I live my life away from the hole towards\n\n01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:56.140\nlike think about it the like the place where the we're where I would think the\n\n01:35:56.140 --> 01:36:03.780\nmost tarragon would be maybe like the greenest north northeast northeast you\n\n01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:10.900\nhead northeast for some time you don't really see anything until until you

yourself if they don't like you then they shouldn't have been\n\n01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:44.060\nyour friends in the first place I don't think Adam needs to be told to be true to\n\n01:36:44.060 -->
