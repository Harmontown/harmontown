00:00.000 --> 00:29.960
Hello, everybody, welcome to Meltdown Conference in Hollywood, California.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.960
Welcome to the Nerdmelt Theater.

00:31.960 --> 00:44.960
Harmontown is now in session.

00:44.960 --> 00:54.960
Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.960
Thank you.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.960
Welcome, welcome back.

00:58.960 --> 01:00.960
So we're in Austin.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.960
I have a little, I have a little cold, nothing contagious.

01:03.960 --> 01:09.960
It's just, you know, everyone that has a cold is an expert at that.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.960
Definitely not going to get you sick.

01:11.960 --> 01:17.960
I'm just, if you're wondering why I sound a little more like Willie Nelson or David Duchovny.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.960
Now you know why.

01:19.960 --> 01:20.960
I'm looking at my phone.

01:20.960 --> 01:22.960
I'm looking at what the shit we got to get through.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.960
Because we got all kinds of friends coming to talk to us.

01:24.960 --> 01:29.960
We're going to do the Southwest South, Southwest South.

01:29.960 --> 01:33.960
The South by Southwest breakdown with our friend, Kumail, who we didn't get to see out there.

01:33.960 --> 01:40.960
But I want to bring him out as soon as possible and just kind of download with him about Austin.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.960
Kumail's photo was everywhere.

01:42.960 --> 01:43.960
Yeah.

01:43.960 --> 01:46.960
On the back of the pedicabs, little bicycle, Rickshaw thingies.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.960
You could not move a muscle without seeing Kumail's gorgeous little face everywhere.

01:50.960 --> 01:51.960
Because he's in this HBO thing.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.960
They're promoting the hell out of it down there.

01:53.960 --> 01:54.960
Holy smoke.

01:54.960 --> 01:55.960
It was Orwellian.

01:55.960 --> 01:56.960
Did the community ever get there?

01:56.960 --> 02:00.960
At the exact place where you're taking off your shoes and having your ass searched by the TSA.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.960
Kumail, not Johnny's head.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.960
Staring over you in Austin.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.960
Casting a rye glance at you as you were.

02:07.960 --> 02:13.960
But before we get there, we don't want to torture him by talking about that while he's in the wings.

02:13.960 --> 02:18.960
But I just wanted to, you know, here's our pop culture minute.

02:18.960 --> 02:26.960
Pop culture minute.

02:26.960 --> 02:32.960
Well, there's some things that everyone is talking about, but they're not of any actual import.

02:32.960 --> 02:37.960
But everybody's talking about that because we live in a hive mind.

02:37.960 --> 02:42.960
All right.

02:42.960 --> 02:50.960
So this hive mind thing and its relationship with our individual lives and also the things that actually are important,

02:50.960 --> 02:54.960
kind of intersect with this concept today.

02:54.960 --> 03:01.960
This news that I woke to this morning on Twitter that Fred Phelps, the West Baptist Church fellow,

03:01.960 --> 03:07.960
who's just famous for its God hates bag slogan, that he's on his death bed.

03:07.960 --> 03:11.960
The reason we get that news is because his son said something on Facebook.

03:11.960 --> 03:19.960
In the same Facebook message, his son threw out the idea that Fred Phelps had been excommunicated

03:19.960 --> 03:25.960
from the West Baptist Church, for Westboro Baptist Church, for a year or more.

03:25.960 --> 03:31.960
I started doing like a little Nancy Drew, Googling, because I was like, what do you mean he was excommunicated?

03:31.960 --> 03:36.960
And I once, you know, I should care about more important things.

03:36.960 --> 03:40.960
I should be Googling how to give Africa clean water.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.960
And figuring it out. But instead I spent a good 40 minutes today going like,

03:45.960 --> 03:50.960
well, when did Fred Phelps get excommunicated? What does that mean?

03:50.960 --> 03:55.960
So it's really interesting to me.

03:55.960 --> 04:02.960
There's a lot of straight gay advocates on Twitter today and I'm not taking anything away from them.

04:02.960 --> 04:07.960
I'm not going to high road people who are high roading people.

04:07.960 --> 04:15.960
This is a great chance for everybody to spike a football on the grave of an absolutely unrepentant homophobe.

04:15.960 --> 04:23.960
Somebody who's the lightning rod for everything that we say is the reason why we need to be progressive,

04:23.960 --> 04:26.960
like the whole idea.

04:26.960 --> 04:30.960
And then you start peeling back the layers and you go, well, why was this guy famous?

04:30.960 --> 04:38.960
I started reading blogs by, you know, advocates and, you know, gay bloggers.

04:38.960 --> 04:44.960
I thought that would be funnier than it was.

04:44.960 --> 04:57.960
Like this sort of spirit rose through the lard that was like, okay, let's do what this guy didn't do.

04:57.960 --> 05:02.960
Let's not pick at his funeral. Let's not, let's not, let's look at this guy for what he was.

05:02.960 --> 05:07.960
He was a crazy old man. He had a congregation of about 11.

05:07.960 --> 05:15.960
And I think the reason why he was famous is because we all have this sort of impulse in our minds to protect ourselves and each other.

05:15.960 --> 05:22.960
And it's like, and where has he been since this excommunication?

05:22.960 --> 05:27.960
This is the point where I'll invite anybody who knows more about this than I do.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.960
I just want to dump what I know on the table so that you're not coming up for no reason.

05:31.960 --> 05:43.960
But was he excommunicated possibly because he found out he was dying and like most people wanted to just say before he went out,

05:43.960 --> 05:53.960
sorry, I fucked up. I did that because I was angry and I, and no matter how many times I tell you, you're not going to live forever.

05:53.960 --> 05:56.960
I realized right at the end that this is no joke.

05:56.960 --> 06:03.960
You're saying that his church might have excommunicated him because he repented about not being homophobic?

06:03.960 --> 06:08.960
These are the weird things is that his son, who's long since out of the church, like all of his sons, I believe,

06:08.960 --> 06:16.960
Facebook said, well, my dad is on his deathbed and he's been excommunicated for a year.

06:16.960 --> 06:27.960
And in the body of that Facebook entry, comments on the idea that the family won't let anyone talk to this guy.

06:27.960 --> 06:32.960
They won't let anyone who's also excommunicated talk to him.

06:32.960 --> 06:37.960
That's what made me go, what's going on here?

06:37.960 --> 06:40.960
This is all just gossip and garbage. This isn't news.

06:40.960 --> 06:45.960
To get excommunicated would be to not be as homophobic as you're supposed to be.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.960
To come back on that stance.

06:48.960 --> 07:01.960
That's what I'm asking. The guy that God hates fags, Colonel Sanders, is sick and dying and was apparently excommunicated a while ago

07:01.960 --> 07:07.960
and no one can talk to him, including people who have also been excommunicated, which he is.

07:07.960 --> 07:11.960
And I kept trying to untangle that and I spent 40 minutes and then I gave up.

07:11.960 --> 07:16.960
So does anybody in the audience able to untangle any of that?

07:16.960 --> 07:19.960
Okay, I see three heads shaking.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.960
So that's good.

07:22.960 --> 07:28.960
Now we imbue it with our mythology, which I believe is probably the uplifting part of that is

07:28.960 --> 07:31.960
somewhere there's an old man dying.

07:31.960 --> 07:34.960
Because in a properly functioning church you get excommunicated for saying the things that he said.

07:34.960 --> 07:41.960
Your theory is that he might have been excommunicated because he stopped toe on the party line and stopped being a...

07:41.960 --> 07:45.960
Here's my theory. It's not based on science at all. I don't care.

07:45.960 --> 07:50.960
Because I'm a fan of story and character and mythology and this isn't news. This is gossip.

07:50.960 --> 07:55.960
This guy was only ever famous. God bless everyone who made him famous

07:55.960 --> 08:02.960
because this whole thing furthered, in my opinion, it's a catalyst.

08:02.960 --> 08:09.960
It fires up gay rights advocacy when you look at somebody standing outside a navy funeral

08:09.960 --> 08:13.960
with a sign that says God hates fags. That was the whole point of this.

08:13.960 --> 08:18.960
It was iconography. This person didn't have tanks outside of Poland.

08:18.960 --> 08:23.960
This person had a couple of fucking rednecks hanging out with him in his living room.

08:23.960 --> 08:26.960
That was his congregation.

08:26.960 --> 08:31.960
The interesting story about this as he dies and lies in his death bed is

08:31.960 --> 08:39.960
is he dying in isolation? Does he actually want to say to somebody that he's sorry?

08:39.960 --> 08:47.960
Is he being denied that? That's what's crazy to me. That's what's fascinating.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.960
We have to find out. I hate mysteries.

08:49.960 --> 08:54.960
We have that and the Malaysian plane looming over our heads right now.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.960
Malaysian plane segments!

08:57.960 --> 09:00.960
Play the Malaysian pink.

09:05.960 --> 09:10.960
There's a plane that was flying and it disappeared and nobody knows where it went.

09:10.960 --> 09:15.960
It's the new balloon boy. It's a Malaysian plane.

09:15.960 --> 09:21.960
But it's more tragic because real human lives are happening.

09:21.960 --> 09:25.960
Do you remember the balloon boy?

09:25.960 --> 09:31.960
Here's the part of the balloon boy thing that I didn't remember and never knew about.

09:31.960 --> 09:37.960
I was busy. I was making TV history somewhere when balloon boy was happening.

09:37.960 --> 09:43.960
I was floating over the tree tops of Fox having a pitch meeting.

09:43.960 --> 09:52.960
There's a balloon boy. There's a boy in the balloon and the balloon is floating all around.

09:52.960 --> 09:59.960
I saw you shake your head at the audience and I saw them. I know you guys are all against me.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.960
We were watching the balloon.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.960
You're the balloon boy.

10:04.960 --> 10:13.960
There's a Rick and Morty writer who pulled this up on the YouTube and showed us.

10:13.960 --> 10:19.960
Do you guys remember when this happened that on CNN or something?

10:19.960 --> 10:25.960
The moment when it broke that the balloon boy thing was a hoax, a deliberate hoax.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.960
Not a hoax on the part of the kid but an engineered hoax on the part of the dad.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.960
I didn't remember any of this. I didn't care about the balloon boy.

10:31.960 --> 10:35.960
You're busy during certain public events.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.960
He was never in the balloon, right?

10:37.960 --> 10:39.960
He was never in the balloon. Then the dad was like...

10:39.960 --> 10:44.960
There's a news clip. Does everyone see the...

10:44.960 --> 10:47.960
With the fart?

10:47.960 --> 10:49.960
Most of the...

10:49.960 --> 10:52.960
I didn't know anything about this.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.960
Kumail's shaking his head so that's good enough for me.

10:55.960 --> 11:02.960
Are you shaking your head going, why are you trucking out the balloon boy?

11:02.960 --> 11:05.960
No, I don't know what the fart does.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.960
Okay, okay, good. That's what I thought.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.960
Later on tonight, Kumail Anjiani will be our guest.

11:11.960 --> 11:16.960
I have another reason to be upset. You now have a better Kumail impression than I do.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.960
That was pretty good.

11:19.960 --> 11:25.960
You walk a fucking tightrope, you do a Kumail impression because...

11:25.960 --> 11:31.960
Kumail's career has become a monument to not fucking selling out,

11:31.960 --> 11:36.960
not trading on the things that make him different from the people that are watching.

11:36.960 --> 11:39.960
You know what I mean? I don't know if I'm not articulating that well enough,

11:39.960 --> 11:41.960
but I remember early on him coming out,

11:41.960 --> 11:43.960
every conversation I had with him talking about like,

11:43.960 --> 11:46.960
oh yeah, I'll go for this audition. I won't go for that one.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.960
Here's the meticulous reason why.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.960
The fact that it pays off if you're smart and actually further...

11:53.960 --> 11:56.960
Anyway, I'm embarrassing him.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.960
The last thing you want to do is reward all of that by going like,

11:59.960 --> 12:02.960
oh I'm Kumail, look at me.

12:02.960 --> 12:06.960
But that will be the end result of everything

12:06.960 --> 12:09.960
because if he becomes Woody Allen, then what happens?

12:09.960 --> 12:11.960
Woody Allen.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.960
You celebrate someone's...

12:13.960 --> 12:15.960
Was that Kumail or Woody Allen?

12:15.960 --> 12:19.960
All right, so just Google this, find it somehow.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.960
They're on a couch, right?

12:21.960 --> 12:24.960
They're all on a couch, they're all on a couch in a row.

12:24.960 --> 12:28.960
And the dad is like, hey, why didn't you...

12:28.960 --> 12:32.960
The CNN wants to know, why didn't you come out when you were hiding?

12:32.960 --> 12:38.960
And the kid goes like, hi, you told us that it was for the show?

12:38.960 --> 12:40.960
And the dad goes...

12:40.960 --> 12:42.960
And then there's this...

12:42.960 --> 12:49.960
And you can spend three hours watching it, debating whether it's the kid

12:49.960 --> 12:52.960
or the dad that's farting.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.960
It's really, really great.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.960
I just think there was a lot going on in the world

12:58.960 --> 13:01.960
and also a lot going on during that CNN satellite interview.

13:01.960 --> 13:05.960
So it just kind of slipped by us, it wasn't like the fart herd around the world.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.960
It really needs, we need to go back.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.960
Were their charges filed or pressed?

13:11.960 --> 13:14.960
Did someone go to jail or get fined for that?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.960
For wasting our time?

13:16.960 --> 13:18.960
Is that one of those things where there's no fining?

13:18.960 --> 13:20.960
Yes, actually they had to pay restitution.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.960
I think I looked it up on Wikipedia.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.960
I think they had to give a little bit of restitution.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.960
No, wait, did they?

13:26.960 --> 13:28.960
Restitution.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.960
No, I think I'm mixing something else up.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.960
Because I think CNN, you know...

13:35.960 --> 13:37.960
I just high-fived Kumail.

13:37.960 --> 13:41.960
You know what I picture happening in the parking lot of that whole event?

13:41.960 --> 13:46.960
Is the government coming up to a circus of news cameramen and producers

13:46.960 --> 13:48.960
and going like, anybody want to press charges?

13:48.960 --> 13:51.960
And they're like, no, we're good.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.960
We did it.

13:53.960 --> 13:58.960
We got everything out of this we would have gotten if a baby had been in a balloon.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.960
That's what's for sale.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.960
Buy Snickers. Good night.

14:02.960 --> 14:09.960
It's a stupid question to ask. How does a plane disappear in a world full of surveillance,

14:09.960 --> 14:11.960
a big-ass plane full of human beings?

14:11.960 --> 14:13.960
How do they not fucking know?

14:13.960 --> 14:15.960
I don't know. Let Rob Delaney talk about that.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.960
What was your conspiracy theory earlier?

14:17.960 --> 14:20.960
Oh, okay, come on.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.960
No, but that was over drinks.

14:22.960 --> 14:28.960
I don't know, is it politically incorrect right now to be making bits about...

14:28.960 --> 14:33.960
These people are gone dead. These are human beings.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.960
It's in poor taste to do bits.

14:35.960 --> 14:39.960
I wouldn't call it a bit about the tragedy of these people dying.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.960
I was just saying...

14:41.960 --> 14:44.960
No, but my bit is specifically hint, never mind.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.960
It was a sci-fi conceit, that's all. Everyone's thinking about it.

14:47.960 --> 14:52.960
You were saying that as a fetishist of storytelling...

14:52.960 --> 14:54.960
Over drinks, we were saying this.

14:54.960 --> 14:59.960
But as a fetishist of story and story structure and character,

14:59.960 --> 15:03.960
that you can't help but project onto this...

15:03.960 --> 15:06.960
Like a guy in goggles coming in the cockpit and going,

15:06.960 --> 15:10.960
listen, you have to take this plane down.

15:10.960 --> 15:15.960
There's a guy in E3 that's going to give birth to Hitler.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.960
New Hitler.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.960
Nose dive now.

15:20.960 --> 15:24.960
It's not funny.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.960
Shame on you.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.960
Originally it wasn't New Hitler.

15:29.960 --> 15:33.960
It was the guy who was going to give birth to space aides.

15:33.960 --> 15:39.960
I haven't even typed a word of this yet.

15:39.960 --> 15:44.960
I want to thank Greg and Charles for buying me a drink at the drawing room.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.960
They came here from San Jose.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.960
There's always a pilgrimage that comes out here.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.960
Greg, are you here?

15:51.960 --> 15:53.960
Hey, Greg.

15:53.960 --> 15:57.960
Greg and Charles drove five hours from San Jose.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.960
Who else drove further?

15:59.960 --> 16:03.960
San Francisco?

16:03.960 --> 16:05.960
Sacramento.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.960
Sacramento.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.960
Now we get into what you drove here for.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.960
And those guys drove here for how it's made.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.960
Anybody here from Malaysian flight 441?

16:13.960 --> 16:17.960
To me, it's not funny. To Jeff, it is.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.960
I want that on record for TMZ.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.960
That's a different flight number.

16:21.960 --> 16:23.960
Is it right?

16:23.960 --> 16:25.960
Did I get it right?

16:25.960 --> 16:29.960
The 370, that's not funny.

16:29.960 --> 16:35.960
Flight 441 landed safely in Beijing hours ago.

16:35.960 --> 16:41.960
Thank you Greg and Charles for buying me a drink at the drawing room before the show.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.960
Everybody that drove here tonight, sorry.

16:44.960 --> 16:48.960
It's $10. What the fuck do you want?

16:48.960 --> 16:52.960
How about that Fred Phelps?

16:52.960 --> 16:56.960
Let's do our next segment, our regular annual segment,

16:56.960 --> 17:08.960
South by Southwest Breakdown with Kumail Nanjiani!

17:08.960 --> 17:12.960
Hello, hello.

17:12.960 --> 17:16.960
Hello, hello.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.960
How's it going guys?

17:18.960 --> 17:20.960
It's going good.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.960
Can I just say this?

17:22.960 --> 17:24.960
Oh, no.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.960
Can I just say, this is me, I'm Camille!

17:28.960 --> 17:32.960
Hey everybody!

17:32.960 --> 17:38.960
No, I bet that's not what Fred Phelps' thing is, unfortunately.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.960
I'm sure his brain is gone.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.960
Why would they excommunicate him?

17:42.960 --> 17:46.960
Why wouldn't they deify him and put him under a glass?

17:46.960 --> 17:48.960
Because he's probably crazy and shitting his pants or something.

17:48.960 --> 17:52.960
Why would they excommunicate him?

17:52.960 --> 17:54.960
That's a specific thing.

17:54.960 --> 18:00.960
This may all be based on one thing that his one kid said on Facebook,

18:00.960 --> 18:04.960
and now it's been added to his Wikipedia.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.960
Because we don't actually know.

18:06.960 --> 18:10.960
Fred Phelps' excommunication, and the only thing that's there

18:10.960 --> 18:14.960
is this continual reference to the fact that his kid said that.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.960
I will say, I've never been sexually attracted to a guy,

18:16.960 --> 18:20.960
but I will make out with a dude at his funeral.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.960
I thought you were going to say, I would fuck Fred Phelps.

18:24.960 --> 18:28.960
If he's up for it, I'll take that hit for everybody.

18:28.960 --> 18:32.960
What if he comes out before he dies?

18:32.960 --> 18:34.960
What if that was it?

18:34.960 --> 18:38.960
Would it be the biggest shock in the world,

18:38.960 --> 18:42.960
or would it be the third, fourth, eighth biggest shock in the history of...

18:42.960 --> 18:50.960
My brief Googling, he was a lawyer and he was a civil rights activist.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.960
He was?

18:52.960 --> 18:54.960
He was a civil rights activist.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.960
Something happened to this guy.

18:56.960 --> 19:02.960
Something happened to everyone who decides that in addition to letting gay people

19:02.960 --> 19:06.960
just be alienated by virtue of being gay, that you actually have to go after them.

19:06.960 --> 19:10.960
Something has to happen to you to pick on gay people.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.960
At funerals of like soldiers who've died,

19:12.960 --> 19:14.960
that's such a long connection to make,

19:14.960 --> 19:20.960
because the connection is that wars are God's way of punishing homosexuality

19:20.960 --> 19:23.960
in our sins, so the people who go to war are...

19:23.960 --> 19:25.960
What's the logic? Does anyone know what the logic is?

19:25.960 --> 19:28.960
Because he's not protesting funerals of gay people.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.960
He's protesting soldiers who've died in wars.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.960
Some holdover... Yeah, it wasn't gay soldiers, right?

19:34.960 --> 19:39.960
It wasn't gay soldiers. It's something like war happens because gays,

19:39.960 --> 19:41.960
so if we go to...

19:41.960 --> 19:44.960
And it's weirdly, I think, like supporting the dead soldiers.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.960
Like, hey, if we didn't have gays, your son would still be alive.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.960
Like, it's some weird logic like that.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.960
I didn't know that. I always assumed it was...

19:51.960 --> 19:55.960
That's right, right? I mean, it's wrong, but it's right.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.960
It's so wrong, it's right.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.960
Somebody back there feels pretty strong that that's right.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.960
Yeah, feels right.

20:01.960 --> 20:02.960
Feels right.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.960
What a long... What a pitch meeting where he's like,

20:04.960 --> 20:07.960
listen, guys, I got an idea. You have to stay with me.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.960
It's a long way to get there.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.960
Go long.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.960
Yeah, go long.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.960
Hold up both hands. Good luck.

20:15.960 --> 20:20.960
I went on a rabbit hole today because the first thing that happens is the Twitter jokes.

20:20.960 --> 20:21.960
Wait, what's happening?

20:21.960 --> 20:22.960
I'm not... You're wrong.

20:22.960 --> 20:23.960
It's wrong.

20:23.960 --> 20:27.960
I have a really strong source right here.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.960
Okay, well, what is it? Why does he...

20:29.960 --> 20:31.960
What else is here?

20:31.960 --> 20:33.960
What is it?

20:33.960 --> 20:37.960
It's because soldiers are fighting for this country and this country is supporting gay people.

20:37.960 --> 20:38.960
Oh, okay.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.960
Okay, so it's sort of similar.

20:40.960 --> 20:45.960
She said soldiers are supporting this country and this country supports gay people, so...

20:45.960 --> 20:48.960
You're a gay by association.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.960
So it is anti the soldiers that are dying.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.960
Yeah, they deserve to die because they support the gay vote in our country.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.960
He says Faganabler.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.960
Faganabler? He calls soldiers Faganablers?

21:00.960 --> 21:04.960
Faganabler is actually the name of my battle bot.

21:04.960 --> 21:09.960
I don't know if you guys remember when I was a contender in battle bots.

21:09.960 --> 21:10.960
It did pretty well, right?

21:10.960 --> 21:13.960
I never meant it to be pronounced that way.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.960
It's Faganabler.

21:15.960 --> 21:20.960
It was Dr. Faganabler.

21:20.960 --> 21:25.960
In the UK, they just thought it was a guy who sold cigarettes to miners.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.960
I went down a brief rabbit hole.

21:28.960 --> 21:36.960
I think the internet is such a beautiful pudding of hatred and toxicity and juvenileity and outrage and reflex.

21:36.960 --> 21:43.960
And then these beautiful clouds and streaks of, oh my God, we're all going to be fine.

21:43.960 --> 22:04.960
I just went down the rabbit hole of a lot of wonderful blog essays from gay people whose straight friends are absolutely justifiably taking the opportunity to go,

22:04.960 --> 22:14.960
yeah, burn in hell, you fucking fag hater, but who personally just want to take the time to say, you know, just more of the same.

22:14.960 --> 22:20.960
Not to cast dispersions, not to, I appreciate the advocacy, I appreciate the support,

22:20.960 --> 22:30.960
but this is just an old senile man who was pushed to the forefront in the media because of an agenda that needs to be made conscious of

22:30.960 --> 22:37.960
and to hate each other for anything is always the wrong answer.

22:37.960 --> 22:44.960
But I also understand, like, if you're gay and you're persecuted and there's a guy who's protesting soldiers' funerals because they're Faganablers,

22:44.960 --> 22:47.960
I mean, I can understand someone being really angry about it.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.960
Everyone has permission to do it.

22:49.960 --> 22:55.960
Nobody is going to punish you for doing it, so what do you do in that moment?

22:55.960 --> 23:02.960
Nobody is going to judge you for stabbing this guy in the face, so here's your knife.

23:02.960 --> 23:03.960
What is he dying for?

23:03.960 --> 23:04.960
What are you going to do?

23:04.960 --> 23:09.960
I guess, I don't know the details, huh?

23:09.960 --> 23:11.960
Yeah, he got spaces.

23:11.960 --> 23:15.960
I was trying to think of what the joke would be, I'm like, what am I doing?

23:15.960 --> 23:16.960
I couldn't think of the joke either.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.960
There's a Sudoku puzzle on my chest.

23:18.960 --> 23:19.960
It's hard.

23:19.960 --> 23:23.960
Do we know how he's dying? Is he dead? Is he hanging on?

23:23.960 --> 23:26.960
He's super old. I think he's just dying because...

23:26.960 --> 23:28.960
Because the ravages of time.

23:28.960 --> 23:29.960
The ravages of time, yeah.

23:29.960 --> 23:30.960
And space aids.

23:30.960 --> 23:31.960
Yeah.

23:31.960 --> 23:32.960
Yeah.

23:32.960 --> 23:33.960
Alright, enough about this ass.

23:33.960 --> 23:37.960
If we talk about him a second longer than Harold Ramis, I'll fucking kill myself.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.960
Then the world is committed to crime.

23:40.960 --> 23:41.960
Yeah.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.960
I wasn't here when you guys talked about Harold Ramis.

23:43.960 --> 23:44.960
That was...

23:44.960 --> 23:49.960
I had this weird thing, so I do this podcast called The Inner Kids with Emily,

23:49.960 --> 23:53.960
and I started talking about, oh, thank you, Harold Ramis.

23:53.960 --> 23:55.960
And I started crying, and I couldn't stop crying.

23:55.960 --> 23:59.960
And I figured out it was because, and I told the story there,

23:59.960 --> 24:02.960
do we want to talk about Harold Ramis again?

24:02.960 --> 24:04.960
Sure, no, tell, yeah.

24:04.960 --> 24:05.960
Okay, so this happened...

24:05.960 --> 24:06.960
I want to see you cry.

24:06.960 --> 24:07.960
No, I'm not going to cry.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.960
Watch me not cry, motherfuckers.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.960
Already, it's hard.

24:13.960 --> 24:16.960
No, because obviously I loved Ghostbusters and stuff, but...

24:16.960 --> 24:18.960
He's already crying.

24:18.960 --> 24:22.960
Yes, I'm crying out.

24:22.960 --> 24:23.960
Groundhog Day.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.960
I love that movie, and this is sort of a weird story,

24:26.960 --> 24:28.960
but stick with it because she's okay now.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.960
But when Emily and I first started dating, she got really sick,

24:31.960 --> 24:33.960
and it was like this weird, mysterious thing.

24:33.960 --> 24:36.960
And we'd been only dating a few months, and she was in a coma for eight days.

24:36.960 --> 24:37.960
It's a crazy...

24:37.960 --> 24:38.960
Yeah, it's sort of out of nowhere.

24:38.960 --> 24:39.960
Did you hit her?

24:39.960 --> 24:40.960
Huh?

24:40.960 --> 24:47.960
While she was in a coma, then she's not learning her lesson.

24:47.960 --> 24:50.960
Wow, that was a roller coaster of...

24:50.960 --> 24:51.960
Yeah!

24:51.960 --> 24:54.960
And that's the story I wanted to tell.

24:54.960 --> 24:55.960
That's...

24:55.960 --> 24:58.960
I hope somebody was recording that exchange.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.960
We're back in Hollywood Squares.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.960
New comedy golden age.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.960
They want to move me to Center Square because of that exchange.

25:06.960 --> 25:11.960
They're like, we're getting Bruce Valencia out of there.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.960
So she got really sick, and it was crazy,

25:13.960 --> 25:15.960
and we'd only been dating a few months, and...

25:15.960 --> 25:17.960
Oh, God.

25:17.960 --> 25:18.960
Her parents...

25:18.960 --> 25:19.960
So her parents and I hung out for a while,

25:19.960 --> 25:21.960
and that's when I sort of told my parents

25:21.960 --> 25:24.960
that I wasn't going to marry the woman that they found for me,

25:24.960 --> 25:26.960
that it was going to be this woman who's in a coma,

25:26.960 --> 25:28.960
who's hopefully going to come out,

25:28.960 --> 25:30.960
and if she comes out, I'm going to marry her.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.960
And if she doesn't, well, then the world ends anyway.

25:32.960 --> 25:33.960
So, oh, God.

25:33.960 --> 25:34.960
Okay.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.960
But when she finally came out, and she was fine,

25:36.960 --> 25:38.960
and the first night I got to stay in the hospital with her,

25:38.960 --> 25:41.960
and she was up, I was allowed to bring in a laptop.

25:41.960 --> 25:44.960
And I was like, what movie do we want to watch?

25:44.960 --> 25:45.960
The Groundhog Day.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.960
And it was so profound, because every day,

25:47.960 --> 25:49.960
I've been at the hospital all day, every day,

25:49.960 --> 25:51.960
so it sort of was living Groundhog Day.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.960
Like, it was the same day over and over,

25:53.960 --> 25:55.960
but I remember watching this movie with Emily,

25:55.960 --> 25:57.960
who's up now, and being like,

25:57.960 --> 25:59.960
oh, everything's going to be okay.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.960
So, you know, you sort of connect to people

26:01.960 --> 26:03.960
because of the things they've done,

26:03.960 --> 26:05.960
but that was like a very special thing for me.

26:05.960 --> 26:09.960
So when he sort of died, that really, like, hit me.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.960
Not hard, but in a way, I was like,

26:11.960 --> 26:14.960
oh, that guy had a profound effect on both our lives

26:14.960 --> 26:17.960
in a way that he never really, he doesn't know, you know?

26:17.960 --> 26:18.960
He has no idea what that means.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.960
Yeah, it was never really, it wasn't one of the people,

26:21.960 --> 26:25.960
the people whose impact we acknowledge while they're alive.

26:25.960 --> 26:26.960
Yeah.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.960
I don't know what their deal is,

26:28.960 --> 26:30.960
but I know that the really important people

26:30.960 --> 26:33.960
are the people who unexpectedly, like,

26:33.960 --> 26:36.960
that blanket has slipped out from underneath us,

26:36.960 --> 26:38.960
and suddenly, everything is disrupted.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.960
And I know, and I've confessed to this,

26:41.960 --> 26:43.960
I know this is all narcissism and all ego,

26:43.960 --> 26:45.960
but how else are you supposed to process someone else's death?

26:45.960 --> 26:46.960
Right.

26:46.960 --> 26:49.960
But I've had, yeah, whatever.

26:49.960 --> 26:51.960
I'm repeating myself, but I'm walking down a sidewalk

26:51.960 --> 26:53.960
and per bank, and I'm just processing this

26:53.960 --> 26:55.960
and the way I do every celebrity death,

26:55.960 --> 26:57.960
and like, what does this mean to me?

26:57.960 --> 26:59.960
Why was he important, and then all of a sudden,

26:59.960 --> 27:01.960
I'm just fucking weeping.

27:01.960 --> 27:06.960
And it was definitely because this was a purveyor of,

27:06.960 --> 27:10.960
I mean, like Groundhog Day is,

27:10.960 --> 27:15.960
it should definitely be put in a canister

27:15.960 --> 27:17.960
and shot toward other planets,

27:17.960 --> 27:21.960
because it's the best we can do in a modern civilization

27:21.960 --> 27:29.960
of creating a new, not a, I mean, there's creation myths,

27:29.960 --> 27:31.960
but then there's the part of mythology

27:31.960 --> 27:37.960
that just tells you, like, you know, soothes you,

27:37.960 --> 27:39.960
like reminds you that everything's fucked

27:39.960 --> 27:42.960
and that you need to be who you are,

27:42.960 --> 27:45.960
and it's a story about God holding a man still

27:45.960 --> 27:50.960
until he can't stop, until he can't squirm anymore.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.960
And you just watch it happen,

27:52.960 --> 27:59.960
and what's amazing about that movie is that any hokey or movie

27:59.960 --> 28:04.960
would have easily gotten away with ending the story with him

28:04.960 --> 28:10.960
just becoming a good guy to her and learning her favorite color,

28:10.960 --> 28:12.960
and I've got ice cream on the windowsill,

28:12.960 --> 28:16.960
and in that movie, that's where shit really goes bad,

28:16.960 --> 28:19.960
because he's really becoming an asshole now,

28:19.960 --> 28:20.960
because it's one thing to rob a bank,

28:20.960 --> 28:23.960
and it's one thing to eat all the M&Ms you want,

28:23.960 --> 28:28.960
but it's another thing to fucking fabricate

28:28.960 --> 28:31.960
the spark between one human and another,

28:31.960 --> 28:34.960
and then he leaves that rom-com world,

28:34.960 --> 28:37.960
and he just takes piano lessons and he just, you know,

28:37.960 --> 28:39.960
catches the same cat out of the same tree and blah, blah, blah,

28:39.960 --> 28:43.960
and it's at that point that he actually has something with her.

28:43.960 --> 28:44.960
Anyways, alright, so...

28:44.960 --> 28:46.960
Let's see where he's trying to save the homeless men

28:46.960 --> 28:48.960
from dying over and over.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.960
That's such a great, like, moment.

28:50.960 --> 28:54.960
I mean, it's a fantastic, I mean, if aliens attack us

28:54.960 --> 28:57.960
and they want to kill us, we show them Groundhog Day

28:57.960 --> 29:00.960
and give them Nutella, and they'll be like, alright.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.960
You guys have done good.

29:03.960 --> 29:05.960
There should be theologians who study that,

29:05.960 --> 29:09.960
who ask things like, does he save the homeless guy

29:09.960 --> 29:11.960
after a certain point?

29:11.960 --> 29:13.960
The story would indicate that he learned the lesson

29:13.960 --> 29:15.960
that that guy's just gonna freeze to death

29:15.960 --> 29:17.960
and start to death on the sidewalk,

29:17.960 --> 29:19.960
and you tried everything there,

29:19.960 --> 29:21.960
so you got a piano lesson and just do it.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.960
They don't dwell on that.

29:23.960 --> 29:26.960
It's a more uplifting movie than that,

29:26.960 --> 29:28.960
but those are also...

29:28.960 --> 29:29.960
That's what I'm saying.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.960
You could launch that movie to Mars,

29:31.960 --> 29:33.960
start a civilization based on it,

29:33.960 --> 29:35.960
and then a new generation could say,

29:35.960 --> 29:37.960
well, did he save the homeless guy every time?

29:37.960 --> 29:39.960
And then you could go, well, you know,

29:39.960 --> 29:42.960
some people say he did, but other people...

29:42.960 --> 29:45.960
You know what, if you've got a piano lesson,

29:45.960 --> 29:47.960
you need to learn piano.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.960
That's gonna help more people.

29:49.960 --> 29:51.960
I want to see a sequel to that movie

29:51.960 --> 29:53.960
where it's just him dazzling people

29:53.960 --> 29:55.960
by making ice sculptures,

29:55.960 --> 29:57.960
and they're like, where did you find the time?

29:57.960 --> 29:59.960
There's a comic book series

29:59.960 --> 30:01.960
where time unfreezes a different time for him,

30:01.960 --> 30:03.960
and so there's, like, different Bill Murrays

30:03.960 --> 30:05.960
who are, like, champion ice sculptors.

30:05.960 --> 30:06.960
Yeah.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.960
Or, like, what if it ended too early

30:08.960 --> 30:10.960
and he was, like, halfway good,

30:10.960 --> 30:12.960
so he's still trying to impress people?

30:12.960 --> 30:14.960
Like, that's pretty good, right?

30:14.960 --> 30:16.960
I mean, I can't do the head right,

30:16.960 --> 30:18.960
but he's better than you can do.

30:18.960 --> 30:21.960
All right, so how was South by Southwest for you?

30:21.960 --> 30:23.960
Oh, I had an awesome time.

30:23.960 --> 30:25.960
Well, your head was everywhere.

30:25.960 --> 30:28.960
Uh, yeah, they really pushed that show.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.960
What does it like to be in an airport

30:30.960 --> 30:32.960
with the huge...

30:32.960 --> 30:37.960
And at the exact moment when I feel

30:37.960 --> 30:39.960
the angriest at the government,

30:39.960 --> 30:44.960
when I feel the most put down by mainstream society,

30:44.960 --> 30:48.960
if my head was above the metal detectors,

30:48.960 --> 30:51.960
like, I don't know, I would explode.

30:51.960 --> 30:53.960
You're right, it's Orwellian.

30:53.960 --> 30:55.960
It kind of feels like, well, it was these guys' idea.

30:55.960 --> 30:57.960
I get angry at them.

30:57.960 --> 30:58.960
It really does feel like that.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.960
Did it make you feel like taking your shoes off

31:00.960 --> 31:02.960
was, did it mitigate?

31:02.960 --> 31:04.960
Or did it make you feel like...

31:04.960 --> 31:06.960
I know I had a moment where I was...

31:06.960 --> 31:08.960
I felt I was in the wrong line,

31:08.960 --> 31:10.960
like, I got into the pre-screening line

31:10.960 --> 31:13.960
and I wasn't pre-screened, and I had this whole thing.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.960
Because you'd want to be normal.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.960
Where's my ID? It's right behind you, asshole.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.960
You motherfucker, have you heard of Mike Judge?

31:20.960 --> 31:24.960
Okay, well, you should really look into his stuff.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.960
So, I was telling you,

31:26.960 --> 31:29.960
there were also on cabs and stuff, those pictures,

31:29.960 --> 31:31.960
and we were all so excited, all five of us,

31:31.960 --> 31:33.960
and we were walking down the street,

31:33.960 --> 31:34.960
and this cab was parked there.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.960
So, it's me, Martin Starr, T.J. Miller,

31:36.960 --> 31:38.960
Zach Roads, and Thomas Middleditch,

31:38.960 --> 31:40.960
and all our faces were on this cab.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.960
This cab was parked there, and we were all walking by,

31:42.960 --> 31:44.960
and we were like, hey, can we get a picture in front of this?

31:44.960 --> 31:45.960
We just walked up to this guy.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.960
I was like, we're going to make this guy's day.

31:47.960 --> 31:49.960
Watch this.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.960
You have a horrible knife driving a cab.

31:51.960 --> 31:54.960
Here's a little bit of goodness for you.

31:54.960 --> 31:56.960
So, we walked up all arrogant, and we were like,

31:56.960 --> 31:58.960
hey, can we take a picture in front of this cab?

31:58.960 --> 32:03.960
Here's $5, and he said, no, and drove off.

32:03.960 --> 32:08.960
He left his parking spot to, like, not take a picture with us.

32:08.960 --> 32:09.960
He wasn't a fan?

32:09.960 --> 32:11.960
I don't know what the deal was.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.960
The other thing is, they're also in New York,

32:13.960 --> 32:17.960
and of course, this is the month where my parents are in Pakistan.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.960
I'm still going to hear, like, hey,

32:19.960 --> 32:21.960
you should really go to med school, like,

32:21.960 --> 32:23.960
for the rest of my life.

32:23.960 --> 32:24.960
Yeah.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.960
I mean, you detect a lace, the whole time you're in Austin,

32:27.960 --> 32:29.960
every time we've been in Austin,

32:29.960 --> 32:31.960
from whatever festival we've been there,

32:31.960 --> 32:33.960
it's a city of festivals.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.960
That place is the eternal, it's the,

32:36.960 --> 32:38.960
Austin is the guy in your circle of friends

32:38.960 --> 32:40.960
whose apartment is just wide open,

32:40.960 --> 32:42.960
and everyone just hangs out there,

32:42.960 --> 32:44.960
and some people have been crashing there for three days,

32:44.960 --> 32:46.960
and he's not that excited about it.

32:46.960 --> 32:51.960
There's other apartments around, because that's fucking Texas.

32:51.960 --> 32:54.960
This is the cool apartment.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.960
And you get to, you know, you're marveling at Austin,

32:57.960 --> 33:01.960
and it's gorgeous there, and it's everything,

33:01.960 --> 33:07.960
it feels like a city that's just designed to kind of host you,

33:07.960 --> 33:10.960
and then, you know, through the miracle of Twitter and stuff,

33:10.960 --> 33:14.960
I'm able to see Austin locals going, like, you know,

33:14.960 --> 33:16.960
I don't know if you're right that you're here,

33:16.960 --> 33:18.960
but god damn this fucking thing.

33:18.960 --> 33:22.960
Yeah, I would be so angry, because it really does turn over the city.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.960
It was my first time there during the festival.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.960
I've been to Austin like a dozen or more times,

33:26.960 --> 33:28.960
and it's a bummer to be there, because you're like,

33:28.960 --> 33:30.960
my thing is I just want to be able to get to a place

33:30.960 --> 33:33.960
I want to go eat at, or see a show,

33:33.960 --> 33:35.960
and you can't move around there.

33:35.960 --> 33:36.960
It's so prohibitive.

33:36.960 --> 33:39.960
The amount that I get pissed at the LA Marathon,

33:39.960 --> 33:42.960
and please God forgive me,

33:42.960 --> 33:45.960
is that a real parade?

33:45.960 --> 33:47.960
Well, I mean, they block traffic a little bit,

33:47.960 --> 33:49.960
and then I get all huffed up, you know.

33:49.960 --> 33:52.960
This is the worst thing that's ever happened.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.960
Wait, what are you guys about again?

33:55.960 --> 33:58.960
Why can't I cross Hollywood? I have rights!

33:58.960 --> 34:01.960
You people should be able to relate to this.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.960
Yeah, think about it.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.960
Make the equation, for God's sakes.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.960
Get out of my way.

34:07.960 --> 34:09.960
That's what I'm saying.

34:09.960 --> 34:13.960
LA has a couple of things that disrupt it,

34:13.960 --> 34:16.960
but San Francisco and Austin, holy gemoli.

34:16.960 --> 34:19.960
The thing that I want to be able to do,

34:19.960 --> 34:23.960
I wish I could, because we're in bad economic times,

34:23.960 --> 34:27.960
so for all we know, Austin is like,

34:27.960 --> 34:29.960
they shouldn't be feeling that way.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.960
They should be thinking, holy shit,

34:31.960 --> 34:36.960
we would be Detroit if we didn't have 800 strangers

34:36.960 --> 34:39.960
per square inch flooding our city every week.

34:39.960 --> 34:42.960
But I don't know, and they don't know,

34:42.960 --> 34:43.960
and no one can know.

34:43.960 --> 34:45.960
You'd have to create a parallel universe

34:45.960 --> 34:48.960
where they didn't create that kind of...

34:48.960 --> 34:50.960
It's a wonderful life with Austin.

34:50.960 --> 34:52.960
With Austin as the protagonist,

34:52.960 --> 34:54.960
standing on a bridge about to jump,

34:54.960 --> 34:56.960
and going, I can't stand being the host

34:56.960 --> 34:58.960
of all these festivals anymore.

34:58.960 --> 34:59.960
But wait!

34:59.960 --> 35:02.960
I never saw the movie.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.960
Have you not seen it?

35:04.960 --> 35:06.960
When you got it, that's the movie.

35:06.960 --> 35:07.960
Yeah, I know.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.960
Well, there's these movies, like Wizard of Oz

35:09.960 --> 35:10.960
and Gone with the Wind.

35:10.960 --> 35:11.960
You never saw Wizard of Oz?

35:11.960 --> 35:12.960
I haven't.

35:12.960 --> 35:14.960
I don't think I've seen it all the way through.

35:14.960 --> 35:15.960
So you don't...

35:15.960 --> 35:18.960
But I have a piecemeal through every...

35:18.960 --> 35:19.960
I could tell you from...

35:19.960 --> 35:21.960
Okay, starts in black and white.

35:21.960 --> 35:23.960
She works on a farm.

35:23.960 --> 35:27.960
She's bummed out because it's in black and white.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.960
She meets every character that you're going to see

35:30.960 --> 35:32.960
as an animal.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.960
And then a tornado comes.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.960
She sings a song, and a tornado comes.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.960
She sings a tornado song,

35:38.960 --> 35:41.960
and the tornado makes everything go into color.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.960
Do you remember how the tornado song goes?

35:43.960 --> 35:46.960
Somewhere over the tornado.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.960
Is that the song?

35:48.960 --> 35:49.960
Somewhere over the rainbow.

35:49.960 --> 35:52.960
Like, tornado song, and then she lands...

35:52.960 --> 35:53.960
She lands on a witch.

35:53.960 --> 35:56.960
Now she's committed a crime before she even knows she does.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.960
These little people come up and they say,

35:58.960 --> 35:59.960
like, you killed the witch.

35:59.960 --> 36:01.960
And then another witch says, like,

36:01.960 --> 36:02.960
well, just...

36:02.960 --> 36:03.960
There's no problem.

36:03.960 --> 36:05.960
I know how you can get out of here.

36:05.960 --> 36:07.960
Follow the Yellow Brick Road.

36:07.960 --> 36:08.960
So she follows the Yellow Brick Road.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.960
She meets, not necessarily in this order,

36:10.960 --> 36:14.960
a skier crow, an iron man, and a...

36:14.960 --> 36:18.960
A lion, a lion.

36:18.960 --> 36:22.960
That would be great if it was the Iron Man.

36:22.960 --> 36:23.960
And she meets them all.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.960
They get attacked in no necessary order

36:25.960 --> 36:27.960
by trees, monkeys, and poppies.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.960
And then they go to the Emerald City.

36:30.960 --> 36:31.960
That's the meeting with the goddess.

36:31.960 --> 36:32.960
And they get there.

36:32.960 --> 36:33.960
And then they atone with the father,

36:33.960 --> 36:35.960
which is the fact that the Wizard of Oz

36:35.960 --> 36:37.960
is just a shithead behind a curtain.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.960
Toto finds that out.

36:39.960 --> 36:40.960
And then they...

36:40.960 --> 36:41.960
Somewhere along the line,

36:41.960 --> 36:43.960
they make the witch melt with water.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.960
I don't know if she comes into the Emerald City and is like,

36:46.960 --> 36:47.960
stop it!

36:47.960 --> 36:49.960
That part doesn't make any sense to me.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.960
But then, in one of the most egregious violations

36:52.960 --> 36:54.960
of my personal cinematic narrative rules,

36:54.960 --> 36:57.960
she finds out she could have gone home any time

36:57.960 --> 36:59.960
by clicking her heels.

36:59.960 --> 37:00.960
And so she does.

37:00.960 --> 37:01.960
And then she wakes up and...

37:01.960 --> 37:03.960
Does she wake up in black and white again?

37:03.960 --> 37:04.960
Yes.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.960
That's kind of a rip-off.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.960
But I guess how are you going to...

37:08.960 --> 37:11.960
Do you remember what the Iron Man and the lion

37:11.960 --> 37:13.960
and Scarecrow were searching for?

37:13.960 --> 37:14.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.960
The each are...

37:16.960 --> 37:18.960
The Cowardly Lion wants a heart.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.960
So he has a song about wanting a heart.

37:20.960 --> 37:22.960
No, Iron Man wants a heart.

37:22.960 --> 37:23.960
Iron Man wants a heart.

37:23.960 --> 37:24.960
Let him talk.

37:24.960 --> 37:25.960
He has an arc reactor.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.960
He wants a heart.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.960
Wait, okay.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.960
Thank you very much.

37:33.960 --> 37:34.960
You're right.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.960
Okay, so the Tin Man wants a heart.

37:36.960 --> 37:37.960
Tin Man, yes.

37:37.960 --> 37:38.960
He doesn't have a heart.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.960
I associate the heart with courage.

37:40.960 --> 37:41.960
What the fuck does the lion want?

37:41.960 --> 37:42.960
He has a diploma.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.960
I just want class.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.960
He literally gets a diploma at the end.

37:46.960 --> 37:47.960
Right?

37:47.960 --> 37:48.960
Lion...

37:48.960 --> 37:49.960
It's just courage.

37:49.960 --> 37:50.960
Or he gets a badge.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.960
Who gets the diploma?

37:52.960 --> 37:53.960
Scarecrow.

37:53.960 --> 37:56.960
Sloppy.

37:56.960 --> 38:00.960
So heart is courage, is bravery, is passion.

38:00.960 --> 38:01.960
So lump it together.

38:01.960 --> 38:04.960
Make one character out of three, represent those.

38:04.960 --> 38:05.960
Sorry.

38:05.960 --> 38:07.960
But the...

38:07.960 --> 38:11.960
Are you fixing a movie you haven't seen?

38:11.960 --> 38:12.960
There's a reason I won't watch it.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.960
It looks sloppy from a distance.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.960
That should be a fucking segment every episode.

38:17.960 --> 38:20.960
Dad fixes a movie he hasn't seen.

38:20.960 --> 38:24.960
We'll go down the AFI 100.

38:24.960 --> 38:25.960
Exactly.

38:25.960 --> 38:32.960
What's the major film that you haven't seen that you're embarrassed or that you're unrepentant

38:32.960 --> 38:33.960
about not having seen?

38:33.960 --> 38:36.960
Well, I mean, Wizard of Oz is a big one.

38:36.960 --> 38:38.960
It's a wonderful life.

38:38.960 --> 38:39.960
Yeah, that's a good movie.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.960
But it's so forced on you.

38:41.960 --> 38:45.960
It took me until my mid-20s to start watching Woody Allen movies.

38:45.960 --> 38:48.960
Because when I was growing up, it was like every stand-up would come out and go,

38:48.960 --> 38:56.960
and Woody Allen would go, and I didn't understand that he was an artist and that he was writing things.

38:56.960 --> 39:01.960
I also didn't understand that he was a guy that was a nerd that was putting himself in movies.

39:01.960 --> 39:07.960
I just thought that God made action figures that were famous and that this guy I was supposed

39:07.960 --> 39:12.960
to think was interesting because he had glasses and red hair.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.960
And then you had to shake that stuff.

39:14.960 --> 39:18.960
And those holiday movies, they're hard to swallow.

39:18.960 --> 39:19.960
It's a wonderful life.

39:19.960 --> 39:26.960
You have to really cut yourself off from the weight of it, of how everyone talks about it.

39:26.960 --> 39:27.960
But it's a good...

39:27.960 --> 39:28.960
I like that movie.

39:28.960 --> 39:29.960
It's a very small scene.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.960
But this is before...

39:31.960 --> 39:33.960
I've seen big parts of it, I think.

39:33.960 --> 39:34.960
I mean, I know that...

39:34.960 --> 39:39.960
Yeah, so the angel gets his wings when you ring the bell and Mr. Banks doesn't want the money

39:39.960 --> 39:42.960
in the potter in the whale chair.

39:42.960 --> 39:45.960
He finds out that if he wasn't around...

39:45.960 --> 39:46.960
Oh, yeah.

39:46.960 --> 39:49.960
The potter needs a heart.

39:49.960 --> 39:52.960
It sounds like its second act is a...

39:52.960 --> 39:54.960
It sounds like I kind of...

39:54.960 --> 39:56.960
Like, kind of long.

39:56.960 --> 39:57.960
Like, okay, we get it.

39:57.960 --> 39:58.960
I love this segment.

39:58.960 --> 40:00.960
How do you know how long is the second act?

40:00.960 --> 40:02.960
It sounds like it's kind of long.

40:02.960 --> 40:04.960
Because I've never heard...

40:04.960 --> 40:10.960
Like, throughout 41 years of living in a world that keeps referencing that movie,

40:10.960 --> 40:19.960
I've never heard anyone reference any structural flagstones that make a complete story.

40:19.960 --> 40:24.960
It sounds like this guy's gonna kill himself and then an angel comes up and says,

40:24.960 --> 40:25.960
Don't kill yourself.

40:25.960 --> 40:28.960
Why shouldn't I?

40:28.960 --> 40:30.960
I'll tell you why.

40:30.960 --> 40:33.960
Because if you did, things would be worse.

40:33.960 --> 40:35.960
And he's like, I don't believe you.

40:35.960 --> 40:40.960
It's just like one-third the Christmas Carol.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.960
And he takes him and he goes and shows him.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.960
He goes like, look at this.

40:44.960 --> 40:48.960
And he's like, oh my god, I can't believe I'm dead and people noticed.

40:48.960 --> 40:51.960
Except when we watch it now, Potterville is fucking awesome.

40:51.960 --> 40:53.960
Like, the Potterville is like...

40:53.960 --> 40:57.960
Everyone's just jitterbugging and there's this good music and it's like...

40:57.960 --> 40:59.960
You'd rather hang out in Potterville.

40:59.960 --> 41:01.960
You did ruin everything.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.960
But I like the part...

41:03.960 --> 41:05.960
I don't know the movie very well.

41:05.960 --> 41:08.960
I've only seen it a couple of times over a long amount of years.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.960
People are gasping, by the way.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.960
His house is all windy.

41:12.960 --> 41:15.960
The house that he bought, that he got with his wife and they had a family.

41:15.960 --> 41:17.960
And the house is shitty and it's drafting.

41:17.960 --> 41:19.960
It's falling apart and he's going broke.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.960
There's a run on the band.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.960
And the little, what do you call it?

41:23.960 --> 41:27.960
A little ball, a little knoll thing or knob thing that comes off at the end of the stairwell.

41:27.960 --> 41:30.960
And he starts yelling and his daughter is sick.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.960
She can knob off the stairwell. It just comes off.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.960
It comes off when they first move in the house and it's charming.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.960
The house is a fixer-upper.

41:37.960 --> 41:40.960
Like, this is a symbol that we have growing to do.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.960
Then it never changes.

41:42.960 --> 41:44.960
The house just keeps being shitty and it's getting shittier.

41:44.960 --> 41:48.960
And now his daughter on Christmas Eve or whatever has a cough and she's sick

41:48.960 --> 41:50.960
because it's so fucking cold in the house.

41:50.960 --> 41:51.960
Oh, Jesus.

41:51.960 --> 41:52.960
And he starts crying.

41:52.960 --> 41:57.960
So while the angel is proving to him how bad life would be,

41:57.960 --> 42:00.960
he's just getting angry at his family.

42:00.960 --> 42:02.960
I don't forget if he goes back at this point, I don't know, but at one point

42:02.960 --> 42:04.960
he starts yelling at his family and he becomes like,

42:04.960 --> 42:06.960
he's like, I didn't fucking ask for this shit.

42:06.960 --> 42:08.960
I don't fucking want to do this.

42:08.960 --> 42:09.960
I never wanted this.

42:09.960 --> 42:10.960
I always wanted to do something else.

42:10.960 --> 42:12.960
You guys made me do this shit.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.960
Like, fuck you, fuck me, fuck everybody.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.960
And it's the symbol of that piece of furniture breaking

42:17.960 --> 42:20.960
and he raises his voice at his little sick daughter,

42:20.960 --> 42:22.960
Zazu or whatever her name is.

42:22.960 --> 42:23.960
Zazu, what's it?

42:23.960 --> 42:24.960
Zuzu.

42:24.960 --> 42:28.960
And like that moment is like, shit gets really dark and he just implodes

42:28.960 --> 42:30.960
and that's when it starts to become not fake Capra.

42:30.960 --> 42:32.960
It becomes really punk rock and dark.

42:32.960 --> 42:36.960
And then Capra puts this beautiful little bow on it at the end,

42:36.960 --> 42:38.960
which is like, it's good stuff.

42:38.960 --> 42:40.960
Also, it's America that never existed.

42:40.960 --> 42:42.960
You know, it's a fake America.

42:42.960 --> 42:45.960
Oh, wasn't there something about a pharmacist that hit a kid so much

42:45.960 --> 42:46.960
he was deaf or something?

42:46.960 --> 42:47.960
He hit him.

42:47.960 --> 42:48.960
He can't hear to one ear because he clapped him.

42:48.960 --> 42:49.960
Oh, yeah, that's right.

42:49.960 --> 42:53.960
He tried to save him from putting, like he was senile or drunk or whatever

42:53.960 --> 42:54.960
and he was going to poison an old lady.

42:54.960 --> 42:55.960
Oh, yeah.

42:55.960 --> 42:57.960
And so he smashes him over the ear and he can't hear.

42:57.960 --> 42:59.960
He has a bad ear because of that.

42:59.960 --> 43:01.960
Isn't there also a part where they like propose

43:01.960 --> 43:04.960
and there's like a fake moon out the window that they put up?

43:04.960 --> 43:05.960
Do you remember that?

43:05.960 --> 43:06.960
Is that right?

43:06.960 --> 43:07.960
Right?

43:07.960 --> 43:08.960
They propose.

43:08.960 --> 43:09.960
I remember.

43:09.960 --> 43:13.960
So you guys as experts in this movie,

43:13.960 --> 43:16.960
we've all experienced the same amount of cinema.

43:16.960 --> 43:17.960
That's my point.

43:17.960 --> 43:22.960
No, that movie moved me and touched me.

43:22.960 --> 43:23.960
Prove it.

43:23.960 --> 43:27.960
Prove it with a rap.

43:27.960 --> 43:28.960
All right.

43:28.960 --> 43:29.960
No.

43:29.960 --> 43:32.960
By the way, speaking of, can I say, I told you this,

43:32.960 --> 43:40.960
that Dean Pelton rap is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my entire life.

43:40.960 --> 43:41.960
I watched it.

43:41.960 --> 43:43.960
I swear at least 30 times.

43:43.960 --> 43:45.960
It's so funny.

43:45.960 --> 43:46.960
It's so good.

43:46.960 --> 43:49.960
The first time I watched it, I didn't even laugh.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.960
I just didn't breathe for a while.

43:51.960 --> 43:53.960
It's so great.

43:53.960 --> 43:54.960
Yeah.

43:54.960 --> 43:59.960
Somebody online tempoed it and put it under a beat

43:59.960 --> 44:00.960
and it's amazing.

44:00.960 --> 44:05.960
Aaron played it for me.

44:05.960 --> 44:10.960
Don Diego and I wrote the lyrics overnight.

44:10.960 --> 44:13.960
Don Diego, you have a Spanish gentleman working for you?

44:13.960 --> 44:18.960
Is that just like your imaginary friend who does rewrites with you?

44:18.960 --> 44:19.960
Hello, Dan.

44:19.960 --> 44:21.960
I'm not alone.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.960
Don Diego is here.

44:23.960 --> 44:28.960
Were you asleep at your writing office at night and a figure emerged in the balcony?

44:28.960 --> 44:31.960
He definitely, we always tease him about that.

44:31.960 --> 44:37.960
Yeah, it's just Dan with a rose in his ear.

44:37.960 --> 44:43.960
But he kind of spat out a bunch of stuff and in the original thing that he threw out,

44:43.960 --> 44:47.960
it included the whole ending, which is that I didn't want to change.

44:47.960 --> 44:51.960
It's just like, Barack Obama is scared of me.

44:51.960 --> 44:55.960
And I was like, okay, we're going to keep that.

44:55.960 --> 44:57.960
But then we sat and it kind of nitpicked.

44:57.960 --> 45:01.960
And then when I heard it set to the beat, it was like, oh, that's a good rap.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.960
Yeah, well, yeah, it's a funny joke.

45:04.960 --> 45:05.960
It's great.

45:05.960 --> 45:07.960
I love it as much as everybody.

45:07.960 --> 45:09.960
I just love how quickly it goes south.

45:09.960 --> 45:12.960
He gets two lines out and then it's like, what the fuck is wrong?

45:12.960 --> 45:14.960
Because he wants to do a freestyle rap.

45:14.960 --> 45:17.960
He's got that character so much because he's like a children's book character.

45:17.960 --> 45:24.960
To me, that's like the other high point of him is when he comes in and he's a half man, half woman,

45:24.960 --> 45:26.960
because he wants to say that.

45:26.960 --> 45:29.960
And then he has this breakdown and goes, what am I doing?

45:29.960 --> 45:33.960
And it's like, I've got to fucking cool it and he runs out.

45:33.960 --> 45:36.960
And then he comes back at the end of the episode and goes, you know what?

45:36.960 --> 45:40.960
I thought about it and I had lunch with people who are interested in what makes me tick.

45:40.960 --> 45:42.960
And I had the best day of my life.

45:42.960 --> 45:44.960
He's like the pokey little puppy.

45:44.960 --> 45:49.960
He's so simultaneously like he represents.

45:49.960 --> 45:58.960
We equate complexity with the opposite of innocence too much.

45:58.960 --> 46:05.960
We think that innocence means purity and it doesn't.

46:05.960 --> 46:14.960
You could be the most complicated, most sexual, most labyrinthine person in the world

46:14.960 --> 46:16.960
and you could still be innocent.

46:16.960 --> 46:20.960
You don't have to be a cotton ball that just has no substance to it.

46:20.960 --> 46:23.960
We think like, oh, that won't hurt you.

46:23.960 --> 46:24.960
That's what innocence means.

46:24.960 --> 46:29.960
No, innocence means there's nothing that can hurt you here.

46:29.960 --> 46:31.960
This person wouldn't hurt you.

46:31.960 --> 46:37.960
He has a river that runs leagues deep underneath him, but he's innocent.

46:37.960 --> 46:39.960
And so he stumbles into these situations.

46:39.960 --> 46:44.960
And he's like, I'm going to do a freestyle rap because you're late.

46:44.960 --> 46:50.960
I can't pay you this week so I'm going to do this freestyle rap where you don't know what you're going to say next.

46:50.960 --> 46:56.960
And he starts rapping and he stumbles into the spirit of the street overtakes him

46:56.960 --> 47:02.960
and becomes a vessel for black anger and disenfranchised youth

47:02.960 --> 47:09.960
and has to run out of the room dressed as a peanut blocker.

47:09.960 --> 47:15.960
It really is the best show ever on TV.

47:15.960 --> 47:19.960
Well, at least that moment anyway.

47:19.960 --> 47:25.960
We all feel the same way in the writers room.

47:25.960 --> 47:34.960
And Jim Rash needs 50 takes of that because I kept being like, well, yeah,

47:34.960 --> 47:37.960
but the camera needs to be on you enough time.

47:37.960 --> 47:40.960
Is he doing that rap even when it's not his coverage?

47:40.960 --> 47:42.960
Was he giving it his all?

47:42.960 --> 47:44.960
Yeah, he is.

47:44.960 --> 47:49.960
But also the point of the rap is that it escalates and escalates and escalates until he's screaming.

47:49.960 --> 47:53.960
And so he's doing different takes from different angles.

47:53.960 --> 47:58.960
There are two moments when I've almost killed a man on that set.

47:58.960 --> 48:04.960
That's one and the other one is when Leonard, Richard Urban, the guy who plays Leonard,

48:04.960 --> 48:11.960
his first episode in season one, he was in a pool and he's treading water.

48:11.960 --> 48:17.960
You go through central casting and you order people off a menu.

48:17.960 --> 48:20.960
You go, I need an old guy that can swim.

48:20.960 --> 48:27.960
And you get Richard Erdman who was in Gunsmoke and had his own show and was on Sid Caesar.

48:27.960 --> 48:29.960
And you go to his IMDB page.

48:29.960 --> 48:34.960
So sometime afterward and realize I've been physically abusing television history.

48:34.960 --> 48:40.960
But in the meantime, I got an old guy that can swim and he's swimming.

48:40.960 --> 48:44.960
And I guess like his first, he's just supposed to be treading water in a pool

48:44.960 --> 48:48.960
and Jeff Winger said something and then he goes like,

48:48.960 --> 48:51.960
well, he's just busted, but what was it?

48:51.960 --> 48:54.960
Jeff goes like, we're all crazy, not me.

48:54.960 --> 48:56.960
And then Jeff says, shut up Leonard.

48:56.960 --> 48:58.960
And there's like this random character, shut up Leonard.

48:58.960 --> 49:00.960
I saw your art project, whatever.

49:00.960 --> 49:02.960
And he goes like, busted.

49:02.960 --> 49:04.960
And then he swims away.

49:04.960 --> 49:08.960
We're shooting coverage of Leonard and he's just an old guy that can swim

49:08.960 --> 49:10.960
and we're just making him swim forever.

49:10.960 --> 49:13.960
And I'm just like, he's not saying busted right.

49:13.960 --> 49:15.960
There's just like another take, another take.

49:15.960 --> 49:20.960
I went to the bathroom early on before I came back and like we did like 50 more takes

49:20.960 --> 49:25.960
and then eventually like Joe Russo, the director, said like, he's going to drown.

49:25.960 --> 49:31.960
And I think he got it while you were in the bathroom like on take one.

49:31.960 --> 49:35.960
And I think that he's, you've been drowning an old man for no reason,

49:35.960 --> 49:37.960
for no reason the entire time.

49:37.960 --> 49:44.960
I think you're like an Egyptian pharaoh in a Mel Gibson movie about just the end of civilization.

49:44.960 --> 49:48.960
But you know, once he drowns, nobody fucks up a take after that.

49:48.960 --> 49:51.960
I look at the rest of the pool and I go, you see that?

49:51.960 --> 49:53.960
Yeah, say busted right.

49:53.960 --> 49:55.960
You see what Kraft gets you?

49:57.960 --> 49:59.960
You follow direction.

49:59.960 --> 50:03.960
And so it turned out absolutely he nailed it on the first take.

50:03.960 --> 50:08.960
And the rest of the 50 takes, he was just inhaling too much water to get his line right.

50:08.960 --> 50:12.960
He's an old man who can swim.

50:12.960 --> 50:15.960
So, yeah, that's how I met Leonard.

50:15.960 --> 50:17.960
I was killing him.

50:17.960 --> 50:20.960
And that's the second time I saw him like because we brought him back.

50:20.960 --> 50:23.960
And I was like, so there was like Jeff.

50:23.960 --> 50:25.960
This time you're bungee jumping for this thing.

50:25.960 --> 50:28.960
They're supposed to just walk by him and he's supposed to go like,

50:28.960 --> 50:31.960
like Professor Slater says a zinger to Jeff.

50:31.960 --> 50:35.960
And then it's supposed to just land on Leonard going, ooh.

50:35.960 --> 50:39.960
And he's just, he's just there and he's like, they keep going past him and he keeps going,

50:39.960 --> 50:42.960
oh.

50:42.960 --> 50:44.960
Or, oh.

50:44.960 --> 50:45.960
Or, yeah.

50:45.960 --> 50:47.960
Everything but who.

50:47.960 --> 50:48.960
And I go up to him.

50:48.960 --> 50:49.960
He doesn't know who I am.

50:49.960 --> 50:54.960
Like he says, I just go, hey, Richard, hey, I'm a kid kid kid.

50:54.960 --> 50:57.960
Let us next take a, just go like, who.

50:57.960 --> 51:00.960
And he goes, pfft.

51:00.960 --> 51:03.960
He just looked at me and just like, like, fuck you.

51:03.960 --> 51:06.960
You know, I got from all of that like fuck you.

51:06.960 --> 51:13.460
I didn't know at the time still that he was I just I just I just what I got was

51:13.460 --> 51:19.460
fuck you and I was like I think I think he might have known that but not that I

51:19.460 --> 51:23.780
created the show I think I think you so that's my worders me that's the worst

51:23.780 --> 51:29.780
fraction of information at all I know that faced from one place which is my

51:29.780 --> 51:35.060
death I don't know but but then you know anyways who cares great scene yeah

51:35.060 --> 51:39.640
peanut peanut bar rap thanks this is the place where you laugh at the peanut

51:39.640 --> 51:45.460
bar rap watch community on Thursdays and NBC then tune in to Dan Hyman's

51:45.460 --> 51:52.000
podcast to laugh at the peanut bar rap behind the scenes of the peanut bar rap

51:52.000 --> 52:00.400
all right so I think that I think that I didn't talk to him about it I got out

52:00.400 --> 52:05.860
of my car as he dropped me off at my house last time I saw him on Friday and

52:05.860 --> 52:15.420
I said see you Sunday and he said I think he said yes and I literally haven't

52:15.420 --> 52:20.220
talked to him since was he in the green room who is he I've no idea who you're

52:20.220 --> 52:43.340
talking about is Spencer back I guess it was just

52:43.340 --> 52:57.060
I wasn't even thinking about the fact that since we last saw you you were on

52:57.060 --> 53:06.900
community and yeah yeah I was has there still I asked you this already but I

53:06.900 --> 53:11.540
haven't seen you in a couple days has there been any negative I'm very I this

53:11.540 --> 53:16.700
is what I keep racing myself for like I don't want you to be abraded and flapped

53:16.700 --> 53:23.420
you're unflappable I don't need to be flapped by being on the show yeah in the

53:23.420 --> 53:29.220
East Coast viewing there was some some people talking shit about me but it was

53:29.220 --> 53:37.020
cool because they they were right and they just had shitty weather they did

53:37.020 --> 53:41.580
no they were lame they're being what was their beef I don't know they called me

53:41.580 --> 53:49.180
beardy McGee that's that's accurate and flatter and I don't know I wouldn't say

53:49.180 --> 53:54.660
so you know you don't like the Irish connotation in that or he is wearing

53:54.660 --> 54:01.860
green yeah I'm very strongly anti-Irish my voice is so anti-Irish you're

54:01.860 --> 54:05.820
wearing green the night before St. Patrick's yeah because I've that's why

54:05.820 --> 54:09.780
I'm anti-Irish because I was always attacked in school for not fucking

54:09.780 --> 54:13.420
wearing green because apparently it's okay to touch other people without their

54:13.420 --> 54:19.940
permission you get you get pinched or punched yeah just constantly and half the

54:19.940 --> 54:23.980
time I'd be wearing green it's like where do you get off apparently on touch

54:23.980 --> 54:29.060
and other people without their permission maybe that was their way of

54:29.060 --> 54:32.900
getting a little piece of you with like kind of surreptitiously like I want to

54:32.900 --> 54:36.540
touch him this is the only angle I have I bet there were like 50 people last week

54:36.540 --> 54:41.020
being like oh I pinched that guy they probably were yeah no I was actually

54:41.020 --> 54:43.900
get you get you there's a tradition about getting pinched if you don't yeah if

54:43.900 --> 54:50.500
you don't work green on you not oh my god I'm so envious yeah seriously just

54:50.500 --> 54:55.460
tortured in school my angle was always I have green eyes and if that didn't work

54:55.460 --> 54:59.260
I said I'm wearing green green underwear and I play on their homophobia I would

54:59.260 --> 55:03.860
wear green underwear like half the time not on purpose they just all always had

55:03.860 --> 55:11.140
it doesn't it's white when you put it on you should go to the doctor

55:11.140 --> 55:18.340
we should we should we should we should we should just hang out Spencer are you

55:18.340 --> 55:23.740
excited about all the the stuff from the episode yeah so there's too much to

55:23.740 --> 55:28.820
talk to you about you you're in this in this TV show who cares so somebody call

55:28.820 --> 55:35.620
you beardy McGee so then we went to Austin we we premiered this movie that if

55:35.620 --> 55:38.820
it's not accurate to call you the star of the movie it's certainly accurate to

55:38.820 --> 55:45.500
call you the the hero of the movie so what what anything changed from that any

55:45.500 --> 55:50.740
dense in your Spencer knows no I don't know it was weird seeing that movie I

55:50.740 --> 55:57.460
had such a short beard back then no one called you beardy McGee no no

55:57.460 --> 56:03.980
certainly not beardy or work at least just a work but no it was it was really

56:03.980 --> 56:08.100
good seeing me on the movie it was really I was a lot more comfortable seeing

56:08.100 --> 56:12.300
myself in the movie than on TV I don't know seeing myself on TV I was like no

56:12.300 --> 56:16.580
this is wrong everything about this is wasn't you playing someone else rather

56:16.580 --> 56:20.500
than being yourself was that the probably had something to do with it yeah

56:20.500 --> 56:26.180
yeah that makes sense yeah I mean weird you guys none of us belong on TV TV is

56:26.180 --> 56:32.300
a crazy place for crazy people like we those people are are crazy but but I

56:32.300 --> 56:36.020
wrote a character for you that's like oh this guy's crazy you shouldn't feel out

56:36.020 --> 56:40.420
of place should feel fine so that you were protected yeah I felt protected by

56:40.420 --> 56:44.700
that role definitely but the movie on the heels of the movie did anybody did I

56:44.700 --> 56:47.980
don't know nothing nothing's nothing's really changed for me everything's

56:47.980 --> 56:53.540
changed because I don't know how much of this you knew but I for the entire time

56:53.540 --> 56:57.500
that movie like there was a certain point where I was just living in grief I

56:57.500 --> 57:02.900
was just multitasking a specific amount of my brain and my stomach for fucking

57:02.900 --> 57:08.940
grief because I was seeing cuts of the movie and I was like my life goes up

57:08.940 --> 57:13.820
and down goes I make a rape joke I don't make a rape joke I make a Rick and

57:13.820 --> 57:18.940
Morty I don't make a Rick and Morty I I'm constantly obsessed with how people

57:18.940 --> 57:23.380
think about me but I don't want to ever be dishonest I'm a narcissist but I'm

57:23.380 --> 57:30.180
honest about that blue bitty blue bitty blue I made this movie I'm in it and I'm

57:30.180 --> 57:36.060
watching cuts of it and I'm like there were dark dark dark days and I don't know

57:36.060 --> 57:39.700
how much of that you were experiencing if you were ever wondering what the fuck

57:39.700 --> 57:44.620
is this cloud is this ever gonna come over were you ever wondering how am I

57:44.620 --> 57:49.900
gonna be portrayed in this movie because you never saw anything of it I I just

57:49.900 --> 57:55.220
tried not to think about it I mean it wasn't about me like it was about you

57:55.220 --> 58:01.020
and who you are so I wasn't worried that I'd you know be a weird part of it or

58:01.020 --> 58:05.420
some part of it that I wouldn't expect I thought that what I was in was pretty

58:05.420 --> 58:10.340
pretty good and I came off as a really good guy but I didn't expect to be in it

58:10.340 --> 58:13.820
I probably didn't even expect to be in it as much as I was so I wasn't really

58:13.820 --> 58:17.020
worried about it had to be about you at a certain point it was Aaron's idea

58:17.020 --> 58:22.220
really to I remember at the pit of my despair going I'm gonna fucking kill

58:22.220 --> 58:28.340
myself like I this movie is the nail in my self-destructive cough and I finally

58:28.340 --> 58:32.500
figured out a way to make everyone hate me because I don't change there's

58:32.500 --> 58:37.420
nothing redeemable about me etc etc and I was venting all this to Aaron and

58:37.420 --> 58:42.660
Aaron said just tell Neil because I don't have any control over the editorial

58:42.660 --> 58:47.220
content but she was like just tell Neil who's struggling for a story in this

58:47.220 --> 58:51.740
movie just tell him to make it about Spencer tell tell him that the story is

58:51.740 --> 58:57.300
Spencer and leave you alone like like let you be let you be the asshole that

58:57.300 --> 59:02.020
you are or the non-asshole that you are let you just be Dan Harmon in the

59:02.020 --> 59:06.420
background as the bedrock of the whole thing and let anybody that goes through

59:06.420 --> 59:10.660
anything be the young guy that everybody likes that is undeniably going on a

59:10.660 --> 59:14.100
little journey and that was the to me that was the turning point of this thing

59:14.100 --> 59:19.260
not making me almost kill myself because I did call Neil and give him Aaron's

59:19.260 --> 59:24.100
note and the next cut I saw it was like holy shit this is gonna work I'm gonna

59:24.100 --> 59:31.220
get away with this and so we premiered it at South by Southwest and it people

59:31.220 --> 59:35.420
like it and the reviews are good and stuff like I'm yeah we should see that I

59:35.420 --> 59:37.860
read the reviews it really good I don't want to read too much because I don't

59:37.860 --> 59:41.220
really have a sense of what the movie is like but you guys like how it turned

59:41.220 --> 59:45.180
out yeah yeah it's almost like the equivalent it's like it's weird like

59:45.180 --> 59:51.620
it's like you go into a dark bar and just like like it's not I yeah I don't

59:51.620 --> 59:55.500
know what the fuck it is it's a it's it's it's got details I don't know if

59:55.500 --> 59:59.700
there are all the details that everybody wants for or needs at any given time but

59:59.700 --> 01:00:03.980
I for me like we like Spencer is like kind of the emergent hero in it but for

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:11.060
me the movie is it's ostensibly about Dan and why the eternal question why are

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:14.460
we doing this why are we going out on tour why are we making this movie the

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:19.100
guy gets fired from the show so he goes on the road and they kept asking me in

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:22.780
interviews like why are we doing this I don't know what we're doing I just think

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:26.420
it's gonna be fun and then Spencer kind of goes through an actual journey but

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:30.460
for me the movie is about you guys it's about the fans that come to the show

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:36.220
because this is everybody is an individual but it comes together as this

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.580
kind of awesome organism of people and that there's this straight-to-camera

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:45.020
interviews with with the harmonians and I've seen three cuts of it and I cry

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:48.860
every time it's like it's not like like boohoo but like it's just like some

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:53.980
really beautiful kind of human moments in there like I think it's more about the

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:58.060
people that come then about anybody up on the stage yeah they call that the

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:10.580
money shot no it's it's the I was doing a pun come joke the capillaries in your

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:20.620
cheeks dilate when fans are looking into the camera real let's let's let's get

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:34.260
airy McGathey out here

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:39.860
hello did you like the movie on I did like the movie I'm gonna steal a line

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:45.260
from a review it's a movie about finding your people so I think for that

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:50.660
reason it's it's it's great it doesn't what it's about to do it does I look I

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:56.020
look like a real bummer in it that's great but that's not really true no you

01:01:56.020 --> 01:02:03.060
just don't look like the genius and and and muse and like like person that's

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:07.220
funnier than me and the documentary should be about like which is the truth

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:12.660
well I thank you for your flattery when you when you focus the camera on me my

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:16.860
girlfriend becomes a person pushing a shopping cart and at various points I

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:22.260
take a shit on her to be funny and so it's not an accurate portrayal of our

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:25.180
relationship but it is an accurate portrayal of what an asshole boyfriend I

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:28.620
am gonna take what you're saying all the way to the bank and tell you guys that

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:37.900
they cut out me figuring out almost the way to cure cancer and almost at one

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:42.060
point there were all these people in a soup line and I stood in front of them

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:45.860
and I started delivering this like comedic speech and they all they all

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:51.660
suddenly were full they went and got job yeah there's hundreds and hundreds of

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:55.820
hours of I mean it's 600 hours of footage there's a point there I saw cuts

01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:58.780
where all of a sudden you're just following Jeff like around the city

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:02.940
and he's alone and he suddenly explains why he always every time the bus stops

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:08.420
breaks off and goes to be by himself and reads a book and they start talking

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:12.900
about his mother and you know that's all gone Jeff's just a guy in a suit in the

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.860
movie Jeff I wanted to tell you this last week I took a trip by myself to

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:21.860
Palm Springs and I really was trying to channel you when I was walking out in

01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:26.140
the city I took with me a book and I went to a Mexican restaurant and I'm like

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:31.420
I'm just like Jeff Davis is gonna read this book I got salsa all over my book

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:35.100
that doesn't surprise me a bit because I've seen you around salsa we were in

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:40.420
San Francisco a couple years ago and I've seen you're on salsa as a great name

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:45.300
for this episode we called Aaron the salsa monster because there was a salsa

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:49.220
bar in the mission at this burrito place or we were all dead we were just

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:53.220
drinking all day long it was the fight the last day of our trip we extended our

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:56.500
stay another day we all went to we all got drunk and high I went to this

01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:02.060
burrito place and there was a salsa bar was not use a little small plastic

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:05.540
ramekins they give you to put salsa this one had like kind of like like

01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:09.740
quarter-pound like tubs like like big ones that you could like like you get

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:13.660
olives that like in like a gelson or something like that and that you kept

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:17.020
going to the bar and getting more setting children like that's not an

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:20.180
exaggeration children that were near the bar going back I gotta get more salsa

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:23.580
because she was out of salsa the reason why you're out of salsa is because none

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:27.940
of it was in your mouth or on the food it was on the floor in your lap on my

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:35.100
shoe on the table I was like maybe you maybe you don't actually like the end

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:38.900
of my Palm Springs Jeff Davis trip was that like I got salsa all over my book

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:43.900
and I had had two margaritas and I I went back to my car and I took a two-hour

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:48.500
nap in my car on the street in Palm Springs exactly like a vision quest

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:53.620
where I was gonna find myself and I found myself drunk in a car so what were

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:58.540
you hoping that what happened if you if you successfully channeled me that like

01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:02.660
yeah well that's a good question what what what does happen to Jeff in those

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:10.700
moments do you go and rejoin the adjustment bureau and your friends

01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:15.900
between dimensions really quick about the movie dick over over a shot of

01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:19.740
front at Bronco down at the street down the street okay Jeff cheese who's that

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:26.020
guy think he's kidding once upon a time he goes through a portal and there's

01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:34.300
just other guys in suits that I'm pretending to read Moby Dick sounds like

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:40.620
wings of desire have you seen that great movie what you think about wings of

01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:46.020
desire I don't I don't even know what that is it was remade into an American

01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:51.300
movie starring a Nicholas Cage called City of Angels and it's these angels who

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:54.820
like to sort of go around and yeah that's what the movie is but there's a

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.300
great scene where they're like a guy like so these angels just sort of go

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:03.580
around the city unseen Berlin and like sort of Peter Falk with a spoiler is

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:06.700
that bad to say it with Peter Falk isn't this it is a spoiler yeah like Peter

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:10.820
Falk isn't it plays himself and it's it's it's awesome it's what's his name it's

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:16.300
Bruno Gans the director the German director Vin Wenders Vin Wenders it's a

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:19.780
it's a it's a beautiful wonderful movie it's an amazing movie yeah but my

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:22.700
favorite thing on the tour like the director Neil kept saying like Jeff like

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:26.660
we need a shot of you like I want to know what you do when you go away because

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:30.060
we would hit town and towns that were cool like New York or I mean most of the

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:33.380
towns we went to are big cities and cool places to go and I just kind of like to

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:37.260
go on my own grab a book and just kind of bone out look on you up and find out

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:40.740
like piece of pizza or something like that or a nice something I just spent a

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:44.140
moment like alone doing that and he kept trying to follow me around I just get

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:47.180
these calls from Neil Berkeley it's like Jeff where are you right now I'm in a

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:50.300
subway in New York going to the city like from Brooklyn can I send cameras

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:54.140
but no because we won't be able to shoot where I want to go like you won't be

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:57.980
able to clear cameras at the place I'm going to so in Chicago we finally did

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:02.020
he's like he's like Jeff we need to find out I need to I'm just curious what

01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:07.220
do you do when you go off into the night on your own and so I said I'm gonna

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:09.900
go to this place or that place if you can clear camera there what were the

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:19.180
places but nuts with a Z and the button at the manhole I used to live by the

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:24.700
manhole did you yeah but that's my second favorite name of a gay bar my

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:28.540
favorite one is the white swallow baby the white swallow is great San

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:33.180
Francisco's white swallow jackhammer was there too I like the jackhammer I

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:37.740
didn't show it jackhammer once and the entire time porn was playing behind it

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:40.940
seems like the goal of naming these places is if you're a straight guy

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:46.460
wandering in yeah you they want you to get two drinks in before you realize

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:56.020
manhole so many clues it was right under my nose oh shit it's right under my

01:07:56.020 --> 01:08:02.140
nose services the guys that are also like I didn't know let's hang out here

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:05.060
because we're already here yeah I don't know if it's still here in LA but it

01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:07.580
used to be in Silver Lake and they might be a chain I don't know but it was one

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:12.380
summer like I think it's kind of called a rough trade that's not very that sounds

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:19.700
like a gene store yeah or a saloon and gun smoke yeah ladies and gentlemen here's

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:33.660
the the proprietor of rough trade

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:45.660

cooler at home he turns the temperature up as each item is sold

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:25.620
which preserves their life yeah they call me the smooth-faced dad I think is

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:29.260
that from true detective I don't know I don't know I don't know reference that's

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:36.780
a spaghetti face yeah I kind of hope that we can do another cuz I just finished

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:40.460
but we'll get we'll get back there and I watched all of I watched all of and

01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:48.260
really liked true detective right yeah that's it maybe maybe we could do

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:56.940
another little of another Pakistan a hey and I was really confused about which

01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:07.980
one of us was okay for those of you who can't come from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Pacific

01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:15.860
time through a cool website called Kogo it's Kogo.tv we'll be streaming a KO

01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:24.140
COGO we'll be streaming a QVC style show with Dan and guest co-host selling

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:28.460
things via that and it's not going to be an auction it'll be like here's Dan's

01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:31.940
Dan's book because I found a few extra copies of you'll be perfect when you're

01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:37.380
dead only only a few but Dan will be

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:42.220
hawking those view via the QVC thing and another thing that we'll be selling

01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:46.980
will be Jeff's notes for D&D and then also why write down such words as

01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:51.700
stubborn arts and that might be the whole entry for that show and all the

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:57.340
money goes to 826LA every every cent goes to 826LA and it's like a kids

01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:05.540
education thing right they're trying to make space aids no it's great it's an

01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:09.700
organization that supports supports kids learning how to write so it's very

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:13.620
appropriate for the show it doesn't it doesn't I don't know enough about it but

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:18.420
it sounds like the thing that I've always thought in my head needs to that I

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:22.740
would the charity that I would be interested in kids kids need to

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:26.980
it started by I forget his name heartbreaking work of stagger David

01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:32.180
Eggers it's his it's his charity and yeah so this is you know I've got stop

01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:39.620
writing kids well that's a different message but we can still team up yeah it

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:44.540
seems so anti what you guys are trying to do though I just read in defamers that

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:48.340
we're doing a prod a secret project together and I think that should be it

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:53.380
stop writing kids let's let's stop start writing kids together so your charity is

01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:58.940
just like telling kids like really this is what you want to do it's where is the

01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:07.420
story structure flagstones yeah it's about how the spec script is really dead

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:14.500
showing kids and show it you show them like 16 millimeter films of like writers

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:23.540
dying alone yeah exactly coming by also original art by Jeff and Dan and

01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:26.660
myself I don't know Jeff if you remember but when we were first hanging out we

01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:30.100
got drunk and painted some things we'll be selling those all right sounds great

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:38.580
also I was drunk I'll double check with Spencer but also old character sheets

01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:46.020
and lots of lots of stuff so it could be Spencer stuff for sale anybody else

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:53.340

want like Mountain Dew kickster or some shit I want Toyota I want fucking you

01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:56.540
know what you mean here's the angle in South by Southwest I learned a lot about

01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:59.460
marketing because people drive you around in cars that were like Chevy just

01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:02.660
sponsoring like free rides you get in a car and they kind of required to kind of

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:06.460
give you a pitch about their car and I was sat in a car with these gals that are

01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:12.460
Mountain Dew like marketing people Spencer you're a big Mountain Dew guy

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:18.020
yeah I'm wearing a Mountain Dew shirt right now see no shit see like Spencer should

01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:21.660
do a Mountain Dew piece every like once in a while I think it just did it looks

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:28.420
like an upside-down mountain it's true like a reflection in Mountain Dew of a

01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:32.980
mountain that's what your beard looks like it's like that too Spencer I mean

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:37.140
let's just do I mean it's not to put in a spot but you're an improviser you're a

01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:42.740
Dungeon Master extraordinaire and extreme I think you know and it's an extreme

01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:48.140
drink oh yeah could we could we maybe hear a Mountain Dew spot just kind of

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:57.020
riff one for us right now should it be like a weird D&D yeah yeah yeah yeah

01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:08.660
climbing out of the pits of Skaldor your thirst it needs quenching as you rise to the top there's a vicious ogre the

01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:15.380
kind of ogre that doesn't just take traditional hydration to defeat but the

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:27.980
electrolyte caffeine infuse fusion of Mountain Dew code red code red and yes yes

01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:33.340
I would say I would say if we could go back the ogre's name should be thirst

01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:39.900
right oh fuck I mean hey whoa whoa if we're gonna write this thing yeah it'll

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:45.900
be Citizen Kane but in the meantime I'm trying to make money my request is

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:51.380
Spencer does a an ad for this Sunday's charity garage I was gonna say first you

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:55.020
might want to do and like an anti-Mountain Dew ad you know what I mean so

01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:58.300
that they so that they don't just feel like they got free publicity so that so

they can know they would know we'll unleash oh yeah valuable taste to what

01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:08.940
they'll get if they don't be happy to drop one of the Mountain Dew ads if you

01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:12.060
guys want to play ball yeah this is what it looks like if you're on our site

01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:15.260
this is what it looks like if you're not let them know that you can bring the

01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:19.900
sunshine you can also bring the rain bring the rain bring the rain

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:23.820
maybe an upbeat I don't even know what an anti-Mountain Dew

01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:30.540
climbing up the pits of Skaldor you need to slake your thirst but with

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:36.820
something that's not gonna shrink your testicles where else can you turn but

01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:39.820
see you're amiss

01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:49.220
all right right now you're covered all right you hear us Mountain Dew I'm sure

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:53.860
you've been warned I'm sorry and now to potentially bring the room down can we

hear an ad for 826 sell a Harmonone all right yes yes give us an ominous D&D

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:05.820
advertisement climbing out of the pits of extra money you have lying around you

01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:10.540
enter a lair full of knick-knacks thrown aside by people more famous than

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:17.660
yourself but can you truly clasp crap the grasp some of their glory and fame

01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:25.180
just by owning some of their trinkets and items yes yes give me your money

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:34.020
all right and if you could do an anti one of those too that way

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:42.020
just to balance it out yeah you got you got now just just to kind of even

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:47.900
things out as we've been doing with you Spencer Mitch I want you to do an ad

01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:55.660
for stamps.com but as as Robin Williams I really don't know how this idea that I

01:19:55.660 --> 01:20:06.620
do Robin Williams start oh you want to lick something but it only cost 15 cents

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:22.700
it's a pretty nasty prostitute all right all right okay boy we're on a roll

01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:32.500
this is bigger my cavalcade of stars I mean it seems almost incongruous to go

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:36.500
into but Spencer shall we dispense some character sheets and maybe play some D&D

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:40.380

01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:44.740
being back mean that you we you want to play a little chapter of D&D yeah sure

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:48.020
okay all right I don't know what anything means we played some at the

01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:53.700
Harmontown one well yeah we did that was yeah but that was like the locals

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:58.300
yeah they don't know what's happening all right assume the same Harmontown do

01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:02.980
you feel do you feel refreshed from your hiatus from yeah I mean I've never I've

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:08.780
never dm'd a game that many sessions without taking a break before so it was

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:13.540
starting to show oh no I know oh I'm kidding I know it all it all well you're

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:19.500
absolutely right I'll be the first which is worse it's cool it's cool Mitch I

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:28.660
respect your opinion as a professional so I don't get why that was a joke it's

01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:32.620
it's funny I don't know sometimes some things don't have to be jokes to be funny

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:38.380
believe me if my house payments are dependent on it

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:45.780
what I just thought damn it's gonna go into a monologue about paying house

01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:48.900
paying house payments with bad jokes it just seems like it's about Mountain Dew

01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:51.100
now

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:57.940
tricking people into thinking you have insight you your mansion gets bigger and

01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:06.380
bigger you invested in a cartoon studio which will be your undoing that's quark

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:12.180
that's it well I yeah I'm yeah starboards

01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:27.180
there's Chris de Burgh's character sheet okay yeah no we're doing well we're

01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:33.340
doing fine what is Mitch still playing the the Avenger or was it was yeah I

01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:38.140
guess I guess Mitch should should reprise his role as my Falcon yeah that's great

01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:41.700
because I just kind of hang out and just kind of that's good on your shoulder yeah

01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:51.540
soar over me cast a shadow on me let me look up to you works on so many levels

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:58.580
all right all right so are we good to go we poised sure especially I'm gonna go

01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:02.740
I'm gonna go David Bowie labyrinth hallucination theme on your things just

01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:14.540
shake it up a bit all right all right last time on Harmontown after being

01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:19.580
released from skeleton bondage and finding the Marsh Minotaur our heroes

01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:25.180
began to plot their escape together with the Minotaur's aid the gang trekked

01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:30.860
back to the hole from which they fell and using his teleportation cape Sharpie

01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:37.180
quickly found himself topside the rest of the adventurers weren't so lucky and

01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:42.700
and found they had to climb up Meredith the Minotaur's crazy ridiculous ladder

01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:49.300
as they ascended they were beset by their greatest fears boomers long-term

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:54.860
relationships and not having the appropriate crafts more rain fell from

01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:59.620
the ladder in terror but eventually the gang faced their fears and climbed to

01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:04.380
freedom and then they all gathered around a fire while Sharpie sang an old

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:09.700
dwarven spiritual but what would they do now in the harsh unforgiving frozen

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:15.340
wastelands of the north and one of their skull curses let's find out this time

01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:22.180
hopefully on an all-new episode of stuff they have at Harmontown

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:28.540
with a soundtrack that's getting a little Cagney and Lacey right there at the end

01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:33.900
that Cagney and Lacey part kicked in right at the right time too

01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:38.300
Spencer has an innate sense of that kind of stuff I want to make a bit about

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:44.500
how I want Spencer to be at my bedside recapping my blackout drugs but I know

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:48.580
I probably made that bit during some blackout drunk at some point and you

01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:52.780
know he's been doing it for like three years yeah you don't remember that you

01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:59.740
do not remember that every night Spencer skull curses I don't know I think I

01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:03.780
called them skull curses the last time I did an intro but yeah I remember when

01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:06.860
you got a you were you were on under court and then you're like you got a

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:10.220
you got to kill the Marsh Minotaur and then you're like what if we don't and

01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:14.820
then they're like you got a you're gonna fucking die all right gotcha yeah so we

01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:18.660
did it all right so are we with we're with merit meritus the minotaur right

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:22.660

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:35.580
ridiculously tall ladder she she starts pulling the ladder out of the hole and

01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:38.980

01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:38.620
it all right fine but can we promise once we're done we'll come back and grab

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:44.380
my dick I don't think we can promise that only we had being the only we had a

01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:50.300
being that could fly down and grab Falcon adventure down after the that's so

01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:54.380
funny cuz I just went down there and there was this kind of thick but short

01:27:54.380 --> 01:28:05.420
worm oh my god was it circumcised I'm so sorry what did you do with it well

01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:11.700
what do birds do with words oh my god were you the early bird

01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:19.580
did you get my morning what the good news is it was fine when I vomited into

01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:25.260
my children's mouths adventure you have children yeah yeah okay yeah

01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:29.060
bearing the lead let's focus on I mean we just never had to talk about our

01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:33.580
personal lives no I know I know I know I want to all the time and I feel like I

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:40.660
oh Jacob is 11 okay did he eat my dick 11 year old

01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:46.260
he regurged he really ate re swallowed walk just keep an eye out on there's two

01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:50.660
by the way he wants to write really wants to write he wrote it he wrote a

01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:54.060
community you wrote a spec community I think it was very good but would you

01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:58.700
mind reading it absolutely no problem yeah I mean it's like a season's book

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:04.380
forest back yeah yeah yeah it was heavy on Jonathan Banks what season was that

01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:10.180
that's this one oh it's this one yeah okay so he's he's watching him I guess

01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:19.460
all right so we're leaving the dick know that at this point really the dick

01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:23.420
has been I in game time I think the dick's been severed so long it doesn't

01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:28.100
attach but you're thinking like a modern person like it like my Falcon says

01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:33.340
it's you have more more chance of growing magically a new dick than you do

01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:37.180
have like surgically doing anything with that yeah I have a backpack and a

01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:42.700
sewing kit but I don't have the dick no I know if you guys want to go back

01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:50.340
down that magic ladder nobody he said it's lousy there's no dick no dick I go

01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:54.100
up to Meredith I say Meredith look here's the deal we were there was a

01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:58.660
contract out in your life basically and we were we're supposed to kill you but

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:02.420
you saved our lives more or less you got us out of the pit we're not gonna do

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:07.380
that good we're gonna take you back to the to the people and I mean is that the

01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:11.100
way to do this well we also have what did they do they cast a spell on us or

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:15.500
something our souls very souls if we if we don't if we don't if you're not dead

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:20.060
within a certain period of time like we we basically die we're fine with that

01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:24.700
because I fucking hate authority I'd rather die than do anything that these

01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:28.020
assholes want me to do but I'm just wondering if you can think of help us

01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:35.100
think of any solution to this all right terrific of all the people that be a

01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:43.260
hero for ever on your souls yeah that's like a timer I don't know man you'd

01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:47.660
have to you know deal with something someone crazy magic to try and knock

01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:53.020
that off are you crazy magic no no but you know somebody no no yeah you do I

01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:57.460

01:30:57.460 --> 01:31:02.580
magics can you're right okay we got to get these bombs spell bombs diffused from

01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:06.420

Terragon of virtue to get to lift to Christopher Spell too because it sounds

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:29.260
right to me I've got a couple things going on yeah but one of those is just

01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:33.540
getting lower on the top we are not gonna be able to do all of these we can

01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:37.460
Meredith do you know where Paradise is can we use ladder get us to Paradise

01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:41.420

01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:48.140
don't know where it is it floats around does it exist it's it's on this

01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:52.900
physical plane yes above us yes we just have to find it yes okay what kind of

01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:57.100
creatures do business with them there but they must have imports and exports I

01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:02.340

faster all right so I fly up I fly up I have no sheet or anything but I just

01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:57.220
fly up and I I'm communicating with with one of these earthbound creatures yeah

01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:05.500
yeah your friend whoa what is that whoa what the heck is this thing is it a

01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:10.380
dick paradise you look for paradise it's like a this is like a it's almost like a

01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:18.660
really nice condo development paradise gardens it says but that could that be

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:27.780
it yeah they have a 24-hour health club yeah so you see that you with your your

01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:34.860
your hawk eyes that's just floating in midair apparently you see that and then

01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:38.500
you you feel like you should return and report what you saw

01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:44.940
guys my hawk says he saw a city that could be paradise but he fucks around a

01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:50.500
lot like it could be a bit too I can't tell it's not a bit no it's not a bit

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:54.820
it may but it does look like a condo development how high off the ground is

01:33:54.820 --> 01:34:05.540
it you know I can do it in wing flaps it's like 28 I don't even know like 28

01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:12.300
hundred a wing flaps what is that what is that even translated to Spencer how

01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:18.500
many how high is it you look to 28 we flaps or whatever high and you see

01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:24.500
nothing you wonder what the natural landscape and environment and temperature

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:32.100
normally is for a hawk it's probably not freezing so it's not crazy higher is

01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:38.740
or he's nuts because he's crazy high or there was a there was a headwind or

01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:43.620
there's a hand have you ever flown I mean did you know anything about it no how

01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:46.740
many flaps do you think it but I would say all right if you want a number I

01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:52.540
would say it's about 200 my hawk has lost it we got a we got a just

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:56.980
traipse across this fucking tundra until we either die or come to a place where

01:34:56.980 --> 01:35:03.420
somebody can help us get find paradise yeah what a terrible Cocoa nearby

01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:12.220
Cocoa's here that's how I call her now I jump on Cocoa when I and I ride off

01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:20.700
trying to scout alright you know in what direction all all so just like a

01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:27.140
rapid slowly increasing circle like a spiral seems inefficient but go for it

01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:32.580
there she is oh there she is there she is

01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:40.900
oh there she is a little further now uh-huh away much farther each time away

01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:47.700
from the hole mm-hmm it's my the way I live my life away from the hole towards

01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:56.140
like think about it the like the place where the we're where I would think the

01:35:56.140 --> 01:36:03.780
most tarragon would be maybe like the greenest north northeast northeast you

01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:10.900
head northeast for some time you don't really see anything until until you might

01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:21.900
see something yeah until you happen upon a brown sack he should take that Adam

01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:29.380
Goldberg's ringer which was his mom saying you're okay Adam Goldberg's ring

01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:33.860
tone is an older woman's voice saying just tell him you're doing the best you

01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:40.140
can stay true to yourself if they don't like you then they shouldn't have been

01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:44.060
your friends in the first place I don't think Adam needs to be told to be true to

01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:53.260
himself if anything he's got that down exactly I'm sorry I find a brown sack

01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:58.980
yep brown sack and you see it from your horse it's one of the only things that's

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:07.700
anywhere in the snow okay I dismount I give cocos me in a very quick brush just

01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:17.140
to let her know that I still have her in mind and I approach the sack and I I

01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:22.660
inspect it it looks like it has a writing on it it does have writing on it

01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:30.300
it's written in gnomish though it says Mountain Dew if you guys are do you read

01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:34.540
gnomish how we pay the bills I read I read Elvis okay so you can't read it

01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:38.780
some gnomish letters that you can't understand well it's definitely a sack

01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:50.580
okay I pick up the sack I put it on cocoa and I return to the party that

01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:56.660
happens so anyways that's how you tie a rope

01:37:56.660 --> 01:38:04.940
10 cc I think it's a Tennessee yeah I was just finishing my famous doctor

01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:14.780

spatial differential like like if you reach your hand all the way down into

01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:54.260
the bag does it like Mary Poppins bag is that what you're asking yes it's like

01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:57.740
Mary Poppins bag it's like that would have high knowledge of magic well okay

01:41:57.740 --> 01:42:03.060

01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:20.460
wonderful bag I've never seen Mary Poppins but what does it mean what does it

01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:25.100
mean it just means that with it where everything can fit it's bigger than it

01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:29.860
yeah it's like a bag of hold it yeah infatude what did you say I may have

01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:34.340
said that I don't know what it's like in there did you didn't Mulrainee didn't you

01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:39.140

01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:45.660
dirt out I don't want you to tell me what to do I reach into the bag and grab

01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:50.100
the earth that she feels yeah you can dig in with your finger nails it's not

01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:54.980
like a loose soil it's like packed dirt ground but you can get a bit grab so I

01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:59.620
pull out again does anyone have detect magic obviously it's a magic thing yeah

01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:05.180
so detected I don't have detect magic I it's been detected it's a fucking bag

01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:13.820
that doesn't go by bag rules so you reach in it there's magic bag save a

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:19.780
spell I pull out some of this dirt and want to hold it up look at it it looks

01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:27.420
like dirt I throw it and I spit and I I twirl I twirl around into the tundra

01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:32.620
I poke my leg about my dad I poke my head confident in my knowledge of that

01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:43.820
that built Bill Martin he's like the HBO guy but I poke my head going I poke my

01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:48.220
head in the back you poke your head into the bag and you find yourself in a

01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:52.580
warm city bathed in golden glowing light guys I poke my head in the back I

01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:57.740
think we found paradise in a bag it's in a bag paradise in a bag get in there can

01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:01.700
we fit in there that's I thought that was if you want to find paradise you go

01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:10.660
to Bill Martigan's let's go in guys wait can we fit in there yeah we get

01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:15.180
a whole city it's a whole it's a whole beautiful city in here but if we go in

01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:20.500
there then we're in a bag that anyone yahoo can just find like we did is it

01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:25.860
should we should we first find a place to secure this bag my recommendation is

01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:31.820
we dig a three by three hole we're talking in Minecraft terms like we put

01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:37.220
it we put it down at the bottom and then we all go into it well no one can

01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:39.860
maybe we should put your whole life you've been trying to get away from

01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:47.140
holes right I mean isn't it I don't think I'm just that's a reprise that's not

01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:54.140
my take someone died you called back somebody nobody nobody yeah one of us

01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:58.580
could wait while while the rest of us went out and I mean this bag is sitting

01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:01.180
out in the middle of the time yeah who's gonna what's the worst they're gonna do

01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:03.660
with it they're gonna stick their hand in it and they're gonna get in a big

01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:07.580
argument about what it is come in or they'll leave it there it's like a

01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:10.860
portal probably right maybe it's a portal it's not really doesn't have any

01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:15.500
to do with what you don't stay in the bag yeah maybe how do we get out of the

01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:19.820
bag that we have that ladder we should use the ladder so that we can climb back

01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:25.500
out of the bag okay the ladder of fears I volunteer to go into guys yeah guys I'm

01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:30.740
gonna I volunteer to go into this bag and God devil may care why don't we send

01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:34.460
you and the bird because the bird can fly and fly back out of the bag okay

01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:39.740
