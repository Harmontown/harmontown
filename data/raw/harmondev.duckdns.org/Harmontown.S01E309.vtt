00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm your Comptroller Jeff Davis. Glad to be back in town.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
It is November 5th, 2018 and Harmontown is now in session.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
We're going to start things off in a slightly different fashion.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
A little bit of a departure from our normal intros before I introduce your Game Master and your Mayor.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
Let's please bring out the Solid Me Undies Dancers!

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Yeah.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
You're Game Master Spencer Crittenden, everybody.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
And the Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Thank you.

01:03.000 --> 01:18.000
Me onesies, me onesies, me onesies, me undies as onesies, head to toe, wearing me undies the way you know,

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
but now the way you've never known them.

01:21.000 --> 01:37.000
Me undies are growing from your shoulders to your groanum and your ankleum, soft as regular me undies, but hovering your body, which raises questions.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
I'm wearing an undershirt right now and regular me undies under the me onesies.

01:43.000 --> 01:57.000
But if I wasn't wearing me undies underneath my me onesies, I have to wonder if I would just be rocking a constant, agitated, hard on.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
You're a stocking fetishist.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Well, look, everyone's a soft material dragged across your cocks fetishists.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Everyone.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
I'm not going to segue into a wrap about this.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Everyone's a having cloth draped across your crock, apologist.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Not apologist.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Fetishist.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I'm not defensive about any of my fetishes.

02:26.000 --> 02:39.000
I'm just saying, like, I'm just saying, for me to say, look, we all know that the me undies material is made from a material, a space age, but what is it called, a replenishable?

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Completely sustainably sourced.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Space age fabric that's three times softer than cotton.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
We're talking about micro-model.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Micro-model.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
And I got excited about me socks.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Oh, yeah.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Turns out me socks are made of cotton.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
It's three times less soft than micro-model.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I can see why they were hesitant.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
They never sent the me socks.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
And meanwhile, I was worried, like, well, what if the me socks are also three times softer than cotton?

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Is this going to turn into an Ed Wood situation for me?

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
Because I'm a fan of women in comfortable fabrics.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
And what if I wanted to take upon myself there?

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
What if I got a taste of it and was like, you know what?

03:25.000 --> 03:33.000
What if this awakens something in me to paraphrase Dean Pelton from my hit show community?

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
But I'm draped head to toe in luxurious micro-model.

03:39.000 --> 03:48.000
For the non-stream subscriber, Dan and Spencer are wearing what can only be described as hoody to toe onesies right now.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
This looks like Christmas morning at...

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I assume these are called me onesies, right?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I hope so.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Did you coin that, or is that what they're actually for?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
I don't know.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
I don't know.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Probably.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Did I coin it?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
I mean, yeah.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Exactly.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I mean, they probably had a long time to think about it.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Anyways, they're a sponsor, but look, I mean, we don't...

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
If Black and Decker sponsors the show, we're not going to come out here and drill...

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
That would be amazing.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Now, Spencer...

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
That sounds like fun, though.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
We should do that.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Well, maybe we would do it, and maybe that would be fun.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Because that sounds great.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
But if it were worse, we wouldn't, because we have integrity.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Right.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Spencer, are you wearing anything underneath your me onesie?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Oh, yeah.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Clothes.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
So you have a full outfit underneath your me onesie?

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I'm wearing a three-piece suit.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
I have the feeling that you're actually not wearing anything under that me onesie.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
No, no.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
It's legal.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
I wonder about my nipples, because I'm wearing an undershirt, which I don't know if I would or wouldn't...

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
I wonder about your nipples, too, Dan.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
It's like, what if I had micromodal encasing my nipples?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
It's not bad.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Every time I rolled over in bed, it was sliding across it.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
I don't know.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Why don't Spencer and I talk for a bit?

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
You go backstage, just robe, and put your onesie on without anything on.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
No, no.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Not without...

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
No, that's not...

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
That's...

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
No.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
What are you afraid of?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I'm concerned about...

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
The show being bad.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
I was about to say, I'm worried about what they're afraid of, but I don't want to go there because

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
then you're going to go, what are you afraid of?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Right, people?

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
And everyone's going to go, we're not afraid of anything.

05:38.000 --> 05:46.000
I'm afraid of what is a salt, whether they asked for it or not.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
How about this?

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
I don't want them watching to see whether or not my little tiny fucking paneling nail

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
cock starts to twitch and...

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
There comes a point when entertainment is worth no ticket price.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
What about this?

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Leave your me undies under your me onesies on, but take the shirt off.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Just the shirt.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Let's do a nipple experiment on your me onesies.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Just a nipple experiment.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Let's talk...

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
There's just so much to talk about.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
It's such a crucial time right now, guys.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
I mean, by the time this actually drops as a podcast, the time will be over.

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
But right now, it's such an important time to let your voice be heard.

06:31.000 --> 06:40.000
I'm talking about making sure that you leave a comment under a famous person's Instagram.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
Letting them know why you don't vote.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
How dare Judd Apatow post a reminder that it's time to vote.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
You don't let your voice be heard explain to him why democracy doesn't work anymore.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
He's asking for it.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
And more importantly, what if...

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
What if you didn't say anything?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Oh, no.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Oh, my God.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
The system would walk all over you.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Famous people would remind everyone to vote.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Everyone would vote whether they wanted to or not

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
for whoever the fuck they wanted to.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
You have to let freedom ring.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
This is your one chance to lend your voice to an outcry

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
without risking your voice actually becoming a part of anyone else's voice

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
because this is about you, after all.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
Please write a three-paragraph theme under everyone's Instagram.

07:44.000 --> 07:52.000
How long, Alyssa Milano, must we live under the cruel tyranny of me following you on Instagram?

07:52.000 --> 07:59.000
What do you mean, rock the vote, Sebastian Cabot?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Is he still...

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Is his Instagram still alive?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Yeah.

08:04.000 --> 08:11.000
I'm like, you know, everybody look, our culture has obviously become about, you know,

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
as everybody knows, like when I was in high school, we would have a thing, a Milwaukee.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
You, like, stand in the parking lot of the McDonald's.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
And Jerry's...

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Or it's a stranger, it's probably a stranger because otherwise you wouldn't do this.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
But somebody's Camaro goes by and they go...

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
And they peel their tires.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
And then what do you do in response to the tires peeling,

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
regardless of how many people are around you and how much they value their eardrums,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
this Camaro has committed a crime.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
So now your duty as a champion of the people and their peace and quiet is to go...

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Ew, you're so cool!

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
And then probably possibly maybe someone who heard you do that could open their apartment window

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
and go, hey, some people have to work in the morning.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
And then maybe someone who lives on the roof of that person's building could be like,

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
it must be nice to have a job!

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
Says the pigeon master.

09:14.000 --> 09:21.000
The weird off-brand crow archetype who emerged with the spirit of pigeons

09:21.000 --> 09:29.000
because he wasn't quite very wrongfully murdered.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
It's endemic to our culture.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
Social media has only exasperated this feeling that if you just let a day go by

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
without letting people know how fucking unique you are,

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
a landslide might happen of mediocrity, unremarkability.

09:46.000 --> 09:53.000
You might get subsumed in just mayonnaise and like...

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
You'll wake up tomorrow and you'll be like, I should have said something yesterday.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
It's probably not true.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
I think if anything, isn't it nice that the celebrities now are simply saying vote?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
They're not saying...

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Because they really do just want you to vote.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
Here's a spare thought for some of these people that are asking you to remind you to vote.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
They maybe even know that you're not going to vote.

10:23.000 --> 10:34.000
They're simply making one last fucking deal with whatever deity they worship.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
I gotta say something so I can sleep like a baby.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Remember Pontius Pilate?

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
He was like...

10:43.000 --> 10:51.000
Nobody remembers Pontius Pilate harder than my personal trainer.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
It was really hard on him personally.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
He was surprised.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
He was like, I think I'm going to get it.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
It's possible that someone that says to you,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
by the way, don't forget tomorrow's Waddle-a-day,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
that before you go, you know what?

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Here's the thing about that.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
I'm not going to do it because here's why.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
You might be talking to the one person left who's still talking to you.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
You might be shooting a messenger.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
Cody and I were watching...

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
We were listening to a podcast about...

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
It was another horror podcast with some horror narrative.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
In a lot of these stories, people will...

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
They go through a ghost story and it'll resolve in...

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
What are you laughing at?

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
Don't tell me I'm not dressed the way...

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I'm just saying.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
I don't know whether wearing jammies during a tirade helps or hurts.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
It definitely is good.

12:02.000 --> 12:09.000
We look like spokesmodels for a new kind of gum drop from Europe, right?

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
Muchenglubans.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
People like us are like, give me some of them.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Muchenglubans.

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
Miwonsi should come out with a gubernatorial brand of Miwonsi.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
It's a suspender so you could tuck your thumbs into it.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
What is with you millennials and hoods?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Oh, boy.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
Why are you millennials so hood-accepting?

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
They're good.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Wear a hat, you jack-offs.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
No one has ever done anything bad wearing a hood.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
Would a Generation X invest too much in peripheral vision and...

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Fuck you, space children.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
It's hard to... You can't see on the...

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
What the hell's going on over there?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Some guy buying all the hats, that's what's going on.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
You fools.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
You're too hood-happy.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
You're a bunch of hood-drunk hologram kids.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
Dan, keep your hoodie on and recite the Federalist Papers for us.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
See how much water that holds.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
We, the Federalists, bring upon this paper,

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
the Union of Two Governments,

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
the Federale and the Federolum.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Yeah, I can't even keep track of it.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
You can't do it, you can't do it.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
You gotta wear a weird beaver top hat.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Anyways, oh, so we were listening to a ghost story on a podcast

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
and ghost stories, they often...

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
They oftentimes will...

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
There'll be like a ghost.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
And then if it's...

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
And there'll be three acts, there'll be like a story.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
And if it's gonna be like a happy ghost story,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
like, oh, and then we get rid of the ghost,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
a lot of times it'll involve burning.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
We're gonna burn down the house,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
and I got a can of gasoline that says,

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
this is never gonna happen to anyone else.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
And I'm always like, wait, you don't get that.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
You don't have that in ghost writing

14:04.000 --> 14:10.000
of dooming a ghost to haunt a charred pile of briquettes?

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
Well, ghosts are inherently flammable.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
You're burning the ghost to death.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Nobody's saying the ghost is gonna burn,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
but I think there's an assumption in some of these stories

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
that if you just burn down the house

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
where somebody got murdered or molested,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
that the ghost is gonna go finally.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Yeah, no, it's done.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Like, I was attached to the wood, like a termite.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Well, no, I mean, how do we know it's not like GPS?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
That's the spot.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Right, you know?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
And if you burn the house down,

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
you're actually dooming the ghost to, like, float around.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
And then I was making that observation to Cody,

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
and then Cody said, we were high.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
And then Cody said, this isn't gonna be...

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
You guys are gonna take no delight in this,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
but sometimes things make you so happy

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
you just gotta try to share them.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
And then Cody said, well, maybe it's like a firehouse ghost.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
And then when she said that, I was like,

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
oh, are you doing, like, a play on words?

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
Like, because you're evoking the famous phrase

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
that I've never heard called a firehouse ghost?

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
And she's like, what? No.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
I'm saying, like, well, maybe it starts to haunt the firehouse.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
And I'm like, wait, so a firehouse ghost isn't an idiom?

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
Like, it's not an expression,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
because it definitely should be.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
And she's like, no, yeah, no, it's not an idiom.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
And she's like, no, yeah, no, I'm saying, like,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
maybe it was like a firehouse ghost.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
It just, like, leaps off the page as, like, an actual expression.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Especially right now, a firehouse ghost

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
it's sort of related to shooting the messenger.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
It's like, whoa, man, listen,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
it's like if you're protesting together

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
and you're like, fuck, we don't want Nazis to take over America.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Fuck that.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
And then someone tears you and goes, excuse me,

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
are your boots gluten-free?

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
And you're like, fuck you, bitch.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Fuck, bitch, I don't beg your pardon.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
And they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, guys,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
you're haunting the firehouse.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
You're frightening the only people

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
that are available to frighten.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
Nobody that we're trying to fight

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
gives a fuck what you're talking about.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Get your signs back up in the air

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
and stop being firehouse ghosts.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Oh.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Anyways, well, I didn't mean to make the example political.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I just thought that it was a fun link.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I spent the last 45 seconds

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
trying to think of a song by the band Firehouse

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
and I couldn't think of any.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Ghost.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Man, you're kind of haunting the firehouse right now, man.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Like, who cares if he used the wrong pronoun?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Like, he's totally on your side.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Firehouses haunt themselves, bro.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Well, actually, you know, like...

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Put the hose down, man.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I still like to imagine like firefighters,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
like, that's just the thing they have to deal with all the time.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
They're like, look, I mean, if we were going to let

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
firehouse ghosts like scare us out of the firehouse,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
we wouldn't be very good firemen.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Fire people, so.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Or is that a Ghostbusters reference because they,

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Ghostbusters work outside of a fire station.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Right, well, that's a dumb dot to connect.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Let's move on.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
You should be ashamed of yourself.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Oh, oh, I took it too far, huh?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
I like it.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
It's just a, it's just in a barrel now.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Like, oh, Ghostbusters in the firehouse.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Couple of firehouse ghosts.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
There was a movie where a firehouse was haunted.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Yeah, but it was a comedy in 1983.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
It's not like...

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Just Jeff.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Let's uh...

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
If you think that you're wearing relaxed jammies around me,

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
would you any sort of moral high ground?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I just feel more empowered.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I'm like, fuck you, buddy.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
What, are you wearing a suit?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Yeah, how much, yeah.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
What'd you pay for it?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Don't even have to tell me.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Your comfort.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Oh.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
I don't, I don't, I make no compromises.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I'm cloaked in Modal.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
I'm talking to a guy who won't even wear his,

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
me onesie without wearing other clothes underneath it.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
You can't even...

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Take off that shirt.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Get the nipple experiment.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
You can't even have a party or shower with a beautiful woman

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
without taking your jeans off.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Yeah, that's a weird science reference, motherfucker.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Because Levy didn't bring me my phone,

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
I'll take my shirt off while I grab my phone

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
if you guys think you can handle it.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I don't.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
I don't think we can.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
The reigns of Apollo's chariot for long enough

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
that the earth is not scorched

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
and the seasons don't change.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I don't think we can do it.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
I just think it's worth the risk.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Not even the risk, it's worth the damage.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
All right.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
What Dan doesn't know is that we have background,

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
like backstage cameras.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Let's put those up on the big screen.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
All right, Chris, Bo Ruff.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
For $5 a month, you can watch Dan Harmon take his clothes off.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Oh, look, there's his asshole.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Spencer, what's your stance on hoodies?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
You have hoodie up right now.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I'm loving this.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I was saying that it reminds me of the Santa ornament

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I had at my house that was just, like,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
carved out of a wooden rod.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
It just delights me that I look like a weird red druid.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Oh, no.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Oh.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Proof.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
So defiant.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Is it awakening something?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
It came back out like James Coburn.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Well, I had to keep it on zip,

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
like the sort of broken-spirited porn actress

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
that I've become.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
Like, see, I swallowed it.

20:01.000 --> 20:07.000
Does that satisfy the fucking parameters of your porn site?

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
Can I get my fucking clothes on and go to Best Buy now?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Does Best Buy still exist?

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
I'm at Costco.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I can see...

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I think I can see one of your nipples right now.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I think I can see one of them kind of...

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Yeah, they're probably getting super hard.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
But this is an advertisement for Meundee's new Mewenzie,

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
because I'm telling you, you should be afraid of the comfort.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
This comfort, yeah.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Comfort that will...

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
What are you doing?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Come on. Now, this is...

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
That's not...

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
This is becoming problematic.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
That's not...

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
His nipples are just fucking, like,

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
the Eiffel Tower is on top of his chest.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
That's gonna happen in life.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
There are normal nipples that may be extraordinarily excited

20:53.000 --> 21:00.000
by a fabric that is inordinately soft.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Do you think that's a plus or a minus for these...

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
Like, on your Yelp review of these things,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
are they too exciting for your nipples?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
No, not too. That's what I'm saying.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
It's an advertisement for...

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I'm saying, like, hey, man...

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
You know, like, you think of, like,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
they'll be up like a candy bar advertisement,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
and they'll go like,

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
oh, careful, it might taste so good that you get fired, you know?

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Yeah.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Yeah.

21:24.000 --> 21:30.000
It's like, oh, these pajamas will make your dick explode.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
People are gonna order them.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
They're gonna be like, well, let's find out.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
I'll take that bet.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah, I didn't stop eating Cheetos when I found out

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
they were dangerously cheesy.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Yeah.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Or like, you know, like, old movie,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
old horror movies that go like,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
there's health insurance available at the door

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
in case you have a heart attack from, you know,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
a goblin coming out.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Yeah, that makes sense.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
It's good advertising.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Speaking of goblins, are you excited about this next season

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
of Harmon Quest?

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Oh, yeah.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
You guys can come to taping if you want.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
It's next week.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
I tell them.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Yeah, I am.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Dan and I are actually in the show.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
You guys can come if you want to.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Okay, cool.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Yeah.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
All right.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
The only other two things that I had to talk about

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
were this other thing in...

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
This is a thing...

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Moving from true crime to horror podcasts,

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
I have noticed the one thing that...

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
I've noticed a human flaw in our culture.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
It's something that I think we're letting slide too much

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
and not questioning.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
This concept that you can feel like someone's watching you,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
I don't like it.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Like what?

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
Like even cops in true crime shows will be like,

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
yeah, I went to the vacant lot,

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
and then I had that feeling, you know,

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
like someone was watching.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Like it's your professional police officer.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
And then it's like, you shouldn't be saying the same things

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
that somebody's saying in some crazy, fucking,

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
cuckoomani story about an octopus monster in a garage.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Like, where did we get this idea

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
that it's like totally kosher to be a person

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
who doesn't necessarily totally believe in the paranormal,

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
but we all can feel when someone's watching us?

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
That's crazy.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
That's moon man shit.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I'm not saying it's not possible.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I'm saying like, you better fucking say,

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
I believe in goddamn psychic phenomenon then.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
You can't just be like, well,

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
I'm famous forensic psychologist so-and-so,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
and then I got that feeling, you know,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
like you feel like someone's like watching you.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Like, what do you mean? What do you,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Spider-Man, you can't say that.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
You're not allowed to say that and be a scientist

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
or a police officer or anything.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
What if like it's a human thing of you being

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
like hypersensitive to the slightest movement,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
the slightest sound?

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
That's not what it is. That's why I don't,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
but the slightest sound.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Like, daredevil, like the hairs in the back of your neck

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
are picking up on like someone's breath.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
That's called someone being so close to you

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
that you can feel their breath.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
That's not what I'm talking about.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Like, oh, I felt like someone was watching me.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
We just accept it. We're too accepted of it.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
When people say that,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
that should be the equivalent, at least,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
if a police officer on a true crime show says,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
and then it kind of got that feeling, you know,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
someone was watching me, we should at least

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
regard that as the same as him saying like,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
you know, I knew I was a Capricorn,

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
so going in I had to bring extra bullets.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
We should be like,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I don't care how many bullets you bring,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
but don't base it on that.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Be careful.

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
You write, you write reports.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
They can't be based on no planets.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
They got to be based on the beat.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
And the street.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
All right.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Look, you know,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I've been doing this long enough.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
I feel like your pajamas,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
your pajamas are giving you too much of a sense

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
of latitude right now.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Latitude!

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Latitude, he thinks I've got.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
Oh boy, if he can stand where I'm standing,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I feel like I've got to hunch over

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
just to avoid the ceiling fan with these people.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
I know where I stand with you folks,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
and I'm fine with it.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
That's why I always bring interesting guests.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
We talk about things, you know,

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
I throw them to the sharks.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
I say this in the most loving way possible,

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
the way your father said it to you a thousand times.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
I've had it with you.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
And I say, as your babysitter often said,

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
I don't care what you think.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
And as your mother said maybe a few times,

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
like, you're not mine.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
There's no actual connection here.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
It was a legal semi-financial transaction

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
in the back alley.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
It's the best intro to a guest of all time.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
So don't even think for a second

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
you have power over my confidence.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
Shut up, you sycophantic prick!

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
See, I can't tell if your onesie

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
is making you more confident or more vulnerable.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
It's almost like it's...

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Maybe I started drinking at work early.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
You don't...

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
You don't know me!

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
You don't know nothing about me!

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Maybe after a year,

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
I finally signed a contract that makes me unfireable!

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
That seems like a safe B's high of the tech.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Oh, sure, no, yeah.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Oh, Dan, that seems safe to talk about.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Hey, Dan!

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Oh, that seems a good thing to say.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Oh, Dan, that's a good idea.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Oh, Dan, keep talking about that.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Hey, Dan, pick your battles.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Hey, Dan, keep talking.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Oh, dig a little deeper.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Too much information.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Oh, I wouldn't say what you're saying right now.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Meet, meet, moop, moop.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Fuck off, I hate it!

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
I can't stand this life anymore!

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I'm 45 years!

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I spent doing one thing right!

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
I was honest!

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
That's all I ever did!

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Just let me fucking tell you how my day went!

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
Stop fucking pretending that there's a way

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I'm gonna get through this life unscathed!

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
It's not gonna happen!

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
The only way to do it wrong is to be afraid

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
of these fucking people!

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
Let's bring out our socialist friend.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
What?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
We've had...

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
It was the best intro.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
It's our...

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
It's our favorite socialist, Josh Andrasky's here.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Yeah, measure B!

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
What's up?

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
That was real.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
That ruled.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Well, it felt real, but I didn't really say anything.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I think what I'm saying is if I feel like saying anything

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
in the future, I may say it.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
So it's a...

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
But I didn't really say anything.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
You're saying that you might say something?

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Yeah, I'm declaring an intention to say.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
It's a promise ring of saying.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Yeah, it doesn't really mean a lot.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Hell yeah, but it means some to you.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
It could be good.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
You're like the Elon Musk of saying things.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
Well, I mean, look, I know he overpromised

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
his delivery of pork people's Teslas.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Is that what you're referring to?

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
No, he's a great man and he's my best friend.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Leave him alone!

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
He's Willy Wonka, but an evil, awful, awful,

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
horrible, union-busting child man with pork skin.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
You guys are all jealous and...

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
He was a child of gem barons.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
If Ruby's in his pocket growing up, this is true.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
We love rubies.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Those are good things.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
They're beautiful.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
They look great.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
And his family keeps them from the rest of us.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
You find them in chests.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
Well, let's make you the Elon Musk of socialism.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Let's even the score a little bit.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Equal time.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Right, Elon will be responding to all of your points.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
I would love that.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
How have you been since the last time we saw you,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
which is a long time ago, probably too long?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I've been really good. Thank you.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Do you want some liquor?

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
Do we give it according to need?

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
You're looking extra marx-y right now.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
It's like slumber party marks.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
Well, I probably look like slumber party Hitler, too, though.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
I look like slumber party anybody.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
No, not with that beard.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
You have to get rid of most of your facial hair.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
You were talking about, since I last saw you,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
my beard maybe got busier.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
Well, less Hitler, like, certainly.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
I'm interested if Hitler had a beard.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
I think he would have been way cooler.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
For God's sake.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
It says a lot about you that you're like,

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
I'm going to have one little fucking square of hair on my face,

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
and that's it.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
That's the worst thing he ever did.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
I've been good.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Among his biggest crimes, facial hair.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Yes. Thank you.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
I do wonder about that mustache,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
because obviously the thing we know,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
a lot of make things come to mind is chaplain,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
but so we know there must have been some fucking thing

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
that people did back then.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Gas masks in World War I,

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
you couldn't have a long, wide mustache

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
because it would break the seal on the gas mask and the trenches.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
The fashion for short mustaches became a thing

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
where you could seal the gas mask around your mouth.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
That seems very...

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
That seems very logical,

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
but it seems like the kind of logic that ultimately is like...

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
It's like when people go like,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
you know the word fuck stands for

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
for use of carnal knowledge,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
and they used to tattoo it on witches.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I'm like, that rings logical,

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
but it also doesn't ring with the kind of organic truth

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
that most true things turn out to have.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
It almost sounds a little overwrought.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
It doesn't explain why Michael Jordan

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
had a Hitler mustache in the Haynes commercials.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
Unless he was going ham on that gas mask bong.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Oh shit.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Name a better reason.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Yeah, all right.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
Do we believe of mankind, for instance?

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
And in this case, I truly mean mankind,

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
like that mustache fashion would

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
acquiesce to gas

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
masquerade in functionality

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
while still, like, would people be that insistent

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
on a mustache that they would be like,

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
well, there's got to be some mustache there.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
That was also a mustache style pre-World War I,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
but that became a more functional mustache.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Oh, okay. All right.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
So it gained popularity because...

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
It gained functionality.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Like, if you were a fighter...

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
It gained popularity because of the functionality.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
So you keep pretending that you're correcting me.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
We're talking about the same thing.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
You fucking son of a bitch.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Oh, you're haunting the firehouse, bro.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
But we're...

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Oh, no.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
God damn it.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
Josh, I was saving that one

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
for later in the show.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
I'm so sorry.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
You loved it right up.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
That was a big mistake to save it, I think.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
That's like a cookie on a...

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I mean, not to undermine your use of it.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
He did it perfectly.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
But it was pretty easy.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
But I don't want to harp on this,

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
but I have these questions.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
They're also answerable through Wikipedia, probably.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
But what do you type in?

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Hitler mustache?

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
The chaplain?

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
It's like, what is that fucking stripe?

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Now we have this insight

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
that maybe it got signal boosted as a mustache.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
Whereas it was gas mask compatible.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Please retweet this mustache.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Please, signal boost.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
But at some point still, people are like,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
God knows why any mustache would ever...

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
I mean, we all know from playing role-playing games,

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
video games, that there's a million kinds of mustache.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Hell yeah.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
How do any of them gain any kind of favor?

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
Also going to any bar or restaurant in Silver Lake.

33:31.000 --> 33:36.000
So we got to send Malcolm Gladwell to Squirrel

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
to discover how mustaches sociologically get better.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
Josh, what has happened since we saw you last,

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
maybe personally or politically,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
I don't know, take it anywhere you want to.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
So I'll take it politically,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
because that's what I've been sort of...

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
So I guess I should say first

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
that I won a million dollars on a slot machine.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Oh, right.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
Yeah, I won a million dollars on a Big Bang Theory slot machine.

34:11.000 --> 34:16.000
That's a real thing that happened to me.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I think that was something that we didn't talk about,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
but that was true last time we saw you,

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
because you didn't then give it all away,

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
which would undermine your...

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I gave half of it away.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
I did.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Any Elon Musk could fucking take that to the bank.

34:28.000 --> 34:33.000
You won a million dollars on a Big Bang Theory slot machine,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
and gave half of it away.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
So they're like friends and family in various organizations

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
because nobody should hoard that much well?

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
And how much did they socket to you for luxury tax on that?

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Oh, boy, way more than...

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
It's got to be like half, right?

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Yeah, and then the slot machine corporation

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
cuts off a chunk for them.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
They got to have a taste.

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
I don't know why, but they cut off like six figures.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
They have a taste.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Shut up, not really.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
No, for real.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
No, shut up.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
I swear to God.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Well, we made the machine that made the money.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
What they...

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
Yes, which is how Elon Musk gets rich.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
You think it was cheap to get Chuck Lorre to agree

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
to put Big Bang Theory's face on this machine?

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
It didn't go to Chuck.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
I checked.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
I'm a millionaire now.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
I can talk to him.

35:16.000 --> 35:23.000
No, they said that what we promised you was the annuity.

35:23.000 --> 35:29.000
So you get like $50,000 for X amount of years.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
And it ended up being until I was like 55 or 60 or something.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
And I was like, there's not going to be a Nevada then.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
Give me all of it right now.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
And they're like, all right, well, we got to cut off six figures

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
for ourselves.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
And that's the deal.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
To get the lump sum.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
That is such a fucking...

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
I know, don't you feel so bad for me?

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Also...

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
Well, we do because they should...

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
Because a million fucking dollars should come out of the thing

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
and knowing that that can't happen,

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
that the fucking check that comes out should be...

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
You should be able to take it to a giant foam bank and like...

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Yes.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
The ghost of Ed McMahon is there.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
It sucks.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
But it's also uplifting actually to learn that like if you do win

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
like a bunch of money in a contest that actually it is...

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
It's like basically like as cool as getting a massive

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
unearned promotion at your dishwashing job.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
And that it only like actually...

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
That there's like four...

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Every year.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Yeah.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Yeah, that would be cool.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
So Josh, I have a question.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Yes.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I have friends that have won much smaller amounts,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
but still big amounts of money like on slots.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Right.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
Did they guilt you into tipping them really largely?

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Oh, they didn't have to.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
That was the first fucking thing.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I was like, give me all this money.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
I just want to walk around and give people a hundred dollar bills

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
because like how often do you get to radically confront

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
your own value system?

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Right?

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
Like I am a self-proclaimed card carrying socialist.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
So it was like, all right, I have to literally put my money

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
where my mouth is now.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
So like that part of it that was like could have been a Larry David

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
like what did you do to deserve...

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
I was like, what did I do to deserve this?

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
So I was just like, I'm the money man.

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
I wanted to get a suit with question marks all over it.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
Like free money for me.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
I'm assuming after all of those take-aways and all that stuff

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
that you still ended up six figures up.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Yeah, under 500,000.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
I just got for being a dude.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
Was this a high stakes game you were playing?

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
No, it was a penny slot, my man.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
Sorry, I'm hung up on something else.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
You know that suit has dollar signs on it, not question marks.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
If it was question marks, it would be the Joker.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
The Riddler.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
Matthew Lesko had the exclamation points over the dollar signs.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
The real estate guy, he looks like the Riddler

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
but he has dollar signs, right?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Matthew Lesko is his name.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
I know that from being super stoned and watching TV.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
You're not the first person that goes like oh I got question marks

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
It's like, God, if I created the Riddler, I'd be so mad.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Question marks.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Wait, really?

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Vindicated.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Wait, he can't do that?

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
No you can't.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
No you can't.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
You're probably fine with him doing that.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
I'm mad.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Intellectual property.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
That could be money out of my pocket if I was in the different...

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Yeah, you're right.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
No, he's got question marks.

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
Then I'm a double villain for cutting off this conversation.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
No, I'm happy that we proved me right.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
That rules.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
I love it.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
But I also have to go back to the Rick and Morty writer's room

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
because this is actually a running joke in the room

38:49.000 --> 38:56.000
and the butt of the joke is someone who we thought misappropriated.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
It doesn't matter.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Wait, did you have an elaborate joke?

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
I have to send three text messages when I get off the stage

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
and eat a lot of shit.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Did you have an elaborate joke premise that just came true

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
before your very eyes?

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
It came false I think.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
No, no, no. We had an in-joke.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
We were having a conversation that somehow touched on that guy

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
and then the person who described him as having question marks

39:18.000 --> 39:23.000
all over his suit was mocked, ridiculed, tarred, feathered

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
because none of us looked it up on the internet

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
and all of us agreed just from our understanding of

39:30.000 --> 39:36.000
fucking property, IP law, that there must have been dollar signs

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
to fuck you, how could you confuse them for the riddler, you idiot.

39:40.000 --> 39:46.000
And I need to buy that person a dog or something now.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
That's a fair barter.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
I feel like they're owed a dog.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
So Josh, you're in a casino, you're in Vegas, right?

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Yes, Las Vegas.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
And you're a card-carrying socialist.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
And what is the impetus to sit down and play slots as a socialist?

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
Because I'm going to steal this money from the system

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
and appropriate it to the masses?

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
It's the only honest form of capitalism.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
It's the only honest industry in capitalism is gambling

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
because everybody knows you're going to get fucked.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
When you enter into it, they're like, yes, we're going to fuck you.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
And you're like, cool, I'd love a limerita.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
You get free drinks while you're doing it.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
And the idea is that the lottery is...

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
I wouldn't be surprised in a socialist society or an anarchist society

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
even depending on the type of anarchy that lotteries would happen

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
given that they often use them to fund schools and stuff, right?

40:48.000 --> 40:53.000
Well, I mean, I don't know if there's fascist lotteries like the Shirley Jackson one.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
We've got to stay away from those.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
No, that could be good, though.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
I mean, I'm not a conspiracy guy, but do you think that people at the casino

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
go, OK, we've got a real socialist candidate?

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
I mean, look at him. He's dressed like McGyver.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
He goes on podcasts, he's got a platform.

41:09.000 --> 41:14.000
Let's make this socialist rich on casino capitalist money.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
Guess what he's going to do?

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
Go on all these podcasts and talk about...

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
What was the casino?

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
The El Cortez.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
Yeah, now everyone's going to go to the El Cortez.

41:26.000 --> 41:32.000
But, you know, it could be really good for us if you wanted at the Meundies casino.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
You know, you see what I'm doing here?

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
The messaging between socialism and casinos have the...

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
It's not incompatible messaging.

41:41.000 --> 41:46.000
Both billboards say, hey, poor, wishing you weren't,

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
come to a place that everyone like you comes.

41:49.000 --> 41:55.000
Right, except for in socialism when it's done as, like, written as you're supposed to do it.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
No one's supposed to win a jackpot.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
Well, but also nobody's supposed to go bust.

42:00.000 --> 42:05.000
It would be like everybody ties and then sometimes you win and that's cool too.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Right, they don't put that on the billboards though.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
They don't go.

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
You might not go broke and end up sucking dick for crack.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
Yeah, I mean, you're not gonna.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
That's a promise.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
You still can.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
If you want to.

42:20.000 --> 42:26.000
Yeah, what if you can provide dick sucking and you need coke?

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Right?

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
That's communism.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
That's communism.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
That's bartering, my man.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
That's the new economy.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
That's what Marx calls seizing the means of production.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
That's according to my needs.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
We're slipping into this trope though where we do,

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
we always do this in political conversation where we tend to,

42:45.000 --> 42:52.000
I'm gonna make up a new phrase in my drunkenness, we hyper-rise every ideology

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
because what we want to do is we want to go like,

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
well, the socialist is grabbing some potato chips, I see.

42:59.000 --> 43:07.000
When the reality, I would say is, come on, we've succeeded as a nation

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
by blending the right ideologies and the right ratios

43:12.000 --> 43:18.000
and we fail when we get tempted by, somebody grabs the conscience,

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
like we need to fucking step on the faces of everyone who thinks

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
that they're entitled to a fucking dollar that someone else made

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
and it's like that, that's one gas pedal that can get pressed

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
that fucks things up for everybody in the long term.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
And maybe arguably another gas pedal, though I don't know in the history of this country,

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
we've repressed it so hard that we've been threatened,

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
I think a lot of people would say we have,

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
but the opposite idea is also a terrible idea,

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
like the idea that, hey, everybody come over here and don't,

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
well, if you're feeling weak, just follow your instincts

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
and line up and hang out, we got your back

43:57.000 --> 44:03.000
and the fear is that that's gonna, oh, where are our Alex P. Catons,

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
who among us will remember how to be savage?

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
Right, yeah, they're bored with an ale in it.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
But the truth, I mean, we all learned in history class that it's good, come on,

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
we go through, like the fucking shit happens, like oil plummets through the floor,

44:17.000 --> 44:22.000
like nations go into crisis and then presidents rise up and say,

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
everyone's gotta get a job or you're gonna do this for free,

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
like these moments of historical inspiration where we blend these concepts

44:30.000 --> 44:35.000
and then we have these words that excite people, socialism, communism,

44:35.000 --> 44:42.000
you know, like it's, come on, we have so much socialism in our country right now.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Yeah, it works for everybody.

44:44.000 --> 44:50.000
Yeah, yeah, like the trash people and like all these things like municipal services.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Taxes.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Yeah, well.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
The police.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
I mean, those are the, not great ones.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
Libraries.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Fire department.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Yeah, those ones are better.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
The police that we have are better than a privatized police force.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
Yes.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
The garbage, the garbage service is better.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
You know, like we definitely.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Robocop proved it.

45:09.000 --> 45:14.000
People, the hardest core conservative is not gonna start arguing with you

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
that he thinks that 12 garbage trucks should show up and argue with each other

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
about who gets to take his garbage away from his house.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
He just wants his fucking garbage taken away, et cetera.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
And well, actually to talk about what I'm working on right now,

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
because I have all this free time now, I've devoted like it all to something called

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Measure B.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
You've definitely heard of it.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
How many other people have heard of Measure B?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Okay, that's cool.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
It is a very small campaign.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
There's only a few of us working on it right now.

45:44.000 --> 45:49.000
But essentially what it does is you were talking about privatization basically, right?

45:49.000 --> 45:55.000
Like the idea of like, oh yeah, let's just let people whose motive is to make as much

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
money as possible, decide things that matter in people's lives.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Right.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
And the things that are ostensibly, sorry to derail you for a second,

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
but the things that are ostensibly foundational to the pursuit of happiness.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Right.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Education, medicine.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
Right.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Yeah, that's where we get into these debates.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Because it's like, well, wait a minute.

46:12.000 --> 46:18.000
Is it part of being an American to, if you cut off your thumb, be able to get it reattached

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
or is it, is that something that only Mr. Howell on Gilligan's Island can have

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
and Ginger can't because she hasn't made enough coconuts yet?

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Yeah.

46:26.000 --> 46:32.000
That was a TV show in the 1970s.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
Mr. Howell was rich and so Gilligan did stuff for him.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
It didn't make a lot of sense because Ginger was a movie star.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
I guess she just didn't bring enough money in her suitcase.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
It's like, don't you think Mr. Howell is going to be like, I'm good for it.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
Lovey.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Yeah.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
All right.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Continue.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
Sorry.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
She could have used Measure B.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
But education may be sliding into that.

46:53.000 --> 46:58.000
So, well, yeah, so, well, another thing that slots into that is finance, is money, is just

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
the idea.

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
I think we talked about this one of the last times you were on is like the financing of

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
the government that the banks are involved in.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
Sorry.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Oh, this is the credit union versus...

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
Essentially.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
So it's the idea of like a for-profit bank versus a public bank.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Measure B would be the first step towards a public bank.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
You get a groan from that guy.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
I thought that was a gasp.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
Oh, it might be.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
I don't know.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
He'd let out a bunch of, he's like, oh.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
He deflated.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
Yeah.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
Continue, sir.

47:24.000 --> 47:29.500
So basically what happens now is when you go and buy an ice cream cone, the city puts

47:29.500 --> 47:34.320
your tax dollars in a private bank and that private bank uses your tax money to finance

47:34.320 --> 47:43.680
investments in oil pipelines, in guns, in cigarettes, private prisons, including the

47:43.680 --> 47:47.000
very cages that separate undocumented children from their families.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.500
Desicrating native lands.

47:48.500 --> 47:49.500
Oh, absolutely.

47:49.500 --> 47:50.500
They love doing that shit.

47:50.500 --> 47:51.500
They can't get enough of it.

47:51.500 --> 47:56.880
Guys, if all of this happened every time I bought an ice cream cone, the planet would

47:56.880 --> 47:57.880
be over.

47:57.880 --> 48:01.280
Oh, but it is.

48:01.280 --> 48:07.560
And also the government needs to get financing from banks to do governmental stuff like building

48:07.560 --> 48:08.560
a park.

48:08.560 --> 48:12.720
And the banks can say, hey, we're not going to let you build this park and give you the

48:12.720 --> 48:16.640
money unless you make burning children legal.

48:16.640 --> 48:24.640
Or they charge a much higher interest on student loans and on credit card loans.

48:24.640 --> 48:30.840
You understand interest payments are fucked and it's just extracting labor from people.

48:30.840 --> 48:35.600
Literally blackmailing the government because they realized they had the power to do so.

48:35.600 --> 48:41.200
And since that happened, we've dealt with these horrible problems coming from money

48:41.200 --> 48:45.360
not being in line with what the public needs for a society.

48:45.360 --> 48:49.160
And it plays into economic crises, right?

48:49.160 --> 48:54.480
Because banks, and this is kind of shocking, they can just straight up lend out like 90%

48:54.480 --> 49:01.440
of their deposits to anything that they want, which is a pretty obvious flaw right staring

49:01.440 --> 49:08.520
at you in the system that everybody just agrees is fine, that you can lend out 90% of the

49:08.520 --> 49:09.520
money you have.

49:09.520 --> 49:10.520
Like if I...

49:10.520 --> 49:11.520
Look into the usury.

49:11.520 --> 49:12.520
Yeah.

49:12.520 --> 49:13.520
Look into it.

49:13.520 --> 49:14.520
Yeah, okay.

49:14.520 --> 49:21.960
The FDIC is hopefully trying to help banks not come into problems where they don't have

49:21.960 --> 49:26.920
the money to when there's like a massive run on the banks, but it won't let go so far.

49:26.920 --> 49:30.520
The FDIC is just taxpayers bailing out people.

49:30.520 --> 49:38.000
So every time basically we finance all of this gambling that these total translucent

49:38.000 --> 49:41.800
sideways blinking millionaire dudes in New York, these are not my real beliefs, I'm

49:41.800 --> 49:43.880
just exaggerating for comedic effects.

49:43.880 --> 49:44.880
It's real beliefs.

49:44.880 --> 49:48.200
I'm not going to like make a hard left turn and like everyone's a lizard.

49:48.200 --> 49:51.960
Only an elite class of super lizards that go from above.

49:51.960 --> 49:55.360
If everyone was a lizard, the lizard agenda would be undermined.

49:55.360 --> 49:58.800
Some fucking asshole that was born into a specific family that makes them a billionaire

49:58.800 --> 50:03.040
is profiting off of the literal worst things in the world and we are subsidizing our own

50:03.040 --> 50:04.040
extinction.

50:04.040 --> 50:05.040
Right.

50:05.040 --> 50:08.840
Measure B is the first step to stop that because instead it would not extract all this money

50:08.840 --> 50:13.920
from the Los Angeles economy, it would keep it in the Los Angeles economy and invest it

50:13.920 --> 50:17.160
specifically in things that we deem are good, right?

50:17.160 --> 50:25.800
And so right now City Hall is like really taking our lead, which is fucking weird.

50:25.800 --> 50:26.800
Everybody wants it.

50:26.800 --> 50:28.320
Doesn't the police union want it?

50:28.320 --> 50:29.320
Yeah.

50:29.320 --> 50:30.320
Everybody.

50:30.320 --> 50:31.320
It's kind of important for California, right?

50:31.320 --> 50:36.400
Because we basically as a state, correct me if I'm wrong, California, it kind of like

50:36.400 --> 50:40.240
there's a lot of back and forth where it's like we give the landlord this much and the

50:40.240 --> 50:44.600
landlord owes us this much and blah, blah, blah, but we're basically at this point in

50:44.600 --> 50:50.160
time unless I'm wrong, it kind of all comes out even, meaning that now more than ever

50:50.160 --> 50:54.040
California has that sort of power to be like, you know what?

50:54.040 --> 50:55.040
Yes.

50:55.040 --> 50:56.040
Yeah.

50:56.040 --> 50:59.480
California's not in as much debt as it was like 10 years ago and right now is the exact

50:59.480 --> 51:04.240
time because of that sort of economic leverage for Californian cities to start doing this

51:04.240 --> 51:06.240
kind of thing.

51:06.240 --> 51:14.080
Actually, what happens now is it's about $1.1 billion a year that we owe to banks for the

51:14.080 --> 51:19.440
privilege of propping up their horrible industries and letting them profit off of this.

51:19.440 --> 51:22.040
We owe them $1.3 billion a year.

51:22.040 --> 51:24.360
Those are service charges and wasted money.

51:24.360 --> 51:25.360
Yeah.

51:25.360 --> 51:26.360
Interest and fees and shit like that.

51:26.360 --> 51:29.960
Right now, this is a fucking insane thing, but you're like, oh, it's 2018, that makes

51:29.960 --> 51:30.960
sense.

51:30.960 --> 51:38.400
50% of all infrastructure money in California right now goes directly to a banker's pocket.

51:38.400 --> 51:41.040
That's like way too much percent.

51:41.040 --> 51:42.040
That's yeah.

51:42.040 --> 51:43.040
You know what I mean?

51:43.040 --> 51:44.040
That's 50% too much.

51:44.040 --> 51:45.040
Yeah.

51:45.040 --> 51:48.400
We should probably, we're on a good roll here.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.520
We've got the audience's attention, of course.

51:50.520 --> 51:51.520
They love it.

51:51.520 --> 51:55.920
I'm a ringmaster.

51:55.920 --> 52:03.800
My profit relies on me keeping these people locked into my addiction to my content.

52:03.800 --> 52:06.440
Some of them might be going, hey, Dan, what are you doing?

52:06.440 --> 52:11.120
What are you just feeding me a bunch of numbers and a bunch of stuff?

52:11.120 --> 52:12.280
Here's the thing though.

52:12.280 --> 52:13.440
We're going to wrap it.

52:13.440 --> 52:17.240
We're going to disguise it in a little entertainment.

52:17.240 --> 52:24.640
We're going to do a little, I'm going to be a glit glop, the bank.

52:24.640 --> 52:30.800
I'm listening.

52:30.800 --> 52:34.520
I need you to do more than listen because I need your help really badly.

52:34.520 --> 52:36.000
I don't know how to.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
So you're a bank.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.960
Well, I just, I want to make this, I want to make this, I want to wrap this in a narrative

52:39.960 --> 52:44.920
and make it entertaining and provide you with a platform so you can be like, I don't want

52:44.920 --> 52:50.400
to spoil it, but I foresee you going like, hey, glit glop, you can't take 21% of that

52:50.400 --> 52:51.400
or whatever.

52:51.400 --> 52:56.360
Like we put it on a spoon with some gumdrops on it and we fucking like, you know, you're

52:56.360 --> 52:58.000
topping from the bottom right now.

52:58.000 --> 53:04.920
And what if, what if there's a fun character called MCB, like for measure B?

53:04.920 --> 53:05.920
All right.

53:05.920 --> 53:06.920
Measure B.

53:06.920 --> 53:07.920
Yeah.

53:07.920 --> 53:08.920
MCB could be the spokesperson.

53:08.920 --> 53:09.920
Right.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.400
Of glit glop, the bank.

53:11.400 --> 53:13.000
He's the spokesperson of the situation.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
Well, glit glop's the bank.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.120
No, glit glop's probably a bad person because he's a bank, right?

53:17.120 --> 53:18.120
Oh, okay.

53:18.120 --> 53:19.280
So MCB is our Greek chorus.

53:19.280 --> 53:20.280
Right.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.280
More or less.

53:21.280 --> 53:22.280
Yeah.

53:22.280 --> 53:26.720
You guys are having a bad situation and he shows you that there's a better way.

53:26.720 --> 53:27.720
Measure B.

53:27.720 --> 53:28.720
All right.

53:28.720 --> 53:29.720
All right.

53:29.720 --> 53:30.720
All right.

53:30.720 --> 53:32.240
So I'm like a customer and I'm upset with the bank.

53:32.240 --> 53:36.560
Can my name be Josh still or does it have to be like, 12 Bill Steen?

53:36.560 --> 53:37.560
Yeah, yeah, of course.

53:37.560 --> 53:38.560
I don't know.

53:38.560 --> 53:39.560
No, Josh is great.

53:39.560 --> 53:40.560
Okay.

53:40.560 --> 53:41.560
But I'm glit glop.

53:41.560 --> 53:42.560
That's fair.

53:42.560 --> 53:43.560
I'm the bank.

53:43.560 --> 53:44.560
Okay.

53:44.560 --> 53:45.560
Okay.

53:45.560 --> 53:46.560
Now I want to be someone else.

53:46.560 --> 53:47.560
Well, no.

53:47.560 --> 53:50.560
Can I be, can I be Antonio Banderas?

53:50.560 --> 53:51.560
Yeah.

53:51.560 --> 53:52.560
Okay.

53:52.560 --> 53:57.720
You're actually the second person in a month to want that.

53:57.720 --> 53:59.200
That seems like way too few.

53:59.200 --> 54:00.520
That's amazing.

54:00.520 --> 54:01.520
He rules.

54:01.520 --> 54:02.520
Yeah.

54:02.520 --> 54:08.920
Omar Camacho just expressed a desire to be him a few weeks ago.

54:08.920 --> 54:09.920
All right.

54:09.920 --> 54:10.920
Well, yeah.

54:10.920 --> 54:15.600
So are we doing a scene and then it'll turn into like kind of a Hamilton-type musical

54:15.600 --> 54:19.480
about financial, I think so, yeah, yeah.

54:19.480 --> 54:20.480
Financial power.

54:20.480 --> 54:21.480
Okay.

54:21.480 --> 54:22.480
Sure.

54:22.480 --> 54:23.480
So I'll, I'll set the scene.

54:23.480 --> 54:26.480
You haven't come in yet.

54:26.480 --> 54:27.480
Good.

54:27.480 --> 54:28.480
You're rich.

54:28.480 --> 54:29.480
Come on.

54:29.480 --> 54:30.480
Come on.

54:30.480 --> 54:33.800
Dave, you're, I think, by the way, I think that's my trainer that called out the usury

54:33.800 --> 54:35.560
thing and I think he's on your side.

54:35.560 --> 54:36.560
Look it up.

54:36.560 --> 54:37.560
Look up usury.

54:37.560 --> 54:40.600
I know when people yell things out, the primate instincts is like, shit, somebody wants to

54:40.600 --> 54:42.720
fucking kill me.

54:42.720 --> 54:45.640
What is he training you to do?

54:45.640 --> 54:47.480
Commit usury.

54:47.480 --> 54:49.600
If you have to ask nothing.

54:49.600 --> 54:50.600
Okay.

54:50.600 --> 54:53.080
I thought it was some sort of emotional training.

54:53.080 --> 54:56.480
You should have been like, holy shit, I was going to ask what happened.

54:56.480 --> 54:57.960
Oh, you look great.

54:57.960 --> 55:00.160
Zach, are you up there?

55:00.160 --> 55:03.480
And Zac McKeever up there in case we need beats for this Hamilton musical?

55:03.480 --> 55:04.480
All right.

55:04.480 --> 55:05.480
He says, sure.

55:05.480 --> 55:06.480
Okay.

55:06.480 --> 55:11.480
I mean, some of the first song would be like me setting up my bank because, you know.

55:11.480 --> 55:12.480
All right.

55:12.480 --> 55:15.600
Zach, Zach, I want you to DJ this Hamiltonian musical.

55:15.600 --> 55:17.320
We want to like Glip Glop.

55:17.320 --> 55:20.560
Well, we want to accept him.

55:20.560 --> 55:21.560
Right.

55:21.560 --> 55:22.560
Yeah.

55:22.560 --> 55:23.560
Sorry.

55:23.560 --> 55:24.560
That's what I mean.

55:24.560 --> 55:25.560
Well, maybe if Glip Glop changes from a private bank to a public bank, then we can accept

55:25.560 --> 55:26.560
this Glip Glop.

55:26.560 --> 55:27.560
Oh.

55:27.560 --> 55:28.560
Right.

55:28.560 --> 55:30.240
Oh, he's a, he'll be a, okay, good.

55:30.240 --> 55:31.240
I like that.

55:31.240 --> 55:32.240
Oh, boy.

55:32.240 --> 55:38.360
It's kind of like Book of Mormon, I assume, like, like, I'll start as a, well, why don't

55:38.360 --> 55:42.400
you be, don't be a customer then, I'll be a villain.

55:42.400 --> 55:47.160
Why are you telling Antonio Banderas what to be in the scene?

55:47.160 --> 55:49.000
You be an employee of the bank.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
Okay.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
And I'm bringing the, yeah.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
This is your first day of work.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
Okay.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
And I'm like, whoa, this is all, okay.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Cool.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Cool.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Cool.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
Because that's more like Book of Mormon and that's a hit.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
Okay.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
All right.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.600
This is going to be as good as Book of Mormon.

56:02.600 --> 56:03.600
Yeah.

56:03.600 --> 56:05.600
It's going to make people vote for stuff too.

56:05.600 --> 56:06.600
Yo.

56:06.600 --> 56:07.600
Oh.

56:07.600 --> 56:08.600
Glip Glop.

56:08.600 --> 56:09.600
Oh.

56:09.600 --> 56:10.600
Bank.

56:10.600 --> 56:11.600
Bank into America.

56:11.600 --> 56:12.600
Oh.

56:12.600 --> 56:17.600
Here come the finance.

56:17.600 --> 56:18.600
Oh.

56:18.600 --> 56:19.600
Yo.

56:19.600 --> 56:20.600
Flip the sign.

56:20.600 --> 56:21.600
Open for business.

56:21.600 --> 56:22.600
Business.

56:22.600 --> 56:23.600
Coast to coast.

56:23.600 --> 56:24.600
I got the most.

56:24.600 --> 56:25.600
All of the money comes through me.

56:25.600 --> 56:26.600
Like I was toast.

56:26.600 --> 56:39.600
Them brown on the edges and white in the middle, but everybody dances to this bank's fiddle.

56:39.600 --> 56:40.600
Welcome aboard.

56:40.600 --> 56:41.600
It's your first day of work.

56:41.600 --> 56:42.600
Be a pro.

56:42.600 --> 56:43.600
Don't be a jerk.

56:43.600 --> 56:44.600
Let me show you the ropes.

56:44.600 --> 56:45.600
Let me show you how it goes.

56:45.600 --> 56:53.880
I'll show you how to handle all the ladies in the bros and the non-binary customers.

56:53.880 --> 56:55.600
That's a growing demographic.

56:55.600 --> 56:57.600
Disposable income.

56:57.600 --> 57:02.600
They can get any job they want.

57:02.600 --> 57:10.600
Well, I'm Antonio Banderas and I'm here to say I'm at work for my very first day.

57:10.600 --> 57:11.600
Here's my accent.

57:11.600 --> 57:12.600
Good.

57:12.600 --> 57:13.600
Here's my accent.

57:13.600 --> 57:14.600
Bad.

57:14.600 --> 57:15.600
It's great.

57:15.600 --> 57:16.600
It's good.

57:16.600 --> 57:17.600
Thank you.

57:17.600 --> 57:18.600
That's rad.

57:18.600 --> 57:23.600
But you know it is not.

57:23.600 --> 57:24.600
This bank.

57:24.600 --> 57:26.600
It's all covered in snot.

57:26.600 --> 57:27.600
Morally.

57:27.600 --> 57:28.600
Oh.

57:28.600 --> 57:31.600
I feel like it's set up horribly.

57:31.600 --> 57:33.600
What do you mean?

57:33.600 --> 57:35.600
Don't you like your job?

57:35.600 --> 57:40.600
Why are you coming in here like a socialist stop, the bank works the way it works for the

57:40.600 --> 57:41.600
dollar?

57:41.600 --> 57:54.600
Yo, if you don't like it, holler at your girl, your girl being Hillary, I don't know.

57:54.600 --> 58:00.600
The thing about you that you do not understand is that you are a bank and I am a man.

58:00.600 --> 58:08.600
I see what lies before me just sorrow and I'm kind of horny, but for justice.

58:08.600 --> 58:16.600
And what I want is for you to give more of your profits to little kids so they can grow

58:16.600 --> 58:21.600
up in a world that's true and not sunk underneath the ocean blue.

58:21.600 --> 58:33.600
Okay.

58:33.600 --> 58:39.600
Certainly must say I've never spoken to a new employee with your brand of Spitfire.

58:39.600 --> 58:46.600
You never before hired an employee with my brand of Spitfire.

58:46.600 --> 58:48.600
Ting.

58:48.600 --> 58:57.600
If we weren't making more money by through our Latin X outreach tax subsidy, then we

58:57.600 --> 58:59.600
would by firing you.

58:59.600 --> 59:01.600
I don't have to tell you what I do.

59:01.600 --> 59:09.600
However, it just so happens I need a man like you in my office.

59:09.600 --> 59:14.600
Like permanently or just temporarily as we talk in a place that isn't right here on the

59:14.600 --> 59:15.600
banking floor.

59:15.600 --> 59:16.600
To speak to.

59:16.600 --> 59:17.600
Yes.

59:17.600 --> 59:22.600
Because there's things I need to read you into as they say.

59:22.600 --> 59:27.600
I will happily join you in your office, which I assume we are walking through now as I am

59:27.600 --> 59:28.600
saying.

59:28.600 --> 59:29.600
Yes.

59:29.600 --> 59:30.600
I like.

59:30.600 --> 59:31.600
I glide.

59:31.600 --> 59:38.600
Because it's Broadway so the walls are going up on strings and the new walls are coming

59:38.600 --> 59:39.600
down on strings.

59:39.600 --> 59:42.600
I'll learn the terminology.

59:42.600 --> 59:47.600
I think we could use a man like you at our upcoming conference.

59:47.600 --> 59:55.600
We're sending a few candidates out to Florida for a global banking initiative.

59:55.600 --> 59:57.600
That sounds wonderful.

59:57.600 --> 59:58.600
Florida.

59:58.600 --> 59:59.600
I love Florida.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:08.600
I love tan middle-aged white women and Jell-O shots.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:15.600
Just keep representing us the way we like to be represented so we don't lose our subsidy.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.600
You'll keep your job.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.600
There may be a promotion for you.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.600
But do me a favor.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:25.600
Put a clamp on all this commie talk you were spewing when you came in.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:32.600
But what if I told you that in doing some of these commie things, we, this bank here,

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:37.600
could keep more money instead of putting it away into other places?

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:42.600
Oh, keeping more money is called profit and I'm sure we figured out how to turn one of

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.600
those by now.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.600
You would think so.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:53.600
Will he ever understand?

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.600
Beat.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:07.600
Well, I'm the Tony of Enderis and I'm here to say, there's still a Tony of Enderis in

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.600
every way.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.600
Just have to remind you that up front.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.600
Here's the thing.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.600
I'm gone.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.600
You're doing, I thought you were doing like a solo.

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.600
Yes.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.600
Of course.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.600
This is all in my head.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.600
This is you explaining to the audience how you feel so that they're on your side.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.600
So don't hog my moment in the spotlight.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:28.600
It feels so right right here between you and me.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.600
Just me.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.600
Just him.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.600
Just me.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.600
Just him.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:40.600
Between you and me and just me, there should be life and liberty and not banks that just

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.600
create poverty.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.600
But that's just between you and me.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.600
Just him.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.600
Me.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.600
And him.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.600
Boy, oh boy, I didn't think I would rap.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:55.600
Honestly, I'm surprised it's not crap.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.600
Here's the thing that I want you to hear.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.600
Vote for measure B or I'll cut off my ear.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.600
Oh, shit.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.600
Oh no, my hearing's going.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:15.600
It's the sound of an airplane landing in Florida.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.600
Oh, yes.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.600
We're crossing a threshold.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.600
Cut the music.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.600
Oh, no.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:26.600
You're in Florida, but your ears hurt.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:31.600
Florida, moderately priced beverages everywhere.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.600
Fast casual dining.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.600
Excuse me, please get out of my way.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.600
I can't.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.600
I'm sorry.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:43.600
Let me help you pick up these files for the banking conference.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.600
Oh, I'm sure to be late now and get fired.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.600
Wait a minute.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.600
I'm worried about being fired for other reasons at this very

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.600
banking conference.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.600
Maybe you and I are very alike.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.600
Well, since we're both obviously going to take different cabs,

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.600
we're both going to be late.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.600
Wait, wait.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.600
But what if we took one cab together?

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.600
This one right here.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.600
Wow, what a Deus Ex Machina.

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:15.600
Hello, hello, did you guys want to get into my taxi cab?

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.600
For some reason I am a Frenchman.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.600
He doesn't seem sure about his accent either.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.600
I trust him.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.600
Has anyone told you, sir, that you sound a little bit like Ren from

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.600
Ren and Stimpy?

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.600
Yes, every day of my life.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:40.600
Well, I have no choice but to share this cab, but it runs counter

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.600
to everything my parents taught me about how to use...

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.600
Madam, you have every choice.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:47.600
You do not have to get into any cab that you don't want to get into.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.600
Just wait.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.600
Look at me now and understand that, yes, if we competed individually,

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:56.600
maybe you would get a cab faster than hearing me give this emotional

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.600
speech.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:04.600
But if we work together and share the cab, like two people who share

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:09.600
maybe a planet and that planet's resources, maybe we'd get there on time

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:16.600
and not get fired but prosper.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:20.600
I'll do it right now and think about it later.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.600
That's great, person whose name I don't know yet.

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.600
It's Wendy.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.600
Wendy.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.600
Wait, did you say Wendy or Wendy?

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.600
Wendy.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.600
Okay, sorry.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.600
Go back into your thing.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.600
I'm sorry I interrupted.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.600
My name is Wendy.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:48.600
Hear me blow forever.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:55.600
I often know what others know.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:00.600
It's the winds of change.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.600
For me, it's the winds of fear.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.600
Blow those winds away.

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.600
Oh, they're going, they're going away now.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:16.600
If only I had your confidence and your wisdom, Antonio.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:22.600
If only I could think twice before I speak.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:28.600
If only I had your long black locks and piercing eyes.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:33.600
If only I had your body and yours mine to keep.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:39.600
Why don't we share them?

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:49.600
In a collective of body parts and qualities.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.600
So we can both draw upon them wind.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.600
Oh, is that a cab?

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.600
Are you open?

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600
Hey.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.600
No, that's ours, sir.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:59.600
Thank you.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.600
Let's get it.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.600
Let's get it in.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.600
Come on.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.600
Let's get in the cab.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.600
Oh.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.600
Oh.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.600
Oh.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:10.600
I'm taking you to the economic conference, I understand, right?

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.600
Yes, this is the Holiday Inn.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.600
Yes, please.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.600
We're going to be big people in the banking world one day.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.600
All right, well, actually, it was next door to the airport.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.600
You didn't even have to get into my cab.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.600
Didn't we, though?

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.600
You know what?

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:32.600
I don't even want to accept any money from you because it feels like the love that you have provided the world is enough to sustain a whole community.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.600
Oh, gosh.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.600
What is it about you?

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:41.600
Ever since I met you, it's like goods are being exchanged for services with no standardized currency.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:46.600
People tell me that all the time.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.600
Hey, Wendy.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.600
Antonio.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:59.600
Why don't we, if you mind, if you are enthusiastically consenting, hold my hand.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.600
I know we did it already, but I'm asking again to prove that I am a gentleman.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.600
Okay.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:12.600
And why don't we walk together into a new world of sharing, banking, and our hearts?

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.600
Well, we've got to go to the conference, right?

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:20.600
Yeah, I meant metaphorically, but literally, yes, I mean, let's walk directly into that Holiday Inn Express.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.600
If you're asking, can we sit together at the seminar?

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.600
Of course.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.600
Oh, cool.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:29.600
I guess I have some abandonment issues, so I didn't really read that, right?

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.600
Screech!

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.600
Hello, this is me again, the cab driver. Oh, I overheard you saying you want to go into the seminar?

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.600
Yes.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.600
You have to go all the way around the back of the convention center.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.600
Hop back into the cab and I'll take you there right now.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.600
Okay.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:43.600
It'll be on the house.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.600
It'll be mutual reciprocity.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:51.600
It is not based on capitalism or any sort of agreed upon finance.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:57.600
It's just the fact that you have made me smile and I will give you a free ride around the back of the seminar.

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:00.600
Thank you so much for explaining that to us.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:01.600
Yeah.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:02.600
Let's do it.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:05.600
I just want to be totally on to the table about this.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:06.600
Absolutely.

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:07.600
All right.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:08.600
Let's go back into Zika.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.600
Antonio, I had abandonment issues once too.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:11.600
Really?

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.600
Can I give you some advice?

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.600
Sure.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.600
Abandon them.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:23.600
Abandon those issues of abandonment.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.600
I'm going to leave them behind.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.600
I promise you.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:35.600
Let them be afraid to be left alone.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:41.600
I will do that.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:42.600
Wow.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:49.600
Being here right now in the place where we first met outside of this cab makes me know that I'm going to spend the rest of my life with you.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:53.600
Will you share your life with me?

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.600
Oh.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.600
I'm afraid to abandon him.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.600
But I'm also afraid to be abandoned.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.600
But I'm not afraid to abandon those fears.

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.600
I do.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.600
Yes.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.600
She said yes.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.600
Oh, no.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.600
Let's skip the whole banking conference.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.600
There's nothing they can teach us.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:19.600
Let's open our own bank based on Cyclon B.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:20.600
What's the thing called?

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.600
Cyclon B.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.600
Oh, boy.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.600
No, it's a very common misunderstanding.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.600
As the cab driver, I overheard that.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.600
It is certainly not Cyclon B.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.600
Well, yes, on Cyclon B.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.600
That's a gas that was used in concentration camps.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.600
Yes.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:40.600
I don't know why out of all the B things with that coming to my...

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.600
Because you're feeling so many things right now.

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:43.600
We're getting married.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.600
It's because I'm from Wyoming.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.600
Yes, of course.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:51.600
You get targeted Facebook ads that say only people who are from Wyoming make up bad things just like MB would like this.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.600
Men that look like you were going to kill me.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.600
Oh, yes.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.600
No, that's your fear.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:00.600
And you're going to abandon that fear.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.600
Leave it behind.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:07.600
And come evermore near.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:14.600
We're going to get married.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:20.600
And form a form.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:35.600
Form a good part in being.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.600
Good show, man.

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.600
Good show.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.600
Hey, great show, man.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:45.600
Oh, no.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.600
Super great.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.600
Oh, great show, man.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.600
Okay, fine.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.600
One more time for Michael Flatley, everybody.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:58.600
Michael Flatley.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:01.600
So that's what a public bank is.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.600
I mean, nothing bad happened to them.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.600
They just met and fell in love.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:10.600
Yes, some stories are small.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.600
All right.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.600
But if you guys got into my cab, I was going to abduct you both.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.600
That's what it was seeming like.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.600
It was a trick.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.600
I could feel that tension.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:23.600
I was going to find out that you were a trader to the bank.

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:28.600
He's a double agent working for the thing.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:33.600
Well, Jeff spends a lot of the time that he should be here doing this show out on the

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.600
road with professional improvisers.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:39.600
So he knew where he was going and we didn't.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.600
No, but you guys are falling in love and singing and there's no way.

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.600
I thought they would laugh at that.

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.600
I didn't know what people would be like, ooh, burn.

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.600
It was a joke.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.600
I thought it would be funny.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.600
Oh, improv slam.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.600
I'm not upset.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.600
I thought it would be a funny joke.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.600
But I think maybe some of the people are resentful of you for being so absent lately.

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.600
Yeah.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.600
Or maybe they're racist.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.600
They hate Brandon.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.600
I don't know.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.600
Yeah.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.600
Only your vote will decide.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.600
The B is for Brandon.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:15.600
Sometimes.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.600
Oh, shit.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.600
That's measure B.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.600
Yeah.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.600
Measure B is Brandon.

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.600
I thought it was Ben Derris.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.600
I also thought.

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.600
Oh, that should have come up.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.600
You are good at improv.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.600
Yeah.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:35.600
Measure B is, okay, now forgive my ignorance.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.600
So do you know what a public bank is yet?

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.600
Let's start there.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:45.600
But is measure B, is it a, it's not a legal referendum.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.600
It's not something that's up for vote.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.600
It is.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.600
Yeah.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.600
Yeah.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.600
So it's a very small change to the city's charter that makes it legal to create a public bank.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.600
It is currently illegal to make a public bank.

01:12:58.600 --> 01:12:59.600
Right.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.600
And the change would make it legal.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:02.600
Oh, so simple, right?

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:03.600
Yeah, basically.

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.600
Very simple.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.600
Too simple, in fact.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:10.600
It's like when we, it's like, it's like saying, hey, porn stars don't have to wear condoms.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.600
Sorry, bad example.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.600
I mean, they don't.

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.600
But it is true.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:18.200
When we had our friend Riley Reed up here, even though that's, it's easy to cloak something

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.600
in the guise of like, we're just trying to keep people safe.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:21.600
No.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.600
But you can also be like, it's like, oh fuck, you know, oppression and stuff.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:28.600
It's like, it's not like porn stars are saying like, we want to be unsafe.

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:29.600
Right.

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:30.600
It's more like, keep this, yeah.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.600
If everyone has socialized medicine, you check all the time, parallel for me to drop.

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:36.600
This is really stupid.

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.600
I think it was the same measure, though.

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.600
Well, I think it was.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.600
I literally think it was the same.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.600
Yeah, measure B, the conom long.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.600
I think it was the same letter.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.600
It was pushed by the guy who's pushing Proposition 10.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.600
Yeah, really wild.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.600
Because Prop 10 is great.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.600
And that dude fucking sucked.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.600
Yeah.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.600
But he saw the light.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:56.600
There were a bunch of activists that basically were like, yo, Prop 10 is good because rent

01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:01.600
control is tight and people shouldn't landlord shouldn't be able to jack up prices.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:06.600
When people move out, like they shouldn't be able to do vacancy bullshit and like jack

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.600
up the rent.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.600
However much they want and keep people out of the neighborhood.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.600
Is there a lot of.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.600
So yes, on 10 also.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:13.600
Yeah.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:14.600
Yeah.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:15.600
10 rules is there.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.600
Sorry.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.600
I didn't even I was thinking about my next thing that I wanted to ask.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.600
That's good.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.600
But that's fine.

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:21.600
I'm sure measured.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:26.100
But is there what I wanted to ask is because we're like, if you even go to a bar and you

01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:31.960
aren't on Twitter like me, like I'm still I'm like right now being flooded with imagery

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:35.600
that's like proposition this and then referendum that and all this stuff.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:40.720
And it's like, and we already know like if we're if we're remotely savvy enough to get

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.440
jaded about it that that you've never you have no idea what the truth is now at this

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:50.840
point is just like what I want to ask you about measure B is for the for the folks that

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:53.440
are listening like that are in Los Angeles.

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:58.160
What can they expect to see on TV or hear from their friends who have saw something that

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:03.280
someone else on TV that's like the most common like reflexes like nut kick.

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.680
Like well, I heard that's for just people that want to have elephants eat their dick.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:11.200
Well, I heard we don't even know what's going to happen if we vote yes on measure B. We

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:15.920
might be unleashing the gates to the apocalypse because we don't know on paper what it is.

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:16.920
Shut up dude.

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:17.920
Don't tell him.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:18.920
Yeah.

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:20.360
No, that is the opposition.

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:23.800
What's the biggest opposition is we don't know what could happen.

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:24.800
Maybe demons.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:25.800
Right.

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:26.800
Pretty much.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.800
There's that.

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.600
I'm just glad we chose this opportunity to talk about this on a podcast that will air

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:32.600
two days after.

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:33.600
Oh, yeah.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:34.600
Right.

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:35.600
You're right.

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:36.600
You're right.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.200
Well, we're talking to well, that's a bunch of fired up people here.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.800
It makes it makes more at least 5000 people here tonight at the dime a tap link letter

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:45.040
that will certainly go out and vote tomorrow.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.040
You're too.

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.040
You're fair enough.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.040
Jeff.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:54.680
I called you to I called you to because I started, I aborted to to say, okay, it was

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:55.680
a shitty tissue.

01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:00.000
Very, very, however, it actually kind of makes sense because we're talking to the 38 people

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.400
in Los Angeles that come actually to see the show.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400
I love it.

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.400
There's more than 38.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400
Thank you.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.400
Four more.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.400
Yeah.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:12.160
Four more audience members, four more audience members.

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.240
Don't chant that.

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.960
So here's the thing, the other thing is people are like, Oh, what, the city's going to run

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.960
a bank.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:27.320
How can they run a bank because they can't and to that, I've always said that.

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.840
That's basically literally the guy in the ballot.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:35.000
If you read the ballot, the argument against measure B for the guy who is he he looks exactly

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
like you think he would.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.360
His name is Jack Humphreyville and he has no neck at all whatsoever.

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:44.200
Jack Humphreyville and he literally in the ballot in the argument against measure B

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:48.520
he goes, It's baloney.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.840
And there was there's a thing that ran on KCRW today that interviewed a bunch of us

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:57.520
organizers for B and him and he's like, It seems like they're getting stoned.

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.880
Like those are that's really what it is.

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:05.840
He won't stand the baloney, you know, the only slippery slope I could think of I would

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:10.760
have to go into like shadow run logic or be like, Are you saying that in the year 2040

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:15.520
Los Angeles could be a corporation turning more profit than San Diego and go to war

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.520
with them?

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:21.000
No, but seriously, so we want to discuss you should discuss that because people are worried

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
about that.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.320
There is a fear people have, but the reality is a fear I would love to have.

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.320
Right.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:29.920
I would love the opportunity Los Angeles is a trillionaire, right?

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.880
And I think it would be better if do you guys have a real vision for what it's going to

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:38.320
look like because a lot of the push has been, Oh, we don't have any strong, it's only we're

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.800
making it legal to talk about now, so then going forward, if it passes, we'll be able

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:47.000
to in city councils discuss what we want the shape of this to be and actually legislate

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
it into existence.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
So we're already doing that.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Right.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.040
So what, what, what, how is that process going to work?

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.960
And how is it going to prevent us from like just being taken over or whatever, who's going

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:56.960
to govern it?

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:57.960
What?

01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:02.000
So the important thing right is first and foremost, right now, the people in charge of

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.040
the banks, you have zero means of democracy there, right?

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:10.920
Collabs, Lloyd Blank, right now, right now, right now, the city just has to get in line

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.680
with you at Bank of America and open an account.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:14.680
Yes, exactly.

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.680
And it's like, yeah.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:18.720
Do I get the checks or what?

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:19.720
Yeah.

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:20.720
Shout out.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:21.880
And get his personalized checks.

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:22.880
I had them.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:23.880
Oh, yeah.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:24.880
The babies are so cute.

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.520
They're flower pots.

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:34.520
So what would happen is there would be a very strict charter that we so city council is

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:37.240
letting us organizers have a seat at the table.

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:40.680
We are also working on state legislation that we need to be passed in order to make this

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:41.680
a possibility.

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.040
So in doing that, because statewide it's also illegal, right?

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.040
Yes.

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.040
Right.

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:51.040
But other cities have already made, because of their charters, they're able to do what

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:54.000
Measure B would do for our like Oakland and San Francisco specifically.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000
They're already working on it.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000
They're already working on it.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.200
They've, they've like, they're like, okay, we've got task force and it's not shitty bankers.

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:03.800
They're like letting the organizers lead the way because everybody's like, oh, this saves

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.800
us billions of dollars and we get to fill in potholes.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.560
So it's kind of okay that we're talking about it on our podcast.

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.480
Well, I hope so.

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.720
Because it's like medical marijuana a couple of years ago.

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:18.600
It's like an issue that's, you know, maybe the referendums will be different numbers

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:19.600
and things.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:20.600
Yes.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:21.600
It's going to start.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.600
This is like a harbinger.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.600
Hopefully this can be a domino effect.

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.920
So what happens next is there's the, it's just a slick harbinger.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:35.640
So what happens next is the, the, the charter has to be very strict and it has to say we

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:41.080
will not invest in oil pipelines or private prisons or fucking baby cages or any of that

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.080
shit.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:46.520
I can't, it might say I literally can't believe I have to write baby cages, but here we are

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.520
baby cages.

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.520
No to that.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:51.720
I never thought I'd have to not check this box.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:52.720
Right.

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.920
Never thought this box would have to be an option, but here we are.

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:59.000
And so, and then also prioritize, right?

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:06.840
Like if we're going to not all die in 40 years, like the UN's report just said might happen.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:12.040
They've been saying that for eight years.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:21.280
First it was 48 years, then it was 47, seven years later, no, it's 40 years, the world's

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:28.240
going to end, but maybe if you do something at 20 you could maybe blah, blah, blah.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:36.120
I went jogging the other day, it was warm or I'm sorry, cold.

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.620
Weather changes people.

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:40.120
All right, sorry.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:48.040
So again, there's something about pajamas that has made you, no, it's alcoholism.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.040
I'm so drunk.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.040
Okay.

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:55.320
But you're wearing your alcoholism like micro-model fiber, right?

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:58.680
I hope that myundies could see this at a compatible marketing point.

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.560
It's three times softer than normal alcohol.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:04.600
Can we take a moment, can we get a momentary nipple update where your nipple's at?

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:05.600
It's fine actually.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:06.600
Nipple experiment.

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:07.600
That's a good advertiser too.

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.080
Hey, are you a nipple guy?

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.080
Don't worry about it.

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:15.880
Do you get horny when soft things touch your nipples?

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:21.160
Are you therefore worried about wearing a Myundie onesie?

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.080
I'm Dan Harmon.

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.920
I've been sitting up here.

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:31.880
Wearing draped in fabric and I've been talking about banking for an hour.

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:34.000
I ain't got no hard on.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.200
Myundies, I ain't got no hard on.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.080
I'm going to sleep like a baby.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:44.520
Baby ain't got no hard on.

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:47.800
Maybe we'll go back to the drawing board on the baby one.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:52.160
But anyway, if we're going to mobilize enough capital to not all die in 40 years, we're

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:57.720
going to need to do it by a lot of money in the billions and a public bank after five

01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:59.920
years and we'll be able to renew.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:03.520
We're talking renewable energy for whole neighborhoods, solar panels, batteries, all

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:07.880
that shit because we're taking billions that we're going to bad stuff and putting it to

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:08.880
good stuff.

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:12.040
Morally, it's pretty black and white.

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:19.320
I remember Sarah Silverman talking about this years ago and this is sort of a cousin

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:22.320
of divestment.

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.320
That's what she was talking about.

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:28.040
We're going to get it out of your nationally franchised banks and put it into credit unions,

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:32.320
which I have not done yet and I should do.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.520
You should because I've scared my accountant a little at me.

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.440
You got to be afraid of an accountant your whole life.

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:42.760
The idea there is that, hey, if your bank, God bless their soul, they don't have to be

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:47.840
evil to be following the marching orders of, we're supposed to make more money than the

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:51.200
bank across the street, which is also an international bank.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:56.800
So of course, your funds are going to tend to end up aerosol misted across the planet.

01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:01.520
Josh has invested all of his $500,000 winnings from the casino into mattress.

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.520
Wait.

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.520
At his house.

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:07.520
I'm Casper, Dave, the friendly boy.

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.520
Oh, I'm Casper.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.520
Sorry, Casper.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.520
That's me.

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:11.520
I'm the mattress guy.

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:17.760
I put all of my Rick and Morty merchandising money in one blue apron.

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:21.800
The bluest apron of all because there's no better investment than a meal delivered to

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:27.640
your home in pieces that you then assemble.

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:33.760
Have the satisfaction of an adult while remaining a child.

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:41.600
It's like curry and barbecue, but for other genres of food, it's, it's, it's the same

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:47.120
lifestyle you're used to, but we have your credit card number, but you do have to work

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.120
too.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.760
From a distance, you'll look like a grownup.

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.800
Oh, you don't have time to pick and choose your own fucking things, baby.

01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:01.800
Take the box, please.

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:07.920
Think of it as adulting wheels.

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:13.000
Don't have time to check the cabbage.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.360
Don't have time to know whether you should buy cabbage.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.360
We will give you a box.

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:20.600
Honey, did you check cabbage today?

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:24.640
There will be a bag of cabbage in it that will say, pour me into a skillet.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:29.280
What about a new service that picks you up like a Lyft or an Uber or a Post-Mate or a

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:33.480
Grubhub or whatever, and they, there's just an adult-sized shopping cart that you get

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:35.480
to sit in like a baby.

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.880
Oh my God, that would be amazing.

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:41.400
And you get to, you get to go through a farmer's market and learn how to like buy.

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:42.960
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:49.480
That's the, it's a, it's a, it's a, now this guy's talking about fucking like, God damn

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.480
it.

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:51.480
You could do a cheaper one.

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:57.640
A giant Lily Tomlin shopping cart where you get to remember, you put your, you sit facing

01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:04.000
a fucking dude who's like, or, or, or whatever, a parental figure who's like, well, what do

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000
you like?

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.400
And you're like encouraged, you're encouraged to be like, they tell you like, they're like,

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:14.920
do not, you are not here to please this person.

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:21.120
Like you're, we want you to cry, throw a tantrum, like, like test us, test us.

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:24.640
And it's like, they're starting, they just wheel you around and they go like, do you

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:28.520
like lucky charms or no.

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:32.200
And you just get to like fucking, can you, I have so much rage and shame in me right now

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:34.440
that would be exercised by that.

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:39.160
I'm not, I know it sounds like a big fucking joke, but I'm so, and I know it's not really

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:48.040
viable as a financial institution, but I would pay so much if they said, like, have you ever,

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:54.600
have you ever gone groucher, groucher dolting or what about, wait, what about like the Uber

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:55.600
pool version of that?

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.520
Would it be like a double wide so everybody gets to kick their legs out?

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:02.440
Yeah, you do it with friends and you get to like pedal the cart, like one of those beer.

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:06.440
If you pay less, they have to be just in the car and they get like carrots put on them

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:07.440
or whatever.

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:12.600
Oh, how amazing would it be if the person was a giant robot?

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:15.800
That was just like mom legs from like Muppet Baby or whatever.

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:21.400
And you could like throw food at it and go like, fuck you, bitch, fuck you.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:27.240
I don't want to go to school tomorrow, but Daniel, you're sitting on just this wire mesh

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:34.080
bench with their best friends who like group onto this experience and you pedal and you

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.080
go like, let's go.

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.080
So what do you guys want to do?

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:40.640
And you just go, let's go to the beer aisle and it's like, give us beer and the robots

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:45.880
program to go like, you're not old enough, blue, blue, blue, blue.

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:49.800
And you're just like, fuck you, you piece of shit.

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:52.680
Are you sure you meant to talk to your mother like that?

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:55.680
Dan Harmon.

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:59.680
Dan Harmon party.

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:02.480
Dan Harmon party guest one.

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.160
Dan Harmon party.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.800
Were any of you asked to be born?

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:07.800
No!

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:09.720
We weren't asked to be born.

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:12.240
I'm so happy my dumb idea got this much traction.

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.240
That's so good.

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.240
I'm tired.

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:17.240
I mean, that's, that is like, like, like fucking to sit.

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:21.000
I like, like, I think we all had a visceral memory except maybe a couple of people that

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:29.440
are like, most be nice and I don't, I don't want to hear their story, but, but, but, but,

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.800
but, but like that, that, like, that feel, I just, I forgot, you know, because it's not

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:37.080
something that celebrated it, but it's like, holy shit, like putting your little tushy

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:42.320
in a fucking shop and wheeling your crabby little ass around and asking what you like

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:43.320
and don't like.

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:46.120
It's not like you got anything that you wanted, right?

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:49.680
Like, like, like, it's, but it's actually the agency is what's delicious.

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:54.440
So it's like, you're just being able to go like, I want bananas.

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:55.440
You want, we got bananas.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.720
I'm like, those are green.

01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:03.840
They turn yellow eventually says you, you know, just the right to be a little prick.

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:08.000
I don't mean to like burst the bubble, but I feel like with like the right amount of

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.360
mushrooms, you could do this from your very home.

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:17.400
So virtual reality, right, that, that's could be a huge, it's sort of like, like, remember

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:22.280
in the seventies, I remember references like primal scream therapy, you know, like, like,

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:26.800
like, make fun of everything, but it's like, I'm telling you, man, I've been through some

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.800
shit this year.

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:32.120
I, I, I'm aware of the fact that I have not been through nearly as much shit as almost

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:34.240
anyone listening.

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:39.280
That is not how I, how I measure shit is by your measurement.

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:44.360
But my point is like, I've been through some shit this year that most notably I, I, I can't

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:45.360
talk about.

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:49.760
And it, and it builds this fucking, my therapist has told me so many weeks in a row.

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.160
She's like, you're going to go get a drink.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.960
Are you going to get, are you going to medicate this?

01:28:53.960 --> 01:29:00.760
And I'm like, probably like, bet no, ain't no one invented nothing better.

01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:03.240
Like, like, like, like, she did.

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:04.720
It's called weed, dog.

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.840
Well, wait, no, I don't, no, dude, we, I don't know, I mean, I don't want, I don't want to

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:13.120
just from the hip, like negate that because sometimes it says no cops on it.

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:17.640
That's more of a crapshoot for me where it's like, I hit the wrong weed at the wrong time

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:18.640
and the wrong amount.

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:20.280
And then all of a sudden I'm like, what are you doing?

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.240
You're, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:27.960
But booze is as old as a fucking cowboy, biting a belt, like you suck a snake venom out of

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.760
his titty.

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:31.680
And then he gives you a free gun.

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:36.080
It's just fucking brute force that was by four across the head, fucking, you're drunk

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.080
now.

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:41.800
And the trouble being that you, as my therapist says, she's like, it's a preservative, like

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:42.800
what do we do with shit?

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:45.200
And it's like, sometimes she's a little clever about this stuff.

01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:49.080
But I think it's like, it's like, yeah, it does, it preserves it.

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:50.800
Like I have no place to put my rage.

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:55.120
I'm like, I'm like punching shit, I got bloody knuckles, like, I'm like, I'm like, every

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.360
once in a while I'm erupting into this rage.

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:03.880
And I think that it's like, sooner or later I'm going to put it somewhere and it could

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:07.720
be a place that hurts me or, or, or another person.

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:13.280
And I feel like actually, like we must all feel that constantly, where it's like, well,

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:19.160
how, how, when do I get to shit my pants and I just think it's a wonderful like, like,

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:23.760
like, actually maybe that's what virtual reality could be is like, you throw these tantrums,

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:28.840
you just go like, I'm a baby, I want to, that's what this podcast was for me up until this

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.440
last year.

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:31.960
This is where I came to sit.

01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:35.440
This is ask these guys, they'll tell you, they've been pushing me in a shopping cart

01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:43.000
and I've been, I've been going, give me fruit lips and you guys have been like, what do

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
you mean?

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:49.760
Do you want to be socially conscious and I'm like, I don't know, depends if I have to or

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:50.760
not.

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:57.400
And then, but then like, there was this marking point of like January 2018, where it was like,

01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:04.440
okay, strategically and hell, for every reason in every column, Dan, you're not allowed to

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:09.000
say what you're feeling and thinking.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:14.040
And what is a tantrum that it's like, it's the most obnoxious horrible thing and we associate

01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:18.200
it with children and we're like, you piece of shit, you should never look at that fucking

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:25.080
and we blame and we look, you're in the airport and you hear a kid going like, like, we hate

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.080
them.

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:30.240
It's like, terrible, terrible little people, they're having a fucking tantrum in the middle

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.240
of an airport.

01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:37.120
Like, our species, maybe that's the, that's the next wheel is like, can we find it?

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:38.880
Because what are we having right now politically?

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:42.440
We're having tantrums, tantrums over everyone's having a fucking tantrum.

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:50.400
I mean, so, okay, a couple of things, one, we'll get there though, we'll get there.

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:56.920
Age Cage, it's a, it's a concept that's like Japanese therapy that was very hilariously

01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:01.880
used in the show, Delocated, which is like a criminally underrated show.

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:06.560
And it's just a room that they set up and they just give you a fucking hammer.

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:11.880
And it's just like a scene and a fucking old TV and, and I thought like another person

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:16.000
I'm like, wait, I don't know, no, no, no, yeah, I'm not, I'm not a billionaire, it's

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
called murder.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:22.600
I'm only a millionaire, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't kill with impunity.

01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:29.360
Um, no, it's, it's, it's just stuff, it's property, which is not violence, it's vandalism

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.520
when property is destroyed, and therefore it's fine.

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.920
Yeah, but it's anyone, whatever, I'm not going to poo poo that, thank you for sharing

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:35.920
it with me.

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:39.080
So there's that, then the other thing I would say is like politically speaking at least,

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:44.200
sorry to be uncle fucking socialism, but if we get rid of-

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.200
His name is Uncle Stahl.

01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:46.200
At least he apologized.

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:47.200
Yeah.

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:51.740
If we get rid of all the horrible things that we are willingly participating in and also

01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:55.960
just make things better in the way that we absolutely know is possible, then everybody

01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:59.720
wouldn't feel like screaming all the time, because you just feel like a crazy person

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:01.600
because you're like, we all know better than this.

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:05.400
Well, can I bring up a thing that I'm really jealous of our forebearers of, which is that,

01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:09.400
and maybe this is the oversimplification that happens when you, you look backwards because

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:15.600
maybe it wasn't simple back then, but like all these historical chapters that we look

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:20.720
at counter culturally, it's always the people that are unashamed versus the people that

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:21.800
are ashamed.

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:24.120
And we don't have that culture war going on right now.

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:29.360
We have two different kinds of people that are both like willing to engage in shame and

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:33.600
fear arguing with each other about which type of shame should pay, which type of dividend

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:34.920
and which amount.

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:37.240
And it's like, how are you going to win that fight?

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:43.080
Like there's got to be some way to fucking move this line so that it's like in that classic

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:48.600
tradition of like, look, man, you can fucking make fun of everybody you want.

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:53.200
You can like harass anyone you want, but if you're harassing them, they're on my side.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:54.200
I don't fucking care.

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:58.820
Like I am not signing up for this Boy Scout troop where everyone dresses the same and doesn't

01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:04.880
have any fun and let the enemy say, no, we have fun and let them prove it because they

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:05.880
can't.

01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.880
Hey, man, that is happening.

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:12.320
But they can prove that they have fun when they're trolling us and watching us dance like

01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.320
monkeys.

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:16.400
So we're going like, whoa, whoa, whoa, someone told me that there's something outrageous

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:19.720
over here and they're laughing all the way to the fucking troll bank.

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.720
Like it's like, we got to take that power.

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:22.720
I hate that bank.

01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:24.920
Vote no on the troll bank.

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:25.920
That pays nothing.

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:29.160
We got to, we got to figure out how to put that in the hands of the city.

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:32.320
It's such as the troll bank just traffics in like Pepe Bitcoin.

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:37.760
We got to get, we got to, you got to answer three riddles before you can get a deposit.

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:39.560
So the bank's going to be under a bridge.

01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:40.560
I know.

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:46.560
I think like the thing that they're now delighting it is like just overt racism's because that's

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:51.800
they have kind of been retreated to a point where it's like, I guess we got to take pride

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:58.320
in this because you know, Taylor Swift is mad at us and Kanye stopped being into politics

01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.320
now.

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:02.760
You know, well, yeah, there's going to be a treasure trove to the extent that we progressed

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:07.080
to the point where 10 years ago everyone was racist, then that means that everyone can

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:11.720
now go back 10 years and find something racist, you said, which we should all be mindful of

01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:13.160
and go, yeah, shit changes.

01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:19.880
I was fucking, I said shit that is bad 10 years ago, but we are in this mode.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:24.520
I think of like, that my only point, I'm not even starting to say, you know what we need

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:25.520
to do?

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:31.000
I only came up because talking about tantrums, I think the reason why tantrums are so exciting

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.400
to me right now is because actually we're constantly throwing them online at each other.

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:42.640
Even people that are on our side, we are just frothing at the math, and if you told a Martian

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:47.840
what level of technology we were at and then said, you know, they would say, oh, so.

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:50.160
We've achieved tantrum technology.

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:53.640
Wait, wait, wait, well, if you told them we've achieved the technology where anyone from

01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:58.720
any device, no matter what their income level, basically like with the price of a fucking book

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:03.240
of matches, you could basically have an opportunity to type anything anywhere and it would be seen

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:07.000
by everyone, depending on whether or not anyone thought it was worth reading.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.720
That all sounds to me like the Martian would go, oh, so you probably have a lot less frothing

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:15.000
at the mouth than fucking crazy tirades, right?

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.280
And it's like, and then you go, no, the opposite.

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:21.600
The Martian would go, well, then something must be wrong that you're not telling me.

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.840
The technology is so new.

01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:27.480
We've never before been so plugged into what's happening exactly everywhere.

01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:31.320
And like our brains aren't used to like being like, hey, here's this horrible thing happening

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:34.040
in a country I'm just telling you about.

01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:38.200
For the first time ever, you're going to learn about a brand new country because of a horrible

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.200
thing that's happened.

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:40.880
All that information is new.

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:44.680
But something that's not new is something that a lot of our parents like kept telling

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:49.160
us in kindergarten teachers, which is like, if you don't have something nice to say, don't

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:50.160
say anything at all.

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:54.080
If you don't have like golden rule shit that we think goes out the window because we're

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:58.320
looking at something that excites us, that traumatizes us.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:02.800
We believe that there's a deal breaker that's present and well, but yeah, but it's on my

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:07.840
phone and it's like, no, motherfucker, that's exactly the point where you're being tested.

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:08.840
Right.

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:12.200
Well, it's because you're not looking at a human being and getting the facial recognitions

01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:13.680
of like, oh, you're a person.

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:16.280
You're not going to get your ass kicked, for instance.

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:18.520
You're not going to get punched in the face.

01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:22.400
You're not going to have to not make eye contact with someone that's more powerful than you.

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:24.720
All this shit that we should be a three worse thing.

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:30.680
We should be ashamed of as far as incentivizations to express ourselves or not.

01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:35.240
That's another reason why we're being tested and trained by this technology.

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:42.440
It's like, oh, I just watched a guy get shot to death on a street and I watched the cops

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:45.440
gun tremble in his hand.

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:50.960
And then I have a bad day at work and then my therapist goes like, yeah, but don't you

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:55.960
think your body knew you saw that and I'm going like, yeah, but I didn't talk about

01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:56.960
it.

01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:57.960
I didn't retweet it.

01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:58.960
I didn't.

01:37:58.960 --> 01:37:59.960
Yeah.

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:00.960
But you fucking took it in.

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:01.960
You're being traumatized.

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:06.880
Now, it's not like we need to turn our backs on that, but it's like we are currently acting

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:13.320
like it's normal to watch people get shot and killed like it's normal to wake up every

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:18.720
day to the news that everyone's a piece of shit and that we're all going to die, which

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:23.600
may or may not be true, I'm not saying that's a lie, but it's fucking weird messaging to

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:28.160
get when you wake up and I'm telling you, we didn't get it when I was a kid every day.

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:29.640
Fred Durst didn't come on this fucking TV.

01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:35.920
I got the message when I was your age that Snoopy hated Mondays, like depending on you.

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:38.720
Well, you got that message wrong.

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:39.720
It's Garfield.

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:40.720
There was, there was.

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:45.800
You got it that we just kicked the Kaiser's ass.

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.880
I'm sure Snoopy hated Mondays too, died by fire.

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:49.880
Whoa.

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:54.120
Speaking of fire, speaking of fire, you're really haunting the F house, dude.

01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:56.000
Oh man, haunting the F house.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
No, no.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
You're ancient.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Too many times.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Too many times.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Too many times.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.800
Well, whatever, I'm, I'm, it's tantrum, tantrum technology.

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:06.800
That's what we need.

01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:07.800
We need, we need.

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:08.800
Yeah.

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:09.800
Primal scream assisting technology.

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:13.920
I think like truly because I'm telling you, I'm still walking around.

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:18.560
And I can now measure it by therapy because my therapist will ask me what's happening

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.560
in here.

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:24.520
I have a column of rage inside of me that I can measure and observe.

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:26.960
And I don't have to act on it because I'm 45.

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:29.760
I can just let it sit and burn.

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:31.760
But I know when it's zero.

01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:34.680
I know when I'm like a fucking kite in the wind.

01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:39.960
And I'm like, whoa, here you go, Pearl Jam and lyrics and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:40.960
blah, blah.

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:43.280
Like, like, I feel, I feel it every once in a while.

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:47.560
You become drunk any better, but it keeps tight any better.

01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:48.840
It keeps filling up.

01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.040
It fills up.

01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.040
And then you can feel it.

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:55.760
You know, it's, it's, it's, it's, you can, you can punch a wall and have it really not

01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:56.760
go down.

01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:57.760
Right.

01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:58.760
There is.

01:39:58.760 --> 01:39:59.760
You really punch a wall and really bloody your knuckles.

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.760
I punch it.

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:01.760
I've been punching it.

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:07.360
I have punched more walls this year than I punched the year I got divorced.

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:11.360
Like, like, I, and, and, and it's been in the last couple of months.

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:20.000
And it's been because of outrage, uh, about shit that I, uh, can't talk about.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.680
And it's largely been about that meta fact that I can't fucking talk about it.

01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:27.840
So I punch a fucking wall because what the, what else am I going to do?

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:36.400
The alternative would be to pollute my relationship with Cody, to pollute my, my workplace, to,

01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:44.960
where do you go when you are filled with just a foundational fucking incompatibility with

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:47.000
a planet full of idiots?

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
TJ Maxx.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:53.880
That's their slogan, right?

01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:56.040
I think it's self-destructive of them.

01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:57.040
Yeah.

01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:01.680
I think, I think, I think it flew in the face of their base, but where do you go when you

01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:09.480
have a foundational incompatibility with a planet of idiots, TJ Maxx.

01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:10.480
It's catchy.

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:11.480
You gotta give them that.

01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:14.200
All this summer, men's pants are two by two.

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:15.200
We got shelves and stuff.

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.200
I don't know how clothes work.

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:17.200
Yeah.

01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:20.360
Do they sell them, like, animals on the Ark?

01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:26.600
Yeah, marching on the Ark, two by two, hurrah, hurrah.

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:33.160
I think that, I mean, I don't know, I feel like there's a lot of people right now who

01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:36.560
just have a voice for the first time with the internet.

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:41.240
There are folks in marginalized groups that are speaking up for the first time.

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:47.560
There are people who are like us, who are white men, who aren't really used to being

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:53.200
challenged a lot that's happening now, and it's up to us to just sort of be like, well,

01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:57.000
you know, we kinda just gotta suck it up and deal because boy, oh boy, has it been easy

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000
to be a white man.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.480
And certainly a credit card debt to pay.

01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:03.640
I'm really glad you brought that up, because not only did three years ago on this podcast

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:12.960
that I knew, I wanted to make sure I acknowledged that, that as far as voting concerns, on this

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:18.840
very podcast, I have changed from a guy who was like, your vote doesn't matter, boo, boo,

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.760
and I was in my 40s saying that.

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.080
I used to say it, too.

01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:25.760
So that, you know, but if you asked me at that time, I'd like to say if you asked me

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:30.560
what my deal breaker was, I would have, I would say, I don't know, a fascist coup, but

01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:34.640
however, like, I'm glad you brought, that's the more important thing to bring up, because

01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.560
I was 25 once, and I'm gonna give it 20 years ago.

01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:47.520
And when I was 25, yeah, I mean, if I was living in this world now, would I leave an

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:56.480
Instagram comment on a man's Instagram, whose cartoon I liked telling him to get back to

01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:00.040
work because his cartoon's like, no, never, no, those people are horrible.

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:01.040
Yeah, they are.

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:09.000
However, but, but, but, but, you know, but now they have a voice, but, but, but a lot

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:16.120
of the people who, who are saying things like, we have been, we've been equalized, like,

01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:23.840
you can't, it's the very beginning of the start of a whisper of it from a emotionally

01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:30.080
retarded 19 year old from a 25 year old who's been abused as a child from a 36 year old.

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:34.520
That's like, like the, all of that shit is out the window, which is probably ultimately

01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:38.560
if we survive this rapture, a better thing than a worse thing.

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:44.440
Because throwing out biological strata is probably going to could benefit us if we

01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:45.440
survive this.

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:49.560
Yeah, we're all going to need to work together to survive the horrible things that are in

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:52.120
store for us in the future.

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:56.360
But I guess that means that if you're a 45 year old and you're like, I hate the world,

01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:01.560
like the test upon you, if I expect today's 25 year old to comport themselves with some

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:05.120
dignity when they're leaving comments on my girlfriend's Instagram, there should also

01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:09.920
be that I have to look at myself as Gandalf and go, well, you have responsibilities to

01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:10.920
kind of.

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:18.640
Like, if Peregrine took, knocks a barrel down a well, like, what if Gandalf had just been

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:22.680
like, you piece of shit, I'm going to skin you alive.

01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:28.920
And then the ogre's came and he's like, just take him, I don't care, I fucking hate Middle

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:29.920
Earth.

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:30.920
Did you know wizards aren't even men?

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:36.200
They're like a different species in this world, I'm a fucking elite, I'm out of here,

01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:39.200
teleport, level nine.

01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:43.080
I'm Gandalf the purple in a world without dipshits.

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:47.200
I come here for fun.

01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:52.320
I love the image of Gandalf being like boring.

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:55.280
He kind of does big deal.

01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:56.440
He does do that.

01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:01.800
But I'm realizing now, okay, maybe don't be irritated by him because he also he's the

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:06.680
acid test is he goes, you shall not pass to a fucking ball rock.

01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:11.560
He's out there and he says, fly you fools.

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:16.200
To be fair to him, he gets to apparently live through that, which no one else does.

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:19.080
Like, oh, hey, where are you?

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:25.680
Well, I lost that fight to the demon and fell through a thing and then I am back.

01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:26.680
I think he won.

01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:32.120
Yeah, that's a good metaphor for the structural benefit that being a white man has in this

01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:33.120
society.

01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:34.960
You don't have to fight the ball rock that hard.

01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:35.960
Right.

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:38.200
Yeah, you just become Gandalf the white.

01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:46.800
Yeah, Gandalf the toxic male white, Gandalf the Gandalf the white fragile, the fragile

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:50.840
white gun owner.

01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:56.240
You could take my staff for my cold dead hands.

01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.920
I didn't buy it because I'm conservative.

01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:01.640
I bought it because they're rude in the world.

01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:05.920
I don't know why I'm using this voice when that's literally my justification for having

01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:07.420
bought a gun.

01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:08.420
Did you buy a gun?

01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:09.920
Yeah, because I might kill myself.

01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:10.920
Oh, all right.

01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:14.520
Well, that's actually a reason, I mean, because that's one of the things that might happen

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:15.520
when you buy one.

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:16.520
No, that's not true.

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:17.520
I was supposed to get a laugh too.

01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:18.520
All right.

01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:19.520
It's true.

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:25.760
Like, it's probably true that I would maybe right.

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:28.040
That's why everyone didn't laugh.

01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:33.800
Dan, let's talk about how satire works.

01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:40.440
Well, satire works truth and jest, I mean, but I'm like, like, no, it's just because

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:46.520
if I were to ever, like, for instance, I would never, I'm never going to kill myself because

01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:51.600
unless unless I would never as Cody dies.

01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:56.920
If Cody dies, my promise is not broken if Cody, if he's already backtracked.

01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:02.360
So what you've just said is you'll never kill myself.

01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:03.360
Wait a second.

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:04.960
You have not ruled out murder, suicide.

01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:05.960
That's good to know.

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:07.200
No, no, I'm not going to murder Cody.

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:11.400
That's a strange read, but technically true.

01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:12.400
It was interesting.

01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:17.080
It was interesting in a Shimali on a kind of yeah, I like the way you're thinking as

01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:18.080
a screenwriter.

01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:19.080
Yeah, right.

01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:21.080
I like that you made a Shimali on an adjective.

01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:23.080
That was very nice.

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:32.560
It's a more Yiddish, I thought it was like, what's this, Michelle, you're being a Shimali

01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:33.560
on a gas.

01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:36.560
You're being an M Night Michigana right now.

01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:38.760
M Night Shimali gas.

01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:40.160
What's this M Night Shimali gas?

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:42.520
What do you have to have if they lived in a village?

01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:43.520
What did you tell them?

01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:44.520
Just live in a village.

01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:45.520
I don't know.

01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:46.520
This is a way to end the movie.

01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:48.120
She goes to a gas station.

01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:49.120
What water?

01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:53.400
No vases covered in water.

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.400
Swing away and then it's supposed to happen.

01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:56.400
I see dead people.

01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.640
I see dead people every day.

01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:00.640
I talk to them.

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:01.640
On the internet.

01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:02.640
I don't know what to do.

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:05.040
I go to my therapist.

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:08.240
My marriage has been dead for 35 years.

01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:10.240
You don't see me commencing about it.

01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:12.240
You know what I'm saying?

01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:16.920
It's hot in here.

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:19.280
M Night Michigana.

01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:21.120
M Night Michigana.

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:28.760
He's like the leery cable guy of horse-built horror humor.

01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:33.560
We could have kept it on the road, but I drove it off the cliff of anti-Semitism because

01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:40.040
it turned into like, oh, everybody, Jewish people are all old Jews that don't like humidity.

01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:42.360
As a Jewish person, it's a different kind of heat.

01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:43.360
You're Jewish.

01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:44.360
All right.

01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:45.360
Let's fucking do this.

01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:46.360
Different kind of heat.

01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:49.640
They say the coal is coming from inside the house.

01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:51.640
Of course, it's my wife.

01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:57.360
M Night Michigana is your rap to close the show up.

01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:58.360
All right.

01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:00.560
M Night Michigana rap.

01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:02.840
It's not a good idea for a rap.

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:06.880
It's the worst concept for a rap since lobster traps.

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:12.080
Let me tell you about the history of a trap that you will never see a lobster trap was

01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:13.080
a bucket.

01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.920
If you laid it on its side, the lobster'd say fuck it.

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:16.920
Go in backwards and go in it.

01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:18.920
Put your mama in an hour and a minute.

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:19.920
All right.

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:20.920
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:21.920
All right.

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:25.920
Let's give it up for our guest, Josh Androwski.

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:27.920
Well, yes, on Measure B.

01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:28.920
Yes, son.

01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:29.920
Thank you.

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:30.920
Participate in musical elections.

01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:31.920
Yes.

01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:32.920
Look into Measure B. Yeah.

01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:33.920
Do whatever.

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.920
And Google its concepts and have conversations about it.

01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:40.920
Let's give it up for everybody here at Harmontown.

01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:44.680
Kris Boruff, Steve Levy, Church, Knoll the Fabric, Zac McKeever.

01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:52.680
I'm Jeff, your Comptroller, your Game Master, Spencer Crittenden, and your mayor, Dan Pajamas

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:53.680
Harmon.

01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:54.680
Oh, no.

01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:55.680
What's happening?

01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:58.680
Thank you all for coming, everybody.

01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:22.680
Drive fast to take chances.
