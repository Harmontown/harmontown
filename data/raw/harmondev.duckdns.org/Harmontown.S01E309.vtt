{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:07.000\nLadies and gentlemen, I'm your Comptroller Jeff Davis. Glad to be back in town.\n\n00:07.000 --> 00:12.000\nIt is November 5th, 2018 and Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:20.000\nWe're going to start things off in a slightly different fashion.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:26.000\nA little bit of a departure from our normal intros before I introduce your Game Master and your Mayor.\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:32.000\nLet's please bring out the Solid Me Undies Dancers!\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:44.000\nYeah.\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:52.000\nYou're Game Master Spencer Crittenden, everybody.\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:59.000\nAnd the Mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:03.000\nThank you.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:18.000\nMe onesies, me onesies, me onesies, me undies as onesies, head to toe, wearing me undies the way you know,\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:21.000\nbut now the way you've never known them.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:37.000\nMe undies are growing from your shoulders to your groanum and your ankleum, soft as regular me undies, but hovering your body, which raises questions.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:43.000\nI'm wearing an undershirt right now and regular me undies under the me onesies.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:57.000\nBut if I wasn't wearing me undies underneath my me onesies, I have to wonder if I would just be rocking a constant, agitated, hard on.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:01.000\nYou're a stocking fetishist.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:06.000\nWell, look, everyone's a soft material dragged across your cocks fetishists.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:10.000\nEveryone.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:15.000\nI'm not going to segue into a wrap about this.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:20.000\nEveryone's a having cloth draped across your crock, apologist.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:21.000\nNot apologist.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:22.000\nFetishist.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:26.000\nI'm not defensive about any of my fetishes.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:39.000\nI'm just saying, like, I'm just saying, for me to say, look, we all know that the me undies material is made from a material, a space age, but what is it called, a replenishable?\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:43.000\nCompletely sustainably sourced.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:45.000\nSpace age fabric that's three times softer than cotton.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:47.000\nWe're talking about micro-model.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:48.000\nMicro-model.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:53.000\nAnd I got excited about me socks.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:54.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:57.000\nTurns out me socks are made of cotton.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:01.000\nIt's three times less soft than micro-model.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nI can see why they were hesitant.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:04.000\nThey never sent the me socks.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:09.000\nAnd meanwhile, I was worried, like, well, what if the me socks are also three times softer than cotton?\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:13.000\nIs this going to turn into an Ed Wood situation for me?\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:18.000\nBecause I'm a fan of women in comfortable fabrics.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:22.000\nAnd what if I wanted to take upon myself there?\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:25.000\nWhat if I got a taste of it and was like, you know what?\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:33.000\nWhat if this awakens something in me to paraphrase Dean Pelton from my hit show community?\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:39.000\nBut I'm draped head to toe in luxurious micro-model.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:48.000\nFor the non-stream subscriber, Dan and Spencer are wearing what can only be described as hoody to toe onesies right now.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:51.000\nThis looks like Christmas morning at...\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:53.000\nI assume these are called me onesies, right?\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:55.000\nI hope so.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:57.000\nDid you coin that, or is that what they're actually for?\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:58.000\nI don't know.\n\n03:58.000 --> 03:59.000\nI don't know.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:00.000\nProbably.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:01.000\nDid I coin it?\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:02.000\nI mean, yeah.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:03.000\nExactly.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:04.000\nYeah.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:07.000\nI mean, they probably had a long time to think about it.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:12.000\nAnyways, they're a sponsor, but look, I mean, we don't...\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:17.000\nIf Black and Decker sponsors the show, we're not going to come out here and drill...\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nThat would be amazing.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:20.000\nNow, Spencer...\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:21.000\nThat sounds like fun, though.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:22.000\nWe should do that.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nWell, maybe we would do it, and maybe that would be fun.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:25.000\nBecause that sounds great.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:29.000\nBut if it were worse, we wouldn't, because we have integrity.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:30.000\nRight.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:33.000\nSpencer, are you wearing anything underneath your me onesie?\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:34.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:35.000\nClothes.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:40.000\nSo you have a full outfit underneath your me onesie?\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nI'm wearing a three-piece suit.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:48.000\nI have the feeling that you're actually not wearing anything under that me onesie.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:49.000\nNo, no.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:53.000\nIt's legal.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:57.000\nI wonder about my nipples, because I'm wearing an undershirt, which I don't know if I would or wouldn't...\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nI wonder about your nipples, too, Dan.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:04.000\nIt's like, what if I had micromodal encasing my nipples?\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:05.000\nIt's not bad.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:08.000\nEvery time I rolled over in bed, it was sliding across it.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:09.000\nI don't know.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:10.000\nWhy don't Spencer and I talk for a bit?\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:15.000\nYou go backstage, just robe, and put your onesie on without anything on.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:16.000\nNo, no.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:17.000\nNot without...\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:18.000\nNo, that's not...\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:19.000\nThat's...\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:20.000\nNo.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nWhat are you afraid of?\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:24.000\nI'm concerned about...\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nThe show being bad.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:32.000\nI was about to say, I'm worried about what they're afraid of, but I don't want to go there because\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nthen you're going to go, what are you afraid of?\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:35.000\nRight, people?\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:38.000\nAnd everyone's going to go, we're not afraid of anything.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:46.000\nI'm afraid of what is a salt, whether they asked for it or not.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:47.000\nHow about this?\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:52.000\nI don't want them watching to see whether or not my little tiny fucking paneling nail\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:55.000\ncock starts to twitch and...\n\n05:55.000 --> 06:00.000\nThere comes a point when entertainment is worth no ticket price.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:01.000\nWhat about this?\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:05.000\nLeave your me undies under your me onesies on, but take the shirt off.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:06.000\nJust the shirt.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nLet's do a nipple experiment on your me onesies.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:10.000\nJust a nipple experiment.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:11.000\nLet's talk...\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nThere's just so much to talk about.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:18.000\nIt's such a crucial time right now, guys.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:24.000\nI mean, by the time this actually drops as a podcast, the time will be over.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:31.000\nBut right now, it's such an important time to let your voice be heard.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:40.000\nI'm talking about making sure that you leave a comment under a famous person's Instagram.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:45.000\nLetting them know why you don't vote.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:51.000\nHow dare Judd Apatow post a reminder that it's time to vote.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:58.000\nYou don't let your voice be heard explain to him why democracy doesn't work anymore.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nHe's asking for it.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:03.000\nAnd more importantly, what if...\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\nWhat if you didn't say anything?\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nOh, no.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:09.000\nOh, my God.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:12.000\nThe system would walk all over you.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:16.000\nFamous people would remind everyone to vote.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nEveryone would vote whether they wanted to or not\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nfor whoever the fuck they wanted to.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:24.000\nYou have to let freedom ring.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:29.000\nThis is your one chance to lend your voice to an outcry\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:35.000\nwithout risking your voice actually becoming a part of anyone else's voice\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:39.000\nbecause this is about you, after all.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:44.000\nPlease write a three-paragraph theme under everyone's Instagram.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:52.000\nHow long, Alyssa Milano, must we live under the cruel tyranny of me following you on Instagram?\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:59.000\nWhat do you mean, rock the vote, Sebastian Cabot?\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nIs he still...\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nIs his Instagram still alive?\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:04.000\nYeah.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:11.000\nI'm like, you know, everybody look, our culture has obviously become about, you know,\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:15.000\nas everybody knows, like when I was in high school, we would have a thing, a Milwaukee.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:20.000\nYou, like, stand in the parking lot of the McDonald's.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:24.000\nAnd Jerry's...\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:27.000\nOr it's a stranger, it's probably a stranger because otherwise you wouldn't do this.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:32.000\nBut somebody's Camaro goes by and they go...\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nAnd they peel their tires.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:37.000\nAnd then what do you do in response to the tires peeling,\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:41.000\nregardless of how many people are around you and how much they value their eardrums,\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nthis Camaro has committed a crime.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:48.000\nSo now your duty as a champion of the people and their peace and quiet is to go...\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:52.000\nEw, you're so cool!\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:57.000\nAnd then probably possibly maybe someone who heard you do that could open their apartment window\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:00.000\nand go, hey, some people have to work in the morning.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:05.000\nAnd then maybe someone who lives on the roof of that person's building could be like,\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:10.000\nit must be nice to have a job!\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:14.000\nSays the pigeon master.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:21.000\nThe weird off-brand crow archetype who emerged with the spirit of pigeons\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:29.000\nbecause he wasn't quite very wrongfully murdered.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nIt's endemic to our culture.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:37.000\nSocial media has only exasperated this feeling that if you just let a day go by\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:41.000\nwithout letting people know how fucking unique you are,\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:46.000\na landslide might happen of mediocrity, unremarkability.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:53.000\nYou might get subsumed in just mayonnaise and like...\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:58.000\nYou'll wake up tomorrow and you'll be like, I should have said something yesterday.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:02.000\nIt's probably not true.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:08.000\nI think if anything, isn't it nice that the celebrities now are simply saying vote?\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nThey're not saying...\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:13.000\nBecause they really do just want you to vote.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:19.000\nHere's a spare thought for some of these people that are asking you to remind you to vote.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:23.000\nThey maybe even know that you're not going to vote.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:34.000\nThey're simply making one last fucking deal with whatever deity they worship.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:38.000\nI gotta say something so I can sleep like a baby.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nRemember Pontius Pilate?\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:43.000\nHe was like...\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:51.000\nNobody remembers Pontius Pilate harder than my personal trainer.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:55.000\nIt was really hard on him personally.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:57.000\nHe was surprised.\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nHe was like, I think I'm going to get it.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:02.000\nIt's possible that someone that says to you,\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:05.000\nby the way, don't forget tomorrow's Waddle-a-day,\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:09.000\nthat before you go, you know what?\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:12.000\nHere's the thing about that.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:15.000\nI'm not going to do it because here's why.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:20.000\nYou might be talking to the one person left who's still talking to you.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:24.000\nYou might be shooting a messenger.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:29.000\nCody and I were watching...\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:33.000\nWe were listening to a podcast about...\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:36.000\nIt was another horror podcast with some horror narrative.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:40.000\nIn a lot of these stories, people will...\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:45.000\nThey go through a ghost story and it'll resolve in...\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:49.000\nWhat are you laughing at?\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:53.000\nDon't tell me I'm not dressed the way...\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nI'm just saying.\n\n11:55.000 --> 12:00.000\nI don't know whether wearing jammies during a tirade helps or hurts.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nIt definitely is good.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:09.000\nWe look like spokesmodels for a new kind of gum drop from Europe, right?\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:12.000\nMuchenglubans.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:15.000\nPeople like us are like, give me some of them.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nMuchenglubans.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:22.000\nMiwonsi should come out with a gubernatorial brand of Miwonsi.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:26.000\nIt's a suspender so you could tuck your thumbs into it.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nWhat is with you millennials and hoods?\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nOh, boy.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:34.000\nWhy are you millennials so hood-accepting?\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:37.000\nThey're good.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nWear a hat, you jack-offs.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:42.000\nNo one has ever done anything bad wearing a hood.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:48.000\nWould a Generation X invest too much in peripheral vision and...\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:51.000\nFuck you, space children.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nIt's hard to...

No.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:21.000\nI'm saying, like, well, maybe it starts to haunt the firehouse.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nAnd I'm like, wait, so a firehouse ghost isn't an idiom?\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:26.000\nLike, it's not an expression,\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nbecause it definitely should be.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:31.000\nAnd she's like, no, yeah, no, it's not an idiom.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nAnd she's like, no, yeah, no, I'm saying, like,\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nmaybe it was like a firehouse ghost.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:38.000\nIt just, like, leaps off the page as, like, an actual expression.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:42.000\nEspecially right now, a firehouse ghost\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:45.000\nit's sort of related to shooting the messenger.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nIt's like, whoa, man, listen,\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nit's like if you're protesting together\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:53.000\nand you're like, fuck, we don't want Nazis to take over America.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nFuck that.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:58.000\nAnd then someone tears you and goes, excuse me,\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:01.000\nare your boots gluten-free?\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:04.000\nAnd you're like, fuck you, bitch.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nFuck, bitch, I don't beg your pardon.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nAnd they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, guys,\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nyou're haunting the firehouse.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:15.000\nYou're frightening the only people\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:18.000\nthat are available to frighten.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:21.000\nNobody that we're trying to fight\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:24.000\ngives a fuck what you're talking about.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:27.000\nGet your signs back up in the air\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:30.000\nand stop being firehouse ghosts.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nOh.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nAnyways, well, I didn't mean to make the example political.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:37.000\nI just thought that it was a fun link.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nI spent the last 45 seconds\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\ntrying to think of a song by the band Firehouse\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nand I couldn't think of any.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nGhost.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:48.000\nMan, you're kind of haunting the firehouse right now, man.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.000\nLike, who cares if he used the wrong pronoun?\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nLike, he's totally on your side.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nFirehouses haunt themselves, bro.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:57.000\nWell, actually, you know, like...\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nPut the hose down, man.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nI still like to imagine like firefighters,\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nlike, that's just the thing they have to deal with all the time.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:06.000\nThey're like, look, I mean, if we were going to let\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:09.000\nfirehouse ghosts like scare us out of the firehouse,\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nwe wouldn't be very good firemen.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nFire people, so.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nOr is that a Ghostbusters reference because they,\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:18.000\nGhostbusters work outside of a fire station.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:21.000\nRight, well, that's a dumb dot to connect.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nLet's move on.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nYou should be ashamed of yourself.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:28.000\nOh, oh, I took it too far, huh?\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:29.000\nI like it.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nIt's just a, it's just in a

was haunted.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nYeah, but it was a comedy in 1983.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nIt's not like...\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nJust Jeff.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.000\nLet's

Thank you.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nDo you want some liquor?\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:49.000\nDo we give it according to need?\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:53.000\nYou're looking extra marx-y right now.\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:57.000\nIt's like slumber party marks.\n\n29:57.000 --> 30:00.000\nWell, I probably look like slumber party Hitler, too, though.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nI look like slumber party anybody.\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nNo, not with that beard.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nYou have to get rid of most of your facial hair.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nYou were talking about, since I last saw you,\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nmy beard maybe got busier.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:13.000\nWell, less Hitler, like, certainly.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nI'm interested if Hitler had a beard.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nI think he would have been way cooler.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nFor God's sake.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nIt says a lot about you that you're like,\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:24.000\nI'm going to have one little fucking square of hair on my face,\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nand that's it.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:29.000\nThat's the worst thing he ever did.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nI've been good.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:35.000\nAmong his biggest crimes, facial hair.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nYes. Thank you.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:39.000\nI do wonder about that mustache,\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nbecause obviously the thing we know,\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\na lot of make things come to mind is chaplain,\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nbut so we know there must have been some fucking thing\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:47.000\nthat people did back then.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nGas masks in World War I,\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nyou couldn't have a long, wide mustache\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:54.000\nbecause it would break the seal on the gas mask and the trenches.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:57.000\nThe fashion for short mustaches became a thing\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nwhere you could seal the gas mask around your mouth.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nThat seems very...\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nThat seems very logical,\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:06.000\nbut it seems like the kind of logic that ultimately is like...\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nIt's like when people go like,\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nyou know the word fuck stands for\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nfor use of carnal knowledge,\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nand they used to tattoo it on witches.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:16.000\nI'm like, that rings logical,\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:19.000\nbut it also doesn't ring with the kind of organic truth\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nthat most true things turn out to have.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nIt almost sounds a little overwrought.\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nIt doesn't explain why Michael Jordan\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nhad a Hitler mustache in the Haynes commercials.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:30.000\nUnless he was going ham on that gas mask bong.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nOh shit.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nName a better reason.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nYeah, all right.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:39.000\nDo we believe of mankind, for instance?\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nAnd in this case, I truly mean mankind,\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:44.000\nlike that mustache fashion would\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:47.000\nacquiesce to gas\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nmasquerade in functionality\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:52.000\nwhile still, like, would people be that insistent\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\non a mustache that they would be like,\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:57.000\nwell, there's got to be some mustache there.\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:00.000\nThat was also a mustache style pre-World War I,\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nbut that became a more functional mustache.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nOh, okay. All right.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nSo it gained popularity because...\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nIt gained functionality.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nLike, if you were a fighter...\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:12.000\nIt gained popularity because of the functionality.\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:15.000\nSo you keep pretending that you're correcting me.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nWe're talking about the same thing.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:18.000\nYou fucking son of a bitch.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:20.000\nOh, you're haunting the firehouse, bro.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nBut we're...\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\nOh, no.\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nGod damn it.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:29.000\nJosh, I was saving that one\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nfor later in the show.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nI'm so sorry.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nYou loved it right up.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nThat was a big mistake to save it, I think.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nThat's like a cookie on a...\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nI mean, not to undermine your use of it.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nHe did it perfectly.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nBut it was pretty easy.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nBut I don't want to harp on this,\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nbut I have these questions.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:52.000\nThey're also answerable through Wikipedia, probably.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:54.000\nBut what do you type in?\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nHitler mustache?\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.000\nThe chaplain?\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nIt's like, what is that fucking stripe?\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nNow we have this insight\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:05.000\nthat maybe it got signal boosted as a mustache.\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:08.000\nWhereas it was gas mask compatible.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nPlease retweet this mustache.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nPlease, signal boost.\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nBut at some point still, people are like,\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nGod knows why any mustache would ever...\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:19.000\nI mean, we all know from playing role-playing games,\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:22.000\nvideo games, that there's a million kinds of mustache.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\nHell yeah.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:27.000\nHow do any of them gain any kind of favor?\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:31.000\nAlso going to any bar or restaurant in Silver Lake.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:36.000\nSo we got to send Malcolm Gladwell to Squirrel\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:41.000\nto discover how mustaches sociologically get better.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:46.000\nJosh, what has happened since we saw you last,\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:49.000\nmaybe personally or politically,\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nI don't know, take it anywhere you want to.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:54.000\nSo I'll take it politically,\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:56.000\nbecause that's what I've been sort of...\n\n33:56.000 --> 34:01.000\nSo I guess I should say first\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:05.000\nthat I won a million dollars on a slot machine.\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nOh, right.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:11.000\nYeah, I won a million dollars on a Big Bang Theory slot machine.\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:16.000\nThat's a real thing that happened to me.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nI think that was something that we didn't talk about,\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nbut that was true last time we saw you,\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nbecause you didn't then give it all away,\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:23.000\nwhich would undermine your...\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nI gave half of it away.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:26.000\nI did.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nAny Elon Musk could fucking take that to the bank.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:33.000\nYou won a million dollars on a Big Bang Theory slot machine,\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nand gave half of it away.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nSo they're like friends and family in various organizations\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nbecause nobody should hoard that much well?\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:42.000\nAnd how much did they socket to you for luxury tax on that?\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nOh, boy, way more than...\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nIt's got to be like half, right?\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nYeah, and then the slot machine corporation\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\ncuts off a chunk for them.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:51.000\nThey got to have a taste.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:55.000\nI don't know why, but they cut off like six figures.\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:56.000\nThey have a taste.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:57.000\nShut up, not really.\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:58.000\nNo, for real.\n\n34:58.000 --> 34:59.000\nNo, shut up.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:00.000\nI swear to God.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nWell, we made the machine that made the money.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\nWhat they...\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:07.000\nYes, which is how Elon Musk gets rich.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nYou think it was cheap to get Chuck Lorre to agree\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:12.000\nto put Big Bang Theory's face on this machine?\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:13.000\nIt didn't go to Chuck.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:14.000\nI checked.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:15.000\nI'm a millionaire now.\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:16.000\nI can talk to him.\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:23.000\nNo, they said that what we promised you was the annuity.\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:29.000\nSo you get like $50,000 for X amount of years.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:33.000\nAnd it ended up being until I was like 55 or 60 or something.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nAnd I was like, there's not going to be a Nevada then.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:38.000\nGive me all of it right now.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:41.000\nAnd they're like, all right, well, we got to cut off six figures\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:42.000\nfor ourselves.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nAnd that's the deal.\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.000\nTo get the lump sum.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.000\nThat is such a fucking...\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nI know, don't you feel so bad for me?\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:51.000\nAlso...\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:54.000\nWell, we do because they should...\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:58.000\nBecause a million fucking dollars should come out of the thing\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:00.000\nand knowing that that can't happen,\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:05.000\nthat the fucking check that comes out should be...\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:08.000\nYou should be able to take it to a giant foam bank and like...\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:09.000\nYes.\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nThe ghost of Ed McMahon is there.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:12.000\nIt sucks.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:15.000\nBut it's also uplifting actually to learn that like if you do win\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:19.000\nlike a bunch of money in a contest that actually it is...\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:24.000\nIt's like basically like as cool as getting a massive\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:27.000\nunearned promotion at your dishwashing job.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:30.000\nAnd that it only like actually...\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:31.000\nThat there's like four...\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:32.000\nEvery year.\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:33.000\nYeah.\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:34.000\nYeah, that would be cool.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:35.000\nSo Josh, I have a question.\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:36.000\nYes.\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nI have friends that have won much smaller amounts,\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nbut still big amounts of money like on slots.\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:41.000\nRight.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:44.000\nDid they guilt you into tipping them really largely?\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:45.000\nOh, they didn't have to.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:46.000\nThat was the first fucking thing.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.000\nI was like, give me all this money.\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:50.000\nI just want to walk around and give people a hundred dollar bills\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:54.000\nbecause like how often do you get to radically confront\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:57.000\nyour own value system?\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:58.000\nRight?\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:03.000\nLike I am a self-proclaimed card carrying socialist.\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:06.000\nSo it was like, all right, I have to literally put my money\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:09.000\nwhere my mouth is now.\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:14.000\nSo like that part of it that was like could have been a Larry David\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:15.000\nlike what did you do to deserve...\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:17.000\nI was like, what did I do to deserve this?\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:20.000\nSo I was just like, I'm the money man.\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:24.000\nI wanted to get a suit with question marks all over it.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:28.000\nLike free money for me.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:33.000\nI'm assuming after all of those take-aways and all that stuff\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:36.000\nthat you still ended up six figures up.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nYeah, under 500,000.\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:41.000\nI just got for being a dude.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:44.000\nWas this a high stakes game you were playing?\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:47.000\nNo, it was a penny slot, my man.\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:50.000\nSorry, I'm hung up on something else.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:53.000\nYou know that suit has dollar signs on it, not question marks.\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:56.000\nIf it was question marks, it would be the Joker.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\nThe Riddler.\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:01.000\nMatthew Lesko had the exclamation points over the dollar signs.\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:04.000\nThe real estate guy, he looks like the Riddler\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nbut he has dollar signs, right?\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:08.000\nMatthew Lesko is his name.\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:10.000\nI know that from being super stoned and watching TV.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:13.000\nYou're not the first person that goes like oh I got question marks\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:17.000\nIt's like, God, if I created the Riddler, I'd be so mad.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:18.000\nQuestion marks.\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:20.000\nWait, really?\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:21.000\nVindicated.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nWait, he can't do that?\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:24.000\nNo you can't.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:25.000\nNo you can't.\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nYou're probably fine with him doing that.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:30.000\nI'm mad.\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:32.000\nIntellectual property.\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:35.000\nThat could be money out of my pocket if I was in the different...\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:36.000\nYeah, you're right.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:37.000\nNo, he's got question marks.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:41.000\nThen I'm a double villain for cutting off this conversation.\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nNo, I'm happy that we proved me right.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:44.000\nThat rules.\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:45.000\nI love it.\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nBut I also have to go back to the Rick and Morty writer's room\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:49.000\nbecause this is actually a running joke in the room\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:56.000\nand the butt of the joke is someone who we thought misappropriated.\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:00.000\nWait, did you have an elaborate joke?\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.000\nI have to send three text messages when I get off the stage\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:03.000\nand eat a lot of shit.\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:05.000\nDid you have an elaborate joke premise that just came true\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.000\nbefore your very eyes?\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:08.000\nIt came false I think.\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:12.000\nNo, no, no. We had an in-joke.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:15.000\nWe were having a conversation that somehow touched on that guy\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:18.000\nand then the person who described him as having question marks\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:23.000\nall over his suit was mocked, ridiculed, tarred, feathered\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:26.000\nbecause none of us looked it up on the internet\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:30.000\nand all of us agreed just from our understanding of\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:36.000\nfucking property, IP law, that there must have been dollar signs\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:40.000\nto fuck you, how could you confuse them for the riddler, you idiot.\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:46.000\nAnd I need to buy that person a dog or something now.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:48.000\nThat's a fair barter.\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:51.000\nI feel like they're owed a dog.\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:55.000\nSo Josh, you're in a casino, you're in Vegas, right?\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nYes, Las Vegas.\n\n39:57.000 --> 40:01.000\nAnd you're a card-carrying socialist.\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:06.000\nAnd what is the impetus to sit down and play slots as a socialist?\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:10.000\nBecause I'm going to steal this money from the system\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:13.000\nand appropriate it to the masses?\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:16.000\nIt's the only honest form of capitalism.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:19.000\nIt's the only honest industry in capitalism is gambling\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:22.000\nbecause everybody knows you're going to get fucked.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:26.000\nWhen you enter into it, they're like, yes, we're going to fuck you.\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:30.000\nAnd you're like, cool, I'd love a limerita.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:33.000\nYou get free drinks while you're doing it.\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:36.000\nAnd the idea is that the lottery is...\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:40.000\nI wouldn't be surprised in a socialist society or an anarchist society\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:43.000\neven depending on the type of anarchy that lotteries would happen\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:48.000\ngiven that they often use them to fund schools and stuff, right?\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:53.000\nWell, I mean, I don't know if there's fascist lotteries like the Shirley Jackson one.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nWe've got to stay away from those.\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nNo, that could be good, though.\n\n40:57.000 --> 41:01.000\nI mean, I'm not a conspiracy guy, but do you think that people at the casino\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:04.000\ngo, OK, we've got a real socialist candidate?\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:07.000\nI mean, look at him. He's dressed like McGyver.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\nHe goes on podcasts, he's got a platform.\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:14.000\nLet's make this socialist rich on casino capitalist money.\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:15.000\nGuess what he's going to do?\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:18.000\nGo on all these podcasts and talk about...\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:20.000\nWhat was the casino?\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:22.000\nThe El Cortez.\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:26.000\nYeah, now everyone's going to go to the El Cortez.\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:32.000\nBut, you know, it could be really good for us if you wanted at the Meundies casino.\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:34.000\nYou know, you see what I'm doing here?\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:35.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:39.000\nThe messaging between socialism and casinos have the...\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nIt's not incompatible messaging.\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:46.000\nBoth billboards say, hey, poor, wishing you weren't,\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:49.000\ncome to a place that everyone like you comes.\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:55.000\nRight, except for in socialism when it's done as, like, written as you're supposed to do it.\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nNo one's supposed to win a jackpot.\n\n41:57.000 --> 42:00.000\nWell, but also nobody's supposed to go bust.\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:05.000\nIt would be like everybody ties and then sometimes you win and that's cool too.\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\nRight, they don't put that on the billboards though.\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:08.000\nThey don't go.\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:12.000\nYou might not go broke and end up sucking dick for crack.\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:15.000\nYeah, I mean, you're not gonna.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nThat's a promise.\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nYou still can.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:20.000\nIf you want to.\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:26.000\nYeah, what if you can provide dick sucking and you need coke?\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:27.000\nRight?\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:28.000\nThat's communism.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:29.000\nThat's communism.\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.000\nThat's bartering, my man.\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:34.000\nThat's the new economy.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:37.000\nThat's what Marx calls seizing the means of production.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nThat's according to my needs.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nWe're slipping into this trope though where we do,\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:45.000\nwe always do this in political conversation where we tend to,\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:52.000\nI'm gonna make up a new phrase in my drunkenness, we hyper-rise every ideology\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:55.000\nbecause what we want to do is we want to go like,\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:59.000\nwell, the socialist is grabbing some potato chips, I see.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:07.000\nWhen the reality, I would say is, come on, we've succeeded as a nation\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:12.000\nby blending the right ideologies and the right ratios\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:18.000\nand we fail when we get tempted by, somebody grabs the conscience,\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:22.000\nlike we need to fucking step on the faces of everyone who thinks\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:25.000\nthat they're entitled to a fucking dollar that someone else made\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:30.000\nand it's like that, that's one gas pedal that can get pressed\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:33.000\nthat fucks things up for everybody in the long term.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:37.000\nAnd maybe arguably another gas pedal, though I don't know in the history of this country,\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nwe've repressed it so hard that we've been threatened,\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:42.000\nI think a lot of people would say we have,\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:47.000\nbut the opposite idea is also a terrible idea,\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:51.000\nlike the idea that, hey, everybody come over here and don't,\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:54.000\nwell, if you're feeling weak, just follow your instincts\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:57.000\nand line up and hang out, we got your back\n\n43:57.000 --> 44:03.000\nand the fear is that that's gonna, oh, where are our Alex P. Catons,\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:07.000\nwho among us will remember how to be savage?\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:10.000\nRight, yeah, they're bored with an ale in it.\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:13.000\nBut the truth, I mean, we all learned in history class that it's good, come on,\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:17.000\nwe go through, like the fucking shit happens, like oil plummets through the floor,\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:22.000\nlike nations go into crisis and then presidents rise up and say,\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:26.000\neveryone's gotta get a job or you're gonna do this for free,\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:30.000\nlike these moments of historical inspiration where we blend these concepts\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:35.000\nand then we have these words that excite people, socialism, communism,\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:42.000\nyou know, like it's, come on, we have so much socialism in our country right now.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:44.000\nYeah, it works for everybody.\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:50.000\nYeah, yeah, like the trash people and like all these things like municipal services.\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:51.000\nTaxes.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:52.000\nYeah, well.\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:53.000\nThe police.\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:57.000\nI mean, those are the, not great ones.\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:58.000\nLibraries.\n\n44:58.000 --> 44:59.000\nFire department.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:00.000\nYeah, those ones are better.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:04.000\nThe police that we have are better than a privatized police force.\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:05.000\nYes.\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nThe garbage, the garbage service is better.\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:08.000\nYou know, like we definitely.\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:09.000\nRobocop proved it.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:14.000\nPeople, the hardest core conservative is not gonna start arguing with you\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:19.000\nthat he thinks that 12 garbage trucks should show up and argue with each other\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:21.000\nabout who gets to take his garbage away from his house.\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nHe just wants his fucking garbage taken away, et cetera.\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:24.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:28.000\nAnd well, actually to talk about what I'm working on right now,\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:32.000\nbecause I have all this free time now, I've devoted like it all to something called\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:34.000\nMeasure B.\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:35.000\nYou've definitely heard of it.\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:38.000\nHow many other people have heard of Measure B?\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nOkay, that's cool.\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nIt is a very small campaign.\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nThere's only a few of us working on it right now.\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:49.000\nBut essentially what it does is you were talking about privatization basically, right?\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:55.000\nLike the idea of like, oh yeah, let's just let people whose motive is to make as much\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:59.000\nmoney as possible, decide things that matter in people's lives.\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:00.000\nRight.\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:03.000\nAnd the things that are ostensibly, sorry to derail you for a second,\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:07.000\nbut the things that are ostensibly foundational to the pursuit of happiness.\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:08.000\nRight.\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:09.000\nEducation, medicine.\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:10.000\nRight.\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:11.000\nYeah, that's where we get into these debates.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:12.000\nBecause it's like, well, wait a minute.\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:18.000\nIs it part of being an American to, if you cut off your thumb, be able to get it reattached\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:22.000\nor is it, is that something that only Mr. Howell on Gilligan's Island can have\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:25.000\nand Ginger can't because she hasn't made enough coconuts yet?\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:26.000\nYeah.\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:32.000\nThat was a TV show in the 1970s.\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:35.000\nMr. Howell was rich and so Gilligan did stuff for him.\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:39.000\nIt didn't make a lot of sense because Ginger was a movie star.\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:42.000\nI guess she just didn't bring enough money in her suitcase.\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:45.000\nIt's like, don't you think Mr. Howell is going to be like, I'm good for it.\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:46.000\nLovey.\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:47.000\nYeah.\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:48.000\nAll right.\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:49.000\nContinue.\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:50.000\nSorry.\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:51.000\nShe could have used Measure B.\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nBut education may be sliding into that.\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:58.000\nSo, well, yeah, so, well, another thing that slots into that is finance, is money, is just\n\n46:58.000 --> 46:59.000\nthe idea.\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:03.000\nI think we talked about this one of the last times you were on is like the financing of\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nthe government that the banks are involved in.\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:06.000\nSorry.\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\nOh, this is the credit union versus...\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:09.000\nEssentially.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:11.000\nSo it's the idea of like a for-profit bank versus a public bank.\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:13.000\nMeasure B would be the first step towards a public bank.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:15.000\nYou get a groan from that guy.\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:17.000\nI thought that was a gasp.\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:18.000\nOh, it might be.\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:19.000\nI don't know.\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.000\nHe'd let out a bunch of, he's like, oh.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:22.000\nHe deflated.\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:23.000\nYeah.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:24.000\nContinue, sir.\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:29.500\nSo basically what happens now is when you go and buy an ice cream cone, the city puts\n\n47:29.500 --> 47:34.320\nyour tax dollars in a private bank and that private bank uses your tax money to finance\n\n47:34.320 --> 47:43.680\ninvestments in oil pipelines, in guns, in cigarettes, private prisons, including the\n\n47:43.680 --> 47:47.000\nvery cages that separate undocumented children from their families.\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:48.500\nDesicrating native lands.\n\n47:48.500 --> 47:49.500\nOh, absolutely.\n\n47:49.500 --> 47:50.500\nThey love doing that shit.\n\n47:50.500 --> 47:51.500\nThey can't get enough of it.\n\n47:51.500 --> 47:56.880\nGuys, if all of this happened every time I bought an ice cream cone, the planet would\n\n47:56.880 --> 47:57.880\nbe over.\n\n47:57.880 --> 48:01.280\nOh, but it is.\n\n48:01.280 --> 48:07.560\nAnd also the government needs to get financing from banks to do governmental stuff like building\n\n48:07.560 --> 48:08.560\na park.\n\n48:08.560 --> 48:12.720\nAnd the banks can say, hey, we're not going to let you build this park and give you the\n\n48:12.720 --> 48:16.640\nmoney unless you make burning children legal.\n\n48:16.640 --> 48:24.640\nOr they charge a much higher interest on student loans and on credit card loans.\n\n48:24.640 --> 48:30.840\nYou understand interest payments are fucked and it's just extracting labor from people.\n\n48:30.840 --> 48:35.600\nLiterally blackmailing the government because they realized they had the power to do so.\n\n48:35.600 --> 48:41.200\nAnd since that happened, we've dealt with these horrible problems coming from money\n\n48:41.200 --> 48:45.360\nnot being in line with what the public needs for a society.\n\n48:45.360 --> 48:49.160\nAnd it plays into economic crises, right?\n\n48:49.160 --> 48:54.480\nBecause banks, and this is kind of shocking, they can just straight up lend out like 90%\n\n48:54.480 --> 49:01.440\nof their deposits to anything that they want, which is a pretty obvious flaw right staring\n\n49:01.440 --> 49:08.520\nat you in the system that everybody just agrees is fine, that you can lend out 90% of the\n\n49:08.520 --> 49:09.520\nmoney you have.\n\n49:09.520 --> 49:10.520\nLike if I...\n\n49:10.520 --> 49:11.520\nLook into the usury.\n\n49:11.520 --> 49:12.520\nYeah.\n\n49:12.520 --> 49:13.520\nLook into it.\n\n49:13.520 --> 49:14.520\nYeah, okay.\n\n49:14.520 --> 49:21.960\nThe FDIC is hopefully trying to help banks not come into problems where they don't have\n\n49:21.960 --> 49:26.920\nthe money to when there's like a massive run on the banks, but it won't let go so far.\n\n49:26.920 --> 49:30.520\nThe FDIC is just taxpayers bailing out people.\n\n49:30.520 --> 49:38.000\nSo every time basically we finance all of this gambling that these total translucent\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:41.800\nsideways blinking millionaire dudes in New York, these are not my real beliefs, I'm\n\n49:41.800 --> 49:43.880\njust exaggerating for comedic effects.\n\n49:43.880 --> 49:44.880\nIt's real beliefs.\n\n49:44.880 --> 49:48.200\nI'm not going to like make a hard left turn and like everyone's a lizard.\n\n49:48.200 --> 49:51.960\nOnly an elite class of super lizards that go from above.\n\n49:51.960 --> 49:55.360\nIf everyone was a lizard, the lizard agenda would be undermined.\n\n49:55.360 --> 49:58.800\nSome fucking asshole that was born into a specific family that makes them a billionaire\n\n49:58.800 --> 50:03.040\nis profiting off of the literal worst things in the world and we are subsidizing our own\n\n50:03.040 --> 50:04.040\nextinction.\n\n50:04.040 --> 50:05.040\nRight.\n\n50:05.040 --> 50:08.840\nMeasure B is the first step to stop that because instead it would not extract all this money\n\n50:08.840 --> 50:13.920\nfrom the Los Angeles economy, it would keep it in the Los Angeles economy and invest it\n\n50:13.920 --> 50:17.160\nspecifically in things that we deem are good, right?\n\n50:17.160 --> 50:25.800\nAnd so right now City Hall is like really taking our lead, which is fucking weird.\n\n50:25.800 --> 50:26.800\nEverybody wants it.\n\n50:26.800 --> 50:28.320\nDoesn't the police union want it?\n\n50:28.320 --> 50:29.320\nYeah.\n\n50:29.320 --> 50:30.320\nEverybody.\n\n50:30.320 --> 50:31.320\nIt's kind of important for California, right?\n\n50:31.320 --> 50:36.400\nBecause we basically as a state, correct me if I'm wrong, California, it kind of like\n\n50:36.400 --> 50:40.240\nthere's a lot of back and forth where it's like we give the landlord this much and the\n\n50:40.240 --> 50:44.600\nlandlord owes us this much and blah, blah, blah, but we're basically at this point in\n\n50:44.600 --> 50:50.160\ntime unless I'm wrong, it kind of all comes out even, meaning that now more than ever\n\n50:50.160 --> 50:54.040\nCalifornia has that sort of power to be like, you know what?\n\n50:54.040 --> 50:55.040\nYes.\n\n50:55.040 --> 50:56.040\nYeah.\n\n50:56.040 --> 50:59.480\nCalifornia's not in as much debt as it was like 10 years ago and right now is the exact\n\n50:59.480 --> 51:04.240\ntime because of that sort of economic leverage for Californian cities to start doing this\n\n51:04.240 --> 51:06.240\nkind of thing.\n\n51:06.240 --> 51:14.080\nActually, what happens now is it's about $1.1 billion a year that we owe to banks for the\n\n51:14.080 --> 51:19.440\nprivilege of propping up their horrible industries and letting them profit off of this.\n\n51:19.440 --> 51:22.040\nWe owe them $1.3 billion a year.\n\n51:22.040 --> 51:24.360\nThose are service charges and wasted money.\n\n51:24.360 --> 51:25.360\nYeah.\n\n51:25.360 --> 51:26.360\nInterest and fees and shit like that.\n\n51:26.360 --> 51:29.960\nRight now, this is a fucking insane thing, but you're like, oh, it's 2018, that makes\n\n51:29.960 --> 51:30.960\nsense.\n\n51:30.960 --> 51:38.400\n50% of all infrastructure money in California right now goes directly to a banker's pocket.\n\n51:38.400 --> 51:41.040\nThat's like way too much percent.\n\n51:41.040 --> 51:42.040\nThat's yeah.\n\n51:42.040 --> 51:43.040\nYou know what I mean?\n\n51:43.040 --> 51:44.040\nThat's 50% too much.\n\n51:44.040 --> 51:45.040\nYeah.\n\n51:45.040 --> 51:48.400\nWe should probably, we're on a good roll here.\n\n51:48.400 --> 51:50.520\nWe've got the audience's attention, of course.\n\n51:50.520 --> 51:51.520\nThey love it.\n\n51:51.520 --> 51:55.920\nI'm a ringmaster.\n\n51:55.920 --> 52:03.800\nMy profit relies on me keeping these people locked into my addiction to my content.\n\n52:03.800 --> 52:06.440\nSome of them might be going, hey, Dan, what are you doing?\n\n52:06.440 --> 52:11.120\nWhat are you just feeding me a bunch of numbers and a bunch of stuff?\n\n52:11.120 --> 52:12.280\nHere's the thing though.\n\n52:12.280 --> 52:13.440\nWe're going to wrap it.\n\n52:13.440 --> 52:17.240\nWe're going to disguise it in a little entertainment.\n\n52:17.240 --> 52:24.640\nWe're going to do a little, I'm going to be a glit glop, the bank.\n\n52:24.640 --> 52:30.800\nI'm listening.\n\n52:30.800 --> 52:34.520\nI need you to do more than listen because I need your help really badly.\n\n52:34.520 --> 52:36.000\nI don't know how to.\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:37.000\nSo you're a bank.\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:39.960\nWell, I just, I want to make this, I want to make this, I want to wrap this in a narrative\n\n52:39.960 --> 52:44.920\nand make it entertaining and provide you with a platform so you can be like, I don't want\n\n52:44.920 --> 52:50.400\nto spoil it, but I foresee you going like, hey, glit glop, you can't take 21% of that\n\n52:50.400 --> 52:51.400\nor whatever.\n\n52:51.400 --> 52:56.360\nLike we put it on a spoon with some gumdrops on it and we fucking like, you know, you're\n\n52:56.360 --> 52:58.000\ntopping from the bottom right now.\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:04.920\nAnd what if, what if there's a fun character called MCB, like for measure B?\n\n53:04.920 --> 53:05.920\nAll right.\n\n53:05.920 --> 53:06.920\nMeasure B.\n\n53:06.920 --> 53:07.920\nYeah.\n\n53:07.920 --> 53:08.920\nMCB could be the spokesperson.\n\n53:08.920 --> 53:09.920\nRight.\n\n53:09.920 --> 53:11.400\nOf glit glop, the bank.\n\n53:11.400 --> 53:13.000\nHe's the spokesperson of the situation.\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:14.000\nWell, glit glop's the bank.\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:17.120\nNo, glit glop's probably a bad person because he's a bank, right?\n\n53:17.120 --> 53:18.120\nOh, okay.\n\n53:18.120 --> 53:19.280\nSo MCB is our Greek chorus.\n\n53:19.280 --> 53:20.280\nRight.\n\n53:20.280 --> 53:21.280\nMore or less.\n\n53:21.280 --> 53:22.280\nYeah.\n\n53:22.280 --> 53:26.720\nYou guys are having a bad situation and he shows you that there's a better way.\n\n53:26.720 --> 53:27.720\nMeasure B.\n\n53:27.720 --> 53:28.720\nAll right.\n\n53:28.720 --> 53:29.720\nAll right.\n\n53:29.720 --> 53:30.720\nAll right.\n\n53:30.720 --> 53:32.240\nSo I'm like a customer and I'm upset with the bank.\n\n53:32.240 --> 53:36.560\nCan my name be Josh still or does it have to be like, 12 Bill Steen?\n\n53:36.560 --> 53:37.560\nYeah, yeah, of course.\n\n53:37.560 --> 53:38.560\nI don't know.\n\n53:38.560 --> 53:39.560\nNo, Josh is great.\n\n53:39.560 --> 53:40.560\nOkay.\n\n53:40.560 --> 53:41.560\nBut I'm glit glop.\n\n53:41.560 --> 53:42.560\nThat's fair.\n\n53:42.560 --> 53:43.560\nI'm the bank.\n\n53:43.560 --> 53:44.560\nOkay.\n\n53:44.560 --> 53:45.560\nOkay.\n\n53:45.560 --> 53:46.560\nNow I want to be someone else.\n\n53:46.560 --> 53:47.560\nWell, no.\n\n53:47.560 --> 53:50.560\nCan I be, can I be Antonio Banderas?\n\n53:50.560 --> 53:51.560\nYeah.\n\n53:51.560 --> 53:52.560\nOkay.\n\n53:52.560 --> 53:57.720\nYou're actually the second person in a month to want that.\n\n53:57.720 --> 53:59.200\nThat seems like way too few.\n\n53:59.200 --> 54:00.520\nThat's amazing.\n\n54:00.520 --> 54:01.520\nHe rules.\n\n54:01.520 --> 54:02.520\nYeah.\n\n54:02.520 --> 54:08.920\nOmar Camacho just expressed a desire to be him a few weeks ago.\n\n54:08.920 --> 54:09.920\nAll right.\n\n54:09.920 --> 54:10.920\nWell, yeah.\n\n54:10.920 --> 54:15.600\nSo are we doing a scene and then it'll turn into like kind of a Hamilton-type musical\n\n54:15.600 --> 54:19.480\nabout financial, I think so, yeah, yeah.\n\n54:19.480 --> 54:20.480\nFinancial power.\n\n54:20.480 --> 54:21.480\nOkay.\n\n54:21.480 --> 54:22.480\nSure.\n\n54:22.480 --> 54:23.480\nSo I'll, I'll set the scene.\n\n54:23.480 --> 54:26.480\nYou haven't come in yet.\n\n54:26.480 --> 54:27.480\nGood.\n\n54:27.480 --> 54:28.480\nYou're rich.\n\n54:28.480 --> 54:29.480\nCome on.\n\n54:29.480 --> 54:30.480\nCome on.\n\n54:30.480 --> 54:33.800\nDave, you're, I think, by the way, I think that's my trainer that called out the usury\n\n54:33.800 --> 54:35.560\nthing and I think he's on your side.\n\n54:35.560 --> 54:36.560\nLook it up.\n\n54:36.560 --> 54:37.560\nLook up usury.\n\n54:37.560 --> 54:40.600\nI know when people yell things out, the primate instincts is like, shit, somebody wants to\n\n54:40.600 --> 54:42.720\nfucking kill me.\n\n54:42.720 --> 54:45.640\nWhat is he training you to do?\n\n54:45.640 --> 54:47.480\nCommit usury.\n\n54:47.480 --> 54:49.600\nIf you have to ask nothing.\n\n54:49.600 --> 54:50.600\nOkay.\n\n54:50.600 --> 54:53.080\nI thought it was some sort of emotional training.\n\n54:53.080 --> 54:56.480\nYou should have been like, holy shit, I was going to ask what happened.\n\n54:56.480 --> 54:57.960\nOh, you look great.\n\n54:57.960 --> 55:00.160\nZach, are you up there?\n\n55:00.160 --> 55:03.480\nAnd Zac McKeever up there in case we need beats for this Hamilton musical?\n\n55:03.480 --> 55:04.480\nAll right.\n\n55:04.480 --> 55:05.480\nHe says, sure.\n\n55:05.480 --> 55:06.480\nOkay.\n\n55:06.480 --> 55:11.480\nI mean, some of the first song would be like me setting up my bank because, you know.\n\n55:11.480 --> 55:12.480\nAll right.\n\n55:12.480 --> 55:15.600\nZach, Zach, I want you to DJ this Hamiltonian musical.\n\n55:15.600 --> 55:17.320\nWe want to like Glip Glop.\n\n55:17.320 --> 55:20.560\nWell, we want to accept him.\n\n55:20.560 --> 55:21.560\nRight.\n\n55:21.560 --> 55:22.560\nYeah.\n\n55:22.560 --> 55:23.560\nSorry.\n\n55:23.560 --> 55:24.560\nThat's what I mean.\n\n55:24.560 --> 55:25.560\nWell, maybe if Glip Glop changes from a private bank to a public bank, then we can accept\n\n55:25.560 --> 55:26.560\nthis Glip Glop.\n\n55:26.560 --> 55:27.560\nOh.\n\n55:27.560 --> 55:28.560\nRight.\n\n55:28.560 --> 55:30.240\nOh, he's a, he'll be a, okay, good.\n\n55:30.240 --> 55:31.240\nI like

don't be a customer then, I'll be a villain.\n\n55:42.400 --> 55:47.160\nWhy are you telling Antonio Banderas what to be in the scene?\n\n55:47.160 --> 55:49.000\nYou be an employee of the bank.\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:50.000\nOkay.\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:51.000\nAnd I'm bringing the, yeah.\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:52.000\nThis is your first day of work.\n\n55:52.000 -->

good as Book of Mormon.\n\n56:02.600 --> 56:03.600\nYeah.\n\n56:03.600 --> 56:05.600\nIt's going to make people vote for stuff too.\n\n56:05.600 --> 56:06.600\nYo.\n\n56:06.600 -->

comes through me.\n\n56:25.600 --> 56:26.600\nLike I was toast.\n\n56:26.600 --> 56:39.600\nThem brown on the edges and white in the middle, but everybody dances to this bank's fiddle.\n\n56:39.600 --> 56:40.600\nWelcome aboard.\n\n56:40.600 --> 56:41.600\nIt's your first day of work.\n\n56:41.600 --> 56:42.600\nBe a pro.\n\n56:42.600 --> 56:43.600\nDon't be a jerk.\n\n56:43.600 -->

customers.\n\n56:53.880 --> 56:55.600\nThat's a growing demographic.\n\n56:55.600 --> 56:57.600\nDisposable income.\n\n56:57.600 --> 57:02.600\nThey can get any job they want.\n\n57:02.600 --> 57:10.600\nWell, I'm Antonio Banderas and I'm here to say I'm at work for my very first day.\n\n57:10.600 --> 57:11.600\nHere's my accent.\n\n57:11.600 --> 57:12.600\nGood.\n\n57:12.600 --> 57:13.600\nHere's my accent.\n\n57:13.600 --> 57:14.600\nBad.\n\n57:14.600 --> 57:15.600\nIt's great.\n\n57:15.600 --> 57:16.600\nIt's good.\n\n57:16.600 --> 57:17.600\nThank you.\n\n57:17.600 --> 57:18.600\nThat's rad.\n\n57:18.600 --> 57:23.600\nBut you know it is not.\n\n57:23.600 --> 57:24.600\nThis bank.\n\n57:24.600 --> 57:26.600\nIt's all covered in snot.\n\n57:26.600 --> 57:27.600\nMorally.\n\n57:27.600 --> 57:28.600\nOh.\n\n57:28.600 --> 57:31.600\nI feel like it's set up horribly.\n\n57:31.600 --> 57:33.600\nWhat do you mean?\n\n57:33.600 --> 57:35.600\nDon't you like your job?\n\n57:35.600 --> 57:40.600\nWhy are you coming in here like a socialist stop, the bank works the way it works for the\n\n57:40.600 --> 57:41.600\ndollar?\n\n57:41.600 --> 57:54.600\nYo, if you don't like it, holler at your girl, your girl being Hillary, I don't know.\n\n57:54.600 --> 58:00.600\nThe thing about you that you do not understand is that you are a bank and I am a man.\n\n58:00.600 --> 58:08.600\nI see what lies before me just sorrow and I'm kind of horny, but for justice.\n\n58:08.600 --> 58:16.600\nAnd what I want is for you to give more of your profits to little kids so they can grow\n\n58:16.600 --> 58:21.600\nup in a world that's true and not sunk underneath the ocean blue.\n\n58:21.600 --> 58:33.600\nOkay.\n\n58:33.600 --> 58:39.600\nCertainly must say I've never spoken to a new employee with your brand of Spitfire.\n\n58:39.600 --> 58:46.600\nYou never before hired an employee with my brand of Spitfire.\n\n58:46.600 --> 58:48.600\nTing.\n\n58:48.600 --> 58:57.600\nIf we weren't making more money by through our Latin X outreach tax subsidy, then we\n\n58:57.600 --> 58:59.600\nwould by firing you.\n\n58:59.600 --> 59:01.600\nI don't have to tell you what I do.\n\n59:01.600 --> 59:09.600\nHowever, it just so happens I need a man like you in my office.\n\n59:09.600 --> 59:14.600\nLike permanently or just temporarily as we talk in a place that isn't right here on the\n\n59:14.600 --> 59:15.600\nbanking floor.\n\n59:15.600 --> 59:16.600\nTo speak to.\n\n59:16.600 --> 59:17.600\nYes.\n\n59:17.600 --> 59:22.600\nBecause there's things I need to read you into as they say.\n\n59:22.600 --> 59:27.600\nI will happily join you in your office, which I assume we are walking through now as I am\n\n59:27.600 --> 59:28.600\nsaying.\n\n59:28.600 --> 59:29.600\nYes.\n\n59:29.600 --> 59:30.600\nI like.\n\n59:30.600 --> 59:31.600\nI glide.\n\n59:31.600 --> 59:38.600\nBecause it's Broadway so the walls are going up on strings and the new walls are coming\n\n59:38.600 --> 59:39.600\ndown on strings.\n\n59:39.600 --> 59:42.600\nI'll learn the terminology.\n\n59:42.600 --> 59:47.600\nI think we could use a man like you at our upcoming conference.\n\n59:47.600 --> 59:55.600\nWe're sending a few candidates out to Florida for a global banking initiative.\n\n59:55.600 --> 59:57.600\nThat sounds wonderful.\n\n59:57.600 --> 59:58.600\nFlorida.\n\n59:58.600 --> 59:59.600\nI love Florida.\n\n59:59.600 --> 01:00:08.600\nI love tan middle-aged white women and Jell-O shots.\n\n01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:15.600\nJust keep representing us the way we like to be represented so we don't lose our subsidy.\n\n01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.600\nYou'll keep your job.\n\n01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.600\nThere may be a promotion for you.\n\n01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.600\nBut do me a favor.\n\n01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:25.600\nPut a clamp on all this commie talk you were spewing when you came in.\n\n01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:32.600\nBut what if I told you that in doing some of these commie things, we, this bank here,\n\n01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:37.600\ncould keep more money instead of putting it away into other places?\n\n01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:42.600\nOh, keeping more money is called profit and I'm sure we figured out how to turn one of\n\n01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.600\nthose by now.\n\n01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.600\nYou would think so.\n\n01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:53.600\nWill he ever understand?\n\n01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.600\nBeat.\n\n01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:07.600\nWell, I'm the Tony of Enderis and I'm here to say, there's still a Tony of Enderis in\n\n01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.600\nevery way.\n\n01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.600\nJust have to remind you that up front.\n\n01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.600\nHere's the thing.\n\n01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.600\nI'm gone.\n\n01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.600\nYou're doing, I thought you were doing like a solo.\n\n01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.600\nYes.\n\n01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.600\nOf course.\n\n01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.600\nThis is all in my head.\n\n01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.600\nThis is you explaining to the audience how you feel so that they're on your side.\n\n01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.600\nSo don't hog my moment in the spotlight.\n\n01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:28.600\nIt feels so right right here between you and me.\n\n01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.600\nJust me.\n\n01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.600\nJust him.\n\n01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.600\nJust me.\n\n01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.600\nJust him.\n\n01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:40.600\nBetween you and me and just me, there should be life and liberty and not banks that just\n\n01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.600\ncreate poverty.\n\n01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.600\nBut that's just between you and me.\n\n01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.600\nJust him.\n\n01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.600\nMe.\n\n01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.600\nAnd him.\n\n01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.600\nBoy, oh boy, I didn't think I would rap.\n\n01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:55.600\nHonestly, I'm surprised it's not crap.\n\n01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.600\nHere's the thing that I want you to hear.\n\n01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.600\nVote for measure B or I'll cut off my ear.\n\n01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.600\nOh, shit.\n\n01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.600\nOh no, my hearing's going.\n\n01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:15.600\nIt's the sound of an airplane landing in Florida.\n\n01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.600\nOh, yes.\n\n01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.600\nWe're crossing a threshold.\n\n01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.600\nCut the music.\n\n01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.600\nOh, no.\n\n01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:26.600\nYou're in Florida, but your ears hurt.\n\n01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:31.600\nFlorida, moderately priced beverages everywhere.\n\n01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.600\nFast casual dining.\n\n01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.600\nExcuse me, please get out of my way.\n\n01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.600\nI can't.\n\n01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.600\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:43.600\nLet me help you pick up these files for the banking conference.\n\n01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.600\nOh, I'm sure to be late now and get fired.\n\n01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.600\nWait a minute.\n\n01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.600\nI'm worried about being fired for other reasons at this very\n\n01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.600\nbanking conference.\n\n01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.600\nMaybe you and I are very alike.\n\n01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.600\nWell, since we're both obviously going to take different cabs,\n\n01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.600\nwe're both going to be late.\n\n01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.600\nWait, wait.\n\n01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.600\nBut what if we took one cab together?\n\n01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.600\nThis one right here.\n\n01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.600\nWow, what a Deus Ex Machina.\n\n01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:15.600\nHello, hello, did you guys want to get into my taxi cab?\n\n01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.600\nFor some reason I am a Frenchman.\n\n01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.600\nHe doesn't seem sure about his accent either.\n\n01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.600\nI trust him.\n\n01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.600\nHas anyone told you, sir, that you sound a little bit like Ren from\n\n01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.600\nRen and Stimpy?\n\n01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.600\nYes, every day of my life.\n\n01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:40.600\nWell, I have no choice but to share this cab, but it runs counter\n\n01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.600\nto everything my parents taught me about how to use...\n\n01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.600\nMadam, you have every choice.\n\n01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:47.600\nYou do not have to get into any cab that you don't want to get into.\n\n01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.600\nJust wait.\n\n01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.600\nLook at me now and understand that, yes, if we competed individually,\n\n01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:56.600\nmaybe you would get a cab faster than hearing me give this emotional\n\n01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.600\nspeech.\n\n01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:04.600\nBut if we work together and share the cab, like two people who share\n\n01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:09.600\nmaybe a planet and that planet's resources, maybe we'd get there on time\n\n01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:16.600\nand not get fired but prosper.\n\n01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:20.600\nI'll do it right now and think about it later.\n\n01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.600\nThat's great, person whose name I don't know yet.\n\n01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.600\nIt's Wendy.\n\n01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.600\nWendy.\n\n01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.600\nWait, did you say Wendy or Wendy?\n\n01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.600\nWendy.\n\n01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.600\nOkay, sorry.\n\n01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.600\nGo back into your thing.\n\n01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.600\nI'm sorry I interrupted.\n\n01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.600\nMy name is Wendy.\n\n01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:48.600\nHear me blow forever.\n\n01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:55.600\nI often know what others know.\n\n01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:00.600\nIt's the winds of change.\n\n01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.600\nFor me, it's the winds of fear.\n\n01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.600\nBlow those winds away.\n\n01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.600\nOh, they're going, they're going away now.\n\n01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:16.600\nIf only I had your confidence and your wisdom, Antonio.\n\n01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:22.600\nIf only I could think twice before I speak.\n\n01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:28.600\nIf only I had your long black locks and piercing eyes.\n\n01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:33.600\nIf only I had your body and yours mine to keep.\n\n01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:39.600\nWhy don't we share them?\n\n01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:49.600\nIn a collective of body parts and qualities.\n\n01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.600\nSo we can both draw upon them wind.\n\n01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.600\nOh, is that a cab?\n\n01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.600\nAre you open?\n\n01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600\nHey.\n\n01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.600\nNo, that's ours, sir.\n\n01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:59.600\nThank you.\n\n01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.600\nLet's get it.\n\n01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.600\nLet's get it in.\n\n01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.600\nCome on.\n\n01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.600\nLet's get in the cab.\n\n01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.600\nOh.\n\n01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.600\nOh.\n\n01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.600\nOh.\n\n01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:10.600\nI'm taking you to the economic conference, I understand, right?\n\n01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.600\nYes, this is the Holiday Inn.\n\n01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.600\nYes, please.\n\n01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.600\nWe're going to be big people in the banking world one day.\n\n01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.600\nAll right, well, actually, it was next door to the airport.\n\n01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.600\nYou didn't even have to get into my cab.\n\n01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.600\nDidn't we, though?\n\n01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.600\nYou know what?\n\n01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:32.600\nI don't even want to accept any money from you because it feels like the love that you have provided the world is enough to sustain a whole community.\n\n01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.600\nOh, gosh.\n\n01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.600\nWhat is it about you?\n\n01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:41.600\nEver since I met you, it's like goods are being exchanged for services with no standardized currency.\n\n01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:46.600\nPeople tell me that all the time.\n\n01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.600\nHey, Wendy.\n\n01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.600\nAntonio.\n\n01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:59.600\nWhy don't we, if you mind, if you are enthusiastically consenting, hold my hand.\n\n01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.600\nI know we did it already, but I'm asking again to prove that I am a gentleman.\n\n01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.600\nOkay.\n\n01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:12.600\nAnd why don't we walk together into a new world of sharing, banking, and our hearts?\n\n01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.600\nWell, we've got to go to the conference, right?\n\n01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:20.600\nYeah, I meant metaphorically, but literally, yes, I mean, let's walk directly into that Holiday Inn Express.\n\n01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.600\nIf you're asking, can we sit together at the seminar?\n\n01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.600\nOf course.\n\n01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.600\nOh, cool.\n\n01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:29.600\nI guess I have some abandonment issues, so I didn't really read that, right?\n\n01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.600\nScreech!\n\n01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.600\nHello, this is me again, the cab driver. Oh, I overheard you saying you want to go into the seminar?\n\n01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.600\nYes.\n\n01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.600\nYou have to go all the way around the back of the convention center.\n\n01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.600\nHop back into the cab and I'll take you there right now.\n\n01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.600\nOkay.\n\n01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:43.600\nIt'll be on the house.\n\n01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.600\nIt'll be mutual reciprocity.\n\n01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:51.600\nIt is not based on capitalism or any sort of agreed upon finance.\n\n01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:57.600\nIt's just the fact that you have made me smile and I will give you a free ride around the back of the seminar.\n\n01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:00.600\nThank you so much for explaining that to us.\n\n01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:01.600\nYeah.\n\n01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:02.600\nLet's do it.\n\n01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:05.600\nI just want to be totally on to the table about this.\n\n01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:06.600\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:07.600\nAll right.\n\n01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:08.600\nLet's go back into Zika.\n\n01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.600\nAntonio, I had abandonment issues once too.\n\n01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:11.600\nReally?\n\n01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.600\nCan I give you some advice?\n\n01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.600\nSure.\n\n01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.600\nAbandon them.\n\n01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:23.600\nAbandon those issues of abandonment.\n\n01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.600\nI'm going to leave them behind.\n\n01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.600\nI promise you.\n\n01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:35.600\nLet them be afraid to be left alone.\n\n01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:41.600\nI will do that.\n\n01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:42.600\nWow.\n\n01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:49.600\nBeing here right now in the place where we first met outside of this cab makes me know that I'm going to spend the rest of my life with you.\n\n01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:53.600\nWill you share your life with me?\n\n01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.600\nOh.\n\n01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.600\nI'm afraid to abandon him.\n\n01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.600\nBut I'm also afraid to be abandoned.\n\n01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.600\nBut I'm not afraid to abandon those fears.\n\n01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.600\nI do.\n\n01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.600\nYes.\n\n01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.600\nShe said yes.\n\n01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.600\nOh, no.\n\n01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.600\nLet's skip the whole banking conference.\n\n01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.600\nThere's nothing they can teach us.\n\n01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:19.600\nLet's open our own bank based on Cyclon B.\n\n01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:20.600\nWhat's the thing called?\n\n01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.600\nCyclon B.\n\n01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.600\nOh, boy.\n\n01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.600\nNo, it's a very common misunderstanding.\n\n01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.600\nAs the cab driver, I overheard that.\n\n01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.600\nIt is certainly not Cyclon B.\n\n01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.600\nWell, yes, on Cyclon B.\n\n01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.600\nThat's a gas that was used in concentration camps.\n\n01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.600\nYes.\n\n01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:40.600\nI don't know why out of all the B things with that coming to my...\n\n01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.600\nBecause you're feeling so many things right now.\n\n01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:43.600\nWe're getting married.\n\n01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.600\nIt's because I'm from Wyoming.\n\n01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.600\nYes, of course.\n\n01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:51.600\nYou get targeted Facebook ads that say only people who are from Wyoming make up bad things just like MB would like this.\n\n01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.600\nMen that look like you were going to kill me.\n\n01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.600\nOh, yes.\n\n01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.600\nNo, that's your fear.\n\n01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:00.600\nAnd you're going to abandon that fear.\n\n01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.600\nLeave it behind.\n\n01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:07.600\nAnd come evermore near.\n\n01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:14.600\nWe're going to get married.\n\n01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:20.600\nAnd form a form.\n\n01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:35.600\nForm a good part in being.\n\n01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.600\nGood show, man.\n\n01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.600\nGood show.\n\n01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.600\nHey, great show, man.\n\n01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:45.600\nOh, no.\n\n01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.600\nSuper great.\n\n01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.600\nOh, great show, man.\n\n01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.600\nOkay, fine.\n\n01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.600\nOne more time for Michael Flatley, everybody.\n\n01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:58.600\nMichael Flatley.\n\n01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:01.600\nSo that's what a public bank is.\n\n01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.600\nI mean, nothing bad happened to them.\n\n01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.600\nThey just met and fell in love.\n\n01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:10.600\nYes, some stories are small.\n\n01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.600\nAll right.\n\n01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.600\nBut if you guys got into my cab, I was going to abduct you both.\n\n01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.600\nThat's what it was seeming like.\n\n01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.600\nIt was a trick.\n\n01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.600\nI could feel that tension.\n\n01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:23.600\nI was going to find out that you were a trader to the bank.\n\n01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:28.600\nHe's a double agent working for the thing.\n\n01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:33.600\nWell, Jeff spends a lot of the time that he should be here doing this show out on the\n\n01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.600\nroad with professional improvisers.\n\n01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:39.600\nSo he knew where he was going and we didn't.\n\n01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.600\nNo, but you guys are falling in love and singing and there's no way.\n\n01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.600\nI thought they would laugh at that.\n\n01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.600\nI didn't know what people would be like, ooh, burn.\n\n01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.600\nIt was a joke.\n\n01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.600\nI thought it would be funny.\n\n01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.600\nOh, improv slam.\n\n01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.600\nI'm not upset.\n\n01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.600\nI thought it would be a funny joke.\n\n01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.600\nBut I think maybe some of the people are resentful of you for being so absent lately.\n\n01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.600\nYeah.\n\n01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.600\nOr maybe they're racist.\n\n01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.600\nThey hate Brandon.\n\n01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.600\nI don't know.\n\n01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.600\nYeah.\n\n01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.600\nOnly your vote will decide.\n\n01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.600\nThe B is for Brandon.\n\n01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:15.600\nSometimes.\n\n01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.600\nOh, shit.\n\n01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.600\nThat's measure B.\n\n01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.600\nYeah.\n\n01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.600\nMeasure B is Brandon.\n\n01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.600\nI thought it was Ben Derris.\n\n01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.600\nI also thought.\n\n01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.600\nOh, that should have come up.\n\n01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.600\nYou are good at improv.\n\n01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.600\nYeah.\n\n01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:35.600\nMeasure B is, okay, now forgive my ignorance.\n\n01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.600\nSo do you know what a public bank is yet?\n\n01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.600\nLet's start there.\n\n01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:45.600\nBut is measure B, is it a, it's not a legal referendum.\n\n01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.600\nIt's not something that's up for vote.\n\n01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.600\nIt is.\n\n01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.600\nYeah.\n\n01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.600\nYeah.\n\n01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.600\nSo it's a very small change to the city's charter that makes it legal to create a public bank.\n\n01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.600\nIt is currently illegal to make a public bank.\n\n01:12:58.600 --> 01:12:59.600\nRight.\n\n01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.600\nAnd the change would make it legal.\n\n01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:02.600\nOh, so simple, right?\n\n01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:03.600\nYeah, basically.\n\n01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.600\nVery simple.\n\n01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.600\nToo simple, in fact.\n\n01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:10.600\nIt's like when we, it's like, it's like saying, hey, porn stars don't have to wear condoms.\n\n01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.600\nSorry, bad example.\n\n01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.600\nI mean, they don't.\n\n01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.600\nBut it is true.\n\n01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:18.200\nWhen we had our friend Riley Reed up here, even though that's, it's easy to cloak something\n\n01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.600\nin the guise of like, we're just trying to keep people safe.\n\n01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:21.600\nNo.\n\n01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.600\nBut you can also be like, it's like, oh fuck, you know, oppression and stuff.\n\n01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:28.600\nIt's like, it's not like porn stars are saying like, we want to be unsafe.\n\n01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:29.600\nRight.\n\n01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:30.600\nIt's more like, keep this, yeah.\n\n01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.600\nIf everyone has socialized medicine, you check all the time, parallel for me to drop.\n\n01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:36.600\nThis is really stupid.\n\n01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.600\nI think it was the same measure, though.\n\n01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.600\nWell, I think it was.\n\n01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.600\nI literally think it was the same.\n\n01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.600\nYeah, measure B, the conom long.\n\n01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.600\nI think it was the same letter.\n\n01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.600\nIt was pushed by the guy who's pushing Proposition 10.\n\n01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.600\nYeah, really wild.\n\n01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.600\nBecause Prop 10 is great.\n\n01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.600\nAnd that dude fucking sucked.\n\n01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.600\nYeah.\n\n01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.600\nBut he saw the light.\n\n01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:56.600\nThere were a bunch of activists that basically were like, yo, Prop 10 is good because rent\n\n01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:01.600\ncontrol is tight and people shouldn't landlord shouldn't be able to jack up prices.\n\n01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:06.600\nWhen people move out, like they shouldn't be able to do vacancy bullshit and like jack\n\n01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.600\nup the rent.\n\n01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.600\nHowever much they want and keep people out of the neighborhood.\n\n01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.600\nIs there a lot of.\n\n01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.600\nSo yes, on 10 also.\n\n01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:13.600\nYeah.\n\n01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:14.600\nYeah.\n\n01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:15.600\n10 rules is there.\n\n01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.600\nSorry.\n\n01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.600\nI didn't even I was thinking about my next thing that I wanted to ask.\n\n01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.600\nThat's good.\n\n01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.600\nBut that's fine.\n\n01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:21.600\nI'm sure measured.\n\n01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:26.100\nBut is there what I wanted to ask is because we're like, if you even go to a bar and you\n\n01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:31.960\naren't on Twitter like me, like I'm still I'm like right now being flooded with imagery\n\n01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:35.600\nthat's like proposition this and then referendum that and all this stuff.\n\n01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:40.720\nAnd it's like, and we already know like if we're if we're remotely savvy enough to get\n\n01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:44.440\njaded about it that that you've never you have no idea what the truth is now at this\n\n01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:50.840\npoint is just like what I want to ask you about measure B is for the for the folks that\n\n01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:53.440\nare listening like that are in Los Angeles.\n\n01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:58.160\nWhat can they expect to see on TV or hear from their friends who have saw something that\n\n01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:03.280\nsomeone else on TV that's like the most common like reflexes like nut kick.\n\n01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.680\nLike well, I heard that's for just people that want to have elephants eat their dick.\n\n01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:11.200\nWell, I heard we don't even know what's going to happen if we vote yes on measure B. We\n\n01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:15.920\nmight be unleashing the gates to the apocalypse because we don't know on paper what it is.\n\n01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:16.920\nShut up dude.\n\n01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:17.920\nDon't tell him.\n\n01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:18.920\nYeah.\n\n01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:20.360\nNo, that is the opposition.\n\n01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:23.800\nWhat's the biggest opposition is we don't know what could happen.\n\n01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:24.800\nMaybe demons.\n\n01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:25.800\nRight.\n\n01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:26.800\nPretty much.\n\n01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.800\nThere's that.\n\n01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.600\nI'm just glad we chose this opportunity to talk about this on a podcast that will air\n\n01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:32.600\ntwo days after.\n\n01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:33.600\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:34.600\nRight.\n\n01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:35.600\nYou're right.\n\n01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:36.600\nYou're right.\n\n01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.200\nWell, we're talking to well, that's a bunch of fired up people here.\n\n01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.800\nIt makes it makes more at least 5000 people here tonight at the dime a tap link letter\n\n01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:45.040\nthat will certainly go out and vote tomorrow.\n\n01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.040\nYou're too.\n\n01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.040\nYou're fair enough.\n\n01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.040\nJeff.\n\n01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:54.680\nI called you to I called you to because I started, I aborted to to say, okay, it was\n\n01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:55.680\na shitty tissue.\n\n01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:00.000\nVery, very, however, it actually kind of makes sense because we're talking to the 38 people\n\n01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.400\nin Los Angeles that come actually to see the show.\n\n01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400\nI love it.\n\n01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.400\nThere's more than 38.\n\n01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400\nThank you.\n\n01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.400\nFour more.\n\n01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.400\nYeah.\n\n01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:12.160\nFour more audience members, four more audience members.\n\n01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.240\nDon't chant that.\n\n01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.960\nSo here's the thing, the other thing is people are like, Oh, what, the city's going to run\n\n01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.960\na bank.\n\n01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:27.320\nHow can they run a bank because they can't and to that, I've always said that.\n\n01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.840\nThat's basically literally the guy in the ballot.\n\n01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:35.000\nIf you read the ballot, the argument against measure B for the guy who is he he looks exactly\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000\nlike you think he would.\n\n01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.360\nHis name is Jack Humphreyville and he has no neck at all whatsoever.\n\n01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:44.200\nJack Humphreyville and he literally in the ballot in the argument against measure B\n\n01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:48.520\nhe goes, It's baloney.\n\n01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.840\nAnd there was there's a thing that ran on KCRW today that interviewed a bunch of us\n\n01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:57.520\norganizers for B and him and he's like, It seems like they're getting stoned.\n\n01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.880\nLike those are that's really what it is.\n\n01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:05.840\nHe won't stand the baloney, you know, the only slippery slope I could think of I would\n\n01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:10.760\nhave to go into like shadow run logic or be like, Are you saying that in the year 2040\n\n01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:15.520\nLos Angeles could be a corporation turning more profit than San Diego and go to war\n\n01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.520\nwith them?\n\n01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:21.000\nNo, but seriously, so we want to discuss you should discuss that because people are worried\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000\nabout that.\n\n01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.320\nThere is a fear people have, but the reality is a fear I would love to have.\n\n01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.320\nRight.\n\n01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:29.920\nI would love the opportunity Los Angeles is a trillionaire, right?\n\n01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:33.880\nAnd I think it would be better if do you guys have a real vision for what it's going to\n\n01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:38.320\nlook like because a lot of the push has been, Oh, we don't have any strong, it's only we're\n\n01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.800\nmaking it legal to talk about now, so then going forward, if it passes, we'll be able\n\n01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:47.000\nto in city councils discuss what we want the shape of this to be and actually legislate\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000\nit into existence.\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nSo we're already doing that.\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000\nRight.\n\n01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.040\nSo what, what, what, how is that process going to work?\n\n01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.960\nAnd how is it going to prevent us from like just being taken over or whatever, who's going\n\n01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:56.960\nto govern it?\n\n01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:57.960\nWhat?\n\n01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:02.000\nSo the important thing right is first and foremost, right now, the people in charge of\n\n01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.040\nthe banks, you have zero means of democracy there, right?\n\n01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:10.920\nCollabs, Lloyd Blank, right now, right now, right now, the city just has to get in line\n\n01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.680\nwith you at Bank of America and open an account.\n\n01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:14.680\nYes, exactly.\n\n01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.680\nAnd it's like, yeah.\n\n01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:18.720\nDo I get the checks or what?\n\n01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:19.720\nYeah.\n\n01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:20.720\nShout out.\n\n01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:21.880\nAnd get his personalized checks.\n\n01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:22.880\nI had them.\n\n01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:23.880\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:24.880\nThe babies are so cute.\n\n01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.520\nThey're flower pots.\n\n01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:34.520\nSo what would happen is there would be a very strict charter that we so city council is\n\n01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:37.240\nletting us organizers have a seat at the table.\n\n01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:40.680\nWe are also working on state legislation that we need to be passed in order to make this\n\n01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:41.680\na possibility.\n\n01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.040\nSo in doing that, because statewide it's also illegal, right?\n\n01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.040\nYes.\n\n01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.040\nRight.\n\n01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:51.040\nBut other cities have already made, because of their charters, they're able to do what\n\n01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:54.000\nMeasure B would do for our like Oakland and San Francisco specifically.\n\n01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nThey're already working on it.\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000\nThey're already working on it.\n\n01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.200\nThey've, they've like, they're like, okay, we've got task force and it's not shitty bankers.\n\n01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:03.800\nThey're like letting the organizers lead the way because everybody's like, oh, this saves\n\n01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.800\nus billions of dollars and we get to fill in potholes.\n\n01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.560\nSo it's kind of okay that we're talking about it on our podcast.\n\n01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.480\nWell, I hope so.\n\n01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.720\nBecause it's like medical marijuana a couple of years ago.\n\n01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:18.600\nIt's like an issue that's, you know, maybe the referendums will be different numbers\n\n01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:19.600\nand things.\n\n01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:20.600\nYes.\n\n01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:21.600\nIt's going to start.\n\n01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.600\nThis is like a harbinger.\n\n01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.600\nHopefully this can be a domino effect.\n\n01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.920\nSo what happens next is there's the, it's just a slick harbinger.\n\n01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:35.640\nSo what happens next is the, the, the charter has to be very strict and it has to say we\n\n01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:41.080\nwill not invest in oil pipelines or private prisons or fucking baby cages or any of that\n\n01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.080\nshit.\n\n01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:46.520\nI can't, it might say I literally can't believe I have to write baby cages, but here we are\n\n01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.520\nbaby cages.\n\n01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.520\nNo to that.\n\n01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:51.720\nI never thought I'd have to not check this box.\n\n01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:52.720\nRight.\n\n01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.920\nNever thought this box would have to be an option, but here we are.\n\n01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:59.000\nAnd so, and then also prioritize, right?\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:06.840\nLike if we're going to not all die in 40 years, like the UN's report just said might happen.\n\n01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:12.040\nThey've been saying that for eight years.\n\n01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:21.280\nFirst it was 48 years, then it was 47, seven years later, no, it's 40 years, the world's\n\n01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:28.240\ngoing to end, but maybe if you do something at 20 you could maybe blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:36.120\nI went jogging the other day, it was warm or I'm sorry, cold.\n\n01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.620\nWeather changes people.\n\n01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:40.120\nAll right, sorry.\n\n01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:48.040\nSo again, there's something about pajamas that has made you, no, it's alcoholism.\n\n01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.040\nI'm so drunk.\n\n01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.040\nOkay.\n\n01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:55.320\nBut you're wearing your alcoholism like micro-model fiber, right?\n\n01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:58.680\nI hope that myundies could see this at a compatible marketing point.\n\n01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.560\nIt's three times softer than normal alcohol.\n\n01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:04.600\nCan we take a moment, can we get a momentary nipple update where your nipple's at?\n\n01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:05.600\nIt's fine actually.\n\n01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:06.600\nNipple experiment.\n\n01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:07.600\nThat's a good advertiser too.\n\n01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.080\nHey, are you a nipple guy?\n\n01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.080\nDon't worry about it.\n\n01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:15.880\nDo you get horny when soft things touch your nipples?\n\n01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:21.160\nAre you therefore worried about wearing a Myundie onesie?\n\n01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.080\nI'm Dan Harmon.\n\n01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.920\nI've been sitting up here.\n\n01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:31.880\nWearing draped in fabric and I've been talking about banking for an hour.\n\n01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:34.000\nI ain't got no hard on.\n\n01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.200\nMyundies, I ain't got no hard on.\n\n01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.080\nI'm going to sleep like a baby.\n\n01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:44.520\nBaby ain't got no hard on.\n\n01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:47.800\nMaybe we'll go back to the drawing board on the baby one.\n\n01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:52.160\nBut anyway, if we're going to mobilize enough capital to not all die in 40 years, we're\n\n01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:57.720\ngoing to need to do it by a lot of money in the billions and a public bank after five\n\n01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:59.920\nyears and we'll be able to renew.\n\n01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:03.520\nWe're talking renewable energy for whole neighborhoods, solar panels, batteries, all\n\n01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:07.880\nthat shit because we're taking billions that we're going to bad stuff and putting it to\n\n01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:08.880\ngood stuff.\n\n01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:12.040\nMorally, it's pretty black and white.\n\n01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:19.320\nI remember Sarah Silverman talking about this years ago and this is sort of a cousin\n\n01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:22.320\nof divestment.\n\n01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.320\nThat's what she was talking about.\n\n01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:28.040\nWe're going to get it out of your nationally franchised banks and put it into credit unions,\n\n01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:32.320\nwhich I have not done yet and I should do.\n\n01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.520\nYou should because I've scared my accountant a little at me.\n\n01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.440\nYou got to be afraid of an accountant your whole life.\n\n01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:42.760\nThe idea there is that, hey, if your bank, God bless their soul, they don't have to be\n\n01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:47.840\nevil to be following the marching orders of, we're supposed to make more money than the\n\n01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:51.200\nbank across the street, which is also an international bank.\n\n01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:56.800\nSo of course, your funds are going to tend to end up aerosol misted across the planet.\n\n01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:01.520\nJosh has invested all of his $500,000 winnings from the casino into mattress.\n\n01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.520\nWait.\n\n01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.520\nAt his house.\n\n01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:07.520\nI'm Casper, Dave, the friendly boy.\n\n01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.520\nOh, I'm Casper.\n\n01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.520\nSorry, Casper.\n\n01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.520\nThat's me.\n\n01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:11.520\nI'm the mattress guy.\n\n01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:17.760\nI put all of my Rick and Morty merchandising money in one blue apron.\n\n01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:21.800\nThe bluest apron of all because there's no better investment than a meal delivered to\n\n01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:27.640\nyour home in pieces that you then assemble.\n\n01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:33.760\nHave the satisfaction of an adult while remaining a child.\n\n01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:41.600\nIt's like curry and barbecue, but for other genres of food, it's, it's, it's the same\n\n01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:47.120\nlifestyle you're used to, but we have your credit card number, but you do have to work\n\n01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.120\ntoo.\n\n01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.760\nFrom a distance, you'll look like a grownup.\n\n01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.800\nOh, you don't have time to pick and choose your own fucking things, baby.\n\n01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:01.800\nTake the box, please.\n\n01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:07.920\nThink of it as adulting wheels.\n\n01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:13.000\nDon't have time to check the cabbage.\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.360\nDon't have time to know whether you should buy cabbage.\n\n01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.360\nWe will give you a box.\n\n01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:20.600\nHoney, did you check cabbage today?\n\n01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:24.640\nThere will be a bag of cabbage in it that will say, pour me into a skillet.\n\n01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:29.280\nWhat about a new service that picks you up like a Lyft or an Uber or a Post-Mate or a\n\n01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:33.480\nGrubhub or whatever, and they, there's just an adult-sized shopping cart that you get\n\n01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:35.480\nto sit in like a baby.\n\n01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.880\nOh my God, that would be amazing.\n\n01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:41.400\nAnd you get to, you get to go through a farmer's market and learn how to like buy.\n\n01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:42.960\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\n01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:49.480\nThat's the, it's a, it's a, it's a, now this guy's talking about fucking like, God damn\n\n01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.480\nit.\n\n01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:51.480\nYou could do a cheaper one.\n\n01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:57.640\nA giant Lily Tomlin shopping cart where you get to remember, you put your, you sit facing\n\n01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:04.000\na fucking dude who's like, or, or, or whatever, a parental figure who's like, well, what do\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000\nyou like?\n\n01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.400\nAnd you're like encouraged, you're encouraged to be like, they tell you like, they're like,\n\n01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:14.920\ndo not, you are not here to please this person.\n\n01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:21.120\nLike you're, we want you to cry, throw a tantrum, like, like test us, test us.\n\n01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:24.640\nAnd it's like, they're starting, they just wheel you around and they go like, do you\n\n01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:28.520\nlike lucky charms or no.\n\n01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:32.200\nAnd you just get to like fucking, can you, I have so much rage and shame in me right now\n\n01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:34.440\nthat would be exercised by that.\n\n01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:39.160\nI'm not, I know it sounds like a big fucking joke, but I'm so, and I know it's not really\n\n01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:48.040\nviable as a financial institution, but I would pay so much if they said, like, have you ever,\n\n01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:54.600\nhave you ever gone groucher, groucher dolting or what about, wait, what about like the Uber\n\n01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:55.600\npool version of that?\n\n01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.520\nWould it be like a double wide so everybody gets to kick their legs out?\n\n01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:02.440\nYeah, you do it with friends and you get to like pedal the cart, like one of those beer.\n\n01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:06.440\nIf you pay less, they have to be just in the car and they get like carrots put on them\n\n01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:07.440\nor whatever.\n\n01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:12.600\nOh, how amazing would it be if the person was a giant robot?\n\n01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:15.800\nThat was just like mom legs from like Muppet Baby or whatever.\n\n01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:21.400\nAnd you could like throw food at it and go like, fuck you, bitch, fuck you.\n\n01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:27.240\nI don't want to go to school tomorrow, but Daniel, you're sitting on just this wire mesh\n\n01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:34.080\nbench with their best friends who like group onto this experience and you pedal and you\n\n01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.080\ngo like, let's go.\n\n01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.080\nSo what do you guys want to do?\n\n01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:40.640\nAnd you just go, let's go to the beer aisle and it's like, give us beer and the robots\n\n01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:45.880\nprogram to go like, you're not old enough, blue, blue, blue, blue.\n\n01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:49.800\nAnd you're just like, fuck you, you piece of shit.\n\n01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:52.680\nAre you sure you meant to talk to your mother like that?\n\n01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:55.680\nDan Harmon.\n\n01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:59.680\nDan Harmon party.\n\n01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:02.480\nDan Harmon party guest one.\n\n01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.160\nDan Harmon party.\n\n01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.800\nWere any of you asked to be born?\n\n01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:07.800\nNo!\n\n01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:09.720\nWe weren't asked to be born.\n\n01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:12.240\nI'm so happy my dumb idea got this much traction.\n\n01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.240\nThat's so good.\n\n01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.240\nI'm tired.\n\n01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:17.240\nI mean, that's, that is like, like, like fucking to sit.\n\n01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:21.000\nI like, like, I think we all had a visceral memory except maybe a couple of people that\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:29.440\nare like, most be nice and I don't, I don't want to hear their story, but, but, but, but,\n\n01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.800\nbut, but like that, that, like, that feel, I just, I forgot, you know, because it's not\n\n01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:37.080\nsomething that celebrated it, but it's like, holy shit, like putting your little tushy\n\n01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:42.320\nin a fucking shop and wheeling your crabby little ass around and asking what you like\n\n01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:43.320\nand don't like.\n\n01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:46.120\nIt's not like you got anything that you wanted, right?\n\n01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:49.680\nLike, like, like, it's, but it's actually the agency is what's delicious.\n\n01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:54.440\nSo it's like, you're just being able to go like, I want bananas.\n\n01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:55.440\nYou want, we got bananas.\n\n01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.720\nI'm like, those are green.\n\n01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:03.840\nThey turn yellow eventually says you, you know, just the right to be a little prick.\n\n01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:08.000\nI don't mean to like burst the bubble, but I feel like with like the right amount of\n\n01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.360\nmushrooms, you could do this from your very home.\n\n01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:17.400\nSo virtual reality, right, that, that's could be a huge, it's sort of like, like, remember\n\n01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:22.280\nin the seventies, I remember references like primal scream therapy, you know, like, like,\n\n01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:26.800\nlike, make fun of everything, but it's like, I'm telling you, man, I've been through some\n\n01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.800\nshit this year.\n\n01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:32.120\nI, I, I'm aware of the fact that I have not been through nearly as much shit as almost\n\n01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:34.240\nanyone listening.\n\n01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:39.280\nThat is not how I, how I measure shit is by your measurement.\n\n01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:44.360\nBut my point is like, I've been through some shit this year that most notably I, I, I can't\n\n01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:45.360\ntalk about.\n\n01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:49.760\nAnd it, and it builds this fucking, my therapist has told me so many weeks in a row.\n\n01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.160\nShe's like, you're going to go get a drink.\n\n01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.960\nAre you going to get, are you going to medicate this?\n\n01:28:53.960 --> 01:29:00.760\nAnd I'm like, probably like, bet no, ain't no one invented nothing better.\n\n01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:03.240\nLike, like, like, like, she did.\n\n01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:04.720\nIt's called weed, dog.\n\n01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.840\nWell, wait, no, I don't, no, dude, we, I don't know, I mean, I don't want, I don't want to\n\n01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:13.120\njust from the hip, like negate that because sometimes it says no cops on it.\n\n01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:17.640\nThat's more of a crapshoot for me where it's like, I hit the wrong weed at the wrong time\n\n01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:18.640\nand the wrong amount.\n\n01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:20.280\nAnd then all of a sudden I'm like, what are you doing?\n\n01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.240\nYou're, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:27.960\nBut booze is as old as a fucking cowboy, biting a belt, like you suck a snake venom out of\n\n01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.760\nhis titty.\n\n01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:31.680\nAnd then he gives you a free gun.\n\n01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:36.080\nIt's just fucking brute force that was by four across the head, fucking, you're drunk\n\n01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.080\nnow.\n\n01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:41.800\nAnd the trouble being that you, as my therapist says, she's like, it's a preservative, like\n\n01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:42.800\nwhat do we do with shit?\n\n01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:45.200\nAnd it's like, sometimes she's a little clever about this stuff.\n\n01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:49.080\nBut I think it's like, it's like, yeah, it does, it preserves it.\n\n01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:50.800\nLike I have no place to put my rage.\n\n01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:55.120\nI'm like, I'm like punching shit, I got bloody knuckles, like, I'm like, I'm like, every\n\n01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.360\nonce in a while I'm erupting into this rage.\n\n01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:03.880\nAnd I think that it's like, sooner or later I'm going to put it somewhere and it could\n\n01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:07.720\nbe a place that hurts me or, or, or another person.\n\n01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:13.280\nAnd I feel like actually, like we must all feel that constantly, where it's like, well,\n\n01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:19.160\nhow, how, when do I get to shit my pants and I just think it's a wonderful like, like,\n\n01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:23.760\nlike, actually maybe that's what virtual reality could be is like, you throw these tantrums,\n\n01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:28.840\nyou just go like, I'm a baby, I want to, that's what this podcast was for me up until this\n\n01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.440\nlast year.\n\n01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:31.960\nThis is where I came to sit.\n\n01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:35.440\nThis is ask these guys, they'll tell you, they've been pushing me in a shopping cart\n\n01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:43.000\nand I've been, I've been going, give me fruit lips and you guys have been like, what do\n\n01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000\nyou mean?\n\n01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:49.760\nDo you want to be socially conscious and I'm like, I don't know, depends if I have to or\n\n01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:50.760\nnot.\n\n01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:57.400\nAnd then, but then like, there was this marking point of like January 2018, where it was like,\n\n01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:04.440\nokay, strategically and hell, for every reason in every column, Dan, you're not allowed to\n\n01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:09.000\nsay what you're feeling and thinking.\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:14.040\nAnd what is a tantrum that it's like, it's the most obnoxious horrible thing and we associate\n\n01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:18.200\nit with children and we're like, you piece of shit, you should never look at that fucking\n\n01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:25.080\nand we blame and we look, you're in the airport and you hear a kid going like, like, we hate\n\n01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.080\nthem.\n\n01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:30.240\nIt's like, terrible, terrible little people, they're having a fucking tantrum in the middle\n\n01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.240\nof an airport.\n\n01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:37.120\nLike, our species, maybe that's the, that's the next wheel is like, can we find it?\n\n01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:38.880\nBecause what are we having right now politically?\n\n01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:42.440\nWe're having tantrums, tantrums over everyone's having a fucking tantrum.\n\n01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:50.400\nI mean, so, okay, a couple of things, one, we'll get there though, we'll get there.\n\n01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:56.920\nAge Cage, it's a, it's a concept that's like Japanese therapy that was very hilariously\n\n01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:01.880\nused in the show, Delocated, which is like a criminally underrated show.\n\n01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:06.560\nAnd it's just a room that they set up and they just give you a fucking hammer.\n\n01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:11.880\nAnd it's just like a scene and a fucking old TV and, and I thought like another person\n\n01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:16.000\nI'm like, wait, I don't know, no, no, no, yeah, I'm not, I'm not a billionaire, it's\n\n01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000\ncalled murder.\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:22.600\nI'm only a millionaire, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't kill with impunity.\n\n01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:29.360\nUm, no, it's, it's, it's just stuff, it's property, which is not violence, it's vandalism\n\n01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.520\nwhen property is destroyed, and therefore it's fine.\n\n01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.920\nYeah, but it's anyone, whatever, I'm not going to poo poo that, thank you for sharing\n\n01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:35.920\nit with me.\n\n01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:39.080\nSo there's that, then the other thing I would say is like politically speaking at least,\n\n01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:44.200\nsorry to be uncle fucking socialism, but if we get rid of-\n\n01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.200\nHis name is Uncle Stahl.\n\n01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:46.200\nAt least he apologized.\n\n01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:47.200\nYeah.\n\n01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:51.740\nIf we get rid of all the horrible things that we are willingly participating in and also\n\n01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:55.960\njust make things better in the way that we absolutely know is possible, then everybody\n\n01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:59.720\nwouldn't feel like screaming all the time, because you just feel like a crazy person\n\n01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:01.600\nbecause you're like, we all know better than this.\n\n01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:05.400\nWell, can I bring up a thing that I'm really jealous of our forebearers of, which is that,\n\n01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:09.400\nand maybe this is the oversimplification that happens when you, you look backwards because\n\n01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:15.600\nmaybe it wasn't simple back then, but like all these historical chapters that we look\n\n01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:20.720\nat counter culturally, it's always the people that are unashamed versus the people that\n\n01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:21.800\nare ashamed.\n\n01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:24.120\nAnd we don't have that culture war going on right now.\n\n01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:29.360\nWe have two different kinds of people that are both like willing to engage in shame and\n\n01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:33.600\nfear arguing with each other about which type of shame should pay, which type of dividend\n\n01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:34.920\nand which amount.\n\n01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:37.240\nAnd it's like, how are you going to win that fight?\n\n01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:43.080\nLike there's got to be some way to fucking move this line so that it's like in that classic\n\n01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:48.600\ntradition of like, look, man, you can fucking make fun of everybody you want.\n\n01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:53.200\nYou can like harass anyone you want, but if you're harassing them, they're on my side.\n\n01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:54.200\nI don't fucking care.\n\n01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:58.820\nLike I am not signing up for this Boy Scout troop where everyone dresses the same and doesn't\n\n01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:04.880\nhave any fun and let the enemy say, no, we have fun and let them prove it because they\n\n01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:05.880\ncan't.\n\n01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.880\nHey, man, that is happening.\n\n01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:12.320\nBut they can prove that they have fun when they're trolling us and watching us dance like\n\n01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.320\nmonkeys.\n\n01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:16.400\nSo we're going like, whoa, whoa, whoa, someone told me that there's something outrageous\n\n01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:19.720\nover here and they're laughing all the way to the fucking troll bank.\n\n01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.720\nLike it's like, we got to take that power.\n\n01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:22.720\nI hate that bank.\n\n01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:24.920\nVote no on the troll bank.\n\n01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:25.920\nThat pays nothing.\n\n01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:29.160\nWe got to, we got to figure out how to put that in the hands of the city.\n\n01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:32.320\nIt's such as the troll bank just traffics in like Pepe Bitcoin.\n\n01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:37.760\nWe got to get, we got to, you got to answer three riddles before you can get a deposit.\n\n01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:39.560\nSo the bank's going to be under a bridge.\n\n01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:40.560\nI know.\n\n01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:46.560\nI think like the thing that they're now delighting it is like just overt racism's because that's\n\n01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:51.800\nthey have kind of been retreated to a point where it's like, I guess we got to take pride\n\n01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:58.320\nin this because you know, Taylor Swift is mad at us and Kanye stopped being into politics\n\n01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.320\nnow.\n\n01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:02.760\nYou know, well, yeah, there's going to be a treasure trove to the extent that we progressed\n\n01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:07.080\nto the point where 10 years ago everyone was racist, then that means that everyone can\n\n01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:11.720\nnow go back 10 years and find something racist, you said, which we should all be mindful of\n\n01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:13.160\nand go, yeah, shit changes.\n\n01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:19.880\nI was fucking, I said shit that is bad 10 years ago, but we are in this mode.\n\n01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:24.520\nI think of like, that my only point, I'm not even starting to say, you know what we need\n\n01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:25.520\nto do?\n\n01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:31.000\nI only came up because talking about tantrums, I think the reason why tantrums are so exciting\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.400\nto me right now is because actually we're constantly throwing them online at each other.\n\n01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:42.640\nEven people that are on our side, we are just frothing at the math, and if you told a Martian\n\n01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:47.840\nwhat level of technology we were at and then said, you know, they would say, oh, so.\n\n01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:50.160\nWe've achieved tantrum technology.\n\n01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:53.640\nWait, wait, wait, well, if you told them we've achieved the technology where anyone from\n\n01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:58.720\nany device, no matter what their income level, basically like with the price of a fucking book\n\n01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:03.240\nof matches, you could basically have an opportunity to type anything anywhere and it would be seen\n\n01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:07.000\nby everyone, depending on whether or not anyone thought it was worth reading.\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.720\nThat all sounds to me like the Martian would go, oh, so you probably have a lot less frothing\n\n01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:15.000\nat the mouth than fucking crazy tirades, right?\n\n01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.280\nAnd it's like, and then you go, no, the opposite.\n\n01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:21.600\nThe Martian would go, well, then something must be wrong that you're not telling me.\n\n01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.840\nThe technology is so new.\n\n01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:27.480\nWe've never before been so plugged into what's happening exactly everywhere.\n\n01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:31.320\nAnd like our brains aren't used to like being like, hey, here's this horrible thing happening\n\n01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:34.040\nin a country I'm just telling you about.\n\n01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:38.200\nFor the first time ever, you're going to learn about a brand new country because of a horrible\n\n01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.200\nthing that's happened.\n\n01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:40.880\nAll that information is new.\n\n01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:44.680\nBut something that's not new is something that a lot of our parents like kept telling\n\n01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:49.160\nus in kindergarten teachers, which is like, if you don't have something nice to say, don't\n\n01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:50.160\nsay anything at all.\n\n01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:54.080\nIf you don't have like golden rule shit that we think goes out the window because we're\n\n01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:58.320\nlooking at something that excites us, that traumatizes us.\n\n01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:02.800\nWe believe that there's a deal breaker that's present and well, but yeah, but it's on my\n\n01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:07.840\nphone and it's like, no, motherfucker, that's exactly the point where you're being tested.\n\n01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:08.840\nRight.\n\n01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:12.200\nWell, it's because you're not looking at a human being and getting the facial recognitions\n\n01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:13.680\nof like, oh, you're a person.\n\n01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:16.280\nYou're not going to get your ass kicked, for instance.\n\n01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:18.520\nYou're not going to get punched in the face.\n\n01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:22.400\nYou're not going to have to not make eye contact with someone that's more powerful than you.\n\n01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:24.720\nAll this shit that we should be a three worse thing.\n\n01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:30.680\nWe should be ashamed of as far as incentivizations to express ourselves or not.\n\n01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:35.240\nThat's another reason why we're being tested and trained by this technology.\n\n01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:42.440\nIt's like, oh, I just watched a guy get shot to death on a street and I watched the cops\n\n01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:45.440\ngun tremble in his hand.\n\n01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:50.960\nAnd then I have a bad day at work and then my therapist goes like, yeah, but don't you\n\n01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:55.960\nthink your body knew you saw that and I'm going like, yeah, but I didn't talk about\n\n01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:56.960\nit.\n\n01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:57.960\nI didn't retweet it.\n\n01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:58.960\nI didn't.\n\n01:37:58.960 --> 01:37:59.960\nYeah.\n\n01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:00.960\nBut you fucking took it in.\n\n01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:01.960\nYou're being traumatized.\n\n01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:06.880\nNow, it's not like we need to turn our backs on that, but it's like we are currently acting\n\n01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:13.320\nlike it's normal to watch people get shot and killed like it's normal to wake up every\n\n01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:18.720\nday to the news that everyone's a piece of shit and that we're all going to die, which\n\n01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:23.600\nmay or may not be true, I'm not saying that's a lie, but it's fucking weird messaging to\n\n01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:28.160\nget when you wake up and I'm telling you, we didn't get it when I was a kid every day.\n\n01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:29.640\nFred Durst didn't come on this fucking TV.\n\n01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:35.920\nI got the message when I was your age that Snoopy hated Mondays, like depending on you.\n\n01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:38.720\nWell, you got that message wrong.\n\n01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:39.720\nIt's Garfield.\n\n01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:40.720\nThere was, there was.\n\n01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:45.800\nYou got it that we just kicked the Kaiser's ass.\n\n01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.880\nI'm sure Snoopy hated Mondays too, died by fire.\n\n01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:49.880\nWhoa.\n\n01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:54.120\nSpeaking of fire, speaking of fire, you're really haunting the F house, dude.\n\n01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:56.000\nOh man, haunting the F house.\n\n01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000\nNo, no.\n\n01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000\nYou're ancient.\n\n01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000\nToo many times.\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000\nToo many times.\n\n01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000\nToo many times.\n\n01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.800\nWell, whatever, I'm, I'm, it's tantrum, tantrum technology.\n\n01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:06.800\nThat's what we need.\n\n01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:07.800\nWe need, we need.\n\n01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:08.800\nYeah.\n\n01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:09.800\nPrimal scream assisting technology.\n\n01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:13.920\nI think like truly because I'm telling you, I'm still walking around.\n\n01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:18.560\nAnd I can now measure it by therapy because my therapist will ask me what's happening\n\n01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.560\nin here.\n\n01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:24.520\nI have a column of rage inside of me that I can measure and observe.\n\n01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:26.960\nAnd I don't have to act on it because I'm 45.\n\n01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:29.760\nI can just let it sit and burn.\n\n01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:31.760\nBut I know when it's zero.\n\n01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:34.680\nI know when I'm like a fucking kite in the wind.\n\n01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:39.960\nAnd I'm like, whoa, here you go, Pearl Jam and lyrics and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,\n\n01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:40.960\nblah, blah.\n\n01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:43.280\nLike, like, I feel, I feel it every once in a while.\n\n01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:47.560\nYou become drunk any better, but it keeps tight any better.\n\n01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:48.840\nIt keeps filling up.\n\n01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.040\nIt fills up.\n\n01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.040\nAnd then you can feel it.\n\n01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:55.760\nYou know, it's, it's, it's, it's, you can, you can punch a wall and have it really not\n\n01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:56.760\ngo down.\n\n01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:57.760\nRight.\n\n01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:58.760\nThere is.\n\n01:39:58.760 --> 01:39:59.760\nYou really punch a wall and really bloody your knuckles.\n\n01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.760\nI punch it.\n\n01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:01.760\nI've been punching it.\n\n01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:07.360\nI have punched more walls this year than I punched the year I got divorced.\n\n01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:11.360\nLike, like, I, and, and, and it's been in the last couple of months.\n\n01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:20.000\nAnd it's been because of outrage, uh, about shit that I, uh, can't talk about.\n\n01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.680\nAnd it's largely been about that meta fact that I can't fucking talk about it.\n\n01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:27.840\nSo I punch a fucking wall because what the, what else am I going to do?\n\n01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:36.400\nThe alternative would be to pollute my relationship with Cody, to pollute my, my workplace, to,\n\n01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:44.960\nwhere do you go when you are filled with just a foundational fucking incompatibility with\n\n01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:47.000\na planet full of idiots?\n\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000\nTJ Maxx.\n\n01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:53.880\nThat's their slogan, right?\n\n01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:56.040\nI think it's self-destructive of them.\n\n01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:57.040\nYeah.\n\n01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:01.680\nI think, I think, I think it flew in the face of their base, but where do you go when you\n\n01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:09.480\nhave a foundational incompatibility with a planet of idiots, TJ Maxx.\n\n01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:10.480\nIt's catchy.\n\n01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:11.480\nYou gotta give them that.\n\n01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:14.200\nAll this summer, men's pants are two by two.\n\n01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:15.200\nWe got shelves and stuff.\n\n01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.200\nI don't know how clothes work.\n\n01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:17.200\nYeah.\n\n01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:20.360\nDo they sell them, like, animals on the Ark?\n\n01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:26.600\nYeah, marching on the Ark, two by two, hurrah, hurrah.\n\n01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:33.160\nI think that, I mean, I don't know, I feel like there's a lot of people right now who\n\n01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:36.560\njust have a voice for the first time with the internet.\n\n01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:41.240\nThere are folks in marginalized groups that are speaking up for the first time.\n\n01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:47.560\nThere are people who are like us, who are white men, who aren't really used to being\n\n01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:53.200\nchallenged a lot that's happening now, and it's up to us to just sort of be like, well,\n\n01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:57.000\nyou know, we kinda just gotta suck it up and deal because boy, oh boy, has it been easy\n\n01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000\nto be a white man.\n\n01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.480\nAnd certainly a credit card debt to pay.\n\n01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:03.640\nI'm really glad you brought that up, because not only did three years ago on this podcast\n\n01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:12.960\nthat I knew, I wanted to make sure I acknowledged that, that as far as voting concerns, on this\n\n01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:18.840\nvery podcast, I have changed from a guy who was like, your vote doesn't matter, boo, boo,\n\n01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.760\nand I was in my 40s saying that.\n\n01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.080\nI used to say it, too.\n\n01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:25.760\nSo that, you know, but if you asked me at that time, I'd like to say if you asked me\n\n01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:30.560\nwhat my deal breaker was, I would have, I would say, I don't know, a fascist coup, but\n\n01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:34.640\nhowever, like, I'm glad you brought, that's the more important thing to bring up, because\n\n01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.560\nI was 25 once, and I'm gonna give it 20 years ago.\n\n01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:47.520\nAnd when I was 25, yeah, I mean, if I was living in this world now, would I leave an\n\n01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:56.480\nInstagram comment on a man's Instagram, whose cartoon I liked telling him to get back to\n\n01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:00.040\nwork because his cartoon's like, no, never, no, those people are horrible.\n\n01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:01.040\nYeah, they are.\n\n01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:09.000\nHowever, but, but, but, but, you know, but now they have a voice, but, but, but a lot\n\n01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:16.120\nof the people who, who are saying things like, we have been, we've been equalized, like,\n\n01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:23.840\nyou can't, it's the very beginning of the start of a whisper of it from a emotionally\n\n01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:30.080\nretarded 19 year old from a 25 year old who's been abused as a child from a 36 year old.\n\n01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:34.520\nThat's like, like the, all of that shit is out the window, which is probably ultimately\n\n01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:38.560\nif we survive this rapture, a better thing than a worse thing.\n\n01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:44.440\nBecause throwing out biological strata is probably going to could benefit us if we\n\n01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:45.440\nsurvive this.\n\n01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:49.560\nYeah, we're all going to need to work together to survive the horrible things that are in\n\n01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:52.120\nstore for us in the future.\n\n01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:56.360\nBut I guess that means that if you're a 45 year old and you're like, I hate the world,\n\n01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:01.560\nlike the test upon you, if I expect today's 25 year old to comport themselves with some\n\n01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:05.120\ndignity when they're leaving comments on my girlfriend's Instagram, there should also\n\n01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:09.920\nbe that I have to look at myself as Gandalf and go, well, you have responsibilities to\n\n01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:10.920\nkind of.\n\n01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:18.640\nLike, if Peregrine took, knocks a barrel down a well, like, what if Gandalf had just been\n\n01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:22.680\nlike, you piece of shit, I'm going to skin you alive.\n\n01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:28.920\nAnd then the ogre's came and he's like, just take him, I don't care, I fucking hate Middle\n\n01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:29.920\nEarth.\n\n01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:30.920\nDid you know wizards aren't even men?\n\n01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:36.200\nThey're like a different species in this world, I'm a fucking elite, I'm out of here,\n\n01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:39.200\nteleport, level nine.\n\n01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:43.080\nI'm Gandalf the purple in a world without dipshits.\n\n01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:47.200\nI come here for fun.\n\n01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:52.320\nI love the image of Gandalf being like boring.\n\n01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:55.280\nHe kind of does big deal.\n\n01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:56.440\nHe does do that.\n\n01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:01.800\nBut I'm realizing now, okay, maybe don't be irritated by him because he also he's the\n\n01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:06.680\nacid test is he goes, you shall not pass to a fucking ball rock.\n\n01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:11.560\nHe's out there and he says, fly you fools.\n\n01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:16.200\nTo be fair to him, he gets to apparently live through that, which no one else does.\n\n01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:19.080\nLike, oh, hey, where are you?\n\n01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:25.680\nWell, I lost that fight to the demon and fell through a thing and then I am back.\n\n01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:26.680\nI think he won.\n\n01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:32.120\nYeah, that's a good metaphor for the structural benefit that being a white man has in this\n\n01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:33.120\nsociety.\n\n01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:34.960\nYou don't have to fight the ball rock that hard.\n\n01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:35.960\nRight.\n\n01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:38.200\nYeah, you just become Gandalf the white.\n\n01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:46.800\nYeah, Gandalf the toxic male white, Gandalf the Gandalf the white fragile, the fragile\n\n01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:50.840\nwhite gun owner.\n\n01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:56.240\nYou could take my staff for my cold dead hands.\n\n01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:57.920\nI didn't buy it because I'm conservative.\n\n01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:01.640\nI bought it because they're rude in the world.\n\n01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:05.920\nI don't know why I'm using this voice when that's literally my justification for having\n\n01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:07.420\nbought a gun.\n\n01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:08.420\nDid you buy a gun?\n\n01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:09.920\nYeah, because I might kill myself.\n\n01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:10.920\nOh, all right.\n\n01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:14.520\nWell, that's actually a reason, I mean, because that's one of the things that might happen\n\n01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:15.520\nwhen you buy one.\n\n01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:16.520\nNo, that's not true.\n\n01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:17.520\nI was supposed to get a laugh too.\n\n01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:18.520\nAll right.\n\n01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:19.520\nIt's true.\n\n01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:25.760\nLike, it's probably true that I would maybe right.\n\n01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:28.040\nThat's why everyone didn't laugh.\n\n01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:33.800\nDan, let's talk about how satire works.\n\n01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:40.440\nWell, satire works truth and jest, I mean, but I'm like, like, no, it's just because\n\n01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:46.520\nif I were to ever, like, for instance, I would never, I'm never going to kill myself because\n\n01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:51.600\nunless unless I would never as Cody dies.\n\n01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:56.920\nIf Cody dies, my promise is not broken if Cody, if he's already backtracked.\n\n01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:02.360\nSo what you've just said is you'll never kill myself.\n\n01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:03.360\nWait a second.\n\n01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:04.960\nYou have not ruled out murder, suicide.\n\n01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:05.960\nThat's good to know.\n\n01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:07.200\nNo, no, I'm not going to murder Cody.\n\n01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:11.400\nThat's a strange read, but technically true.\n\n01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:12.400\nIt was interesting.\n\n01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:17.080\nIt was interesting in a Shimali on a kind of yeah, I like the way you're
