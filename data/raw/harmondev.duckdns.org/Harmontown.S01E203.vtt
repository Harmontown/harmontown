Thank you.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:43.000\nOh, thank you.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:47.000\nYeah, blips and chips. That's my shirt.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:54.000\nDan, do you know that tomorrow would be our fourth anniversary of the first Harmontown?\n\n00:54.000 --> 01:03.000\nYeah, it's the fourth anniversary, Dan.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:07.000\nHow do we keep it so fresh after all these years?\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:10.000\nYeah, no. I have no idea. I don't know.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:16.000\nThat's going to be a bad show. I've been having a very relaxing weekend.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:19.000\nAnd you know how it gets, you know, your energy flags a little bit.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:26.000\nYou start playing your cookies and like that fucking Transformers game you're playing.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:31.000\nTransformers Earth Wars.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:34.000\nIt's Clash of Clans with Transformers.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:36.000\nJeff's playing it.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:39.000\nYou don't have to play it, Dan.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:42.000\nAre you also playing Clash of Clans or are you...\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:45.000\nI think I'm starting to trail off on the Clash of Clans\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:50.000\nbecause now I get to be an Optimus Prime or a Bumblebee.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:53.000\nI wanted to tell you guys, all I can really share with you\n\n01:53.000 --> 02:00.000\nis the result of good seven hours of forensic file viewing today.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:06.000\nI can tell you that pubic hairs travel or migrate.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:08.000\nI wrote that down. That was so funny.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:10.000\nFrom room to room.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:12.000\nI noticed like they reused...\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:14.000\nWait, by their own volition?\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:16.000\nDo they have to hitch a ride on time?\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:20.000\nThat's why I think they use the phrase travel or migrate\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:24.000\nbecause they said either travel or migrate the first time by itself\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:28.000\nand then they're like, people are going to think they're like alive like worms.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:32.000\nBut I saw the episode where they really walked you through\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:41.000\nfinding out that pubic hairs travel or migrate to different rooms.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:44.000\nWait, tell me more about pubic hair migration.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:47.000\nTell me more about your weird friend.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:54.000\nYou saw him too?\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:57.000\nA fellow. What is your name, good sir?\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:58.000\nLuke.\n\n02:58.000 --> 02:59.000\nThank you, brother.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:04.000\nHe just spirited me up a little airport bottle of Frenet Bronca\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:08.000\nto which I say, hooray and hurrah.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:11.000\nWhich I will now drink on podcast form.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:28.000\nSo, there was a case where there are these dead children.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:32.000\nDon't mention dead children around, Jeff.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:35.000\nThere were these dead children and they wanted to know who killed them\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:38.000\nand there were pubic hairs of course everywhere\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:43.000\nand the pubic hairs matched this guy who lived with the family.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:48.000\nI'm not laughing at the death of the children.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:54.000\nI'm just laughing at the volume of forensic files that just desensitizes you\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.000\nand that's what you're in the market for is desensitization.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:02.000\nYou keep making these jokes about people's haircuts and stuff and they're crying.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:06.000\nAnd there's just pubic hairs everywhere and they were like,\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:09.000\nwell, fuck, well, the guy lived with them.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:13.000\nThey were like, dude, we found your pubic hairs in the kid's room\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:17.000\nand the guy's like, so fucking, I lived there.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nPubic hairs get around.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nHe's got to be right, right?\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:26.000\nAnd that's the guy.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:30.000\nThis forensics guy is like, he's doing his interview\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:35.000\nand he goes, so, we had to come up with a new science.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:39.000\nSo I went home and I vacuumed my whole house really well\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.000\nand I tell you, the house has never been cleaner.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:46.000\nAnd he stopped and I was like, that guy's one moment of joy\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:49.000\nfor that whole year.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:55.000\nBut he vacuumed his whole house and then he vacuumed it regular times\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.000\nand counted the pubic hairs.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:03.000\nLike, he had to figure out how, can you imagine being that guy's daughter?\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:06.000\nWhat are you doing, dad?\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:11.000\nHe's like, you know, the guy is like in the middle of a science\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:14.000\nthat needs to be like, it's got peer review and stuff.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:17.000\nSo he's like at home and he's like, this could help bring a murderer to justice.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:21.000\nAnd it's like, I need to make sure that I don't while eating breakfast\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\nor watching television or anything.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:30.000\nI never engage in any activities that go beyond the average amount of pubic hair affectation.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:37.000\nI don't want to have a crazy like dance party\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:40.000\nand take off my pants and shake my pelvis around\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:44.000\nbecause what if they find that out and then they're like,\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:48.000\nbecause he had to find out how far does the average pubic hair go, you know?\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:52.000\nAnd it turns out pubic hairs travel or migrate\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:55.000\nprimarily on sock surfaces.\n\n05:55.000 --> 06:02.000\nYeah, you step on a pubic hair, you're smuggling pubes at that point.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:07.000\nBut more than hairs off your head or hairs off your arm?\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:11.000\nNo, no, no, not more than hairs off your head, no.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nJust enough that there's some pubic hairs.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:17.000\nIf you have a kid, some of your pubic hairs are in your kid's bedroom,\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:22.000\nbut not so many and then they started getting into the minutia of like,\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:27.000\nyeah, but these were fresh, moist pubic hairs.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:30.000\nBut those stick to socks more than any other kind.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:34.000\nAnd then the forensic guy was talking about other pubic hairs\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:37.000\nhe was finding in his kid's bedroom.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:43.000\nWere dry and had been bitten by a mite larvae, you know?\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:48.000\nBut the world this guy lives in, the world his children live in.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:52.000\nBut this pubic hair was holding a picture of today's New York Times.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:02.000\nWas he acquitted? This guy could offer to you.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nSo the guy that works for the forensic side,\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nI think he went to jail after the whole thing was over.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nHis kids like filed charges.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:13.000\nI was trying to save a life. No, everyone's dead.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:16.000\nYou're just trying to be the best pubic hair detector.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:22.000\nAnd you need to stop. It's like a beautiful mind, I think.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nThat's hard work being the world's best pubic hair detective.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:29.000\nAnyways.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:34.000\nOh, and I was also thinking because, okay, so while he was talking about the pubic hair migration,\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:39.000\nyou saw this black and white footage of people, their heads were out of frame,\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:43.000\nbut you just saw it like it was like a lockdown camera shot\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nand then just like different family members,\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:49.000\nlike different aged people putting on socks and taking them off\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:52.000\nand like walking around and like just walking through frame.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:58.000\nAnd then there was another case that it was pubic hair reliant.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:02.000\nAnd so they used that footage again.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:06.000\nAnd Cody and I were like, oh my God, it's the pubic hair migration footage.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:11.000\nAnd then also that required vacuuming.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nAnd it was like, oh, that's the same vacuum cleaner.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:16.000\nOh, they're cutting up and looking through the layers of the vacuum bag.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:22.000\nSo I was thinking like they must be so stoked at forensic files when a new murder happens\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:26.000\nand it uses all the elements of their stock footage.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nTheir budget's cut in half.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:33.000\nLike someone got strangled with pubic hair by a vacuum cleaner salesman.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nBut then you get a guy that's like a producer that was about to get fired\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nand he starts committing pubic hair murders.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:42.000\nYeah, just to get to drive the budget down.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:47.000\nIt's like firemen starting fires.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:52.000\nYeah, the forensics files budget is too high.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nI don't know about, well, yeah, it doesn't make any sense.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:58.000\nHe starts committing non-pubic hair murders.\n\n08:58.000 --> 08:59.000\nThat's what it is.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:03.000\nThe network says like, look, your show's on autopilot, man.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nBudgetarily, you've got it all knocked out.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:06.000\nI can do it.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nYou take the pubic hair footage.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:08.000\nYou take the bloody knife.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nYou take the lady coming home from shopping.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:15.000\nAnd you put this thing together, you say, murder.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nAnd then you get an episode.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nAnd then the producer was like, fuck, there goes my kid's pool.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nAnd then he like...\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:24.000\nHe was building his kid his own pool.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:35.000\nSo he removes all of his pubic hair and becomes the alopecia strangler.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nAnd then there's an episode about it.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:43.000\nAnd he's like, yeah, it's like a cool movie about that guy's double life.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nAnd you're on his side because it's like a black comedy,\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:49.000\nlike a dark anti kind of thing.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:52.000\nHow do you catch the alopecia strangler?\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:53.000\nWhat's that forensic files like?\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:54.000\nWell, he slips up.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:55.000\nYou know, I don't know.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nHe gets caught by his own people.\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:00.000\nNobody on those shows, by the way, they never get caught by the cops.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:01.000\nIt's always...\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nA phone call.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:03.000\nA tip.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:04.000\nThe drinking game with forensic files.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:09.000\nThe big one is like, and then police received a call that they've been waiting for.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nThen police received a tip.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:12.000\nHe changed everything.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nA guy just told me he is the alopecia strangler.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:18.000\nIt's always like a guy in prison that's like, hey, this guy I've been in prison with\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:21.000\nmurdered like 90 people before you caught him jaywalking.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:28.000\nAnd then they let the three people they put in prison for the crime go at the end.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:33.000\nAnd they're all gold and gray and they fall down as they're leaving the prison from the\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:38.000\nweight of the $8 they got from the state.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:39.000\nDan, if you ever...\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nThere was like a crazy one where I was like, I kept rewinding it because I was like, wait,\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:43.000\nare they trying to...\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:50.000\nThis episode of forensic files is trying to get away with murder because there was a woman\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:56.000\nin it who went to police and said, I think I know...\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.000\nI work at a massage parlor and a lot of these guys get pretty chatty.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:04.000\nAnd I think this guy is saying some weird shit.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nI'd wear a wire for you if you wanted.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:09.000\nAnd they were like, no, that's too dangerous.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:16.000\nAnd then she called them later and was like, yeah, that guy just confessed I should have\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.000\nbeen wearing a wire.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:23.000\nAnd they're like, okay, now record them and get them to do it again.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nAnd she tried and it didn't work.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:28.000\nAnd then the guy came and stabbed her after work.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:31.000\nAnd I was like, oh, so rewind it to when she was...\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:34.000\nThat's why they made that big, weird deal about how she came to them.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:37.000\nIt was like, we told her it was too dangerous.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:38.000\nLike, no, you didn't.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:42.000\nYou fucking jumped on it and made her some amateur sleuth or whatever, man.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:48.000\nAnd I was like, come on, man, forensic files, not forensic files, the police involved.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:52.000\nForensic files, I'm sure they killed people too.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:57.000\nYou know if it made the difference between them getting to do more forensic files and\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.000\ngetting canceled that they'd kill somebody.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:06.000\nIf that show tells you one thing, man, it's inside all of us.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:10.000\nYou released the beast.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nWe watched the Purge movies this weekend.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:16.000\nAll two of the ones available at home.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:19.000\nPurge 2, definitely better than Purge 1.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:25.000\nThat's a lot like, you know, turds with peanuts in them are better than regular turds.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:32.000\nBut the Purge, just because I don't know what you're measuring by peanuts, it's gross.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:33.000\nIt's a gross image.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nYou don't want to think about it, but technically speaking...\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:39.000\nSpencer, if you had to choose between turds or turds with peanuts, what are you taking?\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nAre people swallowing these peanuts whole?\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nHow does that work?\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nYou got to chew those peanuts.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:45.000\nYeah.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:50.000\nHow would you tell the difference between any other thing that was in your poop?\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nThey would taste like peanuts.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nYou wouldn't say it's like...\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:55.000\nIs this one of those things?\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nIt's like corn, corn in the cellulose.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nCorn is different than peanuts, man.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:02.000\nWhatever.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nI didn't get a lot of sleep.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:08.000\nLet me tell you what happened when I was trying to go to sleep last night.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nGreat.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:10.000\nI was going to go to sleep.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nI'm laying down, laying down in my bed.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nI'm relaxing.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.000\nI got a fart.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:17.000\nAnd I fart.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:21.000\nAnd I just shit all over the place.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nJust so much shit.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nI'm lightheaded.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:28.000\nAnd I'm getting dizzy from all this shit.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nAnd I can't move.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nAnd I'm just paralyzed.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nYou shit so much.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:38.000\nYou depleted your blood flow to your brain.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:39.000\nYeah.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nIt was terrifying.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nAnd then I woke up.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nAnd it was sleep paralysis.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nAnd I was completely dry.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:53.000\nBut it was really terrifying because I thought I was literally shitting my brains out.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:56.000\nAnd then I couldn't get back to sleep for like hours.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:58.000\nBut you had not shit yourself.\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\nNo.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:02.000\nI didn't even have to shit.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nIt was part of the confusion and the fear.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:07.000\nAs soon as you were able to move, you started for the bathroom and you were like,\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nwait, wait, it's all good.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nI guess I'll lay down and what I was convinced was my shit.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nYeah.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:16.000\nI really had to convince myself it wasn't shit.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:20.000\nAnd it was not ideal from that point onward.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:24.000\nDidn't get a lot of sleep.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:28.000\nI had another dream where I was like walking through dog shit too.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nI don't know.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:34.000\nIt was fine.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:38.000\nWhat do you think all that shit related dreams signifies?\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nIt's really weird.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nI've never had that before.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:44.000\nIt was a really weird situation in my life.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nDoes anybody here know like dream analysis?\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nIt's a bullshit.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nWell, there you go.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:54.000\nI ate a whole pizza.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:55.000\nMy body might have just been working that out.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:56.000\nLarge, medium, small?\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\nWhat size pizza?\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nIt was a large Hawaiian pizza.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:00.000\nA whole large Hawaiian?\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:01.000\nYeah.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:02.000\nOkay.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:03.000\nThat's heroic.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.000\nYeah.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:05.000\nYou deserve to dream about shitting yourself to death.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:06.000\nThat's the thing.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:09.000\nMy body was just terrified.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:17.000\nI ate something that really had me going in the fart department, which I refused to call\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:26.000\nthe department because I don't want to get too used to this stuff.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:31.000\nI was like, really, I went to Cliff's Edge over, it doesn't matter where I went.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:32.000\nIt's a nice restaurant.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nThey got a back patio.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:37.000\nI haven't really seen Cody all week.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:41.000\nFor a long time, they got a holiday weekend together.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:47.000\nWent out in a back patio at one of LA's fine summer breeze restaurants and had some silly\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:50.000\nfood for artsy farts.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:55.000\nSomething in one of them, I don't know if I'm lactose intolerant and there was like\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:59.000\na milk fish or something.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.000\nI was farting so much.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:11.000\nWith Cody, I went through a whole, with McGathey, we decided at the outset, let's not fart\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:12.000\nin front of each other.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:15.000\nI've been doing that for a couple of girlfriends.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nA zero fart policy.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:24.000\nI got the idea from Sarah Silverman, her relationship with Jimmy Kimmel, which she was in when I was\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:31.000\nworking with her, she said at one point, I don't fart in front of Jimmy and vice versa.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nWe don't do that.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nI was like, really, what?\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nDon't you think that's dishonest and unnatural?\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:44.000\nShe's like, is it dishonest to not fart all over the person you say you love?\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:47.000\nWhat are you telling them with that expression?\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:52.000\nThey're like your hillbilly brother or you're shocked if the sex goes away or whatever.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:56.000\nI was like, okay, that's a totally different perspective and I've never even entertained\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nit.\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:01.400\nThen I looked back at previous relationships and I was like, God, yeah, man, you really\n\n17:01.400 --> 17:10.000\nget programmed by your kind of family's class system or their aesthetic.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nThere's a lot of stuff you don't even second guess.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:18.200\nI would always celebrate becoming intimate with a woman by really starting to fart a\n\n17:18.200 --> 17:19.200\nlot.\n\n17:19.200 --> 17:25.200\nSo I started tapering it off and thinking, yeah, why don't you just go in the other room\n\n17:25.200 --> 17:26.200\nif you had a fart so bad?\n\n17:26.200 --> 17:30.200\nWhat's so funny about poopy farts?\n\n17:30.200 --> 17:31.200\nStop it.\n\n17:31.200 --> 17:32.200\nSo you and Cody are-\n\n17:32.200 --> 17:38.200\nBut Cody kind of was swinging back the other way because she was like, but it's like a\n\n17:38.200 --> 17:39.200\npendulum.\n\n17:39.200 --> 17:43.000\nWith McGathey, and I don't think it wasn't like McGathey's demand, she just liked the\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:44.000\nidea too.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:50.200\nI think we just really never farted in front of each other.\n\n17:50.200 --> 17:53.400\nCody, I'm letting him rip a little bit.\n\n17:53.400 --> 17:56.640\nA little bit.\n\n17:56.640 --> 18:01.560\nLike I'm pushing the envelope.\n\n18:01.560 --> 18:03.000\nYou're trying to blow her mind?\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:08.600\nWell, it's like I'll do it.\n\n18:08.600 --> 18:09.600\nName a key.\n\n18:09.600 --> 18:10.600\nF sharp.\n\n18:10.600 --> 18:11.600\nMerep.\n\n18:11.600 --> 18:16.600\nI feel like splitting the differences like you do one and then you go like, uh-oh.\n\n18:16.600 --> 18:20.600\nI was like, what was that?\n\n18:20.600 --> 18:26.600\nI think a mouse was moving a dresser.\n\n18:26.600 --> 18:28.600\nBack to the 50s kind of.\n\n18:28.600 --> 18:31.800\nI think it's duck season.\n\n18:31.800 --> 18:38.440\nHave you done this long enough for the experiment to prove itself that affects sex life?\n\n18:38.440 --> 18:42.640\nSo far, still, I'm still creepy.\n\n18:42.640 --> 18:50.640\nYeah, no, it hasn't really, I don't think it's changing anything.\n\n18:50.640 --> 18:52.160\nBut I'm going by laughter.\n\n18:52.160 --> 18:56.760\nLike if it's not going to make her laugh, then I'm not going to, I think that's a thing.\n\n18:56.760 --> 19:00.280\nIt's not about whether or not they don't throw anything at you.\n\n19:00.280 --> 19:07.240\nIt should be if they stop laughing, then maybe wait until it's funny again.\n\n19:07.240 --> 19:11.960\nSo I, like, a couple nights ago, I was like, I'm always more awake than her.\n\n19:11.960 --> 19:17.120\nAnd so then I'll like, I do one, and she'll go like, that sounded so sharp.\n\n19:17.120 --> 19:21.200\nI'll talk about it for a little bit, yeah, it was really sharp.\n\n19:21.200 --> 19:26.640\nAnd then like 10 minutes later, I'll do another one and it's like, I was like, did you hear\n\n19:26.640 --> 19:27.640\nthat?\n\n19:27.640 --> 19:28.640\nYeah.\n\n19:28.640 --> 19:31.720\nAll right, so then you pull back.\n\n19:31.720 --> 19:35.480\nThen the next one, you go in the basement.\n\n19:35.480 --> 19:41.320\nBut is there a blue sky fart where you fart and it completely makes everything amazing?\n\n19:41.320 --> 19:46.320\nWell, I did one today that I swear, yeah, I mean, you've had, like today I did one and\n\n19:46.320 --> 19:47.960\nshe was just sound asleep.\n\n19:47.960 --> 19:50.800\nLike I was like, I'm just doing it.\n\n19:50.800 --> 19:55.280\nIt was like, I was sitting up in bed playing some iPad game and it was like building and\n\n19:55.280 --> 19:59.840\nlike, and then I kind of laid down for a bit and was like snuggling and, and then I was\n\n19:59.840 --> 20:04.920\njust like, I'm just going to, I'm just going to see what's, what's going on here.\n\n20:04.920 --> 20:10.040\nAnd I swear, this is my actual estimate of the length, like, and this, maybe it won't\n\n20:10.040 --> 20:16.760\nsound identical, but this is my actual not exaggerating estimate of the length of the\n\n20:16.760 --> 20:17.760\nduration.\n\n20:17.760 --> 20:18.760\nWhoa.\n\n20:18.760 --> 20:19.760\nWhat?\n\n20:19.760 --> 20:20.760\nNo.\n\n20:20.760 --> 20:21.760\nNo.\n\n20:21.760 --> 20:43.120\nAnd then I just kind of like hung there, like in silence, like, Dan, Dan, will you marry\n\n20:43.120 --> 20:44.120\nme?\n\n20:44.120 --> 20:45.120\nThat's amazing.\n\n20:45.120 --> 20:49.560\nI went out and I touched her on the shoulder because I wanted to know, and she was like,\n\n20:49.560 --> 20:59.560\noh, well, and I, and I was like, I love you, I love you too, like, so she didn't hear it.\n\n20:59.560 --> 21:00.840\nStockholm syndrome.\n\n21:00.840 --> 21:06.520\nThat's an amazing fart.\n\n21:06.520 --> 21:12.800\nThere was a guy on forensic files who pronounced the word personality, um, personnatally.\n\n21:12.800 --> 21:20.760\nThe people on there are so crazy with their crazy hair, there should be a, there should\n\n21:20.760 --> 21:24.920\nbe a, uh, and it's also fun to watch classic forensic files because like today we saw one\n\n21:24.920 --> 21:28.920\nwhere they fucking, they took 25 minutes because they were so scared we wouldn't know what\n\n21:28.920 --> 21:30.320\nGPS was.\n\n21:30.320 --> 21:37.040\nThey're like, but, but police didn't have to follow Andrew Kressinger.\n\n21:37.040 --> 21:39.800\nThey didn't have to commercial break.\n\n21:39.800 --> 21:44.800\nThey were like, what, what, and then it comes back and the whole act was, was like, high\n\n21:44.800 --> 21:50.760\nabove the earth, 30 miles in outer space, and it was like, like, they went, there was\n\n21:50.760 --> 21:52.280\nlike, there were eight satellites.\n\n21:52.280 --> 21:54.200\nI mean, I learned how GPS works.\n\n21:54.200 --> 21:57.680\nI didn't, I didn't need to, but they didn't know we knew what it was.\n\n21:57.680 --> 22:03.960\nThey called it the global positioning system or GPS and they took the, the first letters\n\n22:03.960 --> 22:08.760\nof each word and animated them going up into the word GPS.\n\n22:08.760 --> 22:11.080\nThis was a first time thing for them.\n\n22:11.080 --> 22:13.920\nThey, they were explaining how they were using it to catch a killer.\n\n22:13.920 --> 22:16.960\nThat sounds like slow news day for them again.\n\n22:16.960 --> 22:20.920\nBy the way, if you ever kill a little girl, um, and the cops say to you, and we're not\n\n22:20.920 --> 22:25.000\nsaying you should, we're not saying you should, but here's something to, here's a pitfall.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:28.480\nHere's, here's, here's, here's a way the police are going to abuse their power.\n\n22:28.480 --> 22:29.480\nOkay.\n\n22:29.480 --> 22:30.480\nHere's three nevers.\n\n22:30.480 --> 22:31.480\nHere's three nevers.\n\n22:31.480 --> 22:32.480\nI'm killing a little girl.\n\n22:32.480 --> 22:37.080\nIf they come to you and they say like they, they go like, look, congratulations.\n\n22:37.080 --> 22:43.080\nWe know you killed that little girl, uh, and you got away with it for now, but you know\n\n22:43.080 --> 22:45.280\nthat grave's too shallow.\n\n22:45.280 --> 22:50.680\nYou know animals are going to dig it up and then it's just a matter of time.\n\n22:50.680 --> 22:58.840\nDon't go drive to the shallow grave, dig it up, take the body, put it in your trunk,\n\n22:58.840 --> 23:06.080\nrub the fibers around, drive it to another place to dig a big, deep grave and cover\n\n23:06.080 --> 23:14.600\nit up, put a flower on it and then come back home and measure twice, cut once, you know.\n\n23:14.600 --> 23:18.640\nThere's a good chance the cops aren't busting out the, that shallow grave's going to give\n\n23:18.640 --> 23:22.960\nyour, your kid's body to the dingos soon.\n\n23:22.960 --> 23:25.600\nLike they're not, they're not leaning on that until they're desperate.\n\n23:25.600 --> 23:29.440\nSo you know, take three years and go change that body.\n\n23:29.440 --> 23:34.720\nI think, I think part of the fun of killing children is like right, righting that wave\n\n23:34.720 --> 23:37.400\nof how, how shallow should I make this grave?\n\n23:37.400 --> 23:40.280\nJust for the fucking action.\n\n23:40.280 --> 23:41.280\nIt's true.\n\n23:41.280 --> 23:42.280\nJust for the fucking adrenaline.\n\n23:42.280 --> 23:43.280\nYeah.\n\n23:43.280 --> 23:44.280\nLike six feet, no.\n\n23:44.280 --> 23:45.280\nHow about three and a half?\n\n23:45.280 --> 23:47.360\nAnd you know, you're thinking like, oh, Jeff, that's crazy.\n\n23:47.360 --> 23:49.240\nWhy would you kill a kid just for the thrill?\n\n23:49.240 --> 23:53.640\nAnd we're not, again, we're not saying kill kids, uh, what we're saying is if you do,\n\n23:53.640 --> 23:57.360\nyou're not doing it to become senator.\n\n23:57.360 --> 24:00.200\nYou're not doing it to make money.\n\n24:00.200 --> 24:01.200\nYou're doing it.\n\n24:01.200 --> 24:02.200\nYou're doing it.\n\n24:02.200 --> 24:03.560\nI mean, so if you're going to do it.\n\n24:03.560 --> 24:07.160\nLike I say, do it, do it, do it, ride the edge, ride that edge.\n\n24:07.160 --> 24:08.160\nRight, right.\n\n24:08.160 --> 24:11.200\nBarry, that kid's six inches underneath some boots.\n\n24:11.200 --> 24:12.920\nIt's point break.\n\n24:12.920 --> 24:16.960\nFear causes hesitation, hesitation causes your worst fears to come true.\n\n24:16.960 --> 24:21.740\nI'm saying Barry a kid, just three inches.\n\n24:21.740 --> 24:24.520\nAnd hey, while we're at it, same topic kind of related.\n\n24:24.520 --> 24:29.080\nIf you're running for president and you're a fascist, like, uh, let go ahead, use the,\n\n24:29.080 --> 24:35.360\nuse the original artwork from the meme, like with the, uh, anti-Semitic, uh, star of David\n\n24:35.360 --> 24:36.360\non the thing.\n\n24:36.360 --> 24:38.360\nDid he see the thing?\n\n24:38.360 --> 24:40.760\nI missed the whole thing, but there was a thing.\n\n24:40.760 --> 24:46.560\nThere was a Trump did another meme, like the last one he, remember, he just finds him\n\n24:46.560 --> 24:51.120\nand then he, he's like, indisputably like, he has no help with his Twitter account.\n\n24:51.120 --> 24:53.320\nHe has no staff.\n\n24:53.320 --> 24:54.920\nI have to say, I think he does.\n\n24:54.920 --> 24:57.640\nI think this is all, it can't be that's unpremeditated.\n\n24:57.640 --> 25:01.080\nWell, there's a scary thing because there were, you know, you read sometimes articles\n\n25:01.080 --> 25:04.920\nabout his strategy, about how he tests stuff, he uses the internet to test stuff.\n\n25:04.920 --> 25:09.120\nSo if that were true, what if there were multiple tiers to his testing?\n\n25:09.120 --> 25:13.960\nSo like, what if he did have people like posting crazy, like anti-Semitic, like racist shit\n\n25:13.960 --> 25:18.680\ninto like super right of right wing, like message boards, seeing how it played with the\n\n25:18.680 --> 25:23.800\nhustler magazine crowd, then like, like flip, pumping a little air into it and bumping it\n\n25:23.800 --> 25:28.760\nup, subreddit by subreddit, and then all of a sudden he throws it out there and everyone's\n\n25:28.760 --> 25:33.160\nlike, these statistics are all wrong about black people in crime and he's like, oh, sorry\n\n25:33.160 --> 25:35.160\nabout that.\n\n25:35.160 --> 25:40.160\nLike, I know this won't blow up in my face because it's been like built up on like layers\n\n25:40.160 --> 25:41.160\nof sediment.\n\n25:41.160 --> 25:42.240\nI don't know.\n\n25:42.240 --> 25:49.640\nBut whatever the case is, he tweeted a meme, he tweeted a meme.\n\n25:49.640 --> 25:58.080\nIt was like, historic Hillary and whatever, she's made history and then there was a, and\n\n25:58.080 --> 26:02.960\nthen it was her head cut out, not cut off, cut out, like, and it was like over just a\n\n26:02.960 --> 26:05.320\nbig pile of money, it was just money in the background.\n\n26:05.320 --> 26:10.680\nAnd then there was a big red star of David, no matter how you slice it, just a big red\n\n26:10.680 --> 26:18.400\nstar of David, and inside the star of David it said, you know, most corrupt ever, most\n\n26:18.400 --> 26:19.760\ncorrupt candidate ever.\n\n26:19.760 --> 26:20.760\nSomething like that.\n\n26:20.760 --> 26:24.560\nIt was like the 20% more beef kind of like starburst thing.\n\n26:24.560 --> 26:33.720\nThe star was a star of David and then people were like, what the fuck, like, holy shit.\n\n26:33.720 --> 26:40.000\nAnd then they deleted that and like switched it and it was a red circle, and then everyone\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:44.760\nwas like, you can still see two of the six points from the star underneath the peeking\n\n26:44.760 --> 26:46.680\nout from under the red circle.\n\n26:46.680 --> 26:55.720\nI don't know, I just, I mean, just as I overheard a lady say in a candle store once, amaze\n\n26:55.720 --> 27:03.080\nballs, amaze balls, amaze balls.\n\n27:03.080 --> 27:08.800\nI guess she's only seen it in print, the word amaze balls.\n\n27:08.800 --> 27:12.040\nShe thought it was Italian.\n\n27:12.040 --> 27:18.920\nShe had what you'd call personality.\n\n27:18.920 --> 27:22.880\nSo yeah, with those two things leaked, so if you're going to kill a little girl, bury\n\n27:22.880 --> 27:27.360\nher shallow, if you're going to run for president and be a Nazi, to have Hitler's speeches\n\n27:27.360 --> 27:33.280\nnext to your bed, and fucking start tweeting those anti-Semitic tweets, there's no other\n\n27:33.280 --> 27:39.360\nreason to become president as a fascist, other one to see if we can get this started again.\n\n27:39.360 --> 27:48.640\nNews ready, let's get the way back machine going, 1932.\n\n27:48.640 --> 27:51.720\nThat's when we start making money, by the way.\n\n27:51.720 --> 27:52.720\nWho does?\n\n27:52.720 --> 27:56.880\nAmerica during fucking big ass wars, because we've gotten so good at manufacturing.\n\n27:56.880 --> 28:04.200\nNo, but that presumes that we're like the non-interventionist country that scores after\n\n28:04.200 --> 28:05.880\nthe war has already run its course.\n\n28:05.880 --> 28:10.080\nYou know, isolationist America during World War II, fucking cha-ching.\n\n28:10.080 --> 28:12.320\nYeah, but we're not isolationists anymore at all.\n\n28:12.320 --> 28:20.880\nWe're going to be, we're building a wall.\n\n28:20.880 --> 28:24.240\nWe're currently at war with the rest of the universe right now.\n\n28:24.240 --> 28:29.960\nThat's another way of saying isolationism, fighting a war on all fronts.\n\n28:29.960 --> 28:34.680\nNo, rethink that sentence.\n\n28:34.680 --> 28:36.120\nWhy am I on trial?\n\n28:36.120 --> 28:38.760\nThere's a Nazi running for president, focus on him.\n\n28:38.760 --> 28:46.040\nHe's not a Nazi, he's not Hitler, he's Mussolini, he's a blowhard asshole.\n\n28:46.040 --> 28:50.760\nAnother regular segment on this show is Jeff's surprisingly pro-Hitler thoughts.\n\n28:50.760 --> 29:03.680\nI'm not pro-Hitler, I'm saying look, he has some good ideas, hear him out, listen to him.\n\n29:03.680 --> 29:09.920\nYeah, as Proops points out on one of his podcasts, Smartest Man in the World, it's like Hitler\n\n29:09.920 --> 29:11.560\nhad a plan.\n\n29:11.560 --> 29:15.920\nHe wasn't just fucking winging it, Mussolini was more of a kind of a winging it and it's\n\n29:15.920 --> 29:17.840\nappealing to the lowest common denominator.\n\n29:17.840 --> 29:22.480\nLet's not praise Hitler just because Trump hasn't been elected yet.\n\n29:22.480 --> 29:29.000\nI'm not sure Trump can fucking come up with a plan, it's hopefully in a post-Hitler world\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:32.960\nwe're getting a little bit in the way, like there's more people going and there's more\n\n29:32.960 --> 29:33.960\ninternet.\n\n29:33.960 --> 29:39.480\nWe're going like, are you about to be a Hitler and he's like, no, I'm huge.\n\n29:39.480 --> 29:43.720\nSaying that Trump is a low-level Hitler is not praising Hitler, it's not.\n\n29:43.720 --> 29:48.080\nI'm saying, well, who cares, who's praising Hitler or praising Trump or whatever.\n\n29:48.080 --> 29:53.160\nThe important thing is that fascist dictators, they are, it's like when you put your bread\n\n29:53.160 --> 29:59.680\nout on a counter, like is the mold that grows on it a genius because it found the bread?\n\n29:59.680 --> 30:06.120\nIt's like opportunity breeds fascism.\n\n30:06.120 --> 30:10.960\nWhen countries are laid low and when the economy is fucked, when cultures start to shift so\n\n30:10.960 --> 30:16.040\nfast that there's a huge section of the population that's kind of getting disoriented and starting\n\n30:16.040 --> 30:26.480\nto worry, they revert to this instinct for authoritarianism.\n\n30:26.480 --> 30:31.320\nEven in history class, economic depression, recession, all these things, it's a potting\n\n30:31.320 --> 30:36.720\nsoil for dictators, in particular fascists who want to nationalize everything.\n\n30:36.720 --> 30:39.760\nThey pick a scapegoat and they go, what about these guys, how come they're making so much\n\n30:39.760 --> 30:43.760\nmoney or they're coming in and they're eating all our food stamps or whatever.\n\n30:43.760 --> 30:47.040\nYou pick somebody and you go like, what if we all just like-\n\n30:47.040 --> 30:50.280\nBut think about people eating food stamps, it's like just because we're called food stamps,\n\n30:50.280 --> 30:51.680\ndoesn't mean they're actual food.\n\n30:51.680 --> 30:57.880\nNo, it's just another reason to build a wall even higher, man.\n\n30:57.880 --> 31:02.040\nThe important thing to know is that when we have these conversations, you got to hand\n\n31:02.040 --> 31:06.920\nit to them or it's working because of us.\n\n31:06.920 --> 31:11.680\nWe need to really make sure that we don't blow this story off after he loses the election\n\n31:11.680 --> 31:16.080\nand there's crazy race gangs running out in the streets going, I don't know, I got all\n\n31:16.080 --> 31:26.600\namped up about this, I guess I don't care about politics no more, I'm still unemployed.\n\n31:26.600 --> 31:34.320\nWe need to understand, it's us, the orange guy with the hair, Spencer points out he's\n\n31:34.320 --> 31:39.640\nbeen running for president for 38 years, in one form or another he's always been saying\n\n31:39.640 --> 31:43.680\nsomeone pay attention to me and then that birther thing started happening, it's an opportunistic\n\n31:43.680 --> 31:44.680\ninfection.\n\n31:44.680 --> 31:49.960\nIt's like a gaping wound on your arm as a country, as we all are worldwide, like the\n\n31:49.960 --> 31:55.320\neconomy is like, we're in vulnerable places and so it's happening, this sentiment, it's\n\n31:55.320 --> 32:00.440\nlike, oh, I don't want these people with the towels and these things with the browns and\n\n32:00.440 --> 32:04.960\nthen they're taking the jarbs and then they're thinking, the tax is in the things and why\n\n32:04.960 --> 32:08.280\ncan't we have more guns and they want to wall around the thing and they put the wall and\n\n32:08.280 --> 32:11.120\nthey can do it and they're like, I can't do this.\n\n32:11.120 --> 32:16.200\nIt's starting, it's like those rumbles of like, it's going to turn into, it could turn\n\n32:16.200 --> 32:25.440\ninto ugliness, could turn into ugliness, but what was it, wait, wait, wait, oh, here's\n\n32:25.440 --> 32:29.960\nthe thing, this is the thing that terrified me when I was putting on my pants today.\n\n32:29.960 --> 32:33.120\nMy dick is huge!\n\n32:33.120 --> 32:37.440\nI was thinking, and this is going to sound like a bit, but it's like, as far as the ratio\n\n32:37.440 --> 32:42.600\nbetween how much like a bit it sounds and how actually scary I think it is, it's like,\n\n32:42.600 --> 32:45.680\nI've never said anything with this high a ratio.\n\n32:45.680 --> 32:52.480\nI'm not even sure how to phrase the question.\n\n32:52.480 --> 33:01.840\nWhat percentage of Hitler being able to come into power, what percentage of it do you think\n\n33:01.840 --> 33:10.880\nmight have been your average like, like kind of on the bubble, like constantly putting\n\n33:10.880 --> 33:18.960\nhis foot in his mouth, straight, white like Jim Belushi, Dan Harmon kind of like, like,\n\n33:18.960 --> 33:22.240\nlike, like, like, like, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, I was always offended, like, because\n\n33:22.240 --> 33:25.560\nI was just thinking, I just found myself thinking while I was putting on my pants, I just like,\n\n33:25.560 --> 33:28.740\nheard something else that Trump said, or I was thinking about that start, David's thinking,\n\n33:28.740 --> 33:31.580\nI was like, the thought went through my head of like,\n\n33:31.580 --> 33:36.420\nwell, it's good to know I'm not as racist as somebody.\n\n33:36.420 --> 33:41.100\nYou know, it's good to know I'm not the biggest\n\n33:41.100 --> 33:42.900\nfucking doofus in the world.\n\n33:42.900 --> 33:47.100\nAnd I was like, I'm back, in the 90s,\n\n33:47.100 --> 33:49.540\nbeing feminist, for instance, was as easy\n\n33:49.540 --> 33:51.740\nas expecting more from women.\n\n33:51.740 --> 33:57.700\nIt changed over the years.\n\n33:57.700 --> 34:01.340\nIt was like, you're like, you go, girl.\n\n34:01.340 --> 34:05.180\nThat was like a fucking, you were like, yeah, you can do it.\n\n34:05.180 --> 34:08.940\nIt was like, things change, and then you get like,\n\n34:08.940 --> 34:13.300\nso I wonder how many people are like,\n\n34:13.300 --> 34:15.780\nwith the Trump phenomenon, I wonder if that was something\n\n34:15.780 --> 34:19.660\nthat could happen in Germany, like, back in those days\n\n34:19.660 --> 34:22.180\nwhere people were like, oh, finally, somebody\n\n34:22.180 --> 34:24.220\nthat makes me sound like I like Jews.\n\n34:29.220 --> 34:31.300\nLike, finally, my daughter will stop\n\n34:31.300 --> 34:34.900\nrolling her eyes at everything I say at the dinner table.\n\n34:34.900 --> 34:38.220\nYou know, like, and I was like, I had this shutter.\n\n34:38.220 --> 34:40.420\nI was like, wait, is that the fucking tyranny?\n\n34:40.420 --> 34:41.260\nIs that what it is?\n\n34:41.260 --> 34:45.060\nIs that what, is that the wildfire that catches fire\n\n34:45.060 --> 34:46.660\nand burns up King's Landing?\n\n34:46.660 --> 34:50.340\nLike, is that the, it's the actual, just like,\n\n34:50.340 --> 34:54.380\nit's the oxygen, it's the styrofoam peanuts,\n\n34:54.380 --> 34:57.620\nit's the shit that coats the film in Glorious Basterds,\n\n34:57.620 --> 35:01.980\nit's the actual accelerant, isn't like the fucking like,\n\n35:01.980 --> 35:05.940\nhard, it takes work to be a fucking redneck stump hump\n\n35:05.940 --> 35:08.580\nand fucking like, active like, racist,\n\n35:08.580 --> 35:11.500\nor you're like, I'm gonna hit you with a stick,\n\n35:11.500 --> 35:16.860\nyou see your color, like, geez, that guy is committed.\n\n35:16.860 --> 35:19.740\nThe like, like, like, what about the fucking mob\n\n35:19.740 --> 35:23.060\naround that person that's like, I know that's bad\n\n35:23.060 --> 35:25.180\nand I wanna be liked, I know that's bad\n\n35:25.180 --> 35:27.140\nand I don't wanna be a bad person, I don't know.\n\n35:27.140 --> 35:29.700\nLike, like, like, what is the phenomenon that might,\n\n35:29.700 --> 35:31.820\nyou know, like, we have to be on guard against that\n\n35:31.820 --> 35:34.060\nbecause like, I just like, feel that in my soul,\n\n35:34.060 --> 35:35.900\nlike, there's these things eating away at the edges\n\n35:35.900 --> 35:38.740\nwhere I'm like, why am I trying so hard?\n\n35:38.740 --> 35:40.220\nWhy, why do I try?\n\n35:40.220 --> 35:42.380\nWhy, well, they're like, like, like, like, you know,\n\n35:42.380 --> 35:44.140\nand it's like, there's important answers\n\n35:44.140 --> 35:47.420\nto those questions we all have to ask.\n\n35:47.420 --> 35:50.380\nSo when you put on your pants next time,\n\n35:50.380 --> 35:52.500\nplease join me at these heights of thought.\n\n35:54.500 --> 35:55.980\nJust asking the specific questions,\n\n35:55.980 --> 35:57.260\nI wanna recap the question.\n\n35:57.260 --> 36:01.060\nHow many people in pre-Nazi Germany do you think\n\n36:01.060 --> 36:05.500\nwere a little bit like, that became Hitler supporters,\n\n36:05.500 --> 36:08.420\nwere anti-Hitler in their conversation,\n\n36:08.420 --> 36:11.740\nbut then in some weird, Poloric Valve part of them\n\n36:11.740 --> 36:16.740\nwere like, they were like, oh, that guy's a goofball,\n\n36:16.740 --> 36:18.820\nhe'll take all the pressure off me.\n\n36:18.820 --> 36:19.660\nYou know, like.\n\n36:19.660 --> 36:22.340\nAt that time, there was a lot of parties vying for power\n\n36:22.340 --> 36:24.260\nand the Weimar Republic was falling to pieces\n\n36:24.260 --> 36:25.100\nand there was always provisions.\n\n36:25.100 --> 36:26.660\nThere was so many parties vying for power\n\n36:26.660 --> 36:29.100\nthat they had to call it the Weimar Republic.\n\n36:30.180 --> 36:32.140\nCause they were like, vying is like, all right,\n\n36:32.140 --> 36:33.500\nkeep going, I'm sorry.\n\n36:33.500 --> 36:35.140\nSchrab hasn't been here and they're like,\n\n36:35.140 --> 36:39.540\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n\n36:39.540 --> 36:43.900\nBut there was a bunch of asshole, meathead, bully thugs\n\n36:43.900 --> 36:45.460\nthat were running around with brown shirts on\n\n36:45.460 --> 36:48.180\nand kicking everybody's ass and blaming the economy,\n\n36:48.180 --> 36:49.860\ncause the economy was fucked.\n\n36:49.860 --> 36:51.780\nThere was this giant depression going on\n\n36:51.780 --> 36:54.020\nand they're blaming it all on foreigners,\n\n36:54.020 --> 36:56.060\nwhich is what you see going on in all of Europe,\n\n36:56.060 --> 37:00.340\nalso here, and then at some point,\n\n37:00.340 --> 37:04.740\nI think like, when this certain really radical party\n\n37:04.740 --> 37:06.660\nstarts saying like, we'll kick your ass\n\n37:06.660 --> 37:08.860\nif you don't agree with us that Jews are the problem\n\n37:08.860 --> 37:12.100\nand all this shit and like really extreme stuff.\n\n37:12.100 --> 37:13.100\nI think a lot of people are like, look,\n\n37:13.100 --> 37:15.980\nI would just like the economy to get back on track\n\n37:15.980 --> 37:18.980\nand we'll start following anybody that really has answers\n\n37:18.980 --> 37:22.220\nto getting the economy going, which is all baloney.\n\n37:22.220 --> 37:23.740\nIt's all complete bullshit.\n\n37:23.740 --> 37:27.980\nIt's not as simple as immigration or leaving the EU.\n\n37:27.980 --> 37:30.420\nIt's like, it's crazy talk.\n\n37:30.420 --> 37:32.900\nBut I think that people want simple answers\n\n37:32.900 --> 37:36.540\nwhen the economy is fucked and they're working class people\n\n37:36.540 --> 37:39.020\nand they will listen to Lunatic billionaires\n\n37:39.020 --> 37:40.580\nwho say like, I'm on your side.\n\n37:40.580 --> 37:42.140\nThey're not fucking on your side.\n\n37:42.140 --> 37:43.300\nThey have nothing to do with you.\n\n37:43.300 --> 37:44.740\nThey don't even know who you are.\n\n37:44.740 --> 37:45.740\nAlso, everything they're saying,\n\n37:45.740 --> 37:47.260\nit makes no sense at all.\n\n37:48.900 --> 37:53.900\nThe answer is, will average people start becoming okay\n\n37:54.180 --> 37:55.500\nwith radical ideas?\n\n37:55.500 --> 37:58.380\nYes, absolutely they do.\n\n37:58.380 --> 38:00.900\nAnd what's happening all over the world right now\n\n38:00.900 --> 38:04.300\nin major democracies, including ours,\n\n38:04.300 --> 38:06.180\nand all over like France and England,\n\n38:06.180 --> 38:10.940\nlike fascism, right wing extremism, racism is on the rise.\n\n38:10.940 --> 38:12.780\nAnd it's gaining footholds.\n\n38:12.780 --> 38:15.780\nAnd that's the places that are collapsing first.\n\n38:15.780 --> 38:16.740\nThe banks are closing,\n\n38:16.740 --> 38:19.740\nwell then there's a swastika like five feet from there,\n\n38:19.740 --> 38:21.100\nyou know, like in Greece and stuff.\n\n38:21.100 --> 38:24.380\nLike the national socialism is, yeah.\n\n38:24.380 --> 38:27.460\nThe average person in Germany didn't hate Jews,\n\n38:27.460 --> 38:29.380\nbut the average person was okay with like,\n\n38:29.380 --> 38:31.140\nkind of going along with the flow.\n\n38:31.140 --> 38:35.260\nAnd also like, Germany is a huge country,\n\n38:35.260 --> 38:37.260\nfull of different neighbors that believed\n\n38:37.260 --> 38:39.580\nin different things, followed different parties.\n\n38:39.580 --> 38:41.900\nAlso at some point, fear comes into it.\n\n38:41.900 --> 38:44.860\nThe idea that speaking up for what you believe\n\n38:44.860 --> 38:46.740\nactually becomes illegal.\n\n38:46.740 --> 38:49.180\nAnd that's the scary thing is that right now,\n\n38:49.180 --> 38:52.540\nwe're still like, we can still talk shit about Trump\n\n38:52.540 --> 38:56.020\nand talk shit about what like the direction things are going\n\n38:56.020 --> 38:57.780\nand it can still be comedy.\n\n38:57.780 --> 39:00.860\nThat might go away before too long.\n\n39:00.860 --> 39:03.260\nLike that's the real danger is that it's actually illegal.\n\n39:03.260 --> 39:04.260\nCertainly if you're out in the fringe\n\n39:04.260 --> 39:07.540\nand you're for instance, I don't know if that lady\n\n39:07.540 --> 39:10.020\nwho was painting Trump with a little dick or whatever\n\n39:10.020 --> 39:12.340\nand some guy runs up and smacks him in the face.\n\n39:12.340 --> 39:15.860\nYeah, I mean, it's like, yeah, it was like,\n\n39:15.860 --> 39:19.820\nso what's the takeaway?\n\n39:19.820 --> 39:21.780\nI think it's that in the coming years,\n\n39:21.780 --> 39:24.220\nI don't think that Trump is going to get elected,\n\n39:24.220 --> 39:25.260\nbut I think-\n\n39:25.260 --> 39:27.460\nI don't think that you should be that comfortable saying that.\n\n39:27.460 --> 39:29.540\nI think it's very, very likely.\n\n39:29.540 --> 39:30.380\nJesus Christ.\n\n39:30.380 --> 39:31.780\nWell, okay, put a pin in that.\n\n39:31.780 --> 39:34.260\nPeople hate Hillary so much for whatever their reasons\n\n39:34.260 --> 39:35.300\nare right or wrong.\n\n39:35.300 --> 39:39.020\nPeople despise her and will vote against somebody\n\n39:39.020 --> 39:41.140\nfor whatever they believe about her.\n\n39:41.140 --> 39:45.980\nAnd they will also vote for this incredible quack.\n\n39:45.980 --> 39:47.060\nThey will vote for him.\n\n39:47.060 --> 39:48.980\nWell, I think the easy thing to say though\n\n39:48.980 --> 39:53.060\nis disregard what you think the results of the election\n\n39:53.060 --> 39:56.060\nmight be because in either case,\n\n39:56.060 --> 39:59.140\nlike what's clear from this process,\n\n39:59.140 --> 40:04.140\nlike this fat orange manic bullet that shot\n\n40:04.180 --> 40:07.620\nor like squirted out of a volcano,\n\n40:07.620 --> 40:11.700\nlike it represents magma underneath\n\n40:11.700 --> 40:15.940\nand it's not, well, this is where my lack\n\n40:15.940 --> 40:19.020\nof a geology degree will probably break this metaphor down,\n\n40:19.020 --> 40:26.020\nbut it doesn't mean, oh, look at that really scary volcano\n\n40:26.180 --> 40:27.500\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n40:27.500 --> 40:29.140\nOh, it seems to have gone dormant.\n\n40:29.140 --> 40:31.100\nLike that's why I keep,\n\n40:31.100 --> 40:32.700\nthat's why I really want people to understand,\n\n40:32.700 --> 40:37.420\nlike it starts with hero worship in politics.\n\n40:37.420 --> 40:40.220\nIt starts with this idea that we're waiting for somebody\n\n40:40.220 --> 40:42.700\nto lead us or say the right things\n\n40:42.700 --> 40:46.100\nor the president's office is so important and valuable\n\n40:46.100 --> 40:47.260\nand it changes so much\n\n40:47.260 --> 40:48.820\nand that's why we need the right person at office.\n\n40:48.820 --> 40:53.820\nAnd that really noble thought ends somewhere\n\n40:54.540 --> 40:57.260\nwith like somehow you're making a pact with the devil\n\n40:57.260 --> 40:59.300\nwhere you're like, well, I'm not worth anything\n\n40:59.300 --> 41:00.940\nand I can't do anything and all this stuff.\n\n41:00.940 --> 41:02.940\nAnd then we're in this really dangerous time\n\n41:02.940 --> 41:04.420\nwhere we finally, for the first time,\n\n41:04.420 --> 41:05.420\nwe've gotten this voice,\n\n41:05.420 --> 41:07.460\nlike this first generation to be raised\n\n41:07.460 --> 41:10.180\nin front of a keyboard with a blinking cursor in front of it.\n\n41:10.180 --> 41:11.660\nThey've mastered the hashtag\n\n41:11.660 --> 41:14.580\nand the linguistic acrobatics that represent\n\n41:14.580 --> 41:17.060\nlike not getting all fucking bent out of shape\n\n41:17.060 --> 41:18.860\nwhen a girl says she just wants to be friends.\n\n41:18.860 --> 41:22.580\nLike they're advancing the species like by leaps and bounds\n\n41:22.580 --> 41:26.460\nbecause they're able to interface with machines\n\n41:26.460 --> 41:30.380\nand psychologically keep a lid on shit.\n\n41:30.380 --> 41:32.820\nHowever, like the scary thing about that\n\n41:32.820 --> 41:34.580\nis that now we're all just like,\n\n41:34.580 --> 41:37.060\nwe're like talking and we're talking and we're talking\n\n41:37.060 --> 41:38.940\nabout what's right and what's wrong.\n\n41:38.940 --> 41:42.620\nAnd I hope we don't tailspin until like,\n\n41:42.620 --> 41:44.740\noh man, did you see that racist TV show last night?\n\n41:44.740 --> 41:45.700\nYeah, that was so racist.\n\n41:45.700 --> 41:46.540\nDid you hashtag it?\n\n41:46.540 --> 41:47.660\nYeah, I did.\n\n41:47.660 --> 41:49.620\nWell, this shit continues to happen,\n\n41:49.620 --> 41:52.060\nbut it's like push may come to shove at a certain point.\n\n41:52.060 --> 41:53.740\nAnd it may not be the people that are saying\n\n41:53.740 --> 41:57.060\nthe most eloquent, most progressive sounding things,\n\n41:57.060 --> 41:59.780\nthat are the people who, at the bottom line of it all,\n\n41:59.780 --> 42:01.860\nare just people who want the power\n\n42:01.860 --> 42:02.940\nto leave the hands of the few\n\n42:02.940 --> 42:04.460\nand go into the hands of the many,\n\n42:04.460 --> 42:08.980\nwho you may have to fight fucking fascism with anarchy.\n\n42:08.980 --> 42:10.420\nI don't know what else you fight it with.\n\n42:10.420 --> 42:12.420\nI put water on a fire myself.\n\n42:12.420 --> 42:16.380\nLike, and the fact that anarchy to us means explosions\n\n42:16.380 --> 42:19.340\nand chaos is part of a 70 year indoctrination\n\n42:19.340 --> 42:20.380\nthat started with like,\n\n42:20.380 --> 42:22.620\nlet's make that word mean terrorism, it doesn't.\n\n42:22.620 --> 42:23.700\nIt means no hierarchy.\n\n42:23.700 --> 42:25.900\nIt means nobody has a right to tell you what to do.\n\n42:25.900 --> 42:29.540\nSo like, you know, we may have to,\n\n42:30.900 --> 42:32.900\nit's always scary the spattering of applause\n\n42:32.900 --> 42:34.300\nbecause it means that like,\n\n42:34.300 --> 42:36.500\nwhat I hear is the silence between each.\n\n42:36.500 --> 42:40.460\nI was like, oh, Harmon like said something\n\n42:40.460 --> 42:42.100\nreally specific last night.\n\n42:42.100 --> 42:45.660\nI got that weird Chinese checkers applause.\n\n42:45.660 --> 42:48.140\nI was like, guys with bowler hats going,\n\n42:48.140 --> 42:51.540\nheard you loud and clear, blokey matey,\n\n42:51.540 --> 42:53.460\nmilky milky welly well.\n\n42:55.820 --> 42:58.020\nLike our low level anarchism,\n\n42:58.020 --> 42:59.900\nthe idea that we hate being told what to do,\n\n42:59.900 --> 43:03.140\nthat the absence of rule doesn't mean chaos.\n\n43:03.140 --> 43:03.980\nIt shouldn't mean that.\n\n43:03.980 --> 43:05.860\nNo, anarchy doesn't mean,\n\n43:05.860 --> 43:07.860\nno, it does not mean like stirring shit up.\n\n43:07.860 --> 43:09.980\nIt doesn't have to.\n\n43:09.980 --> 43:12.620\nAnarchy means you don't think you have a right\n\n43:12.620 --> 43:13.620\nto tell other people what to do.\n\n43:13.620 --> 43:15.700\nYou don't really respect the right to tell you what to do.\n\n43:15.700 --> 43:16.980\nYou don't really see that as a,\n\n43:16.980 --> 43:19.300\nyou may see that as a way to put out a fire\n\n43:19.300 --> 43:21.380\nor get health insurance or get shit done.\n\n43:21.380 --> 43:23.580\nYou know, like keep people from getting hurt\n\n43:23.580 --> 43:25.380\nin a crowd situation.\n\n43:25.380 --> 43:27.540\nBut it's not an inherent need.\n\n43:27.540 --> 43:30.020\nYou don't believe that people are these animals\n\n43:30.020 --> 43:31.260\nthat left to their own devices\n\n43:31.260 --> 43:32.740\nare gonna like start running around\n\n43:32.740 --> 43:35.100\nand doing fucked up shit unless there's an elite class\n\n43:35.100 --> 43:37.020\nthat pays themselves to do nothing\n\n43:37.020 --> 43:40.260\nbut think about how we should be mitigated.\n\n43:40.260 --> 43:43.180\nIt's, you just think that shit works the way it works.\n\n43:43.180 --> 43:45.460\nAnd the idea that right now, like,\n\n43:45.460 --> 43:47.940\nwhether you like Hillary or you hate Trump\n\n43:47.940 --> 43:50.460\nor like Trump or hate, whatever the fuck you think,\n\n43:50.460 --> 43:51.380\nor if you're a Bernie supporter\n\n43:51.380 --> 43:52.820\nand you're all disappointed about that,\n\n43:52.820 --> 43:55.340\nthe idea that one human being is going to come along\n\n43:55.340 --> 43:58.020\nand make everything okay is crazy.\n\n43:58.020 --> 44:01.020\nIt's really adolescent and really dumb.\n\n44:01.020 --> 44:02.860\nThe idea that we need leadership\n\n44:02.860 --> 44:04.860\nfrom one person holding one office\n\n44:04.860 --> 44:06.780\nthat used to be a shit fucking gig,\n\n44:06.780 --> 44:10.060\na low paid crap clerical gig\n\n44:10.060 --> 44:12.780\nin our constitutional government.\n\n44:12.780 --> 44:14.180\nIt's really crazy, but right now,\n\n44:14.180 --> 44:16.940\nwouldn't we be really happy if anybody came along\n\n44:16.940 --> 44:19.420\nthat could put a thoughtful sentence together\n\n44:19.420 --> 44:22.260\nand not irritate us?\n\n44:22.260 --> 44:24.260\nThat's the danger of what's going on right now\n\n44:24.260 --> 44:26.860\nwith this, it's gonna be Hillary and Trump.\n\n44:26.860 --> 44:27.780\nAnd we're gonna just go like,\n\n44:27.780 --> 44:29.260\noh, I just wish somebody could talk\n\n44:29.260 --> 44:32.940\nand I would like to hear them finish the goddamn thought.\n\n44:32.940 --> 44:34.460\nAnd that's horrifying.\n\n44:34.460 --> 44:37.500\nWe shouldn't care about one person's fucking ideas.\n\n44:37.500 --> 44:42.300\nThere should be a gigantic consortium of people\n\n44:42.300 --> 44:43.140\ngetting together.\n\n44:43.140 --> 44:45.420\nCommunity should fucking operate together.\n\n44:45.420 --> 44:46.740\nFamily should operate together.\n\n44:46.740 --> 44:48.060\nBut we have the tools to do it right now\n\n44:48.060 --> 44:50.380\nand this is a generation that's actively,\n\n44:50.380 --> 44:52.020\nlike they're figuring out how to do that stuff.\n\n44:52.020 --> 44:54.260\nAnd I think that the next step,\n\n44:54.260 --> 44:56.620\nmaybe it's not even thinking of waiting\n\n44:56.620 --> 44:59.460\nfor some profit to arise and like switch things.\n\n44:59.460 --> 45:00.780\nIt's like, it actually is just like,\n\n45:00.780 --> 45:02.380\noh shit, we got these apps.\n\n45:02.380 --> 45:04.180\nWe got this internet, we got it going.\n\n45:04.180 --> 45:06.340\nWe can think and act locally\n\n45:06.340 --> 45:08.700\nand we can give unto Caesar what is Caesar's.\n\n45:08.700 --> 45:10.740\nLike because like, like just,\n\n45:10.740 --> 45:12.700\ninstead of just letting the,\n\n45:12.700 --> 45:13.540\nwe just came off this thing.\n\n45:13.540 --> 45:14.460\nI think all we're doing right now\n\n45:14.460 --> 45:16.220\nis voting for the next best Caesar.\n\n45:16.220 --> 45:17.660\nLike everybody is like.\n\n45:17.660 --> 45:19.460\nI know, but we don't, we could,\n\n45:19.460 --> 45:20.700\nthere are some people in this audience\n\n45:20.700 --> 45:22.260\nthat watch The Voice and American Idol,\n\n45:22.260 --> 45:24.100\nbut they also watched Community.\n\n45:24.100 --> 45:25.380\nYou know, like they can.\n\n45:25.380 --> 45:29.340\nThat's not true.\n\n45:31.020 --> 45:32.340\nIt means that you can say,\n\n45:32.340 --> 45:34.140\nlike when I'm interested in who's gonna\n\n45:34.140 --> 45:36.540\nbe the best singer in this season\n\n45:36.540 --> 45:37.900\nof the best singer show,\n\n45:37.900 --> 45:40.460\nI don't necessarily have to let that thought process\n\n45:40.460 --> 45:42.300\ntrickle down into how I pass the salt\n\n45:42.300 --> 45:43.780\nto my friend over dinner.\n\n45:43.780 --> 45:45.260\nI don't have to, when they go,\n\n45:45.260 --> 45:46.100\ncould you pass me the salt?\n\n45:46.100 --> 45:46.940\nI go, I don't know.\n\n45:46.940 --> 45:49.860\nHow good are you at asking for passing the salt?\n\n45:49.860 --> 45:51.540\nLet's, you know, those glasses\n\n45:51.540 --> 45:52.500\nlike don't look good on you.\n\n45:52.500 --> 45:54.060\nI think that smart look is stupid.\n\n45:54.060 --> 45:56.420\nWhy don't you take them off and ask for the salt?\n\n45:56.420 --> 45:58.220\nAll right, now, now give me a high C.\n\n45:58.220 --> 45:59.660\nI'd like the salt there.\n\n45:59.660 --> 46:01.740\nNow that's what I'm talking about.\n\n46:01.740 --> 46:02.900\nNow you've earned my salt\n\n46:02.900 --> 46:04.460\nbecause I watch American Idol.\n\n46:04.460 --> 46:05.940\nLike, no, you can watch American Idol\n\n46:05.940 --> 46:07.620\nand you can go, that's for that.\n\n46:07.620 --> 46:09.060\nYou can elect a president and go,\n\n46:09.060 --> 46:11.700\nthat's a person that if a Supreme Court justice dies,\n\n46:11.700 --> 46:14.020\nthey have the power to like, no, you know,\n\n46:14.020 --> 46:16.660\nlike there are certain things that like are important\n\n46:16.660 --> 46:18.340\nthat we're voting for these people for,\n\n46:18.340 --> 46:20.060\nbut it doesn't have to anything to do with like,\n\n46:20.060 --> 46:21.540\nwhether your street has potholes on it\n\n46:21.540 --> 46:23.060\nand all that shit.\n\n46:23.060 --> 46:24.460\nMe, I'm old and I'm busy.\n\n46:24.460 --> 46:25.380\nSo good luck.\n\n46:25.380 --> 46:29.140\nBut, but I do think, I mean, yeah, I mean,\n\n46:29.140 --> 46:31.540\nit's like, like what if we did enter an age\n\n46:31.540 --> 46:33.740\nwhen we were just voting for the least offensive person?\n\n46:33.740 --> 46:35.020\nWhat if that was their job?\n\n46:35.020 --> 46:36.740\nYou know, and they didn't, you know,\n\n46:36.740 --> 46:39.660\nand then like, what if you built like from the ground up?\n\n46:39.660 --> 46:41.380\nLike you built like the sort of like,\n\n46:41.380 --> 46:43.500\nthere was a word for it and there was a phrase for it.\n\n46:43.500 --> 46:45.820\nAnd it was anarchy because it didn't have leadership\n\n46:45.820 --> 46:46.660\nbecause it didn't need it\n\n46:46.660 --> 46:48.380\nbecause it did take advantage of technology\n\n46:48.380 --> 46:50.540\nfaster than these people at the top could.\n\n46:50.540 --> 46:53.020\nAnd so that they found themselves\n\n46:53.020 --> 46:55.260\nin the most powerful position of the world,\n\n46:55.260 --> 46:58.140\nbut it was in charge of a fucking slab of marble\n\n46:58.140 --> 47:00.060\nthat couldn't be cracked, couldn't be lifted\n\n47:00.060 --> 47:00.980\nand couldn't be moved.\n\n47:00.980 --> 47:02.540\nAnd they're like, I'm on top of it,\n\n47:02.540 --> 47:03.940\nkind of lonely up here.\n\n47:03.940 --> 47:06.420\nAnd Wendy, I get to jump off in four years\n\n47:06.420 --> 47:08.260\nor stay on for another four.\n\n47:08.260 --> 47:10.860\nAnd the people that don't fuck up get to stay up there.\n\n47:10.860 --> 47:13.300\nAnd we're down here going like, we figured it out.\n\n47:13.300 --> 47:17.300\nWe are, it has to do with on a molecular level going like,\n\n47:17.300 --> 47:19.300\nI think our biggest challenge right now is\n\n47:19.300 --> 47:22.020\nwe've been so stoked about how much cleaning needs\n\n47:22.020 --> 47:23.540\nto be done around the apartment\n\n47:23.540 --> 47:25.460\nthat you ever get on one of those tantrums\n\n47:25.460 --> 47:28.220\nwhere you're like, you're like, fuck off this shit,\n\n47:28.220 --> 47:31.100\nfuck it, shit, you're just throwing away like,\n\n47:31.100 --> 47:35.380\nBibles and like, new pens and money.\n\n47:35.380 --> 47:37.740\nLike I'm gonna take like fistful of pennies\n\n47:37.740 --> 47:38.900\nand you're like, fucking pennies,\n\n47:38.900 --> 47:40.460\nyou're going to have fucking pennies.\n\n47:40.460 --> 47:43.020\nLike when you're like cleaning your office or whatever\n\n47:43.020 --> 47:44.340\nand you're like, fucking like,\n\n47:44.340 --> 47:46.500\nit just brings like this rage out in you\n\n47:46.500 --> 47:47.940\nthat is like against clutter.\n\n47:47.940 --> 47:50.260\nAnd you're like, I want to simplify my life.\n\n47:50.260 --> 47:52.500\nI think that's, we've hit the peak of that\n\n47:52.500 --> 47:54.100\nwith the whole woke kind of thing.\n\n47:54.100 --> 47:55.740\nLike where we're calling out racism,\n\n47:55.740 --> 47:57.020\nwe're calling out negative thought,\n\n47:57.020 --> 47:59.300\nwe're exposing like, we're like,\n\n47:59.300 --> 48:00.940\nwhat the fuck has this person ever done for me?\n\n48:00.940 --> 48:02.780\nAh, another person that turns out to hate women.\n\n48:02.780 --> 48:03.860\nNo big surprise.\n\n48:03.860 --> 48:05.580\nAnd it's like, and everything has to go\n\n48:05.580 --> 48:06.540\nin the garbage right now\n\n48:06.540 --> 48:08.740\nbecause we're like cleaning out our space.\n\n48:08.740 --> 48:11.980\nBut like, we are gonna have to get to a point\n\n48:11.980 --> 48:14.220\nwhere if that space is gonna be of any use,\n\n48:14.220 --> 48:15.420\nwe're gonna have to be like,\n\n48:15.420 --> 48:17.100\nwell, not everything that goes in this room\n\n48:17.100 --> 48:20.060\nneeds to be the Mona Lisa because this isn't a museum.\n\n48:20.060 --> 48:22.660\nThis is an office or a living room or a parlor.\n\n48:22.660 --> 48:26.700\nYou know, like my friend has some regressive thoughts\n\n48:26.700 --> 48:28.220\nabout women.\n\n48:28.220 --> 48:31.540\nHe hasn't scratched that off on his bingo card yet.\n\n48:31.540 --> 48:35.340\nHe's really, really like super amazing about race.\n\n48:35.340 --> 48:38.260\nHe really hates women.\n\n48:38.260 --> 48:39.740\nLike I'm not gonna like,\n\n48:39.740 --> 48:43.220\nlike just record him over lunch\n\n48:43.220 --> 48:47.340\nand then post it on Facebook and expose him as a thing.\n\n48:47.340 --> 48:48.740\nLike I'm going to,\n\n48:48.740 --> 48:51.340\nI'm gonna like actually like work with him\n\n48:51.340 --> 48:56.180\nand like, you know, like kind of polish him\n\n48:56.180 --> 48:58.980\nlike a stone, like like with my water, you know?\n\n49:00.380 --> 49:04.420\nI'm gonna, and strangers that I find out are regressive.\n\n49:04.420 --> 49:07.140\nI'm ignorant because they haven't talked to\n\n49:07.140 --> 49:09.340\nas many people that look like me yet.\n\n49:09.340 --> 49:13.100\nI'm going to, I'm gonna do something really difficult\n\n49:13.100 --> 49:16.740\nwhich is like, I'm just gonna like have to be this billboard\n\n49:16.740 --> 49:19.660\nfor people that this person has never talked to\n\n49:19.660 --> 49:21.700\nand I'm gonna make every experience a positive one\n\n49:21.700 --> 49:24.740\nor like, I don't know what the fucking definition is,\n\n49:24.740 --> 49:26.340\nbut it's like harder than,\n\n49:26.340 --> 49:29.620\nit's way, way harder than finger pointing and shaming\n\n49:29.620 --> 49:33.700\nand like, enchanting and like pushing down another pillar\n\n49:33.700 --> 49:36.100\nand watching another thing that was resting on it collapse.\n\n49:36.100 --> 49:38.900\nLike I think that we've got a good six months left of that\n\n49:38.900 --> 49:40.220\nbefore it gets like,\n\n49:40.220 --> 49:43.340\naren't we just, when the guy running with like,\n\n49:43.340 --> 49:46.540\none of the two people running is just like this turd person.\n\n49:46.540 --> 49:49.740\nLike he's just, he's not gonna do anything with that rubble.\n\n49:49.740 --> 49:51.940\nLike he's not gonna let go, thank you very much.\n\n49:51.940 --> 49:52.940\nAnd now I'm gonna take that\n\n49:52.940 --> 49:54.940\nand we're gonna build a big monument to women with it.\n\n49:54.940 --> 49:57.260\nLike he's not going, he's gonna go like,\n\n49:57.260 --> 49:59.260\nlet's make missiles with this rubble.\n\n50:00.740 --> 50:03.820\nIt's gonna be up to us,\n\n50:03.820 --> 50:07.100\nlike how we interior decorate the nation.\n\n50:07.100 --> 50:12.100\nIt, yeah, we should do it, we'll do it on the moon.\n\n50:14.020 --> 50:17.260\nI, I, I was, I was just gonna say that.\n\n50:17.260 --> 50:18.900\nLike after his cars kill,\n\n50:20.100 --> 50:21.460\nmaybe we can like merge with him\n\n50:21.460 --> 50:23.500\nand he'll like, if you give us a,\n\n50:23.500 --> 50:26.100\nright before you said to still on the moon,\n\n50:26.100 --> 50:29.540\nthe original like joke premise of, of this podcast was like,\n\n50:29.540 --> 50:31.380\nlike we'd like, let's find like-minded people\n\n50:31.380 --> 50:34.340\nand colonize another place and make things okay.\n\n50:34.340 --> 50:35.820\nLike we're gonna have to like,\n\n50:35.820 --> 50:40.020\nstart like making colonies of like-minded people here\n\n50:40.020 --> 50:42.420\nand actually let that become revolutionary.\n\n50:42.420 --> 50:44.380\nYou know where we're gonna start doing it, Jeff,\n\n50:44.380 --> 50:47.220\nwhere we pick the people that, that get to help us\n\n50:47.220 --> 50:49.460\nat the Comic-Con Harmontown show.\n\n50:49.460 --> 50:54.460\nOh shit. Wait, are you talking about the one July 22nd?\n\n50:57.540 --> 50:59.380\nAt the, what theater?\n\n50:59.380 --> 51:00.700\nAt the Balboa Theater?\n\n51:00.700 --> 51:02.060\nAt the Balboa Theater?\n\n51:02.060 --> 51:04.580\nThe one who apparently our ticket sales are so shit\n\n51:04.580 --> 51:07.740\nthat we have to shoehorn this into our own show?\n\n51:07.740 --> 51:11.260\nApparently the show that's got show runners so worried\n\n51:11.260 --> 51:13.340\nthat they're calling Steve Levy and saying,\n\n51:13.340 --> 51:14.740\nyou guys gotta sell tickets\n\n51:14.740 --> 51:17.220\nor we're gonna have to nix this whole thing.\n\n51:17.220 --> 51:18.060\nNot me show, right?\n\n51:18.060 --> 51:21.300\nNot show run, like the ones that run the shows having.\n\n51:21.300 --> 51:22.140\nWhat do they call them?\n\n51:22.140 --> 51:23.940\nStage Peoples, right?\n\n51:23.940 --> 51:24.780\nStage Peoples.\n\n51:24.780 --> 51:25.620\nStage Peoples.\n\n51:25.620 --> 51:26.460\nStage Peoples.\n\n51:26.460 --> 51:28.580\nOh yeah, big time.\n\n51:28.580 --> 51:29.820\nYou know what else happens?\n\n51:29.820 --> 51:31.820\nHow many seats is the Balboa Theater, Steve Levy?\n\n51:31.820 --> 51:32.820\nSo many.\n\n51:34.820 --> 51:35.660\nA thousand?\n\n51:35.660 --> 51:37.580\nOh, we can do a thousand on our fucking heads.\n\n51:37.580 --> 51:39.260\nI mean, we don't even have to,\n\n51:39.260 --> 51:42.460\nbut we aren't even doing not even a thousand.\n\n51:42.460 --> 51:45.260\nHow much, what's the ticket price at the Balboa Theater?\n\n51:45.260 --> 51:46.420\n$24.\n\n51:46.420 --> 51:47.780\n$24?\n\n51:47.780 --> 51:48.620\nOkay, fuck it.\n\n51:48.620 --> 51:49.460\nDon't go.\n\n51:49.460 --> 51:52.260\nThat's, that's too much.\n\n51:52.260 --> 51:53.100\nThat's a lot of money.\n\n51:53.100 --> 51:54.940\nThat's their problem.\n\n51:54.940 --> 51:57.780\nIt should be fucking, I would say 12 tops.\n\n51:57.780 --> 52:01.260\nI would say your $10 here is a little unfair.\n\n52:01.260 --> 52:03.660\nAnd I think you're getting ripped off a little bit\n\n52:04.740 --> 52:07.260\nto the tune of two to four dollars.\n\n52:08.700 --> 52:10.780\nI would call this a eight to six dollars.\n\n52:10.780 --> 52:12.900\nAlso, at Comic-Con here,\n\n52:12.900 --> 52:14.460\nSteve's shaking his head.\n\n52:14.460 --> 52:18.620\n$24, also, you have to be in San Diego,\n\n52:18.620 --> 52:21.100\nwhich is, you should have to get $24 back\n\n52:21.100 --> 52:22.700\njust for entering San Diego.\n\n52:22.700 --> 52:26.060\nThat, well, that is true.\n\n52:26.060 --> 52:26.900\nIt sucks.\n\n52:26.900 --> 52:28.220\nIt's a terrible, terrible city.\n\n52:28.220 --> 52:30.140\nWe're smart people, we can figure this out.\n\n52:30.140 --> 52:31.700\nHave you tried Mexican food in San Diego?\n\n52:31.700 --> 52:32.620\nYou think it would be great.\n\n52:32.620 --> 52:34.380\nIt's right by it.\n\n52:34.380 --> 52:36.380\nIt's right by Mexico.\n\n52:36.380 --> 52:38.860\nAnd you'd be fucked if you can get a fucking proper taco\n\n52:38.860 --> 52:40.060\nwithout leaving the tent.\n\n52:40.060 --> 52:42.660\nYou have to get out of San Diego to get Mexican food.\n\n52:42.660 --> 52:44.020\nYou'd be fucked.\n\n52:44.020 --> 52:45.060\nHuh?\n\n52:45.060 --> 52:46.260\nIf you'd try to get a taco.\n\n52:46.260 --> 52:47.100\nYeah.\n\n52:47.100 --> 52:48.100\nYou're going to the wrong places.\n\n52:48.100 --> 52:49.020\nYou're going to the wrong places.\n\n52:49.020 --> 52:50.660\nThere's one guy.\n\n52:50.660 --> 52:54.820\nLook, yes, I know the San Diego people here.\n\n52:54.820 --> 52:55.900\nWell, me after the show,\n\n52:55.900 --> 52:57.660\nyou tell me where to go get tacos,\n\n52:57.660 --> 53:00.460\nand I will tell you that it's not in San Diego.\n\n53:00.460 --> 53:02.260\nYou're just outside of town.\n\n53:03.180 --> 53:05.300\nYou have to get out, you have to go so,\n\n53:05.300 --> 53:06.780\nit's not a walk from Comic-Con.\n\n53:06.780 --> 53:09.500\nYou have to get into a car to get fucking food there.\n\n53:09.500 --> 53:11.380\nLet's find out, let's ask ourselves.\n\n53:11.380 --> 53:13.420\nI'm saying don't go to Comic-Con.\n\n53:13.420 --> 53:16.220\nDon't go to the Balboa Theater on July 22nd.\n\n53:17.340 --> 53:19.500\nI don't think you have the guts to prove me wrong.\n\n53:19.500 --> 53:20.340\nLet's...\n\n53:22.820 --> 53:23.660\nI guess there's that.\n\n53:23.660 --> 53:25.300\nI've been to your shittiest town.\n\n53:26.420 --> 53:29.700\nI would say let's figure out if this is a $10 show.\n\n53:29.700 --> 53:31.220\nJust every guy has a wallet chain on.\n\n53:31.220 --> 53:34.860\nWell, we'll give out free prizes at the Comic-Con.\n\n53:34.860 --> 53:37.420\nIf you're walking into an establishment\n\n53:37.420 --> 53:38.820\nand the bouncer has a wallet chain on,\n\n53:38.820 --> 53:40.620\nyou're in a terrible place.\n\n53:40.620 --> 53:43.340\nLet's figure out if this is...\n\n53:43.340 --> 53:44.940\nBarbed wire tattoos?\n\n53:44.940 --> 53:46.340\nNope, nope, nope.\n\n53:46.340 --> 53:48.460\nIf this is a $10 show.\n\n53:48.460 --> 53:49.620\nNo, no.\n\n53:49.620 --> 53:52.780\nThen we just need to figure out what a $12 show is,\n\n53:52.780 --> 53:55.540\nwhich is as easy as raising this one 20%\n\n53:55.540 --> 53:56.580\nin terms of quality,\n\n53:56.580 --> 53:58.500\nand then doubling that for San Diego.\n\n53:58.500 --> 53:59.820\nRight.\n\n53:59.820 --> 54:02.340\nThat's all I wanted to say for the last five hours.\n\n54:02.340 --> 54:03.180\nWhat's that?\n\n54:03.180 --> 54:04.020\nWe go for five hours.\n\n54:04.020 --> 54:06.020\nI don't think that increases the value of our show.\n\n54:06.020 --> 54:09.420\nI will have no respect for anybody\n\n54:09.420 --> 54:12.180\nthat pays to see our show in San Diego.\n\n54:12.180 --> 54:13.980\nI will be mad at everybody that comes there\n\n54:13.980 --> 54:18.580\nand has put down $24 in the Balboa Theater on July 22nd.\n\n54:20.900 --> 54:22.900\nAnd not just because Dan and I are gonna do\n\n54:22.900 --> 54:27.100\nan all-nude review to start the show.\n\n54:27.100 --> 54:29.020\nI'm saying it's not a reason to go see it.\n\n54:29.020 --> 54:30.820\nAnd we'd also be really mad\n\n54:30.820 --> 54:33.740\nif you made a website using Squarespace.\n\n54:36.220 --> 54:39.260\nEven though they use an intuitive design\n\n54:39.260 --> 54:41.140\nthat works across all platforms.\n\n54:41.140 --> 54:45.380\nAlso, maybe you live in LA, all you people here.\n\n54:45.380 --> 54:47.500\nMaybe driving down to San Diego,\n\n54:47.500 --> 54:49.340\ndon't listen to Audible.com.\n\n54:51.100 --> 54:53.420\nI don't care how reasonable the prices are\n\n54:53.420 --> 54:55.580\nto listen to your favorite novels online,\n\n54:55.580 --> 54:57.940\nor even if you get a free book with sign-up.\n\n55:00.780 --> 55:02.540\nAnd I don't care if you're wearing my undies,\n\n55:02.540 --> 55:03.940\nthe softest underwear.\n\n55:05.140 --> 55:06.460\nWell, who needs books anyway?\n\n55:06.460 --> 55:09.220\nWhen, you know, it's like all you people out there\n\n55:09.220 --> 55:11.780\nwith your stupid Warby Parker glasses.\n\n55:16.180 --> 55:17.940\nWhich we also don't want you to get.\n\n55:17.940 --> 55:20.180\nAnd when you get them,\n\n55:20.180 --> 55:24.460\ndon't use them to look at fullscreen.com's content.\n\n55:24.460 --> 55:28.060\nEven though it only costs as much as a cup of coffee.\n\n55:28.060 --> 55:29.380\nA cup of coffee.\n\n55:29.380 --> 55:30.740\nA giant coffee a month.\n\n55:30.740 --> 55:35.740\nYeah, for a month.\n\n55:36.660 --> 55:38.340\nBut I think the

pennies.\n\n57:48.780 --> 57:50.020\nDid you ever throw away pennies\n\n57:50.020 --> 57:51.860\nwhen you're cleaning your office or your room or something?\n\n57:51.860 --> 57:54.220\nI wouldn't be bothered to organize things.\n\n57:54.220 --> 57:55.300\nI just throw it all in a bag.\n\n57:55.300 --> 57:57.220\nYou ever throw away books?\n\n57:57.220 --> 57:59.220\nYeah, a couple of times.\n\n57:59.220 --> 58:00.060\nYou feel guilty, right?\n\n58:00.060 --> 58:01.900\nLike as you're like, it's like knowledge and it's like.\n\n58:01.900 --> 58:04.820\nYeah, especially if I like paid for them for school,\n\n58:04.820 --> 58:06.580\nI just like, but there's so much anger.\n\n58:06.580 --> 58:08.940\nWhat is that guilt we feel about throwing away books?\n\n58:08.940 --> 58:11.140\nI don't throw away books.\n\n58:11.140 --> 58:16.060\nWell, because I would feel too guilty about it.\n\n58:16.060 --> 58:17.580\nOkay, well, what is that guilt?\n\n58:17.580 --> 58:18.780\nWhat is it?\n\n58:18.780 --> 58:21.140\nSomebody put a lot of effort into a book, I think.\n\n58:21.140 --> 58:23.220\nI couldn't, even if I hate the book.\n\n58:23.220 --> 58:25.780\nWe don't treat it as the physical thing that it is.\n\n58:25.780 --> 58:28.540\nWe treat it as the ideas it represents.\n\n58:28.540 --> 58:30.260\nLike when you work in books,\n\n58:30.260 --> 58:31.820\nyou're like this fucking garbage\n\n58:31.820 --> 58:33.260\nand you're ripping covers off shit.\n\n58:33.260 --> 58:35.660\nIt's like a really weird harrowing experience.\n\n58:35.660 --> 58:38.540\nI'd assume it's a lot like working in the meat industry.\n\n58:38.540 --> 58:39.900\nYou know?\n\n58:39.900 --> 58:42.260\nWe're soon out of here just banging calves\n\n58:42.260 --> 58:44.260\nagainst walls and shit.\n\n58:44.260 --> 58:45.980\nYeah, look it up.\n\n58:45.980 --> 58:47.620\nIt could even be a subjective guilt\n\n58:47.620 --> 58:50.340\nthat's like the equivalent of throwing away a barbell.\n\n58:50.340 --> 58:52.020\nOr you're like, that you've never used.\n\n58:52.020 --> 58:54.460\nLike you're like, oh, am I really committing to throwing away\n\n58:54.460 --> 58:55.660\nthe barbell?\n\n58:55.660 --> 58:59.180\nAnd also the garbage man's going to be like, Jesus Christ.\n\n58:59.180 --> 59:01.180\nHe's all ripped.\n\n59:01.180 --> 59:02.260\nStand 11.\n\n59:02.260 --> 59:03.260\nStand 11.\n\n59:03.260 --> 59:04.260\nWoo!\n\n59:04.260 --> 59:05.260\nWoo!\n\n59:05.260 --> 59:06.260\nWoo!\n\n59:06.260 --> 59:07.260\nWoo!\n\n59:07.260 --> 59:08.260\nWoo!\n\n59:08.260 --> 59:09.260\nWoo!\n\n59:09.260 --> 59:10.260\nWoo!\n\n59:10.260 --> 59:11.260\nUh, Savannah?\n\n59:11.260 --> 59:12.260\nYeah, Savannah.\n\n59:12.260 --> 59:13.260\nLike the biome?\n\n59:13.260 --> 59:17.020\nYes, exactly like the biome, but with only one N.\n\n59:17.020 --> 59:18.860\nSo the biome, but with one N.\n\n59:18.860 --> 59:19.860\nSavannah.\n\n59:19.860 --> 59:20.860\nYeah.\n\n59:20.860 --> 59:26.580\nWhere apes supposedly started walking upright to see over the tall grass and then to free\n\n59:26.580 --> 59:28.260\ntheir hands for tool use.\n\n59:28.260 --> 59:30.660\nBut not true, the Savannah theory.\n\n59:30.660 --> 59:36.620\nWiped off the charts in 1995 by virtue of finding a new semi-human that had nutrients\n\n59:36.620 --> 59:41.300\nin its bones that could not have been the result of eating food on the Savannah.\n\n59:41.300 --> 59:43.660\nSo we're living in a world where we don't know where humans came from.\n\n59:43.660 --> 59:44.660\nAquatic ape.\n\n59:44.660 --> 59:45.660\nAll right.\n\n59:45.660 --> 59:52.260\nBut I'm sure it's a beautiful name.\n\n59:52.260 --> 59:53.260\nSo what do you think?\n\n59:53.260 --> 59:57.860\nYou're a big Harmontown fan and you're thinking like, when you apply your mind to how we\n\n59:57.860 --> 01:00:02.980\ncould get people to show up to the Balboa Theater on Friday, oh you didn't know I was\n\n01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.980\ngoing to twist it to that?\n\n01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:04.980\nNo, I didn't.\n\n01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:05.980\nOh, okay.\n\n01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:06.980\nWell, what did you think I was going to ask?\n\n01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:07.980\nI don't know.\n\n01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.980\nI thought maybe you had a theory or something.\n\n01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:09.980\nI didn't know.\n\n01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:14.460\nWell, what's your favorite aspect of Harmontown?\n\n01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:17.380\nThe prizes.\n\n01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.380\nThe cash giveaways.\n\n01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.700\nThe prizes and free alcohol.\n\n01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:21.700\nYeah.\n\n01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:22.700\nUh-oh.\n\n01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:23.700\nWhat do you want to drink?\n\n01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.700\nIs that what you're saying?\n\n01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:25.700\nNo, absolutely.\n\n01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.700\nI'm okay.\n\n01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:27.700\nI'm drinking.\n\n01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:28.700\nNo, but you know.\n\n01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.700\nHave a drink, Savannah.\n\n01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:33.740\nWhat's a thing, put it this way.\n\n01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:41.140\nSo say I'm like a businessman that bought Harmontown and I'm like, I want to make Harmontown,\n\n01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:46.980\nI'm going to give it to people, I'm going to do something like, I won't get specific,\n\n01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.900\nbut like you've been called in as like a Harmontown expert.\n\n01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:54.460\nLike all the other Harmontown listeners have been wiped out in some like pretzel factory\n\n01:00:54.460 --> 01:01:01.940\nexplosion or like during like dollar tours because they're frugal, they're practical,\n\n01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:03.700\nthey love sodium.\n\n01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:10.020\nMy demographic is stuff like polls don't lie.\n\n01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:12.020\nYou guys love pretzels.\n\n01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:16.940\nSo they're all wiped out and you're sort of like the person who's in charge of like representing\n\n01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.340\nthe demographic that is like, that listens to the show.\n\n01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:25.500\nAnd so some like suit is like hauling you in and going like, what's the deal with it?\n\n01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:29.580\nWhy don't I just get rid of it and what parts of it do I preserve?\n\n01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:30.580\nWhat's the point?\n\n01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:34.100\nAnd like what kind of things would you?\n\n01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:40.980\nWell, I'm sorry to all the other Harmontown fans who are gone, but I think they would\n\n01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:45.980\nprobably if they were still there, would like maybe some of Jane's alcohol merchandise\n\n01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:46.980\nfor Harmontown.\n\n01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.620\nI'll bring some.\n\n01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:50.980\nI have some at my house.\n\n01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:55.820\nWe could bring it to give away to the fans bottles like the problem is that that's highly\n\n01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:59.380\nillegal for like various federal reasons.\n\n01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:00.380\nSo figure that out.\n\n01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.380\nYes.\n\n01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.380\nYeah.\n\n01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.380\nHe's not allowed to license his own booze.\n\n01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.380\nOkay.\n\n01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:10.860\nUm, and maybe her, sorry, more free t-shirts, more free t-shirts, oh, I think we got a shit\n\n01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.860\nton of t-shirts.\n\n01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:12.860\nYeah.\n\n01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:17.020\nUm, an Instagram contest maybe if you want to get the young people, Instagram contest\n\n01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:18.540\nsnapchat, snapchat contest.\n\n01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:19.540\nHow does that work?\n\n01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.540\nHow does it?\n\n01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:24.020\nUm, will you just give them a time limit to submit things on whatever platform you're\n\n01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.940\ngoing to use for Snapchat if you create like a filter for your show?\n\n01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:31.260\nIt's five dollars for just the evening for just the area that you're doing it in.\n\n01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:32.260\nWhat?\n\n01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:33.260\nYeah, five dollars.\n\n01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:34.260\nYeah.\n\n01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.260\nDo that tonight.\n\n01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:37.260\nIt's the big old dick.\n\n01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:43.260\nWait, I, I didn't, I don't, you're in large month, bitch.\n\n01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.260\nYeah.\n\n01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:49.260\nHashtag Spencer's dick.\n\n01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:52.900\nHashtag, no, just, just, just large month.\n\n01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.420\nI actually don't understand.\n\n01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:56.740\nCan you, cause I want to understand.\n\n01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:57.900\nSo do you use Snapchat?\n\n01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:58.900\nI have.\n\n01:02:58.900 --> 01:02:59.900\nYes.\n\n01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:00.900\nOkay.\n\n01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:03.180\nSo on Snapchat there are the filters you can use that companies can create.\n\n01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.180\nYou can also create them for communities if you're not making any money off of it.\n\n01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:09.180\nAnd those are free if you get them approved and they meet the community guidelines, which\n\n01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:11.180\nI'm not sure if you're.\n\n01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:12.180\nNo, it will.\n\n01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.180\nIt's, it's great.\n\n01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.180\nI know a guy at Snapchat.\n\n01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:19.980\nYou're saying we can do like an exclusive Harmontown Snapchat thing that puts a dick\n\n01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:21.380\non your head or whatever.\n\n01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.380\nExactly.\n\n01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.260\nSo you would create the filter.\n\n01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.260\nIt's really easy to do.\n\n01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.860\nOh, and it only works in that geo-fenced area.\n\n01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:34.980\nAnd for 20,000 square feet you can do for like $5 for the day, you can, you can do it.\n\n01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:35.980\nAnd how does that also apply?\n\n01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:36.980\nSorry, I don't mean to cut you off.\n\n01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:37.980\nYou're a fountain of information.\n\n01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:44.740\nI'm like putting my thumb over you, but, but, but I also, is there something similar\n\n01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:46.140\nto do that with Instagram?\n\n01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.140\nLike a.\n\n01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.140\nFor Instagram it would be different.\n\n01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:51.100\nYou wouldn't necessarily do a filter, though someone could take it with their Snapchat,\n\n01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:54.220\ntake it with a filter and then upload that to Instagram because now Instagram doesn't\n\n01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.220\nhave a limit.\n\n01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:56.220\nYou don't just have to do square photos.\n\n01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.220\nYou can do that like.\n\n01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:58.220\nAll right.\n\n01:03:58.220 --> 01:03:59.220\nVertical ones.\n\n01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:00.220\nAnd then they could throw that on there.\n\n01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:01.220\nSo you could do it either way.\n\n01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:02.220\nI would say do it separately.\n\n01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.220\nIt's a little too much work.\n\n01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:04.220\nYou want something really quick.\n\n01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:08.540\nSo you would have them send it to you, like create like a Harmontown Snapchat account\n\n01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.860\nand then everyone would take photos and then send it on their story, but also send it to\n\n01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:15.660\nthe Snapchat account for Harmontown and you pick the favorite one, you could broadcast\n\n01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:16.660\nthem on the screen.\n\n01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:17.900\nYou could do a lot of different things with it.\n\n01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:19.740\nMaybe we could use one of those hashtags.\n\n01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:21.740\nYou could use a hashtag.\n\n01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:22.740\nAll right.\n\n01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.900\nSo how can I pervert this into a way to, because I don't, the only thing I need help with\n\n01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:31.780\nis getting people into the Balboa Theater on the 22nd.\n\n01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.660\nI'm saying don't come.\n\n01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.780\nThat's all we'll put on the Snapchat filter.\n\n01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.580\nAnyone in the area will know.\n\n01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:41.540\nWell, you could do it.\n\n01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:45.140\nSo they would only be able to use the filter if they were in that area and then if you'd\n\n01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.420\nhave to take a photo with the filter or they'd have to like, you know, tag themselves there.\n\n01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:51.660\nThey'd have to take a picture maybe with someone, you know, something that shows that they\n\n01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:54.460\nwere at the event or they just have to promote it themselves.\n\n01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:59.500\nOh, you're saying like, so people who, so people who, this is the age old thing of like,\n\n01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:04.180\nanyone who comes to this thing is eligible maybe for a thing that's like, at the top\n\n01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:07.620\nof that is like a big deal like, I'm going to, restaurants do that, like the habit when\n\n01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:11.620\nthey open something new, they'll like do that where you have to go and you take a photo\n\n01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:15.300\nwith their Snapchat filter and then they give you free swag with the habit on it, which\n\n01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.620\nis not like, maybe some people are really into the habit.\n\n01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:22.540\nSo you want to have it, but for other people who want Harmontown swag, they could take\n\n01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:25.780\na photo and then if there's evidence they do that, then you could get something free\n\n01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:27.980\nwhen they check and when they're ticket out there.\n\n01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:33.140\nWhat if, what if you and a friend, but I want this to be contingent on all thousand seats\n\n01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:34.140\nfilled.\n\n01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:38.860\nWe could give them free habit.\n\n01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:45.460\nThe prize is whatever, whatever the contest is, the prize is that then you, you and a\n\n01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:53.580\nfriend cause we want it to be just a technically an abduction, they, they come home with, with\n\n01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:59.620\nme and my friends on the, on the party bus that I booked to go back and then they come\n\n01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:06.340\nand they, they live in my house and, and they just come to work with me, but it's like the\n\n01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:11.740\nfine print is like, you're getting up at like seven AM sometimes and like, like my dogs\n\n01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:16.300\nare going to like, like, like, like, like Harvey will roll over and do a submissive\n\n01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.780\npee on you.\n\n01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:20.300\nLike I don't make breakfast.\n\n01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:22.580\nLike I, you'll be drinking Soylent.\n\n01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:23.580\nYeah.\n\n01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.100\nYou don't keep food in the house really.\n\n01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:28.860\nBut like you can stay in my, I have a guest room and then like, you could like, you could\n\n01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:33.220\njust come, you just come like, like, like, if I could put you in a backpack, I would\n\n01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:38.420\nlike, but like, you just like, or handcuff you to me and like you would just, I was just\n\n01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:43.700\nright Rick and Morty and you'd be there and like that would be thrilling for some people.\n\n01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:44.700\nYeah.\n\n01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:45.700\nI'm sure.\n\n01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:46.700\nYeah.\n\n01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:47.700\nI'm sure.\n\n01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.700\nYeah.\n\n01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.700\nEven the, even the chance at it might make a thousand people show up.\n\n01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:50.700\nYeah.\n\n01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:51.700\nBut maybe that's the contingency as I go.\n\n01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:52.700\nA thousand people didn't show up.\n\n01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:55.220\nSo the top prize is a t-shirt.\n\n01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.220\nThat sounds great.\n\n01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.220\nAll right.\n\n01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:02.340\nWe'll figure something like that out because that's what I, because I'm like, I don't,\n\n01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:06.100\nI don't do stuff when I go home at night, like sit on a bowl of ice cream or like, like\n\n01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:09.220\nlook at like, I don't have like a shoebox of Polaroids or anything.\n\n01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:13.740\nSo that's like a resource I have where I could just like, I could just like have a person.\n\n01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:17.940\nThis isn't an invitation to stalk me, but I'm just saying like, my life is compatible\n\n01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:20.220\nwith like just a person like walking around.\n\n01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:21.700\nThat's what Spencer and Steve Levy are.\n\n01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:25.740\nThey, they, they, they, they, they, we all cohabitate.\n\n01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.740\nYeah.\n\n01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:28.060\nLike we're just a family.\n\n01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:31.220\nSo maybe, maybe that's like a luxurious package.\n\n01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:32.980\nI think that's what we did for the AIDS thing.\n\n01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:33.980\nOh yeah.\n\n01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:37.300\nYeah, that like, for Rick and Morty, like they're going to come home.\n\n01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:38.300\nSorry.\n\n01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:39.300\nJeff did a thing.\n\n01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.300\nIt was great.\n\n01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:41.780\nI, I, I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:42.780\nAll right.\n\n01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:44.780\nRick and Morty did an AIDS thing.\n\n01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:45.780\nYeah.\n\n01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:48.820\nWhere you could like, the more you donate it, you are eligible for a thing where you, you\n\n01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:52.100\ndo a voice on Rick and Morty and then I think you hang out, but not, yeah, like maybe\n\n01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:53.100\nit'll be like.\n\n01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:54.100\nWe still got to do that, right?\n\n01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:55.100\nRight?\n\n01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:56.100\nYeah.\n\n01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.100\nYeah.\n\n01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.100\nYeah.\n\n01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:59.100\nYeah.\n\n01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.100\nYou can't, you can't.\n\n01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:04.740\nBut Dan, you were talking, you were talking about earlier about like hanging out in Comic\n\n01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:05.740\nCon is kind of a bummer.\n\n01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.900\nIt's, it would be fun to have like a little party space.\n\n01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.620\nWhat if we had, what if we had like a little, like our own little party?\n\n01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.820\nOh, we'll be hanging out at the Geek and Sundry Lounge.\n\n01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.500\nIs that right?\n\n01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:16.500\nYeah.\n\n01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.500\nJust go there.\n\n01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:18.500\nIt'll be fine.\n\n01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:22.500\nWhat are they going to do?\n\n01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.500\nAll right.\n\n01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.780\nSavannah, you want to see what this other guy has to say maybe?\n\n01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:28.780\nYeah, sure.\n\n01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:30.340\nYou're not afraid of a little competition.\n\n01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:31.340\nWhy don't you come up, sir?\n\n01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:32.340\nYou know who you are.\n\n01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.340\nHello, sir.\n\n01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:34.340\nAre you Luke?\n\n01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:35.340\nI'm Zach.\n\n01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:36.340\nZach.\n\n01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:37.340\nYeah.\n\n01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:38.340\nWait.\n\n01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:39.340\nDid you bring me the booze?\n\n01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:40.340\nNo.\n\n01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:41.340\nNo, that was Luke.\n\n01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.340\nHe looks like me though.\n\n01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:53.340\nThat was another, that was another guy that was bald with a beard.\n\n01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:54.860\nThere are many of us here tonight.\n\n01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:55.860\nOh yeah.\n\n01:08:55.860 --> 01:09:01.100\nI'm among my people and it's just, it's just, you know, it's to beat the heat.\n\n01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.940\nYou're not, you're not a neo-Nazi.\n\n01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:05.020\nI'm, no, I'm certainly not.\n\n01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:08.620\nHe's got one of those Hillary stars on his shirt.\n\n01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:12.460\nSorry, I didn't hear that.\n\n01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:15.380\nOh, stars of David on your shirt.\n\n01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.700\nThey're Chicago stars.\n\n01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:17.700\nYeah.\n\n01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:22.380\nYou know, yeah, that, they actually do look more like, you know, so it's fine.\n\n01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:25.820\nI don't like the placement though, because they're like, what are we doing?\n\n01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:29.340\nSo I'm talking, we're getting to know Zach and we're welcoming him and not terrorizing\n\n01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:30.340\nhim.\n\n01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.340\nI want to, now that I know that.\n\n01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:33.340\nAll right.\n\n01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:34.900\nWell, I'll fill you in more carefully.\n\n01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:35.900\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:36.900\nI know.\n\n01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.900\nSo the tail wags the dog around him.\n\n01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:39.900\nHe's like this?\n\n01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:43.260\nHe's, he's, he's in a, he's, he's in a good mood, I think.\n\n01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:44.260\nYeah.\n\n01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:45.260\nWhat's he really like?\n\n01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:46.500\nAre you guys comfortable?\n\n01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.500\nWe want you to feel that way.\n\n01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:54.180\nI'm, as long as I'm amongst you and Dan and Jeff, I'm comfortable.\n\n01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:57.180\nWell, that's not very often in your life, apparently.\n\n01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.180\nSavannah.\n\n01:09:58.180 --> 01:09:59.180\nNice to meet you.\n\n01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.180\nSavannah with one N.\n\n01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:01.620\nUm, what, uh, Zach, what were you going to say?\n\n01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:05.900\nYou said, cause it just cause I'm curious, cause I said, I made the dumb Nazi joke about\n\n01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.380\nyour shaved head for those who are listening.\n\n01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:08.380\nHe has a shaved head.\n\n01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:11.180\nUh, and you said it's not to beat the heat and you didn't finish.\n\n01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:17.300\nWell, I actually, I like it, it's just simply because I don't want to have a receding hairline.\n\n01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:20.180\nUm, and I've got like a little bald spot back here.\n\n01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:24.500\nI'm actually like, I'm about three days past the last time I shaved my head.\n\n01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.900\nSo you can start to see it a little bit.\n\n01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:31.860\nWhere do you do, how do you, do you go, do you go to a barber or do you just do it yourself\n\n01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:32.860\nnow?\n\n01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:37.420\nNo, I just, I just put shaving cream on and so you got one of those like mock 17 blade.\n\n01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:38.420\nOh, right.\n\n01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.940\nDo you, do you, do you pick it like, like, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's, that seems\n\n01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:43.420\nlike a tremendous effort.\n\n01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:48.700\nI, I, it's not really, it's really, it's really easy and very satisfying to imagine.\n\n01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:57.460\nLike every fucking conceivable razor, no, I'm holding like a BIC, like a, no, not one\n\n01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:58.460\nof them.\n\n01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:02.620\nLike I've got like the mock or Gillette, Gillette, something that it's got like a, like a, like\n\n01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:06.820\na rotating ball that has a bunch of a phantasm 2000.\n\n01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:07.820\nYes.\n\n01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:08.820\nYes.\n\n01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:09.820\nIt is.\n\n01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:10.820\nOh boy.\n\n01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:16.180\nFirst, the first metal ball comes in and terrorizes your soul.\n\n01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:21.060\nThe second ball kidnaps your body, fills it with formaldehyde and fuck it.\n\n01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.060\nYeah.\n\n01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:23.660\nHow many of those balls were there?\n\n01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:24.660\nI just remember.\n\n01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:25.660\nThree.\n\n01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:26.660\nThere were three of them.\n\n01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:27.660\nThere were three.\n\n01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:28.660\nI only ever saw phantasm too.\n\n01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:29.860\nWhich was fucked up.\n\n01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.900\nI thought, I was, I was going to a movie theater.\n\n01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:36.940\nI was a kid and it was a radar movie and I was with adults, meaning like my brother's\n\n01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:41.180\nfriends and like, um, I didn't know the word phantasm.\n\n01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:44.060\nI was confusing it with, uh, Phantasia.\n\n01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.060\nOh.\n\n01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:48.780\nAnd so I was like, why are we going to see phantasm too?\n\n01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:52.740\nWho cares what happened to those broomsticks?\n\n01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:55.260\nClearly the lesson was don't play with magic when the wizard's gone.\n\n01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:59.500\nI don't, I think that lesson is like learned and I was like, what the hell's going on?\n\n01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:00.500\nBut I just want to fit in.\n\n01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.980\nAnd then it was a fucking crazy, really cool horror movie.\n\n01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:04.980\nPhantasm too.\n\n01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:08.420\nImagine if the tall man had one of the, had like the, the outfit that Mickey was wearing\n\n01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:09.420\nwith the hat.\n\n01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:10.660\nIt would have been even better.\n\n01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:14.620\nHow is that the, what are the rules there when you just put on a fucking hat and all\n\n01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:18.300\nof a sudden you can make animated golems and shit out of brooms?\n\n01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:21.300\nI think he had a book, I think a spell book.\n\n01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.300\nHe just touched.\n\n01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.800\nOh wait, maybe he did.\n\n01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.300\nAll right.\n\n01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:26.300\nThat tracks.\n\n01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:32.180\nI always thought that was like high level magic he was tabbing it to.\n\n01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:33.180\nHard to believe.\n\n01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:34.180\nWell, it was pretty.\n\n01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:36.340\nI mean, he made an army of self replicating broom men.\n\n01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:37.340\nYeah.\n\n01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.340\nThat's crazy.\n\n01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:40.380\nBut then he, he gets more than he bargained for at some point, right?\n\n01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:42.820\nOh, an army of self replicating broom men.\n\n01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.580\nThat's how magic, that's what magic does.\n\n01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.660\nIt's always more than what you bargained for.\n\n01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.460\nThat's what it says on the cover of that book.\n\n01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:49.460\nYeah.\n\n01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:50.460\nAll right.\n\n01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:55.060\nSo what's your, what are your thoughts about like, and, and listen, bonus points for if\n\n01:12:55.060 --> 01:13:01.380\nyou have thought about taking it into the Balboa specificity.\n\n01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:05.700\nHow do I move, how do I move asses into seats for the, for July 22nd?\n\n01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:07.060\nWell, I'm in, I'm in advertising.\n\n01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.300\nI'm in digital advertising.\n\n01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:09.300\nSo I designed.\n\n01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:10.300\nFingers.\n\n01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:11.300\nFingers.\n\n01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:12.300\nAnd fingers.\n\n01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.300\nDigital fingers.\n\n01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:14.300\nDigits.\n\n01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:17.300\nI think it's the easiest because you're like, Hey, you have 10 of them.\n\n01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:18.300\nYeah.\n\n01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:19.300\nWhy not?\n\n01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:20.300\nWhy not?\n\n01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:21.300\nWhy not?\n\n01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:22.300\nWhy not 11?\n\n01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:23.300\nYeah.\n\n01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:24.300\nThat's all.\n\n01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:25.300\nI mean, digital advertising is essentially this.\n\n01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.300\nSorry.\n\n01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.300\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.300\nHere they are.\n\n01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:29.300\nThey're all here.\n\n01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:30.300\nSorry.\n\n01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:31.300\nAll 10 of them.\n\n01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.300\nSorry.\n\n01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:33.300\nZach, just pretend Dan's not here.\n\n01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.300\nToo late.\n\n01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:43.940\nSo you shave your head, but you leave the beard.\n\n01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:45.940\nThis is how I produce a jawline.\n\n01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:48.380\nI know what you mean, man.\n\n01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.380\nIf I don't have this, I look like a Muppet.\n\n01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:51.380\nYeah.\n\n01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:52.900\nWhat does that term neck beard mean?\n\n01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:55.940\nYou know, I always get so scared because it's like, it's when there's no defining\n\n01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:58.780\nline underneath, but that's good.\n\n01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:03.820\nI mean, you have made a defining line, but if you have a good, strong jawline, if you're\n\n01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:10.580\nlike Jay Cutler from the Bears, who's right, who can do that and get away with it when\n\n01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:13.620\nit's bad, it looks kind of like a main leg.\n\n01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:18.540\nYou're just a fat lion.\n\n01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:20.620\nLike it's really, it's not a beard on your chin.\n\n01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:24.220\nIt's like this hairy ring around your neck.\n\n01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:26.740\nThat's like the failure of the neck beard, I think.\n\n01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:27.740\nYeah.\n\n01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:32.420\nSo Zach, when you're doing the beard, is that all razor?\n\n01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:33.660\nAre you doing electric around there?\n\n01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:34.660\nHow do you?\n\n01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:35.660\nOh, no.\n\n01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:36.660\nThis is laser precise.\n\n01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:37.660\nThis is with a bit too.\n\n01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:38.660\nReally?\n\n01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:39.660\nSo you just...\n\n01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:40.660\nI actually have two razors that I use.\n\n01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:44.380\nI have a ball, Gillette, 17 blade thing for this, and the big for this.\n\n01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:47.700\nAm I wrong in saying exactly you also go on top of the mustache?\n\n01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:48.700\nYes.\n\n01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:57.300\nI've had a beard since I was about three years old, so I've been able to perfect the grooming\n\n01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:58.300\nof...\n\n01:14:58.300 --> 01:14:59.300\nWell, then let me ask you this.\n\n01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:00.300\nI can't grow a nice mustache or a beard.\n\n01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:03.820\nI have very splotchy, patchy, Johnny Depp used car sales.\n\n01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.220\nWell, you have a very beautiful face.\n\n01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.220\nYou don't need to have...\n\n01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:11.260\nAnd facial hair, I think, is for people that are kind of ashamed of their face, like I\n\n01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:12.260\nam.\n\n01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:17.420\nBut you're a very handsome guy, Zach.\n\n01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:19.020\nI've got a great beard.\n\n01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:20.020\nAre you saying if you...\n\n01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:21.020\nBut you have great hair.\n\n01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:24.020\nAre you saying if we saw you without that beard that we would go like, oh, my God.\n\n01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.020\nYeah, I wouldn't be up here.\n\n01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.020\nHave you ever seen...\n\n01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:31.500\nDon't you get a little mad when you see, well, like Daniel Gilley's last week, he had a beard.\n\n01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:35.740\nLike when handsome guys have beards, like it is not like it pisses you off.\n\n01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:41.980\nIt's like, you can tell that it's like, yeah, it is weird.\n\n01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:44.660\nIt's like, it almost looks like they're in disguise.\n\n01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:48.580\nIt's the whole, like, lumberjack, like, lumbersexual thing that goes on.\n\n01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:49.580\nLumbersexual.\n\n01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:53.460\nYeah, I kind of have to, I've named it into mannequins.\n\n01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:54.460\nI'm kind of a lumbersexual.\n\n01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:55.460\nDo you guys...\n\n01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:59.180\nIt's just a leg, though, right?\n\n01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:00.180\nI just got...\n\n01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:03.940\nI got this haircut because I was on Larry King now.\n\n01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:11.460\nIt's like, TV guy, magazine.\n\n01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:19.940\nI got a haircut because I was going to be on Webisodes of what used to be TV, and I thought\n\n01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:24.060\nit was a great haircut, and then Cody was laughing because she said that in the back,\n\n01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:30.940\nhe made me look like a Lego.\n\n01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:31.940\nI saw that.\n\n01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:34.180\nIt's a little too precise.\n\n01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.180\nShe's like, really?\n\n01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:37.340\nShe was like, taking pictures of me from behind.\n\n01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.460\nShe wanted to do a split screen with, like, a Lego guy.\n\n01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:45.260\nYeah, I guess I looked at it, and I was like, yeah, I guess I was pretty straight, and he\n\n01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:46.260\ndid that.\n\n01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:48.140\nBut, I mean, I would have never...\n\n01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:49.140\nAll right.\n\n01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:52.180\nAll right, so digital advertising, what do you think?\n\n01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:55.380\nWhat do we do to get some butts in the Balboas?\n\n01:16:55.380 --> 01:17:00.860\nMy initial instinct is to think visually when advertising, and you've got three strapping\n\n01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:06.420\nyoung men up here that are part of the podcast, that I think we just do a shot with you guys\n\n01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:10.500\nin the same outfits that they're wearing, and now you see me.\n\n01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:15.820\nI don't think that's gonna...\n\n01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:16.820\nI mean...\n\n01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:17.820\nIt is...\n\n01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:18.820\nIt's a...\n\n01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:19.820\nYou listen to it.\n\n01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:20.820\nYeah.\n\n01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:21.820\nIt's a podcast.\n\n01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:22.820\nYou know, it's just like a...\n\n01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:25.300\nWe don't have a budget for, like, a bus stop ad.\n\n01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:29.700\nI'm gonna say, like, all I can think of is bribery, like, show up.\n\n01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:30.700\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:31.700\nPrizes.\n\n01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.420\nOr it also promises, like, okay, so sometimes when we go abroad...\n\n01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:35.420\nWe'll build a wall.\n\n01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:41.140\nLike, and go, like, well, sometimes, you know, sometimes the traveling shows are the drunkest\n\n01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:42.140\nof all.\n\n01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:46.140\nLike, maybe, what if it was like, okay, I promise you, like, what are some features\n\n01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:47.140\nof a show?\n\n01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:51.260\nLike, I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna be drunk, but I will say I won't be blackout drunk when\n\n01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:54.460\nI take the stage, and I...\n\n01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:58.660\nAnd to prove that I'll prepare bits, like, what's like a bit?\n\n01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:06.620\nIf I were to do Savannah, if I were to do bits, like, top ten lists, or like, what kind of...\n\n01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:10.140\nWhat could come out of the Harmontown psyche that you think would be, like, a good, like,\n\n01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:20.060\nkind of feature that you, like, you know, like, Harmon's thoughts or, you know, like,\n\n01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.060\nI'm putting you on the spot.\n\n01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:22.060\nOh, no, that's okay.\n\n01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:27.100\nWell, from the Comic Con show last year, like, kind of going over some of the things you\n\n01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:32.300\nsaw at Comic Con that maybe you could, you know, then talk about for an extended period\n\n01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:33.300\nof time.\n\n01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:37.860\nSo maybe your top ten worst moments at Comic Con are the moments that made you cringe,\n\n01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:39.300\nor moments that really made you...\n\n01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:42.500\nI think, Dan, you should dress as Poison Ivy.\n\n01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:48.020\nBut, again, that's not, I mean, they're gonna be like, okay, cool, dress like Poison Ivy.\n\n01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:49.540\nI'll look that up on...\n\n01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:53.100\nIf you can guarantee, like, guests, but maybe don't say exactly who they are, but, like,\n\n01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:57.060\nkind of give hints as to who they might be that are vague enough that people won't be\n\n01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:58.060\ndisappointed.\n\n01:18:58.060 --> 01:18:59.060\nYeah, that's what we do, Dan.\n\n01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:00.060\nYou just...\n\n01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:01.060\nWe just say that we have an awesome guest.\n\n01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:05.820\nAnd also, Spencer and I are both gonna dress as Slave Leia.\n\n01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:06.820\nAnd Star...\n\n01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:07.820\nYeah.\n\n01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:11.060\nAnd Star Wars 8 is gonna make an appearance.\n\n01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:14.580\nCurtis Armstrong will text...\n\n01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:15.580\nWill text Curtis Armstrong.\n\n01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:16.580\nI heard him say...\n\n01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:17.580\nYeah!\n\n01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.580\nBy the way, where is Curtis?\n\n01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:20.580\nHave we lost him forever?\n\n01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:21.580\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.580\nThank you, Zach.\n\n01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:23.580\nWhere...\n\n01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:24.580\nWhat happened to Curtis?\n\n01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:26.580\nHe said some racist shit to me in the parking lot.\n\n01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:27.580\nOh, no.\n\n01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:31.260\nAnd I was like, dude, that's cool, but, like, people should know you're racist, and he's\n\n01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:36.460\nlike, I don't care about my image, Dan.\n\n01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:38.580\nAnd I said, yes, you do.\n\n01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:44.220\nAnd he said, he's like, no, dude!\n\n01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:50.060\nPeople with different colored skin for me are less people.\n\n01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:55.300\nAnd I was like, Curtis, if anyone could hear you saying this right now, they'd be so broken-hearted.\n\n01:19:55.300 --> 01:20:04.340\nAnd he said, that's the point, baby!\n\n01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:07.140\nThat guy and Christopher Walken sound the exact same.\n\n01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:08.140\nThe exact same.\n\n01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:09.140\nAll right.\n\n01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:10.140\nWait.\n\n01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:11.300\nCurtis Armstrong, I think I only have...\n\n01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:12.820\nZach, do you have any impressions?\n\n01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:16.460\nI had a party, like, who can you break out as an impression?\n\n01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:17.460\nIt hasn't been on the show.\n\n01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:19.300\nI mean, I could do a slight walk-in, but it...\n\n01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:20.300\nGive me a slight walk-in.\n\n01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:22.300\nCan you give me a slight walk-in ordering breakfast?\n\n01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:26.020\nOkay, well, Levy, make sure Curtis Armstrong is... make sure we connect with him and see\n\n01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:28.540\nif he can do the show at the Balboa.\n\n01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:29.540\nAnd I'll pay him.\n\n01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:34.380\nTell him he's got us over a barrel.\n\n01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.380\nAnd then if you come...\n\n01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.380\nAll right.\n\n01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:37.860\nIf you come to the Balboa show...\n\n01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:40.860\nWhich you shouldn't.\n\n01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:47.060\nGuaranteed photograph and...\n\n01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:48.060\nParking lot.\n\n01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.060\nParking lot.\n\n01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:50.060\nHJs.\n\n01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:51.060\nI want...\n\n01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:56.420\nI never really do this except at this show anyway, but when we go out of town, I usually...\n\n01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:59.180\nWell, actually, I've been entering a phase where I'm kind of like, yeah, I don't want\n\n01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:00.180\nto do the...\n\n01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:01.180\nYeah, I think.\n\n01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:06.900\nSo, guaranteed, for sure, no matter how many of you show up at the Balboa, if you paid\n\n01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:12.180\nto get in, then part of that price is you're guaranteed, we'll have to figure out where\n\n01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:15.220\nto go possibly, maybe they'll need the theater.\n\n01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:17.700\nBut I'll do a whole line thing or...\n\n01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:18.700\nTaco is at El Gordo.\n\n01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:21.180\nFigure out how you get a picture, you get a picture.\n\n01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:22.180\nIt sounds presumptuous.\n\n01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:25.140\nI've tried to understand him as a writer, so it sounds weird to try to sell that, like,\n\n01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:26.540\nbecause it's like a thing.\n\n01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:27.540\nBut that would be...\n\n01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:30.500\nThat to me is like a basic thing, like, oh, it's $24.\n\n01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:31.940\nWe're driving to San Diego.\n\n01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:36.060\nI'm definitely going to get a photograph, for sure.\n\n01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:37.060\nIn good lighting.\n\n01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:39.580\nWhy are you shaking your head, Steve?\n\n01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:47.060\nOh, because it's a thousand people, and it'll take technically until Monday to do it.\n\n01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:49.860\nWell, I've done it before.\n\n01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:57.660\nSay you're going to debut the Justice League trailer, and make a fake Justice League trailer,\n\n01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:58.660\nand...\n\n01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:00.340\nOh, I can show something.\n\n01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:01.340\nWrite that down.\n\n01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:09.300\nLet me bring like a Rick and Morty clip, like, in secret.\n\n01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:10.300\nLet's...\n\n01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:14.340\nBecause it's right before we drop all the Harmon Quest episodes, let's just show all the Harmon\n\n01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:15.340\nQuest episodes.\n\n01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:16.340\nIt'll be after.\n\n01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:19.780\nWe even know CISO's not coming to that, and they have no part of it.\n\n01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:28.100\nComic-Con's after we drop Harmon Quest, speaking of which, we just wrapped Harmon Quest.\n\n01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:35.140\n11 days, 11 days until you got to get CISO.\n\n01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:36.940\nAll right.\n\n01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:46.300\nIf you come to the Balboa Theater on July 22nd, I will be there on stage.\n\n01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:49.620\nDo you think they have, like, airplay, like, capability?\n\n01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:52.780\nLike, do you think we could get them to do, like, a projection thing?\n\n01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:53.780\nAll right.\n\n01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:54.780\nNo, we can.\n\n01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:55.780\nWe'll look into this.\n\n01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:56.780\nNo, we'll do that.\n\n01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:57.780\nI will...\n\n01:22:57.780 --> 01:22:58.780\nI'll...\n\n01:22:58.780 --> 01:22:59.780\nI'll write...\n\n01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:03.660\nI'll write...\n\n01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:07.660\nA special Comic-Con episode of Rick and Morty.\n\n01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:08.660\nLive.\n\n01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:10.780\nNo, it should be more...\n\n01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:11.780\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:12.780\nLike, I'll write...\n\n01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:15.780\nI'll write the community movie, like, like, gotta...\n\n01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:20.820\nOr, like, the first act of it, or I'll get as much through it as I can while you watch.\n\n01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:22.820\nI'll start, like...\n\n01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:25.780\nYou'll just see the final drafts up on the screen.\n\n01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:31.660\nYeah, like, fade in, and, like, I'll start writing the community movie until the show\n\n01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:32.660\nstarts.\n\n01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:33.660\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:34.660\nAnd I will...\n\n01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:35.660\nYeah.\n\n01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:36.660\nI like that.\n\n01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:37.660\nAnd then prizes.\n\n01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:44.580\nAnd then there'll be prizes, and Spencer's gonna dress as Poison Ivy, Savannah's gonna\n\n01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:48.180\nbe there, like, doing, like, a Cirque du Soleil thing.\n\n01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:50.780\nShe'll do her aerial ribbon act.\n\n01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:51.780\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:52.780\nYou have to see it.\n\n01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:53.780\nAll right.\n\n01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:56.780\nWell, thanks to our PR department, Savannah.\n\n01:23:56.780 --> 01:24:00.780\nZach and Savannah, please.\n\n01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:03.100\nAll right.\n\n01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:04.100\nThank you.\n\n01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.100\nThank you.\n\n01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:06.100\nThank you.\n\n01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:07.100\nThank you.\n\n01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:11.620\nWhat a great generation, Jeff.\n\n01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:12.860\nThank you, Zach.\n\n01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:13.860\nYou know?\n\n01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:19.500\nI don't say these millennials that they're pieces of shit.\n\n01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:20.500\nI don't see it.\n\n01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:23.340\nBut you fundamentally disagree with that.\n\n01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:24.340\nYeah, I do.\n\n01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:25.340\nI see hope in them.\n\n01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:28.900\nWhat do you think separates the millennials from our generation?\n\n01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:33.980\nI think, you know, I think they're more dishonest about how racist they are.\n\n01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:38.060\nThey've found new ways to tap dance around it.\n\n01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:45.940\nThey're the Baryshnikovs of actual racism.\n\n01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:53.580\nThey come to the table more apple-compatible, for sure.\n\n01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:56.860\nThat's always good.\n\n01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:01.860\nI don't think they're worried about Y2K as much as my generation did.\n\n01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:05.260\nDo you want to come up here?\n\n01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:06.260\nYeah.\n\n01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:08.260\nYeah, yeah, you can't see.\n\n01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:09.260\nAll right.\n\n01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:10.260\nAll right.\n\n01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:15.260\nPlease welcome my co-worker, John Eidzen.\n\n01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:16.260\nEidzen.\n\n01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:25.020\nIs it just Eidzen?\n\n01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:26.660\nIt's Edzen, actually.\n\n01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:28.420\nWhere's the I?\n\n01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:29.420\nIt's silent.\n\n01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:30.420\nYeah.\n\n01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:31.420\nYeah.\n\n01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:32.420\nAll right.\n\n01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.420\nYour last name is E-I-D-S-O-N.\n\n01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:34.420\nMm-hmm.\n\n01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:35.420\nWhere's your buddy?\n\n01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:40.100\nWell, he's off in Tahoe for 4th of July, so he's going to be very sad that he wasn't\n\n01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:41.100\nhere.\n\n01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:43.620\nJohn, whose name I just learned isn't his partner's name, Nick.\n\n01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:46.220\nYou're really selling that I'm a co-worker here.\n\n01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:47.220\nYeah.\n\n01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:54.460\nHe's, we sold an idea to FX called Happy City, which is going to be like, it's like a Thomas\n\n01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:59.460\nthe Tank Engine kind of thing, but it's like, it's friends and they're hanging out.\n\n01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:04.660\nYeah, it's a taxi and a helicopter and an ambulance and another taxi.\n\n01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:05.660\nYeah.\n\n01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:06.660\nYeah.\n\n01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:08.580\nAnd they hang out.\n\n01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:09.580\nThey're millennial vehicles.\n\n01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:11.260\nI think they're sold on it already.\n\n01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:17.060\nIn the big city, Happy City, and it's hard to be in the Happy City, especially when like\n\n01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:22.900\none of the characters, and I'm not going to spoil it, it's Tyler the Taxi.\n\n01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:24.900\nYou're not that happy.\n\n01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:26.940\nOh, shit.\n\n01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:31.540\nBut really it's just, we've been calling it friends or Seinfeld without arms.\n\n01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:32.540\nYeah.\n\n01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:33.540\nYeah.\n\n01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:37.580\nWhen we sold the show, I don't think we realized how hard it was going to be to write for characters\n\n01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:40.860\nthat can't pick things up.\n\n01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:45.140\nYou wouldn't believe how many fucking conversations we had.\n\n01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:46.140\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:54.420\nPeople don't understand tonality in television is this totally fractal, continuum-based thing.\n\n01:26:54.420 --> 01:27:01.900\nThere is no, oh, is it going to be funny like Chappelle's show, or is there going to be\n\n01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:04.900\nfunny like Larry Sanders?\n\n01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:08.580\nIt's like, no, it's like, there's questions that you don't know that you don't have the\n\n01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:10.140\nanswers to until you ask them.\n\n01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:14.540\nFor instance, on Rick and Morty, the whole big decision we had to make when we were writing\n\n01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:18.820\nthe pilot for Rick and Morty, Justin and I, we had to have like a three-hour conversation,\n\n01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:26.460\nand the end of it all was just saying, look, I don't know how to define the rules of the\n\n01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:31.340\nuniverse, but we're just going to say, if a kid comes through a portal into his high\n\n01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:37.180\nschool cafeteria, it doesn't change his social status within the high school.\n\n01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:39.900\nIt's more like he came in on a skateboard.\n\n01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:43.900\nHe came in through the portal, but he fell down.\n\n01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:48.660\nThe cute girl that he has a crush on says, did you just come through a portal?\n\n01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:50.140\nDid you just do that?\n\n01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:53.300\nBut she doesn't mean like, is there a God?\n\n01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:55.700\nAre you the Messiah?\n\n01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:56.700\nDoes this change everything?\n\n01:27:56.700 --> 01:28:00.820\nIt's not even like pulling up in a Ferrari in the 80s.\n\n01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:05.220\nIt's just like, so you make these decisions, so we had to make the decision that these\n\n01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:12.100\nare cars and helicopters and fire trucks and shit, and everything's alive, but they have\n\n01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:13.100\nto have apartments.\n\n01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:17.580\nBut the apartments also have to have personalities.\n\n01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:23.900\nSo yeah, if you come to this show with questions about internal logic, you're purposely fucked.\n\n01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:26.260\nYeah, I'll leave your logic at the door.\n\n01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:29.580\nDonnie the door.\n\n01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:32.260\nAre other things than humans and vehicles alive?\n\n01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:34.100\nLike, yeah, the whole city is alive.\n\n01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:36.100\nYeah, there's people.\n\n01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:37.100\nYeah.\n\n01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:44.900\nBut we kind of see the people like flies or like horses see flies and just kind of brushing\n\n01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:45.900\nthem off.\n\n01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:46.900\nYeah.\n\n01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:50.740\nSo like taxis, like take them and dump them off or like, but like, yeah, like if your\n\n01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:56.380\nfriend's in the ambulance and then he's like, hey, hey Tyler, do you want, do you want some\n\n01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:57.380\npeople?\n\n01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:01.100\nYeah, I do, that's my job and then like he pulls up and like put, throws some people\n\n01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:05.620\nfrom the ambulance into the taxi, but then your boss will yell at you about that later\n\n01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:07.660\nbecause you're not supposed to do that.\n\n01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:10.780\nLike an ambulance is supposed to take the people to the hospital.\n\n01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:13.660\nYou're not supposed to just because you're a taxi take people out of an ambulance.\n\n01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:15.660\nAnd the hospital also being a character.\n\n01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:19.060\nLet's say it's just two cars hanging out like the best friends.\n\n01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:21.580\nDo they go out to a restaurant and sit at a car restaurant?\n\n01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:22.580\nYes.\n\n01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:23.580\nBut it's not a car restaurant.\n\n01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:24.580\nIt's just a restaurant.\n\n01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:25.940\nBecause they're not drinking motor oil.\n\n01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:28.380\nThey're eating pancakes and floating drinks to their faces.\n\n01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:29.380\nHow are they seated?\n\n01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:30.380\nLike, are they seated?\n\n01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:35.060\nLike, I'll pull up to the table, but then, but then if there's like a, you know, we had\n\n01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:39.260\na long time because like if somebody's like, if somebody's talking and it's like clear,\n\n01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:42.500\nlike if there's a subplot about like, well, I think that person might be gay, but they're\n\n01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:43.500\nnot admitting it yet.\n\n01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:46.260\nAnd then there's these two people have been talking about it, but this person says something\n\n01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:50.340\nthat this person, this car and this, the helicopter is like, like saying something.\n\n01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:54.340\nBut then you pan over to the other taxi and they don't have arms.\n\n01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:57.420\nSo there's just a knife and fork floating in front of them.\n\n01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:03.020\nBut their eyes are going, which is a universal language.\n\n01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:04.020\nYeah.\n\n01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:05.420\nIt's like, like, like they don't have arms.\n\n01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:10.780\nSo it's just a knife and fork floating, but they're going, you know, see, somebody's\n\n01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:11.780\ngay apartment.\n\n01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:16.300\nIs it, is there like a shot of a car just laying in bed like, like wondering what he's\n\n01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:17.300\ndoing with his life?\n\n01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:19.700\nIf he's sick, if the car is sick, does he, is he in bed?\n\n01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:24.020\nWe haven't, I guess so, I feel like we're going to have to get back to you on that\n\n01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:25.020\nnote.\n\n01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:27.500\nBecause the alternative would be that he's at Jiffy Lube and it's dumb.\n\n01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:28.500\nYeah.\n\n01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.140\nOnce you start Yankevicking it, you're fucked.\n\n01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:31.140\nYeah.\n\n01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:36.620\nInitially, initially we pictured them going into houses or apartments and then going to\n\n01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:41.100\ntheir rooms and they have a little garage inside of their room that they go into, which\n\n01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.140\nbecame a little too cute, I think.\n\n01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:44.140\nYeah.\n\n01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:47.660\nSo now I was saying for a while, well, when they hang out, they should just be at an\n\n01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:48.660\nintersection.\n\n01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:52.700\nLike, yeah, but then it's like, well, how many episodes of this are we going to do and\n\n01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:57.780\nhow much of a 25-year-old's life is about cohabitation and about landlord conflict and\n\n01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:02.060\nabout property value and like, aren't they going to get texts and like, and for a while\n\n01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:03.980\nI was like, well, maybe they don't get texts.\n\n01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:08.740\nLet's rise above it and like, but I was like, there's no fucking way, like the cars just\n\n01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:12.740\nhave phones that'll just float out in front of them and then they'll text each other and\n\n01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:13.740\nthey live in apartments.\n\n01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:18.540\nIf the cars, let's say one of your main characters is a car and goes to like, would they go to\n\n01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:19.540\na rock concert?\n\n01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:22.620\nAnd if they go to the rock concert, would it all just be cars, or would there be people\n\n01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:24.140\nthere too, or just cars?\n\n01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:28.580\nThere would be people, like if you squint or freeze frame, there would be people climbing\n\n01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:29.580\nall over the place.\n\n01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:33.900\nBecause like, there is a plane of the universe where this show is actually about the people\n\n01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:38.700\nwho don't understand why their cars are doing all this.\n\n01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:43.500\nBut we had a long time where I was saying, oh, you have to hold it up to both realities\n\n01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:47.940\nwhere every episode, if you watch every frame, you like, everything makes sense in some weird\n\n01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:52.980\nway that like, like the way that we're controlled by brain chemicals.\n\n01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:55.700\nSo I was like, why did that guy take a hatchet to his family?\n\n01:31:55.700 --> 01:32:00.180\nWell, like, like because he's fucking, he's schizophrenic, but also had a little bit, just\n\n01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:01.420\na touch of Asperger's.\n\n01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:02.900\nAnd then it was Tuesday.\n\n01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:08.380\nAnd so, but, but the truth is like some forensic files, there's just like, you know, it's like,\n\n01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:11.180\nhow much control, what is the difference between free will and destiny?\n\n01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:12.780\nAnd we don't, we don't really know.\n\n01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:14.420\nWe just feel like we're making these choices.\n\n01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:18.100\nSo why wouldn't these cars just feel like they're having these stories where they're\n\n01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.100\nlike, fuck you, buddy.\n\n01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:20.100\nAnd then they drive away.\n\n01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:24.940\nBut in reality, on the people's side, if you look at it, you can see two tiny people\n\n01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.940\nthat are like mad at each other as well.\n\n01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:28.940\nAnd like, but I think we let that go.\n\n01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:29.940\nYeah.\n\n01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:33.580\nNow it's just cars that go to a rock concert, probably, and there's people like just climbing\n\n01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:34.580\nall over the place.\n\n01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:36.980\nMaybe we'll have the Easter egg of what the people are doing.\n\n01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:41.380\nBut ultimately, I think it's kind of that maybe the team America thing of how do the\n\n01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:43.140\ncars play basketball?\n\n01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:44.140\nLet's figure it out.\n\n01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.140\nWe haven't made it yet.\n\n01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.140\nSo that's going to be the next step.\n\n01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:47.820\nSo the cars are playing basketball.\n\n01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:49.740\nWhat is the diameter of the basketball?\n\n01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:50.740\nWho made the basketball?\n\n01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:53.100\nThese are like, no, it's just a car.\n\n01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:54.780\nIt's proportionate to the car.\n\n01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:58.340\nSo like, oh, if a person got out of that car, that'd be a giant basketball.\n\n01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:00.780\nNo, it's a basketball for the cars.\n\n01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:01.900\nIt's dribbling next to them.\n\n01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:04.340\nThey have no arm.\n\n01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:05.340\nDeal with it.\n\n01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:08.820\nAnd the way we're dealing with it is we're going to have a live action mayor.\n\n01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:09.820\nYeah, we got it.\n\n01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:10.820\nWe got it.\n\n01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:11.820\nI think we should put out the call right now.\n\n01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:13.820\nWe'd like it to be Michael Shannon, actor Michael Shannon.\n\n01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:18.460\nIf anyone knows him.\n\n01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:22.540\nIn between scenes, we'd like to just go back to the mayor's office and have fucking freaky\n\n01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:29.700\nMichael Shannon just intensely ask a lot of the questions that you were about to ask\n\n01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:35.820\nand then answer them with like, I don't know, being mayor doesn't mean I'm in control.\n\n01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:40.620\nAll I know is that when two friends are jealous of a third friend, like the shit goes down,\n\n01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:45.340\nthe stories are held together by emotional, because also, like, guess what, when you're\n\n01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:48.740\nwatching Seinfeld, why does everybody always sit on one side of the table?\n\n01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:51.980\nI mean, you can't turn you back to the camera.\n\n01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:56.580\nIt's just as unnatural as if everyone was cars.\n\n01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:59.740\nThere's always a reason why everything's fucking weird and you have to, like, maybe\n\n01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:00.740\nwe're all cars.\n\n01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:02.220\nMaybe we are all cars.\n\n01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.220\nThat's what the show makes you ask.\n\n01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:05.340\nHow often do you wonder where a basketball came from?\n\n01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:06.340\nYeah.\n\n01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.340\nYeah, why?\n\n01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:08.340\nYeah.\n\n01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:09.340\nWho made this orange?\n\n01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:10.340\nYeah.\n\n01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:11.340\nDid they answer that?\n\n01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:12.340\nYeah.\n\n01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:13.340\nYeah.\n\n01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:14.340\nDid they answer your question?\n\n01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:15.340\nYeah, it does.\n\n01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:16.340\nI think it's going to be really good show.\n\n01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:17.340\nSo are we still writing it?\n\n01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:22.980\nI want to watch the show, because also, like, I want to watch that show and wonder, I want\n\n01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:26.460\nto have a lot of questions about it, and I want to find out that they're not going to\n\n01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:29.340\nbe answered or they're going to be answered very slowly or...\n\n01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:30.900\nYeah, remember ABC's Cavemen?\n\n01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:31.900\nYes, I do.\n\n01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:36.580\nLike, that show could have lasted a hundred episodes if it had just accepted that it was\n\n01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:37.580\nfucked up.\n\n01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:38.580\nIt was fucked up.\n\n01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:39.580\nYeah.\n\n01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:46.180\nAnd I still have the pilot that never aired of Cavemen, which was way more racist, where\n\n01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:52.260\nthe Cavemen were really good dancers and had big dicks and had lots of rhythm and stuff\n\n01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:54.780\nlike that.\n\n01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:57.140\nThey dropped that for the unerring pilot.\n\n01:34:57.140 --> 01:35:01.540\nOkay, here's what we do, about both theater, July 22nd.\n\n01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:05.180\nYou're going to have to raise those same prizes.\n\n01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:08.140\nWe show the unerred pilot of Cavemen.\n\n01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:16.060\nHoly smoke, they asked me to audition for that one, and I declined.\n\n01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:19.140\nEven Saturday night, I know a lot of people auditioned for Cavemen and didn't get the\n\n01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:20.140\njob.\n\n01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:26.300\nWell, Nick Kroll did, and he was really, that's how I met Nick Kroll, I found out he was the\n\n01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:31.180\nsmart Caveman in Cavemen, he was the one with the glasses, and I asked him 500 Cavemen questions,\n\n01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:32.700\nhe answered every single one.\n\n01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:37.220\nIt was the first time I'd ever met him, and I was like, that guy's cool, man.\n\n01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:38.220\nHe did not.\n\n01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:39.220\nYeah.\n\n01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:44.220\nCavemen's worth a look, it's worth watching, what was it, four episodes, how many did they\n\n01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:45.220\nmake?\n\n01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:47.220\nI think like four aired, they probably made six.\n\n01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:50.020\nIt is fucking bonkers.\n\n01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:51.020\nWhat year was this?\n\n01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:52.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:53.020\nWow.\n\n01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:57.860\nI think someone from the cast is here.\n\n01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:02.500\n2006 sounds good, sounds like the year.\n\n01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:06.220\nYeah, it's fucking, I have it at my place, please come over and watch it with me, it's\n\n01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:07.220\nreally good.\n\n01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:08.220\nAll thousand people.\n\n01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:12.860\nYou know, I treat yourself, find the pilot to Mr. Edd.\n\n01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:16.580\nIt's one of the funniest goddamn half hours of TV you'll ever see in your life.\n\n01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:21.020\nSo John, tell everybody that I'm fun to work with.\n\n01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:22.820\nI wasn't done with Mr. Edd, dad.\n\n01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:26.140\nWell, I'm not fun, but just tell him it's amazing to work with me.\n\n01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:27.740\nIt's so amazing.\n\n01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:28.820\nFor example.\n\n01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:37.220\nAt his house, you're greeted by his dogs immediately, did you get peed on?\n\n01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:38.220\nJust a little.\n\n01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:39.220\nYeah.\n\n01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:40.220\nJust a little.\n\n01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:42.420\nWell, Harvey growls at me a lot.\n\n01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:43.420\nBut he doesn't know what growl means.\n\n01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:44.420\nBut he doesn't know what that means.\n\n01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:45.420\nHe thinks it means play with me.\n\n01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:48.700\nOh, sorry, I wasn't selling this well enough.\n\n01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:49.700\nNo, no.\n\n01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:54.540\nWell, there is the Apple TV thing, like, because I tried to put up on the screen and then I\n\n01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:55.540\nwas like.\n\n01:36:55.540 --> 01:37:00.980\nYou know, embarrassing things pop up whenever Dan turns his Apple TV on, started taking\n\n01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:09.540\nphotos to Dan's shame of the Kelly Clarkson songs revealed of last played on the Apple\n\n01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:10.540\nTV.\n\n01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:11.540\nThat's fun.\n\n01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:12.540\nWe have a good laugh about that.\n\n01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:13.540\nYeah.\n\n01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:14.540\nWelcome, guys.\n\n01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:15.540\nAll right.\n\n01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:16.540\nLet's open a laptop.\n\n01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:17.540\nApple TV is not working.\n\n01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:20.820\nIt'll be bitching about it for a while, like squaring and going like, fuck the technology.\n\n01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:21.820\nFuck, fuck, fuck.\n\n01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:23.940\nHe's got a fish tank that he's still learning how to work.\n\n01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:28.460\nThen comes up and it says Kelly Clarkson, whatever makes you stronger, whatever the fuck it\n\n01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:29.460\nis.\n\n01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:35.620\nAnd it's like, as Nick pointed out, the progress indicator is five seconds before the end of\n\n01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:40.380\nthe song, which means like, it's like, there's unmistakings, like there's nothing you could\n\n01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:41.380\ndo.\n\n01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:42.380\nYou could never get out of it.\n\n01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:43.380\nYeah.\n\n01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:44.380\nThere's no, I got hacked.\n\n01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:45.380\nMy account got hacked.\n\n01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:52.860\nNo, you listened to the song, you danced to it and you're underwear and then the doorball\n\n01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:53.860\nrang.\n\n01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:54.860\nHow are the fish doing?\n\n01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:55.860\nAre the fish thriving?\n\n01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:58.940\nHe has a hard time dealing with the light.\n\n01:37:58.940 --> 01:37:59.940\nThat's okay now.\n\n01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:00.940\nYeah.\n\n01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:01.940\nOh, okay.\n\n01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:02.940\nGood.\n\n01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:03.940\nThank God for Golan.\n\n01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:04.940\nYeah.\n\n01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:05.940\nGolan, the fish guy.\n\n01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:06.940\nHe's important to the household.\n\n01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:07.940\nYeah.\n\n01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:11.380\nI'm a dick to the aquarium guy.\n\n01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:13.100\nDidn't he steal the remote?\n\n01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:16.460\nWasn't there a hubbub with this remote?\n\n01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:19.900\nThe light didn't work for a while and he didn't tell me he had to open the cabinet in order\n\n01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:23.420\nfor the remote for the light on the fish tank to work.\n\n01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:30.620\nThat means it's not a remote.\n\n01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:35.500\nIt's a detachable button pad.\n\n01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:38.660\nBecause if you have to open the, I mean, not that I needed it to be remote.\n\n01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:44.060\nI'd love a button under the cabinet that just turns the light on so you can see the fish.\n\n01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:46.700\nThe fish have a light cycle.\n\n01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:53.620\nOnce the fish live their natural life in a two-foot tank, they'd go crazy going like,\n\n01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:55.300\nwhy isn't it morning yet?\n\n01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:57.780\nWhy is it nighttime?\n\n01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:01.580\nSo it goes around a cycle, but the only time people are going to come over to my place\n\n01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:04.940\nand see the fish, it's there in their nighttime.\n\n01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:06.740\nSo it's a black tank.\n\n01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:14.180\nSo they want to hit a button and go, there's the fish, look, there's a prawn.\n\n01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:16.860\nSo I went back and forth with this guy, and I'm a huge dick.\n\n01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:18.860\nI read one of my texts when I was going through the divorce.\n\n01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:21.340\nI did this whole, it was like, I don't work that.\n\n01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:23.180\nYeah, you were like, quoting Edward Albee.\n\n01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:28.860\nWell, while you were there, yeah, I said, this was the most, I said, like, because it\n\n01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:31.780\nwas like the fifth time I asked about the remote not working for the light.\n\n01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:36.860\nAnd then I tagged it with a generic, if you ever want to just like be a dick that seems\n\n01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:42.180\nintellectual, I said, I feel like I'm in an Edward Albee play.\n\n01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:44.900\nWhich one?\n\n01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:49.300\nWho's turned in the tank on?\n\n01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:52.380\nAnd then he was like, no, and he called me and he's like, he's going to open the door.\n\n01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:57.460\nIt's not a good way to end the show.\n\n01:39:57.460 --> 01:40:00.460\nSo it sounds like a lot of people are going to watch on FX when we have our Happy City\n\n01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:03.940\nshow.\n\n01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:07.060\nAfter they pick it up, after we turn in the script, we've got some work to do.\n\n01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:13.620\nSo I keep pushing the meetings where I have to do a pass on the script.\n\n01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:16.940\nBut John, what's your least favorite thing about working with Dan?\n\n01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:23.580\nWhat's the downside to working with Dan Harmon?\n\n01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:24.580\nHis unavailability.\n\n01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:28.060\nOh, because you want more of me.\n\n01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:29.060\nYeah.\n\n01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:30.060\nWait, that makes sense.\n\n01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:31.060\nNo, that's a scarcity.\n\n01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:33.060\nI'm going to stick with that.\n\n01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:36.300\nNow you're a busy man.\n\n01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:39.380\nYou're a hard worker.\n\n01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:42.260\nYou guys are all lucky to be getting his time right now.\n\n01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:45.540\nI fight before it sometimes, I think.\n\n01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:46.540\nThat's true.\n\n01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:48.660\nIt's not a joke.\n\n01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:51.220\nYou guys are delightful, by the way.\n\n01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:54.940\nThese guys, they were YouTubers.\n\n01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:57.820\nConsimate good sports, these guys.\n\n01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:03.100\nThey haven't been in the TV world yet.\n\n01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:06.140\nSomething like indoctrinating them into like, no, you just got to write a shitty script.\n\n01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:10.620\nIt was terrifying for you guys, but you guys are like fucking churning shit out.\n\n01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:13.100\nWe did what you said we don't.\n\n01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:16.140\nYou guys are doing shit that does not feel good for you to do because I asked you to\n\n01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:17.140\ndo it.\n\n01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:18.620\nAnd you're getting punished for it.\n\n01:41:18.620 --> 01:41:19.620\nThat's great.\n\n01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:20.620\nNo.\n\n01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:21.620\nNo.\n\n01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:23.060\nI mean, to be honest, it's been awesome.\n\n01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:29.700\nWe just got the absolute luck of getting to pitch Dan this idea that you liked enough\n\n01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:33.580\nto take out with us, and we've been learning so much from you.\n\n01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:34.580\nIt's been awesome.\n\n01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:37.060\nI mean, we watched community from the beginning.\n\n01:41:37.060 --> 01:41:38.060\nWe've watched all your stuff.\n\n01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:39.060\nSo to be learning.\n\n01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:43.100\nIf he's abusing you, just blink twice.\n\n01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:49.580\nBut yeah, no, it's great.\n\n01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:50.580\nIt's been awesome.\n\n01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:51.580\nI'm a good person.\n\n01:41:51.580 --> 01:42:03.540\nI have a reputation for not, and I don't know why I'm not in a better mood because tonight,\n\n01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:05.660\nI usually have work tomorrow when I come to the show.\n\n01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:07.420\nI should be in a good mood.\n\n01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:08.700\nI have tomorrow off.\n\n01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:13.980\nWell, from moment one, honestly, you were so gracious to hear our idea, which I think\n\n01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:18.700\nkind of surprised us because we weren't...\n\n01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:21.260\nI urged him not to take that meeting.\n\n01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:23.700\nI said, these guys are YouTubers.\n\n01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:24.700\nIt's not worth it.\n\n01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:26.660\nThey're never going to mount to anything.\n\n01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:29.220\nI've probably never wrote a script in their life.\n\n01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:33.020\nI feel this is where I've known Dan forever, and he shot down my skateboard TV show where\n\n01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:34.020\neverybody was skateboards.\n\n01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:36.020\nHe didn't like it.\n\n01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:39.380\nWell, we took the best parts of that.\n\n01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:41.700\nThe thing is, my skateboards had arms.\n\n01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:49.100\nThat's worked out beforehand.\n\n01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:50.100\nI always...\n\n01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:53.660\nThe running joke with these guys is I keep pretending that I'm using them to get close\n\n01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:58.700\nto PewDiePie, but I have a...\n\n01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:00.020\nYou bring them up an awful lot.\n\n01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:06.780\nI looked on the calendar, there's a PewDiePie meeting coming up.\n\n01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:07.780\nOh, shit.\n\n01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:09.540\nPewDiePie's a big fan of Harmontown.\n\n01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:14.100\nWe can really elevate his craft.\n\n01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:15.100\nHe's coming in.\n\n01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:16.620\nJeff doesn't know what the PewDiePie is.\n\n01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:17.940\nHe's just a phenomenon.\n\n01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:20.100\nWe're currently working with Dan.\n\n01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:22.820\nWe'll move on to you, I guess, at once.\n\n01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:23.820\nThink about it.\n\n01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:27.220\nIf the Beatles was on YouTube, it's like...\n\n01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:30.100\nHe's like the Beatles of YouTube.\n\n01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:31.100\nHe's a video game reviewer.\n\n01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:33.620\nIt's a perfect analogy.\n\n01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:39.340\nHe's like the biggest fucking force on that entire place.\n\n01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:40.340\nAll right.\n\n01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:41.340\nYeah.\n\n01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:42.340\nOkay.\n\n01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:46.340\nHe's the Tim Allen of YouTube in 1998.\n\n01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:50.540\nYeah, he makes noises.\n\n01:43:50.540 --> 01:43:51.940\nHis name is PewDiePie?\n\n01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:52.940\nYeah.\n\n01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:53.940\nPewDiePie.\n\n01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:56.900\nHe's from

Comic-Con show, would you come to the Comic-Con\n\n01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:17.580\nshow?\n\n01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:20.900\nI really thought the audience would be too generous.\n\n01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:21.900\nI don't believe that.\n\n01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:23.900\nThey're going to come and it's just going to be me.\n\n01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:24.900\nAnd you know he's listening because he's a fan.\n\n01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:25.900\nAnd now he's like...\n\n01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:26.900\nYou know who else is a fan?\n\n01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:27.900\nLin-Mo Manuel Miranda.\n\n01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:33.260\nAnd I started Mad Beef with that guy.\n\n01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:34.260\nWell, he wants to...\n\n01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:35.260\nHe hates me.\n\n01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:36.260\nHe wants to come on the show.\n\n01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:37.900\nNo, he wants to tear me apart.\n\n01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:38.900\nI don't think so.\n\n01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:39.900\nI don't want to see him.\n\n01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:43.900\nI'm afraid of what he'll do to me.\n\n01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:44.900\nWell, I may...\n\n01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:45.900\nAnd not in a racist way.\n\n01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:48.900\nI may have to have him on the show because he wants to come on the show.\n\n01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:52.900\nNo, it'd be amazing, but I think he really just wants to take me to task.\n\n01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:54.900\nI guess it'd be worth it.\n\n01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:55.900\nYeah, it'd be worth it.\n\n01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:56.900\nYeah.\n\n01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:58.900\nWhat did you do to him?\n\n01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:03.900\nI said some not nice things about Hamilton.\n\n01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:04.900\nLike, I don't get it.\n\n01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.900\nIt's just rapping.\n\n01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:09.900\nAnd then someone was like, that's not very nice.\n\n01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:14.900\nI love Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\n01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:19.900\nAnd then he follows me because he's apparently a huge fan of Harmontown.\n\n01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:22.900\nAnd he sees me tweet and he gets real mad.\n\n01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:23.900\nI don't know.\n\n01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:24.900\nWell, maybe not real mad.\n\n01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:25.900\nNo, he gets so mad.\n\n01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:26.900\nHe gets steamed.\n\n01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:29.900\nWe should have him do a rap battle with Dan.\n\n01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:31.900\nOh, no, I know.\n\n01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:32.900\nYeah.\n\n01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:34.900\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:39.900\nOr is he too chicken?\n\n01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:42.900\nTo come to the Balboa Theater.\n\n01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:44.900\nThat's what we're trying to...\n\n01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:46.900\nOn August 4th.\n\n01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:49.900\nLet's look into him too for the...\n\n01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:54.900\nThat's our takeaway. A big A-list guest for the Balboa.\n\n01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:55.900\nObviously.\n\n01:45:55.900 --> 01:45:56.900\nYeah.\n\n01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:57.900\nObviously.\n\n01:45:57.900 --> 01:45:58.900\nLet's do it.\n\n01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:00.900\nWhat's Felicia Day doing?\n\n01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:02.900\nShe'll be at the Geek and Sundry lounge.\n\n01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:04.900\nWe'll be hanging out.\n\n01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:13.900\nBecause I can get you sherry otary.\n\n01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:17.900\nWell, what have we learned tonight?\n\n01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:19.900\nJohn.\n\n01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:21.900\nWhat have we learned tonight?\n\n01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:25.900\nOh, man. A lot about the forensic files.\n\n01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:26.900\nPuba cares.\n\n01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:29.900\nI wonder if there's anything I left off of them.\n\n01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:32.900\nDid we learn everything we needed to know about Puba cares?\n\n01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:33.900\nThey travel.\n\n01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:34.900\nYeah.\n\n01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:36.900\nOr migrate.\n\n01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:37.900\nOkay.\n\n01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:39.900\nWhat about kid murder?\n\n01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:40.900\nHow to do it?\n\n01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:43.900\nIf you want to get away with a murder, the best way to do it is have a boat.\n\n01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:45.900\nYou got to have your own boat.\n\n01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:49.900\nYou can't borrow a boat because they go, oh, did you borrow a boat recently?\n\n01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:50.900\nYeah.\n\n01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:52.900\nIf you're onto that now, though, because now it's like, if you murder...\n\n01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:58.900\nI mean, you can't have a boat that you just teleport to, so the docs just have cameras all over them.\n\n01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:04.900\nSo if you get on the boat with somebody you don't like and you come back alone, that holds up in court.\n\n01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:09.900\nHave a boat, own the security cameras like system.\n\n01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:14.900\nAlso, have a carpet business where you're constantly rolling up carpets and putting them on your boat.\n\n01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:21.900\nBut you got to do that for like four or three, three, four years of rolling up carpets and putting them on your boat in under the water carpeting.\n\n01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:24.900\nThere's only one thing we didn't talk about tonight.\n\n01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:29.900\nI was talking about selfie sticks and I was asking questions about them and how they worked.\n\n01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:38.900\nAnd then it came around to, we'll skip a couple of steps because it came around to, I started looking it up and I saw that museums were banning selfie sticks in Europe.\n\n01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:45.900\nAnd I was like, yeah, do you really want to be on the side of that snobbery? Aren't American tourists? We're always going to be obnoxious.\n\n01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:50.900\nWho knows? Who do you side with in that Mothra versus Gamera fight?\n\n01:47:50.900 --> 01:47:55.900\nAnd then Jeff was saying, I wouldn't allow selfie sticks at my museum.\n\n01:47:55.900 --> 01:48:05.900\nAnd I was like, I know one reason why you shouldn't is because you could use them in an elaborate crown, what do you call it, affair.\n\n01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:12.900\nLike your selfie stick is easily, yeah, take it easy. I was testing it. Obviously it's a heist tool.\n\n01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:19.900\nYou could disguise a selfie stick, you know, you could use a selfie stick to do a lot of Hudson Hawk like painting, grabbing.\n\n01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:20.900\nWithout question.\n\n01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:28.900\nAnd then Jeff brought up this thing where he said, like, if I had a museum, I would invite people, I would not allow selfie sticks,\n\n01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:33.900\nbut I would, just to make it clear that it wasn't about that, I would say, go ahead, rob my museum.\n\n01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:37.900\nAnd so then it started me thinking, so here's my pitch.\n\n01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:43.900\nYeah, I challenged it was like, show me what you got. Like I dare you to try to get away with robbing my museum.\n\n01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:48.900\nSo here's my museum pitch. This is how you make like a profitable museum.\n\n01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:56.900\nSo you know, every museum has like a gift shop with like key chains and like Chinese finger traps and like fans and like,\n\n01:48:56.900 --> 01:49:02.900\nyou know, like at the Getty, you go there, you get a Chinese finger trap.\n\n01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:06.900\nOn the way out.\n\n01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:17.900\nSo you take that shit, you put it on display in your museum, you fill the gift shop with incredibly expensive heist items.\n\n01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:21.900\nOh, welcome to my teddy bear key chain museum.\n\n01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:24.900\nBy the way, we encourage you to rob it while you're here.\n\n01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:29.900\nCan we interest you in a $5,000 can of laser spray?\n\n01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:36.900\nThe spray you use to reveal where the lasers are?\n\n01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:41.900\nWould you like some Night Vision goggles for $48,000?\n\n01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:44.900\nShouldn't the art there be expensive? We say they use that laser spray.\n\n01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:48.900\nNo, the art there is it. People are constantly fucking stealing shit.\n\n01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:53.900\nThey're dangling down on why are you sold them for $50,000 a foot?\n\n01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:57.900\nSnatching your teddy bear that costs $3 to replace?\n\n01:49:57.900 --> 01:49:59.900\nI'm a genius.\n\n01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:04.900\nWouldn't they take your expensive heist items and go to a museum that had expensive art?\n\n01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:07.900\nNo, they wouldn't.
