WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, the NerdMelt Theater.

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
Spencer Crittenden.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
Spencer gambling across the stage.

00:26.000 --> 00:34.000
And the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
Well, thank you. Thank you.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Oh, thank you.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
Yeah, blips and chips. That's my shirt.

00:47.000 --> 00:54.000
Dan, do you know that tomorrow would be our fourth anniversary of the first Harmontown?

00:54.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah, it's the fourth anniversary, Dan.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
How do we keep it so fresh after all these years?

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah, no. I have no idea. I don't know.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
That's going to be a bad show. I've been having a very relaxing weekend.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
And you know how it gets, you know, your energy flags a little bit.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
You start playing your cookies and like that fucking Transformers game you're playing.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Transformers Earth Wars.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
It's Clash of Clans with Transformers.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Jeff's playing it.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
You don't have to play it, Dan.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Are you also playing Clash of Clans or are you...

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
I think I'm starting to trail off on the Clash of Clans

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
because now I get to be an Optimus Prime or a Bumblebee.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
I wanted to tell you guys, all I can really share with you

01:53.000 --> 02:00.000
is the result of good seven hours of forensic file viewing today.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
I can tell you that pubic hairs travel or migrate.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I wrote that down. That was so funny.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
From room to room.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I noticed like they reused...

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Wait, by their own volition?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Do they have to hitch a ride on time?

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
That's why I think they use the phrase travel or migrate

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
because they said either travel or migrate the first time by itself

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
and then they're like, people are going to think they're like alive like worms.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
But I saw the episode where they really walked you through

02:32.000 --> 02:41.000
finding out that pubic hairs travel or migrate to different rooms.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Wait, tell me more about pubic hair migration.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Tell me more about your weird friend.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
You saw him too?

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
A fellow. What is your name, good sir?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Luke.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Thank you, brother.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
He just spirited me up a little airport bottle of Frenet Bronca

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
to which I say, hooray and hurrah.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Which I will now drink on podcast form.

03:18.000 --> 03:28.000
So, there was a case where there are these dead children.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Don't mention dead children around, Jeff.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
There were these dead children and they wanted to know who killed them

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
and there were pubic hairs of course everywhere

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
and the pubic hairs matched this guy who lived with the family.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
I'm not laughing at the death of the children.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
I'm just laughing at the volume of forensic files that just desensitizes you

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
and that's what you're in the market for is desensitization.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
You keep making these jokes about people's haircuts and stuff and they're crying.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
And there's just pubic hairs everywhere and they were like,

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
well, fuck, well, the guy lived with them.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
They were like, dude, we found your pubic hairs in the kid's room

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
and the guy's like, so fucking, I lived there.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Pubic hairs get around.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
He's got to be right, right?

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
And that's the guy.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
This forensics guy is like, he's doing his interview

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
and he goes, so, we had to come up with a new science.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
So I went home and I vacuumed my whole house really well

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
and I tell you, the house has never been cleaner.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
And he stopped and I was like, that guy's one moment of joy

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
for that whole year.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
But he vacuumed his whole house and then he vacuumed it regular times

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
and counted the pubic hairs.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
Like, he had to figure out how, can you imagine being that guy's daughter?

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
What are you doing, dad?

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
He's like, you know, the guy is like in the middle of a science

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
that needs to be like, it's got peer review and stuff.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
So he's like at home and he's like, this could help bring a murderer to justice.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
And it's like, I need to make sure that I don't while eating breakfast

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
or watching television or anything.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
I never engage in any activities that go beyond the average amount of pubic hair affectation.

05:30.000 --> 05:37.000
I don't want to have a crazy like dance party

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
and take off my pants and shake my pelvis around

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
because what if they find that out and then they're like,

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
because he had to find out how far does the average pubic hair go, you know?

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
And it turns out pubic hairs travel or migrate

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
primarily on sock surfaces.

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah, you step on a pubic hair, you're smuggling pubes at that point.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
But more than hairs off your head or hairs off your arm?

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
No, no, no, not more than hairs off your head, no.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Just enough that there's some pubic hairs.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
If you have a kid, some of your pubic hairs are in your kid's bedroom,

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
but not so many and then they started getting into the minutia of like,

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
yeah, but these were fresh, moist pubic hairs.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
But those stick to socks more than any other kind.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
And then the forensic guy was talking about other pubic hairs

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
he was finding in his kid's bedroom.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
Were dry and had been bitten by a mite larvae, you know?

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
But the world this guy lives in, the world his children live in.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
But this pubic hair was holding a picture of today's New York Times.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Was he acquitted? This guy could offer to you.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
So the guy that works for the forensic side,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I think he went to jail after the whole thing was over.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
His kids like filed charges.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
I was trying to save a life. No, everyone's dead.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
You're just trying to be the best pubic hair detector.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
And you need to stop. It's like a beautiful mind, I think.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
That's hard work being the world's best pubic hair detective.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Anyways.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
Oh, and I was also thinking because, okay, so while he was talking about the pubic hair migration,

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
you saw this black and white footage of people, their heads were out of frame,

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
but you just saw it like it was like a lockdown camera shot

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
and then just like different family members,

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
like different aged people putting on socks and taking them off

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
and like walking around and like just walking through frame.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
And then there was another case that it was pubic hair reliant.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
And so they used that footage again.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
And Cody and I were like, oh my God, it's the pubic hair migration footage.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
And then also that required vacuuming.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
And it was like, oh, that's the same vacuum cleaner.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Oh, they're cutting up and looking through the layers of the vacuum bag.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
So I was thinking like they must be so stoked at forensic files when a new murder happens

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
and it uses all the elements of their stock footage.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Their budget's cut in half.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
Like someone got strangled with pubic hair by a vacuum cleaner salesman.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
But then you get a guy that's like a producer that was about to get fired

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
and he starts committing pubic hair murders.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
Yeah, just to get to drive the budget down.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
It's like firemen starting fires.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
Yeah, the forensics files budget is too high.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
I don't know about, well, yeah, it doesn't make any sense.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
He starts committing non-pubic hair murders.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
That's what it is.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
The network says like, look, your show's on autopilot, man.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Budgetarily, you've got it all knocked out.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
I can do it.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
You take the pubic hair footage.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
You take the bloody knife.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
You take the lady coming home from shopping.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
And you put this thing together, you say, murder.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
And then you get an episode.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
And then the producer was like, fuck, there goes my kid's pool.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
And then he like...

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
He was building his kid his own pool.

09:24.000 --> 09:35.000
So he removes all of his pubic hair and becomes the alopecia strangler.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
And then there's an episode about it.

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
And he's like, yeah, it's like a cool movie about that guy's double life.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
And you're on his side because it's like a black comedy,

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
like a dark anti kind of thing.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
How do you catch the alopecia strangler?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
What's that forensic files like?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Well, he slips up.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
You know, I don't know.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
He gets caught by his own people.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Nobody on those shows, by the way, they never get caught by the cops.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
It's always...

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
A phone call.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
A tip.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
The drinking game with forensic files.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
The big one is like, and then police received a call that they've been waiting for.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Then police received a tip.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
He changed everything.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
A guy just told me he is the alopecia strangler.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
It's always like a guy in prison that's like, hey, this guy I've been in prison with

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
murdered like 90 people before you caught him jaywalking.

10:21.000 --> 10:28.000
And then they let the three people they put in prison for the crime go at the end.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
And they're all gold and gray and they fall down as they're leaving the prison from the

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
weight of the $8 they got from the state.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Dan, if you ever...

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
There was like a crazy one where I was like, I kept rewinding it because I was like, wait,

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
are they trying to...

10:43.000 --> 10:50.000
This episode of forensic files is trying to get away with murder because there was a woman

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
in it who went to police and said, I think I know...

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
I work at a massage parlor and a lot of these guys get pretty chatty.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
And I think this guy is saying some weird shit.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I'd wear a wire for you if you wanted.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
And they were like, no, that's too dangerous.

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
And then she called them later and was like, yeah, that guy just confessed I should have

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
been wearing a wire.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
And they're like, okay, now record them and get them to do it again.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
And she tried and it didn't work.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
And then the guy came and stabbed her after work.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
And I was like, oh, so rewind it to when she was...

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
That's why they made that big, weird deal about how she came to them.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
It was like, we told her it was too dangerous.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Like, no, you didn't.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
You fucking jumped on it and made her some amateur sleuth or whatever, man.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
And I was like, come on, man, forensic files, not forensic files, the police involved.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
Forensic files, I'm sure they killed people too.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
You know if it made the difference between them getting to do more forensic files and

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
getting canceled that they'd kill somebody.

12:00.000 --> 12:06.000
If that show tells you one thing, man, it's inside all of us.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
You released the beast.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
We watched the Purge movies this weekend.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
All two of the ones available at home.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Purge 2, definitely better than Purge 1.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
That's a lot like, you know, turds with peanuts in them are better than regular turds.

12:25.000 --> 12:32.000
But the Purge, just because I don't know what you're measuring by peanuts, it's gross.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
It's a gross image.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
You don't want to think about it, but technically speaking...

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
Spencer, if you had to choose between turds or turds with peanuts, what are you taking?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Are people swallowing these peanuts whole?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
How does that work?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
You got to chew those peanuts.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
How would you tell the difference between any other thing that was in your poop?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
They would taste like peanuts.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
You wouldn't say it's like...

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Is this one of those things?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
It's like corn, corn in the cellulose.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Corn is different than peanuts, man.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
That's what I'm saying.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Whatever.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I didn't get a lot of sleep.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
Let me tell you what happened when I was trying to go to sleep last night.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Great.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
I was going to go to sleep.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I'm laying down, laying down in my bed.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I'm relaxing.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
I got a fart.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
And I fart.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
And I just shit all over the place.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Just so much shit.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I'm lightheaded.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
And I'm getting dizzy from all this shit.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And I can't move.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
And I'm just paralyzed.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
You shit so much.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
You depleted your blood flow to your brain.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Yeah.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
It was terrifying.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
And then I woke up.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
And it was sleep paralysis.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
And I was completely dry.

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
But it was really terrifying because I thought I was literally shitting my brains out.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
And then I couldn't get back to sleep for like hours.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
But you had not shit yourself.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
No.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
I didn't even have to shit.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
It was part of the confusion and the fear.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
As soon as you were able to move, you started for the bathroom and you were like,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
wait, wait, it's all good.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
I guess I'll lay down and what I was convinced was my shit.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Yeah.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
I really had to convince myself it wasn't shit.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
And it was not ideal from that point onward.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
Didn't get a lot of sleep.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
I had another dream where I was like walking through dog shit too.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I don't know.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
It was fine.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
What do you think all that shit related dreams signifies?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
It's really weird.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I've never had that before.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
It was a really weird situation in my life.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Does anybody here know like dream analysis?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
It's a bullshit.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Well, there you go.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
I ate a whole pizza.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
My body might have just been working that out.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Large, medium, small?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
What size pizza?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
It was a large Hawaiian pizza.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
A whole large Hawaiian?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Yeah.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Okay.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
That's heroic.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Yeah.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
You deserve to dream about shitting yourself to death.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
That's the thing.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
My body was just terrified.

15:09.000 --> 15:17.000
I ate something that really had me going in the fart department, which I refused to call

15:17.000 --> 15:26.000
the department because I don't want to get too used to this stuff.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
I was like, really, I went to Cliff's Edge over, it doesn't matter where I went.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
It's a nice restaurant.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
They got a back patio.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
I haven't really seen Cody all week.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
For a long time, they got a holiday weekend together.

15:41.000 --> 15:47.000
Went out in a back patio at one of LA's fine summer breeze restaurants and had some silly

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
food for artsy farts.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
Something in one of them, I don't know if I'm lactose intolerant and there was like

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
a milk fish or something.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
I was farting so much.

16:02.000 --> 16:11.000
With Cody, I went through a whole, with McGathey, we decided at the outset, let's not fart

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
in front of each other.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
I've been doing that for a couple of girlfriends.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
A zero fart policy.

16:17.000 --> 16:24.000
I got the idea from Sarah Silverman, her relationship with Jimmy Kimmel, which she was in when I was

16:24.000 --> 16:31.000
working with her, she said at one point, I don't fart in front of Jimmy and vice versa.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
We don't do that.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
I was like, really, what?

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Don't you think that's dishonest and unnatural?

16:37.000 --> 16:44.000
She's like, is it dishonest to not fart all over the person you say you love?

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
What are you telling them with that expression?

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
They're like your hillbilly brother or you're shocked if the sex goes away or whatever.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
I was like, okay, that's a totally different perspective and I've never even entertained

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
it.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.400
Then I looked back at previous relationships and I was like, God, yeah, man, you really

17:01.400 --> 17:10.000
get programmed by your kind of family's class system or their aesthetic.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
There's a lot of stuff you don't even second guess.

17:12.000 --> 17:18.200
I would always celebrate becoming intimate with a woman by really starting to fart a

17:18.200 --> 17:19.200
lot.

17:19.200 --> 17:25.200
So I started tapering it off and thinking, yeah, why don't you just go in the other room

17:25.200 --> 17:26.200
if you had a fart so bad?

17:26.200 --> 17:30.200
What's so funny about poopy farts?

17:30.200 --> 17:31.200
Stop it.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.200
So you and Cody are-

17:32.200 --> 17:38.200
But Cody kind of was swinging back the other way because she was like, but it's like a

17:38.200 --> 17:39.200
pendulum.

17:39.200 --> 17:43.000
With McGathey, and I don't think it wasn't like McGathey's demand, she just liked the

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
idea too.

17:44.000 --> 17:50.200
I think we just really never farted in front of each other.

17:50.200 --> 17:53.400
Cody, I'm letting him rip a little bit.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.640
A little bit.

17:56.640 --> 18:01.560
Like I'm pushing the envelope.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.000
You're trying to blow her mind?

18:03.000 --> 18:08.600
Well, it's like I'll do it.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.600
Name a key.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.600
F sharp.

18:10.600 --> 18:11.600
Merep.

18:11.600 --> 18:16.600
I feel like splitting the differences like you do one and then you go like, uh-oh.

18:16.600 --> 18:20.600
I was like, what was that?

18:20.600 --> 18:26.600
I think a mouse was moving a dresser.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.600
Back to the 50s kind of.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.800
I think it's duck season.

18:31.800 --> 18:38.440
Have you done this long enough for the experiment to prove itself that affects sex life?

18:38.440 --> 18:42.640
So far, still, I'm still creepy.

18:42.640 --> 18:50.640
Yeah, no, it hasn't really, I don't think it's changing anything.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.160
But I'm going by laughter.

18:52.160 --> 18:56.760
Like if it's not going to make her laugh, then I'm not going to, I think that's a thing.

18:56.760 --> 19:00.280
It's not about whether or not they don't throw anything at you.

19:00.280 --> 19:07.240
It should be if they stop laughing, then maybe wait until it's funny again.

19:07.240 --> 19:11.960
So I, like, a couple nights ago, I was like, I'm always more awake than her.

19:11.960 --> 19:17.120
And so then I'll like, I do one, and she'll go like, that sounded so sharp.

19:17.120 --> 19:21.200
I'll talk about it for a little bit, yeah, it was really sharp.

19:21.200 --> 19:26.640
And then like 10 minutes later, I'll do another one and it's like, I was like, did you hear

19:26.640 --> 19:27.640
that?

19:27.640 --> 19:28.640
Yeah.

19:28.640 --> 19:31.720
All right, so then you pull back.

19:31.720 --> 19:35.480
Then the next one, you go in the basement.

19:35.480 --> 19:41.320
But is there a blue sky fart where you fart and it completely makes everything amazing?

19:41.320 --> 19:46.320
Well, I did one today that I swear, yeah, I mean, you've had, like today I did one and

19:46.320 --> 19:47.960
she was just sound asleep.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.800
Like I was like, I'm just doing it.

19:50.800 --> 19:55.280
It was like, I was sitting up in bed playing some iPad game and it was like building and

19:55.280 --> 19:59.840
like, and then I kind of laid down for a bit and was like snuggling and, and then I was

19:59.840 --> 20:04.920
just like, I'm just going to, I'm just going to see what's, what's going on here.

20:04.920 --> 20:10.040
And I swear, this is my actual estimate of the length, like, and this, maybe it won't

20:10.040 --> 20:16.760
sound identical, but this is my actual not exaggerating estimate of the length of the

20:16.760 --> 20:17.760
duration.

20:17.760 --> 20:18.760
Whoa.

20:18.760 --> 20:19.760
What?

20:19.760 --> 20:20.760
No.

20:20.760 --> 20:21.760
No.

20:21.760 --> 20:43.120
And then I just kind of like hung there, like in silence, like, Dan, Dan, will you marry

20:43.120 --> 20:44.120
me?

20:44.120 --> 20:45.120
That's amazing.

20:45.120 --> 20:49.560
I went out and I touched her on the shoulder because I wanted to know, and she was like,

20:49.560 --> 20:59.560
oh, well, and I, and I was like, I love you, I love you too, like, so she didn't hear it.

20:59.560 --> 21:00.840
Stockholm syndrome.

21:00.840 --> 21:06.520
That's an amazing fart.

21:06.520 --> 21:12.800
There was a guy on forensic files who pronounced the word personality, um, personnatally.

21:12.800 --> 21:20.760
The people on there are so crazy with their crazy hair, there should be a, there should

21:20.760 --> 21:24.920
be a, uh, and it's also fun to watch classic forensic files because like today we saw one

21:24.920 --> 21:28.920
where they fucking, they took 25 minutes because they were so scared we wouldn't know what

21:28.920 --> 21:30.320
GPS was.

21:30.320 --> 21:37.040
They're like, but, but police didn't have to follow Andrew Kressinger.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.800
They didn't have to commercial break.

21:39.800 --> 21:44.800
They were like, what, what, and then it comes back and the whole act was, was like, high

21:44.800 --> 21:50.760
above the earth, 30 miles in outer space, and it was like, like, they went, there was

21:50.760 --> 21:52.280
like, there were eight satellites.

21:52.280 --> 21:54.200
I mean, I learned how GPS works.

21:54.200 --> 21:57.680
I didn't, I didn't need to, but they didn't know we knew what it was.

21:57.680 --> 22:03.960
They called it the global positioning system or GPS and they took the, the first letters

22:03.960 --> 22:08.760
of each word and animated them going up into the word GPS.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.080
This was a first time thing for them.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.920
They, they were explaining how they were using it to catch a killer.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.960
That sounds like slow news day for them again.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.920
By the way, if you ever kill a little girl, um, and the cops say to you, and we're not

22:20.920 --> 22:25.000
saying you should, we're not saying you should, but here's something to, here's a pitfall.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.480
Here's, here's, here's, here's a way the police are going to abuse their power.

22:28.480 --> 22:29.480
Okay.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.480
Here's three nevers.

22:30.480 --> 22:31.480
Here's three nevers.

22:31.480 --> 22:32.480
I'm killing a little girl.

22:32.480 --> 22:37.080
If they come to you and they say like they, they go like, look, congratulations.

22:37.080 --> 22:43.080
We know you killed that little girl, uh, and you got away with it for now, but you know

22:43.080 --> 22:45.280
that grave's too shallow.

22:45.280 --> 22:50.680
You know animals are going to dig it up and then it's just a matter of time.

22:50.680 --> 22:58.840
Don't go drive to the shallow grave, dig it up, take the body, put it in your trunk,

22:58.840 --> 23:06.080
rub the fibers around, drive it to another place to dig a big, deep grave and cover

23:06.080 --> 23:14.600
it up, put a flower on it and then come back home and measure twice, cut once, you know.

23:14.600 --> 23:18.640
There's a good chance the cops aren't busting out the, that shallow grave's going to give

23:18.640 --> 23:22.960
your, your kid's body to the dingos soon.

23:22.960 --> 23:25.600
Like they're not, they're not leaning on that until they're desperate.

23:25.600 --> 23:29.440
So you know, take three years and go change that body.

23:29.440 --> 23:34.720
I think, I think part of the fun of killing children is like right, righting that wave

23:34.720 --> 23:37.400
of how, how shallow should I make this grave?

23:37.400 --> 23:40.280
Just for the fucking action.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.280
It's true.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.280
Just for the fucking adrenaline.

23:42.280 --> 23:43.280
Yeah.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.280
Like six feet, no.

23:44.280 --> 23:45.280
How about three and a half?

23:45.280 --> 23:47.360
And you know, you're thinking like, oh, Jeff, that's crazy.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.240
Why would you kill a kid just for the thrill?

23:49.240 --> 23:53.640
And we're not, again, we're not saying kill kids, uh, what we're saying is if you do,

23:53.640 --> 23:57.360
you're not doing it to become senator.

23:57.360 --> 24:00.200
You're not doing it to make money.

24:00.200 --> 24:01.200
You're doing it.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.200
You're doing it.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.560
I mean, so if you're going to do it.

24:03.560 --> 24:07.160
Like I say, do it, do it, do it, ride the edge, ride that edge.

24:07.160 --> 24:08.160
Right, right.

24:08.160 --> 24:11.200
Barry, that kid's six inches underneath some boots.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.920
It's point break.

24:12.920 --> 24:16.960
Fear causes hesitation, hesitation causes your worst fears to come true.

24:16.960 --> 24:21.740
I'm saying Barry a kid, just three inches.

24:21.740 --> 24:24.520
And hey, while we're at it, same topic kind of related.

24:24.520 --> 24:29.080
If you're running for president and you're a fascist, like, uh, let go ahead, use the,

24:29.080 --> 24:35.360
use the original artwork from the meme, like with the, uh, anti-Semitic, uh, star of David

24:35.360 --> 24:36.360
on the thing.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.360
Did he see the thing?

24:38.360 --> 24:40.760
I missed the whole thing, but there was a thing.

24:40.760 --> 24:46.560
There was a Trump did another meme, like the last one he, remember, he just finds him

24:46.560 --> 24:51.120
and then he, he's like, indisputably like, he has no help with his Twitter account.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.320
He has no staff.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.920
I have to say, I think he does.

24:54.920 --> 24:57.640
I think this is all, it can't be that's unpremeditated.

24:57.640 --> 25:01.080
Well, there's a scary thing because there were, you know, you read sometimes articles

25:01.080 --> 25:04.920
about his strategy, about how he tests stuff, he uses the internet to test stuff.

25:04.920 --> 25:09.120
So if that were true, what if there were multiple tiers to his testing?

25:09.120 --> 25:13.960
So like, what if he did have people like posting crazy, like anti-Semitic, like racist shit

25:13.960 --> 25:18.680
into like super right of right wing, like message boards, seeing how it played with the

25:18.680 --> 25:23.800
hustler magazine crowd, then like, like flip, pumping a little air into it and bumping it

25:23.800 --> 25:28.760
up, subreddit by subreddit, and then all of a sudden he throws it out there and everyone's

25:28.760 --> 25:33.160
like, these statistics are all wrong about black people in crime and he's like, oh, sorry

25:33.160 --> 25:35.160
about that.

25:35.160 --> 25:40.160
Like, I know this won't blow up in my face because it's been like built up on like layers

25:40.160 --> 25:41.160
of sediment.

25:41.160 --> 25:42.240
I don't know.

25:42.240 --> 25:49.640
But whatever the case is, he tweeted a meme, he tweeted a meme.

25:49.640 --> 25:58.080
It was like, historic Hillary and whatever, she's made history and then there was a, and

25:58.080 --> 26:02.960
then it was her head cut out, not cut off, cut out, like, and it was like over just a

26:02.960 --> 26:05.320
big pile of money, it was just money in the background.

26:05.320 --> 26:10.680
And then there was a big red star of David, no matter how you slice it, just a big red

26:10.680 --> 26:18.400
star of David, and inside the star of David it said, you know, most corrupt ever, most

26:18.400 --> 26:19.760
corrupt candidate ever.

26:19.760 --> 26:20.760
Something like that.

26:20.760 --> 26:24.560
It was like the 20% more beef kind of like starburst thing.

26:24.560 --> 26:33.720
The star was a star of David and then people were like, what the fuck, like, holy shit.

26:33.720 --> 26:40.000
And then they deleted that and like switched it and it was a red circle, and then everyone

26:40.000 --> 26:44.760
was like, you can still see two of the six points from the star underneath the peeking

26:44.760 --> 26:46.680
out from under the red circle.

26:46.680 --> 26:55.720
I don't know, I just, I mean, just as I overheard a lady say in a candle store once, amaze

26:55.720 --> 27:03.080
balls, amaze balls, amaze balls.

27:03.080 --> 27:08.800
I guess she's only seen it in print, the word amaze balls.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.040
She thought it was Italian.

27:12.040 --> 27:18.920
She had what you'd call personality.

27:18.920 --> 27:22.880
So yeah, with those two things leaked, so if you're going to kill a little girl, bury

27:22.880 --> 27:27.360
her shallow, if you're going to run for president and be a Nazi, to have Hitler's speeches

27:27.360 --> 27:33.280
next to your bed, and fucking start tweeting those anti-Semitic tweets, there's no other

27:33.280 --> 27:39.360
reason to become president as a fascist, other one to see if we can get this started again.

27:39.360 --> 27:48.640
News ready, let's get the way back machine going, 1932.

27:48.640 --> 27:51.720
That's when we start making money, by the way.

27:51.720 --> 27:52.720
Who does?

27:52.720 --> 27:56.880
America during fucking big ass wars, because we've gotten so good at manufacturing.

27:56.880 --> 28:04.200
No, but that presumes that we're like the non-interventionist country that scores after

28:04.200 --> 28:05.880
the war has already run its course.

28:05.880 --> 28:10.080
You know, isolationist America during World War II, fucking cha-ching.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.320
Yeah, but we're not isolationists anymore at all.

28:12.320 --> 28:20.880
We're going to be, we're building a wall.

28:20.880 --> 28:24.240
We're currently at war with the rest of the universe right now.

28:24.240 --> 28:29.960
That's another way of saying isolationism, fighting a war on all fronts.

28:29.960 --> 28:34.680
No, rethink that sentence.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.120
Why am I on trial?

28:36.120 --> 28:38.760
There's a Nazi running for president, focus on him.

28:38.760 --> 28:46.040
He's not a Nazi, he's not Hitler, he's Mussolini, he's a blowhard asshole.

28:46.040 --> 28:50.760
Another regular segment on this show is Jeff's surprisingly pro-Hitler thoughts.

28:50.760 --> 29:03.680
I'm not pro-Hitler, I'm saying look, he has some good ideas, hear him out, listen to him.

29:03.680 --> 29:09.920
Yeah, as Proops points out on one of his podcasts, Smartest Man in the World, it's like Hitler

29:09.920 --> 29:11.560
had a plan.

29:11.560 --> 29:15.920
He wasn't just fucking winging it, Mussolini was more of a kind of a winging it and it's

29:15.920 --> 29:17.840
appealing to the lowest common denominator.

29:17.840 --> 29:22.480
Let's not praise Hitler just because Trump hasn't been elected yet.

29:22.480 --> 29:29.000
I'm not sure Trump can fucking come up with a plan, it's hopefully in a post-Hitler world

29:29.000 --> 29:32.960
we're getting a little bit in the way, like there's more people going and there's more

29:32.960 --> 29:33.960
internet.

29:33.960 --> 29:39.480
We're going like, are you about to be a Hitler and he's like, no, I'm huge.

29:39.480 --> 29:43.720
Saying that Trump is a low-level Hitler is not praising Hitler, it's not.

29:43.720 --> 29:48.080
I'm saying, well, who cares, who's praising Hitler or praising Trump or whatever.

29:48.080 --> 29:53.160
The important thing is that fascist dictators, they are, it's like when you put your bread

29:53.160 --> 29:59.680
out on a counter, like is the mold that grows on it a genius because it found the bread?

29:59.680 --> 30:06.120
It's like opportunity breeds fascism.

30:06.120 --> 30:10.960
When countries are laid low and when the economy is fucked, when cultures start to shift so

30:10.960 --> 30:16.040
fast that there's a huge section of the population that's kind of getting disoriented and starting

30:16.040 --> 30:26.480
to worry, they revert to this instinct for authoritarianism.

30:26.480 --> 30:31.320
Even in history class, economic depression, recession, all these things, it's a potting

30:31.320 --> 30:36.720
soil for dictators, in particular fascists who want to nationalize everything.

30:36.720 --> 30:39.760
They pick a scapegoat and they go, what about these guys, how come they're making so much

30:39.760 --> 30:43.760
money or they're coming in and they're eating all our food stamps or whatever.

30:43.760 --> 30:47.040
You pick somebody and you go like, what if we all just like-

30:47.040 --> 30:50.280
But think about people eating food stamps, it's like just because we're called food stamps,

30:50.280 --> 30:51.680
doesn't mean they're actual food.

30:51.680 --> 30:57.880
No, it's just another reason to build a wall even higher, man.

30:57.880 --> 31:02.040
The important thing to know is that when we have these conversations, you got to hand

31:02.040 --> 31:06.920
it to them or it's working because of us.

31:06.920 --> 31:11.680
We need to really make sure that we don't blow this story off after he loses the election

31:11.680 --> 31:16.080
and there's crazy race gangs running out in the streets going, I don't know, I got all

31:16.080 --> 31:26.600
amped up about this, I guess I don't care about politics no more, I'm still unemployed.

31:26.600 --> 31:34.320
We need to understand, it's us, the orange guy with the hair, Spencer points out he's

31:34.320 --> 31:39.640
been running for president for 38 years, in one form or another he's always been saying

31:39.640 --> 31:43.680
someone pay attention to me and then that birther thing started happening, it's an opportunistic

31:43.680 --> 31:44.680
infection.

31:44.680 --> 31:49.960
It's like a gaping wound on your arm as a country, as we all are worldwide, like the

31:49.960 --> 31:55.320
economy is like, we're in vulnerable places and so it's happening, this sentiment, it's

31:55.320 --> 32:00.440
like, oh, I don't want these people with the towels and these things with the browns and

32:00.440 --> 32:04.960
then they're taking the jarbs and then they're thinking, the tax is in the things and why

32:04.960 --> 32:08.280
can't we have more guns and they want to wall around the thing and they put the wall and

32:08.280 --> 32:11.120
they can do it and they're like, I can't do this.

32:11.120 --> 32:16.200
It's starting, it's like those rumbles of like, it's going to turn into, it could turn

32:16.200 --> 32:25.440
into ugliness, could turn into ugliness, but what was it, wait, wait, wait, oh, here's

32:25.440 --> 32:29.960
the thing, this is the thing that terrified me when I was putting on my pants today.

32:29.960 --> 32:33.120
My dick is huge!

32:33.120 --> 32:37.440
I was thinking, and this is going to sound like a bit, but it's like, as far as the ratio

32:37.440 --> 32:42.600
between how much like a bit it sounds and how actually scary I think it is, it's like,

32:42.600 --> 32:45.680
I've never said anything with this high a ratio.

32:45.680 --> 32:52.480
I'm not even sure how to phrase the question.

32:52.480 --> 33:01.840
What percentage of Hitler being able to come into power, what percentage of it do you think

33:01.840 --> 33:10.880
might have been your average like, like kind of on the bubble, like constantly putting

33:10.880 --> 33:18.960
his foot in his mouth, straight, white like Jim Belushi, Dan Harmon kind of like, like,

33:18.960 --> 33:22.240
like, like, like, like, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, I was always offended, like, because

33:22.240 --> 33:25.560
I was just thinking, I just found myself thinking while I was putting on my pants, I just like,

33:25.560 --> 33:28.740
heard something else that Trump said, or I was thinking about that start, David's thinking,

33:28.740 --> 33:31.580
I was like, the thought went through my head of like,

33:31.580 --> 33:36.420
well, it's good to know I'm not as racist as somebody.

33:36.420 --> 33:41.100
You know, it's good to know I'm not the biggest

33:41.100 --> 33:42.900
fucking doofus in the world.

33:42.900 --> 33:47.100
And I was like, I'm back, in the 90s,

33:47.100 --> 33:49.540
being feminist, for instance, was as easy

33:49.540 --> 33:51.740
as expecting more from women.

33:51.740 --> 33:57.700
It changed over the years.

33:57.700 --> 34:01.340
It was like, you're like, you go, girl.

34:01.340 --> 34:05.180
That was like a fucking, you were like, yeah, you can do it.

34:05.180 --> 34:08.940
It was like, things change, and then you get like,

34:08.940 --> 34:13.300
so I wonder how many people are like,

34:13.300 --> 34:15.780
with the Trump phenomenon, I wonder if that was something

34:15.780 --> 34:19.660
that could happen in Germany, like, back in those days

34:19.660 --> 34:22.180
where people were like, oh, finally, somebody

34:22.180 --> 34:24.220
that makes me sound like I like Jews.

34:29.220 --> 34:31.300
Like, finally, my daughter will stop

34:31.300 --> 34:34.900
rolling her eyes at everything I say at the dinner table.

34:34.900 --> 34:38.220
You know, like, and I was like, I had this shutter.

34:38.220 --> 34:40.420
I was like, wait, is that the fucking tyranny?

34:40.420 --> 34:41.260
Is that what it is?

34:41.260 --> 34:45.060
Is that what, is that the wildfire that catches fire

34:45.060 --> 34:46.660
and burns up King's Landing?

34:46.660 --> 34:50.340
Like, is that the, it's the actual, just like,

34:50.340 --> 34:54.380
it's the oxygen, it's the styrofoam peanuts,

34:54.380 --> 34:57.620
it's the shit that coats the film in Glorious Basterds,

34:57.620 --> 35:01.980
it's the actual accelerant, isn't like the fucking like,

35:01.980 --> 35:05.940
hard, it takes work to be a fucking redneck stump hump

35:05.940 --> 35:08.580
and fucking like, active like, racist,

35:08.580 --> 35:11.500
or you're like, I'm gonna hit you with a stick,

35:11.500 --> 35:16.860
you see your color, like, geez, that guy is committed.

35:16.860 --> 35:19.740
The like, like, like, what about the fucking mob

35:19.740 --> 35:23.060
around that person that's like, I know that's bad

35:23.060 --> 35:25.180
and I wanna be liked, I know that's bad

35:25.180 --> 35:27.140
and I don't wanna be a bad person, I don't know.

35:27.140 --> 35:29.700
Like, like, like, what is the phenomenon that might,

35:29.700 --> 35:31.820
you know, like, we have to be on guard against that

35:31.820 --> 35:34.060
because like, I just like, feel that in my soul,

35:34.060 --> 35:35.900
like, there's these things eating away at the edges

35:35.900 --> 35:38.740
where I'm like, why am I trying so hard?

35:38.740 --> 35:40.220
Why, why do I try?

35:40.220 --> 35:42.380
Why, well, they're like, like, like, like, you know,

35:42.380 --> 35:44.140
and it's like, there's important answers

35:44.140 --> 35:47.420
to those questions we all have to ask.

35:47.420 --> 35:50.380
So when you put on your pants next time,

35:50.380 --> 35:52.500
please join me at these heights of thought.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.980
Just asking the specific questions,

35:55.980 --> 35:57.260
I wanna recap the question.

35:57.260 --> 36:01.060
How many people in pre-Nazi Germany do you think

36:01.060 --> 36:05.500
were a little bit like, that became Hitler supporters,

36:05.500 --> 36:08.420
were anti-Hitler in their conversation,

36:08.420 --> 36:11.740
but then in some weird, Poloric Valve part of them

36:11.740 --> 36:16.740
were like, they were like, oh, that guy's a goofball,

36:16.740 --> 36:18.820
he'll take all the pressure off me.

36:18.820 --> 36:19.660
You know, like.

36:19.660 --> 36:22.340
At that time, there was a lot of parties vying for power

36:22.340 --> 36:24.260
and the Weimar Republic was falling to pieces

36:24.260 --> 36:25.100
and there was always provisions.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.660
There was so many parties vying for power

36:26.660 --> 36:29.100
that they had to call it the Weimar Republic.

36:30.180 --> 36:32.140
Cause they were like, vying is like, all right,

36:32.140 --> 36:33.500
keep going, I'm sorry.

36:33.500 --> 36:35.140
Schrab hasn't been here and they're like,

36:35.140 --> 36:39.540
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36:39.540 --> 36:43.900
But there was a bunch of asshole, meathead, bully thugs

36:43.900 --> 36:45.460
that were running around with brown shirts on

36:45.460 --> 36:48.180
and kicking everybody's ass and blaming the economy,

36:48.180 --> 36:49.860
cause the economy was fucked.

36:49.860 --> 36:51.780
There was this giant depression going on

36:51.780 --> 36:54.020
and they're blaming it all on foreigners,

36:54.020 --> 36:56.060
which is what you see going on in all of Europe,

36:56.060 --> 37:00.340
also here, and then at some point,

37:00.340 --> 37:04.740
I think like, when this certain really radical party

37:04.740 --> 37:06.660
starts saying like, we'll kick your ass

37:06.660 --> 37:08.860
if you don't agree with us that Jews are the problem

37:08.860 --> 37:12.100
and all this shit and like really extreme stuff.

37:12.100 --> 37:13.100
I think a lot of people are like, look,

37:13.100 --> 37:15.980
I would just like the economy to get back on track

37:15.980 --> 37:18.980
and we'll start following anybody that really has answers

37:18.980 --> 37:22.220
to getting the economy going, which is all baloney.

37:22.220 --> 37:23.740
It's all complete bullshit.

37:23.740 --> 37:27.980
It's not as simple as immigration or leaving the EU.

37:27.980 --> 37:30.420
It's like, it's crazy talk.

37:30.420 --> 37:32.900
But I think that people want simple answers

37:32.900 --> 37:36.540
when the economy is fucked and they're working class people

37:36.540 --> 37:39.020
and they will listen to Lunatic billionaires

37:39.020 --> 37:40.580
who say like, I'm on your side.

37:40.580 --> 37:42.140
They're not fucking on your side.

37:42.140 --> 37:43.300
They have nothing to do with you.

37:43.300 --> 37:44.740
They don't even know who you are.

37:44.740 --> 37:45.740
Also, everything they're saying,

37:45.740 --> 37:47.260
it makes no sense at all.

37:48.900 --> 37:53.900
The answer is, will average people start becoming okay

37:54.180 --> 37:55.500
with radical ideas?

37:55.500 --> 37:58.380
Yes, absolutely they do.

37:58.380 --> 38:00.900
And what's happening all over the world right now

38:00.900 --> 38:04.300
in major democracies, including ours,

38:04.300 --> 38:06.180
and all over like France and England,

38:06.180 --> 38:10.940
like fascism, right wing extremism, racism is on the rise.

38:10.940 --> 38:12.780
And it's gaining footholds.

38:12.780 --> 38:15.780
And that's the places that are collapsing first.

38:15.780 --> 38:16.740
The banks are closing,

38:16.740 --> 38:19.740
well then there's a swastika like five feet from there,

38:19.740 --> 38:21.100
you know, like in Greece and stuff.

38:21.100 --> 38:24.380
Like the national socialism is, yeah.

38:24.380 --> 38:27.460
The average person in Germany didn't hate Jews,

38:27.460 --> 38:29.380
but the average person was okay with like,

38:29.380 --> 38:31.140
kind of going along with the flow.

38:31.140 --> 38:35.260
And also like, Germany is a huge country,

38:35.260 --> 38:37.260
full of different neighbors that believed

38:37.260 --> 38:39.580
in different things, followed different parties.

38:39.580 --> 38:41.900
Also at some point, fear comes into it.

38:41.900 --> 38:44.860
The idea that speaking up for what you believe

38:44.860 --> 38:46.740
actually becomes illegal.

38:46.740 --> 38:49.180
And that's the scary thing is that right now,

38:49.180 --> 38:52.540
we're still like, we can still talk shit about Trump

38:52.540 --> 38:56.020
and talk shit about what like the direction things are going

38:56.020 --> 38:57.780
and it can still be comedy.

38:57.780 --> 39:00.860
That might go away before too long.

39:00.860 --> 39:03.260
Like that's the real danger is that it's actually illegal.

39:03.260 --> 39:04.260
Certainly if you're out in the fringe

39:04.260 --> 39:07.540
and you're for instance, I don't know if that lady

39:07.540 --> 39:10.020
who was painting Trump with a little dick or whatever

39:10.020 --> 39:12.340
and some guy runs up and smacks him in the face.

39:12.340 --> 39:15.860
Yeah, I mean, it's like, yeah, it was like,

39:15.860 --> 39:19.820
so what's the takeaway?

39:19.820 --> 39:21.780
I think it's that in the coming years,

39:21.780 --> 39:24.220
I don't think that Trump is going to get elected,

39:24.220 --> 39:25.260
but I think-

39:25.260 --> 39:27.460
I don't think that you should be that comfortable saying that.

39:27.460 --> 39:29.540
I think it's very, very likely.

39:29.540 --> 39:30.380
Jesus Christ.

39:30.380 --> 39:31.780
Well, okay, put a pin in that.

39:31.780 --> 39:34.260
People hate Hillary so much for whatever their reasons

39:34.260 --> 39:35.300
are right or wrong.

39:35.300 --> 39:39.020
People despise her and will vote against somebody

39:39.020 --> 39:41.140
for whatever they believe about her.

39:41.140 --> 39:45.980
And they will also vote for this incredible quack.

39:45.980 --> 39:47.060
They will vote for him.

39:47.060 --> 39:48.980
Well, I think the easy thing to say though

39:48.980 --> 39:53.060
is disregard what you think the results of the election

39:53.060 --> 39:56.060
might be because in either case,

39:56.060 --> 39:59.140
like what's clear from this process,

39:59.140 --> 40:04.140
like this fat orange manic bullet that shot

40:04.180 --> 40:07.620
or like squirted out of a volcano,

40:07.620 --> 40:11.700
like it represents magma underneath

40:11.700 --> 40:15.940
and it's not, well, this is where my lack

40:15.940 --> 40:19.020
of a geology degree will probably break this metaphor down,

40:19.020 --> 40:26.020
but it doesn't mean, oh, look at that really scary volcano

40:26.180 --> 40:27.500
that we have to deal with.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.140
Oh, it seems to have gone dormant.

40:29.140 --> 40:31.100
Like that's why I keep,

40:31.100 --> 40:32.700
that's why I really want people to understand,

40:32.700 --> 40:37.420
like it starts with hero worship in politics.

40:37.420 --> 40:40.220
It starts with this idea that we're waiting for somebody

40:40.220 --> 40:42.700
to lead us or say the right things

40:42.700 --> 40:46.100
or the president's office is so important and valuable

40:46.100 --> 40:47.260
and it changes so much

40:47.260 --> 40:48.820
and that's why we need the right person at office.

40:48.820 --> 40:53.820
And that really noble thought ends somewhere

40:54.540 --> 40:57.260
with like somehow you're making a pact with the devil

40:57.260 --> 40:59.300
where you're like, well, I'm not worth anything

40:59.300 --> 41:00.940
and I can't do anything and all this stuff.

41:00.940 --> 41:02.940
And then we're in this really dangerous time

41:02.940 --> 41:04.420
where we finally, for the first time,

41:04.420 --> 41:05.420
we've gotten this voice,

41:05.420 --> 41:07.460
like this first generation to be raised

41:07.460 --> 41:10.180
in front of a keyboard with a blinking cursor in front of it.

41:10.180 --> 41:11.660
They've mastered the hashtag

41:11.660 --> 41:14.580
and the linguistic acrobatics that represent

41:14.580 --> 41:17.060
like not getting all fucking bent out of shape

41:17.060 --> 41:18.860
when a girl says she just wants to be friends.

41:18.860 --> 41:22.580
Like they're advancing the species like by leaps and bounds

41:22.580 --> 41:26.460
because they're able to interface with machines

41:26.460 --> 41:30.380
and psychologically keep a lid on shit.

41:30.380 --> 41:32.820
However, like the scary thing about that

41:32.820 --> 41:34.580
is that now we're all just like,

41:34.580 --> 41:37.060
we're like talking and we're talking and we're talking

41:37.060 --> 41:38.940
about what's right and what's wrong.

41:38.940 --> 41:42.620
And I hope we don't tailspin until like,

41:42.620 --> 41:44.740
oh man, did you see that racist TV show last night?

41:44.740 --> 41:45.700
Yeah, that was so racist.

41:45.700 --> 41:46.540
Did you hashtag it?

41:46.540 --> 41:47.660
Yeah, I did.

41:47.660 --> 41:49.620
Well, this shit continues to happen,

41:49.620 --> 41:52.060
but it's like push may come to shove at a certain point.

41:52.060 --> 41:53.740
And it may not be the people that are saying

41:53.740 --> 41:57.060
the most eloquent, most progressive sounding things,

41:57.060 --> 41:59.780
that are the people who, at the bottom line of it all,

41:59.780 --> 42:01.860
are just people who want the power

42:01.860 --> 42:02.940
to leave the hands of the few

42:02.940 --> 42:04.460
and go into the hands of the many,

42:04.460 --> 42:08.980
who you may have to fight fucking fascism with anarchy.

42:08.980 --> 42:10.420
I don't know what else you fight it with.

42:10.420 --> 42:12.420
I put water on a fire myself.

42:12.420 --> 42:16.380
Like, and the fact that anarchy to us means explosions

42:16.380 --> 42:19.340
and chaos is part of a 70 year indoctrination

42:19.340 --> 42:20.380
that started with like,

42:20.380 --> 42:22.620
let's make that word mean terrorism, it doesn't.

42:22.620 --> 42:23.700
It means no hierarchy.

42:23.700 --> 42:25.900
It means nobody has a right to tell you what to do.

42:25.900 --> 42:29.540
So like, you know, we may have to,

42:30.900 --> 42:32.900
it's always scary the spattering of applause

42:32.900 --> 42:34.300
because it means that like,

42:34.300 --> 42:36.500
what I hear is the silence between each.

42:36.500 --> 42:40.460
I was like, oh, Harmon like said something

42:40.460 --> 42:42.100
really specific last night.

42:42.100 --> 42:45.660
I got that weird Chinese checkers applause.

42:45.660 --> 42:48.140
I was like, guys with bowler hats going,

42:48.140 --> 42:51.540
heard you loud and clear, blokey matey,

42:51.540 --> 42:53.460
milky milky welly well.

42:55.820 --> 42:58.020
Like our low level anarchism,

42:58.020 --> 42:59.900
the idea that we hate being told what to do,

42:59.900 --> 43:03.140
that the absence of rule doesn't mean chaos.

43:03.140 --> 43:03.980
It shouldn't mean that.

43:03.980 --> 43:05.860
No, anarchy doesn't mean,

43:05.860 --> 43:07.860
no, it does not mean like stirring shit up.

43:07.860 --> 43:09.980
It doesn't have to.

43:09.980 --> 43:12.620
Anarchy means you don't think you have a right

43:12.620 --> 43:13.620
to tell other people what to do.

43:13.620 --> 43:15.700
You don't really respect the right to tell you what to do.

43:15.700 --> 43:16.980
You don't really see that as a,

43:16.980 --> 43:19.300
you may see that as a way to put out a fire

43:19.300 --> 43:21.380
or get health insurance or get shit done.

43:21.380 --> 43:23.580
You know, like keep people from getting hurt

43:23.580 --> 43:25.380
in a crowd situation.

43:25.380 --> 43:27.540
But it's not an inherent need.

43:27.540 --> 43:30.020
You don't believe that people are these animals

43:30.020 --> 43:31.260
that left to their own devices

43:31.260 --> 43:32.740
are gonna like start running around

43:32.740 --> 43:35.100
and doing fucked up shit unless there's an elite class

43:35.100 --> 43:37.020
that pays themselves to do nothing

43:37.020 --> 43:40.260
but think about how we should be mitigated.

43:40.260 --> 43:43.180
It's, you just think that shit works the way it works.

43:43.180 --> 43:45.460
And the idea that right now, like,

43:45.460 --> 43:47.940
whether you like Hillary or you hate Trump

43:47.940 --> 43:50.460
or like Trump or hate, whatever the fuck you think,

43:50.460 --> 43:51.380
or if you're a Bernie supporter

43:51.380 --> 43:52.820
and you're all disappointed about that,

43:52.820 --> 43:55.340
the idea that one human being is going to come along

43:55.340 --> 43:58.020
and make everything okay is crazy.

43:58.020 --> 44:01.020
It's really adolescent and really dumb.

44:01.020 --> 44:02.860
The idea that we need leadership

44:02.860 --> 44:04.860
from one person holding one office

44:04.860 --> 44:06.780
that used to be a shit fucking gig,

44:06.780 --> 44:10.060
a low paid crap clerical gig

44:10.060 --> 44:12.780
in our constitutional government.

44:12.780 --> 44:14.180
It's really crazy, but right now,

44:14.180 --> 44:16.940
wouldn't we be really happy if anybody came along

44:16.940 --> 44:19.420
that could put a thoughtful sentence together

44:19.420 --> 44:22.260
and not irritate us?

44:22.260 --> 44:24.260
That's the danger of what's going on right now

44:24.260 --> 44:26.860
with this, it's gonna be Hillary and Trump.

44:26.860 --> 44:27.780
And we're gonna just go like,

44:27.780 --> 44:29.260
oh, I just wish somebody could talk

44:29.260 --> 44:32.940
and I would like to hear them finish the goddamn thought.

44:32.940 --> 44:34.460
And that's horrifying.

44:34.460 --> 44:37.500
We shouldn't care about one person's fucking ideas.

44:37.500 --> 44:42.300
There should be a gigantic consortium of people

44:42.300 --> 44:43.140
getting together.

44:43.140 --> 44:45.420
Community should fucking operate together.

44:45.420 --> 44:46.740
Family should operate together.

44:46.740 --> 44:48.060
But we have the tools to do it right now

44:48.060 --> 44:50.380
and this is a generation that's actively,

44:50.380 --> 44:52.020
like they're figuring out how to do that stuff.

44:52.020 --> 44:54.260
And I think that the next step,

44:54.260 --> 44:56.620
maybe it's not even thinking of waiting

44:56.620 --> 44:59.460
for some profit to arise and like switch things.

44:59.460 --> 45:00.780
It's like, it actually is just like,

45:00.780 --> 45:02.380
oh shit, we got these apps.

45:02.380 --> 45:04.180
We got this internet, we got it going.

45:04.180 --> 45:06.340
We can think and act locally

45:06.340 --> 45:08.700
and we can give unto Caesar what is Caesar's.

45:08.700 --> 45:10.740
Like because like, like just,

45:10.740 --> 45:12.700
instead of just letting the,

45:12.700 --> 45:13.540
we just came off this thing.

45:13.540 --> 45:14.460
I think all we're doing right now

45:14.460 --> 45:16.220
is voting for the next best Caesar.

45:16.220 --> 45:17.660
Like everybody is like.

45:17.660 --> 45:19.460
I know, but we don't, we could,

45:19.460 --> 45:20.700
there are some people in this audience

45:20.700 --> 45:22.260
that watch The Voice and American Idol,

45:22.260 --> 45:24.100
but they also watched Community.

45:24.100 --> 45:25.380
You know, like they can.

45:25.380 --> 45:29.340
That's not true.

45:31.020 --> 45:32.340
It means that you can say,

45:32.340 --> 45:34.140
like when I'm interested in who's gonna

45:34.140 --> 45:36.540
be the best singer in this season

45:36.540 --> 45:37.900
of the best singer show,

45:37.900 --> 45:40.460
I don't necessarily have to let that thought process

45:40.460 --> 45:42.300
trickle down into how I pass the salt

45:42.300 --> 45:43.780
to my friend over dinner.

45:43.780 --> 45:45.260
I don't have to, when they go,

45:45.260 --> 45:46.100
could you pass me the salt?

45:46.100 --> 45:46.940
I go, I don't know.

45:46.940 --> 45:49.860
How good are you at asking for passing the salt?

45:49.860 --> 45:51.540
Let's, you know, those glasses

45:51.540 --> 45:52.500
like don't look good on you.

45:52.500 --> 45:54.060
I think that smart look is stupid.

45:54.060 --> 45:56.420
Why don't you take them off and ask for the salt?

45:56.420 --> 45:58.220
All right, now, now give me a high C.

45:58.220 --> 45:59.660
I'd like the salt there.

45:59.660 --> 46:01.740
Now that's what I'm talking about.

46:01.740 --> 46:02.900
Now you've earned my salt

46:02.900 --> 46:04.460
because I watch American Idol.

46:04.460 --> 46:05.940
Like, no, you can watch American Idol

46:05.940 --> 46:07.620
and you can go, that's for that.

46:07.620 --> 46:09.060
You can elect a president and go,

46:09.060 --> 46:11.700
that's a person that if a Supreme Court justice dies,

46:11.700 --> 46:14.020
they have the power to like, no, you know,

46:14.020 --> 46:16.660
like there are certain things that like are important

46:16.660 --> 46:18.340
that we're voting for these people for,

46:18.340 --> 46:20.060
but it doesn't have to anything to do with like,

46:20.060 --> 46:21.540
whether your street has potholes on it

46:21.540 --> 46:23.060
and all that shit.

46:23.060 --> 46:24.460
Me, I'm old and I'm busy.

46:24.460 --> 46:25.380
So good luck.

46:25.380 --> 46:29.140
But, but I do think, I mean, yeah, I mean,

46:29.140 --> 46:31.540
it's like, like what if we did enter an age

46:31.540 --> 46:33.740
when we were just voting for the least offensive person?

46:33.740 --> 46:35.020
What if that was their job?

46:35.020 --> 46:36.740
You know, and they didn't, you know,

46:36.740 --> 46:39.660
and then like, what if you built like from the ground up?

46:39.660 --> 46:41.380
Like you built like the sort of like,

46:41.380 --> 46:43.500
there was a word for it and there was a phrase for it.

46:43.500 --> 46:45.820
And it was anarchy because it didn't have leadership

46:45.820 --> 46:46.660
because it didn't need it

46:46.660 --> 46:48.380
because it did take advantage of technology

46:48.380 --> 46:50.540
faster than these people at the top could.

46:50.540 --> 46:53.020
And so that they found themselves

46:53.020 --> 46:55.260
in the most powerful position of the world,

46:55.260 --> 46:58.140
but it was in charge of a fucking slab of marble

46:58.140 --> 47:00.060
that couldn't be cracked, couldn't be lifted

47:00.060 --> 47:00.980
and couldn't be moved.

47:00.980 --> 47:02.540
And they're like, I'm on top of it,

47:02.540 --> 47:03.940
kind of lonely up here.

47:03.940 --> 47:06.420
And Wendy, I get to jump off in four years

47:06.420 --> 47:08.260
or stay on for another four.

47:08.260 --> 47:10.860
And the people that don't fuck up get to stay up there.

47:10.860 --> 47:13.300
And we're down here going like, we figured it out.

47:13.300 --> 47:17.300
We are, it has to do with on a molecular level going like,

47:17.300 --> 47:19.300
I think our biggest challenge right now is

47:19.300 --> 47:22.020
we've been so stoked about how much cleaning needs

47:22.020 --> 47:23.540
to be done around the apartment

47:23.540 --> 47:25.460
that you ever get on one of those tantrums

47:25.460 --> 47:28.220
where you're like, you're like, fuck off this shit,

47:28.220 --> 47:31.100
fuck it, shit, you're just throwing away like,

47:31.100 --> 47:35.380
Bibles and like, new pens and money.

47:35.380 --> 47:37.740
Like I'm gonna take like fistful of pennies

47:37.740 --> 47:38.900
and you're like, fucking pennies,

47:38.900 --> 47:40.460
you're going to have fucking pennies.

47:40.460 --> 47:43.020
Like when you're like cleaning your office or whatever

47:43.020 --> 47:44.340
and you're like, fucking like,

47:44.340 --> 47:46.500
it just brings like this rage out in you

47:46.500 --> 47:47.940
that is like against clutter.

47:47.940 --> 47:50.260
And you're like, I want to simplify my life.

47:50.260 --> 47:52.500
I think that's, we've hit the peak of that

47:52.500 --> 47:54.100
with the whole woke kind of thing.

47:54.100 --> 47:55.740
Like where we're calling out racism,

47:55.740 --> 47:57.020
we're calling out negative thought,

47:57.020 --> 47:59.300
we're exposing like, we're like,

47:59.300 --> 48:00.940
what the fuck has this person ever done for me?

48:00.940 --> 48:02.780
Ah, another person that turns out to hate women.

48:02.780 --> 48:03.860
No big surprise.

48:03.860 --> 48:05.580
And it's like, and everything has to go

48:05.580 --> 48:06.540
in the garbage right now

48:06.540 --> 48:08.740
because we're like cleaning out our space.

48:08.740 --> 48:11.980
But like, we are gonna have to get to a point

48:11.980 --> 48:14.220
where if that space is gonna be of any use,

48:14.220 --> 48:15.420
we're gonna have to be like,

48:15.420 --> 48:17.100
well, not everything that goes in this room

48:17.100 --> 48:20.060
needs to be the Mona Lisa because this isn't a museum.

48:20.060 --> 48:22.660
This is an office or a living room or a parlor.

48:22.660 --> 48:26.700
You know, like my friend has some regressive thoughts

48:26.700 --> 48:28.220
about women.

48:28.220 --> 48:31.540
He hasn't scratched that off on his bingo card yet.

48:31.540 --> 48:35.340
He's really, really like super amazing about race.

48:35.340 --> 48:38.260
He really hates women.

48:38.260 --> 48:39.740
Like I'm not gonna like,

48:39.740 --> 48:43.220
like just record him over lunch

48:43.220 --> 48:47.340
and then post it on Facebook and expose him as a thing.

48:47.340 --> 48:48.740
Like I'm going to,

48:48.740 --> 48:51.340
I'm gonna like actually like work with him

48:51.340 --> 48:56.180
and like, you know, like kind of polish him

48:56.180 --> 48:58.980
like a stone, like like with my water, you know?

49:00.380 --> 49:04.420
I'm gonna, and strangers that I find out are regressive.

49:04.420 --> 49:07.140
I'm ignorant because they haven't talked to

49:07.140 --> 49:09.340
as many people that look like me yet.

49:09.340 --> 49:13.100
I'm going to, I'm gonna do something really difficult

49:13.100 --> 49:16.740
which is like, I'm just gonna like have to be this billboard

49:16.740 --> 49:19.660
for people that this person has never talked to

49:19.660 --> 49:21.700
and I'm gonna make every experience a positive one

49:21.700 --> 49:24.740
or like, I don't know what the fucking definition is,

49:24.740 --> 49:26.340
but it's like harder than,

49:26.340 --> 49:29.620
it's way, way harder than finger pointing and shaming

49:29.620 --> 49:33.700
and like, enchanting and like pushing down another pillar

49:33.700 --> 49:36.100
and watching another thing that was resting on it collapse.

49:36.100 --> 49:38.900
Like I think that we've got a good six months left of that

49:38.900 --> 49:40.220
before it gets like,

49:40.220 --> 49:43.340
aren't we just, when the guy running with like,

49:43.340 --> 49:46.540
one of the two people running is just like this turd person.

49:46.540 --> 49:49.740
Like he's just, he's not gonna do anything with that rubble.

49:49.740 --> 49:51.940
Like he's not gonna let go, thank you very much.

49:51.940 --> 49:52.940
And now I'm gonna take that

49:52.940 --> 49:54.940
and we're gonna build a big monument to women with it.

49:54.940 --> 49:57.260
Like he's not going, he's gonna go like,

49:57.260 --> 49:59.260
let's make missiles with this rubble.

50:00.740 --> 50:03.820
It's gonna be up to us,

50:03.820 --> 50:07.100
like how we interior decorate the nation.

50:07.100 --> 50:12.100
It, yeah, we should do it, we'll do it on the moon.

50:14.020 --> 50:17.260
I, I, I was, I was just gonna say that.

50:17.260 --> 50:18.900
Like after his cars kill,

50:20.100 --> 50:21.460
maybe we can like merge with him

50:21.460 --> 50:23.500
and he'll like, if you give us a,

50:23.500 --> 50:26.100
right before you said to still on the moon,

50:26.100 --> 50:29.540
the original like joke premise of, of this podcast was like,

50:29.540 --> 50:31.380
like we'd like, let's find like-minded people

50:31.380 --> 50:34.340
and colonize another place and make things okay.

50:34.340 --> 50:35.820
Like we're gonna have to like,

50:35.820 --> 50:40.020
start like making colonies of like-minded people here

50:40.020 --> 50:42.420
and actually let that become revolutionary.

50:42.420 --> 50:44.380
You know where we're gonna start doing it, Jeff,

50:44.380 --> 50:47.220
where we pick the people that, that get to help us

50:47.220 --> 50:49.460
at the Comic-Con Harmontown show.

50:49.460 --> 50:54.460
Oh shit. Wait, are you talking about the one July 22nd?

50:57.540 --> 50:59.380
At the, what theater?

50:59.380 --> 51:00.700
At the Balboa Theater?

51:00.700 --> 51:02.060
At the Balboa Theater?

51:02.060 --> 51:04.580
The one who apparently our ticket sales are so shit

51:04.580 --> 51:07.740
that we have to shoehorn this into our own show?

51:07.740 --> 51:11.260
Apparently the show that's got show runners so worried

51:11.260 --> 51:13.340
that they're calling Steve Levy and saying,

51:13.340 --> 51:14.740
you guys gotta sell tickets

51:14.740 --> 51:17.220
or we're gonna have to nix this whole thing.

51:17.220 --> 51:18.060
Not me show, right?

51:18.060 --> 51:21.300
Not show run, like the ones that run the shows having.

51:21.300 --> 51:22.140
What do they call them?

51:22.140 --> 51:23.940
Stage Peoples, right?

51:23.940 --> 51:24.780
Stage Peoples.

51:24.780 --> 51:25.620
Stage Peoples.

51:25.620 --> 51:26.460
Stage Peoples.

51:26.460 --> 51:28.580
Oh yeah, big time.

51:28.580 --> 51:29.820
You know what else happens?

51:29.820 --> 51:31.820
How many seats is the Balboa Theater, Steve Levy?

51:31.820 --> 51:32.820
So many.

51:34.820 --> 51:35.660
A thousand?

51:35.660 --> 51:37.580
Oh, we can do a thousand on our fucking heads.

51:37.580 --> 51:39.260
I mean, we don't even have to,

51:39.260 --> 51:42.460
but we aren't even doing not even a thousand.

51:42.460 --> 51:45.260
How much, what's the ticket price at the Balboa Theater?

51:45.260 --> 51:46.420
$24.

51:46.420 --> 51:47.780
$24?

51:47.780 --> 51:48.620
Okay, fuck it.

51:48.620 --> 51:49.460
Don't go.

51:49.460 --> 51:52.260
That's, that's too much.

51:52.260 --> 51:53.100
That's a lot of money.

51:53.100 --> 51:54.940
That's their problem.

51:54.940 --> 51:57.780
It should be fucking, I would say 12 tops.

51:57.780 --> 52:01.260
I would say your $10 here is a little unfair.

52:01.260 --> 52:03.660
And I think you're getting ripped off a little bit

52:04.740 --> 52:07.260
to the tune of two to four dollars.

52:08.700 --> 52:10.780
I would call this a eight to six dollars.

52:10.780 --> 52:12.900
Also, at Comic-Con here,

52:12.900 --> 52:14.460
Steve's shaking his head.

52:14.460 --> 52:18.620
$24, also, you have to be in San Diego,

52:18.620 --> 52:21.100
which is, you should have to get $24 back

52:21.100 --> 52:22.700
just for entering San Diego.

52:22.700 --> 52:26.060
That, well, that is true.

52:26.060 --> 52:26.900
It sucks.

52:26.900 --> 52:28.220
It's a terrible, terrible city.

52:28.220 --> 52:30.140
We're smart people, we can figure this out.

52:30.140 --> 52:31.700
Have you tried Mexican food in San Diego?

52:31.700 --> 52:32.620
You think it would be great.

52:32.620 --> 52:34.380
It's right by it.

52:34.380 --> 52:36.380
It's right by Mexico.

52:36.380 --> 52:38.860
And you'd be fucked if you can get a fucking proper taco

52:38.860 --> 52:40.060
without leaving the tent.

52:40.060 --> 52:42.660
You have to get out of San Diego to get Mexican food.

52:42.660 --> 52:44.020
You'd be fucked.

52:44.020 --> 52:45.060
Huh?

52:45.060 --> 52:46.260
If you'd try to get a taco.

52:46.260 --> 52:47.100
Yeah.

52:47.100 --> 52:48.100
You're going to the wrong places.

52:48.100 --> 52:49.020
You're going to the wrong places.

52:49.020 --> 52:50.660
There's one guy.

52:50.660 --> 52:54.820
Look, yes, I know the San Diego people here.

52:54.820 --> 52:55.900
Well, me after the show,

52:55.900 --> 52:57.660
you tell me where to go get tacos,

52:57.660 --> 53:00.460
and I will tell you that it's not in San Diego.

53:00.460 --> 53:02.260
You're just outside of town.

53:03.180 --> 53:05.300
You have to get out, you have to go so,

53:05.300 --> 53:06.780
it's not a walk from Comic-Con.

53:06.780 --> 53:09.500
You have to get into a car to get fucking food there.

53:09.500 --> 53:11.380
Let's find out, let's ask ourselves.

53:11.380 --> 53:13.420
I'm saying don't go to Comic-Con.

53:13.420 --> 53:16.220
Don't go to the Balboa Theater on July 22nd.

53:17.340 --> 53:19.500
I don't think you have the guts to prove me wrong.

53:19.500 --> 53:20.340
Let's...

53:22.820 --> 53:23.660
I guess there's that.

53:23.660 --> 53:25.300
I've been to your shittiest town.

53:26.420 --> 53:29.700
I would say let's figure out if this is a $10 show.

53:29.700 --> 53:31.220
Just every guy has a wallet chain on.

53:31.220 --> 53:34.860
Well, we'll give out free prizes at the Comic-Con.

53:34.860 --> 53:37.420
If you're walking into an establishment

53:37.420 --> 53:38.820
and the bouncer has a wallet chain on,

53:38.820 --> 53:40.620
you're in a terrible place.

53:40.620 --> 53:43.340
Let's figure out if this is...

53:43.340 --> 53:44.940
Barbed wire tattoos?

53:44.940 --> 53:46.340
Nope, nope, nope.

53:46.340 --> 53:48.460
If this is a $10 show.

53:48.460 --> 53:49.620
No, no.

53:49.620 --> 53:52.780
Then we just need to figure out what a $12 show is,

53:52.780 --> 53:55.540
which is as easy as raising this one 20%

53:55.540 --> 53:56.580
in terms of quality,

53:56.580 --> 53:58.500
and then doubling that for San Diego.

53:58.500 --> 53:59.820
Right.

53:59.820 --> 54:02.340
That's all I wanted to say for the last five hours.

54:02.340 --> 54:03.180
What's that?

54:03.180 --> 54:04.020
We go for five hours.

54:04.020 --> 54:06.020
I don't think that increases the value of our show.

54:06.020 --> 54:09.420
I will have no respect for anybody

54:09.420 --> 54:12.180
that pays to see our show in San Diego.

54:12.180 --> 54:13.980
I will be mad at everybody that comes there

54:13.980 --> 54:18.580
and has put down $24 in the Balboa Theater on July 22nd.

54:20.900 --> 54:22.900
And not just because Dan and I are gonna do

54:22.900 --> 54:27.100
an all-nude review to start the show.

54:27.100 --> 54:29.020
I'm saying it's not a reason to go see it.

54:29.020 --> 54:30.820
And we'd also be really mad

54:30.820 --> 54:33.740
if you made a website using Squarespace.

54:36.220 --> 54:39.260
Even though they use an intuitive design

54:39.260 --> 54:41.140
that works across all platforms.

54:41.140 --> 54:45.380
Also, maybe you live in LA, all you people here.

54:45.380 --> 54:47.500
Maybe driving down to San Diego,

54:47.500 --> 54:49.340
don't listen to Audible.com.

54:51.100 --> 54:53.420
I don't care how reasonable the prices are

54:53.420 --> 54:55.580
to listen to your favorite novels online,

54:55.580 --> 54:57.940
or even if you get a free book with sign-up.

55:00.780 --> 55:02.540
And I don't care if you're wearing my undies,

55:02.540 --> 55:03.940
the softest underwear.

55:05.140 --> 55:06.460
Well, who needs books anyway?

55:06.460 --> 55:09.220
When, you know, it's like all you people out there

55:09.220 --> 55:11.780
with your stupid Warby Parker glasses.

55:16.180 --> 55:17.940
Which we also don't want you to get.

55:17.940 --> 55:20.180
And when you get them,

55:20.180 --> 55:24.460
don't use them to look at fullscreen.com's content.

55:24.460 --> 55:28.060
Even though it only costs as much as a cup of coffee.

55:28.060 --> 55:29.380
A cup of coffee.

55:29.380 --> 55:30.740
A giant coffee a month.

55:30.740 --> 55:35.740
Yeah, for a month.

55:36.660 --> 55:38.340
But I think the reverse thing has to work,

55:38.340 --> 55:39.740
but I think you have to say to them,

55:39.740 --> 55:44.260
like, don't come, or if you do, I'll kiss you to death.

55:44.260 --> 55:45.820
Will it be on CISO?

55:45.820 --> 55:47.260
No, no.

55:47.260 --> 55:48.660
The comic-con show, no.

55:48.660 --> 55:49.740
No, no.

55:49.740 --> 55:50.580
No, it won't.

55:50.580 --> 55:51.420
You won't be able to see it.

55:51.420 --> 55:52.700
You won't, we should do.

55:52.700 --> 55:54.220
We should not record it.

55:55.180 --> 55:56.540
No, shit.

55:56.540 --> 55:57.380
Oh!

55:57.380 --> 55:58.220
Oh!

56:00.260 --> 56:02.580
Master Blaster, Rottenbarter Town!

56:04.180 --> 56:05.540
No more pig shit!

56:05.540 --> 56:06.380
Phew!

56:07.620 --> 56:09.140
Are you threatening or writing a song?

56:09.140 --> 56:10.100
That's right.

56:10.100 --> 56:13.700
Drive to San Diego and give us $24.

56:16.020 --> 56:18.900
I want everyone to prove me,

56:18.900 --> 56:21.740
someone take me to get to the best taco place in San Diego

56:21.740 --> 56:24.020
so I could not be mad at San Diego.

56:24.020 --> 56:24.860
Taco's El Gordo.

56:24.860 --> 56:26.220
Taco's El Gordo, what?

56:26.220 --> 56:27.460
El Gordo.

56:27.460 --> 56:28.300
Eduardo.

56:28.300 --> 56:29.420
El Gordo.

56:29.420 --> 56:31.860
El Gordo, El Gordo.

56:31.860 --> 56:33.820
I'll tell you after the show.

56:33.820 --> 56:34.700
El Gordo.

56:34.700 --> 56:36.260
El Gordo.

56:36.260 --> 56:37.940
Gordo, fat, fat.

56:37.940 --> 56:39.540
Gordo, Gordo.

56:39.540 --> 56:40.380
El Gordo.

56:40.380 --> 56:41.220
Yeah.

56:41.220 --> 56:42.060
Fatty tacos.

56:42.060 --> 56:42.900
Something like that.

56:42.900 --> 56:46.460
Who's like a, who's a huge...

56:46.460 --> 56:47.300
Oh, me.

56:50.340 --> 56:55.020
Who's a huge Harmontown fan and like maybe,

56:55.020 --> 56:57.580
I don't know, I was gonna say has like a degree in marketing

56:57.580 --> 57:00.940
but maybe in your own head you do.

57:00.940 --> 57:03.900
Like you think you know, like you're sitting here,

57:03.900 --> 57:05.540
a young lady raised her hand there,

57:05.540 --> 57:08.140
like would you like to come up and just...

57:08.140 --> 57:09.460
No, you don't wanna, yeah?

57:09.460 --> 57:10.780
Okay.

57:10.780 --> 57:15.140
Wait, we've got, we'll keep him in my,

57:15.140 --> 57:16.340
we'll put him on deck.

57:18.500 --> 57:19.900
She's charging the stage, I love it.

57:19.900 --> 57:20.740
Yeah.

57:20.740 --> 57:21.580
What's your name?

57:21.580 --> 57:22.420
Savannah.

57:22.420 --> 57:23.260
Savannah.

57:23.260 --> 57:25.180
Savannah, have a seat, grab a mic.

57:25.180 --> 57:27.980
I think they're, oh, here.

57:29.100 --> 57:29.940
Here, you use this.

57:29.940 --> 57:30.780
Get her a mic.

57:30.780 --> 57:31.620
Oh, okay.

57:33.060 --> 57:34.700
All right, okay.

57:34.700 --> 57:37.020
I switched mics for those of you in the control booth.

57:37.020 --> 57:38.020
If you like spending, you can pull off the stands.

57:38.020 --> 57:40.020
Oh, no, you can, yeah, sit and, yeah, here,

57:40.020 --> 57:43.020
let's get rid of this piece of shit, a piece of shit.

57:45.020 --> 57:46.260
Why is it there?

57:46.260 --> 57:47.460
It's made of pennies.

57:48.780 --> 57:50.020
Did you ever throw away pennies

57:50.020 --> 57:51.860
when you're cleaning your office or your room or something?

57:51.860 --> 57:54.220
I wouldn't be bothered to organize things.

57:54.220 --> 57:55.300
I just throw it all in a bag.

57:55.300 --> 57:57.220
You ever throw away books?

57:57.220 --> 57:59.220
Yeah, a couple of times.

57:59.220 --> 58:00.060
You feel guilty, right?

58:00.060 --> 58:01.900
Like as you're like, it's like knowledge and it's like.

58:01.900 --> 58:04.820
Yeah, especially if I like paid for them for school,

58:04.820 --> 58:06.580
I just like, but there's so much anger.

58:06.580 --> 58:08.940
What is that guilt we feel about throwing away books?

58:08.940 --> 58:11.140
I don't throw away books.

58:11.140 --> 58:16.060
Well, because I would feel too guilty about it.

58:16.060 --> 58:17.580
Okay, well, what is that guilt?

58:17.580 --> 58:18.780
What is it?

58:18.780 --> 58:21.140
Somebody put a lot of effort into a book, I think.

58:21.140 --> 58:23.220
I couldn't, even if I hate the book.

58:23.220 --> 58:25.780
We don't treat it as the physical thing that it is.

58:25.780 --> 58:28.540
We treat it as the ideas it represents.

58:28.540 --> 58:30.260
Like when you work in books,

58:30.260 --> 58:31.820
you're like this fucking garbage

58:31.820 --> 58:33.260
and you're ripping covers off shit.

58:33.260 --> 58:35.660
It's like a really weird harrowing experience.

58:35.660 --> 58:38.540
I'd assume it's a lot like working in the meat industry.

58:38.540 --> 58:39.900
You know?

58:39.900 --> 58:42.260
We're soon out of here just banging calves

58:42.260 --> 58:44.260
against walls and shit.

58:44.260 --> 58:45.980
Yeah, look it up.

58:45.980 --> 58:47.620
It could even be a subjective guilt

58:47.620 --> 58:50.340
that's like the equivalent of throwing away a barbell.

58:50.340 --> 58:52.020
Or you're like, that you've never used.

58:52.020 --> 58:54.460
Like you're like, oh, am I really committing to throwing away

58:54.460 --> 58:55.660
the barbell?

58:55.660 --> 58:59.180
And also the garbage man's going to be like, Jesus Christ.

58:59.180 --> 59:01.180
He's all ripped.

59:01.180 --> 59:02.260
Stand 11.

59:02.260 --> 59:03.260
Stand 11.

59:03.260 --> 59:04.260
Woo!

59:04.260 --> 59:05.260
Woo!

59:05.260 --> 59:06.260
Woo!

59:06.260 --> 59:07.260
Woo!

59:07.260 --> 59:08.260
Woo!

59:08.260 --> 59:09.260
Woo!

59:09.260 --> 59:10.260
Woo!

59:10.260 --> 59:11.260
Uh, Savannah?

59:11.260 --> 59:12.260
Yeah, Savannah.

59:12.260 --> 59:13.260
Like the biome?

59:13.260 --> 59:17.020
Yes, exactly like the biome, but with only one N.

59:17.020 --> 59:18.860
So the biome, but with one N.

59:18.860 --> 59:19.860
Savannah.

59:19.860 --> 59:20.860
Yeah.

59:20.860 --> 59:26.580
Where apes supposedly started walking upright to see over the tall grass and then to free

59:26.580 --> 59:28.260
their hands for tool use.

59:28.260 --> 59:30.660
But not true, the Savannah theory.

59:30.660 --> 59:36.620
Wiped off the charts in 1995 by virtue of finding a new semi-human that had nutrients

59:36.620 --> 59:41.300
in its bones that could not have been the result of eating food on the Savannah.

59:41.300 --> 59:43.660
So we're living in a world where we don't know where humans came from.

59:43.660 --> 59:44.660
Aquatic ape.

59:44.660 --> 59:45.660
All right.

59:45.660 --> 59:52.260
But I'm sure it's a beautiful name.

59:52.260 --> 59:53.260
So what do you think?

59:53.260 --> 59:57.860
You're a big Harmontown fan and you're thinking like, when you apply your mind to how we

59:57.860 --> 01:00:02.980
could get people to show up to the Balboa Theater on Friday, oh you didn't know I was

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.980
going to twist it to that?

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:04.980
No, I didn't.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:05.980
Oh, okay.

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:06.980
Well, what did you think I was going to ask?

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:07.980
I don't know.

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.980
I thought maybe you had a theory or something.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:09.980
I didn't know.

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:14.460
Well, what's your favorite aspect of Harmontown?

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:17.380
The prizes.

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.380
The cash giveaways.

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.700
The prizes and free alcohol.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:21.700
Yeah.

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:22.700
Uh-oh.

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:23.700
What do you want to drink?

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.700
Is that what you're saying?

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:25.700
No, absolutely.

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.700
I'm okay.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:27.700
I'm drinking.

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:28.700
No, but you know.

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.700
Have a drink, Savannah.

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:33.740
What's a thing, put it this way.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:41.140
So say I'm like a businessman that bought Harmontown and I'm like, I want to make Harmontown,

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:46.980
I'm going to give it to people, I'm going to do something like, I won't get specific,

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.900
but like you've been called in as like a Harmontown expert.

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:54.460
Like all the other Harmontown listeners have been wiped out in some like pretzel factory

01:00:54.460 --> 01:01:01.940
explosion or like during like dollar tours because they're frugal, they're practical,

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:03.700
they love sodium.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:10.020
My demographic is stuff like polls don't lie.

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:12.020
You guys love pretzels.

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:16.940
So they're all wiped out and you're sort of like the person who's in charge of like representing

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.340
the demographic that is like, that listens to the show.

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:25.500
And so some like suit is like hauling you in and going like, what's the deal with it?

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:29.580
Why don't I just get rid of it and what parts of it do I preserve?

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:30.580
What's the point?

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:34.100
And like what kind of things would you?

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:40.980
Well, I'm sorry to all the other Harmontown fans who are gone, but I think they would

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:45.980
probably if they were still there, would like maybe some of Jane's alcohol merchandise

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:46.980
for Harmontown.

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.620
I'll bring some.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:50.980
I have some at my house.

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:55.820
We could bring it to give away to the fans bottles like the problem is that that's highly

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:59.380
illegal for like various federal reasons.

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:00.380
So figure that out.

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.380
Yes.

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.380
Yeah.

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.380
He's not allowed to license his own booze.

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.380
Okay.

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:10.860
Um, and maybe her, sorry, more free t-shirts, more free t-shirts, oh, I think we got a shit

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.860
ton of t-shirts.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:12.860
Yeah.

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:17.020
Um, an Instagram contest maybe if you want to get the young people, Instagram contest

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:18.540
snapchat, snapchat contest.

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:19.540
How does that work?

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.540
How does it?

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:24.020
Um, will you just give them a time limit to submit things on whatever platform you're

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.940
going to use for Snapchat if you create like a filter for your show?

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:31.260
It's five dollars for just the evening for just the area that you're doing it in.

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:32.260
What?

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:33.260
Yeah, five dollars.

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:34.260
Yeah.

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.260
Do that tonight.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:37.260
It's the big old dick.

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:43.260
Wait, I, I didn't, I don't, you're in large month, bitch.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.260
Yeah.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:49.260
Hashtag Spencer's dick.

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:52.900
Hashtag, no, just, just, just large month.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.420
I actually don't understand.

01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:56.740
Can you, cause I want to understand.

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:57.900
So do you use Snapchat?

01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:58.900
I have.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:02:59.900
Yes.

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:00.900
Okay.

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:03.180
So on Snapchat there are the filters you can use that companies can create.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.180
You can also create them for communities if you're not making any money off of it.

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:09.180
And those are free if you get them approved and they meet the community guidelines, which

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:11.180
I'm not sure if you're.

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:12.180
No, it will.

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.180
It's, it's great.

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.180
I know a guy at Snapchat.

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:19.980
You're saying we can do like an exclusive Harmontown Snapchat thing that puts a dick

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:21.380
on your head or whatever.

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.380
Exactly.

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.260
So you would create the filter.

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.260
It's really easy to do.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.860
Oh, and it only works in that geo-fenced area.

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:34.980
And for 20,000 square feet you can do for like $5 for the day, you can, you can do it.

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:35.980
And how does that also apply?

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:36.980
Sorry, I don't mean to cut you off.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:37.980
You're a fountain of information.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:44.740
I'm like putting my thumb over you, but, but, but I also, is there something similar

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:46.140
to do that with Instagram?

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.140
Like a.

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.140
For Instagram it would be different.

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:51.100
You wouldn't necessarily do a filter, though someone could take it with their Snapchat,

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:54.220
take it with a filter and then upload that to Instagram because now Instagram doesn't

01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.220
have a limit.

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:56.220
You don't just have to do square photos.

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.220
You can do that like.

01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:58.220
All right.

01:03:58.220 --> 01:03:59.220
Vertical ones.

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:00.220
And then they could throw that on there.

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:01.220
So you could do it either way.

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:02.220
I would say do it separately.

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.220
It's a little too much work.

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:04.220
You want something really quick.

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:08.540
So you would have them send it to you, like create like a Harmontown Snapchat account

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.860
and then everyone would take photos and then send it on their story, but also send it to

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:15.660
the Snapchat account for Harmontown and you pick the favorite one, you could broadcast

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:16.660
them on the screen.

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:17.900
You could do a lot of different things with it.

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:19.740
Maybe we could use one of those hashtags.

01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:21.740
You could use a hashtag.

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:22.740
All right.

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.900
So how can I pervert this into a way to, because I don't, the only thing I need help with

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:31.780
is getting people into the Balboa Theater on the 22nd.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.660
I'm saying don't come.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.780
That's all we'll put on the Snapchat filter.

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.580
Anyone in the area will know.

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:41.540
Well, you could do it.

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:45.140
So they would only be able to use the filter if they were in that area and then if you'd

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.420
have to take a photo with the filter or they'd have to like, you know, tag themselves there.

01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:51.660
They'd have to take a picture maybe with someone, you know, something that shows that they

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:54.460
were at the event or they just have to promote it themselves.

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:59.500
Oh, you're saying like, so people who, so people who, this is the age old thing of like,

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:04.180
anyone who comes to this thing is eligible maybe for a thing that's like, at the top

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:07.620
of that is like a big deal like, I'm going to, restaurants do that, like the habit when

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:11.620
they open something new, they'll like do that where you have to go and you take a photo

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:15.300
with their Snapchat filter and then they give you free swag with the habit on it, which

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.620
is not like, maybe some people are really into the habit.

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:22.540
So you want to have it, but for other people who want Harmontown swag, they could take

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:25.780
a photo and then if there's evidence they do that, then you could get something free

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:27.980
when they check and when they're ticket out there.

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:33.140
What if, what if you and a friend, but I want this to be contingent on all thousand seats

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:34.140
filled.

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:38.860
We could give them free habit.

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:45.460
The prize is whatever, whatever the contest is, the prize is that then you, you and a

01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:53.580
friend cause we want it to be just a technically an abduction, they, they come home with, with

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:59.620
me and my friends on the, on the party bus that I booked to go back and then they come

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:06.340
and they, they live in my house and, and they just come to work with me, but it's like the

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:11.740
fine print is like, you're getting up at like seven AM sometimes and like, like my dogs

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:16.300
are going to like, like, like, like, like Harvey will roll over and do a submissive

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.780
pee on you.

01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:20.300
Like I don't make breakfast.

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:22.580
Like I, you'll be drinking Soylent.

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:23.580
Yeah.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.100
You don't keep food in the house really.

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:28.860
But like you can stay in my, I have a guest room and then like, you could like, you could

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:33.220
just come, you just come like, like, like, if I could put you in a backpack, I would

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:38.420
like, but like, you just like, or handcuff you to me and like you would just, I was just

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:43.700
right Rick and Morty and you'd be there and like that would be thrilling for some people.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:44.700
Yeah.

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:45.700
I'm sure.

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:46.700
Yeah.

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:47.700
I'm sure.

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.700
Yeah.

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.700
Even the, even the chance at it might make a thousand people show up.

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:50.700
Yeah.

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:51.700
But maybe that's the contingency as I go.

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:52.700
A thousand people didn't show up.

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:55.220
So the top prize is a t-shirt.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.220
That sounds great.

01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.220
All right.

01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:02.340
We'll figure something like that out because that's what I, because I'm like, I don't,

01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:06.100
I don't do stuff when I go home at night, like sit on a bowl of ice cream or like, like

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:09.220
look at like, I don't have like a shoebox of Polaroids or anything.

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:13.740
So that's like a resource I have where I could just like, I could just like have a person.

01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:17.940
This isn't an invitation to stalk me, but I'm just saying like, my life is compatible

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:20.220
with like just a person like walking around.

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:21.700
That's what Spencer and Steve Levy are.

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:25.740
They, they, they, they, they, they, we all cohabitate.

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.740
Yeah.

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:28.060
Like we're just a family.

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:31.220
So maybe, maybe that's like a luxurious package.

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:32.980
I think that's what we did for the AIDS thing.

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:33.980
Oh yeah.

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:37.300
Yeah, that like, for Rick and Morty, like they're going to come home.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:38.300
Sorry.

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:39.300
Jeff did a thing.

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.300
It was great.

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:41.780
I, I, I don't know what you're talking about.

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:42.780
All right.

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:44.780
Rick and Morty did an AIDS thing.

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:45.780
Yeah.

01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:48.820
Where you could like, the more you donate it, you are eligible for a thing where you, you

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:52.100
do a voice on Rick and Morty and then I think you hang out, but not, yeah, like maybe

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:53.100
it'll be like.

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:54.100
We still got to do that, right?

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:55.100
Right?

01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:56.100
Yeah.

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.100
Yeah.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.100
Yeah.

01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:59.100
Yeah.

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.100
You can't, you can't.

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:04.740
But Dan, you were talking, you were talking about earlier about like hanging out in Comic

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:05.740
Con is kind of a bummer.

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.900
It's, it would be fun to have like a little party space.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.620
What if we had, what if we had like a little, like our own little party?

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.820
Oh, we'll be hanging out at the Geek and Sundry Lounge.

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.500
Is that right?

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:16.500
Yeah.

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.500
Just go there.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:18.500
It'll be fine.

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:22.500
What are they going to do?

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.500
All right.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.780
Savannah, you want to see what this other guy has to say maybe?

01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:28.780
Yeah, sure.

01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:30.340
You're not afraid of a little competition.

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:31.340
Why don't you come up, sir?

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:32.340
You know who you are.

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.340
Hello, sir.

01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:34.340
Are you Luke?

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:35.340
I'm Zach.

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:36.340
Zach.

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:37.340
Yeah.

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:38.340
Wait.

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:39.340
Did you bring me the booze?

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:40.340
No.

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:41.340
No, that was Luke.

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.340
He looks like me though.

01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:53.340
That was another, that was another guy that was bald with a beard.

01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:54.860
There are many of us here tonight.

01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:55.860
Oh yeah.

01:08:55.860 --> 01:09:01.100
I'm among my people and it's just, it's just, you know, it's to beat the heat.

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.940
You're not, you're not a neo-Nazi.

01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:05.020
I'm, no, I'm certainly not.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:08.620
He's got one of those Hillary stars on his shirt.

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:12.460
Sorry, I didn't hear that.

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:15.380
Oh, stars of David on your shirt.

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.700
They're Chicago stars.

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:17.700
Yeah.

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:22.380
You know, yeah, that, they actually do look more like, you know, so it's fine.

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:25.820
I don't like the placement though, because they're like, what are we doing?

01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:29.340
So I'm talking, we're getting to know Zach and we're welcoming him and not terrorizing

01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:30.340
him.

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.340
I want to, now that I know that.

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:33.340
All right.

01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:34.900
Well, I'll fill you in more carefully.

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:35.900
Jesus Christ.

01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:36.900
I know.

01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.900
So the tail wags the dog around him.

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:39.900
He's like this?

01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:43.260
He's, he's, he's in a, he's, he's in a good mood, I think.

01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:44.260
Yeah.

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:45.260
What's he really like?

01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:46.500
Are you guys comfortable?

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.500
We want you to feel that way.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:54.180
I'm, as long as I'm amongst you and Dan and Jeff, I'm comfortable.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:57.180
Well, that's not very often in your life, apparently.

01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.180
Savannah.

01:09:58.180 --> 01:09:59.180
Nice to meet you.

01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:00.180
Savannah with one N.

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:01.620
Um, what, uh, Zach, what were you going to say?

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:05.900
You said, cause it just cause I'm curious, cause I said, I made the dumb Nazi joke about

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.380
your shaved head for those who are listening.

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:08.380
He has a shaved head.

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:11.180
Uh, and you said it's not to beat the heat and you didn't finish.

01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:17.300
Well, I actually, I like it, it's just simply because I don't want to have a receding hairline.

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:20.180
Um, and I've got like a little bald spot back here.

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:24.500
I'm actually like, I'm about three days past the last time I shaved my head.

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.900
So you can start to see it a little bit.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:31.860
Where do you do, how do you, do you go, do you go to a barber or do you just do it yourself

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:32.860
now?

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:37.420
No, I just, I just put shaving cream on and so you got one of those like mock 17 blade.

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:38.420
Oh, right.

01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.940
Do you, do you, do you pick it like, like, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's, that seems

01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:43.420
like a tremendous effort.

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:48.700
I, I, it's not really, it's really, it's really easy and very satisfying to imagine.

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:57.460
Like every fucking conceivable razor, no, I'm holding like a BIC, like a, no, not one

01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:58.460
of them.

01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:02.620
Like I've got like the mock or Gillette, Gillette, something that it's got like a, like a, like

01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:06.820
a rotating ball that has a bunch of a phantasm 2000.

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:07.820
Yes.

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:08.820
Yes.

01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:09.820
It is.

01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:10.820
Oh boy.

01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:16.180
First, the first metal ball comes in and terrorizes your soul.

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:21.060
The second ball kidnaps your body, fills it with formaldehyde and fuck it.

01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.060
Yeah.

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:23.660
How many of those balls were there?

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:24.660
I just remember.

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:25.660
Three.

01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:26.660
There were three of them.

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:27.660
There were three.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:28.660
I only ever saw phantasm too.

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:29.860
Which was fucked up.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.900
I thought, I was, I was going to a movie theater.

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:36.940
I was a kid and it was a radar movie and I was with adults, meaning like my brother's

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:41.180
friends and like, um, I didn't know the word phantasm.

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:44.060
I was confusing it with, uh, Phantasia.

01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.060
Oh.

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:48.780
And so I was like, why are we going to see phantasm too?

01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:52.740
Who cares what happened to those broomsticks?

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:55.260
Clearly the lesson was don't play with magic when the wizard's gone.

01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:59.500
I don't, I think that lesson is like learned and I was like, what the hell's going on?

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:00.500
But I just want to fit in.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.980
And then it was a fucking crazy, really cool horror movie.

01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:04.980
Phantasm too.

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:08.420
Imagine if the tall man had one of the, had like the, the outfit that Mickey was wearing

01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:09.420
with the hat.

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:10.660
It would have been even better.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:14.620
How is that the, what are the rules there when you just put on a fucking hat and all

01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:18.300
of a sudden you can make animated golems and shit out of brooms?

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:21.300
I think he had a book, I think a spell book.

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.300
He just touched.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.800
Oh wait, maybe he did.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.300
All right.

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:26.300
That tracks.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:32.180
I always thought that was like high level magic he was tabbing it to.

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:33.180
Hard to believe.

01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:34.180
Well, it was pretty.

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:36.340
I mean, he made an army of self replicating broom men.

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:37.340
Yeah.

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.340
That's crazy.

01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:40.380
But then he, he gets more than he bargained for at some point, right?

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:42.820
Oh, an army of self replicating broom men.

01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.580
That's how magic, that's what magic does.

01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.660
It's always more than what you bargained for.

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.460
That's what it says on the cover of that book.

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:49.460
Yeah.

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:50.460
All right.

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:55.060
So what's your, what are your thoughts about like, and, and listen, bonus points for if

01:12:55.060 --> 01:13:01.380
you have thought about taking it into the Balboa specificity.

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:05.700
How do I move, how do I move asses into seats for the, for July 22nd?

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:07.060
Well, I'm in, I'm in advertising.

01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.300
I'm in digital advertising.

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:09.300
So I designed.

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:10.300
Fingers.

01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:11.300
Fingers.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:12.300
And fingers.

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.300
Digital fingers.

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:14.300
Digits.

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:17.300
I think it's the easiest because you're like, Hey, you have 10 of them.

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:18.300
Yeah.

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:19.300
Why not?

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:20.300
Why not?

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:21.300
Why not?

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:22.300
Why not 11?

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:23.300
Yeah.

01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:24.300
That's all.

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:25.300
I mean, digital advertising is essentially this.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.300
Sorry.

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.300
I'm so sorry.

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.300
Here they are.

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:29.300
They're all here.

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:30.300
Sorry.

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:31.300
All 10 of them.

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.300
Sorry.

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:33.300
Zach, just pretend Dan's not here.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.300
Too late.

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:43.940
So you shave your head, but you leave the beard.

01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:45.940
This is how I produce a jawline.

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:48.380
I know what you mean, man.

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.380
If I don't have this, I look like a Muppet.

01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:51.380
Yeah.

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:52.900
What does that term neck beard mean?

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:55.940
You know, I always get so scared because it's like, it's when there's no defining

01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:58.780
line underneath, but that's good.

01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:03.820
I mean, you have made a defining line, but if you have a good, strong jawline, if you're

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:10.580
like Jay Cutler from the Bears, who's right, who can do that and get away with it when

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:13.620
it's bad, it looks kind of like a main leg.

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:18.540
You're just a fat lion.

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:20.620
Like it's really, it's not a beard on your chin.

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:24.220
It's like this hairy ring around your neck.

01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:26.740
That's like the failure of the neck beard, I think.

01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:27.740
Yeah.

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:32.420
So Zach, when you're doing the beard, is that all razor?

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:33.660
Are you doing electric around there?

01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:34.660
How do you?

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:35.660
Oh, no.

01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:36.660
This is laser precise.

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:37.660
This is with a bit too.

01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:38.660
Really?

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:39.660
So you just...

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:40.660
I actually have two razors that I use.

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:44.380
I have a ball, Gillette, 17 blade thing for this, and the big for this.

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:47.700
Am I wrong in saying exactly you also go on top of the mustache?

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:48.700
Yes.

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:57.300
I've had a beard since I was about three years old, so I've been able to perfect the grooming

01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:58.300
of...

01:14:58.300 --> 01:14:59.300
Well, then let me ask you this.

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:00.300
I can't grow a nice mustache or a beard.

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:03.820
I have very splotchy, patchy, Johnny Depp used car sales.

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.220
Well, you have a very beautiful face.

01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.220
You don't need to have...

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:11.260
And facial hair, I think, is for people that are kind of ashamed of their face, like I

01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:12.260
am.

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:17.420
But you're a very handsome guy, Zach.

01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:19.020
I've got a great beard.

01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:20.020
Are you saying if you...

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:21.020
But you have great hair.

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:24.020
Are you saying if we saw you without that beard that we would go like, oh, my God.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.020
Yeah, I wouldn't be up here.

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.020
Have you ever seen...

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:31.500
Don't you get a little mad when you see, well, like Daniel Gilley's last week, he had a beard.

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:35.740
Like when handsome guys have beards, like it is not like it pisses you off.

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:41.980
It's like, you can tell that it's like, yeah, it is weird.

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:44.660
It's like, it almost looks like they're in disguise.

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:48.580
It's the whole, like, lumberjack, like, lumbersexual thing that goes on.

01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:49.580
Lumbersexual.

01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:53.460
Yeah, I kind of have to, I've named it into mannequins.

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:54.460
I'm kind of a lumbersexual.

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:55.460
Do you guys...

01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:59.180
It's just a leg, though, right?

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:00.180
I just got...

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:03.940
I got this haircut because I was on Larry King now.

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:11.460
It's like, TV guy, magazine.

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:19.940
I got a haircut because I was going to be on Webisodes of what used to be TV, and I thought

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:24.060
it was a great haircut, and then Cody was laughing because she said that in the back,

01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:30.940
he made me look like a Lego.

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:31.940
I saw that.

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:34.180
It's a little too precise.

01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.180
She's like, really?

01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:37.340
She was like, taking pictures of me from behind.

01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.460
She wanted to do a split screen with, like, a Lego guy.

01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:45.260
Yeah, I guess I looked at it, and I was like, yeah, I guess I was pretty straight, and he

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:46.260
did that.

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:48.140
But, I mean, I would have never...

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:49.140
All right.

01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:52.180
All right, so digital advertising, what do you think?

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:55.380
What do we do to get some butts in the Balboas?

01:16:55.380 --> 01:17:00.860
My initial instinct is to think visually when advertising, and you've got three strapping

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:06.420
young men up here that are part of the podcast, that I think we just do a shot with you guys

01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:10.500
in the same outfits that they're wearing, and now you see me.

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:15.820
I don't think that's gonna...

01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:16.820
I mean...

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:17.820
It is...

01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:18.820
It's a...

01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:19.820
You listen to it.

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:20.820
Yeah.

01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:21.820
It's a podcast.

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:22.820
You know, it's just like a...

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:25.300
We don't have a budget for, like, a bus stop ad.

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:29.700
I'm gonna say, like, all I can think of is bribery, like, show up.

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:30.700
That's what I'm saying.

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:31.700
Prizes.

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.420
Or it also promises, like, okay, so sometimes when we go abroad...

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:35.420
We'll build a wall.

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:41.140
Like, and go, like, well, sometimes, you know, sometimes the traveling shows are the drunkest

01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:42.140
of all.

01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:46.140
Like, maybe, what if it was like, okay, I promise you, like, what are some features

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:47.140
of a show?

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:51.260
Like, I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna be drunk, but I will say I won't be blackout drunk when

01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:54.460
I take the stage, and I...

01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:58.660
And to prove that I'll prepare bits, like, what's like a bit?

01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:06.620
If I were to do Savannah, if I were to do bits, like, top ten lists, or like, what kind of...

01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:10.140
What could come out of the Harmontown psyche that you think would be, like, a good, like,

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:20.060
kind of feature that you, like, you know, like, Harmon's thoughts or, you know, like,

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.060
I'm putting you on the spot.

01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:22.060
Oh, no, that's okay.

01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:27.100
Well, from the Comic Con show last year, like, kind of going over some of the things you

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:32.300
saw at Comic Con that maybe you could, you know, then talk about for an extended period

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:33.300
of time.

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:37.860
So maybe your top ten worst moments at Comic Con are the moments that made you cringe,

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:39.300
or moments that really made you...

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:42.500
I think, Dan, you should dress as Poison Ivy.

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:48.020
But, again, that's not, I mean, they're gonna be like, okay, cool, dress like Poison Ivy.

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:49.540
I'll look that up on...

01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:53.100
If you can guarantee, like, guests, but maybe don't say exactly who they are, but, like,

01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:57.060
kind of give hints as to who they might be that are vague enough that people won't be

01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:58.060
disappointed.

01:18:58.060 --> 01:18:59.060
Yeah, that's what we do, Dan.

01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:00.060
You just...

01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:01.060
We just say that we have an awesome guest.

01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:05.820
And also, Spencer and I are both gonna dress as Slave Leia.

01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:06.820
And Star...

01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:07.820
Yeah.

01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:11.060
And Star Wars 8 is gonna make an appearance.

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:14.580
Curtis Armstrong will text...

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:15.580
Will text Curtis Armstrong.

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:16.580
I heard him say...

01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:17.580
Yeah!

01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.580
By the way, where is Curtis?

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:20.580
Have we lost him forever?

01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:21.580
What's going on?

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.580
Thank you, Zach.

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:23.580
Where...

01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:24.580
What happened to Curtis?

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:26.580
He said some racist shit to me in the parking lot.

01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:27.580
Oh, no.

01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:31.260
And I was like, dude, that's cool, but, like, people should know you're racist, and he's

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:36.460
like, I don't care about my image, Dan.

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:38.580
And I said, yes, you do.

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:44.220
And he said, he's like, no, dude!

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:50.060
People with different colored skin for me are less people.

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:55.300
And I was like, Curtis, if anyone could hear you saying this right now, they'd be so broken-hearted.

01:19:55.300 --> 01:20:04.340
And he said, that's the point, baby!

01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:07.140
That guy and Christopher Walken sound the exact same.

01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:08.140
The exact same.

01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:09.140
All right.

01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:10.140
Wait.

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:11.300
Curtis Armstrong, I think I only have...

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:12.820
Zach, do you have any impressions?

01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:16.460
I had a party, like, who can you break out as an impression?

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:17.460
It hasn't been on the show.

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:19.300
I mean, I could do a slight walk-in, but it...

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:20.300
Give me a slight walk-in.

01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:22.300
Can you give me a slight walk-in ordering breakfast?

01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:26.020
Okay, well, Levy, make sure Curtis Armstrong is... make sure we connect with him and see

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:28.540
if he can do the show at the Balboa.

01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:29.540
And I'll pay him.

01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:34.380
Tell him he's got us over a barrel.

01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.380
And then if you come...

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.380
All right.

01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:37.860
If you come to the Balboa show...

01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:40.860
Which you shouldn't.

01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:47.060
Guaranteed photograph and...

01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:48.060
Parking lot.

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:49.060
Parking lot.

01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:50.060
HJs.

01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:51.060
I want...

01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:56.420
I never really do this except at this show anyway, but when we go out of town, I usually...

01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:59.180
Well, actually, I've been entering a phase where I'm kind of like, yeah, I don't want

01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:00.180
to do the...

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:01.180
Yeah, I think.

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:06.900
So, guaranteed, for sure, no matter how many of you show up at the Balboa, if you paid

01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:12.180
to get in, then part of that price is you're guaranteed, we'll have to figure out where

01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:15.220
to go possibly, maybe they'll need the theater.

01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:17.700
But I'll do a whole line thing or...

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:18.700
Taco is at El Gordo.

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:21.180
Figure out how you get a picture, you get a picture.

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:22.180
It sounds presumptuous.

01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:25.140
I've tried to understand him as a writer, so it sounds weird to try to sell that, like,

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:26.540
because it's like a thing.

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:27.540
But that would be...

01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:30.500
That to me is like a basic thing, like, oh, it's $24.

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:31.940
We're driving to San Diego.

01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:36.060
I'm definitely going to get a photograph, for sure.

01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:37.060
In good lighting.

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:39.580
Why are you shaking your head, Steve?

01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:47.060
Oh, because it's a thousand people, and it'll take technically until Monday to do it.

01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:49.860
Well, I've done it before.

01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:57.660
Say you're going to debut the Justice League trailer, and make a fake Justice League trailer,

01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:58.660
and...

01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:00.340
Oh, I can show something.

01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:01.340
Write that down.

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:09.300
Let me bring like a Rick and Morty clip, like, in secret.

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:10.300
Let's...

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:14.340
Because it's right before we drop all the Harmon Quest episodes, let's just show all the Harmon

01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:15.340
Quest episodes.

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:16.340
It'll be after.

01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:19.780
We even know CISO's not coming to that, and they have no part of it.

01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:28.100
Comic-Con's after we drop Harmon Quest, speaking of which, we just wrapped Harmon Quest.

01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:35.140
11 days, 11 days until you got to get CISO.

01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:36.940
All right.

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:46.300
If you come to the Balboa Theater on July 22nd, I will be there on stage.

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:49.620
Do you think they have, like, airplay, like, capability?

01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:52.780
Like, do you think we could get them to do, like, a projection thing?

01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:53.780
All right.

01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:54.780
No, we can.

01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:55.780
We'll look into this.

01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:56.780
No, we'll do that.

01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:57.780
I will...

01:22:57.780 --> 01:22:58.780
I'll...

01:22:58.780 --> 01:22:59.780
I'll write...

01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:03.660
I'll write...

01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:07.660
A special Comic-Con episode of Rick and Morty.

01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:08.660
Live.

01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:10.780
No, it should be more...

01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:11.780
I'm sorry.

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:12.780
Like, I'll write...

01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:15.780
I'll write the community movie, like, like, gotta...

01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:20.820
Or, like, the first act of it, or I'll get as much through it as I can while you watch.

01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:22.820
I'll start, like...

01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:25.780
You'll just see the final drafts up on the screen.

01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:31.660
Yeah, like, fade in, and, like, I'll start writing the community movie until the show

01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:32.660
starts.

01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:33.660
Yeah, yeah.

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:34.660
And I will...

01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:35.660
Yeah.

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:36.660
I like that.

01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:37.660
And then prizes.

01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:44.580
And then there'll be prizes, and Spencer's gonna dress as Poison Ivy, Savannah's gonna

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:48.180
be there, like, doing, like, a Cirque du Soleil thing.

01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:50.780
She'll do her aerial ribbon act.

01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:51.780
It's amazing.

01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:52.780
You have to see it.

01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:53.780
All right.

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:56.780
Well, thanks to our PR department, Savannah.

01:23:56.780 --> 01:24:00.780
Zach and Savannah, please.

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:03.100
All right.

01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:04.100
Thank you.

01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.100
Thank you.

01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:06.100
Thank you.

01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:07.100
Thank you.

01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:11.620
What a great generation, Jeff.

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:12.860
Thank you, Zach.

01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:13.860
You know?

01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:19.500
I don't say these millennials that they're pieces of shit.

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:20.500
I don't see it.

01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:23.340
But you fundamentally disagree with that.

01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:24.340
Yeah, I do.

01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:25.340
I see hope in them.

01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:28.900
What do you think separates the millennials from our generation?

01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:33.980
I think, you know, I think they're more dishonest about how racist they are.

01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:38.060
They've found new ways to tap dance around it.

01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:45.940
They're the Baryshnikovs of actual racism.

01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:53.580
They come to the table more apple-compatible, for sure.

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:56.860
That's always good.

01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:01.860
I don't think they're worried about Y2K as much as my generation did.

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:05.260
Do you want to come up here?

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:06.260
Yeah.

01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:08.260
Yeah, yeah, you can't see.

01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:09.260
All right.

01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:10.260
All right.

01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:15.260
Please welcome my co-worker, John Eidzen.

01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:16.260
Eidzen.

01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:25.020
Is it just Eidzen?

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:26.660
It's Edzen, actually.

01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:28.420
Where's the I?

01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:29.420
It's silent.

01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:30.420
Yeah.

01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:31.420
Yeah.

01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:32.420
All right.

01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.420
Your last name is E-I-D-S-O-N.

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:34.420
Mm-hmm.

01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:35.420
Where's your buddy?

01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:40.100
Well, he's off in Tahoe for 4th of July, so he's going to be very sad that he wasn't

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:41.100
here.

01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:43.620
John, whose name I just learned isn't his partner's name, Nick.

01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:46.220
You're really selling that I'm a co-worker here.

01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:47.220
Yeah.

01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:54.460
He's, we sold an idea to FX called Happy City, which is going to be like, it's like a Thomas

01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:59.460
the Tank Engine kind of thing, but it's like, it's friends and they're hanging out.

01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:04.660
Yeah, it's a taxi and a helicopter and an ambulance and another taxi.

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:05.660
Yeah.

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:06.660
Yeah.

01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:08.580
And they hang out.

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:09.580
They're millennial vehicles.

01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:11.260
I think they're sold on it already.

01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:17.060
In the big city, Happy City, and it's hard to be in the Happy City, especially when like

01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:22.900
one of the characters, and I'm not going to spoil it, it's Tyler the Taxi.

01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:24.900
You're not that happy.

01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:26.940
Oh, shit.

01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:31.540
But really it's just, we've been calling it friends or Seinfeld without arms.

01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:32.540
Yeah.

01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:33.540
Yeah.

01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:37.580
When we sold the show, I don't think we realized how hard it was going to be to write for characters

01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:40.860
that can't pick things up.

01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:45.140
You wouldn't believe how many fucking conversations we had.

01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:46.140
That's the thing.

01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:54.420
People don't understand tonality in television is this totally fractal, continuum-based thing.

01:26:54.420 --> 01:27:01.900
There is no, oh, is it going to be funny like Chappelle's show, or is there going to be

01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:04.900
funny like Larry Sanders?

01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:08.580
It's like, no, it's like, there's questions that you don't know that you don't have the

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:10.140
answers to until you ask them.

01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:14.540
For instance, on Rick and Morty, the whole big decision we had to make when we were writing

01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:18.820
the pilot for Rick and Morty, Justin and I, we had to have like a three-hour conversation,

01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:26.460
and the end of it all was just saying, look, I don't know how to define the rules of the

01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:31.340
universe, but we're just going to say, if a kid comes through a portal into his high

01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:37.180
school cafeteria, it doesn't change his social status within the high school.

01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:39.900
It's more like he came in on a skateboard.

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:43.900
He came in through the portal, but he fell down.

01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:48.660
The cute girl that he has a crush on says, did you just come through a portal?

01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:50.140
Did you just do that?

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:53.300
But she doesn't mean like, is there a God?

01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:55.700
Are you the Messiah?

01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:56.700
Does this change everything?

01:27:56.700 --> 01:28:00.820
It's not even like pulling up in a Ferrari in the 80s.

01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:05.220
It's just like, so you make these decisions, so we had to make the decision that these

01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:12.100
are cars and helicopters and fire trucks and shit, and everything's alive, but they have

01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:13.100
to have apartments.

01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:17.580
But the apartments also have to have personalities.

01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:23.900
So yeah, if you come to this show with questions about internal logic, you're purposely fucked.

01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:26.260
Yeah, I'll leave your logic at the door.

01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:29.580
Donnie the door.

01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:32.260
Are other things than humans and vehicles alive?

01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:34.100
Like, yeah, the whole city is alive.

01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:36.100
Yeah, there's people.

01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:37.100
Yeah.

01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:44.900
But we kind of see the people like flies or like horses see flies and just kind of brushing

01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:45.900
them off.

01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:46.900
Yeah.

01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:50.740
So like taxis, like take them and dump them off or like, but like, yeah, like if your

01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:56.380
friend's in the ambulance and then he's like, hey, hey Tyler, do you want, do you want some

01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:57.380
people?

01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:01.100
Yeah, I do, that's my job and then like he pulls up and like put, throws some people

01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:05.620
from the ambulance into the taxi, but then your boss will yell at you about that later

01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:07.660
because you're not supposed to do that.

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:10.780
Like an ambulance is supposed to take the people to the hospital.

01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:13.660
You're not supposed to just because you're a taxi take people out of an ambulance.

01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:15.660
And the hospital also being a character.

01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:19.060
Let's say it's just two cars hanging out like the best friends.

01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:21.580
Do they go out to a restaurant and sit at a car restaurant?

01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:22.580
Yes.

01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:23.580
But it's not a car restaurant.

01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:24.580
It's just a restaurant.

01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:25.940
Because they're not drinking motor oil.

01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:28.380
They're eating pancakes and floating drinks to their faces.

01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:29.380
How are they seated?

01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:30.380
Like, are they seated?

01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:35.060
Like, I'll pull up to the table, but then, but then if there's like a, you know, we had

01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:39.260
a long time because like if somebody's like, if somebody's talking and it's like clear,

01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:42.500
like if there's a subplot about like, well, I think that person might be gay, but they're

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:43.500
not admitting it yet.

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:46.260
And then there's these two people have been talking about it, but this person says something

01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:50.340
that this person, this car and this, the helicopter is like, like saying something.

01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:54.340
But then you pan over to the other taxi and they don't have arms.

01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:57.420
So there's just a knife and fork floating in front of them.

01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:03.020
But their eyes are going, which is a universal language.

01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:04.020
Yeah.

01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:05.420
It's like, like, like they don't have arms.

01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:10.780
So it's just a knife and fork floating, but they're going, you know, see, somebody's

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:11.780
gay apartment.

01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:16.300
Is it, is there like a shot of a car just laying in bed like, like wondering what he's

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:17.300
doing with his life?

01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:19.700
If he's sick, if the car is sick, does he, is he in bed?

01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:24.020
We haven't, I guess so, I feel like we're going to have to get back to you on that

01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:25.020
note.

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:27.500
Because the alternative would be that he's at Jiffy Lube and it's dumb.

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:28.500
Yeah.

01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.140
Once you start Yankevicking it, you're fucked.

01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:31.140
Yeah.

01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:36.620
Initially, initially we pictured them going into houses or apartments and then going to

01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:41.100
their rooms and they have a little garage inside of their room that they go into, which

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.140
became a little too cute, I think.

01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:44.140
Yeah.

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:47.660
So now I was saying for a while, well, when they hang out, they should just be at an

01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:48.660
intersection.

01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:52.700
Like, yeah, but then it's like, well, how many episodes of this are we going to do and

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:57.780
how much of a 25-year-old's life is about cohabitation and about landlord conflict and

01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:02.060
about property value and like, aren't they going to get texts and like, and for a while

01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:03.980
I was like, well, maybe they don't get texts.

01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:08.740
Let's rise above it and like, but I was like, there's no fucking way, like the cars just

01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:12.740
have phones that'll just float out in front of them and then they'll text each other and

01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:13.740
they live in apartments.

01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:18.540
If the cars, let's say one of your main characters is a car and goes to like, would they go to

01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:19.540
a rock concert?

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:22.620
And if they go to the rock concert, would it all just be cars, or would there be people

01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:24.140
there too, or just cars?

01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:28.580
There would be people, like if you squint or freeze frame, there would be people climbing

01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:29.580
all over the place.

01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:33.900
Because like, there is a plane of the universe where this show is actually about the people

01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:38.700
who don't understand why their cars are doing all this.

01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:43.500
But we had a long time where I was saying, oh, you have to hold it up to both realities

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:47.940
where every episode, if you watch every frame, you like, everything makes sense in some weird

01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:52.980
way that like, like the way that we're controlled by brain chemicals.

01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:55.700
So I was like, why did that guy take a hatchet to his family?

01:31:55.700 --> 01:32:00.180
Well, like, like because he's fucking, he's schizophrenic, but also had a little bit, just

01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:01.420
a touch of Asperger's.

01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:02.900
And then it was Tuesday.

01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:08.380
And so, but, but the truth is like some forensic files, there's just like, you know, it's like,

01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:11.180
how much control, what is the difference between free will and destiny?

01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:12.780
And we don't, we don't really know.

01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:14.420
We just feel like we're making these choices.

01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:18.100
So why wouldn't these cars just feel like they're having these stories where they're

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.100
like, fuck you, buddy.

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:20.100
And then they drive away.

01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:24.940
But in reality, on the people's side, if you look at it, you can see two tiny people

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.940
that are like mad at each other as well.

01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:28.940
And like, but I think we let that go.

01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:29.940
Yeah.

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:33.580
Now it's just cars that go to a rock concert, probably, and there's people like just climbing

01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:34.580
all over the place.

01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:36.980
Maybe we'll have the Easter egg of what the people are doing.

01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:41.380
But ultimately, I think it's kind of that maybe the team America thing of how do the

01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:43.140
cars play basketball?

01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:44.140
Let's figure it out.

01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.140
We haven't made it yet.

01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.140
So that's going to be the next step.

01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:47.820
So the cars are playing basketball.

01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:49.740
What is the diameter of the basketball?

01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:50.740
Who made the basketball?

01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:53.100
These are like, no, it's just a car.

01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:54.780
It's proportionate to the car.

01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:58.340
So like, oh, if a person got out of that car, that'd be a giant basketball.

01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:00.780
No, it's a basketball for the cars.

01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:01.900
It's dribbling next to them.

01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:04.340
They have no arm.

01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:05.340
Deal with it.

01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:08.820
And the way we're dealing with it is we're going to have a live action mayor.

01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:09.820
Yeah, we got it.

01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:10.820
We got it.

01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:11.820
I think we should put out the call right now.

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:13.820
We'd like it to be Michael Shannon, actor Michael Shannon.

01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:18.460
If anyone knows him.

01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:22.540
In between scenes, we'd like to just go back to the mayor's office and have fucking freaky

01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:29.700
Michael Shannon just intensely ask a lot of the questions that you were about to ask

01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:35.820
and then answer them with like, I don't know, being mayor doesn't mean I'm in control.

01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:40.620
All I know is that when two friends are jealous of a third friend, like the shit goes down,

01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:45.340
the stories are held together by emotional, because also, like, guess what, when you're

01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:48.740
watching Seinfeld, why does everybody always sit on one side of the table?

01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:51.980
I mean, you can't turn you back to the camera.

01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:56.580
It's just as unnatural as if everyone was cars.

01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:59.740
There's always a reason why everything's fucking weird and you have to, like, maybe

01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:00.740
we're all cars.

01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:02.220
Maybe we are all cars.

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.220
That's what the show makes you ask.

01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:05.340
How often do you wonder where a basketball came from?

01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:06.340
Yeah.

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.340
Yeah, why?

01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:08.340
Yeah.

01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:09.340
Who made this orange?

01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:10.340
Yeah.

01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:11.340
Did they answer that?

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:12.340
Yeah.

01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:13.340
Yeah.

01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:14.340
Did they answer your question?

01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:15.340
Yeah, it does.

01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:16.340
I think it's going to be really good show.

01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:17.340
So are we still writing it?

01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:22.980
I want to watch the show, because also, like, I want to watch that show and wonder, I want

01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:26.460
to have a lot of questions about it, and I want to find out that they're not going to

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:29.340
be answered or they're going to be answered very slowly or...

01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:30.900
Yeah, remember ABC's Cavemen?

01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:31.900
Yes, I do.

01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:36.580
Like, that show could have lasted a hundred episodes if it had just accepted that it was

01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:37.580
fucked up.

01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:38.580
It was fucked up.

01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:39.580
Yeah.

01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:46.180
And I still have the pilot that never aired of Cavemen, which was way more racist, where

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:52.260
the Cavemen were really good dancers and had big dicks and had lots of rhythm and stuff

01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:54.780
like that.

01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:57.140
They dropped that for the unerring pilot.

01:34:57.140 --> 01:35:01.540
Okay, here's what we do, about both theater, July 22nd.

01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:05.180
You're going to have to raise those same prizes.

01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:08.140
We show the unerred pilot of Cavemen.

01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:16.060
Holy smoke, they asked me to audition for that one, and I declined.

01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:19.140
Even Saturday night, I know a lot of people auditioned for Cavemen and didn't get the

01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:20.140
job.

01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:26.300
Well, Nick Kroll did, and he was really, that's how I met Nick Kroll, I found out he was the

01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:31.180
smart Caveman in Cavemen, he was the one with the glasses, and I asked him 500 Cavemen questions,

01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:32.700
he answered every single one.

01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:37.220
It was the first time I'd ever met him, and I was like, that guy's cool, man.

01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:38.220
He did not.

01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:39.220
Yeah.

01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:44.220
Cavemen's worth a look, it's worth watching, what was it, four episodes, how many did they

01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:45.220
make?

01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:47.220
I think like four aired, they probably made six.

01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:50.020
It is fucking bonkers.

01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:51.020
What year was this?

01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:52.020
I don't know.

01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:53.020
Wow.

01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:57.860
I think someone from the cast is here.

01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:02.500
2006 sounds good, sounds like the year.

01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:06.220
Yeah, it's fucking, I have it at my place, please come over and watch it with me, it's

01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:07.220
really good.

01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:08.220
All thousand people.

01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:12.860
You know, I treat yourself, find the pilot to Mr. Edd.

01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:16.580
It's one of the funniest goddamn half hours of TV you'll ever see in your life.

01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:21.020
So John, tell everybody that I'm fun to work with.

01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:22.820
I wasn't done with Mr. Edd, dad.

01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:26.140
Well, I'm not fun, but just tell him it's amazing to work with me.

01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:27.740
It's so amazing.

01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:28.820
For example.

01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:37.220
At his house, you're greeted by his dogs immediately, did you get peed on?

01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:38.220
Just a little.

01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:39.220
Yeah.

01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:40.220
Just a little.

01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:42.420
Well, Harvey growls at me a lot.

01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:43.420
But he doesn't know what growl means.

01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:44.420
But he doesn't know what that means.

01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:45.420
He thinks it means play with me.

01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:48.700
Oh, sorry, I wasn't selling this well enough.

01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:49.700
No, no.

01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:54.540
Well, there is the Apple TV thing, like, because I tried to put up on the screen and then I

01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:55.540
was like.

01:36:55.540 --> 01:37:00.980
You know, embarrassing things pop up whenever Dan turns his Apple TV on, started taking

01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:09.540
photos to Dan's shame of the Kelly Clarkson songs revealed of last played on the Apple

01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:10.540
TV.

01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:11.540
That's fun.

01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:12.540
We have a good laugh about that.

01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:13.540
Yeah.

01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:14.540
Welcome, guys.

01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:15.540
All right.

01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:16.540
Let's open a laptop.

01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:17.540
Apple TV is not working.

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:20.820
It'll be bitching about it for a while, like squaring and going like, fuck the technology.

01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:21.820
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:23.940
He's got a fish tank that he's still learning how to work.

01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:28.460
Then comes up and it says Kelly Clarkson, whatever makes you stronger, whatever the fuck it

01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:29.460
is.

01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:35.620
And it's like, as Nick pointed out, the progress indicator is five seconds before the end of

01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:40.380
the song, which means like, it's like, there's unmistakings, like there's nothing you could

01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:41.380
do.

01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:42.380
You could never get out of it.

01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:43.380
Yeah.

01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:44.380
There's no, I got hacked.

01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:45.380
My account got hacked.

01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:52.860
No, you listened to the song, you danced to it and you're underwear and then the doorball

01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:53.860
rang.

01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:54.860
How are the fish doing?

01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:55.860
Are the fish thriving?

01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:58.940
He has a hard time dealing with the light.

01:37:58.940 --> 01:37:59.940
That's okay now.

01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:00.940
Yeah.

01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:01.940
Oh, okay.

01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:02.940
Good.

01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:03.940
Thank God for Golan.

01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:04.940
Yeah.

01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:05.940
Golan, the fish guy.

01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:06.940
He's important to the household.

01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:07.940
Yeah.

01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:11.380
I'm a dick to the aquarium guy.

01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:13.100
Didn't he steal the remote?

01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:16.460
Wasn't there a hubbub with this remote?

01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:19.900
The light didn't work for a while and he didn't tell me he had to open the cabinet in order

01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:23.420
for the remote for the light on the fish tank to work.

01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:30.620
That means it's not a remote.

01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:35.500
It's a detachable button pad.

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:38.660
Because if you have to open the, I mean, not that I needed it to be remote.

01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:44.060
I'd love a button under the cabinet that just turns the light on so you can see the fish.

01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:46.700
The fish have a light cycle.

01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:53.620
Once the fish live their natural life in a two-foot tank, they'd go crazy going like,

01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:55.300
why isn't it morning yet?

01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:57.780
Why is it nighttime?

01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:01.580
So it goes around a cycle, but the only time people are going to come over to my place

01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:04.940
and see the fish, it's there in their nighttime.

01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:06.740
So it's a black tank.

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:14.180
So they want to hit a button and go, there's the fish, look, there's a prawn.

01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:16.860
So I went back and forth with this guy, and I'm a huge dick.

01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:18.860
I read one of my texts when I was going through the divorce.

01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:21.340
I did this whole, it was like, I don't work that.

01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:23.180
Yeah, you were like, quoting Edward Albee.

01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:28.860
Well, while you were there, yeah, I said, this was the most, I said, like, because it

01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:31.780
was like the fifth time I asked about the remote not working for the light.

01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:36.860
And then I tagged it with a generic, if you ever want to just like be a dick that seems

01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:42.180
intellectual, I said, I feel like I'm in an Edward Albee play.

01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:44.900
Which one?

01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:49.300
Who's turned in the tank on?

01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:52.380
And then he was like, no, and he called me and he's like, he's going to open the door.

01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:57.460
It's not a good way to end the show.

01:39:57.460 --> 01:40:00.460
So it sounds like a lot of people are going to watch on FX when we have our Happy City

01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:03.940
show.

01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:07.060
After they pick it up, after we turn in the script, we've got some work to do.

01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:13.620
So I keep pushing the meetings where I have to do a pass on the script.

01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:16.940
But John, what's your least favorite thing about working with Dan?

01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:23.580
What's the downside to working with Dan Harmon?

01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:24.580
His unavailability.

01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:28.060
Oh, because you want more of me.

01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:29.060
Yeah.

01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:30.060
Wait, that makes sense.

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:31.060
No, that's a scarcity.

01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:33.060
I'm going to stick with that.

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:36.300
Now you're a busy man.

01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:39.380
You're a hard worker.

01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:42.260
You guys are all lucky to be getting his time right now.

01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:45.540
I fight before it sometimes, I think.

01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:46.540
That's true.

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:48.660
It's not a joke.

01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:51.220
You guys are delightful, by the way.

01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:54.940
These guys, they were YouTubers.

01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:57.820
Consimate good sports, these guys.

01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:03.100
They haven't been in the TV world yet.

01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:06.140
Something like indoctrinating them into like, no, you just got to write a shitty script.

01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:10.620
It was terrifying for you guys, but you guys are like fucking churning shit out.

01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:13.100
We did what you said we don't.

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:16.140
You guys are doing shit that does not feel good for you to do because I asked you to

01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:17.140
do it.

01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:18.620
And you're getting punished for it.

01:41:18.620 --> 01:41:19.620
That's great.

01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:20.620
No.

01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:21.620
No.

01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:23.060
I mean, to be honest, it's been awesome.

01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:29.700
We just got the absolute luck of getting to pitch Dan this idea that you liked enough

01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:33.580
to take out with us, and we've been learning so much from you.

01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:34.580
It's been awesome.

01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:37.060
I mean, we watched community from the beginning.

01:41:37.060 --> 01:41:38.060
We've watched all your stuff.

01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:39.060
So to be learning.

01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:43.100
If he's abusing you, just blink twice.

01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:49.580
But yeah, no, it's great.

01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:50.580
It's been awesome.

01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:51.580
I'm a good person.

01:41:51.580 --> 01:42:03.540
I have a reputation for not, and I don't know why I'm not in a better mood because tonight,

01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:05.660
I usually have work tomorrow when I come to the show.

01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:07.420
I should be in a good mood.

01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:08.700
I have tomorrow off.

01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:13.980
Well, from moment one, honestly, you were so gracious to hear our idea, which I think

01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:18.700
kind of surprised us because we weren't...

01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:21.260
I urged him not to take that meeting.

01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:23.700
I said, these guys are YouTubers.

01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:24.700
It's not worth it.

01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:26.660
They're never going to mount to anything.

01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:29.220
I've probably never wrote a script in their life.

01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:33.020
I feel this is where I've known Dan forever, and he shot down my skateboard TV show where

01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:34.020
everybody was skateboards.

01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:36.020
He didn't like it.

01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:39.380
Well, we took the best parts of that.

01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:41.700
The thing is, my skateboards had arms.

01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:49.100
That's worked out beforehand.

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:50.100
I always...

01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:53.660
The running joke with these guys is I keep pretending that I'm using them to get close

01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:58.700
to PewDiePie, but I have a...

01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:00.020
You bring them up an awful lot.

01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:06.780
I looked on the calendar, there's a PewDiePie meeting coming up.

01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:07.780
Oh, shit.

01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:09.540
PewDiePie's a big fan of Harmontown.

01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:14.100
We can really elevate his craft.

01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:15.100
He's coming in.

01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:16.620
Jeff doesn't know what the PewDiePie is.

01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:17.940
He's just a phenomenon.

01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:20.100
We're currently working with Dan.

01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:22.820
We'll move on to you, I guess, at once.

01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:23.820
Think about it.

01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:27.220
If the Beatles was on YouTube, it's like...

01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:30.100
He's like the Beatles of YouTube.

01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:31.100
He's a video game reviewer.

01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:33.620
It's a perfect analogy.

01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:39.340
He's like the biggest fucking force on that entire place.

01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:40.340
All right.

01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:41.340
Yeah.

01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:42.340
Okay.

01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:46.340
He's the Tim Allen of YouTube in 1998.

01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:50.540
Yeah, he makes noises.

01:43:50.540 --> 01:43:51.940
His name is PewDiePie?

01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:52.940
Yeah.

01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:53.940
PewDiePie.

01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:56.900
He's from foreign place.

01:43:56.900 --> 01:43:57.900
Europe.

01:43:57.900 --> 01:43:58.900
Yeah.

01:43:58.900 --> 01:43:59.900
One of them.

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:00.900
Booking for Comic-Con.

01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:05.900
Yeah, he's going to be at the Balboa Theater.

01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:08.900
He'll be doing autographs.

01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:09.900
July 23rd.

01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:10.900
Take all those photos.

01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:11.900
He's the day after us.

01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:16.580
If I told you guys that PewDiePie was at my Comic-Con show, would you come to the Comic-Con

01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:17.580
show?

01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:20.900
I really thought the audience would be too generous.

01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:21.900
I don't believe that.

01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:23.900
They're going to come and it's just going to be me.

01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:24.900
And you know he's listening because he's a fan.

01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:25.900
And now he's like...

01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:26.900
You know who else is a fan?

01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:27.900
Lin-Mo Manuel Miranda.

01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:33.260
And I started Mad Beef with that guy.

01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:34.260
Well, he wants to...

01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:35.260
He hates me.

01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:36.260
He wants to come on the show.

01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:37.900
No, he wants to tear me apart.

01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:38.900
I don't think so.

01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:39.900
I don't want to see him.

01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:43.900
I'm afraid of what he'll do to me.

01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:44.900
Well, I may...

01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:45.900
And not in a racist way.

01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:48.900
I may have to have him on the show because he wants to come on the show.

01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:52.900
No, it'd be amazing, but I think he really just wants to take me to task.

01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:54.900
I guess it'd be worth it.

01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:55.900
Yeah, it'd be worth it.

01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:56.900
Yeah.

01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:58.900
What did you do to him?

01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:03.900
I said some not nice things about Hamilton.

01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:04.900
Like, I don't get it.

01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.900
It's just rapping.

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:09.900
And then someone was like, that's not very nice.

01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:14.900
I love Lin-Manuel Miranda.

01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:19.900
And then he follows me because he's apparently a huge fan of Harmontown.

01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:22.900
And he sees me tweet and he gets real mad.

01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:23.900
I don't know.

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:24.900
Well, maybe not real mad.

01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:25.900
No, he gets so mad.

01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:26.900
He gets steamed.

01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:29.900
We should have him do a rap battle with Dan.

01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:31.900
Oh, no, I know.

01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:32.900
Yeah.

01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:34.900
I'm so sorry.

01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:39.900
Or is he too chicken?

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:42.900
To come to the Balboa Theater.

01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:44.900
That's what we're trying to...

01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:46.900
On August 4th.

01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:49.900
Let's look into him too for the...

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:54.900
That's our takeaway. A big A-list guest for the Balboa.

01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:55.900
Obviously.

01:45:55.900 --> 01:45:56.900
Yeah.

01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:57.900
Obviously.

01:45:57.900 --> 01:45:58.900
Let's do it.

01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:00.900
What's Felicia Day doing?

01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:02.900
She'll be at the Geek and Sundry lounge.

01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:04.900
We'll be hanging out.

01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:13.900
Because I can get you sherry otary.

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:17.900
Well, what have we learned tonight?

01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:19.900
John.

01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:21.900
What have we learned tonight?

01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:25.900
Oh, man. A lot about the forensic files.

01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:26.900
Puba cares.

01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:29.900
I wonder if there's anything I left off of them.

01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:32.900
Did we learn everything we needed to know about Puba cares?

01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:33.900
They travel.

01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:34.900
Yeah.

01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:36.900
Or migrate.

01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:37.900
Okay.

01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:39.900
What about kid murder?

01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:40.900
How to do it?

01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:43.900
If you want to get away with a murder, the best way to do it is have a boat.

01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:45.900
You got to have your own boat.

01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:49.900
You can't borrow a boat because they go, oh, did you borrow a boat recently?

01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:50.900
Yeah.

01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:52.900
If you're onto that now, though, because now it's like, if you murder...

01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:58.900
I mean, you can't have a boat that you just teleport to, so the docs just have cameras all over them.

01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:04.900
So if you get on the boat with somebody you don't like and you come back alone, that holds up in court.

01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:09.900
Have a boat, own the security cameras like system.

01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:14.900
Also, have a carpet business where you're constantly rolling up carpets and putting them on your boat.

01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:21.900
But you got to do that for like four or three, three, four years of rolling up carpets and putting them on your boat in under the water carpeting.

01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:24.900
There's only one thing we didn't talk about tonight.

01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:29.900
I was talking about selfie sticks and I was asking questions about them and how they worked.

01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:38.900
And then it came around to, we'll skip a couple of steps because it came around to, I started looking it up and I saw that museums were banning selfie sticks in Europe.

01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:45.900
And I was like, yeah, do you really want to be on the side of that snobbery? Aren't American tourists? We're always going to be obnoxious.

01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:50.900
Who knows? Who do you side with in that Mothra versus Gamera fight?

01:47:50.900 --> 01:47:55.900
And then Jeff was saying, I wouldn't allow selfie sticks at my museum.

01:47:55.900 --> 01:48:05.900
And I was like, I know one reason why you shouldn't is because you could use them in an elaborate crown, what do you call it, affair.

01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:12.900
Like your selfie stick is easily, yeah, take it easy. I was testing it. Obviously it's a heist tool.

01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:19.900
You could disguise a selfie stick, you know, you could use a selfie stick to do a lot of Hudson Hawk like painting, grabbing.

01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:20.900
Without question.

01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:28.900
And then Jeff brought up this thing where he said, like, if I had a museum, I would invite people, I would not allow selfie sticks,

01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:33.900
but I would, just to make it clear that it wasn't about that, I would say, go ahead, rob my museum.

01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:37.900
And so then it started me thinking, so here's my pitch.

01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:43.900
Yeah, I challenged it was like, show me what you got. Like I dare you to try to get away with robbing my museum.

01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:48.900
So here's my museum pitch. This is how you make like a profitable museum.

01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:56.900
So you know, every museum has like a gift shop with like key chains and like Chinese finger traps and like fans and like,

01:48:56.900 --> 01:49:02.900
you know, like at the Getty, you go there, you get a Chinese finger trap.

01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:06.900
On the way out.

01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:17.900
So you take that shit, you put it on display in your museum, you fill the gift shop with incredibly expensive heist items.

01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:21.900
Oh, welcome to my teddy bear key chain museum.

01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:24.900
By the way, we encourage you to rob it while you're here.

01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:29.900
Can we interest you in a $5,000 can of laser spray?

01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:36.900
The spray you use to reveal where the lasers are?

01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:41.900
Would you like some Night Vision goggles for $48,000?

01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:44.900
Shouldn't the art there be expensive? We say they use that laser spray.

01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:48.900
No, the art there is it. People are constantly fucking stealing shit.

01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:53.900
They're dangling down on why are you sold them for $50,000 a foot?

01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:57.900
Snatching your teddy bear that costs $3 to replace?

01:49:57.900 --> 01:49:59.900
I'm a genius.

01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:04.900
Wouldn't they take your expensive heist items and go to a museum that had expensive art?

01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:07.900
No, they wouldn't. Well, they have to buy them.

01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:10.900
What this place is, is A, he wants to turn a profit.

01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:12.900
All right.

01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:17.900
You just have an expensive outlet for heist items.

01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:21.900
Yes, and by the way, this isn't for real burglars.

01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:26.900
I mean, they buy their shit wholesale from different people and they rob real museums.

01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:32.900
This is a way for America or, yeah, well, for the tourist to feel the joy.

01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:40.900
I want to be a burglar and our museum boasts, like, you steal what you want, you know?

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:44.900
And then they go, like, oh, shit, they buy, like, these spandex outfits.

01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:50.900
They walk out of their broke and then they rob you for, like, a key chain.

01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:54.900
It's the carnival principle.

01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:57.900
It seems like a bad business model.

01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:04.900
All right, I'll keep making fucking Thomas the Tank Engine spoofs.

01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:08.900
I don't know what's going to get me rich faster.

01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:10.900
All right, well...

01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:13.900
Make friends with PewDiePie, maybe.

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.900
PewDiePie?

01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:16.900
We got to end the show.

01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:18.900
Yeah, yeah, okay, all right.

01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:20.900
What you got, Dan?

01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:27.900
A song about PewDiePie.

01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:56.900
Here's the camera in a high-pitched manner, everybody.

01:51:56.900 --> 01:51:58.900
Okay.

01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:00.900
Day turns into week.

01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:02.900
Cheat, cheat, chute, chute.

01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:03.900
Put your body in the bucket.

01:52:03.900 --> 01:52:04.900
Put your body down the chute.

01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:06.900
Days.

01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:07.900
Oh, shit, this is the...

01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:08.900
Okay, the bridge.

01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:09.900
Okay.

01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:10.900
All right, start it over.

01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:11.900
All right.

01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:12.900
All right.

01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:13.900
All right.

01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:14.900
Wipe your head.

01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:15.900
Wipe your head.

01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:22.900
These are the song lyrics to my song.

01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:27.900
Doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop.

01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:29.900
A song has lyrics.

01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:30.900
They go like this.

01:52:30.900 --> 01:52:32.900
Chip, chip, chop, chop.

01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:33.900
Chip, chip, chip, chip, chip.

01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:34.900
Chip, chip, chip, chip.

01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:39.900
Everybody wants a song to be better than it is.

01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:43.900
But you never know which one you'll get.

01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:47.900
Everybody needs a song to be good.

01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:51.900
But you might as well go eat a brick or a piece of wood.

01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:54.900
Everybody needs music to be good.

01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:59.900
But if you're listening, who's making music good?

01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:00.900
Take those earbuds out.

01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:08.900
Grab a microphone because the people making music are untalented and alone.

01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:09.900
Chip, chip, chip, chip, chip.

01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:11.900
Thank you for coming to Harvard Town, everybody.

01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:12.900
That's there for John.

01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:13.900
I...

01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:14.900
I just didn't have to...

01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:16.900
Chip, chip, chip, chip, chip.

01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:17.900
Savannah.

01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:19.900
Chipa-chop, chip, chip, chip.

01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:21.900
Luke for bringing me poorly special,

01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:23.900
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:25.900
Chop. Chop. Chop.

01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:27.900
You're Mayor of Den Orenman.

01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:30.900
Chop chop, chop. Chop chop.

01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:32.900
Chop chop, chop. Chop chop.

01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:34.900
Women get tested, women get tested,

01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:37.900
Check yourself and get tested for at rest cancer.

01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:40.900
This song just became unhatable.

01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:45.900
Number one killer of women.

01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:48.900
If you hate this song you hate women.

01:53:48.900 --> 01:53:52.500
Men need to check themselves as well

01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:54.900
Now this song just doubled, leveled up

01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:56.900
Now you hate people if you hate this song

01:53:56.900 --> 01:53:59.900
Check your balls, check your movies

01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:02.900
Cancer's gonna kill you

01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:05.900
If you don't like this song

01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:10.900
AIDS

01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:21.900
AIDS

01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:25.900
Acquired immune, deficiency, syndrome in the room

01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:27.900
my name is Acquired Jones

01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:29.900
I don't be here all alone

01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:31.900
Gonna infect your whiteblood cells

01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:33.900
until they can't tell them themselves

01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:35.900
They're gonna attack more cells in turn

01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:36.900
Turn your whole body in

01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:40.900
Turn your whole body and make it burn health instead of life. Then you're gonna

01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:42.780
just to make it burn

01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:44.780
Die, it's not funny

01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:48.340
The show is over like five minutes a year

01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:55.340
Drone strikes

01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:58.340
Drone strikes, you're allowed to leave

01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:01.900
Don't do a drone strike on Katrina

01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:04.860
Katrina's in

01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:07.660
I'm only stating this because my iPad is clogged in

01:55:10.700 --> 01:55:17.100
Drone strikes Katrina, hi. Check your rest cancer all night. Check your balls too. Catch it numbs for once

01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:20.520
Gonna kill you when the fight was done. Ain't I quiet

01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:28.900
Did you get any of that?

01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:30.900
It's a good show!
