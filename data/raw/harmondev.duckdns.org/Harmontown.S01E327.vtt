His name is Dan Harmon.

01:09.480 --> 01:14.920
the mic in a microphone when I'm on the mic I'm never alone I got all of my

01:14.920 --> 01:21.440
friends coming at me my brownest poop in my yellow's pee

01:25.560 --> 01:37.400

01:37.400 --> 01:43.920
rumble rainforest extinction with grand distinction

01:43.920 --> 01:50.360
opened her legs what am I doing all right that was great I'll tell you what

01:50.360 --> 01:56.720
I'm doing okay I got the streets in my blood oh yeah we were just saying a

01:56.720 --> 02:00.640
dinner that you had the streets in your blood streets in my blood Cody thinks

02:00.640 --> 02:05.920
it's because I had a head injury but that yeah I fine I finally crossed a

02:05.920 --> 02:11.280
threshold I wrapped in my sleep I was freestyle rapping in my sleep and it's

02:11.280 --> 02:14.040
a it's an amazing Instagram video because it's just pitch black because Cody's

02:14.040 --> 02:17.400
just grabbing her camera and it's like in the beginning you can hear me like

02:17.400 --> 02:23.840
freestyle rapping gibberish because you and it's like it starts in the distance

02:23.840 --> 02:28.720
and then gets closer because she's like grabbing her her her phone right I'm

02:28.720 --> 02:37.120
really impressed with myself I think let me let me just I'm just gonna well

02:37.120 --> 02:40.600
because I think well there's there's contention about like whether or not it's

02:40.600 --> 02:44.400
because the streets are in my blood that's my theory right that I've been

02:44.400 --> 02:49.720
rapping so long that I'm now a real rapper and that's how we know I wrap in

02:49.720 --> 02:55.440
my sleep Cody thinks is because that day I got I got drunk and I came home and I

02:55.440 --> 02:59.440
was being like a fun dog dad and it was like wrestling with the dogs in the

02:59.440 --> 03:03.520
front yard like doing my impression of what I think like a man is supposed to

03:03.520 --> 03:07.680
be I guess like and and then after a while he's like you know he's just

03:07.680 --> 03:11.280
rolling in their shit you know like like and I was like yeah I was I rolled in

03:11.280 --> 03:15.640
their shit and and so I was covered in shit and then I went inside and it was

03:15.640 --> 03:20.680
very drunk and I took a shower and Jeff is just learning this information yeah

03:20.680 --> 03:27.400
and I fell in the shower wait you oh I'm sorry shit yeah you rolled physically

03:27.400 --> 03:31.560
in dog shit yeah in his yard on purpose like you're just not on purpose I was

03:31.560 --> 03:35.240
trying to play with the dogs and be cool like a like a like I was trying to be

03:35.240 --> 03:41.000
like a Chris Pratt type of like guy like come on come on buster come on oh you

03:41.000 --> 03:49.560

back of my head on the floor all of the shower and I was just kind of laying

04:14.840 --> 04:21.000
there and then I went to sleep and then I started rapping like in the shower

04:21.000 --> 04:27.040
unconscious I thought Cody had the present presence of mind to film this

04:27.040 --> 04:31.760
well when I started rapping she grabbed her she had she had she had strong

04:31.760 --> 04:38.280

it'll be getting out of the shower or stairs but like I have big feet and

06:41.040 --> 06:44.960
stairs are way too small when I was a kid I put like a sleeping bag over my

06:44.960 --> 06:48.480
head so I could like crawl around like a worm like nightcrawlers or whatever right

06:48.480 --> 06:53.160
and I I was crawling up the stairs and I slipped and fell backwards down the

06:53.160 --> 06:58.320
stairs in a sleeping bag and man I can remember the sound of my head hitting

06:58.320 --> 07:04.680
that tile it echoed in my head and then around the room you know it was bad and

07:04.680 --> 07:11.960
I've been depressed since I think that is when everything changed that's your

07:11.960 --> 07:16.160
origin story yeah yeah that's your spider-man spider bite yeah the next day

07:16.160 --> 07:26.680
I had a beard it was crazy and you had you had multi-sided dice that used to be

07:26.680 --> 07:31.840
just like a weird like a shitty Harvard stockbroker yeah like you were like a

07:31.840 --> 07:35.120
character from the boiler room yeah I just but late night so a play night

07:35.120 --> 07:41.440
crawl yeah I got I got jumped by a guy in San Diego maybe I told the story

07:41.440 --> 07:47.880
before on the show I got like attacked by a dude and my head hits the pavement

07:47.880 --> 07:53.160
and I'll never forget the sound of your head that sound a sidewalk it's a gross

07:53.160 --> 07:58.240
sound it sounds like dead yeah no it sounds like someone died but you know

07:58.240 --> 08:01.920
it's you making the sound in that moment there was another crisis going on there

08:01.920 --> 08:07.360
was still a guy attacking me but in my in my head I was like oh did I just are

08:07.360 --> 08:11.880
my brains oh like gonna fall out of my head yeah you don't you don't know what's

08:11.880 --> 08:15.400
happening other than some the worst thing it doesn't sound like a crack it's

08:15.400 --> 08:21.600
something a crack and like like a like a a fissure and an end a break yeah a

08:21.600 --> 08:26.720
break in life yeah that like this is it I died right pavement in San Diego that's

08:26.720 --> 08:30.800
how it sounded yeah that it's all it's sick I mean it really yeah it makes me

08:30.800 --> 08:38.160
sick I actually will bar from yeah I know because I had a cousin and I was

08:38.160 --> 08:42.080
like put in charge of him when I was like eight and he was like four or

08:42.080 --> 08:45.520
something and he was going through this phase where he would like throw tantrums

08:45.520 --> 08:50.160
and hit his head on stuff until people really wanted but I was eight so it was

08:50.160 --> 08:54.520
like can't don't kid a kidder like like but I was like don't get took them took

08:54.520 --> 08:59.360
them for a walk and we walk past a candy store and he was like candy candy I was

08:59.360 --> 09:05.920
like you can't I'm eight I could buy you any candy I'm fucking broke like you like

09:05.920 --> 09:09.960
you know like we're fucking kids together here I'm just bigger than you

09:09.960 --> 09:15.120
that's it like I ain't got no money like like and then and then he just like got

09:15.120 --> 09:18.720
down on the sidewalk and started hitting his head on it and I was just like what

09:18.720 --> 09:23.040
I was like okay how do you take how do you how do you parent and I was like my

09:23.040 --> 09:26.600
parents walk away whacking his head on the pavement oh yeah kids do that my

09:26.600 --> 09:29.360
little brother doing and I was I was like he's bluffing you got to call the bluff

09:29.360 --> 09:32.560
and I walked like a half a block and I look back and he was still going at it

09:32.560 --> 09:37.080
and like I did talk to him when he was like 20 and I was like are you all

09:37.080 --> 09:44.160
right he's a firefighter I mean we need those great I worked out but it's

09:44.160 --> 09:48.920
arguable that he wouldn't have chosen that job if I mean it's a dangerous job

09:48.920 --> 09:52.760
right maybe that's how firefighters get created wish they're like yeah they're

09:52.760 --> 09:56.760
like doing like there's something incredibly dangerous like it's the face

09:56.760 --> 10:01.640
pavement pounding of jobs yeah well I tell you're looking at it like that's

10:01.640 --> 10:06.240
just in his in his I'm saying like maybe he maybe he damaged the part of his

10:06.240 --> 10:10.520
brain that's like you got to get out of a burning building I think you're not

10:10.520 --> 10:14.440
supposed to go in we do need people to go in to put the fires out kid that does

10:14.440 --> 10:18.400
that and a person you're welcome and a person that a person that chooses that

10:18.400 --> 10:24.340
job as a person that's okay with eternity like he made his piece that day

10:24.340 --> 10:29.920
on the outside the candy store yeah he's like death means nothing to me if I

10:29.920 --> 10:33.240
had coddled him he would have grown up to be like what a candy thief or something

10:33.240 --> 10:39.480
or a candy store owner maybe I am a candy thief yeah you are yeah I was

10:39.480 --> 10:45.240
fucking doing a play in Whittier and me and Morgan Muchnick we're a freshman in

10:45.240 --> 10:50.200
high school and we're waiting for Morgan Muchnick was his name it probably

10:50.200 --> 10:55.000
still is and we were we're hanging out waiting for his mom to pick us up and

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
drive us back home to South Whittier and we leaned against the door of the

11:00.000 --> 11:06.840
liquor store and it opened so we fell into an open empty closed liquor store

11:06.840 --> 11:13.080
and we stole all the candy yeah we had little like sports like like dance bags

11:13.080 --> 11:18.600
like for our leg warmers or whatever we fucking had I don't know and we it was

11:18.600 --> 11:24.360
leg warmers and we just took all the starburst all the skittles all the damn

11:24.360 --> 11:31.600
and all the and we look we I think we thought still a couple of nudie mags like

11:31.600 --> 11:36.320
like tip mags we've got a couple of those and I said the cash registers right

11:36.320 --> 11:40.640
here and Morgan Muchnick wisely said I don't think we should do that too real

11:40.640 --> 11:45.880
yeah that's that that puts it over the edge yeah grand larceny yeah we're 15

11:45.880 --> 11:51.520
years old but still that puts it into like a like burglary yeah so we saw

11:51.520 --> 11:57.400
all the candy and we had a duffel bags filled with candy and for the next three

11:57.400 --> 12:03.120
weeks at high school we were hot shit that's gonna cheer leaders like hey who

12:03.120 --> 12:08.320
was some starburst up in the we were drug dealers and we had something's like

12:08.320 --> 12:12.080
how do you have all those candy or and we just pretend like we were rich yeah

12:12.080 --> 12:18.840
wow all right I we were just larceny I mean another I made another composition

12:18.840 --> 12:23.960
oh whoa I'm excited about this they're all starting to sound the same kind of

12:23.960 --> 12:28.680
but you're finding your voice well maybe yeah well so did George Harrison it

12:28.680 --> 12:32.400

12:32.400 --> 12:58.320
for it that I can present after I hear it again but

12:58.320 --> 13:05.760
yeah wait no wait yeah wait sing a song to it he has temp lyrics I got I got I have

13:05.760 --> 13:11.040
to remember the hold on I thought okay yeah it's like a one four five kind of

13:11.040 --> 13:17.040
thing let's do it's a men's style creation around it no I was the worst it

13:17.040 --> 13:23.000
was good I liked it I had a fun time I feel like I'm gonna forget it like wall

13:23.000 --> 13:27.680
um I thought I like why wouldn't okay you're getting stage fright well I'm just

13:27.680 --> 13:32.000
I feel like I'm gonna forget the lyrics while I'm maybe I what you know what I

13:32.000 --> 13:36.480
can do don't don't think about the lyrics just just be be there but you got to

13:36.480 --> 13:41.000
understand their temporary lyrics okay right like you know like I don't want

13:41.000 --> 13:46.800
any guff about like oh those lyrics aren't they don't sound very refined

13:46.800 --> 13:51.960
where's the so you guys know but like Dan he writes temp lyrics or he writes

13:51.960 --> 13:55.960
temp dialogue and then he comes back later and actually like rewrites it good

13:55.960 --> 14:00.600
just to get it so that's part of the process is is temping stuff it's

14:00.600 --> 14:04.240
important let me make sure this will play in the background no it won't wait

14:04.240 --> 14:10.080

14:10.080 --> 14:13.760
play they could have it play in the background that's probably only the iPad

14:13.760 --> 14:18.240

the desert they're still chilled and and still people yeah they're in my

15:38.720 --> 15:44.600
opinion I think they're the Goldilocks of true crime podcasting it doesn't have

15:44.600 --> 15:49.000
to be your opinion I just think that it's been years since we had the my

15:49.000 --> 15:53.640
favorite murder girls on and those years for me have been filled with just

15:53.640 --> 15:58.640
endless true crime listening and Cody and I and Tahiti we kind of like hit this

15:58.640 --> 16:03.920
point where we had run out of of true crime podcast like the four or five that

16:03.920 --> 16:07.400
we were listening to kind of binging they all ran out at the same time and we

16:07.400 --> 16:10.960
so we listened to like probably what felt like hundreds and hundreds of

16:10.960 --> 16:16.280
different people and just judging and sneering and bullying their speech

16:16.280 --> 16:19.960
impediments and whatever you know just like bonding over that selection

16:19.960 --> 16:26.160
process and then we just found this this these two British ladies and and I'm

16:26.160 --> 16:31.200
just so thrilled that they turned out to be willing to to come out here and talk

16:31.200 --> 16:35.480

17:11.840 --> 17:17.480
Saruti laid down some fucking TLC obviously yeah had to be done song that

17:17.480 --> 17:24.480
needs to be sung and no scrubs yeah no scrubs she has you have a hard line

17:24.480 --> 17:30.280
against scrubs yeah no scrubs no scrubs and then you did Peggy Lee Hannah I did

17:30.280 --> 17:35.640
yeah I love Peggy she's a big huge fan and they were quite a nice easy one for

17:35.640 --> 17:42.000
karaoke I think it's pretty pretty level yeah it was very good thank you and you

17:42.000 --> 17:46.280
guys hiked up to the Hollywood sign today huge mistake yeah we hiked up to

17:46.280 --> 17:52.000
the summit of Mount Hollywood by accident it really was pretty bad yeah

17:52.000 --> 17:55.480
and there's one true crime story associated with the Hollywood sign pig

17:55.480 --> 17:59.440
and whistle hurled herself off of one of the letters when it was still Hollywood

17:59.440 --> 18:05.560
land right yeah I was kind of like looking at Jeff I thought Jeff for some

18:05.560 --> 18:10.920
reason I know who is that what's her what's the person actor 19 it was like

18:10.920 --> 18:15.520
1930 something she jumped off the I don't know did she stand on the top of the

18:15.520 --> 18:18.040
actual letters if she didn't it doesn't really count as jumping off the

18:18.040 --> 18:22.520
Hollywood yeah it doesn't but yeah I used to walk up there back in the day

18:22.520 --> 18:29.800
where before like there was a motion sensor like security and you could hike

18:29.800 --> 18:34.240
up there and you could just hang out and have a drink under the last o on

18:34.240 --> 18:39.000
Hollywood it was very good and now if you go up there you just get killed oh

18:39.000 --> 18:43.480
yeah we saw a coyote like a real one huh yeah I've never seen one before in my

18:43.480 --> 18:50.600
daily aggressive fire displaced coyotes they're so jungle girls they're so bold

18:50.600 --> 18:55.040
now I keep seeing them this last year I swear to God when you drive your car

18:55.040 --> 18:59.200
by or something or you come out by your car like they'll come up to people like

18:59.200 --> 19:04.200
like a domesticated dog like happy to see people and it's like this is this is

19:04.200 --> 19:08.480
gonna be bad because like they're gonna get hit by cars or they're gonna eat

19:08.480 --> 19:12.760
everyone's dogs or something but if you yell at a coyote they'll go away but

19:12.760 --> 19:18.320
what they're gonna do is eat your neighbor's cat right I'm for real like

19:18.320 --> 19:23.200
like you'll like if you live in Las Feliz or like near the park you'll just

19:23.200 --> 19:27.920
hear the sound of there's a family of them I story right in that like there's a

19:27.920 --> 19:31.600
bramble of things right on the other side of that wall in my backyard that's a

19:31.600 --> 19:36.040
fucking I actually need to talk to you about this because a you're on the payroll

19:36.040 --> 19:43.200
this falls to you really yeah and be you're famous on this podcast for having

19:43.200 --> 19:50.760
like prepped a coyote fighting method oh yeah I've been out there come at me I do

19:50.760 --> 19:55.480
yell stuff at him now I like open my window and go go like like yeah fuck

19:55.480 --> 20:01.920
you I like I go fuck it off like I just like yell at him so Rudy and Hannah did

20:01.920 --> 20:06.320
you see wildlife today we saw we saw the one coyote but as soon as we took our

20:06.320 --> 20:10.720
phones out that was enough it ran away and we saw some signs about rattlesnakes

20:10.720 --> 20:14.080
but no actual rattlesnakes yeah which is good because she had sandals on it's

20:14.080 --> 20:17.800
called to their hybrid inning right now but they're there they love it there's

20:17.800 --> 20:24.280
that's true yeah yeah what's the most dangerous non-human life form in London

20:24.280 --> 20:39.680
Theresa May is there like like like like here I would say like within Los

20:39.680 --> 20:43.840
Angeles city limits like the brown recluse or something like that like a

20:43.840 --> 20:48.560
spider that if it bites you you could like necrotize and lose your foot do

20:48.560 --> 20:52.560
you have anything in London that's like a creepy crawly that could like kill you

20:52.560 --> 20:59.720
hurt you hospitalize you badges they're not badgers yeah TB they've got TB and

20:59.720 --> 21:04.080
they don't stop fighting you until they hear your bones crack oh they've got TB

21:04.080 --> 21:11.400
you have badgers that Rome London yeah we've got badgers foxes the foxes are a

21:11.400 --> 21:15.240
bit more like I've seen the foxes of them walking on the road and fucking

21:15.240 --> 21:19.080
short it yeah there's a fucking fox that takes balls to be a fox and walk

21:19.080 --> 21:22.760
through London oh yeah that's like where they I mean like that's where they

21:22.760 --> 21:29.280
invented like the the fox hunt yeah well it's illegal now yeah yeah but I mean

21:29.280 --> 21:32.640
still the foxes don't know that I mean there it is like it must be in their

21:32.640 --> 21:37.640
DNA that you're not supposed to go near like Buckingham Palace the case the

21:37.640 --> 21:43.440
Queen rides out on your steed there's probably what do they call what kind of

21:43.440 --> 21:49.640
horn do fox hunters blow bugle yeah bugle is it a bugle or they were the

21:49.640 --> 21:52.920
really long one I'm not sure if I know what the name is a flugel horn flugel

21:52.920 --> 22:01.680
horn flugel horn moving on moving on to true crime okay but yeah well so I did

22:01.680 --> 22:06.680
to ask the reddit the subreddit you know do you guys have anything you'd want to

22:06.680 --> 22:12.960
know from these ladies I would say like a large share of the questions circle

22:12.960 --> 22:19.720
around the theme of is it traumatizing toxifying anxiety inducing is it fucking

22:19.720 --> 22:23.880
you up in any way to be constantly thinking about people getting murdered

22:23.880 --> 22:27.640
and researching it and all that stuff and I I mean do you want to speak to that

22:27.640 --> 22:33.040
first I don't think we know yet what the damage is being done we'll find out in

22:33.040 --> 22:37.920
like maybe five years it's like Wi-Fi is probably giving us herpes or something

22:37.920 --> 22:43.520
exactly wow it's just like lying dormant right now damage we're doing what was

22:43.520 --> 22:47.640
the the impetus like what brought you into that into the world of true crime

22:47.640 --> 22:52.040
podcasting so we met at a party at Hannah's house we didn't know each other

22:52.040 --> 22:56.240
two years ago and kind of like what you and Cody were doing down we would just

22:56.240 --> 23:01.440
listen to other true crime podcast and we were like that's alright and then when

23:01.440 --> 23:05.520
we met we were like we could do this we should we should start a restaurant we

23:05.520 --> 23:09.960
should start a podcast cupcake business exactly and then I left that party

23:09.960 --> 23:16.320
thinking I'll never see that guy but what's the allure for because I think

23:16.320 --> 23:23.360
it's a lot of women listen to of true crime podcast is it because well what

23:23.360 --> 23:28.880
is the alert with a prey aren't we so often and I think it's quite good to I

23:28.880 --> 23:32.520
don't know I think it's just we're just morbidly fascinated somebody left us a

23:32.520 --> 23:37.080
really negative review saying it's like you're morbidly fascinated yeah we are

23:37.080 --> 23:40.920
there is kind of like you know there was there was that throughout the the reddit

23:40.920 --> 23:46.760
thread like there were people who delved into that question of like you know

23:46.760 --> 23:50.600
wanting to know about the gulery of it all if that's a word but and there was

23:50.600 --> 23:54.440
one there was one post in particular it was like all the way like crazy how are

23:54.440 --> 23:58.920
you simultaneously like a Tyler Durden the edge lord and anti true crime like

23:58.920 --> 24:05.600
where they were like like ask them how they can stomach being the perpetuators

24:05.600 --> 24:08.920
of blood whatever it was like it was like somebody that was like really just

24:08.920 --> 24:16.040
wanted to shame the genre and I don't I don't think it's a righteous genre at

24:16.040 --> 24:20.400
all I told you guys when we had dinner the other night like like among the many

24:20.400 --> 24:25.640
like almost innumerable variables that that I like go to with in my head as a

24:25.640 --> 24:28.640
true crime listener you guys are just sort of at the sweet spot of all of them

24:28.640 --> 24:35.600
and that especially includes this spectrum between the kind of the gulery

24:35.600 --> 24:42.040
like where you're just like actually like into how bad things happen to good

24:42.040 --> 24:46.360
people and you're kind of like on the bad things side and then the other end of

24:46.360 --> 24:50.800
the spectrum is this this compulsion that a lot of true crime podcasts have

24:50.800 --> 24:54.200
especially lately where it's like they you can tell they kind of feel bad about

24:54.200 --> 24:57.320
what they're doing to the point where they they're now kind of contorting their

24:57.320 --> 25:01.200
language to make it seem like they're a public service like this is about

25:01.200 --> 25:05.200
remembering the victims and a stuff I'm like yeah that's not a bad thing or

25:05.200 --> 25:09.840
anything but like really do we do we is it would it be so bad if we were just we

25:09.840 --> 25:14.480
were just fascinated with horrible things like in this like unhealthy way

25:14.480 --> 25:18.560
that we were kind of fixated on it is that really such a bad thing and do you

25:18.560 --> 25:23.520
guys ever have conversations about that with yourselves about like what are we

25:23.520 --> 25:29.440
is this a healthy thing we're doing is this is this unhealthy in a good way is

25:29.440 --> 25:33.680
it healthy in a bad way like what like where do you put yourselves in relation

25:33.680 --> 25:39.680
to the the the karma of it all I think that and for me personally I'm just

25:39.680 --> 25:43.760
fascinated with people and I think that's why true crime is so popular

25:43.760 --> 25:49.360
because I'm always quite wary of people who describe killers as monsters I

25:49.360 --> 25:52.400
think that's quite dangerous language because you're separating them from

25:52.400 --> 25:57.000
yourself but actually you're just as capable as of doing that as that you

25:57.000 --> 26:01.440
have all of the same stuff that they do really it's just a separate version of

26:01.440 --> 26:04.240
events that have led them to that point and that's what I think is interesting

26:04.240 --> 26:12.680
yeah but I know what you mean I think like it's important to not victim blame

26:12.680 --> 26:16.440
and give like name the victims and stuff because I think it's quite easy to just

26:16.440 --> 26:20.240
like reel off a list of like a body count and not identify them as people

26:20.240 --> 26:24.520
yeah for my money I just draw though I don't what I don't like to hear and I've

26:24.520 --> 26:28.640
never ever since I was binge watching forensic files before there were true

26:28.640 --> 26:34.640
crime podcasts I I know I always hated it when the implication which was an

26:34.640 --> 26:38.160
implication that is kind of the bread and butter of those old-school true crime

26:38.160 --> 26:43.120
television shows the implication that you kind of deserve bad things to happen

26:43.120 --> 26:47.800
to you if you leave your television set if you go out into the world like like

26:47.800 --> 26:51.760
wrong place wrong time I've ranted about that like just that that underlying

26:51.760 --> 26:56.400
religion of like well you shouldn't have gotten to that trucker's cab like I don't

26:56.400 --> 27:01.200
care how like risky the behavior is like no one yeah I just personally for lazy

27:01.200 --> 27:05.200
selfish reasons I don't want to live in a world where anyone ever deserves

27:05.200 --> 27:09.000
anything bad to happen to them because I feel like it's bad shit's gonna happen

27:09.000 --> 27:13.120
to me and people are gonna I just I'm not like the brightest bulb in the drawer

27:13.120 --> 27:19.360
when it comes to like minimizing risk so I like I just it's okay to say that was

27:19.360 --> 27:23.520
probably gonna happen because you engage in that high-risk behavior but but to

27:23.520 --> 27:28.960
there's some kind of line there where like shows will imply almost that what

27:28.960 --> 27:33.520
did you expect and you guys don't do that but at the same time you're very much

27:33.520 --> 27:38.480
not you're very funny and profane and almost like so I mean you're you're

27:38.480 --> 27:45.000
you're you you make jokes about the the the the victims behavior and one thing

27:45.000 --> 27:48.880
that comes to mind like the the girl who disappeared from the cruise ship that

27:48.880 --> 27:55.640
episode and you guys just sort of like you're making like jokes about like like

27:55.640 --> 27:59.680
who are these people and like the kinds of reactions they're having to their to

27:59.680 --> 28:05.160
their their family member going missing and I remember just being like like this

28:05.160 --> 28:09.360
skirts the line perfectly for me this is my taste exactly because you weren't

28:09.360 --> 28:12.400
like their pieces of shit for having a bad thing happened to them you're just

28:12.400 --> 28:16.800
sort of questioning their their their judgment in the aftermath like what how

28:16.800 --> 28:19.680
the cruise ship is handling it how they're handling it all that stuff like

28:19.680 --> 28:26.480
it Dan do you have a question no I have a point to that though because I would

28:26.480 --> 28:30.640
say that the reason I mean instinctively we wouldn't be the kind of people that

28:30.640 --> 28:34.600
would victim blame it just feels grubby and it feels wrong but also we're

28:34.600 --> 28:37.280
definitely well I'm definitely the kind of person that constantly puts myself in

28:37.280 --> 28:44.740
situations in which I should probably end up being murdered I do enjoy

28:44.740 --> 28:55.560
hitchhiking I've done it several times you like your crime because you're going

28:55.560 --> 29:02.840
to be a topic at some point immerse yourself in the day I get murdered will

29:02.840 --> 29:13.960
be your best episode it you really hitchhike still I have hitchhiked like

29:13.960 --> 29:18.360
like thumb on the road like standing on the road and not thumb that's a bit old

29:18.360 --> 29:23.880
school it's bit cliche it's Venmo now exactly how do you how do you moderate

29:23.880 --> 29:26.800
hitchhike was not you stand there and then you wait until somebody comes up in

29:26.800 --> 29:34.680
a car and I would say every time that I have hitchhiked I have absolutely

29:34.680 --> 29:40.840
had to do it there's been no categorically false this is a runner at

29:40.840 --> 29:45.680
the show so Rudy refuses to stop I picked up I picked up I've picked up a

29:45.680 --> 29:48.800
couple hitchhikers in my life and where I was certain I was going to be murdered

29:48.800 --> 29:55.080
by the hitchhiker I got a hitchhiker one time and the guy left my car and he

29:55.080 --> 29:58.760
got out of the car and he said thank you and he said to me words I'll never

29:58.760 --> 30:08.200
forget he said don't take any wooden pussy I don't know what it means but I

30:08.200 --> 30:17.640
have lived by that law since 1994 I've never taken any wooden pussy I will say

30:17.640 --> 30:22.200
there is a disturbing like undercurrent of like oh I'm preparing for the day

30:22.200 --> 30:25.560
that like this is gonna happen to me like we're women we're the prey because

30:25.560 --> 30:32.200
like when I went Cody like we're early on in our relationship I think I've like

30:32.200 --> 30:36.080
like bullied her out of like expressing it or something because you can see how

30:36.080 --> 30:42.400
much it upsets me like but that the the that that concept of like I'm I'm

30:42.400 --> 30:47.440
prepared for the day I encounter one of these like monsters like like I'm good

30:47.440 --> 30:51.360
like Cody saying like I like and she's confiding in me so nobody judge her

30:51.360 --> 30:55.800
this is her talking to her fiance that and not knowing he's gonna like podcast it

30:55.800 --> 31:00.920
but like like confiding a feeling like when we're talking about what we get

31:00.920 --> 31:04.960
out of this genre like Cody confiding was feeling that like one of these days

31:04.960 --> 31:08.920
one of these situations is gonna happen to me and I'm gonna nail it you know and

31:08.920 --> 31:13.320
I honestly like I mean it makes me angry because I I'm like stop it stop

31:13.320 --> 31:18.840
saying that like just like be terrified all the time like don't don't get cocky

31:18.840 --> 31:24.120
like I can't like it's the worst feeling in the world is that the thing for

31:24.120 --> 31:30.680
women let that love true crime podcast or in your love of it because like well

31:30.680 --> 31:36.320
if I walk into an elevator and a guy gets in the elevator with me I'm not I'm

31:36.320 --> 31:41.160
not afraid right if I walk through a parking garage like a garage like a

31:41.160 --> 31:45.720
parking lot and if I hear footsteps behind me I don't think I'm going to get

31:45.720 --> 31:49.960
raped or murdered but I think that's kind of the neutral setting for all

31:49.960 --> 31:55.280
women right oh yeah it's like a perpetual state of danger right on your

31:55.280 --> 31:59.600
toes so you is that part of why you do what you do and what why that's a

31:59.600 --> 32:03.200
fascination of the murder thing because murder is always an option every time

32:03.200 --> 32:11.000
you walk out the door no no for women get killed all the time by their

32:11.000 --> 32:15.840
boyfriends when they go jogging yeah it's definitely true but then I think like yeah

32:15.840 --> 32:19.560
I don't know if that is the impetus I feel like all women probably feel that

32:19.560 --> 32:23.080
way so they'd all be running true crime podcast though you know sometimes it

32:23.080 --> 32:28.200
does feel like everyone is but I think it's more just I've just always been

32:28.200 --> 32:32.480
interested in it I'm just the kind of person I like like to go look for what

32:32.480 --> 32:36.720
is the most disturbing film the most disturbing book like Dan Carlin from

32:36.720 --> 32:40.720
hardcore history kind of comes back to the idea that people are fascinated by

32:40.720 --> 32:45.160
the extremes of the human experiences I think the word he uses it's like that's

32:45.160 --> 32:49.600
why what war is it's like what drives a society to like throw people at other

32:49.600 --> 32:53.520
people until like one of them explodes or something you know and so it's like

32:53.520 --> 32:57.200
that is like it's so far afield from our normal lives that's it's somehow

32:57.200 --> 33:01.080
fascinating like you said it's like we all have the same DNA and stuff so it's

33:01.080 --> 33:05.880
like what what separates us from these people that live this extreme version and

33:05.880 --> 33:10.320
and that is fascinating maybe I think so and I think it's always we get feedback

33:10.320 --> 33:15.120
from people saying oh that episode was too gory or too violent but they are

33:15.120 --> 33:19.640
categorically our best-performing episodes and some people like I will

33:19.640 --> 33:23.160
swear on the show like not because we're trying to offend anyone it's just how

33:23.160 --> 33:27.960
I just how fucking talk right so I think so people will say I just can't I can't

33:27.960 --> 33:31.240
stand this swearing but I was okay but like listening to a description of a

33:31.240 --> 33:35.160
body being cut up you're fine with right it is weird to be what people's

33:35.160 --> 33:42.280
dealbreakers turn out to be yeah I think it you guys have such like grace and

33:42.280 --> 33:46.440
poise and maybe that's like maybe 40% of that is just Americans think all

33:46.440 --> 33:50.240
British people have grace and poise but like I'll take it but but I mean it's a

33:50.240 --> 33:55.760
it's an audio format so the accents are like a huge part of what's for sale I

33:55.760 --> 34:01.520
like listening to these voices and but you guys have this sort of confidence to

34:01.520 --> 34:05.600
you even though you're dealing with these are really like gray areas especially

34:05.600 --> 34:09.280
in this time when I feel like I'll just speak for myself like I feel I can't I

34:09.280 --> 34:14.200
feel like every time I open my mouth I'm just in a minefield and all I can do is

34:14.200 --> 34:20.360
just fuck up like as little as possible but so it's kind of nice listening to

34:20.360 --> 34:28.640
you guys like you're you're you're you're smart and and and like you're here

34:28.640 --> 34:32.800
when when when the conversation sometimes goes into these areas of like

34:32.800 --> 34:38.040
about society about like culture things that could be construed as possibly

34:38.040 --> 34:42.240
politics although I think it's a shame that that these things are called

34:42.240 --> 34:46.600
politics these days things like the incel when we did when you did the Elliot

34:46.600 --> 34:51.120
Roger thing I just it was such a beautifully concise like I think it was

34:51.120 --> 34:55.840
you Saruti like kind of like ran down just really quickly like what what is an

34:55.840 --> 35:02.200
incel what is the deal with this and like like it was so it made me feel more

35:02.200 --> 35:10.120
in control of a of this quagmire just listening to you guys like as eyes in

35:10.120 --> 35:13.660
like like talking about it I don't I again I have no questions I'm a bad

35:13.660 --> 35:17.760
interview but but but the Reddit people have have have questions I the some of

35:17.760 --> 35:22.200
which actually tickled me oh I but thank you also here's a huge service you

35:22.200 --> 35:29.880
provide I urge this is a call to action like everyone has to stop endorsing the

35:29.880 --> 35:33.560
lie detector like I love that every time there's a lie detector involved in an

35:33.560 --> 35:38.080
investigation guys specifically stop and make a point of how lie detectors are

35:38.080 --> 35:41.600
horseshit and that no one should ever consent to a lie detector test like

35:41.600 --> 35:45.800
whether you're guilty innocent whatever the larger crime is lie detectors being

35:45.800 --> 35:50.000
taken seriously everyone just refused them because they're just like the

35:50.000 --> 35:55.160
beat does not that would get a bigger applause that was a weird applause break

35:55.160 --> 36:00.480
there I mean I really like it's my it's my big I guess that that in the 911 call

36:00.480 --> 36:04.160
I guess I do have this like hang up about like what's the 911 call well just

36:04.160 --> 36:08.120
that idea of like everyone gets judged for their 911 oh how crazy they sound

36:08.120 --> 36:12.840
you know she sounds weird she sounds so robotic she's like a mannequin like she

36:12.840 --> 36:17.840
must be guilty like I just live in terror of is like I'm gonna something's gonna

36:17.840 --> 36:21.440
happen to Cody and I'm gonna like call 911 and people are gonna listen forever

36:21.440 --> 36:26.920
to my 911 call he was so calm yeah I have a feeling that it would hold I do

36:26.920 --> 36:30.600
think that if something happened to one of you guys I might know where the Dan

36:30.600 --> 36:38.280
during his 911 call about Cody he just kept talking about Chevy Chase why why

36:38.280 --> 36:43.080
would he do that I don't like I don't like that because just like like because

36:43.080 --> 36:46.880
you could say you could justify any narrative and it would make sense because

36:46.880 --> 36:50.400
people are fucking crazy and do all sorts of crazy shit so like I don't know

36:50.400 --> 36:53.280
is it Amanda Knox or whatever she did like flips or whatever and they're like

36:53.280 --> 36:55.640
that's what she do she was innocent it's like that's what you do is we're

36:55.640 --> 36:59.200
guilty it's like yeah both of those are true what I mean what we're just that's

36:59.200 --> 37:03.240
an idea you had okay that doesn't mean anything yeah dingo baby lady yeah

37:03.240 --> 37:11.520
exactly dingo baby crying the dark was it no so this lady and her baby got

37:11.520 --> 37:17.680
eaten by a dingo is it crying the dark was the phone call maybe yeah and no one

37:17.680 --> 37:20.280
believed her because she was too sort of stoic yeah and he just kept talking

37:20.280 --> 37:28.280
about how dingo's eat me and it was like a dingo my baby yeah exactly and then

37:28.280 --> 37:32.400
she went to prison and then they found the baby skeleton in a dingo's nest so

37:32.400 --> 37:37.760
yeah that's the thing is just because people are just putting weird

37:37.760 --> 37:41.200
narratives from their own baggage on someone going through Christ I mean

37:41.200 --> 37:44.760
that's why Dan probably feels uncomfortable yeah judgment yeah exactly

37:44.760 --> 37:48.280
it's particularly judgment about like how you're weird how you talk weird how

37:48.280 --> 37:51.880
you act weird let's do it let's do it that someone did suggest to this is in

37:51.880 --> 37:57.120
the reddit they said do a 9-1-1 role play exercise and I'm not sure how to do

37:57.120 --> 38:01.040
it but because the two things are like if you're on night the two things you

38:01.040 --> 38:04.960
hear on every 9-1-1 caller if the person is like

38:04.960 --> 38:09.880
neurotypical in their reaction like in other words they're like screaming

38:09.880 --> 38:13.120
they're in hysterics oh my god this horrible thing is happening what is

38:13.120 --> 38:16.680
the what is the thing that the 9-1-1 operator immediately says I need to

38:16.680 --> 38:21.800
calm down yeah ma'am I calm down I need a couple like like it's so like it's so

38:21.800 --> 38:29.120
predictable and I why does she need to calm down she's screaming here's my

38:29.120 --> 38:34.400
address there's a headless body in my driveway it's okay for her to not be

38:34.400 --> 38:38.880
calm she's giving you every piece of interest it's also okay for her to be way

38:38.880 --> 38:44.520
too calm because there's a shock factor yeah but then when she does that then

38:44.520 --> 38:51.200
she's a suspect like it God forbid that they all right so how do we do yeah I

38:51.200 --> 38:55.160
don't know what to what I don't know who's gonna be 9-1-1 Jeff someone should

38:55.160 --> 38:59.640
be 9-1-1 and then someone else I think we just go okay let's do it this way

38:59.640 --> 39:04.360
hmm because it's like why don't we make it like the game of werewolf where we

39:04.360 --> 39:09.840
secretly pick one of us is is is a murderer okay and then we'll do a

39:09.840 --> 39:17.280
series of 9-1-1 calls and and and and you guys will determine which of us is

39:17.280 --> 39:22.120
that sounds great let's do that I think I think Spencer should be the the

39:22.120 --> 39:29.400
dispatch like the 9-1-1 person okay okay so like like so how do we yeah that's

39:29.400 --> 39:34.720
what I don't we got to figure that part out okay what did Dave find my personal

39:34.720 --> 39:41.120
plan can you come up here for a moment everybody my personal trainer Dave

39:41.120 --> 39:48.840
Klein nimble is a mountain goat I ran into him at the drawing room and he

39:48.840 --> 39:58.040
became my trainer that's all day okay so Dave what I'm gonna ask you to do is

39:58.040 --> 40:03.000
just we're gonna close our eyes and then you're gonna tap one of us on the

40:03.000 --> 40:08.480
head and that person will be the murderer so so all four of the me Hannah

40:08.480 --> 40:13.400
Surici and I we all close our eyes yeah because I don't know how to exclude one

40:13.400 --> 40:19.480
of you I don't have the heart to do that we're closing our eyes so we don't know

40:19.480 --> 40:24.280
who Dave Kline is picking as the murderer no crimes now Dave Kline's gonna

40:24.280 --> 40:30.960
gonna gonna touch them or somehow indicate to them that they're I'm gonna walk

40:30.960 --> 40:35.520
around I'm gonna walk around everybody so you can't tell exactly right it's like

40:35.520 --> 40:40.960
heads up seven yeah all right yeah did people play that game did people play

40:40.960 --> 40:45.560
four corners does anyone remember four corners when I moved down here no one

40:45.560 --> 40:48.600
played four corners and then people started playing and then everyone was

40:48.600 --> 40:52.360
playing and I was like did I bring four corners down here and make sure you

40:52.360 --> 40:56.320
exclude Spencer because he's gonna be the dispatch I'm just closing my eyes to

40:56.320 --> 41:01.560
like sharing the group yeah that's that's good I might have invented four

41:01.560 --> 41:04.960
quarters down here though it was a northern California thing there's four

41:04.960 --> 41:10.360
square you got a murderer on your hands oh shit okay I'm opening my eyes okay so

41:10.360 --> 41:14.200
we're good we're good to go right now so how do how do we start this oh if you

41:14.200 --> 41:18.720
were poked just to be clear if you were poked on the right side of your rib

41:18.720 --> 41:28.920
cage you're the murderer right all right okay how do we like how do I think

41:28.920 --> 41:33.600
I who calls who wants to figure this out who wants to go first I think I could

41:33.600 --> 41:36.960
start us off if we know who's going first okay well should we get like a

41:36.960 --> 41:40.040
thumbnail of the murder though so that we're all doing the same so that are

41:40.040 --> 41:46.720
the same crime like we just need like like what like a cause of death your

41:46.720 --> 41:54.000
spouse is is decapitated on the kitchen floor okay it's there and you're

41:54.000 --> 42:00.480
calling 911 decapitated spouse so if you murdered them you decapitated them I

42:00.480 --> 42:07.240
think eventually the audience I guess I guess not you guys cuz maybe Dave

42:07.240 --> 42:18.360
Klein can guess because I didn't see well yeah I thought people would like me

42:18.360 --> 42:22.520
being smart thank you for helping us thanks for being nice to me I need it

42:22.520 --> 42:27.120
actually this is a collaborative effort we are making this up okay all right so

42:27.120 --> 42:34.840
yeah and the prospect here is that we're gonna try to do the murder is gonna

42:34.840 --> 42:39.360
try to sound like a murder doesn't make a lot of sense no it's like they're all

42:39.360 --> 42:43.640
gonna we're all gonna be lying because we don't have a it's a it doesn't make

42:43.640 --> 42:53.800
any sense no no it's good hold on hold on hold on let's say a police officer

42:53.800 --> 42:59.320
first we wait it's first I don't like this first week we all make a 9-11 call

42:59.320 --> 43:05.760
a 9-1-1 call yeah or in England isn't it just ollie ollie oxenfree or what

43:05.760 --> 43:12.520
999 999 999 yeah that's got a result in a lot more false but dials right like I

43:12.520 --> 43:16.640
think that's just a bunch of 9-1-1 it goes through to 999 because it's on TV

43:16.640 --> 43:21.160
so that's nice interesting so first first everybody has to make a call

43:21.160 --> 43:27.000
saying that a crime has been committed and they've seen a decapitated lady what

43:27.000 --> 43:32.080
don't you get and then then I think Spencer after after you have been

43:32.080 --> 43:36.120
dispatched here I think you are the lead detective in the like the first 48

43:36.120 --> 43:41.840
kind of course I mean of course yeah so it's everybody gets sat down and you

43:41.840 --> 43:46.560
have to make your first yeah we all get it yeah yeah what don't you get no no

43:46.560 --> 43:52.840
the key to this game is you Hannah your your your background is in theater right

43:52.840 --> 43:59.920
yeah yeah yeah Saruti you're you working like PR or like events like we're all

43:59.920 --> 44:05.000
entertainers here so with those of us who aren't the murderers we just need to

44:05.000 --> 44:09.040
be so fucking good and in the moment are you saying that you're not the murder

44:09.040 --> 44:14.000
because you're the murderer whoa we need to be so in the moment we really do

44:14.000 --> 44:18.960
believe that we found a body guys talking like a murderer right now

44:18.960 --> 44:26.000

go into our first meeting with like the lead detective oh this is see this is

52:25.680 --> 52:31.560
Jeff's idea okay yeah all right look I'm I'm not gonna slow down I'm sure you've

52:31.560 --> 52:39.480
wondering why I've asked you all here are we all to a dinner mystery about the

52:39.480 --> 52:44.040
crime in which you're all implicated were we all married to the same identical

52:44.040 --> 52:50.040
murders to four identical doppelgangers it's all the same murder it's all it

52:50.040 --> 52:56.480
was it's all the same and it's all the same murder it seems this event

52:56.480 --> 53:03.320
converged multiple universes and I'm here to find out why now why was everyone

53:03.320 --> 53:13.080
not calm or too calm explain your logic I was just in a panic I I was terrified

53:13.080 --> 53:20.280
first for my wife and then for myself I ran out the door and the cops shot me

53:21.400 --> 53:31.640
wow I just I really can't do door handles hmm a likely story what about

53:31.640 --> 53:41.600
nobs nobs I can do but I have to do them with my elbows checks out and and

53:41.600 --> 53:47.320
sorority or whatever your character's name was if it was different talk it

53:47.320 --> 53:54.640
wasn't stiff stiff upper lip that's that's very suspicious I'm a

53:54.640 --> 54:01.200
professional and I know these things I'll move on well I got an elbow I was

54:01.200 --> 54:04.240
teaching yoga in Los Feliz baby I got 30 people that can tell you exactly what

54:04.240 --> 54:08.760
I was doing we can went through a whole sun salutation situation yeah I had what

54:08.760 --> 54:13.000
there was a lady let out a real loud juicy fart during Savasana everybody

54:13.000 --> 54:16.120
remembers it well this is kind of unrelated actually you're just here

54:16.120 --> 54:22.280
because you keep poking people in the side look I got real strict probation

54:22.280 --> 54:26.880
situation all right you gotta poke three people every month yeah something like

54:26.880 --> 54:32.880
that or it's back in the big time that's right checks out thanks Jeff what the

54:32.880 --> 54:38.240
fuck I I I don't understand why I'm here I'd like to have a lawyer present

54:38.240 --> 54:41.360
before I answer any question right actually though your friend just got

54:41.360 --> 54:45.960
killed by a ghost right we saw we caught a live on film yeah I I run a very

54:45.960 --> 54:51.160
successful pizza a likely story all right Spencer I'd like to lawyer I think

54:51.160 --> 54:54.600
it's the murder I'm gonna guess Jeff I think it's probably sorority but that

54:54.600 --> 55:00.520
seems too obvious well will the real murderer raise their hand well who's

55:00.520 --> 55:05.160
she asked the audience what they know well let's ask the audience okay

55:05.160 --> 55:10.040
everybody on the audience guess on three okay is that cool yeah okay one two

55:10.040 --> 55:20.720
three I heard Spencer I did feel they saw they saw you tap me yeah I was the

55:20.720 --> 55:25.360
murderer I really thought it was I just if I was ready I'm a master of game

55:25.360 --> 55:32.320
theory you guys know about the Monty Hall problem the Monty Hall what I don't

55:32.320 --> 55:36.480
know who's enjoying this but someone's gonna love this show here's a good here's

55:36.480 --> 55:42.960
a question I I rather liked from the subreddit little little British talk is

55:42.960 --> 55:47.280
that what you're laughing at because I said I rather liked isn't it just isn't

55:47.280 --> 55:51.760
it just you're just saying because I'm interrupting with continuing my bad

55:51.760 --> 55:58.520
interviewing it should be a brother all right come on my goal isn't to be

55:58.520 --> 56:05.760
British in it I like this question I rather liked this question didn't I

56:05.760 --> 56:11.240
just does anyone think that our generation being obsessed with true

56:11.240 --> 56:15.920
crime will create better serial killers it's like we're all doing research on how

56:15.920 --> 56:19.920
to get away with murder kind of a similar problem with antibiotics right

56:19.920 --> 56:28.600
we're gonna make a superbug and I'm not sure whether true crime is a new

56:28.600 --> 56:32.360
fascination like how how long is America's most want to be on television

56:32.360 --> 56:36.560
but don't you think it's safe to say that well I mean that's a dumb leading

56:36.560 --> 56:43.760
question I do do you do do we or do we not think that more people are kind of

56:43.760 --> 56:48.800
forensically savvy than let's say 20 years ago I think we know what luminol

56:48.800 --> 56:52.920
is we know so if you're so if you were gonna like fly into a rage and like

56:52.920 --> 56:57.240
murder somebody or kill him for insurance like it's safe to say that you are

56:57.240 --> 57:02.400
gonna maybe take extra steps being a serial killer would be a big step I

57:02.400 --> 57:04.760
don't think many people would be serial killers just because they think they

57:04.760 --> 57:11.280
could get away with it better right I think they're like the markets it's my

57:11.280 --> 57:15.680
time now I'm so well educated in this but I think the average kind of killer

57:15.680 --> 57:19.360
who like you know decapitates their spouse and then tries to call in I

57:19.360 --> 57:23.240
think they probably are gonna be more sophisticated but then law enforcement

57:23.240 --> 57:27.640
is constantly getting more sophisticated yeah and I think the pieces that people

57:27.640 --> 57:33.240
are better at understanding now like luminol or you know DNA and things like

57:33.240 --> 57:36.760
that but there's so many different parts to the investigation like when we

57:36.760 --> 57:39.880
talked about like Chris Watts the guy who killed his wife and his kids that's

57:39.880 --> 57:44.160
like a really recent case the number of unbelievably stupid things he does like

57:44.160 --> 57:48.320
googling things making calls from his phone to like figure out where he can

57:48.320 --> 57:53.280
dispose of his wife's body I'm like what were you what were you doing thinking

57:53.280 --> 57:56.800
it just also seems like and I think this is especially true in London right like

57:56.800 --> 58:01.680
there's just cameras everywhere like you can't not be a camera I mean the most

58:01.680 --> 58:06.880
cc's TV'd city in the world yeah yeah it's true I think I don't know if this is

58:06.880 --> 58:12.440
true anymore but at one point certainly I read that your call on cctv about 300

58:12.440 --> 58:16.800
times a day in London right although a lot of places in London they it's

58:16.800 --> 58:20.160
cheaper just to put a camera out in front of your place and not plug it in

58:20.160 --> 58:24.200
like just to look like you have a cctv yeah absolutely that's really common so

58:24.200 --> 58:28.480
there's there's loads of blind spots in London and people know exactly where

58:28.480 --> 58:32.360
they are and if you're gonna get into a fight or commit a crime then they know

58:32.360 --> 58:36.240
where the cameras aren't plugged in yeah I remember going to like an anarchist

58:36.240 --> 58:40.640
website probably 20 years ago now where it was like you could you could plug two

58:40.640 --> 58:45.760
locations in London into a like a map and it would show you the route where

58:45.760 --> 58:50.520
you could stay off camera yeah just for them it was just a matter of principle I

58:50.520 --> 58:59.600
guess I was at a casino in in Reno Nevada and a guy grabbed a friend of mine

58:59.600 --> 59:06.440
this woman like grabbed her by the crotch like Trump style and because he's a

59:06.440 --> 59:13.000
horrible human being right and I grabbed the guy and security came over and they

59:13.000 --> 59:16.760
go if you want to kick his ass go to the parking lot and go to the right and

59:16.760 --> 59:21.240
stand by this one thing because the cameras don't work there for a reason

59:21.240 --> 59:24.720
that's where the security that's where they go and they fuck people up right

59:24.720 --> 59:28.400
they got okay if you're gonna go deal with this guy here's where you here's

59:28.400 --> 59:32.240
where you fucking go that there's cameras but it but those ones don't work

59:32.240 --> 59:36.920
for a reason because that's what shit gets dealt with do you think that true

59:36.920 --> 59:41.640
crime fans are more or less predisposed to like be wanting to commit crimes though

59:41.640 --> 59:45.240
because I might believe like people with a bent for justice might be more prone

59:45.240 --> 59:49.760
to do true crimes so then maybe they're less likely to even do these kinds of

59:49.760 --> 59:52.240
crimes so then the kinds of people who like this stuff aren't the kinds of

59:52.240 --> 59:55.600
people who are gonna use it to get away from crimes I don't know talking

59:55.600 --> 01:00:03.760
talking hey guys like like I've read a bunch of like true crime stuff and

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:09.400
fictional crime stuff and what the police always say is smart people are

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:13.520
the first ones to get caught hmm because they think that they know what

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:17.600
they're doing well like and they and they also think that they can't get caught

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:23.280
and also what because they're smart when presented with evidence and logic

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:29.320
they're they go oh you've got me stupid people get away with it because stupid

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:33.120
people don't see logic and just don't fucking care well did you got well here

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:38.840
and and and here's where the the the tween meet did you is this name is Josh

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:44.240
Powell is that the the the pow the Powell guy that I think he was Mormon by the

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:50.280
way Mormons we got to talk like like like listening to true crime it's like

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:57.560
like yeah I will put a pin in that but the the the Powell guys this is the guy

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:03.440
who drove out to the drove out somewhere came back without his wife in Utah and

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:11.200
then like forever they're investigating him and then he eventually the two

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.600
kids he he killed them like and set his house on fire you guys know what I'm

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:25.160
talking about yeah the cold podcast that that guy like he he he had seen a true

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:29.760
crime case like in Utah or something there was some comparable case that he

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:35.400
was documented as having studied basically and the lesson that his not

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:40.400
entirely bright mind but incredibly sociopathic mind had learned was simply

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:48.440
don't lie as like like like tell as few lies as possible if you if you're gonna

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:54.240
invent a person for instance that like killed your spouse in the alley don't

01:01:54.240 --> 01:02:00.120
don't say you don't you didn't see their face don't say you saw it and that they

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.640
were Latino and they were wearing a fedora like it you're gonna the more

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.920
details you give the more you're gonna get cornered and caught the guy was just

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:14.080
it was like he was like the it was childish the way he like the cops sat him

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.720
down and guzzled there they're just like the cops were almost addicted to shame

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:21.680
and the part of the perpetrator where they're like well this is the part where

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:25.680
we corner you and you eventually like just admit that you can't lie anymore

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:29.960
but he just he had like this weird superpower where he was like yeah yeah I

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.240
guess I guess you're I guess that does sound crazy and then just silence and

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:40.240
they're like and and he's like and nothing and he kind of any just that he

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:45.440
found the the the it reminded me a lot of Donald Trump's effect on like like the

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.560
media and things where it was just like we're not we're we don't know how to

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:53.440
deal with this we've never had someone just like would know they're not smart

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.120
they're not stupid they're just he just like went through like he just didn't he

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.960
just said as little as possible and then just sat there and he he got away with

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:07.560
it until he and then he let him kill himself and his kid anyways like like

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:11.840
that we used to say because there was a that's many people asking that question

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:15.160
how do you how would you how would you get away with murder having studied all

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.800
this stuff the answer used to be have a boat I don't think that's true at all

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:23.320
they're covered with cameras everyone that's the new way to solve a crime have

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:27.760
a boat it was good before there was cameras everywhere now now the answer is

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:32.560
just don't actually like like as long as you can actually get rid of the body

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:40.560
like like don't just say nothing like and let it get used to the feeling of

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:46.520
everyone pointing at you and screaming murderer but that just react to that like

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:51.000
man and then I'll have a sandwich like and then like our society it doesn't

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.440
know what to do with that person right I think in terms of like how to get away

01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:00.880
with murder if we're going there and someone not connected you to you in

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:07.040
any way that's how you do it and then also what I would do and is if you inject

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:11.400
someone who's not diabetic with insulin they have a heart attack okay we should

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:18.600
cut this out it's very easy to get insulin that's crazy and it's naturally

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:22.400
occurring in the human body so they don't test for it hell yeah we're fucking

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:30.280
solving problems on her that's crazy that leads to a question I've always I've

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.280
always kind of had about true crime or a crime in general which is like do we

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:41.480
think that there's a and I don't know if the term should be serial killer or not

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:47.320
but like yeah I guess it should be like do we how do I how do I phrase this

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:54.920
question is there a is there a fringe of incredibly successful serial killers

01:04:54.920 --> 01:05:06.320
who are so like good at what they do that they have body counts in astronomical

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.480
numbers and will never be caught and have never been caught or is it like no

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.600
we just we catch them eventually you know what I mean I don't know how to

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:19.600
phrase the question it's sort of like most of the time I think they do realize

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.000
that it's a serial hopefully but I do also think serial murders are the

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.680
hardest to solve we talk about it's quite a lot on the show because they do do

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.480
exactly what Hannah just said they kill people that they don't know there's no

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:33.760
connection and no connection between the victims no connection between them and

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.240
the victim so it's really hard for them to connect the dots and realize and I

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:42.000
think there are definitely serial killers out there with huge huge head

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.960
counts head counts well that's not the body counts especially if they've been

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:51.000
killing people that societies and care about right and if they're really good

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.320
we don't know prostitutes die all the time and that's what lots of serial in

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:59.040
LA there's like a serial killer that's just been like busting homeless people's

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:02.240
heads and then it just kind of like he killed a bunch of people and then

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.480
stopped and people were just like yep don't know what happened and like that

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:12.440
proud person might be still doing it family that's that's banging down the

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:17.800
doors on the police station saying like follow up on this right nobody cares

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.160
even when there is sometimes the thing is if it's like we've talked about cases

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:25.520
where the victims are sex workers and they're the narrative will be oh well

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.760
no one was looking for them or no one was telling the they were there were they

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.280
had you know mothers and fathers and sisters and social workers telling the

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:36.920
police to look but the thing is serial killer investigations are so expensive

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:42.900
and it's resourcing and it's about who how much was this person worth to

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:49.680
society right not a whole lot yeah if she's if she's a blonde rich girl then

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:53.720
then there's more like traction on that and there's also that element of victim

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.520
blaming like Dan was talking about the start in terms of well what do you expect

01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:03.600
you were you were homeless or you were a sex worker or you were doing this so it

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:09.000
was bound to happen eventually this was inevitable yeah and I think that there's

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.240
definitely an element of that so I think definitely there are serial killers out

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:16.640
there with huge body counts that we haven't tracked down because of who they

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.880
were killing and where they're doing it as well like it's a communication between

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:23.880
police department that's the truck driver thing right like that guy that was

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:27.840
just or that guy might still be not caught right like isn't there some

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:31.720
American like truck driver guy they think he's a truck driver sure there's

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:36.240
loads that just like they're starting to put the thing together like the idea

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:40.200
that this person has just been murdering like what do they call them lot

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:44.600
lizards I don't know what the term is for the like the the sex workers that

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:48.120
frequent like truck stops and things like that hitchhikers and things like and

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:52.480
that you just like if you they just study the jurisdictions and they go this

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.600
these investigations will never be yeah they will never be related to in any

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:01.920
single investigators mine I think of one thing I'd love to add to that those

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.040
and more and more now those we talked about it on a couple of episodes with

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:10.280
the DNA stuff now people just giving all of their DNA to these private companies

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.600
and then they're put into publicly searchable databases the police can

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:17.560
search through them and then they caught the Golden State killer last year yeah

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.280
I don't know how I feel about that at all it's crazy it's it's absolutely

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:26.560
impossible to have a conversation where your anti-catch a horrible predator you

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:32.120
can't come down against that but it I never predicted that this would happen I

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.560
always predicted that we would have a point as a society where we got to have

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:39.040
an increasingly difficult debate right we've never done any of that for any

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.920
technology we we we I always I remember when they started putting chips in cats

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:49.040
yeah like my cat had a microchip in it and I was like where's this going and it

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.440
was it was it was safe to have that because they were like thinking about

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:55.320
well let's do that on prisoners too and that way you wouldn't even need as many

01:08:55.320 --> 01:09:02.280
bars the chip is the bar like just like but and they always start with house

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:05.840
pets and prisoners and then our children because we love our children we

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.640
don't anything bad to happen to them and then like civil liberties start

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:13.920
increasingly and and so all of a sudden one day the Golden State killers caught

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:18.080
and then it was almost like a footnote that by the way the way he was caught was

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:22.360
this incredibly like way too late to have a debate about it or Wellie and

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:26.440
threshold we've crossed where because we all want to know how much Neanderthal

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:29.560
we have in us we swap our cheeks and send it to these services and then

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:34.040
somewhere along the way everyone just it's like oh holy shit you can just I

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:39.960
how do we feel about that conflicted I think because yeah you have the the

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:43.160
success stories of like the Golden State killer and now they're running the DNA

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.080
for like the Zodiac killer and they're like we're gonna get him and all this

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.520
and yeah cool but then like the stories that are missed is there are so many

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.840
articles about particularly when we were reading about the Golden State killer

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:58.760
and we did that case about the 40 year old case the bodies in the barrel the

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.280
bear yeah and when we were doing the research for that I read an article

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.520
about a guy who was a high school teacher there had been a couple of rapes

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:12.920
in the town that he was living in and he he had his his data his DNA was in the

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:17.040
database they said it was him they arrested him they took him in they held

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:22.160
him didn't charge him turns out it was like his nephew or something and by the

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:26.080
time they were able to identify who it really was his life is over he can't be

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:32.160
a teacher anymore even if he's proven not to be anybody really want him around

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:35.840
their kids anymore I don't know I mean you can you could you could I mean I

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:41.560
think Trump's gonna win in 2020 on the slogan no collusion oh he's going to win

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:46.760
and then I just thought it's kind of I didn't expect that I said I guess we're

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.480
a little worn out also there was no way that the more report was going to be

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:54.400
what anybody wanted he's right I just left that idea that it was like that's

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:57.280
the big triumph is it gonna be like remember when you thought I was a

01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:05.600
Russian agent I wasn't yeah like it's like I like Ike it's just sort of it's

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:09.840
a little bit more of a negative society when you're doing there I am not a

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:15.920
crook wasn't Nixon's slogan right it was a thing he said while he was being

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.480
forced out of society it was a thing he said it was before he was a protest before

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:26.280
he resigned it was an impotent like plaintiff whale you don't have to resign

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:31.880
now you can be a complete asshole and get reelected he's going to be reelected

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:35.720
sorry anyway that did remind me of one thing I would never look at this

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:41.040
podcast reviews but I did look at yours because I was just curious and you guys

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:46.240
got a flood this fucking pissed me off like I like you guys got a bunch of one

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:53.720
star reviews that were people that your Central Park five episode going like I

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:57.280
used to like this podcast but I didn't know it was gonna be about shaming the

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:04.000
American president oh yeah he wasn't president when he became famous for

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.840
taking out a full he's part of a true crime story right he's part of the

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.520
story like we got I think we got one in the UK as well this guy really all these

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.600
big girls do you talk about Trump all the time this happened 30 years ago why

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:21.080
is he being brought he's in the story like what you want me to do it's like a

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:28.600
fun knife that stabbed someone then became a senator later it was there it's

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.000
part of the story I mean it's not like you guys like take a big break and go

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.560
like by the way here's what we hate about America it was like I just thought

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.640
it was so amazing that but there was like yeah there was like like clearly a

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.000
big cluster of people are like one star and particularly for people who are

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.080
like I used to like you and then I found out that you that you don't like it when

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:52.160
people try to kill people with so glad you enjoyed 79 hours of pre-content

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:58.360
before you yelled at us right yeah one thing yeah but it's fine but I also do

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.960
that I will start listening to show if they say one thing I don't I know it's

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:05.560
almost uplifting that they that someone from that demo couldn't get through all

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:10.000
those episodes because I it's just an it's just an anglophile thing if I hear

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.120
an English accent I assume you hate me and I'm not even I'm as liberal as the

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:18.960
day is long but I like I'm just like well they would think I was tacky I mean

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.160
listen to them they sound like James Bond I like J.K. Rowling on Twitter is

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:29.640
fucking hilarious and someone said like because she like outed like gay

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:34.240
characters she just recently confirmed that a Dumbledore and Grindelwald had

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:38.800
all sorts of crazy nasty sex yeah but like do you guys hear about this yeah

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.080
yeah and someone heard they did they cannon didn't in a dumpster behind

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:50.440
Hogwarts Hogwarts has a dumpster yeah that's what's so weird it's like she's

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:53.720
trying to make all these characters gay but it's like it's getting really thin

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:58.120
these justifications I don't think there was a dumpster she's less into

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:02.320
magic and we're into this PC agenda hot meat sure but a dumpster it's weird

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:07.040
somebody somebody treated her like I I I found out that you're into gay culture

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:11.880
and like I took all I have all your movies I took all the CDs out and I'm

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:17.480
gonna burn them on my lawn and on the lawn yeah and J.K. Rowling tweeted back

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:25.200
said that's great because the fumes are toxic and I have your money

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:32.000
fuck you can I ask a true crime oh yeah go ahead it's just like okay so I don't

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.240
do true crime a lot but it feels like there might be if you could just

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.520
separate it there's like there's crimes that are kind of solved and there are

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.720
the details and then there's crimes where you don't have all the details do

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.320
you prefer one or the other is both part of it is one more fascinating because I

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:48.160
don't know I was thinking that it's like part of it's like the search for

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:51.640
truth it's like the unknown is there and can I piece it together but there's

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:55.560
another part that's like oh here's all the details and maybe I can own all

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:58.760
these details and use that knowledge which is kind of the opposite of like a

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.680
search for truth in the void I don't know does that mean anything yeah I think

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:06.760
like in terms of the cases that we do a episode every week possibly misguidedly

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:12.080
but we're here now and so time-wise we've just got to keep turning them out

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.040
everything has to be ready to go on Tuesday night and so what we really want

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:21.920
to do is do a long-form show about one particular case like a Dr. Death or a

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:27.280
happy face or something like that and where we have the time to like properly

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:32.680
investigate and get a lot more and a lot more of the details together but

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:39.160
primarily what we're doing on red-handed is storytelling so it's just finding

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.840
finding what we can and piecing together the story right how do you find them

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:49.880
like what's your like your like source for like picking your topic I mean the

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:55.600
internet hell yeah and I mean linked to that question I really enjoy the ones

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:59.080
where there's not all the details out there and we can piece it together and

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:04.440
interpret it in a different way but I think it just comes down to time yeah

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:09.480
we'll text each other something I'm like I need an easy one this week and by that I mean there's a

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.360
whole shit ton of documentaries out there and there's all this information I

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:15.760
can read it put it together and it's like I said we're not doing an

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:20.400
investigative podcast we're doing a storytelling one with our opinions in

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:25.040
there so it's just time but the interest is really with the ones where

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:28.280
there's not that much out there right that's what I'm more captivated by

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.440
myself but again I'm not a huge fan so I was wondering yeah all right sorry Dan

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:35.160
do you think the guy from the the staircase do you think that dude that

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:39.680
killed her or his son killed her what do you think about that one what's his

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:49.320
name Peterson Peterson yeah Jordan Peterson I don't know I don't know yeah I

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:52.480
don't know either I'm on the fence I'm afraid I actually yeah it's weird because

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.600
it's like I remember I was there's an old forensic files where it's just like

01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:00.560
plain and simple like when I can't even remember now yeah I think they're the

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.200
old forensic files it's just like this is a story about a guy who pushed his

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:06.680
wife down the stairs and tried to act like he didn't we got him through

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:10.920
forensics and that was like the 90s or something and then there was the whole

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:17.600
documentary and like there's yeah it's I'm whipped back and forth all over the

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:22.360
place every time that story I think he and the son did it I think he and he and

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:27.800
the kid let's do some other classics so that somebody asked in the

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:33.360
subreddit what about Madeline McCann we get this all the time they just they just

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:36.560
want us to talk about Madeline McCann because she's British talk about yeah

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:41.520
yeah but I don't know I feel like Madeline McCann was a guy I don't know

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:48.680
everybody knows yeah yeah Madeline McCann was a four-year-old girl she was on

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:52.880
she's British she was on holiday with her two parents in Portugal they were

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:58.040
doctors by the way yeah that's an important part of the story and then they are

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.240
like you know having a good time they'd like go have dinner every night in this

01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:05.640
restaurant with their friends and leave the kids in the apartment unlocked or

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:10.160
unlocked or on their own and then they'd be like it's just like having dinner in

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:14.120
the garden but it's like it's fucking far like it's not like having dinner in

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:19.560
your garden and then one night they go to so they basically do a rotor of one of

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:23.000
the people having tapas going and checking on all the kids every like 15

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.640
minutes and they go in the room and then Madeline's gone but then her brother

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:32.360
and sister asleep in the room too and so really it's either she wandered out and

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:37.680
she fell down a well or something I don't know or she was abducted or the

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:41.480
parents killed her and then the whole investigation was did the parents do it

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.280
or not because when the mum comes out of the room the first thing she says is

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:48.360
they've taken her I was just gonna say maybe they were involved in some kind of

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:52.880
high-end dark art like cult thing and they were like give us your favorite one

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:59.400
yeah the wait wait why is they've taken her what I just think if you were like

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.680
she was kind of sounds like she was expecting something to happen like who's

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:07.240
there if your kid was missing and you saw when you just be like she had like

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:11.000
details that she wouldn't have known right it just seems like but this is the

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.160
classic thing right yeah like judging someone whose kids just been snatched

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:21.760
a lot of people have it's like okay so use this as an example so so this is like

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:27.640
why is this case like extremely like it's a magnet for everybody the reason is

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:31.880
because there's enough room for speculation that it just in it's a

01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.360
sandbox for everybody right and then and then there's this other question of

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:42.800
okay so it at what point are we you know do we ever think about families of

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:48.920
victims suspects when the stuff is still unsolved no matter how cold the case

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:54.560
may be do we how do we deal with the karma the thought of like these are

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:57.520
human beings that move on through their life they haven't been convicted they

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:03.240
haven't been in there don't they have a right to like listen to podcasts and

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:07.800
like do we ever do you guys run this through in your head like what if what

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:13.200
if so-and-so or their family or whatever is listening yeah I do I worry

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:18.520
about that quite a lot and we just have to be okay with the fact that we feel

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:24.240
like most of the cases we've done we never laugh at the victim we're never

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:31.200
mocking the victim so I would hope that they wouldn't ever feel like we were you

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:37.360
guys a little hard on the tandem bicycle couple yeah part five thing is a little

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:43.160
snobby yeah where we do where we are snobs two people in love might get on a

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:46.320
tandem bike and ride it through Central Park that's true I just have never seen

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:52.480
it in the wild it also it also destroyed our scene setting of New York in the

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:57.480
80s yeah I did all this work divided city in the rich getting richer and

01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:06.600
more getting poor and others that's why they did not deserve to be questioned

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:11.560
like they are anyway sorry we spent the first 15 minutes that episode talking

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:15.960
about the AIDS epidemic the crack epidemic the gang wars and I did a lot

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:19.040
of research into the crack epidemic and we talked about it all and then the

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:23.840
next paragraph was and then it was 9 30 p.m. in Central Park in Central Park 5

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:27.400
in Central Park and this couple right past on a tandem bike like I probably wrote

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:34.280
that poorly that was probably they they believed the pamphlets I mean they

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:40.360
almost paid with their lives the yeah so like so Madeline McCann like you get

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:44.480
where are you guys standing it sounds like you're thinking like like now I

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:48.160
now I feel gross because we now we just touched on the topic of what I like like

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:54.480
I it feels grody to then go what do you think the parents did it well a lot of

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:58.000
people do think that the parents did it until this new Netflix documentary came

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.760
out and I've had a lot of people who were like staunch her parents did it who'd

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:04.400
now changed their minds I haven't watched it yet watching it and I can't

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.880
tell if the Netflix documentary is exonerating them if it feels like that

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:11.200
because it's just incredibly sluggish and they haven't gotten to the point where

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:15.720
they start crucifying the first episode is just you watch the first you can

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.720
skip the first episode of that Madeline McCann documentary unless you want to

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:22.200
know lots and lots of unnecessary information about prior delusion the

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:25.920
80s like I don't know one of the things where like the parents shook the kid

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:30.640
killed the kid and said oh fuck we just killed our kid now we got the theory is

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:35.160
that they sedated her well not the theory a theory is that they sedated her

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:39.320
and then they go off to dinner so they can have a great time and they come back

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:42.840
and she's dead oh that's the thing people do that the people drug their kids

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:47.040
like instead of having babies they just dope them up and that's why Hannah said

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:50.880
it's important that their doctors I mean God forbid that they're that they're

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.000
innocent and then all of this is being said but it's like the other their

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.760
occupation like draws that you're like what if your doctors and you're you know

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:05.000
you you just want your kids to sleep while you go have don't they know that

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.720
that's dangerous I mean you're not I don't think you're supposed to administer

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:11.160
sedatives all the time like that well I got I got converted this is the the

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.840
interesting thing about this to me is that the reason the way that we found

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:21.680
the guy that I call Asperger detective I have you if you listen no I just I

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:26.400
really want you to listen to his podcast I'm not saying that you're like him like

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:34.000
I hope so like he's like he is just such a like he's so yeah okay it's like he's

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:40.080
so what I want to know whether you would love him or hate him I'm excited I he's

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.600
a very interesting guy what's it called what's the podcast it's it's such a weird

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:48.960
forgettable name it's like it's like his that's part of what I love about he's

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:55.160
really not like a marketing guru he's not a person person he owns it he's like

01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:02.280
he's like he's not a person person his his reviews are 50% one star 50% five

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:06.840
stars are like what the fuck is this guy's problem usually so self

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:10.080
congratulatory and he's sort of like all these things and I'm like I'm like well

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:14.120
if you're gonna hate somebody for this stuff then he's my hero and then the

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.920
other ones are like he's so deep and thoughtful and interesting because he

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:23.200
sorry I'm babbling but but he the from with the reason we found his podcast is

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:28.000
because Rosanna is that her name Rosanna from the kill killer for near

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.840
dreaming who's another favorite of ours she was she was asked she just does

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:37.360
California dreaming she just does California I want to put myself in the

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:42.240
balls she's great she's great hearing that she's great like she's not great

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.640
it's a terrible she's great well these people aren't like fucking like they

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:51.040
don't go to like graphic design school for their logos they don't go to like how

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:55.200
like branding school like they're they're really into true crime and like some of

01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:01.040
the best people have the worst like California dreaming but she focuses on

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:05.560
California and she's truly she's really good and if I kill somebody it's gonna

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:10.400
be someone that calls their podcast California dream interesting thing is I

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:15.720
have a boat she's very thorough and she's very academic and somebody asked her

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:23.200
she's dead I knew it somebody asked her is there any true if she turns up dead

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:30.800
tomorrow or missing I did it you're going to jail based on a title yes they get

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:37.680
worse oh what yeah no like what's worse than kill a friend okay they don't get

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:42.800
worse I love you to come up with a worst name of true crime there's like one

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.720
that's like all Austin true crime and it's called like killers and cattle or

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:51.560
something I don't know it's I really like like all crime no cattle I can't it's

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:54.960
like it's not really trying to make a Texas thing happen just let me finish

01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:00.920
my thought okay I'm just gonna I just realize I'm a murderer and I've told

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:06.360
you all and I'm fine doing the time Rosanna from California dreaming was as

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:12.360
a Cody told me this that that she was asked is there a case that you changed

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:17.800
your mind on based on an episode of another person's true crime podcast so

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.360
these are really interesting question that I'd like to ask you guys but

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:29.600
and she said yes Asperger detectives treat she didn't call him that this guy

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:34.980
his his podcast is called I mean I'm gonna give I'm gonna give him gives his

01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:41.600
due signal boost I mean I look I love the guy and same deal buddy I'll fly you

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:48.680
out from Los Angeles he lives in LA it's totally affordable I can't I can't

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:55.800
remember it's called like cold case it's murder files mold cold case murder

01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:02.000
mysteries Cody said cold case murder mysteries he's yeah he's this guy and he

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.360
talks like this and he never stops talking like this like you won't I mean

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:14.000
like like look you've been he's polarizing but he is like he he approaches

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.360
the she said yes his treatment of the Madeleine McCain story like it changed

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:23.640
her mind and when you listen to it that's that's the episode I would recommend

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:27.800
if you want to get into this guy as his Madeleine McCain episode because he just

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:34.360
sort of makes it seem incredibly obvious that there was never a plan they what

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:39.360
they they were on vacation they were they were using micro doses of like you

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:42.680
know kind of sedative that they were they're very comfortable with as a

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.200
professional couple of doctors they were like just keeping the kids there was a

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:51.560
there the kids already on the trip had been actually getting up out of bed and

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:56.880
like you know they they just they crossed a threshold of like let's just

01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:06.240
Nyquilum but on a pro level and and that and that actually like not that they

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.720
they didn't ODM because you're correct they wouldn't do that they would know

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:17.200
the right amount and what actually did happen is that the the kid was high and

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:24.360
got up still and was tooling around the place alone and like was playing on like

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:30.520
the spot where the one of the the dogs did go to when they were investigating one

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:35.360
of the corp sniffing dogs like descended on this one area of the the room

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:41.640
where the Asperger detective I have to stop calling him that case murder

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:46.560
mystery says says that that's she probably she maybe like fell off the

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:50.920
couch she was for right it's like like it's just she maybe climbed up on top and

01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:55.680
like fell and like the just freak accident total freak accident they they

01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:03.400
found out about it and then they kind of like just worked out a thing where they

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:10.720
like and it's actually like that that version of events I I feel bad for the

01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:16.600
for the parents if that really happened because they they would be in a they

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:20.160
would be their lives would be fucked they come home to that and that's like

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:24.240
it's a tragedy I'm not saying any it's but it's just like imagine that and it's

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:29.120
like oh god the what do any of us do when we're pushed to the point where a lie

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:33.680
is equidistant from from the truth in terms of like how much it fucks up your

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:39.040
life where you're like I don't I don't know what I'm made of and if I'm ever

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.240
put in a position like that I'm not sure we kind of like we've all been in

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:47.480
situations where like we're gonna lie was just just easier did they find the

01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:52.600
child and did they do an autopsy no they've never found a trace of the kid

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:57.160
which is in its in and of itself it's just incredibly strange I mean how do

01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:00.880
you I think that's the thing that makes it feel like it's not the parents

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:06.040
because if they if they did do it I do think it's like you said Dan like they

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:10.200
it was an accident they didn't maliciously murder a bunch of other kids

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:15.600
they're not like we hate kids we want to live a free life exactly and they're in

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:19.760
a foreign country they don't they're not from Portugal they're on holiday there

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:23.040
they're in like a holiday resort where have they taken this four-year-old's

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:26.000
body that the British police went and helped as well so the Portuguese

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.920
police and the British police are looking for Maddie and they never found her

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:34.320
and the parents in a foreign country were able to dispose of this four-year-old's

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.720
body that well that's the thing that doesn't make sense to me it's also just

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:43.240
strange the idea of like a rando that comes in a back door and takes a kid

01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:52.400
how do they that that was one of AD's points was like this is a V center

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:58.000
Asperger this is a this is a sloppy crime you don't it's isn't like it's not

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:04.320
like specter or like you know whatever the bad guys name you can't say it was

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:09.520
like I must have like this one it wasn't like an it's not an organized thing you

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:15.440
go in and snatch a kid and if they did take them they took them in a it's like

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:21.120
that person doesn't then put the energy and resources into making someone

01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:25.920
vanish right exactly and I think like snatching a kid like Madeleine McCann

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:30.440
is incredibly high-risk like it's the same thing with Amy Bradley like

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:33.360
kidnapping someone who's on a cruise ship where there's physically nowhere to

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:38.320
go like why you what is the gain for you that is so huge that makes that worth

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:43.720
it in such a high like high-risk high-state you guys think happened to her

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:52.840
on the cruise ship Amy Bradley do you think she fell overboard I think give

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:57.720
me the meat and potatoes of that I don't know you're talking about Amy Bradley

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:04.240
American lady I think she was in her early 20s I think I went on a cruise with

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:10.000
her family and she disappeared as they were like out to see like round Aruba

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.560
and and there's all this stuff they get to Aruba they can't find us she's been

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.960
missing for hours but they're on a ship they're on a ship they're like

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:20.200
well she's clearly here we just don't know where so they did a bit of a half

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:24.360
ass search anyway they never found her and there was a couple of sightings of

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:30.880
her this one guy who's just the worst human being said that he contacted her

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:34.240
family said I know where I know where she is she's living on a compound with

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:38.280
this man who's got sleeve tattoos and long blonde hair I can extract her for

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:41.480
you so they sent him all of this money and it was all bullshit it wasn't true

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:45.640
and so he was just sitting on an island in the Caribbean off their money for

01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:49.560
months at a time anyway so the leading theories are that she was sold into sex

01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:53.080
slavery there's because it's the Dutch Caribbean where she was so obviously it

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:59.480
has the same laws as the Netherlands for sex work etc and and there's a picture

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:03.960
which people think is her from years later on like one of these like sex

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:09.680
holiday websites but she was extracted off of this cruise ship yeah somehow maybe

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:13.960
that's a theory yeah or she fell overboard but like bodies generally wash

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:18.760
up like they weren't that far out to sea it's a it's a it's a nightmare scenario

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:24.440
because it's like you find out like that these these cruise lines they're they're

01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:31.080
owned by they're not accountable to the laws that we think they are they're

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:35.520
like they purposely even if they are American corporations they purposely

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:42.720
work through international law because that makes it a lot easier to abuse

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:46.960
labor for instance the guy teaching you shuffleboard can only be paid a penny if

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:50.600
you're not an American you know who this is a case for

01:33:50.600 --> 01:34:02.200
ass broken I will I will okay I mean I guess I'm not surprised we burnt through all our time but I did I like I always

01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:06.560
like what do you guys have a I don't know what the word favorite means in this

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.880
context do you have a favorite case I whatever that means to you and then I'm

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:16.880
gonna tell you mine one that we've done on the show or not I have if you're one

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:20.780
that you can't do because you it's too gross because that's another question

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:23.320
which I think the answer is no too like is there something that's somehow off

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.800
limits are you asking is the one that's unsolved that there's the most

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:31.600
fascinating or I leave it to you whatever the word favorite might mean I

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:38.440
don't know like we do have one that we won't ever do Junco oh yeah we'd never

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:51.640
do Junco for a term I don't know what that is it's really really bad I think

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:54.520
we've done a lot of research and come back to your first question of like how

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:59.680
much does this fuck you up Junco Fruto is the only case that I looked at and

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:06.320
read about that I was like in I was in floods of tears after what happened to

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:11.480
that girl is horrifying interestingly though before I forget like what like I

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:20.160
think Jeff did it an astounding thing these girls do a Halloween episode have

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:23.800
you done how many you have a you've only been on for done to okay you've done two

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:29.720
Halloween's their Halloween episodes are like they go out of their way to go

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:35.560
into find the worst possible shit even relative to true crime desensitization

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:39.280
like the word it's it really is super effective by the way like I don't know

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:42.280
if those are like your more popular episodes because I honestly like I don't

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.440
I don't go to these things kidding myself like I'm here to be a hero I it's the

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:51.760
opposite like I'm I go to true crime to take a break from the pressure of like

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.200
that exists of like oh if I choose right or wrong I'm a good or a bad person and

01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:00.840
I'm listening to where the pinball machine breaks down like as Spencer

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:06.240
alluded to it's like debugging society you're like going okay well this is this

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:10.720
you'll Brenner in Westworld like went nuts and started shooting up the saloon

01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:16.200
like I gravitate towards that I want to know details I don't I don't I would

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.440
never bother to go as far as to say it's because I want to prevent it from

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:23.200
happening or it's because I love the people so much or because I think I

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:27.560
might be the guy that did it it's it's all just like rubber-necking it's just

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:32.720
sort of like what what went wrong what happened how does this work how it's

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:42.240
just I don't know why that we gravitate to that stuff you wait but we we got you

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:45.600
said you wouldn't do that one guy that's too fucked up right do you have like

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:52.000
what's yeah do you have a favorite it's a dumb question it makes no sense what's

01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:00.000
our favorite like murder story it doesn't make my cereal ad-nan you guys

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.800
hear about this ad-nan fellow okay I'll tell you look here's my thing I'll talk

01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:12.720
for a while I tried I have a family dang it's a platform this is my this is my

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:18.240
request because I've done I don't remember who did that I think maybe true

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:24.160
crime garage did did did her but I don't hear a lot about her and I continue to

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:28.680
be confounded about what could possibly have happened and why there's not more

01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:35.040
investigation canica Powell I think she lived in Maryland I she's American for

01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:44.200
sure she if you look it up canica K.A. and I K.A. Powell young lady who her

01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:50.800
apartment like a guy comes to her apartment door knocks on the door and

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:55.440
says he's an FBI agent she's looking through the people the nightmare of this

01:37:55.440 --> 01:38:00.120
story the reason people gravitate to it is because she does everything right she

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:06.840
never does anything wrong and it it she looks to the people and the guy says I'm

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:11.080
an FBI agent can I come in I want to talk to you about something and she goes

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:16.360
he holds up a badge and she's like she asks him some question I can't remember

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:21.640
was like do you have a badge number or like is there she knows to ask him

01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:26.160
something and he just fucking walks away and it's like the middle of the night

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:30.320
and she then goes over to her window and she watches this strange dude who just

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:34.600
pretended to be an FBI agent walking away from her apartment building and she

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:40.120
hears another male voice saying that guy yeah she doesn't see the source of the

01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:44.040
voice but she could she she's she's reasonably know this is because she she

01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:49.120
keeps records she emails friends and family about these incidents that she

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:53.720
hears another voice saying other way or something like that and the guy turns

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:56.160
around and walks the other way she doesn't see the source of the voice

01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:59.200
he's gonna round the corner one way and then he goes the opposite direction I

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:02.560
mean I'm already tears if the story ended there I'm like

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:11.080
she emails there's emails online that's part of what's attractive about the case

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:16.080
is that it's just so it's it feels like real life creepypasta because she's we

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:20.040
have your emails that she's sending to her friends and family and I where she's

01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:25.840
explaining what happened to her and then five days later another knock at her

01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:34.320
door and a different guy at the door says I have a package for you and she goes

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:39.240
where is it or something like again she doesn't she doesn't do anything stupid

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:44.720
she reacts exactly the way you're supposed to react and the guy leaves and

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:50.680
doesn't leave a package it's a different guy she is like this is in a span of a

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:58.040
week she works for a laboratory that does work for Homeland Security that's

01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:02.320
part of also why this is such a freaking freak out because you can't ask the

01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:08.200
cops can't ask her job anything about who she works with like like is this

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:12.960
someone and she had one of those jobs that where if you asked her what she

01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:16.560
did that day she had to tell you I'm not allowed to tell you now there's lots of

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:20.000
those jobs and they're not all area 51 like level shit but there's just some

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.560
certain jobs where you're not allowed to tell your family what you did that day

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:27.600
at work she had one of those jobs and and when the when the homicide

01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:34.560
investigators call her boss you know after she's spoilers dead the they they

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:39.800
keep telling the cops yeah we can't tell you anything about about her job and

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:46.880
who she worked with and anything and the cops are just like okay and so like so

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:49.920
those two incidents happened within five days and I think there was another

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.880
knock at her door and she's sending these emails to her mother and her

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:57.000
sisters it's heartbreaking she called this police right this yeah she calls the

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.880
police every time and the police come out and they talk to her and they look

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:03.880
for clues and they she calls the FBI because the guy said and the FBI says

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:08.480
yeah no that was definitely not an FBI agent we would never do that ever we

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:12.480
don't behave like that we blah blah blah there's like a whole slew of reasons

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:17.360
why that could not have been us thank you for not opening the door it this poor

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:25.640
girl like she she then emails again like her her family and goes I think she

01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:28.400
was gonna take a vacation or something like that and she was like she so she

01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:33.880
had some errands to run so she took the day off of work after the last time she

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:41.360
talked to the cops specifically saying like I I don't want to come to leave or

01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:46.120
come back to my apartment building at nighttime because I'm a woman and I live

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:52.240
alone so I am going to call into work take off of work and like the minute

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:56.800
after she talks to the cops the the third time she goes from there and does

01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:01.720
her errands and she comes home from her errands and the guy that was the UPS

01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:06.960
packaged fake guy is in her hallway and shoots her to death and runs away and

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:13.560
that's it no robbery no sexual assault didn't want in her apartment just wanted

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:18.400
to kill her fine with killing her not in her apartment like didn't need to like

01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:25.440
multiple men yeah at least why isn't this a task force I what is going on like

01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:30.600
like this woman worked for a fucking lab that was a government contract like

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:35.200
like and so and everyone everyone online all the webslives keep saying like

01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:41.040
well you can rule out the idea of a government hit because it was so sloppy

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:49.400
like why would you have a fit if I if I if I work at if I work for a it's it's

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:56.960
that's that there's a if it's like we're not saying that like like the

01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:02.200
Illuminati killed her it's still possible for someone that that she worked

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:06.960
with to like like want her dead and have a couple friends and all the stuff like

01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:12.200

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.880
sometimes and I go like what the fuck it just makes me feel it unsafe like like

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:31.360
I I'm like how so people can just decide that you should be dead and then

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:34.920
