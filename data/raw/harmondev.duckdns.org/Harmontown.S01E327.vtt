sleep and it's\n\n02:11.280 --> 02:14.040\na it's an amazing Instagram video because it's just pitch black because Cody's\n\n02:14.040 --> 02:17.400\njust grabbing her camera and it's like in the beginning you can hear me like\n\n02:17.400 --> 02:23.840\nfreestyle rapping gibberish because you and it's like it starts in the distance\n\n02:23.840 --> 02:28.720\nand then gets closer because

there's there's contention about like whether or not it's\n\n02:40.600 --> 02:44.400\nbecause the streets are in my blood that's my theory right that I've been\n\n02:44.400 --> 02:49.720\nrapping so long that I'm now a real rapper and that's how we know I wrap in\n\n02:49.720 --> 02:55.440\nmy sleep Cody thinks is because that day I got I got drunk and I came home and I\n\n02:55.440 -->

about rattlesnakes\n\n20:10.720 --> 20:14.080\nbut no actual rattlesnakes yeah which is good because she had sandals on it's\n\n20:14.080 --> 20:17.800\ncalled to their hybrid inning right now but they're there they love it there's\n\n20:17.800 --> 20:24.280\nthat's true yeah yeah what's the most dangerous non-human life form in London\n\n20:24.280 --> 20:39.680\nTheresa May is there like like like like here I would say like within Los\n\n20:39.680 --> 20:43.840\nAngeles city limits like the brown recluse or something like that like a\n\n20:43.840 --> 20:48.560\nspider that if it bites you you could like necrotize and lose your foot do\n\n20:48.560 --> 20:52.560\nyou have anything in London that's like a creepy crawly that could like kill you\n\n20:52.560 --> 20:59.720\nhurt you hospitalize you badges they're not badgers yeah TB they've got TB and\n\n20:59.720 --> 21:04.080\nthey don't stop fighting you until they hear your bones crack oh they've got TB\n\n21:04.080 --> 21:11.400\nyou have badgers that Rome London yeah we've got badgers foxes the foxes are a\n\n21:11.400 --> 21:15.240\nbit more like I've seen the foxes of them walking on the road and fucking\n\n21:15.240 --> 21:19.080\nshort it yeah there's a fucking fox that takes balls to be a fox and walk\n\n21:19.080 --> 21:22.760\nthrough London oh yeah that's like where they I mean like that's where they\n\n21:22.760 --> 21:29.280\ninvented like the the fox hunt yeah well it's illegal now yeah yeah but I mean\n\n21:29.280 --> 21:32.640\nstill the foxes don't know that I mean there it is like it must be in their\n\n21:32.640 --> 21:37.640\nDNA that you're not supposed to go near like Buckingham Palace the case the\n\n21:37.640 --> 21:43.440\nQueen rides out on your steed there's probably what do they call what kind of\n\n21:43.440 --> 21:49.640\nhorn do fox hunters blow bugle yeah bugle is it a bugle or they were the\n\n21:49.640 --> 21:52.920\nreally long one I'm not sure if I know what the name is a flugel horn flugel\n\n21:52.920 --> 22:01.680\nhorn flugel horn moving on moving on to true crime okay but yeah well so I did\n\n22:01.680 --> 22:06.680\nto ask the reddit the subreddit you know do you guys have anything you'd want to\n\n22:06.680 --> 22:12.960\nknow from these ladies I would say like a large share of the questions circle\n\n22:12.960 --> 22:19.720\naround the theme of is it traumatizing toxifying anxiety inducing is it fucking\n\n22:19.720 --> 22:23.880\nyou up in any way to be constantly thinking about people getting murdered\n\n22:23.880 --> 22:27.640\nand researching it and all that stuff and I I mean do you want to speak to that\n\n22:27.640 --> 22:33.040\nfirst I don't think we know yet what the damage is being done we'll find out in\n\n22:33.040 --> 22:37.920\nlike maybe five years it's like Wi-Fi is probably giving us herpes or something\n\n22:37.920 --> 22:43.520\nexactly wow it's just like lying dormant right now damage we're doing what was\n\n22:43.520 --> 22:47.640\nthe the impetus like what brought you into that into the world of true crime\n\n22:47.640 --> 22:52.040\npodcasting so we met at a party at Hannah's house we didn't know each other\n\n22:52.040 --> 22:56.240\ntwo years ago and kind of like what you and Cody were doing down we would just\n\n22:56.240 --> 23:01.440\nlisten to other true crime podcast and we were like that's alright and then when\n\n23:01.440 --> 23:05.520\nwe met we were like we could do this we should we should start a restaurant we\n\n23:05.520 --> 23:09.960\nshould start a podcast cupcake business exactly and then I left that party\n\n23:09.960 --> 23:16.320\nthinking I'll never see that guy but what's the allure for because I think\n\n23:16.320 --> 23:23.360\nit's a lot of women listen to of true crime podcast is it because well what\n\n23:23.360 --> 23:28.880\nis the alert with a prey aren't we so often and I think it's quite good to I\n\n23:28.880 --> 23:32.520\ndon't know I think it's just we're just morbidly fascinated somebody left us a\n\n23:32.520 --> 23:37.080\nreally negative review saying it's like you're morbidly fascinated yeah we are\n\n23:37.080 --> 23:40.920\nthere is kind of like you know there was there was that throughout the the reddit\n\n23:40.920 --> 23:46.760\nthread like there were people who delved into that question of like you know\n\n23:46.760 --> 23:50.600\nwanting to know about the gulery of it all if that's a word but and there was\n\n23:50.600 --> 23:54.440\none there was one post in particular it was like all the way like crazy how are\n\n23:54.440 --> 23:58.920\nyou simultaneously like a Tyler Durden the edge lord and anti true crime like\n\n23:58.920 --> 24:05.600\nwhere they were like like ask them how they can stomach being the perpetuators\n\n24:05.600 --> 24:08.920\nof blood whatever it was like it was like somebody that was like really just\n\n24:08.920 --> 24:16.040\nwanted to shame the genre and I don't I don't think it's a righteous genre at\n\n24:16.040 --> 24:20.400\nall I told you guys when we had dinner the other night like like among the many\n\n24:20.400 --> 24:25.640\nlike almost innumerable variables that that I like go to with in my head as a\n\n24:25.640 --> 24:28.640\ntrue crime listener you guys are just sort of at the sweet spot of all of them\n\n24:28.640 --> 24:35.600\nand that especially includes this spectrum between the kind of the gulery\n\n24:35.600 --> 24:42.040\nlike where you're just like actually like into how bad things happen to good\n\n24:42.040 --> 24:46.360\npeople and you're kind of like on the bad things side and then the other end of\n\n24:46.360 --> 24:50.800\nthe spectrum is this this compulsion that a lot of true crime podcasts have\n\n24:50.800 --> 24:54.200\nespecially lately where it's like they you can tell they kind of feel bad about\n\n24:54.200 --> 24:57.320\nwhat they're doing to the point where they they're now kind of contorting their\n\n24:57.320 --> 25:01.200\nlanguage to make it seem like they're a public service like this is about\n\n25:01.200 --> 25:05.200\nremembering the victims and a stuff I'm like yeah that's not a bad thing or\n\n25:05.200 --> 25:09.840\nanything but like really do we do we is it would it be so bad if we were just we\n\n25:09.840 --> 25:14.480\nwere just fascinated with horrible things like in this like unhealthy way\n\n25:14.480 --> 25:18.560\nthat we were kind of fixated on it is that really such a bad thing and do you\n\n25:18.560 --> 25:23.520\nguys ever have conversations about that with yourselves about like what are we\n\n25:23.520 --> 25:29.440\nis this a healthy thing we're doing is this is this unhealthy in a good way is\n\n25:29.440 --> 25:33.680\nit healthy in a bad way like what like where do you put yourselves in relation\n\n25:33.680 --> 25:39.680\nto the the the karma of it all I think that and for me personally I'm just\n\n25:39.680 --> 25:43.760\nfascinated with people and I think that's why true crime is so popular\n\n25:43.760 --> 25:49.360\nbecause I'm always quite wary of people who describe killers as monsters I\n\n25:49.360 --> 25:52.400\nthink that's quite dangerous language because you're separating them from\n\n25:52.400 --> 25:57.000\nyourself but actually you're just as capable as of doing that as that you\n\n25:57.000 --> 26:01.440\nhave all of the same stuff that they do really it's just a separate version of\n\n26:01.440 --> 26:04.240\nevents that have led them to that point and that's what I think is interesting\n\n26:04.240 --> 26:12.680\nyeah but I know what you mean I think like it's important to not victim blame\n\n26:12.680 --> 26:16.440\nand give like name the victims and stuff because I think it's quite easy to just\n\n26:16.440 --> 26:20.240\nlike reel off a list of like a body count and not identify them as people\n\n26:20.240 --> 26:24.520\nyeah for my money I just draw though I don't what I don't like to hear and I've\n\n26:24.520 --> 26:28.640\nnever ever since I was binge watching forensic files before there were true\n\n26:28.640 --> 26:34.640\ncrime podcasts I I know I always hated it when the implication which was an\n\n26:34.640 --> 26:38.160\nimplication that is kind of the bread and butter of those old-school true crime\n\n26:38.160 --> 26:43.120\ntelevision shows the implication that you kind of deserve bad things to happen\n\n26:43.120 --> 26:47.800\nto you if you leave your television set if you go out into the world like like\n\n26:47.800 --> 26:51.760\nwrong place wrong time I've ranted about that like just that that underlying\n\n26:51.760 --> 26:56.400\nreligion of like well you shouldn't have gotten to that trucker's cab like I don't\n\n26:56.400 --> 27:01.200\ncare how like risky the behavior is like no one yeah I just personally for lazy\n\n27:01.200 --> 27:05.200\nselfish reasons I don't want to live in a world where anyone ever deserves\n\n27:05.200 --> 27:09.000\nanything bad to happen to them because I feel like it's bad shit's gonna happen\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:13.120\nto me and people are gonna I just I'm not like the brightest bulb in the drawer\n\n27:13.120 --> 27:19.360\nwhen it comes to like minimizing risk so I like I just it's okay to say that was\n\n27:19.360 --> 27:23.520\nprobably gonna happen because you engage in that high-risk behavior but but to\n\n27:23.520 --> 27:28.960\nthere's some kind of line there where like shows will imply almost that what\n\n27:28.960 --> 27:33.520\ndid you expect and you guys don't do that but at the same time you're very much\n\n27:33.520 --> 27:38.480\nnot you're very funny and profane and almost like so I mean you're you're\n\n27:38.480 --> 27:45.000\nyou're you you make jokes about the the the the victims behavior and one thing\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:48.880\nthat comes to mind like the the girl who disappeared from the cruise ship that\n\n27:48.880 --> 27:55.640\nepisode and you guys just sort of like you're making like jokes about like like\n\n27:55.640 --> 27:59.680\nwho are these people and like the kinds of reactions they're having to their to\n\n27:59.680 --> 28:05.160\ntheir their family member going missing and I remember just being like like this\n\n28:05.160 --> 28:09.360\nskirts the line perfectly for me this is my taste exactly because you weren't\n\n28:09.360 --> 28:12.400\nlike their pieces of shit for having a bad thing happened to them you're just\n\n28:12.400 --> 28:16.800\nsort of questioning their their their judgment in the aftermath like what how\n\n28:16.800 --> 28:19.680\nthe cruise ship is handling it how they're handling it all that stuff like\n\n28:19.680 --> 28:26.480\nit Dan do you have a question no I have a point to that though because I would\n\n28:26.480 --> 28:30.640\nsay that the reason I mean instinctively we wouldn't be the kind of people that\n\n28:30.640 --> 28:34.600\nwould victim blame it just feels grubby and it feels wrong but also we're\n\n28:34.600 --> 28:37.280\ndefinitely well I'm definitely the kind of person that constantly puts myself in\n\n28:37.280 --> 28:44.740\nsituations in which I should probably end up being murdered I do enjoy\n\n28:44.740 --> 28:55.560\nhitchhiking I've done it several times you like your crime because you're going\n\n28:55.560 --> 29:02.840\nto be a topic at some point immerse yourself in the day I get murdered will\n\n29:02.840 --> 29:13.960\nbe your best episode it you really hitchhike still I have hitchhiked like\n\n29:13.960 --> 29:18.360\nlike thumb on the road like standing on the road and not thumb that's a bit old\n\n29:18.360 --> 29:23.880\nschool it's bit cliche it's Venmo now exactly how do you how do you moderate\n\n29:23.880 --> 29:26.800\nhitchhike was not you stand there and then you wait until somebody comes up in\n\n29:26.800 --> 29:34.680\na car and I would say every time that I have hitchhiked I have absolutely\n\n29:34.680 --> 29:40.840\nhad to do it there's been no categorically false this is a runner at\n\n29:40.840 --> 29:45.680\nthe show so Rudy refuses to stop I picked up I picked up I've picked up a\n\n29:45.680 --> 29:48.800\ncouple hitchhikers in my life and where I was certain I was going to be murdered\n\n29:48.800 --> 29:55.080\nby the hitchhiker I got a hitchhiker one time and the guy left my car and he\n\n29:55.080 --> 29:58.760\ngot out of the car and he said thank you and he said to me words I'll never\n\n29:58.760 --> 30:08.200\nforget he said don't take any wooden pussy I don't know what it means but I\n\n30:08.200 --> 30:17.640\nhave lived by that law since 1994 I've never taken any wooden pussy I will say\n\n30:17.640 --> 30:22.200\nthere is a disturbing like undercurrent of like oh I'm preparing for the day\n\n30:22.200 --> 30:25.560\nthat like this is gonna happen to me like we're women we're the prey because\n\n30:25.560 --> 30:32.200\nlike when I went Cody like we're early on in our relationship I think I've like\n\n30:32.200 --> 30:36.080\nlike bullied her out of like expressing it or something because you can see how\n\n30:36.080 --> 30:42.400\nmuch it upsets me like but that the the that that concept of like I'm I'm\n\n30:42.400 --> 30:47.440\nprepared for the day I encounter one of these like monsters like like I'm good\n\n30:47.440 --> 30:51.360\nlike Cody saying like I like and she's confiding in me so nobody judge her\n\n30:51.360 --> 30:55.800\nthis is her talking to her fiance that and not knowing he's gonna like podcast it\n\n30:55.800 --> 31:00.920\nbut like like confiding a feeling like when we're talking about what we get\n\n31:00.920 --> 31:04.960\nout of this genre like Cody confiding was feeling that like one of these days\n\n31:04.960 --> 31:08.920\none of these situations is gonna happen to me and I'm gonna nail it you know and\n\n31:08.920 --> 31:13.320\nI honestly like I mean it makes me angry because I I'm like stop it stop\n\n31:13.320 --> 31:18.840\nsaying that like just like be terrified all the time like don't don't get cocky\n\n31:18.840 --> 31:24.120\nlike I can't like it's the worst feeling in the world is that the thing for\n\n31:24.120 --> 31:30.680\nwomen let that love true crime podcast or in your love of it because like well\n\n31:30.680 --> 31:36.320\nif I walk into an elevator and a guy gets in the elevator with me I'm not I'm\n\n31:36.320 --> 31:41.160\nnot afraid right if I walk through a parking garage like a garage like a\n\n31:41.160 --> 31:45.720\nparking lot and if I hear footsteps behind me I don't think I'm going to get\n\n31:45.720 --> 31:49.960\nraped or murdered but I think that's kind of the neutral setting for all\n\n31:49.960 --> 31:55.280\nwomen right oh yeah it's like a perpetual state of danger right on your\n\n31:55.280 --> 31:59.600\ntoes so you is that part of why you do what you do and what why that's a\n\n31:59.600 --> 32:03.200\nfascination of the murder thing because murder is always an option every time\n\n32:03.200 --> 32:11.000\nyou walk out the door no no for women get killed all the time by their\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:15.840\nboyfriends when they go jogging yeah it's definitely true but then I think like yeah\n\n32:15.840 --> 32:19.560\nI don't know if that is the impetus I feel like all women probably feel that\n\n32:19.560 --> 32:23.080\nway so they'd all be running true crime podcast though you know sometimes it\n\n32:23.080 --> 32:28.200\ndoes feel like everyone is but I think it's more just I've just always been\n\n32:28.200 --> 32:32.480\ninterested in it I'm just the kind of person I like like to go look for what\n\n32:32.480 --> 32:36.720\nis the most disturbing film the most disturbing book like Dan Carlin from\n\n32:36.720 --> 32:40.720\nhardcore history kind of comes back to the idea that people are fascinated by\n\n32:40.720 --> 32:45.160\nthe extremes of the human experiences I think the word he uses it's like that's\n\n32:45.160 --> 32:49.600\nwhy what war is it's like what drives a society to like throw people at other\n\n32:49.600 --> 32:53.520\npeople until like one of them explodes or something you know and so it's like\n\n32:53.520 --> 32:57.200\nthat is like it's so far afield from our normal lives that's it's somehow\n\n32:57.200 --> 33:01.080\nfascinating like you said it's like we all have the same DNA and stuff so it's\n\n33:01.080 --> 33:05.880\nlike what what separates us from these people that live this extreme version and\n\n33:05.880 --> 33:10.320\nand that is fascinating maybe I think so and I think it's always we get feedback\n\n33:10.320 --> 33:15.120\nfrom people saying oh that episode was too gory or too violent but they are\n\n33:15.120 --> 33:19.640\ncategorically our best-performing episodes and some people like I will\n\n33:19.640 --> 33:23.160\nswear on the show like not because we're trying to offend anyone it's just how\n\n33:23.160 --> 33:27.960\nI just how fucking talk right so I think so people will say I just can't I can't\n\n33:27.960 --> 33:31.240\nstand this swearing but I was okay but like listening to a description of a\n\n33:31.240 --> 33:35.160\nbody being cut up you're fine with right it is weird to be what people's\n\n33:35.160 --> 33:42.280\ndealbreakers turn out to be yeah I think it you guys have such like grace and\n\n33:42.280 --> 33:46.440\npoise and maybe that's like maybe 40% of that is just Americans think all\n\n33:46.440 --> 33:50.240\nBritish people have grace and poise but like I'll take it but but I mean it's a\n\n33:50.240 --> 33:55.760\nit's an audio format so the accents are like a huge part of what's for sale I\n\n33:55.760 --> 34:01.520\nlike listening to these voices and but you guys have this sort of confidence to\n\n34:01.520 --> 34:05.600\nyou even though you're dealing with these are really like gray areas especially\n\n34:05.600 --> 34:09.280\nin this time when I feel like I'll just speak for myself like I feel I can't I\n\n34:09.280 --> 34:14.200\nfeel like every time I open my mouth I'm just in a minefield and all I can do is\n\n34:14.200 --> 34:20.360\njust fuck up like as little as possible but so it's kind of nice listening to\n\n34:20.360 --> 34:28.640\nyou guys like you're you're you're you're smart and and and like you're here\n\n34:28.640 --> 34:32.800\nwhen when when the conversation sometimes goes into these areas of like\n\n34:32.800 --> 34:38.040\nabout society about like culture things that could be construed as possibly\n\n34:38.040 --> 34:42.240\npolitics although I think it's a shame that that these things are called\n\n34:42.240 --> 34:46.600\npolitics these days things like the incel when we did when you did the Elliot\n\n34:46.600 --> 34:51.120\nRoger thing I just it was such a beautifully concise like I think it was\n\n34:51.120 --> 34:55.840\nyou Saruti like kind of like ran down just really quickly like what what is an\n\n34:55.840 --> 35:02.200\nincel what is the deal with this and like like it was so it made me feel more\n\n35:02.200 --> 35:10.120\nin control of a of this quagmire just listening to you guys like as eyes in\n\n35:10.120 --> 35:13.660\nlike like talking about it I don't I again I have no questions I'm a bad\n\n35:13.660 --> 35:17.760\ninterview but but but the Reddit people have have have questions I the some of\n\n35:17.760 --> 35:22.200\nwhich actually tickled me oh I but thank you also here's a huge service you\n\n35:22.200 --> 35:29.880\nprovide I urge this is a call to action like everyone has to stop endorsing the\n\n35:29.880 --> 35:33.560\nlie detector like I love that every time there's a lie detector involved in an\n\n35:33.560 --> 35:38.080\ninvestigation guys specifically stop and make a point of how lie detectors are\n\n35:38.080 --> 35:41.600\nhorseshit and that no one should ever consent to a lie detector test like\n\n35:41.600 --> 35:45.800\nwhether you're guilty innocent whatever the larger crime is lie detectors being\n\n35:45.800 --> 35:50.000\ntaken seriously everyone just refused them because they're just like the\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:55.160\nbeat does not that would get a bigger applause that was a weird applause break\n\n35:55.160 --> 36:00.480\nthere I mean I really like it's my it's my big I guess that that in the 911 call\n\n36:00.480 --> 36:04.160\nI guess I do have this like hang up about like what's the 911 call well just\n\n36:04.160 --> 36:08.120\nthat idea of like everyone gets judged for their 911 oh how crazy they sound\n\n36:08.120 --> 36:12.840\nyou know she sounds weird she sounds so robotic she's like a mannequin like she\n\n36:12.840 --> 36:17.840\nmust be guilty like I just live in terror of is like I'm gonna something's gonna\n\n36:17.840 --> 36:21.440\nhappen to Cody and I'm gonna like call 911 and people are gonna listen forever\n\n36:21.440 --> 36:26.920\nto my 911 call he was so calm yeah I have a feeling that it would hold I do\n\n36:26.920 --> 36:30.600\nthink that if something happened to one of you guys I might know where the Dan\n\n36:30.600 --> 36:38.280\nduring his 911 call about Cody he just kept talking about Chevy Chase why why\n\n36:38.280 --> 36:43.080\nwould he do that I don't like I don't like that because just like like because\n\n36:43.080 --> 36:46.880\nyou could say you could justify any narrative and it would make sense because\n\n36:46.880 --> 36:50.400\npeople are fucking crazy and do all sorts of crazy shit so like I don't know\n\n36:50.400 --> 36:53.280\nis it Amanda Knox or whatever she did like flips or whatever and they're like\n\n36:53.280 --> 36:55.640\nthat's what she do she was innocent it's like that's what you do is we're\n\n36:55.640 --> 36:59.200\nguilty it's like yeah both of those are true what I mean what we're just that's\n\n36:59.200 --> 37:03.240\nan idea you had okay that doesn't mean anything yeah dingo baby lady yeah\n\n37:03.240 --> 37:11.520\nexactly dingo baby crying the dark was it no so this lady and her baby got\n\n37:11.520 --> 37:17.680\neaten by a dingo is it crying the dark was the phone call maybe yeah and no one\n\n37:17.680 --> 37:20.280\nbelieved her because she was too sort of stoic yeah and he just kept talking\n\n37:20.280 --> 37:28.280\nabout how dingo's eat me and it was like a dingo my baby yeah exactly and then\n\n37:28.280 --> 37:32.400\nshe went to prison and then they found the baby skeleton in a dingo's nest so\n\n37:32.400 --> 37:37.760\nyeah that's the thing is just because people are just putting weird\n\n37:37.760 --> 37:41.200\nnarratives from their own baggage on someone going through Christ I mean\n\n37:41.200 --> 37:44.760\nthat's why Dan probably feels uncomfortable yeah judgment yeah exactly\n\n37:44.760 --> 37:48.280\nit's particularly judgment about like how you're weird how you talk weird how\n\n37:48.280 --> 37:51.880\nyou act weird let's do it let's do it that someone did suggest to this is in\n\n37:51.880 --> 37:57.120\nthe reddit they said do a 9-1-1 role play exercise and I'm not sure how to do\n\n37:57.120 --> 38:01.040\nit but because the two things are like if you're on night the two things you\n\n38:01.040 --> 38:04.960\nhear on every 9-1-1 caller if the person is like\n\n38:04.960 --> 38:09.880\nneurotypical in their reaction like in other words they're like screaming\n\n38:09.880 --> 38:13.120\nthey're in hysterics oh my god this horrible thing is happening what is\n\n38:13.120 --> 38:16.680\nthe what is the thing that the 9-1-1 operator immediately says I need to\n\n38:16.680 --> 38:21.800\ncalm down yeah ma'am I calm down I need a couple like like it's so like it's so\n\n38:21.800 --> 38:29.120\npredictable and I why does she need to calm down she's screaming here's my\n\n38:29.120 --> 38:34.400\naddress there's a headless body in my driveway it's okay for her to not be\n\n38:34.400 --> 38:38.880\ncalm she's giving you every piece of interest it's also okay for her to be way\n\n38:38.880 --> 38:44.520\ntoo calm because there's a shock factor yeah but then when she does that then\n\n38:44.520 --> 38:51.200\nshe's a suspect like it God forbid that they all right so how do we do yeah I\n\n38:51.200 --> 38:55.160\ndon't know what to what I don't know who's gonna be 9-1-1 Jeff someone should\n\n38:55.160 --> 38:59.640\nbe 9-1-1 and then someone else I think we just go okay let's do it this way\n\n38:59.640 --> 39:04.360\nhmm because it's like why don't we make it like the game of werewolf where we\n\n39:04.360 --> 39:09.840\nsecretly pick one of us is is is a murderer okay and then we'll do a\n\n39:09.840 --> 39:17.280\nseries of 9-1-1 calls and and and and you guys will determine which of us is\n\n39:17.280 --> 39:22.120\nthat sounds great let's do that I think I think Spencer should be the the\n\n39:22.120 --> 39:29.400\ndispatch like the 9-1-1 person okay okay so like like so how do we yeah that's\n\n39:29.400 --> 39:34.720\nwhat I don't we got to figure that part out okay what did Dave find my personal\n\n39:34.720 --> 39:41.120\nplan can you come up here for a moment everybody my personal trainer Dave\n\n39:41.120 --> 39:48.840\nKlein nimble is a mountain goat I ran into him at the drawing room and he\n\n39:48.840 --> 39:58.040\nbecame my trainer that's all day okay so Dave what I'm gonna ask you to do is\n\n39:58.040 --> 40:03.000\njust we're gonna close our eyes and then you're gonna tap one of us on the\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:08.480\nhead and that person will be the murderer so so all four of the me Hannah\n\n40:08.480 --> 40:13.400\nSurici and I we all close our eyes yeah because I don't know how to exclude one\n\n40:13.400 --> 40:19.480\nof you I don't have the heart to do that we're closing our eyes so we don't know\n\n40:19.480 --> 40:24.280\nwho Dave Kline is picking as the murderer no crimes now Dave Kline's gonna\n\n40:24.280 --> 40:30.960\ngonna gonna touch them or somehow indicate to them that they're I'm gonna walk\n\n40:30.960 --> 40:35.520\naround I'm gonna walk around everybody so you can't tell exactly right it's like\n\n40:35.520 --> 40:40.960\nheads up seven yeah all right yeah did people play that game did people play\n\n40:40.960 --> 40:45.560\nfour corners does anyone remember four corners when I moved down here no one\n\n40:45.560 --> 40:48.600\nplayed four corners and then people started playing and then everyone was\n\n40:48.600 --> 40:52.360\nplaying and I was like did I bring four corners down here and make sure you\n\n40:52.360 --> 40:56.320\nexclude Spencer because he's gonna be the dispatch I'm just closing my eyes to\n\n40:56.320 --> 41:01.560\nlike sharing the group yeah that's that's good I might have invented four\n\n41:01.560 --> 41:04.960\nquarters down here though it was a northern California thing there's four\n\n41:04.960 --> 41:10.360\nsquare you got a murderer on your hands oh shit okay I'm opening my eyes okay so\n\n41:10.360 --> 41:14.200\nwe're good we're good to go right now so how do how do we start this oh if you\n\n41:14.200 --> 41:18.720\nwere poked just to be clear if you were poked on the right side of your rib\n\n41:18.720 --> 41:28.920\ncage you're the murderer right all right okay how do we like how do I think\n\n41:28.920 --> 41:33.600\nI who calls who wants to figure this out who wants to go first I think I could\n\n41:33.600 --> 41:36.960\nstart us off if we know who's going first okay well should we get like a\n\n41:36.960 --> 41:40.040\nthumbnail of the murder though so that we're all doing the same so that are\n\n41:40.040 --> 41:46.720\nthe same crime like we just need like like what like a cause of death your\n\n41:46.720 --> 41:54.000\nspouse is is decapitated on the kitchen floor okay it's there and you're\n\n41:54.000 --> 42:00.480\ncalling 911 decapitated spouse so if you murdered them you decapitated them I\n\n42:00.480 --> 42:07.240\nthink eventually the audience I guess I guess not you guys cuz maybe Dave\n\n42:07.240 --> 42:18.360\nKlein can guess because I didn't see well yeah I thought people would like me\n\n42:18.360 --> 42:22.520\nbeing smart thank you for helping us thanks for being nice to me I need it\n\n42:22.520 --> 42:27.120\nactually this is a collaborative effort we are making this up okay all right so\n\n42:27.120 --> 42:34.840\nyeah and the prospect here is that we're gonna try to do the murder is gonna\n\n42:34.840 --> 42:39.360\ntry to sound like a murder doesn't make a lot of sense no it's like they're all\n\n42:39.360 --> 42:43.640\ngonna we're all gonna be lying because we don't have a it's a it doesn't make\n\n42:43.640 --> 42:53.800\nany sense no no it's good hold on hold on hold on let's say a police officer\n\n42:53.800 --> 42:59.320\nfirst we wait it's first I don't like this first week we all make a 9-11 call\n\n42:59.320 --> 43:05.760\na 9-1-1 call yeah or in England isn't it just ollie ollie oxenfree or what\n\n43:05.760 --> 43:12.520\n999 999 999 yeah that's got a result in a lot more false but dials right like I\n\n43:12.520 --> 43:16.640\nthink that's just a bunch of 9-1-1 it goes through to 999 because it's on TV\n\n43:16.640 --> 43:21.160\nso that's nice interesting so first first everybody has to make a call\n\n43:21.160 --> 43:27.000\nsaying that a crime has been committed and they've seen a decapitated lady what\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:32.080\ndon't you get and then then I think Spencer after after you have been\n\n43:32.080 --> 43:36.120\ndispatched here I think you are the lead detective in the like the first 48\n\n43:36.120 --> 43:41.840\nkind of course I mean of course yeah so it's everybody gets sat down and you\n\n43:41.840 --> 43:46.560\nhave to make your first yeah we all get it yeah yeah what don't you get no no\n\n43:46.560 --> 43:52.840\nthe key to this game is you Hannah your your your background is in theater right\n\n43:52.840 -->

just I really can't do door handles hmm a likely story what about\n\n53:31.640 --> 53:41.600\nnobs nobs I can do but I have to do them with my elbows checks out and and\n\n53:41.600 --> 53:47.320\nsorority or whatever your character's name was if it was different talk it\n\n53:47.320 --> 53:54.640\nwasn't stiff stiff upper lip that's that's very suspicious I'm a\n\n53:54.640 --> 54:01.200\nprofessional and I know these things I'll move on well I got an elbow I was\n\n54:01.200 --> 54:04.240\nteaching yoga in Los Feliz baby I got 30 people that can tell you exactly what\n\n54:04.240 --> 54:08.760\nI was doing we can went through a whole sun salutation situation yeah I had what\n\n54:08.760 --> 54:13.000\nthere was a lady let out a real loud juicy fart during Savasana everybody\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:16.120\nremembers it well this is kind of unrelated actually you're just here\n\n54:16.120 --> 54:22.280\nbecause you keep poking people in the side look I got real strict probation\n\n54:22.280 --> 54:26.880\nsituation all right you gotta poke three people every month yeah something like\n\n54:26.880 --> 54:32.880\nthat or it's back in the big time that's right checks out thanks Jeff what the\n\n54:32.880 --> 54:38.240\nfuck I I I don't understand why I'm here I'd like to have a lawyer present\n\n54:38.240 --> 54:41.360\nbefore I answer any question right actually though your friend just got\n\n54:41.360 --> 54:45.960\nkilled by a ghost right we saw we caught a live on film yeah I I run a very\n\n54:45.960 --> 54:51.160\nsuccessful pizza a likely story all right Spencer I'd like to lawyer I think\n\n54:51.160 --> 54:54.600\nit's the murder I'm gonna guess Jeff I think it's probably sorority but that\n\n54:54.600 --> 55:00.520\nseems too obvious well will the real murderer raise their hand well who's\n\n55:00.520 --> 55:05.160\nshe asked the audience what they know well let's ask the audience okay\n\n55:05.160 --> 55:10.040\neverybody on the audience guess on three okay is that cool yeah okay one two\n\n55:10.040 --> 55:20.720\nthree I heard Spencer I did feel they saw they saw you tap me yeah I was the\n\n55:20.720 --> 55:25.360\nmurderer I really thought it was I just if I was ready I'm a master of game\n\n55:25.360 --> 55:32.320\ntheory you guys know about the Monty Hall problem the Monty Hall what I don't\n\n55:32.320 --> 55:36.480\nknow who's enjoying this but someone's gonna love this show here's a good here's\n\n55:36.480 --> 55:42.960\na question I I rather liked from the subreddit little little British talk is\n\n55:42.960 --> 55:47.280\nthat what you're laughing at because I said I rather liked isn't it just isn't\n\n55:47.280 --> 55:51.760\nit just you're just saying because I'm interrupting with continuing my bad\n\n55:51.760 --> 55:58.520\ninterviewing it should be a brother all right come on my goal isn't to be\n\n55:58.520 --> 56:05.760\nBritish in it I like this question I rather liked this question didn't I\n\n56:05.760 --> 56:11.240\njust does anyone think that our generation being obsessed with true\n\n56:11.240 --> 56:15.920\ncrime will create better serial killers it's like we're all doing research on how\n\n56:15.920 --> 56:19.920\nto get away with murder kind of a similar problem with antibiotics right\n\n56:19.920 --> 56:28.600\nwe're gonna make a superbug and I'm not sure whether true crime is a new\n\n56:28.600 --> 56:32.360\nfascination like how how long is America's most want to be on television\n\n56:32.360 --> 56:36.560\nbut don't you think it's safe to say that well I mean that's a dumb leading\n\n56:36.560 --> 56:43.760\nquestion I do do you do do we or do we not think that more people are kind of\n\n56:43.760 --> 56:48.800\nforensically savvy than let's say 20 years ago I think we know what luminol\n\n56:48.800 --> 56:52.920\nis we know so if you're so if you were gonna like fly into a rage and like\n\n56:52.920 --> 56:57.240\nmurder somebody or kill him for insurance like it's safe to say that you are\n\n56:57.240 --> 57:02.400\ngonna maybe take extra steps being a serial killer would be a big step I\n\n57:02.400 --> 57:04.760\ndon't think many people would be serial killers just because they think they\n\n57:04.760 --> 57:11.280\ncould get away with it better right I think they're like the markets it's my\n\n57:11.280 --> 57:15.680\ntime now I'm so well educated in this but I think the average kind of killer\n\n57:15.680 --> 57:19.360\nwho like you know decapitates their spouse and then tries to call in I\n\n57:19.360 --> 57:23.240\nthink they probably are gonna be more sophisticated but then law enforcement\n\n57:23.240 --> 57:27.640\nis constantly getting more sophisticated yeah and I think the pieces that people\n\n57:27.640 --> 57:33.240\nare better at understanding now like luminol or you know DNA and things like\n\n57:33.240 --> 57:36.760\nthat but there's so many different parts to the investigation like when we\n\n57:36.760 --> 57:39.880\ntalked about like Chris Watts the guy who killed his wife and his kids that's\n\n57:39.880 --> 57:44.160\nlike a really recent case the number of unbelievably stupid things he does like\n\n57:44.160 --> 57:48.320\ngoogling things making calls from his phone to like figure out where he can\n\n57:48.320 --> 57:53.280\ndispose of his wife's body I'm like what were you what were you doing thinking\n\n57:53.280 --> 57:56.800\nit just also seems like and I think this is especially true in London right like\n\n57:56.800 --> 58:01.680\nthere's just cameras everywhere like you can't not be a camera I mean the most\n\n58:01.680 --> 58:06.880\ncc's TV'd city in the world yeah yeah it's true I think I don't know if this is\n\n58:06.880 --> 58:12.440\ntrue anymore but at one point certainly I read that your call on cctv about 300\n\n58:12.440 --> 58:16.800\ntimes a day in London right although a lot of places in London they it's\n\n58:16.800 --> 58:20.160\ncheaper just to put a camera out in front of your place and not plug it in\n\n58:20.160 --> 58:24.200\nlike just to look like you have a cctv yeah absolutely that's really common so\n\n58:24.200 --> 58:28.480\nthere's there's loads of blind spots in London and people know exactly where\n\n58:28.480 --> 58:32.360\nthey are and if you're gonna get into a fight or commit a crime then they know\n\n58:32.360 --> 58:36.240\nwhere the cameras aren't plugged in yeah I remember going to like an anarchist\n\n58:36.240 --> 58:40.640\nwebsite probably 20 years ago now where it was like you could you could plug two\n\n58:40.640 --> 58:45.760\nlocations in London into a like a map and it would show you the route where\n\n58:45.760 --> 58:50.520\nyou could stay off camera yeah just for them it was just a matter of principle I\n\n58:50.520 --> 58:59.600\nguess I was at a casino in in Reno Nevada and a guy grabbed a friend of mine\n\n58:59.600 --> 59:06.440\nthis woman like grabbed her by the crotch like Trump style and because he's a\n\n59:06.440 --> 59:13.000\nhorrible human being right and I grabbed the guy and security came over and they\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:16.760\ngo if you want to kick his ass go to the parking lot and go to the right and\n\n59:16.760 --> 59:21.240\nstand by this one thing because the cameras don't work there for a reason\n\n59:21.240 --> 59:24.720\nthat's where the security that's where they go and they fuck people up right\n\n59:24.720 --> 59:28.400\nthey got okay if you're gonna go deal with this guy here's where you here's\n\n59:28.400 --> 59:32.240\nwhere you fucking go that there's cameras but it but those ones don't work\n\n59:32.240 --> 59:36.920\nfor a reason because that's what shit gets dealt with do you think that true\n\n59:36.920 --> 59:41.640\ncrime fans are more or less predisposed to like be wanting to commit crimes though\n\n59:41.640 --> 59:45.240\nbecause I might believe like people with a bent for justice might be more prone\n\n59:45.240 --> 59:49.760\nto do true crimes so then maybe they're less likely to even do these kinds of\n\n59:49.760 --> 59:52.240\ncrimes so then the kinds of people who like this stuff aren't the kinds of\n\n59:52.240 --> 59:55.600\npeople who are gonna use it to get away from crimes I don't know talking\n\n59:55.600 --> 01:00:03.760\ntalking hey guys like like I've read a bunch of like true crime stuff and\n\n01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:09.400\nfictional crime stuff and what the police always say is smart people are\n\n01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:13.520\nthe first ones to get caught hmm because they think that they know what\n\n01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:17.600\nthey're doing well like and they and they also think that they can't get caught\n\n01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:23.280\nand also what because they're smart when presented with evidence and logic\n\n01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:29.320\nthey're they go oh you've got me stupid people get away with it because stupid\n\n01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:33.120\npeople don't see logic and just don't fucking care well did you got well here\n\n01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:38.840\nand and and here's where the the the tween meet did you is this name is Josh\n\n01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:44.240\nPowell is that the the the pow the Powell guy that I think he was Mormon by the\n\n01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:50.280\nway Mormons we got to talk like like like listening to true crime it's like\n\n01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:57.560\nlike yeah I will put a pin in that but the the the Powell guys this is the guy\n\n01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:03.440\nwho drove out to the drove out somewhere came back without his wife in Utah and\n\n01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:11.200\nthen like forever they're investigating him and then he eventually the two\n\n01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.600\nkids he he killed them like and set his house on fire you guys know what I'm\n\n01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:25.160\ntalking about yeah the cold podcast that that guy like he he he had seen a true\n\n01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:29.760\ncrime case like in Utah or something there was some comparable case that he\n\n01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:35.400\nwas documented as having studied basically and the lesson that his not\n\n01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:40.400\nentirely bright mind but incredibly sociopathic mind had learned was simply\n\n01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:48.440\ndon't lie as like like like tell as few lies as possible if you if you're gonna\n\n01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:54.240\ninvent a person for instance that like killed your spouse in the alley don't\n\n01:01:54.240 --> 01:02:00.120\ndon't say you don't you didn't see their face don't say you saw it and that they\n\n01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.640\nwere Latino and they were wearing a fedora like it you're gonna the more\n\n01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.920\ndetails you give the more you're gonna get cornered and caught the guy was just\n\n01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:14.080\nit was like he was like the it was childish the way he like the cops sat him\n\n01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.720\ndown and guzzled there they're just like the cops were almost addicted to shame\n\n01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:21.680\nand the part of the perpetrator where they're like well this is the part where\n\n01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:25.680\nwe corner you and you eventually like just admit that you can't lie anymore\n\n01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:29.960\nbut he just he had like this weird superpower where he was like yeah yeah I\n\n01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.240\nguess I guess you're I guess that does sound crazy and then just silence and\n\n01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:40.240\nthey're like and and he's like and nothing and he kind of any just that he\n\n01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:45.440\nfound the the the it reminded me a lot of Donald Trump's effect on like like the\n\n01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.560\nmedia and things where it was just like we're not we're we don't know how to\n\n01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:53.440\ndeal with this we've never had someone just like would know they're not smart\n\n01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.120\nthey're not stupid they're just he just like went through like he just didn't he\n\n01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.960\njust said as little as possible and then just sat there and he he got away with\n\n01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:07.560\nit until he and then he let him kill himself and his kid anyways like like\n\n01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:11.840\nthat we used to say because there was a that's many people asking that question\n\n01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:15.160\nhow do you how would you how would you get away with murder having studied all\n\n01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.800\nthis stuff the answer used to be have a boat I don't think that's true at all\n\n01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:23.320\nthey're covered with cameras everyone that's the new way to solve a crime have\n\n01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:27.760\na boat it was good before there was cameras everywhere now now the answer is\n\n01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:32.560\njust don't actually like like as long as you can actually get rid of the body\n\n01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:40.560\nlike like don't just say nothing like and let it get used to the feeling of\n\n01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:46.520\neveryone pointing at you and screaming murderer but that just react to that like\n\n01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:51.000\nman and then I'll have a sandwich like and then like our society it doesn't\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.440\nknow what to do with that person right I think in terms of like how to get away\n\n01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:00.880\nwith murder if we're going there and someone not connected you to you in\n\n01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:07.040\nany way that's how you do it and then also what I would do and is if you inject\n\n01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:11.400\nsomeone who's not diabetic with insulin they have a heart attack okay we should\n\n01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:18.600\ncut this out it's very easy to get insulin that's crazy and it's naturally\n\n01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:22.400\noccurring in the human body so they don't test for it hell yeah we're fucking\n\n01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:30.280\nsolving problems on her that's crazy that leads to a question I've always I've\n\n01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.280\nalways kind of had about true crime or a crime in general which is like do we\n\n01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:41.480\nthink that there's a and I don't know if the term should be serial killer or not\n\n01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:47.320\nbut like yeah I guess it should be like do we how do I how do I phrase this\n\n01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:54.920\nquestion is there a is there a fringe of incredibly successful serial killers\n\n01:04:54.920 --> 01:05:06.320\nwho are so like good at what they do that they have body counts in astronomical\n\n01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.480\nnumbers and will never be caught and have never been caught or is it like no\n\n01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.600\nwe just we catch them eventually you know what I mean I don't know how to\n\n01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:19.600\nphrase the question it's sort of like most of the time I think they do realize\n\n01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.000\nthat it's a serial hopefully but I do also think serial murders are the\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.680\nhardest to solve we talk about it's quite a lot on the show because they do do\n\n01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.480\nexactly what Hannah just said they kill people that they don't know there's no\n\n01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:33.760\nconnection and no connection between the victims no connection between them and\n\n01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.240\nthe victim so it's really hard for them to connect the dots and realize and I\n\n01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:42.000\nthink there are definitely serial killers out there with huge huge head\n\n01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.960\ncounts head counts well that's not the body counts especially if they've been\n\n01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:51.000\nkilling people that societies and care about right and if they're really good\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.320\nwe don't know prostitutes die all the time and that's what lots of serial in\n\n01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:59.040\nLA there's like a serial killer that's just been like busting homeless people's\n\n01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:02.240\nheads and then it just kind of like he killed a bunch of people and then\n\n01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.480\nstopped and people were just like yep don't know what happened and like that\n\n01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:12.440\nproud person might be still doing it family that's that's banging down the\n\n01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:17.800\ndoors on the police station saying like follow up on this right nobody cares\n\n01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.160\neven when there is sometimes the thing is if it's like we've talked about cases\n\n01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:25.520\nwhere the victims are sex workers and they're the narrative will be oh well\n\n01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.760\nno one was looking for them or no one was telling the they were there were they\n\n01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.280\nhad you know mothers and fathers and sisters and social workers telling the\n\n01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:36.920\npolice to look but the thing is serial killer investigations are so expensive\n\n01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:42.900\nand it's resourcing and it's about who how much was this person worth to\n\n01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:49.680\nsociety right not a whole lot yeah if she's if she's a blonde rich girl then\n\n01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:53.720\nthen there's more like traction on that and there's also that element of victim\n\n01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.520\nblaming like Dan was talking about the start in terms of well what do you expect\n\n01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:03.600\nyou were you were homeless or you were a sex worker or you were doing this so it\n\n01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:09.000\nwas bound to happen eventually this was inevitable yeah and I think that there's\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.240\ndefinitely an element of that so I think definitely there are serial killers out\n\n01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:16.640\nthere with huge body counts that we haven't tracked down because of who they\n\n01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.880\nwere killing and where they're doing it as well like it's a communication between\n\n01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:23.880\npolice department that's the truck driver thing right like that guy that was\n\n01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:27.840\njust or that guy might still be not caught right like isn't there some\n\n01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:31.720\nAmerican like truck driver guy they think he's a truck driver sure there's\n\n01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:36.240\nloads that just like they're starting to put the thing together like the idea\n\n01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:40.200\nthat this person has just been murdering like what do they call them lot\n\n01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:44.600\nlizards I don't know what the term is for the like the the sex workers that\n\n01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:48.120\nfrequent like truck stops and things like that hitchhikers and things like and\n\n01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:52.480\nthat you just like if you they just study the jurisdictions and they go this\n\n01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.600\nthese investigations will never be yeah they will never be related to in any\n\n01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:01.920\nsingle investigators mine I think of one thing I'd love to add to that those\n\n01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.040\nand more and more now those we talked about it on a couple of episodes with\n\n01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:10.280\nthe DNA stuff now people just giving all of their DNA to these private companies\n\n01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.600\nand then they're put into publicly searchable databases the police can\n\n01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:17.560\nsearch through them and then they caught the Golden State killer last year yeah\n\n01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.280\nI don't know how I feel about that at all it's crazy it's it's absolutely\n\n01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:26.560\nimpossible to have a conversation where your anti-catch a horrible predator you\n\n01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:32.120\ncan't come down against that but it I never predicted that this would happen I\n\n01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.560\nalways predicted that we would have a point as a society where we got to have\n\n01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:39.040\nan increasingly difficult debate right we've never done any of that for any\n\n01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.920\ntechnology we we we I always I remember when they started putting chips in cats\n\n01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:49.040\nyeah like my cat had a microchip in it and I was like where's this going and it\n\n01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.440\nwas it was it was safe to have that because they were like thinking about\n\n01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:55.320\nwell let's do that on prisoners too and that way you wouldn't even need as many\n\n01:08:55.320 --> 01:09:02.280\nbars the chip is the bar like just like but and they always start with house\n\n01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:05.840\npets and prisoners and then our children because we love our children we\n\n01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.640\ndon't anything bad to happen to them and then like civil liberties start\n\n01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:13.920\nincreasingly and and so all of a sudden one day the Golden State killers caught\n\n01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:18.080\nand then it was almost like a footnote that by the way the way he was caught was\n\n01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:22.360\nthis incredibly like way too late to have a debate about it or Wellie and\n\n01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:26.440\nthreshold we've crossed where because we all want to know how much Neanderthal\n\n01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:29.560\nwe have in us we swap our cheeks and send it to these services and then\n\n01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:34.040\nsomewhere along the way everyone just it's like oh holy shit you can just I\n\n01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:39.960\nhow do we feel about that conflicted I think because yeah you have the the\n\n01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:43.160\nsuccess stories of like the Golden State killer and now they're running the DNA\n\n01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.080\nfor like the Zodiac killer and they're like we're gonna get him and all this\n\n01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.520\nand yeah cool but then like the stories that are missed is there are so many\n\n01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.840\narticles about particularly when we were reading about the Golden State killer\n\n01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:58.760\nand we did that case about the 40 year old case the bodies in the barrel the\n\n01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.280\nbear yeah and when we were doing the research for that I read an article\n\n01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.520\nabout a guy who was a high school teacher there had been a couple of rapes\n\n01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:12.920\nin the town that he was living in and he he had his his data his DNA was in the\n\n01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:17.040\ndatabase they said it was him they arrested him they took him in they held\n\n01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:22.160\nhim didn't charge him turns out it was like his nephew or something and by the\n\n01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:26.080\ntime they were able to identify who it really was his life is over he can't be\n\n01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:32.160\na teacher anymore even if he's proven not to be anybody really want him around\n\n01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:35.840\ntheir kids anymore I don't know I mean you can you could you could I mean I\n\n01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:41.560\nthink Trump's gonna win in 2020 on the slogan no collusion oh he's going to win\n\n01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:46.760\nand then I just thought it's kind of I didn't expect that I said I guess we're\n\n01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.480\na little worn out also there was no way that the more report was going to be\n\n01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:54.400\nwhat anybody wanted he's right I just left that idea that it was like that's\n\n01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:57.280\nthe big triumph is it gonna be like remember when you thought I was a\n\n01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:05.600\nRussian agent I wasn't yeah like it's like I like Ike it's just sort of it's\n\n01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:09.840\na little bit more of a negative society when you're doing there I am not a\n\n01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:15.920\ncrook wasn't Nixon's slogan right it was a thing he said while he was being\n\n01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.480\nforced out of society it was a thing he said it was before he was a protest before\n\n01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:26.280\nhe resigned it was an impotent like plaintiff whale you don't have to resign\n\n01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:31.880\nnow you can be a complete asshole and get reelected he's going to be reelected\n\n01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:35.720\nsorry anyway that did remind me of one thing I would never look at this\n\n01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:41.040\npodcast reviews but I did look at yours because I was just curious and you guys\n\n01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:46.240\ngot a flood this fucking pissed me off like I like you guys got a bunch of one\n\n01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:53.720\nstar reviews that were people that your Central Park five episode going like I\n\n01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:57.280\nused to like this podcast but I didn't know it was gonna be about shaming the\n\n01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:04.000\nAmerican president oh yeah he wasn't president when he became famous for\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.840\ntaking out a full he's part of a true crime story right he's part of the\n\n01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.520\nstory like we got I think we got one in the UK as well this guy really all these\n\n01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.600\nbig girls do you talk about Trump all the time this happened 30 years ago why\n\n01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:21.080\nis he being brought he's in the story like what you want me to do it's like a\n\n01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:28.600\nfun knife that stabbed someone then became a senator later it was there it's\n\n01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.000\npart of the story I mean it's not like you guys like take a big break and go\n\n01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.560\nlike by the way here's what we hate about America it was like I just thought\n\n01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.640\nit was so amazing that but there was like yeah there was like like clearly a\n\n01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.000\nbig cluster of people are like one star and particularly for people who are\n\n01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.080\nlike I used to like you and then I found out that you that you don't like it when\n\n01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:52.160\npeople try to kill people with so glad you enjoyed 79 hours of pre-content\n\n01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:58.360\nbefore you yelled at us right yeah one thing yeah but it's fine but I also do\n\n01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.960\nthat I will start listening to show if they say one thing I don't I know it's\n\n01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:05.560\nalmost uplifting that they that someone from that demo couldn't get through all\n\n01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:10.000\nthose episodes because I it's just an it's just an anglophile thing if I hear\n\n01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.120\nan English accent I assume you hate me and I'm not even I'm as liberal as the\n\n01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:18.960\nday is long but I like I'm just like well they would think I was tacky I mean\n\n01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.160\nlisten to them they sound like James Bond I like J.K. Rowling on Twitter is\n\n01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:29.640\nfucking hilarious and someone said like because she like outed like gay\n\n01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:34.240\ncharacters she just recently confirmed that a Dumbledore and Grindelwald had\n\n01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:38.800\nall sorts of crazy nasty sex yeah but like do you guys hear about this yeah\n\n01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.080\nyeah and someone heard they did they cannon didn't in a dumpster behind\n\n01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:50.440\nHogwarts Hogwarts has a dumpster yeah that's what's so weird it's like she's\n\n01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:53.720\ntrying to make all these characters gay but it's like it's getting really thin\n\n01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:58.120\nthese justifications I don't think there was a dumpster she's less into\n\n01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:02.320\nmagic and we're into this PC agenda hot meat sure but a dumpster it's weird\n\n01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:07.040\nsomebody somebody treated her like I I I found out that you're into gay culture\n\n01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:11.880\nand like I took all I have all your movies I took all the CDs out and I'm\n\n01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:17.480\ngonna burn them on my lawn and on the lawn yeah and J.K. Rowling tweeted back\n\n01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:25.200\nsaid that's great because the fumes are toxic and I have your money\n\n01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:32.000\nfuck you can I ask a true crime oh yeah go ahead it's just like okay so I don't\n\n01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.240\ndo true crime a lot but it feels like there might be if you could just\n\n01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.520\nseparate it there's like there's crimes that are kind of solved and there are\n\n01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.720\nthe details and then there's crimes where you don't have all the details do\n\n01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.320\nyou prefer one or the other is both part of it is one more fascinating because I\n\n01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:48.160\ndon't know I was thinking that it's like part of it's like the search for\n\n01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:51.640\ntruth it's like the unknown is there and can I piece it together but there's\n\n01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:55.560\nanother part that's like oh here's all the details and maybe I can own all\n\n01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:58.760\nthese details and use that knowledge which is kind of the opposite of like a\n\n01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.680\nsearch for truth in the void I don't know does that mean anything yeah I think\n\n01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:06.760\nlike in terms of the cases that we do a episode every week possibly misguidedly\n\n01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:12.080\nbut we're here now and so time-wise we've just got to keep turning them out\n\n01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.040\neverything has to be ready to go on Tuesday night and so what we really want\n\n01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:21.920\nto do is do a long-form show about one particular case like a Dr. Death or a\n\n01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:27.280\nhappy face or something like that and where we have the time to like properly\n\n01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:32.680\ninvestigate and get a lot more and a lot more of the details together but\n\n01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:39.160\nprimarily what we're doing on red-handed is storytelling so it's just finding\n\n01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.840\nfinding what we can and piecing together the story right how do you find them\n\n01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:49.880\nlike what's your like your like source for like picking your topic I mean the\n\n01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:55.600\ninternet hell yeah and I mean linked to that question I really enjoy the ones\n\n01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:59.080\nwhere there's not all the details out there and we can piece it together and\n\n01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:04.440\ninterpret it in a different way but I think it just comes down to time yeah\n\n01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:09.480\nwe'll text each other something I'm like I need an easy one this week and by that I mean there's a\n\n01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.360\nwhole shit ton of documentaries out there and there's all this information I\n\n01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:15.760\ncan read it put it together and it's like I said we're not doing an\n\n01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:20.400\ninvestigative podcast we're doing a storytelling one with our opinions in\n\n01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:25.040\nthere so it's just time but the interest is really with the ones where\n\n01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:28.280\nthere's not that much out there right that's what I'm more captivated by\n\n01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.440\nmyself but again I'm not a huge fan so I was wondering yeah all right sorry Dan\n\n01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:35.160\ndo you think the guy from the the staircase do you think that dude that\n\n01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:39.680\nkilled her or his son killed her what do you think about that one what's his\n\n01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:49.320\nname Peterson Peterson yeah Jordan Peterson I don't know I don't know yeah I\n\n01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:52.480\ndon't know either I'm on the fence I'm afraid I actually yeah it's weird because\n\n01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.600\nit's like I remember I was there's an old forensic files where it's just like\n\n01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:00.560\nplain and simple like when I can't even remember now yeah I think they're the\n\n01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.200\nold forensic files it's just like this is a story about a guy who pushed his\n\n01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:06.680\nwife down the stairs and tried to act like he didn't we got him through\n\n01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:10.920\nforensics and that was like the 90s or something and then there was the whole\n\n01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:17.600\ndocumentary and like there's yeah it's I'm whipped back and forth all over the\n\n01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:22.360\nplace every time that story I think he and the son did it I think he and he and\n\n01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:27.800\nthe kid let's do some other classics so that somebody asked in the\n\n01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:33.360\nsubreddit what about Madeline McCann we get this all the time they just they just\n\n01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:36.560\nwant us to talk about Madeline McCann because she's British talk about yeah\n\n01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:41.520\nyeah but I don't know I feel like Madeline McCann was a guy I don't know\n\n01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:48.680\neverybody knows yeah yeah Madeline McCann was a four-year-old girl she was on\n\n01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:52.880\nshe's British she was on holiday with her two parents in Portugal they were\n\n01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:58.040\ndoctors by the way yeah that's an important part of the story and then they are\n\n01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.240\nlike you know having a good time they'd like go have dinner every night in this\n\n01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:05.640\nrestaurant with their friends and leave the kids in the apartment unlocked or\n\n01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:10.160\nunlocked or on their own and then they'd be like it's just like having dinner in\n\n01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:14.120\nthe garden but it's like it's fucking far like it's not like having dinner in\n\n01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:19.560\nyour garden and then one night they go to so they basically do a rotor of one of\n\n01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:23.000\nthe people having tapas going and checking on all the kids every like 15\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.640\nminutes and they go in the room and then Madeline's gone but then her brother\n\n01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:32.360\nand sister asleep in the room too and so really it's either she wandered out and\n\n01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:37.680\nshe fell down a well or something I don't know or she was abducted or the\n\n01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:41.480\nparents killed her and then the whole investigation was did the parents do it\n\n01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.280\nor not because when the mum comes out of the room the first thing she says is\n\n01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:48.360\nthey've taken her I was just gonna say maybe they were involved in some kind of\n\n01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:52.880\nhigh-end dark art like cult thing and they were like give us your favorite one\n\n01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:59.400\nyeah the wait wait why is they've taken her what I just think if you were like\n\n01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.680\nshe was kind of sounds like she was expecting something to happen like who's\n\n01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:07.240\nthere if your kid was missing and you saw when you just be like she had like\n\n01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:11.000\ndetails that she wouldn't have known right it just seems like but this is the\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.160\nclassic thing right yeah like judging someone whose kids just been snatched\n\n01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:21.760\na lot of people have it's like okay so use this as an example so so this is like\n\n01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:27.640\nwhy is this case like extremely like it's a magnet for everybody the reason is\n\n01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:31.880\nbecause there's enough room for speculation that it just in it's a\n\n01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.360\nsandbox for everybody right and then and then there's this other question of\n\n01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:42.800\nokay so it at what point are we you know do we ever think about families of\n\n01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:48.920\nvictims suspects when the stuff is still unsolved no matter how cold the case\n\n01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:54.560\nmay be do we how do we deal with the karma the thought of like these are\n\n01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:57.520\nhuman beings that move on through their life they haven't been convicted they\n\n01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:03.240\nhaven't been in there don't they have a right to like listen to podcasts and\n\n01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:07.800\nlike do we ever do you guys run this through in your head like what if what\n\n01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:13.200\nif so-and-so or their family or whatever is listening yeah I do I worry\n\n01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:18.520\nabout that quite a lot and we just have to be okay with the fact that we feel\n\n01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:24.240\nlike most of the cases we've done we never laugh at the victim we're never\n\n01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:31.200\nmocking the victim so I would hope that they wouldn't ever feel like we were you\n\n01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:37.360\nguys a little hard on the tandem bicycle couple yeah part five thing is a little\n\n01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:43.160\nsnobby yeah where we do where we are snobs two people in love might get on a\n\n01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:46.320\ntandem bike and ride it through Central Park that's true I just have never seen\n\n01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:52.480\nit in the wild it also it also destroyed our scene setting of New York in the\n\n01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:57.480\n80s yeah I did all this work divided city in the rich getting richer and\n\n01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:06.600\nmore getting poor and others that's why they did not deserve to be questioned\n\n01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:11.560\nlike they are anyway sorry we spent the first 15 minutes that episode talking\n\n01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:15.960\nabout the AIDS epidemic the crack epidemic the gang wars and I did a lot\n\n01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:19.040\nof research into the crack epidemic and we talked about it all and then the\n\n01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:23.840\nnext paragraph was and then it was 9 30 p.m. in Central Park in Central Park 5\n\n01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:27.400\nin Central Park and this couple right past on a tandem bike like I probably wrote\n\n01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:34.280\nthat poorly that was probably they they believed the pamphlets I mean they\n\n01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:40.360\nalmost paid with their lives the yeah so like so Madeline McCann like you get\n\n01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:44.480\nwhere are you guys standing it sounds like you're thinking like like now I\n\n01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:48.160\nnow I feel gross because we now we just touched on the topic of what I like like\n\n01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:54.480\nI it feels grody to then go what do you think the parents did it well a lot of\n\n01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:58.000\npeople do think that the parents did it until this new Netflix documentary came\n\n01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.760\nout and I've had a lot of people who were like staunch her parents did it who'd\n\n01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:04.400\nnow changed their minds I haven't watched it yet watching it and I can't\n\n01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.880\ntell if the Netflix documentary is exonerating them if it feels like that\n\n01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:11.200\nbecause it's just incredibly sluggish and they haven't gotten to the point where\n\n01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:15.720\nthey start crucifying the first episode is just you watch the first you can\n\n01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.720\nskip the first episode of that Madeline McCann documentary unless you want to\n\n01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:22.200\nknow lots and lots of unnecessary information about prior delusion the\n\n01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:25.920\n80s like I don't know one of the things where like the parents shook the kid\n\n01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:30.640\nkilled the kid and said oh fuck we just killed our kid now we got the theory is\n\n01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:35.160\nthat they sedated her well not the theory a theory is that they sedated her\n\n01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:39.320\nand then they go off to dinner so they can have a great time and they come back\n\n01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:42.840\nand she's dead oh that's the thing people do that the people drug their kids\n\n01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:47.040\nlike instead of having babies they just dope them up and that's why Hannah said\n\n01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:50.880\nit's important that their doctors I mean God forbid that they're that they're\n\n01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.000\ninnocent and then all of this is being said but it's like the other their\n\n01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.760\noccupation like draws that you're like what if your doctors and you're you know\n\n01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:05.000\nyou you just want your kids to sleep while you go have don't they know that\n\n01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.720\nthat's dangerous I mean you're not I don't think you're supposed to administer\n\n01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:11.160\nsedatives all the time like that well I got I got converted this is the the\n\n01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.840\ninteresting thing about this to me is that the reason the way that we found\n\n01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:21.680\nthe guy that I call Asperger detective I have you if you listen no I just I\n\n01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:26.400\nreally want you to listen to his podcast I'm not saying that you're like him like\n\n01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:34.000\nI hope so like he's like he is just such a like he's so yeah okay it's like he's\n\n01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:40.080\nso what I want to know whether you would love him or hate him I'm excited I he's\n\n01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.600\na very interesting guy what's it called what's the podcast it's it's such a weird\n\n01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:48.960\nforgettable name it's like it's like his that's part of what I love about he's\n\n01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:55.160\nreally not like a marketing guru he's not a person person he owns it he's like\n\n01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:02.280\nhe's like he's not a person person his his reviews are 50% one star 50% five\n\n01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:06.840\nstars are like what the fuck is this guy's problem usually so self\n\n01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:10.080\ncongratulatory and he's sort of like all these things and I'm like I'm like well\n\n01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:14.120\nif you're gonna hate somebody for this stuff then he's my hero and then the\n\n01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.920\nother ones are like he's so deep and thoughtful and interesting because he\n\n01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:23.200\nsorry I'm babbling but but he the from with the reason we found his podcast is\n\n01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:28.000\nbecause Rosanna is that her name Rosanna from the kill killer for near\n\n01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.840\ndreaming who's another favorite of ours she was she was asked she just does\n\n01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:37.360\nCalifornia dreaming she just does California I want to put myself in the\n\n01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:42.240\nballs she's great she's great hearing that she's great like she's not great\n\n01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.640\nit's a terrible she's great well these people aren't like fucking like they\n\n01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:51.040\ndon't go to like graphic design school for their logos they don't go to like how\n\n01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:55.200\nlike branding school like they're they're really into true crime and like some of\n\n01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:01.040\nthe best people have the worst like California dreaming but she focuses on\n\n01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:05.560\nCalifornia and she's truly she's really good and if I kill somebody it's gonna\n\n01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:10.400\nbe someone that calls their podcast California dream interesting thing is I\n\n01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:15.720\nhave a boat she's very thorough and she's very academic and somebody asked her\n\n01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:23.200\nshe's dead I knew it somebody asked her is there any true if she turns up dead\n\n01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:30.800\ntomorrow or missing I did it you're going to jail based on a title yes they get\n\n01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:37.680\nworse oh what yeah no like what's worse than kill a friend okay they don't get\n\n01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:42.800\nworse I love you to come up with a worst name of true crime there's like one\n\n01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.720\nthat's like all Austin true crime and it's called like killers and cattle or\n\n01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:51.560\nsomething I don't know it's I really like like all crime no cattle I can't it's\n\n01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:54.960\nlike it's not really trying to make a Texas thing happen just let me finish\n\n01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:00.920\nmy thought okay I'm just gonna I just realize I'm a murderer and I've told\n\n01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:06.360\nyou all and I'm fine doing the time Rosanna from California dreaming was as\n\n01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:12.360\na Cody told me this that that she was asked is there a case that you changed\n\n01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:17.800\nyour mind on based on an episode of another person's true crime podcast so\n\n01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.360\nthese are really interesting question that I'd like to ask you guys but\n\n01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:29.600\nand she said yes Asperger detectives treat she didn't call him that this guy\n\n01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:34.980\nhis his podcast is called I mean I'm gonna give I'm gonna give him gives his\n\n01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:41.600\ndue signal boost I mean I look I love the guy and same deal buddy I'll fly you\n\n01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:48.680\nout from Los Angeles he lives in LA it's totally affordable I can't I can't\n\n01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:55.800\nremember it's called like cold case it's murder files mold cold case murder\n\n01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:02.000\nmysteries Cody said cold case murder mysteries he's yeah he's this guy and he\n\n01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.360\ntalks like this and he never stops talking like this like you won't I mean\n\n01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:14.000\nlike like look you've been he's polarizing but he is like he he approaches\n\n01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.360\nthe she said yes his treatment of the Madeleine McCain story like it changed\n\n01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:23.640\nher mind and when you listen to it that's that's the episode I would recommend\n\n01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:27.800\nif you want to get into this guy as his Madeleine McCain episode because he just\n\n01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:34.360\nsort of makes it seem incredibly obvious that there was never a plan they what\n\n01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:39.360\nthey they were on vacation they were they were using micro doses of like you\n\n01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:42.680\nknow kind of sedative that they were they're very comfortable with as a\n\n01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.200\nprofessional couple of doctors they were like just keeping the kids there was a\n\n01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:51.560\nthere the kids already on the trip had been actually getting up out of bed and\n\n01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:56.880\nlike you know they they just they crossed a threshold of like let's just\n\n01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:06.240\nNyquilum but on a pro level and and that and that actually like not that they\n\n01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.720\nthey didn't ODM because you're correct they wouldn't do that they would know\n\n01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:17.200\nthe right amount and what actually did happen is that the the kid was high and\n\n01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:24.360\ngot up still and was tooling around the place alone and like was playing on like\n\n01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:30.520\nthe spot where the one of the the dogs did go to when they were investigating one\n\n01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:35.360\nof the corp sniffing dogs like descended on this one area of the the room\n\n01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:41.640\nwhere the Asperger detective I have to stop calling him that case murder\n\n01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:46.560\nmystery says says that that's she probably she maybe like fell off the\n\n01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:50.920\ncouch she was for right it's like like it's just she maybe climbed up on top and\n\n01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:55.680\nlike fell and like the just freak accident total freak accident they they\n\n01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:03.400\nfound out about it and then they kind of like just worked out a thing where they\n\n01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:10.720\nlike and it's actually like that that version of events I I feel bad for the\n\n01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:16.600\nfor the parents if that really happened because they they would be in a they\n\n01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:20.160\nwould be their lives would be fucked they come home to that and that's like\n\n01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:24.240\nit's a tragedy I'm not saying any it's but it's just like imagine that and it's\n\n01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:29.120\nlike oh god the what do any of us do when we're pushed to the point where a lie\n\n01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:33.680\nis equidistant from from the truth in terms of like how much it fucks up your\n\n01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:39.040\nlife where you're like I don't I don't know what I'm made of and if I'm ever\n\n01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.240\nput in a position like that I'm not sure we kind of like we've all been in\n\n01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:47.480\nsituations where like we're gonna lie was just just easier did they find the\n\n01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:52.600\nchild and did they do an autopsy no they've never found a trace of the kid\n\n01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:57.160\nwhich is in its in and of itself it's just incredibly strange I mean how do\n\n01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:00.880\nyou I think that's the thing that makes it feel like it's not the parents\n\n01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:06.040\nbecause if they if they did do it I do think it's like you said Dan like they\n\n01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:10.200\nit was an accident they didn't maliciously murder a bunch of other kids\n\n01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:15.600\nthey're not like we hate kids we want to live a free life exactly and they're in\n\n01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:19.760\na foreign country they don't they're not from Portugal they're on holiday there\n\n01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:23.040\nthey're in like a holiday resort where have they taken this four-year-old's\n\n01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:26.000\nbody that the British police went and helped as well so the Portuguese\n\n01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.920\npolice and the British police are looking for Maddie and they never found her\n\n01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:34.320\nand the parents in a foreign country were able to dispose of this four-year-old's\n\n01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.720\nbody that well that's the thing that doesn't make sense to me it's also just\n\n01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:43.240\nstrange the idea of like a rando that comes in a back door and takes a kid\n\n01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:52.400\nhow do they that that was one of AD's points was like this is a V center\n\n01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:58.000\nAsperger this is a this is a sloppy crime you don't it's isn't like it's not\n\n01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:04.320\nlike specter or like you know whatever the bad guys name you can't say it was\n\n01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:09.520\nlike I must have like this one it wasn't like an it's not an organized thing you\n\n01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:15.440\ngo in and snatch a kid and if they did take them they took them in a it's like\n\n01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:21.120\nthat person doesn't then put the energy and resources into making someone\n\n01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:25.920\nvanish right exactly and I think like snatching a kid like Madeleine McCann\n\n01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:30.440\nis incredibly high-risk like it's the same thing with Amy Bradley like\n\n01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:33.360\nkidnapping someone who's on a cruise ship where there's physically nowhere to\n\n01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:38.320\ngo like why you what is the gain for you that is so huge that makes that worth\n\n01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:43.720\nit in such a high like high-risk high-state you guys think happened to her\n\n01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:52.840\non the cruise ship Amy Bradley do you think she fell overboard I think give\n\n01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:57.720\nme the meat and potatoes of that I don't know you're talking about Amy Bradley\n\n01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:04.240\nAmerican lady I think she was in her early 20s I think I went on a cruise with\n\n01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:10.000\nher family and she disappeared as they were like out to see like round Aruba\n\n01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.560\nand and there's all this stuff they get to Aruba they can't find us she's been\n\n01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.960\nmissing for hours but they're on a ship they're on a ship they're like\n\n01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:20.200\nwell she's clearly here we just don't know where so they did a bit of a half\n\n01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:24.360\nass search anyway they never found her and there was a couple of sightings of\n\n01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:30.880\nher this one guy who's just the worst human being said that he contacted her\n\n01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:34.240\nfamily said I know where I know where she is she's living on a compound with\n\n01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:38.280\nthis man who's got sleeve tattoos and long blonde hair I can extract her for\n\n01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:41.480\nyou so they sent him all of this money and it was all bullshit it wasn't true\n\n01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:45.640\nand so he was just sitting on an island in the Caribbean off their money for\n\n01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:49.560\nmonths at a time anyway so the leading theories are that she was sold into sex\n\n01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:53.080\nslavery there's because it's the Dutch Caribbean where she was so obviously it\n\n01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:59.480\nhas the same laws as the Netherlands for sex work etc and and there's a picture\n\n01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:03.960\nwhich people think is her from years later on like one of these like sex\n\n01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:09.680\nholiday websites but she was extracted off of this cruise ship yeah somehow maybe\n\n01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:13.960\nthat's a theory yeah or she fell overboard but like bodies generally wash\n\n01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:18.760\nup like they weren't that far out to sea it's a it's a it's a nightmare scenario\n\n01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:24.440\nbecause it's like you find out like that these these cruise lines they're they're\n\n01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:31.080\nowned by they're not accountable to the laws that we think they are they're\n\n01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:35.520\nlike they purposely even if they are American corporations they purposely\n\n01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:42.720\nwork through international law because that makes it a lot easier to abuse\n\n01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:46.960\nlabor for instance the guy teaching you shuffleboard can only be paid a penny if\n\n01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:50.600\nyou're not an American you know who this is a case for\n\n01:33:50.600 --> 01:34:02.200\nass broken I will I will okay I mean I guess I'm not surprised we burnt through all our time but I did I like I always\n\n01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:06.560\nlike what do you guys have a I don't know what the word favorite means in this\n\n01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.880\ncontext do you have a favorite case I whatever that means to you and then I'm\n\n01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:16.880\ngonna tell you mine one that we've done on the show or not I have if you're one\n\n01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:20.780\nthat you can't do because you it's too gross because that's another question\n\n01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:23.320\nwhich I think the answer is no too like is there something that's somehow off\n\n01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.800\nlimits are you asking is the one that's unsolved that there's the most\n\n01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:31.600\nfascinating or I leave it to you whatever the word favorite might mean I\n\n01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:38.440\ndon't know like we do have one that we won't ever do Junco oh yeah we'd never\n\n01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:51.640\ndo Junco for a term I don't know what that is it's really really bad I think\n\n01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:54.520\nwe've done a lot of research and come back to your first question of like how\n\n01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:59.680\nmuch does this fuck you up Junco Fruto is the only case that I looked at and\n\n01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:06.320\nread about that I was like in I was in floods of tears after what happened to\n\n01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:11.480\nthat girl is horrifying interestingly though before I forget like what like I\n\n01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:20.160\nthink Jeff did it an astounding thing these girls do a Halloween episode have\n\n01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:23.800\nyou done how many you have a you've only been on for done to okay you've done two\n\n01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:29.720\nHalloween's their Halloween episodes are like they go out of their way to go\n\n01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:35.560\ninto find the worst possible shit even relative to true crime desensitization\n\n01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:39.280\nlike the word it's it really is super effective by the way like I don't know\n\n01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:42.280\nif those are like your more popular episodes because I honestly like I don't\n\n01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:46.440\nI don't go to these things kidding myself like I'm here to be a hero I it's the\n\n01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:51.760\nopposite like I'm I go to true crime to take a break from the pressure of like\n\n01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.200\nthat exists of like oh if I choose right or wrong I'm a good or a bad person and\n\n01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:00.840\nI'm listening to where the pinball machine breaks down like as Spencer\n\n01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:06.240\nalluded to it's like debugging society you're like going okay well this is this\n\n01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:10.720\nyou'll Brenner in Westworld like went nuts and started shooting up the saloon\n\n01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:16.200\nlike I gravitate towards that I want to know details I don't I don't I would\n\n01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.440\nnever bother to go as far as to say it's because I want to prevent it from\n\n01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:23.200\nhappening or it's because I love the people so much or because I think I\n\n01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:27.560\nmight be the guy that did it it's it's all just like rubber-necking it's just\n\n01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:32.720\nsort of like what what went wrong what happened how does this work how it's\n\n01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:42.240\njust I don't know why that we gravitate to that stuff you wait but we we got you\n\n01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:45.600\nsaid you wouldn't do that one guy that's too fucked up right do you have like\n\n01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:52.000\nwhat's yeah do you have a favorite it's a dumb question it makes no sense what's\n\n01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:00.000\nour favorite like murder story it doesn't make my cereal ad-nan you guys\n\n01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.800\nhear about this ad-nan fellow okay I'll tell you look here's my thing I'll talk\n\n01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:12.720\nfor a while I tried I have a family dang it's a platform this is my this is my\n\n01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:18.240\nrequest because I've done I don't remember who did that I think maybe true\n\n01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:24.160\ncrime garage did did did her but I don't hear a lot about her and I continue to\n\n01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:28.680\nbe confounded about what could possibly have happened and why there's not more\n\n01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:35.040\ninvestigation canica Powell I think she lived in Maryland I she's American for\n\n01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:44.200\nsure she if you look it up canica K.A. and I K.A. Powell young lady who her\n\n01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:50.800\napartment like a guy comes to her apartment door knocks on the door and\n\n01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:55.440\nsays he's an FBI agent she's looking through the people the nightmare of this\n\n01:37:55.440 --> 01:38:00.120\nstory the reason people gravitate to it is because she does everything right she\n\n01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:06.840\nnever does anything wrong and it it she looks to the people and the guy says I'm\n\n01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:11.080\nan FBI agent can I come in I want to talk to you about something and she goes\n\n01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:16.360\nhe holds up a badge and she's like she asks him some question I can't remember\n\n01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:21.640\nwas like do you have a badge number or like is there she knows to ask him\n\n01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:26.160\nsomething and he just fucking walks away and it's like the middle of the night\n\n01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:30.320\nand she then goes over to her window and she watches this strange dude who just\n\n01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:34.600\npretended to be an FBI agent walking away from her apartment building and she\n\n01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:40.120\nhears another male voice saying that guy yeah she doesn't see the source of the\n\n01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:44.040\nvoice but she could she she's she's reasonably know this is because she she\n\n01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:49.120\nkeeps records she emails friends and family about these incidents that she\n\n01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:53.720\nhears another voice saying other way or something like that and the guy turns\n\n01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:56.160\naround and walks the other way she doesn't see the source of the voice\n\n01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:59.200\nhe's gonna round the corner one way and then he goes the opposite direction I\n\n01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:02.560\nmean I'm already tears if the story ended there I'm like\n\n01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:11.080\nshe emails there's emails online that's part of what's attractive about the case\n\n01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:16.080\nis that it's just so it's it feels like real life creepypasta because she's we\n\n01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:20.040\nhave your emails that she's sending to her friends and family and I where she's\n\n01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:25.840\nexplaining what happened to her and then five days later another knock at her\n\n01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:34.320\ndoor and a different guy at the door says I have a package for you and she goes\n\n01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:39.240\nwhere is it or something like again she doesn't she doesn't do anything stupid\n\n01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:44.720\nshe reacts exactly the way you're supposed to react and the guy leaves and\n\n01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:50.680\ndoesn't leave a package it's a different guy she is like this is in a span of a\n\n01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:58.040\nweek she works for a laboratory that does work for Homeland Security that's\n\n01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:02.320\npart of also why this is such a freaking freak out because you can't ask the\n\n01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:08.200\ncops can't ask her job anything about who she works with like like is this\n\n01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:12.960\nsomeone and she had one of those jobs that where if you asked her what she\n\n01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:16.560\ndid that day she had to tell you I'm not allowed to tell you now there's lots of\n\n01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:20.000\nthose jobs and they're not all area 51 like level shit but there's just some\n\n01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.560\ncertain jobs where you're not allowed to tell your family what you did that day\n\n01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:27.600\nat work she had one of those jobs and and when the when the homicide\n\n01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:34.560\ninvestigators call her boss you know after she's spoilers dead the they they\n\n01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:39.800\nkeep telling the cops yeah we can't tell you anything about about her job and\n\n01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:46.880\nwho she worked with and anything and the cops are just like okay and so like so\n\n01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:49.920\nthose two incidents happened within five days and I think there was another\n\n01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.880\nknock at her door and she's sending these emails to her mother and her\n\n01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:57.000\nsisters it's heartbreaking she called this police right this yeah she calls the\n\n01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.880\npolice every time and the police come out and they talk to her and they look\n\n01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:03.880\nfor clues and they she calls the FBI because the guy said and the FBI says\n\n01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:08.480\nyeah no that was definitely not an FBI agent we would never do that ever we\n\n01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:12.480\ndon't behave like that we blah blah blah there's like a whole slew of reasons\n\n01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:17.360\nwhy that could not have been us thank you for not opening the door it this poor\n\n01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:25.640\ngirl like she she then emails again like her her family and goes I think she\n\n01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:28.400\nwas gonna take a vacation or something like that and she was like she so she\n\n01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:33.880\nhad some errands to run so she took the day off of work after the last time she\n\n01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:41.360\ntalked to the cops specifically saying like I I don't want to come to leave or\n\n01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:46.120\ncome back to my apartment building at nighttime because I'm a woman and I live\n\n01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:52.240\nalone so I am going to call into work take off of work and like the minute\n\n01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:56.800\nafter she talks to the cops the the third time she goes from there and does\n\n01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:01.720\nher errands and she comes home from her errands and the guy that was the UPS\n\n01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:06.960\npackaged fake guy is in her hallway and shoots her to death and runs away and\n\n01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:13.560\nthat's it no robbery no sexual assault didn't want in her apartment just wanted\n\n01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:18.400\nto kill her fine with
