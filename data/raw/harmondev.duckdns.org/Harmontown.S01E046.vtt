{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:05.000\nHey, Meltdown! How's it going tonight?\n\n00:09.000 --> 00:12.000\nYou seem like an audience that doesn't give a shit about false darts.\n\n00:13.000 --> 00:19.000\nWell, guess what? You've come to a magical place where anything can happen, and I always will.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:36.000\nSo, welcome to the stage for the second time! Dan Harmon! Black Sabbath the Floor! The Double!\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:44.000\nUh, yes, it's a little double-side. We did it from Goldberg, a little satanic Goldberg in the...\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:49.000\nTonight's about being comfortable with chaos.\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:53.000\nI was sitting in the back room and I was thinking, like, I don't have anything.\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:56.000\nI'm going to run out like a dish rag from the Oscars.\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:59.000\nThis will be broadcasting a little bit after it's relevant.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:04.000\nWe don't have to talk about Seth MacFarlane all night, but because then a little air later,\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:06.000\nand people will be like, oh, fresh.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:13.000\nWas it real quick? Because I watched 45 minutes of it, and that was quite enough for me.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:16.000\nWhat is your take away from the Oscars?\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:23.000\nYou know, I didn't look up, I didn't see what the Zeitgeist, or the Gestalt, or the Hormenheimer,\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:28.000\nwas about the whole thing, but I assume, I'm going to go ahead and guess if I was a betting man,\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:35.000\nthat it would be mixed bag, which I think is what Ryan Ridley said this morning when he came in to Rick and Morty.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:39.000\nMixed bag, like, yeah, it seemed like, I mean, in the world of Oscars,\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:43.000\nyou really have to close your eyes and ask yourself, what's the ultimate Oscars,\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:46.000\naside from the one Hugh Jackman hosted that I wrote.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:50.000\nYou wrote the whole Oscars?\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:52.000\nWell, I wrote the opening thing.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:57.000\nYou know what Schrab just told me a couple of days ago, said,\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:00.000\nI never told you this because it was going down during the whole Chevy debacle,\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:03.000\nand I figured I didn't want to put another nickel in you,\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:07.000\nor give you any reason to get any embarrassing public shenanigans,\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:11.000\nand there was this article after the Billy Crystal Oscars,\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:15.000\nwhere some snarky blog, like, printed an article that said,\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:18.000\nhere's the 10 things you have to do to save the Oscars.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:21.000\nNumber one, get rid of Bruce Valanche,\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:28.000\nand bring the guys back that wrote that, Hugh Jackman opening, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:32.000\nNot a hero, the person doing this, I mean, who cares what his opinion is,\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:35.000\nand what are good Oscars, who cares.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:38.000\nBut in the comment section under it, Schrab tells me,\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:40.000\nBruce Valanche signs in,\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:44.000\nand says, according to Schrab,\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:47.000\nso now this is kind of urban legend because I'm quoting Schrab,\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:49.000\nwho's giving me hearsay from this comment section,\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:51.000\nbut something akin to,\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:54.000\nI'm very sorry that you feel I'm past my prime,\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nI did my best, you know, those guys,\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.000\nwe all worked on that opening together,\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:02.000\nand they're the only ones that won the Emmy,\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nbecause they were the ones that were credited for it,\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:08.000\nbut lie, lie, like lie,\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:11.000\n180 degrees from the truth, lie.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:14.000\nNow do people know who Bruce Valanche is in the audience?\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:16.000\nYeah, I think he's kind of famous in the audience.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:18.000\nAre you clapping because you know who he is,\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:20.000\nor clapping because you're fans of Bruce Valanche?\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:22.000\nI think he's the choice.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nClap if you're a big Bruce Valanche fan.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:29.000\nI mean, he's on Hollywood Squares or was at one point,\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:31.000\nhe was drawn in The Simpsons,\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:35.000\nI mean, he's an iconic non-icon, you know?\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:38.000\nLike for 15, 20 years, God knows what,\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\nhe's been writing on the Oscars,\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:42.000\nbut I just thought that was a weird,\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:44.000\nthat's a weird thing because it's like,\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:46.000\nin the world of writing and TV and stuff,\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:49.000\nthere's always room for all kinds of revisionist,\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:52.000\nkind of like, well, you know, Chris McKenna came up with that joke,\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:54.000\nbut really it was my idea, kind of thing,\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.000\nit's like, you forget, you work in collaborative environments,\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nit's like, it's very easy to forget,\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:02.000\nespecially if you're actually really good in collaborative,\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nyou totally forget what you wrote and what someone else wrote.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:11.000\nBut that is not, we walked into the first day of working with that guy,\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:14.000\nwith a finished thing, because it was songs and stuff,\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:16.000\nand there were sets built that Rob made on a cardboard,\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:19.000\nso for him to say that in a comment section,\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:21.000\nI was like, I thought...\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nDan, if you could say one word to Bruce Valanche?\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:24.000\nRight now.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:25.000\nLiar.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:27.000\nLike weird liar.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nIf I get two, I get two?\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:30.000\nWeird liar.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:31.000\nThree?\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:33.000\nLike weird, weird liar.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:36.000\nWeird lying, weird liar.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\nI would build out from there,\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:41.000\nuntil it was a buckyball of just calling him a fucking liar.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:45.000\nLike, just weird, with question marks all over it,\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:48.000\ngoing like, why?\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nI want to know.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:55.000\nIf you're a sociopath, then dress differently.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:58.000\nLike, if you're just an automaton,\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:01.000\nthat's only like this Machiavelli on the ends justifies the means,\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:06.000\nthen why, where did you arrive at Bruce Valanche as a persona?\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:08.000\nLike, how is that effective?\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:11.000\nAnd I just like, honestly, man...\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nWas he cool to work with?\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:14.000\nWas he a good guy?\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:15.000\nNo, no.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:16.000\nNo.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:18.000\nLike, and I'm not, you know, hey look,\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:21.000\nI'm notoriously apparently not cool to work with.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\nI have all kinds of stuff to argue with about that,\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:28.000\nbut I mean, I think that the people that say that I'm hard to work with\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nare themselves hard to work with.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:33.000\nI think that they're just bummed out\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nand they grab for the edge of the pool that's there,\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:37.000\nwhich is like, oh, you know, there's a bunch of people over here\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:41.000\nthat also were made to feel stupid and untalented.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:43.000\nYou know what, he's crazy.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:44.000\nOh, he's crazy? He's crazy.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.000\nHey, everybody's crazy.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nYou know, there's a bunch of really awesome people\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nin the middle of that pool hanging out\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:53.000\nand crushing brews and browing down.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:58.000\nIs that how they talk in the middle of the pool?\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:02.000\nYeah, that's where you have the inflatable bunker,\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nyou know, with the squirt gun mounted in it.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nIt's like, we're having fun out there playing chicken and...\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:07.000\nCrushing brews?\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:08.000\nYeah.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nAnyway, it's just weird, just weird.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:15.000\nI don't know, brews play out somehow if you receive this message somehow.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:18.000\nAnd he will, apparently, because he reads comment sections on...\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:19.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:24.000\nI mean, I think he's a... I put the word image-conscious in giant quotes.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:27.000\nEverybody hashtag Bruce Valanche.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:28.000\nLet's try to...\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:32.000\nI'm inviting you down, Bruce, to explain yourself.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nDefend yourself, sir.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:39.000\nGranted, I will say this in his defense right now preemptively,\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:42.000\nthat I did not read the source material that Rob was referring to.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:47.000\nBut, I mean, and I don't really want to go digging back for conflict, but...\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:48.000\nLet's do it.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:49.000\nLet's do it.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:50.000\nBruce, come down.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:55.000\nBruce, come down and let's talk about your lying liar-ness.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:57.000\nSpeaking of which, did we ever get...\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:02.000\nThere was a chance that Chevy was going to show up on the tour at some point.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:03.000\nHe never did.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:04.000\nYeah, I guess.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nThere's always a chance Chevy will show up.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nBut that was the same as on community.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:09.000\nLike...\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.000\nThat was the whole point.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:20.000\nThere was always a flip of a coin, whether he emerged from the trailer,\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:25.000\nor what his hair would look like, or what would be on his face,\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nand sometimes he'd be happy, and sometimes he'd be sad,\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:29.000\nand sometimes he'd be angry.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nCan we call it right now?\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:34.000\nEvery time we do that stuff, and it's like...\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:38.000\nVulture, HuffPo, TMZ, they extract without context,\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nand it's like, I don't know.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:41.000\nI saw WorldWeary.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:42.000\nI have no reason to be WorldWeary.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nThe world gave me a blowjob.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:48.000\nWas there any fallout, I mean, not fallout,\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:53.000\nor any reaction to when Jason Sudeikis called him as Joe Biden?\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nHe called back.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:55.000\nHe left a message saying,\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:56.000\nWhat was that?\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:57.000\nWas that Danny Pooty?\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:58.000\nWhat was that?\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:01.000\nAnd then I explained to him, I said,\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nNo, that was Jason Sudeikis from SNL,\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:07.000\nand SNL, Saturday Night Live.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:08.000\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:09.000\nI'm kidding.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:10.000\nBut I wouldn't be surprised.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nThat would be to his credit.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:15.000\nSNL, they adopted that sometime during my life.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:16.000\nHe would remember it.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:17.000\nGot KFC.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:18.000\nYeah.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:24.000\nBut he pitched me a TV show idea.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nBut we talked about this.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nI'm WorldWeary, man.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nWhy are you so weary?\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:31.000\nWell, it's Sunday.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nIt's after the Oscars, as we record this,\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nI'm just like, you know...\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:36.000\nYou just hung over?\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:37.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nWe tied one on that night.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:43.000\nWe played catchphrase to like 5 in the morning.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:44.000\nHow'd that go?\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:47.000\nI think I won.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:48.000\nAaron just kept saying,\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nOh, we're playing to 20, we're playing to 30,\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:51.000\nwe're playing to 40.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:52.000\nShe just likes to play.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:56.000\nShe just likes to play until I get mad.\n\n08:56.000 --> 09:01.000\nShe's playing a larger game.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:04.000\nCatch fight.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nShe's catching fights in a little jar.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:09.000\nNo, it's a fun game, but, you know,\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.000\nit's 5 in the morning and, you know...\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nIt's like that game in Indiana Jones\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:15.000\nthat the...\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nWhat's her name is playing with the shot glasses,\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:18.000\nyou know, it's like...\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:19.000\nCatchphrase.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:20.000\nYeah, yeah, catchphrase is like that.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nBecause there's like four people around a table\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nand there's always the first person that's like...\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nthat just stops, you know, their brain stops\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nbeing able to participate in catchphrase.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:32.000\nLike they can't figure out what the things are.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:33.000\nThey just go,\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nOkay, umpire.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:36.000\nThe word is umpire.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.000\nThe other person says, you lose.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:39.000\nIt's a dumb catchphrase story.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nThat's a minute, 11.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nYou won't believe it.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:46.000\nDan tells all.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:52.000\nBruce Willis was right.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nUm, anyways.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nIs Ryan Ridley here in the audience?\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:57.000\nYeah.\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:58.000\nAll right.\n\n09:58.000 --> 09:59.000\nHey, come up here.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:00.000\nCome up here.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:01.000\nOur next guest is Ryan Ridley.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nOh,

story,\n\n11:11.040 --> 11:11.880\nand then-\n\n11:11.880 --> 11:12.720\nAh, okay.\n\n11:12.720 --> 11:15.040\nI was kissing you by a crystal blue Italian stream.\n\n11:15.040 -->

know, we had a little dust up,\n\n11:29.760 --> 11:31.680\nbut other than that, it's pretty good.\n\n11:31.680 --> 11:32.720\nYou had a dust up?\n\n11:32.720 --> 11:33.560\nYeah.\n\n11:33.560 --> 11:34.920\nWell, I went on tour, and I came back,\n\n11:34.920 --> 11:38.880\nand I was saying a couple of outlines,\n\n11:38.880 --> 11:43.520\nneeded more work, and then Ryan, who had kind of like-\n\n11:43.520 --> 11:46.640\nRyan started the Chris McKenna over at Rick and Morty.\n\n11:46.640 --> 11:48.200\nWhat's that mean?\n\n11:48.200 --> 11:50.200\nWell, Chris McKenna was like my right hand,\n\n11:50.200 --> 11:51.840\nthe heart of the show, I would say.\n\n11:51.840 --> 11:53.680\nI wasn't saying that out of neurosis.\n\n11:53.680 --> 11:54.520\nOkay.\n\n11:54.520 --> 11:55.360\nYeah.\n\n11:55.360 --> 12:00.800\nAnd so, you know, he's like,\n\n12:00.800 --> 12:03.320\nChris was the guy that was responsible\n\n12:03.320 --> 12:05.040\nin the absence of responsibility.\n\n12:05.040 --> 12:06.920\nJustin Roiland, who co-created the show with me,\n\n12:06.920 --> 12:09.880\nhe's as crazy as I am in different ways.\n\n12:09.880 --> 12:10.720\nYeah.\n\n12:10.720 --> 12:12.000\nAnd you're the point man,\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:13.800\nyou gotta batten down the hatches.\n\n12:13.800 --> 12:14.880\nI'm the Wonder Bread.\n\n12:14.880 --> 12:15.720\nYeah.\n\n12:15.720 --> 12:16.560\nYou guys are the peanut butter and jelly.\n\n12:16.560 --> 12:18.600\nYou gotta churn out that stuff.\n\n12:18.600 --> 12:21.080\nSo, you put a lot of work into an outline\n\n12:21.080 --> 12:22.960\nwhile I was on the road, and I came back and was like,\n\n12:22.960 --> 12:26.840\nthe outline, you know, I think we need\n\n12:26.840 --> 12:28.160\nto take a step back on this one.\n\n12:28.160 --> 12:31.680\nAnd you went, I wish you would have said that a month ago.\n\n12:31.680 --> 12:34.880\nAnd then you started punching a black baby.\n\n12:34.880 --> 12:36.520\nYeah.\n\n12:36.520 --> 12:38.440\nIs that true, Ryan?\n\n12:38.440 --> 12:39.280\nIs that true?\n\n12:39.280 --> 12:41.240\nI wasn't punching it.\n\n12:41.240 --> 12:42.080\nYeah.\n\n12:42.080 --> 12:44.360\nJust throttling it.\n\n12:44.360 --> 12:46.640\nNot a monster.\n\n12:46.640 --> 12:49.280\nBut yeah, he's spinning it a little in his direction.\n\n12:49.280 --> 12:51.160\nYeah.\n\n12:51.160 --> 12:52.200\nShould I elaborate?\n\n12:52.200 --> 12:54.280\nI don't know.\n\n12:54.280 --> 12:55.640\nIf you want to, I mean, you're the one\n\n12:55.640 --> 12:56.840\nwho brought up the dust up.\n\n12:56.840 --> 12:57.680\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n12:57.680 --> 12:58.960\nI thought that would be something, you know,\n\n12:58.960 --> 13:00.520\nI don't know, that's a good angle, right?\n\n13:00.520 --> 13:02.200\nYeah, I guess.\n\n13:02.200 --> 13:03.200\nAll right, all right, all right.\n\n13:03.200 --> 13:04.040\nDan.\n\n13:04.040 --> 13:05.800\nHey, there's Abed.\n\n13:05.800 --> 13:06.920\nOh, real Abed's here.\n\n13:06.920 --> 13:08.120\nYeah.\n\n13:08.120 --> 13:09.640\nYeah, real Abed's here.\n\n13:09.640 --> 13:11.160\nWe'll get with him in a minute, I think.\n\n13:11.160 --> 13:12.280\nHe'd come up here too.\n\n13:12.280 --> 13:13.120\nYeah, yeah.\n\n13:13.120 --> 13:17.240\nDan, do you respect Ryan as an employee, as a co-worker?\n\n13:17.240 --> 13:18.280\nNot that I care.\n\n13:18.280 --> 13:19.240\nYeah.\n\n13:19.240 --> 13:20.880\nI'm confident enough for myself.\n\n13:20.880 --> 13:23.480\nI did Water in Power, Channel 101's best series\n\n13:23.480 --> 13:26.280\nin the history of Channel 11 with Ryan.\n\n13:26.280 --> 13:27.840\nYeah.\n\n13:27.840 --> 13:30.600\nYou know, we wrote many things together\n\n13:30.600 --> 13:32.040\nin front of an open laptop.\n\n13:32.040 --> 13:34.760\nLike, I don't let a lot of people come around when I'm\n\n13:34.760 --> 13:36.480\nactually typing something on a screen.\n\n13:36.480 --> 13:37.720\nThat's a big thing for me.\n\n13:37.720 --> 13:39.000\nIt's like pooping.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:40.280\nI felt good.\n\n13:40.280 --> 13:41.200\nI felt good to hear that.\n\n13:41.200 --> 13:43.200\nYeah.\n\n13:43.200 --> 13:46.800\nI mean, you're very insecure, very conscious of how other people\n\n13:46.800 --> 13:47.880\nperceive you.\n\n13:47.880 --> 13:50.960\nWell, who here isn't, right?\n\n13:50.960 --> 13:51.460\nAh.\n\n13:54.640 --> 13:58.400\nI think maybe I am the Adam Goldberg, if maybe just\n\n13:58.400 --> 14:00.880\na couple of things different in my life happened.\n\n14:00.880 --> 14:03.840\nAnd, you know, because I was a big fan of Dan's.\n\n14:03.840 --> 14:05.680\nLike, I want to meet Dan and work with Dan.\n\n14:05.680 --> 14:07.600\nAnd, you know, I don't know.\n\n14:07.600 --> 14:08.520\nMakes sense to me.\n\n14:08.520 --> 14:10.320\nYeah.\n\n14:10.320 --> 14:13.480\nRyan Ridley is a legacy comedy personality.\n\n14:13.480 --> 14:19.680\nHis dad, Mark Ridley, founded and runs the Chicago Comedy\n\n14:19.680 --> 14:20.280\nCastle.\n\n14:20.280 --> 14:20.780\nDetroit.\n\n14:20.780 --> 14:21.280\nDetroit.\n\n14:21.280 --> 14:21.780\nYeah.\n\n14:21.780 --> 14:22.280\nYeah.\n\n14:22.280 --> 14:24.960\nYeah.\n\n14:24.960 --> 14:27.600\nMark Ridley's Comedy Castle.\n\n14:27.600 --> 14:30.520\nSo when you were growing up, you would, you know,\n\n14:30.520 --> 14:32.440\nTim Allen would be like, you know.\n\n14:32.440 --> 14:33.680\nIt's a tiger game with him.\n\n14:33.680 --> 14:38.100\nCrashin' on the couch after a, you know, weekend-long\n\n14:38.100 --> 14:45.560\ncoke bender, we had a lot of tools to house.\n\n14:45.560 --> 14:46.200\nYeah.\n\n14:46.200 --> 14:46.440\nYeah.\n\n14:46.440 --> 14:54.240\nLike, like little straws and razor blades, those kind of tools.\n\n14:54.240 --> 14:56.400\nThat's what tool time was back then.\n\n14:56.400 --> 14:59.000\nThere was always a guy peering over something.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:00.480\nHe only saw from your house.\n\n15:00.480 --> 15:05.080\nThere's this dealer, like, hey, what's going on?\n\n15:05.080 --> 15:07.480\nThat's the, that's the inside joke of that, of that gag is\n\n15:07.480 --> 15:09.000\nthat you never see his nose.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:13.200\nIt's his deviated septum, sort of a life of cocaine.\n\n15:13.200 --> 15:14.840\nIt's just a lot running down in front of the fence.\n\n15:14.840 --> 15:19.840\nIt's based on a guy from Detroit named Sniffer.\n\n15:19.840 --> 15:20.640\nUncle Sniffer.\n\n15:20.640 --> 15:23.120\nUncle Sniffer is a coke dealer.\n\n15:23.120 --> 15:24.000\nYeah.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.880\nNo one's uncle, really.\n\n15:26.880 --> 15:34.040\nSo Ryan, your podcast with Justin.\n\n15:34.040 --> 15:35.200\nOh, thank you.\n\n15:35.200 --> 15:35.880\nThank you.\n\n15:35.880 --> 15:37.800\nWhy are they laughing?\n\n15:37.800 --> 15:39.480\nI would actually, I would actually recommend people\n\n15:39.480 --> 15:41.800\nlisten to Ryan's podcast with Justin Roiland, like Rick\n\n15:41.800 --> 15:43.800\nand Morty creator, and sometimes.\n\n15:43.800 --> 15:46.640\nWas that a laugh of recognition because of the podcast?\n\n15:46.640 --> 15:48.920\nGod damn it.\n\n15:48.920 --> 15:51.680\nSomebody, somebody clapped on the back or something.\n\n15:51.680 --> 15:53.040\nAnybody?\n\n15:53.040 --> 15:54.120\nDo I know you?\n\n15:54.120 --> 15:55.040\nAre we friends?\n\n15:55.040 --> 15:58.320\nOh, all right, all right.\n\n15:58.320 --> 16:00.400\nIt's, it's, it's very addictive, a very funny little\n\n16:00.400 --> 16:01.840\npersonalities that you guys have.\n\n16:01.840 --> 16:02.200\nYeah.\n\n16:02.200 --> 16:04.280\nWell, you said you're inspired by it, and that's why you did\n\n16:04.280 --> 16:04.720\nthis podcast.\n\n16:04.720 --> 16:07.400\nYeah, I probably stole the idea, yeah.\n\n16:07.400 --> 16:09.360\nBut yeah, yeah.\n\n16:09.360 --> 16:12.560\nFrom you and seeing Proups at Sketch Fest that first year\n\n16:12.560 --> 16:14.200\nwe went, I think I was like, OK, let's just\n\n16:14.200 --> 16:16.560\nstart podcasting, whatever.\n\n16:16.560 --> 16:18.240\nYou had to throw Proups in, too.\n\n16:18.240 --> 16:21.080\nYou couldn't just gone with us.\n\n16:21.080 --> 16:22.920\nYou said no neurosis.\n\n16:22.920 --> 16:24.000\nI know, Jeff.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:27.040\nIt's hard.\n\n16:27.040 --> 16:28.800\nAll right, so should we, should we, should we bring\n\n16:28.800 --> 16:29.600\nReal Abbot up?\n\n16:29.600 --> 16:30.360\nYeah.\n\n16:30.360 --> 16:31.440\nAll right, Real Abbot.\n\n16:31.440 --> 16:32.720\nHe's never in a rod up before?\n\n16:32.720 --> 16:33.880\nI don't think he's ever been up, no.\n\n16:33.880 --> 16:34.880\nGood Lord.\n\n16:34.880 --> 16:35.880\nWoo!\n\n16:39.360 --> 16:40.480\nReal Abbot.\n\n16:40.480 --> 16:41.880\nIs this like it's nice that I moved down?\n\n16:41.880 --> 16:43.360\nIs this an Abbot game or an Abbot?\n\n16:43.360 --> 16:47.600\nWell, the man who the character Abbot on the community\n\n16:47.600 --> 16:48.880\nwas based upon.\n\n16:48.880 --> 16:49.880\nYou were sitting here, right?\n\n16:49.880 --> 16:53.880\nWait, you, you, you, you, you stand here, buddy.\n\n16:53.880 --> 16:55.880\nYeah, OK.\n\n16:55.880 --> 16:56.880\nHello, buddy.\n\n16:56.880 --> 16:57.880\nHi.\n\n16:57.880 --> 16:58.880\nGreat to be here.\n\n16:58.880 --> 17:00.880\nI, I didn't expect to come on stage, but that's fine.\n\n17:00.880 --> 17:01.880\nIt's all right.\n\n17:01.880 --> 17:03.760\nYou shouldn't have sat in the exact center of the audience.\n\n17:03.760 --> 17:05.760\nThat was, that was kind of an idea.\n\n17:05.760 --> 17:07.760\nI mean, you almost sat like the.\n\n17:07.760 --> 17:08.760\nI was like so worried.\n\n17:08.760 --> 17:10.760\nI was like trying to avoid your gaze.\n\n17:10.760 --> 17:12.760\nAnd I knew in a minute, a minute you looked at me,\n\n17:12.760 --> 17:13.760\nyou would say something.\n\n17:13.760 --> 17:14.760\nAll right.\n\n17:14.760 --> 17:15.760\nSo, uh.\n\n17:15.760 --> 17:16.760\nI feel like I should sit down.\n\n17:16.760 --> 17:17.760\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n17:17.760 --> 17:18.760\nStand.\n\n17:18.760 --> 17:19.760\nIs that a stable?\n\n17:19.760 --> 17:20.760\nNo.\n\n17:20.760 --> 17:21.760\nThat's not stable.\n\n17:21.760 --> 17:22.760\nNo, you can't stop that.\n\n17:22.760 --> 17:23.760\nOK.\n\n17:23.760 --> 17:24.760\nSorry, sorry.\n\n17:24.760 --> 17:25.760\nI just, I, I feel like I'm doing stand-up.\n\n17:25.760 --> 17:26.760\nYeah.\n\n17:26.760 --> 17:28.760\nWell, no, it's like this is a Freudian thing.\n\n17:28.760 --> 17:30.760\nLike he developed this, like, like you face away.\n\n17:30.760 --> 17:32.760\nThat's the development of that couch.\n\n17:32.760 --> 17:34.760\nYou don't look at, look at the audience and listen to us.\n\n17:34.760 --> 17:35.760\nOK.\n\n17:35.760 --> 17:36.760\nWe're going to counsel you.\n\n17:36.760 --> 17:37.760\nStraight ahead, yeah.\n\n17:37.760 --> 17:39.760\nSo, Abed, Abed's name is Abed.\n\n17:39.760 --> 17:41.760\nThat's where I got the idea for the name Abed.\n\n17:41.760 --> 17:47.760\nHe's also a bit of a, I would call you a pop cultural savant kind of.\n\n17:47.760 --> 17:51.760\nBut really, it's more, more, more music for you.\n\n17:51.760 --> 17:52.760\nI think when you.\n\n17:52.760 --> 17:54.760\nNo, actually more like television.\n\n17:54.760 --> 17:55.760\nReally?\n\n17:55.760 --> 17:58.760\nI'm, I'm, I think more in the television and film and music.\n\n17:58.760 --> 18:00.760\nMusic was like something I dabbled in.\n\n18:00.760 --> 18:01.760\nJust like I was bored.\n\n18:01.760 --> 18:03.760\nAnd he knows a ton about it.\n\n18:03.760 --> 18:04.760\nSo that's just dabbling.\n\n18:04.760 --> 18:06.760\nI learned everything and I moved on kind of.\n\n18:06.760 --> 18:08.760\nIt's like, I've heard enough music.\n\n18:08.760 --> 18:11.760\nYou can only take so much music, you know.\n\n18:11.760 --> 18:15.760\nAll right, Abed, Abed, who wrote or who sings this song?\n\n18:15.760 --> 18:16.760\nUh-oh.\n\n18:16.760 --> 18:17.760\nI'll bet it this.\n\n18:21.760 --> 18:22.760\nDon't help him.\n\n18:22.760 --> 18:23.760\nDon't help him.\n\n18:26.760 --> 18:27.760\nI want to say this is.\n\n18:27.760 --> 18:29.760\nIt feels like Led Zeppelin.\n\n18:29.760 --> 18:30.760\nNope.\n\n18:30.760 --> 18:31.760\nDeep purple.\n\n18:31.760 --> 18:32.760\nDeep purple.\n\n18:32.760 --> 18:33.760\nYeah.\n\n18:33.760 --> 18:34.760\nAdam Goldberg got it.\n\n18:34.760 --> 18:35.760\nAdam Goldberg got it.\n\n18:35.760 --> 18:36.760\nI see.\n\n18:36.760 --> 18:38.760\nI was close because of almost famous.\n\n18:38.760 --> 18:39.760\nAren't they both in that movie?\n\n18:39.760 --> 18:40.760\nDon't know.\n\n18:40.760 --> 18:41.760\nYeah.\n\n18:41.760 --> 18:42.760\nClose enough, I think.\n\n18:42.760 --> 18:43.760\nAll right.\n\n18:43.760 --> 18:44.760\nAll right.\n\n18:44.760 --> 18:46.760\nSo by now you're saying real Abed?\n\n18:46.760 --> 18:48.760\nWell, that wasn't fair.\n\n18:48.760 --> 18:50.760\nThat was like so wild card.\n\n18:50.760 --> 18:52.760\nWell, do you want to, that's my next question.\n\n18:52.760 --> 18:55.760\nDo you want, do you want to think about it?\n\n18:55.760 --> 19:00.760\nDo you want, do you want to think, to what extent do you want to think that the character\n\n19:00.760 --> 19:04.760\non community is like congruous with you?\n\n19:04.760 --> 19:09.760\nLike what would make you more outraged, you know, or uncomfortable?\n\n19:09.760 --> 19:13.760\nThe idea that he's nothing like you or the idea that he's exactly like you and therefore\n\n19:13.760 --> 19:15.760\nI have like somehow exploited you.\n\n19:15.760 --> 19:17.760\nYou know, everyone gets exploited though.\n\n19:17.760 --> 19:18.760\nThat's the thing.\n\n19:18.760 --> 19:19.760\nI mean, that's nothing new.\n\n19:19.760 --> 19:20.760\nIt's the American dream.\n\n19:20.760 --> 19:24.760\nYeah, I mean, it's been happening since, and my people were exploited basically.\n\n19:24.760 --> 19:25.760\nThat's fine.\n\n19:25.760 --> 19:26.760\nYeah, by his.\n\n19:26.760 --> 19:27.760\nRight.\n\n19:27.760 --> 19:28.760\nI think we get along so well.\n\n19:28.760 --> 19:30.760\nRyan's half Jewish and Abed's half Palestinian.\n\n19:30.760 --> 19:33.760\nThat's just how it goes with friends.\n\n19:33.760 --> 19:37.760\nBut no, like, I don't, I honestly.\n\n19:37.760 --> 19:42.760\nSo half of you exploited half of him, but half of both of you just sit and eat Twinkies\n\n19:42.760 --> 19:43.760\nand don't care.\n\n19:43.760 --> 19:45.760\nI'm like, half of them is fine.\n\n19:45.760 --> 19:48.760\nThe other half I got a problem with.\n\n19:48.760 --> 19:49.760\nNot really.\n\n19:49.760 --> 19:54.760\nI mean, so yeah, like, like, like, I wrote the part and I really wrote the part with\n\n19:54.760 --> 20:00.760\nthe idea in my head that you would come in and audition for the part, which you did.\n\n20:00.760 --> 20:02.760\nWhich that was an amazing time of my life, by the way.\n\n20:02.760 --> 20:03.760\nYeah, yeah.\n\n20:03.760 --> 20:06.760\nI grew from like, you know, a boy to a close.\n\n20:06.760 --> 20:07.760\nDo you remember who else auditioned?\n\n20:07.760 --> 20:09.760\nLike who made it to the final round?\n\n20:09.760 --> 20:10.760\nIt was Kumail.\n\n20:10.760 --> 20:11.760\nKumail Nanjiani.\n\n20:11.760 --> 20:14.760\nWe were both in the same room and then also, which I knew him, which was crazy because\n\n20:14.760 --> 20:16.760\nI was like, I hope you get it, buddy.\n\n20:16.760 --> 20:17.760\nAnd the guy from 30 Rock.\n\n20:17.760 --> 20:20.760\nYeah, and then Danny Pooty was there too.\n\n20:20.760 --> 20:22.760\nI don't, at the time, didn't know he was Danny Pooty.\n\n20:22.760 --> 20:23.760\nYeah.\n\n20:23.760 --> 20:24.760\nWell, he wasn't Danny Pooty.\n\n20:24.760 --> 20:27.760\nI shook his hand and he was Danny.\n\n20:27.760 --> 20:32.760\nHere's the guy from movietickets.com ad up on that point.\n\n20:32.760 --> 20:33.760\nYeah.\n\n20:33.760 --> 20:35.760\nNo, I remember something now when I was leaving.\n\n20:35.760 --> 20:40.760\nI remember leaving and I think it was when I was kind of doing good and I saw him coming\n\n20:40.760 --> 20:41.760\nout.\n\n20:41.760 --> 20:46.760\nIt was Danny Pooty because I remembered his face and also you said he looked like a peanut\n\n20:46.760 --> 20:47.760\nat one point.\n\n20:47.760 --> 20:49.760\nSorry, but you did.\n\n20:49.760 --> 20:50.760\nYeah.\n\n20:50.760 --> 20:53.760\nAnd then so I was coming out and I won't take it back.\n\n20:53.760 --> 20:54.760\nI saw him on the phone.\n\n20:54.760 --> 20:55.760\nI don't know where this is going.\n\n20:55.760 --> 20:59.760\nI saw him on the phone and he looked like so happy.\n\n20:59.760 --> 21:03.760\nLike he was ecstatic and he was just like, I wasn't that happy.\n\n21:03.760 --> 21:08.760\nAnd so I felt like, yeah, I mean, I guess he's going to get it.\n\n21:08.760 --> 21:09.760\nI mean, everybody kind of nailed it.\n\n21:09.760 --> 21:11.760\nAfter you walked out, everyone was like, holy shit.\n\n21:11.760 --> 21:17.760\nThat guy is like, I can see now where you got the idea for the personality, like some\n\n21:17.760 --> 21:20.760\nof the stuff on paper now makes sense, but they said the same thing after Camille.\n\n21:20.760 --> 21:22.760\nThey said the same thing after, what's this?\n\n21:22.760 --> 21:23.760\nI can't really remember his name.\n\n21:23.760 --> 21:25.760\nThe guy that plays the assistant in 30 Rock.\n\n21:25.760 --> 21:27.760\nLike Johnny Arben or something.\n\n21:27.760 --> 21:28.760\nJohnny Arben.\n\n21:28.760 --> 21:29.760\nThat's got to be it.\n\n21:29.760 --> 21:34.760\nI feel bad now because that guy's going to get mad, right?\n\n21:34.760 --> 21:35.760\nI'm sure, yeah.\n\n21:35.760 --> 21:37.760\nHe was a long time listener and tonight's the night.\n\n21:37.760 --> 21:39.760\nFinally we talked about him and we couldn't get his name.\n\n21:39.760 --> 21:40.760\nOh, no.\n\n21:40.760 --> 21:42.760\nHe's going to beat me up after the show.\n\n21:42.760 --> 21:45.760\nBut, yeah, I mean, but Pooty was just the difference.\n\n21:45.760 --> 21:48.760\nLike all he came in and it was just like, okay, after he walked out, it was like, okay,\n\n21:48.760 --> 21:51.760\nso are we going to have a show with that guy in it or not?\n\n21:51.760 --> 21:54.760\nAnd so it had nothing to do with being right for the character.\n\n21:54.760 --> 21:59.760\nIt was like, like, now let's make the character right for that guy because he's like a superstar.\n\n21:59.760 --> 22:00.760\nWell, that's how I feel.\n\n22:00.760 --> 22:02.760\nI mean, he did these amazing things when he came in.\n\n22:02.760 --> 22:03.760\nNo, but see, I see that.\n\n22:03.760 --> 22:07.760\nI see that I inspired the character, but then you took it into a really cool direction and\n\n22:07.760 --> 22:10.760\nit became its own thing and so Danny brought a lot of himself to it.\n\n22:10.760 --> 22:11.760\nYeah, yeah.\n\n22:11.760 --> 22:12.760\nAnd that's that's how it happened.\n\n22:12.760 --> 22:15.760\nThat's what Abed, they can't fire your creator.\n\n22:15.760 --> 22:18.760\nYou're going to be the same Abed the rest of your life.\n\n22:18.760 --> 22:19.760\nThat's right.\n\n22:19.760 --> 22:20.760\nI'm in it for life.\n\n22:20.760 --> 22:21.760\nI mean, I can't just jump out.\n\n22:21.760 --> 22:27.760\nIn a sense, half of your people are like changing it to a different time slot.\n\n22:27.760 --> 22:28.760\nWe have some notes.\n\n22:28.760 --> 22:29.760\nYeah.\n\n22:29.760 --> 22:30.760\nYeah.\n\n22:30.760 --> 22:33.760\nYou tried to fire his creator.\n\n22:33.760 --> 22:34.760\nClearly.\n\n22:34.760 --> 22:35.760\nYeah.\n\n22:35.760 --> 22:36.760\nCome on.\n\n22:36.760 --> 22:37.760\nAll right.\n\n22:37.760 --> 22:38.760\nI don't want to go there.\n\n22:38.760 --> 22:40.760\nThat's a whole other can.\n\n22:40.760 --> 22:42.760\nThat's a whole other show.\n\n22:42.760 --> 22:45.760\nDo you think Palestine should be a state Abed?\n\n22:45.760 --> 22:47.760\nWell, it is Dan, actually.\n\n22:47.760 --> 22:49.760\nI mean, he calls it Israel.\n\n22:49.760 --> 22:53.760\nI call it Palestine like apples and potatoes and potatoes kind of thing.\n\n22:53.760 --> 22:54.760\nRight.\n\n22:54.760 --> 22:55.760\nLatkes and...\n\n22:55.760 --> 22:56.760\nLatkes and...\n\n22:56.760 --> 22:57.760\nClumps of dirt.\n\n22:57.760 --> 22:58.760\nYeah.\n\n22:58.760 --> 23:00.760\nI don't even know what they have.\n\n23:00.760 --> 23:02.760\nI don't know what they have.\n\n23:02.760 --> 23:03.760\nDo you say latkes?\n\n23:03.760 --> 23:04.760\nI say patakkes.\n\n23:04.760 --> 23:08.760\nThey have some food that's like blah, blah, blah, whatever.\n\n23:08.760 --> 23:09.760\nI can't say it.\n\n23:09.760 --> 23:10.760\nI don't remember.\n\n23:10.760 --> 23:11.760\nI ate it.\n\n23:11.760 --> 23:12.760\nIt was good.\n\n23:12.760 --> 23:13.760\nI don't remember what it was called.\n\n23:13.760 --> 23:14.760\nIt's not called patakkes.\n\n23:14.760 --> 23:15.760\nYeah, patakkes.\n\n23:15.760 --> 23:19.760\nIf Dan had said that, he'd love it.\n\n23:19.760 --> 23:25.760\nAbed, before you go, would you tell everybody your idea for a restaurant?\n\n23:25.760 --> 23:26.760\nOh, no.\n\n23:26.760 --> 23:27.760\nThis again.\n\n23:27.760 --> 23:28.760\nHow many times have we...\n\n23:28.760 --> 23:29.760\nOkay.\n\n23:29.760 --> 23:33.760\nWell, this is like, I came up with this so long ago and it was like, I don't know why.\n\n23:33.760 --> 23:34.760\nBut it was a real idea for a restaurant.\n\n23:34.760 --> 23:35.760\nYeah, it was a real idea.\n\n23:35.760 --> 23:40.760\nAnd for some reason, you attached to it so tenaciously over the years.\n\n23:40.760 --> 23:41.760\nBecause it's insane.\n\n23:41.760 --> 23:42.760\nIt's not insane, though.\n\n23:42.760 --> 23:43.760\nIt's totally...\n\n23:43.760 --> 23:45.760\nIt should happen, basically.\n\n23:45.760 --> 23:46.760\nWell, I'm sure they'll agree.\n\n23:46.760 --> 23:47.760\nJust tell them.\n\n23:47.760 --> 23:48.760\nTell them.\n\n23:48.760 --> 23:49.760\nOkay.\n\n23:49.760 --> 23:50.760\nBecause you forget the specifics.\n\n23:50.760 --> 23:51.760\nLike, would I tell you the story?\n\n23:51.760 --> 23:52.760\nAll right.\n\n23:52.760 --> 23:54.760\nSo, like, you have...\n\n23:54.760 --> 23:58.760\nNow, we all realize that little foods are taking over, right?\n\n23:58.760 --> 23:59.760\nFoods are getting smaller.\n\n23:59.760 --> 24:00.760\nI mean, that's...\n\n24:00.760 --> 24:01.760\nYeah.\n\n24:01.760 --> 24:03.760\nLet's all agree as a premise.\n\n24:03.760 --> 24:07.760\nLet's all agree as a premise before we go any further.\n\n24:07.760 --> 24:09.760\nThe little foods are taking over.\n\n24:09.760 --> 24:12.760\nJust as the Wright brothers had to accept gravity.\n\n24:12.760 --> 24:13.760\nYeah, yeah.\n\n24:13.760 --> 24:15.760\nI mean, I didn't write the rules.\n\n24:15.760 --> 24:16.760\nThere's just fundamental answers.\n\n24:16.760 --> 24:17.760\nWake up, you guys.\n\n24:17.760 --> 24:18.760\nOkay.\n\n24:18.760 --> 24:20.760\nFact number one, little foods are taking over.\n\n24:20.760 --> 24:22.760\nCheck out the idea of large foods for now.\n\n24:22.760 --> 24:23.760\nFor one time in your life.\n\n24:23.760 --> 24:24.760\nI mean, okay.\n\n24:24.760 --> 24:25.760\nYou're in a restaurant.\n\n24:25.760 --> 24:28.760\nYou see a plate of little burgers and a plate of a normal burger.\n\n24:28.760 --> 24:31.760\nI think you'll go to the little burgers.\n\n24:31.760 --> 24:33.760\nFact number two, right?\n\n24:33.760 --> 24:36.760\nYou could have, like, one little burger and be like,\n\n24:36.760 --> 24:38.760\noh, man, I got a taste and I don't feel guilty.\n\n24:38.760 --> 24:39.760\nIt's great.\n\n24:39.760 --> 24:41.760\nThe whole hamburger, if you eat, like, some of it\n\n24:41.760 --> 24:42.760\nand you just put it down, you're like,\n\n24:42.760 --> 24:43.760\nthat guy's wasting food.\n\n24:43.760 --> 24:44.760\nFuck him, you know?\n\n24:44.760 --> 24:46.760\nIt's like, you look and you can't save it for later\n\n24:46.760 --> 24:47.760\nbecause it's weird.\n\n24:47.760 --> 24:48.760\nI don't know.\n\n24:48.760 --> 24:49.760\nSo, anyway...\n\n24:49.760 --> 24:50.760\nI was here, baby.\n\n24:50.760 --> 24:54.760\nI'm like, where can you go to get food that's all small?\n\n24:54.760 --> 24:55.760\nYou know?\n\n24:55.760 --> 24:58.760\nThere's no place.\n\n24:58.760 --> 25:01.760\nYou could go to the Smurfs Village.\n\n25:01.760 --> 25:02.760\nThat doesn't exist, though.\n\n25:02.760 --> 25:04.760\nA tapas restaurant?\n\n25:04.760 --> 25:05.760\nI think we've looked for that.\n\n25:05.760 --> 25:06.760\nWhat?\n\n25:06.760 --> 25:07.760\nTapas.\n\n25:07.760 --> 25:08.760\nA tapas restaurant?\n\n25:08.760 --> 25:10.760\nSpanish have been doing this for centuries.\n\n25:10.760 --> 25:13.760\nOh, so they make small, like, burritos and tacos and stuff?\n\n25:13.760 --> 25:14.760\nThey make little...\n\n25:14.760 --> 25:15.760\nNo, no, no.\n\n25:15.760 --> 25:16.760\nI mean, like...\n\n25:16.760 --> 25:17.760\nNo, no.\n\n25:17.760 --> 25:18.760\nThat's Mexico.\n\n25:18.760 --> 25:19.760\nDescribe your...\n\n25:19.760 --> 25:22.760\nThe Spanish don't make burritos.\n\n25:22.760 --> 25:24.760\nDescribe your restaurant, Abba.\n\n25:24.760 --> 25:25.760\nDescribe your restaurant.\n\n25:25.760 --> 25:26.760\nOh, yeah, right.\n\n25:26.760 --> 25:27.760\nSo the restaurant's called Bytes.\n\n25:27.760 --> 25:28.760\nBytes.\n\n25:28.760 --> 25:31.760\nAnd at the time, I thought it was clever to spell it with a Y.\n\n25:31.760 --> 25:32.760\nRight.\n\n25:32.760 --> 25:34.760\nBecause then everyone would think it was a computer store.\n\n25:34.760 --> 25:36.760\nYeah, the computer age was starting to, like, jump into the...\n\n25:36.760 --> 25:37.760\nwhen I came up with the idea.\n\n25:37.760 --> 25:38.760\nYeah.\n\n25:38.760 --> 25:40.760\nAnd then I was like, this idea...\n\n25:40.760 --> 25:41.760\nOkay, okay.\n\n25:41.760 --> 25:42.760\nYou just go in...\n\n25:42.760 --> 25:45.760\nOkay, let's say I'm with someone, like, a girlfriend.\n\n25:45.760 --> 25:48.760\nIf I had a girlfriend and she's like, oh, my God, I don't want pizza again.\n\n25:48.760 --> 25:49.760\nYou asshole.\n\n25:49.760 --> 25:50.760\nI want burgers.\n\n25:50.760 --> 25:51.760\nAnd you're like, fuck you.\n\n25:51.760 --> 25:52.760\nI want burgers.\n\n25:52.760 --> 25:53.760\nYou know, that happens all the time.\n\n25:53.760 --> 25:56.760\nAnd Bytes, she can have her...\n\n25:56.760 --> 25:59.760\nWhat kind of relationship is this?\n\n25:59.760 --> 26:01.760\nI was generalizing.\n\n26:01.760 --> 26:03.760\nIt sounds like a terrible relationship.\n\n26:03.760 --> 26:04.760\nI'm saying...\n\n26:04.760 --> 26:08.760\nYou're like thinking, fuck you, but you're saying, like, oh, I would like something else.\n\n26:08.760 --> 26:09.760\nOkay.\n\n26:09.760 --> 26:10.760\nAll right.\n\n26:10.760 --> 26:11.760\nThat's your thinking.\n\n26:11.760 --> 26:12.760\nIt's that Louis Armstrong song, right?\n\n26:12.760 --> 26:13.760\nTalk to her nicely.\n\n26:13.760 --> 26:14.760\nOkay.\n\n26:14.760 --> 26:15.760\nTreat her like a lady.\n\n26:15.760 --> 26:16.760\nOkay.\n\n26:16.760 --> 26:17.760\nWell, fuck you, lady.\n\n26:17.760 --> 26:18.760\nOkay.\n\n26:18.760 --> 26:19.760\nFuck you, lady.\n\n26:19.760 --> 26:21.760\nBut, no, I mean, I, you know, okay.\n\n26:21.760 --> 26:23.760\nSo that's the thing is like...\n\n26:23.760 --> 26:24.760\nSo you walk into Bytes.\n\n26:24.760 --> 26:25.760\nYeah.\n\n26:25.760 --> 26:26.760\nAnd the...\n\n26:26.760 --> 26:27.760\nAnd the maitre d is that he sits you?\n\n26:27.760 --> 26:29.760\nWell, he's small too, actually.\n\n26:29.760 --> 26:33.760\nThe whole thing is going to be like, yeah, I have it all for you.\n\n26:33.760 --> 26:34.760\nWait.\n\n26:34.760 --> 26:35.760\nI mean, okay.\n\n26:35.760 --> 26:36.760\nOkay.\n\n26:36.760 --> 26:37.760\nYou guys are all laughing, but...\n\n26:37.760 --> 26:39.760\nYou're just talking about a tiny little village.\n\n26:39.760 --> 26:44.760\nYou guys are laughing, but if he's a little person and you order...\n\n26:44.760 --> 26:45.760\nIt's like...\n\n26:45.760 --> 26:49.760\nHe intensifies the experience because you're like, everything's small, so no.\n\n26:49.760 --> 26:50.760\nNo, no, no.\n\n26:50.760 --> 26:51.760\nThey're giants.\n\n26:51.760 --> 26:52.760\nThey should be giant.\n\n26:52.760 --> 26:56.760\nThey should cast high relief on how small the bite of your food is.\n\n26:56.760 --> 26:59.760\nIf your waiter's tiny, he gives you a tiny piece of pizza.\n\n26:59.760 --> 27:01.760\nIt looks like a real pizza.\n\n27:01.760 --> 27:06.760\nBut that's what's cool because in his world it's like, oh, normal pizza, but then he\n\n27:06.760 --> 27:09.760\ngives it to you and you're like, whoa, small pizza from a small guy.\n\n27:09.760 --> 27:11.760\nIs he like a character when you come in?\n\n27:11.760 --> 27:15.760\nHe says, hey, can I get you some normal sized food?\n\n27:15.760 --> 27:19.760\nAnd there's a sign that says, don't tell him.\n\n27:19.760 --> 27:24.760\nYou should be a co-partner.\n\n27:24.760 --> 27:28.760\nI've invested in worse, I believe.\n\n27:28.760 --> 27:30.760\nI couldn't have thought of that.\n\n27:30.760 --> 27:32.760\nAbed, what is on the menu at Bites?\n\n27:32.760 --> 27:34.760\nTake you through that.\n\n27:34.760 --> 27:36.760\nWhat are the appetizers?\n\n27:36.760 --> 27:37.760\nThe map of the world.\n\n27:37.760 --> 27:39.760\nThe whole thing is appetizers, right?\n\n27:39.760 --> 27:41.760\nYeah, there's every kind of food there.\n\n27:41.760 --> 27:45.760\nSo you come in and you're like, man, I just love kebabs.\n\n27:45.760 --> 27:46.760\nOh, they're so good.\n\n27:46.760 --> 27:49.760\nAnd McDonald's are like, kebab, what?\n\n27:49.760 --> 27:50.760\nWhat the fuck?\n\n27:50.760 --> 27:51.760\nGet out.\n\n27:51.760 --> 27:54.760\nBut you go to Bites and you just go to the section of the map where the Middle East\n\n27:54.760 --> 27:56.760\nis and you got your kebabs right there, baby.\n\n27:56.760 --> 27:59.760\nWhat does a kebab at Bites look like?\n\n27:59.760 --> 28:06.760\nIt's like a tiny, like, Euro or kebab or whatever.\n\n28:06.760 --> 28:07.760\nIt's just miniaturized.\n\n28:07.760 --> 28:10.760\nYeah, it's supposed to be a little poop or something.\n\n28:10.760 --> 28:12.760\nKebabs look like poop.\n\n28:12.760 --> 28:14.760\nAm I the only one that knows that?\n\n28:14.760 --> 28:16.760\nYes, they do.\n\n28:16.760 --> 28:18.760\nNot if you're doing it right.\n\n28:18.760 --> 28:20.760\nI see a kebab and I go giant turd.\n\n28:20.760 --> 28:21.760\nIt's not a food.\n\n28:21.760 --> 28:23.760\nOkay, you want to say little turd.\n\n28:23.760 --> 28:25.760\nWell, yeah, a little turd in here.\n\n28:25.760 --> 28:28.760\nI walk into Bites with my girlfriend, whom I love.\n\n28:28.760 --> 28:29.760\nOkay.\n\n28:29.760 --> 28:32.760\nAnd I walk in there and I say, you know, honey, what are you in the mood for?\n\n28:32.760 --> 28:34.760\nShe goes, I'm in the mood for soup.\n\n28:34.760 --> 28:35.760\nWow.\n\n28:35.760 --> 28:39.760\nI would like a Vietnamese pho.\n\n28:39.760 --> 28:43.760\nThat's so fascinating because he had the same thing back in the day,\n\n28:43.760 --> 28:46.760\nbut his question was like, what about if I want soda?\n\n28:46.760 --> 28:48.760\nDo I get a little drop of soda?\n\n28:48.760 --> 28:50.760\nWhat's the deal with that?\n\n28:50.760 --> 28:53.760\nAnd then I had to say, which I think I was like mentally like,\n\n28:53.760 --> 28:54.760\nfuck, what do I say?\n\n28:54.760 --> 28:55.760\nHe's got me.\n\n28:55.760 --> 28:58.760\nI was like, all right, normal sized soda because let's face it,\n\n28:58.760 --> 29:02.760\nno one's going to be like excited about a drop of soda.\n\n29:02.760 --> 29:06.760\nSo I think with the soup, I'm not excited about midget waiters.\n\n29:06.760 --> 29:10.760\nWell, yeah, that's going to freak me out too.\n\n29:10.760 --> 29:15.760\nOkay. Well, then you guys are there was a guy at the,\n\n29:15.760 --> 29:18.760\nI mean, we're just trying to talk you to your business model here.\n\n29:18.760 --> 29:20.760\nCan I tell you real quick?\n\n29:20.760 --> 29:21.760\nI'm not a businessman.\n\n29:21.760 --> 29:24.760\nI just want to interject when I was like 10 years old for a time,\n\n29:24.760 --> 29:26.760\nmy parents separated and I lived with my mom in South Milwaukee,\n\n29:26.760 --> 29:28.760\nas we called it, South Milwaukee.\n\n29:28.760 --> 29:32.760\nAnd there was a McDonald's there that my grandma always recommended\n\n29:32.760 --> 29:34.760\nbecause it had Billy the brownie.\n\n29:34.760 --> 29:38.760\nAnd I always, I grew up thinking Billy the brownie was a legitimate McDonald's\n\n29:38.760 --> 29:40.760\nland character.\n\n29:40.760 --> 29:43.760\nA little did I know I was going to a South Milwaukee McDonald's\n\n29:43.760 --> 29:47.760\nwhere some like homeless little person dressed up like an elf\n\n29:47.760 --> 29:51.760\nand just hung out at McDonald's and would just talk to children\n\n29:51.760 --> 29:52.760\nand old people.\n\n29:52.760 --> 29:53.760\nThat was his name, Billy Brownie?\n\n29:53.760 --> 29:54.760\nYeah, Billy the brownie.\n\n29:54.760 --> 29:56.760\nLike a walk on character?\n\n29:56.760 --> 29:57.760\nAnd this was the, this was the,\n\n29:57.760 --> 29:59.760\nIt's like from Willow, remember the brownie?\n\n29:59.760 --> 30:00.760\nYeah, yeah.\n\n30:00.760 --> 30:03.760\nThis was the early 80s and I had seen that Donald Sutherland movie\n\n30:03.760 --> 30:04.760\nDon't Look Now.\n\n30:04.760 --> 30:10.760\nLike, yeah, and a deafening silence from our 25 year old peanut gallery.\n\n30:10.760 --> 30:14.760\nLet me tell you, that'll put the midget fear in you in that movie.\n\n30:14.760 --> 30:18.760\nI mean, I can't control your, you know, whatever your psychoses is.\n\n30:18.760 --> 30:20.760\nI mean, well, well, well, well, we're not,\n\n30:20.760 --> 30:24.760\nno, I'm just saying like, that's the one experience I have\n\n30:24.760 --> 30:26.760\nwith being in a restaurant and having a little person be.\n\n30:26.760 --> 30:29.760\nI thought you were attacking the restaurant with that psychoses story.\n\n30:29.760 --> 30:32.760\nI get, well, I think Jeff and I were both suggesting to you that\n\n30:32.760 --> 30:37.760\nwith all due respect to all humanity, like the idea of institutionalized\n\n30:37.760 --> 30:40.760\nlike genetic, it's a eugenic kind of thing you're doing.\n\n30:40.760 --> 30:44.760\nLike you're going like, it's like a doxin that you've bred to work at your restaurant.\n\n30:44.760 --> 30:46.760\nYou're opening a lot of doors for me here,\n\n30:46.760 --> 30:48.760\nbecause now I'm thinking of Oopa Loopa situation.\n\n30:48.760 --> 30:52.760\nI can get, you can find a special kind of little person that exists.\n\n30:52.760 --> 30:54.760\nIt's like hooters for little people.\n\n30:54.760 --> 30:57.760\nThey only exist in one land and their skin is like blue and they're like,\n\n30:57.760 --> 30:58.760\nor not blue.\n\n30:58.760 --> 30:59.760\nWhat about the animals?\n\n30:59.760 --> 31:01.760\nAre you going to breed little animals?\n\n31:01.760 --> 31:05.760\nI feel like community would have a better show with this obed.\n\n31:05.760 --> 31:06.760\nI do, yeah.\n\n31:06.760 --> 31:08.760\nWe've been a way different show, yeah.\n\n31:08.760 --> 31:09.760\nI want to drove them nothing.\n\n31:09.760 --> 31:13.760\nOkay, so now I don't want to bend your mind,\n\n31:13.760 --> 31:15.760\nbut take me into the kitchen at Bites,\n\n31:15.760 --> 31:19.760\nbecause this is where my investment is hesitant,\n\n31:19.760 --> 31:23.760\nbecause I feel like the overhead is maximized in a kitchen where,\n\n31:23.760 --> 31:28.760\nokay, so three tiny pizzas, one half anchovies, one half mushroom,\n\n31:28.760 --> 31:33.760\nand two tiny, tiny tacos, and one tiny chicken shish kebab.\n\n31:33.760 --> 31:35.760\nThey have to...\n\n31:35.760 --> 31:37.760\nYou make a real pizza in the kitchen.\n\n31:37.760 --> 31:38.760\nHere's my pitch.\n\n31:38.760 --> 31:39.760\nYou make a real pizza in the kitchen,\n\n31:39.760 --> 31:42.760\nand then you have a little cookie cutter,\n\n31:42.760 --> 31:45.760\nthe shape like teeth, like a little bite.\n\n31:45.760 --> 31:47.760\nIt looks like somebody already bit out of the pizza.\n\n31:47.760 --> 31:49.760\nThat is awesome.\n\n31:49.760 --> 31:50.760\nWow.\n\n31:50.760 --> 31:53.760\nI'm like, you guys are opening so many new doors here.\n\n31:53.760 --> 31:59.760\nSo you have a bite of a burger that the teeth have already incised the burger,\n\n31:59.760 --> 32:01.760\nand you have that on the side.\n\n32:01.760 --> 32:06.760\nAnd then you put crumbs on the little person's cheek that meets you,\n\n32:06.760 --> 32:09.760\nand let me finish.\n\n32:09.760 --> 32:12.760\nAnd he's the spokesmodel for the restaurant,\n\n32:12.760 --> 32:17.760\nand his catchphrase is, I'm full.\n\n32:17.760 --> 32:21.760\nYou can finish it.\n\n32:21.760 --> 32:23.760\nOver five locations.\n\n32:23.760 --> 32:25.760\nNow on Hollywood and Layton.\n\n32:25.760 --> 32:27.760\nYou can finish it.\n\n32:27.760 --> 32:29.760\nThere's our commercial, man.\n\n32:29.760 --> 32:33.760\nBecause his stomach is extra small.\n\n32:33.760 --> 32:36.760\nWell, that's cool because it's like the Chuck E. Cheese thing.\n\n32:36.760 --> 32:40.760\nEveryone looks like the one thing, the one guy, you know?\n\n32:40.760 --> 32:42.760\nIt's like if I had a ton of Chuck E. Cheese, it's Chuck E. Cheese.\n\n32:42.760 --> 32:43.760\nYeah, yeah.\n\n32:43.760 --> 32:44.760\nIt's like that.\n\n32:44.760 --> 32:46.760\nThey all kind of look the same, oop-a-loop-as things,\n\n32:46.760 --> 32:49.760\nand yeah, and they take bites out of the food,\n\n32:49.760 --> 32:52.760\nbut they don't actually do that.\n\n32:52.760 --> 32:54.760\nAll right, one more thing,\n\n32:54.760 --> 32:56.760\nand then we're going to keep the train moving.\n\n32:56.760 --> 32:58.760\nI wanted to give you that kitchen update.\n\n32:58.760 --> 33:01.760\nWell, I just think, honestly, it's a non-solvent business.\n\n33:01.760 --> 33:03.760\nAnd I don't think you thought it through,\n\n33:03.760 --> 33:07.760\nbecause I think the reason why Mexican restaurants don't bother to go,\n\n33:07.760 --> 33:10.760\noh, fuck it, you can also get a fish sandwich here and plus a pizza,\n\n33:10.760 --> 33:14.760\nis because they would have to then, it wouldn't be worth it for them.\n\n33:14.760 --> 33:16.760\nYou have to kind of focus your menu.\n\n33:16.760 --> 33:18.760\nWell, it's a little cheesecake factory, basically.\n\n33:18.760 --> 33:19.760\nRight.\n\n33:19.760 --> 33:22.760\nWell, you know, I mean, there's 50 things in that menu, right?\n\n33:22.760 --> 33:23.760\nI'm going to compromise though,\n\n33:23.760 --> 33:26.760\nbecause what if now we make a special food land?\n\n33:26.760 --> 33:28.760\nSo you enter food land,\n\n33:28.760 --> 33:30.760\nand there's like every restaurant in food land,\n\n33:30.760 --> 33:32.760\nkind of like the Disney of restaurants,\n\n33:32.760 --> 33:34.760\nbecause my dream was like,\n\n33:34.760 --> 33:37.760\nI wanted people to have whatever they wanted in one place.\n\n33:37.760 --> 33:38.760\nOh, right, right.\n\n33:38.760 --> 33:39.760\nThat was the dream.\n\n33:39.760 --> 33:42.760\nAnd that's what Goldberg says, it's called the food court.\n\n33:42.760 --> 33:44.760\nBut food courts suck,\n\n33:44.760 --> 33:46.760\nand they don't have any good food.\n\n33:46.760 --> 33:47.760\nAnd it's too big.\n\n33:47.760 --> 33:49.760\nYeah, I'm like, what the fuck do I get?\n\n33:49.760 --> 33:52.760\nI'm going to eat a whole bowl of noodles.\n\n33:52.760 --> 33:53.760\nImagine entering.\n\n33:53.760 --> 33:54.760\nWhat am I, a monster?\n\n33:54.760 --> 33:56.760\nImagine a glorious theme park,\n\n33:56.760 --> 33:58.760\nwhere it's like, you know what I mean?\n\n33:58.760 --> 33:59.760\nIt's like you're visiting France.\n\n33:59.760 --> 34:00.760\nYeah.\n\n34:00.760 --> 34:01.760\nBut you're actually eating French, you know what I mean?\n\n34:01.760 --> 34:04.760\nSo you're talking about Epcot Center.\n\n34:04.760 --> 34:07.760\nYou're talking about a miniaturized Lego land Epcot Center.\n\n34:07.760 --> 34:09.760\nYeah, wow.\n\n34:09.760 --> 34:11.760\nYeah, I guess I haven't been there, so,\n\n34:11.760 --> 34:13.760\nthat's probably what it's like.\n\n34:13.760 --> 34:15.760\nAll right, you look a good real abbot.\n\n34:15.760 --> 34:17.760\nLet's have a hand for real abbot.\n\n34:17.760 --> 34:18.760\nThank you.\n\n34:18.760 --> 34:19.760\nThanks everybody.\n\n34:19.760 --> 34:20.760\nThank you.\n\n34:20.760 --> 34:21.760\nYou can...\n\n34:21.760 --> 34:22.760\nCome on.\n\n34:22.760 --> 34:23.760\nCome on.\n\n34:23.760 --> 34:24.760\nCome on.\n\n34:27.760 --> 34:28.760\nMe too.\n\n34:28.760 --> 34:29.760\nIt's nice, I think...\n\n34:29.760 --> 34:32.760\nYeah, I guess why don't you take a hike too, Ridley?\n\n34:32.760 --> 34:34.760\nThank you for coming, Ryan Ridley.\n\n34:34.760 --> 34:37.760\nThat's how you get Ryan Ridley to come to your show.\n\n34:37.760 --> 34:39.760\nYou give him some stage time.\n\n34:41.760 --> 34:44.760\nIt's nice, I think everyone should create TV shows\n\n34:44.760 --> 34:46.760\nwith their friends in them, because then,\n\n34:46.760 --> 34:50.760\nwho is normally just normal abbot, becomes real abbot.\n\n34:50.760 --> 34:52.760\nAnd he was kind of an unreal guy before,\n\n34:52.760 --> 34:55.760\nand now whenever I see him, I go, hey, it's real abbot, man.\n\n34:55.760 --> 34:56.760\nIt's groovy.\n\n34:56.760 --> 34:57.760\nI'm more real to you.\n\n34:57.760 --> 34:58.760\nYeah, exactly.\n\n34:58.760 --> 34:59.760\nIt's nice.\n\n34:59.760 --> 35:00.760\nIt's a nice...\n\n35:00.760 --> 35:03.760\nYou're welcome, abbot, for the favor I did you, but...\n\n35:03.760 --> 35:06.760\nIs there any part of you, Dan, that feels like...\n\n35:06.760 --> 35:10.760\nWhat's your feeling about creating a character based on him?\n\n35:10.760 --> 35:13.760\nWhich version of that is your favorite?\n\n35:13.760 --> 35:14.760\nWell, I mean, I said...\n\n35:14.760 --> 35:15.760\nWhat do you mean?\n\n35:15.760 --> 35:16.760\nOh, do you like...\n\n35:16.760 --> 35:18.760\nWhich abbot do I like more?\n\n35:18.760 --> 35:19.760\nYeah.\n\n35:19.760 --> 35:22.760\nDo you like your creation, or do you like the inspiration?\n\n35:22.760 --> 35:24.760\nNo, come on, of course I like real abbot, he's real.\n\n35:24.760 --> 35:25.760\nOh, good.\n\n35:25.760 --> 35:26.760\nYeah.\n\n35:26.760 --> 35:27.760\nMe too.\n\n35:29.760 --> 35:30.760\nI have everything...\n\n35:30.760 --> 35:32.760\nWe were at a party one time at Rob Schrab's place,\n\n35:32.760 --> 35:33.760\nand...\n\n35:33.760 --> 35:34.760\nAnd...\n\n35:34.760 --> 35:37.760\nAbbot was talking to a person that had passed out.\n\n35:37.760 --> 35:38.760\nOh, god damn it.\n\n35:38.760 --> 35:39.760\nRob...\n\n35:39.760 --> 35:41.760\nThere was a person that had completely fallen asleep,\n\n35:41.760 --> 35:44.760\nand was like, head back...\n\n35:44.760 --> 35:47.760\nAnd abbot, you were breaking it down.\n\n35:47.760 --> 35:48.760\nAnd...\n\n35:48.760 --> 35:50.760\nI didn't know he fell asleep.\n\n35:50.760 --> 35:51.760\nExactly.\n\n35:51.760 --> 35:52.760\nAbbot just called out...\n\n35:52.760 --> 35:54.760\nI didn't know he fell asleep, exactly.\n\n35:54.760 --> 35:57.760\nHe was cutting the silhouette of a person sleeping.\n\n35:57.760 --> 35:58.760\nHe only...\n\n35:58.760 --> 36:02.760\nHe only lacked the disease coming out of his head.\n\n36:02.760 --> 36:05.760\nThe entire party started, so at a certain point we went like,\n\n36:05.760 --> 36:08.760\nlook what's happening over there.\n\n36:08.760 --> 36:10.760\nAnd abbot was just talking...\n\n36:10.760 --> 36:12.760\nThere was music playing, and he was talking to our friend,\n\n36:12.760 --> 36:14.760\nRod, who was full on asleep.\n\n36:14.760 --> 36:16.760\nAnd for real, like, not only...\n\n36:16.760 --> 36:18.760\nThis won't translate to the podcast,\n\n36:18.760 --> 36:20.760\nbut, like, seriously, not only talking to him,\n\n36:20.760 --> 36:22.760\nlike, so I guess you could see, like, you're talking,\n\n36:22.760 --> 36:23.760\nyou're lost in thought, so you just,\n\n36:23.760 --> 36:24.760\nyou don't notice a person listening.\n\n36:24.760 --> 36:27.760\nBut, like, abbot was making these expressions.\n\n36:27.760 --> 36:28.760\nHe was going like...\n\n36:30.760 --> 36:32.760\nLike, he was somehow getting feedback\n\n36:32.760 --> 36:34.760\nfrom our unconscious friend.\n\n36:34.760 --> 36:37.760\nAs Rod slowly slumped...\n\n36:37.760 --> 36:40.760\nLike, before he hit the floor, like...\n\n36:40.760 --> 36:42.760\nLike, his head was like...\n\n36:42.760 --> 36:44.760\nHe looked like he was dead.\n\n36:44.760 --> 36:47.760\nHis head was dangling, and abbot was just talking to him,\n\n36:47.760 --> 36:49.760\nlike, he was on the view or something.\n\n36:49.760 --> 36:50.760\nBut the reason...\n\n36:50.760 --> 36:52.760\nHe was talking about work, I worked with him.\n\n36:52.760 --> 36:54.760\nAnd in boredom, they were talking about work.\n\n36:54.760 --> 36:56.760\nThe beauty of that thing...\n\n36:56.760 --> 36:58.760\nWhat was great about that moment is not that\n\n36:58.760 --> 37:00.760\nthat was funny and hilarious, I mean, it was,\n\n37:00.760 --> 37:03.760\nbut, like, I like the sound of my own voice, too.\n\n37:03.760 --> 37:06.760\nI would love the freedom just to talk to a corpse for a while.\n\n37:06.760 --> 37:09.760\nOr to, yeah, to not care that much?\n\n37:09.760 --> 37:11.760\nLike, I repeat my story,\n\n37:11.760 --> 37:13.760\nso we tell the same stories in Harmontown\n\n37:13.760 --> 37:14.760\na million times over.\n\n37:14.760 --> 37:17.760\nIt'd be great just if you guys were all just mannequins.\n\n37:17.760 --> 37:18.760\nWe could just...\n\n37:18.760 --> 37:20.760\nWe could tell the big Jell-O story again.\n\n37:20.760 --> 37:21.760\nIt'd be great.\n\n37:21.760 --> 37:22.760\nIt's like a superpower.\n\n37:22.760 --> 37:25.760\nLet's keep the people that auditioned\n\n37:25.760 --> 37:27.760\nfor the part of Abaddon community train rolling\n\n37:27.760 --> 37:29.760\nand bring up Kumail Nanjiani.\n\n37:29.760 --> 37:32.760\nYeah.\n\n37:33.760 --> 37:35.760\nIt's a theme tonight.\n\n37:37.760 --> 37:39.760\nI didn't know you auditioned for that.\n\n37:39.760 --> 37:40.760\nHuh?\n\n37:40.760 --> 37:41.760\nI didn't know you auditioned for that.\n\n37:41.760 --> 37:42.760\nYeah.\n\n37:42.760 --> 37:44.760\nI auditioned to be that guy.\n\n37:44.760 --> 37:45.760\nHow'd it go?\n\n37:45.760 --> 37:48.760\nWell, I didn't get it, but I got pretty close.\n\n37:48.760 --> 37:50.760\nOh, yeah, for sure, man.\n\n37:50.760 --> 37:52.760\nI would stay up at night going, fuck, did I?\n\n37:52.760 --> 37:54.760\nI mean, if it weren't for Danny Pudi\n\n37:54.760 --> 37:56.760\nand for real Abaddon sitting in the audience right now,\n\n37:56.760 --> 37:58.760\nI would tell you, like, man, second place.\n\n37:58.760 --> 38:00.760\nI'd never...\n\n38:00.760 --> 38:02.760\nThank you.\n\n38:04.760 --> 38:06.760\nI had never acted at that point, by the way.\n\n38:06.760 --> 38:08.760\nThat was my first...\n\n38:08.760 --> 38:10.760\nWhen I auditioned for that, I had no fucking idea what it was doing.\n\n38:10.760 --> 38:12.760\nAnd you were really nice.\n\n38:12.760 --> 38:14.760\nI'd met you before a little bit and you came out to all of us\n\n38:14.760 --> 38:17.760\nand you were like, you know, it's a really awkward, weird fucking process.\n\n38:17.760 --> 38:18.760\nSorry, we have to go through it.\n\n38:18.760 --> 38:21.760\nYou, like, apologized for the process, which nobody does.\n\n38:21.760 --> 38:22.760\nYeah.\n\n38:22.760 --> 38:24.760\nThat was very hard to work with.\n\n38:24.760 --> 38:26.760\nWell, you gave me the wrong impression that day\n\n38:26.760 --> 38:29.760\nbecause I was like, oh, he's such an easy-going, nice guy.\n\n38:29.760 --> 38:30.760\nIt's weird, it's weird.\n\n38:30.760 --> 38:31.760\nYeah.\n\n38:31.760 --> 38:32.760\nI can't...\n\n38:32.760 --> 38:35.760\nI can't decide if Abad is Adam Goldberg Light\n\n38:35.760 --> 38:37.760\nor if Adam Goldberg is Abad Light.\n\n38:37.760 --> 38:39.760\nI don't know, I don't know.\n\n38:39.760 --> 38:42.760\nLike, there's a whole Rubik's Cube of humanity\n\n38:42.760 --> 38:44.760\nin our McDonald's land.\n\n38:44.760 --> 38:45.760\nIt's crazy.\n\n38:45.760 --> 38:47.760\nI'm gonna open your...\n\n38:47.760 --> 38:49.760\nAdam Goldberg's been playing hard to get.\n\n38:49.760 --> 38:50.760\nLike, that's his new strategy.\n\n38:50.760 --> 38:51.760\nNo, he's not.\n\n38:51.760 --> 38:54.760\nHe retired from being a character at the Egyptian show\n\n38:54.760 --> 38:56.760\nand, like, he's playing it cool.\n\n38:56.760 --> 38:58.760\nHe's reversed psychology.\n\n38:58.760 --> 39:00.760\nHe's the gaming us.\n\n39:00.760 --> 39:01.760\nOh, yeah.\n\n39:01.760 --> 39:04.760\nNext time he wears, like, a huge hat to peacock.\n\n39:04.760 --> 39:05.760\nLike, oh.\n\n39:05.760 --> 39:06.760\nIgnore me.\n\n39:06.760 --> 39:08.760\nI have noticed from Adam's behavior\n\n39:08.760 --> 39:12.760\nthat he's obviously read weird, like, men's guides dedicating\n\n39:12.760 --> 39:15.760\nbecause he does things like he'll give you a gift,\n\n39:15.760 --> 39:17.760\nbut then two weeks later, he'll go,\n\n39:17.760 --> 39:18.760\ncan I have that back?\n\n39:18.760 --> 39:22.760\nAnd it's like, come on, that had to come from some creepy, like,\n\n39:22.760 --> 39:25.760\nFHM guy, like, like, guide to Gettner.\n\n39:25.760 --> 39:28.760\nFHM.com slash approximate human behavior.\n\n39:28.760 --> 39:30.760\nLike...\n\n39:30.760 --> 39:31.760\nYeah.\n\n39:31.760 --> 39:33.760\nSo, uh...\n\n39:33.760 --> 39:35.760\nUh...\n\n39:35.760 --> 39:38.760\nBut now, yeah, and he's just, he's cold-shouldering us.\n\n39:38.760 --> 39:40.760\nI mean, now, he's sitting, he's in the front,\n\n39:40.760 --> 39:41.760\nhe's in the second row.\n\n39:41.760 --> 39:43.760\nHe's the second row now, yeah.\n\n39:43.760 --> 39:44.760\nI shouldn't say cold-shouldering us,\n\n39:44.760 --> 39:45.760\nbecause he's not armed.\n\n39:45.760 --> 39:46.760\nHe's still piping up.\n\n39:46.760 --> 39:47.760\nBut no, look at him.\n\n39:47.760 --> 39:48.760\nHe's got a healthy glow.\n\n39:48.760 --> 39:49.760\nHe's smiling.\n\n39:49.760 --> 39:50.760\nHe's having a good time.\n\n39:50.760 --> 39:52.760\nHe's making us jealous.\n\n39:52.760 --> 39:55.760\nLike, he's showing up at the ex-girlfriend's party\n\n39:55.760 --> 39:57.760\nand being like, hey, what's up?\n\n39:57.760 --> 39:58.760\nHe just lifted up his sweater\n\n39:58.760 --> 40:00.760\nand showed us a Harmontown shirt underneath it.\n\n40:00.760 --> 40:03.760\nLike, there's something terrible is about to happen.\n\n40:03.760 --> 40:04.760\nYou should listen to...\n\n40:04.760 --> 40:08.760\nAnd underneath that shirt is clearly a bomb.\n\n40:08.760 --> 40:12.760\nWhen you listen to his interview on the podcast cast,\n\n40:12.760 --> 40:15.760\nhe gets deeply...\n\n40:15.760 --> 40:19.760\nAaron said she heard it and she was crying\n\n40:19.760 --> 40:21.760\nbecause it gets so personally revelatory.\n\n40:21.760 --> 40:23.760\nI listened to it and I was like, well, that's no.\n\n40:23.760 --> 40:25.760\nIt's like, Adam's like, you know,\n\n40:25.760 --> 40:27.760\nhe's got a lot of my DNA.\n\n40:27.760 --> 40:30.760\nMaybe 50%.\n\n40:30.760 --> 40:32.760\nI'll bet or Adam.\n\n40:32.760 --> 40:34.760\nAdam, right.\n\n40:34.760 --> 40:36.760\nBut he was like, you know,\n\n40:36.760 --> 40:38.760\nhe's got one foot in, one foot out.\n\n40:38.760 --> 40:39.760\nLike, when's he being self-deprecating?\n\n40:39.760 --> 40:40.760\nIs he a narcissist?\n\n40:40.760 --> 40:41.760\nDoes he hate himself?\n\n40:41.760 --> 40:42.760\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\n40:42.760 --> 40:45.760\nHe's telling the story of how Adam's a dungeon master.\n\n40:45.760 --> 40:48.760\nLike, Adam's origin story,\n\n40:48.760 --> 40:50.760\nwhen you peel back the comic book characters,\n\n40:50.760 --> 40:53.760\nlares the night that Spencer came,\n\n40:53.760 --> 40:54.760\nthat fateful night,\n\n40:54.760 --> 40:56.760\nand Spencer raised his hand when we said,\n\n40:56.760 --> 40:57.760\nis there a dungeon master here?\n\n40:57.760 --> 40:59.760\nAdam's a dungeon master.\n\n40:59.760 --> 41:01.760\nAnd Adam wasn't here that night.\n\n41:01.760 --> 41:03.760\nThere's always a Spencer.\n\n41:03.760 --> 41:04.760\nFor real?\n\n41:04.760 --> 41:07.760\nAnd he has had to live with the agony\n\n41:07.760 --> 41:09.760\nof some hypothetical alternate timeline,\n\n41:09.760 --> 41:12.760\nwhere he is Spencer ever since.\n\n41:12.760 --> 41:15.760\nThe Spencer of the Opera.\n\n41:15.760 --> 41:20.760\nWhich includes him coming on tour with us.\n\n41:20.760 --> 41:22.760\nThe poster has his face on it.\n\n41:22.760 --> 41:24.760\nAdam, you're a dungeon master?\n\n41:24.760 --> 41:26.760\nWell, I have a story about it,\n\n41:26.760 --> 41:28.760\nbut I'm playing hard to get, so I don't know.\n\n41:28.760 --> 41:30.760\nThat's not how you do it.\n\n41:30.760 --> 41:32.760\nYou can't say...\n\n41:32.760 --> 41:35.760\nYou can't reveal your strategy.\n\n41:35.760 --> 41:36.760\nThat kills it.\n\n41:36.760 --> 41:38.760\nThat should be rule number one.\n\n41:38.760 --> 41:40.760\nDon't tell anyone you read this article.\n\n41:40.760 --> 41:42.760\nStep two.\n\n41:42.760 --> 41:45.760\nBecause Camille, you played hard to get for a year and a half.\n\n41:45.760 --> 41:47.760\nWe had to ask you to come up on stage.\n\n41:47.760 --> 41:48.760\nNo, I didn't play hard to get.\n\n41:48.760 --> 41:52.760\nI came because my wife started off producing the show.\n\n41:52.760 --> 41:53.760\nHer idea.\n\n41:53.760 --> 41:54.760\nYeah, it was her idea.\n\n41:54.760 --> 41:56.760\nDan Harmon used to do a podcast.\n\n41:56.760 --> 42:00.760\nYeah, it's not the light bulb.\n\n42:00.760 --> 42:02.760\nI mean, everyone had a podcast already.\n\n42:02.760 --> 42:03.760\nI was the last person to not have one.\n\n42:03.760 --> 42:05.760\nShe was like, come on, I feel bad for you.\n\n42:05.760 --> 42:06.760\nShe did?\n\n42:06.760 --> 42:09.760\nYeah, where is this going?\n\n42:09.760 --> 42:11.760\nSo I used to come and watch with her.\n\n42:11.760 --> 42:13.760\nBecause, you know, I really liked watching the show.\n\n42:13.760 --> 42:15.760\nSo I would come and hang out and watch the show for like a year.\n\n42:15.760 --> 42:17.760\nBut you had never played D&D before.\n\n42:17.760 --> 42:18.760\nNo.\n\n42:18.760 --> 42:19.760\nBut you're a gamer.\n\n42:19.760 --> 42:20.760\nYou love games, right?\n\n42:20.760 --> 42:21.760\nYeah, you know, I grew up in Pakistan.\n\n42:21.760 --> 42:22.760\nWe didn't really have...\n\n42:22.760 --> 42:24.760\nD&D wasn't really a thing.\n\n42:24.760 --> 42:25.760\nNobody I knew ever did.\n\n42:25.760 --> 42:31.760\nToo close to home.\n\n42:31.760 --> 42:32.760\nBecause of an institution...\n\n42:32.760 --> 42:35.760\nWhat do you think Pakistan is like?\n\n42:35.760 --> 42:36.760\nDragons?\n\n42:36.760 --> 42:37.760\nWell, Dan Harmon...\n\n42:37.760 --> 42:40.760\nI mean, you don't have first world problems, right?\n\n42:40.760 --> 42:47.760\nBy definition, we don't.\n\n42:47.760 --> 42:48.760\nI thought...\n\n42:48.760 --> 42:52.760\nHey, listen, all I know is what I read in my Noam Chomsky books.\n\n42:52.760 --> 42:58.760\nI thought we had institutionalized the system of enforced, you know, like, like, like, you know,\n\n42:58.760 --> 43:02.760\nmedieval, like, like, theocracy over there.\n\n43:02.760 --> 43:07.760\nLike, playing one against the other and kind of keeping everyone, everyone east of a certain\n\n43:07.760 --> 43:09.760\nline in a place where...\n\n43:09.760 --> 43:14.760\nI guess Pakistan is closer to D&D land than Minnesota.\n\n43:14.760 --> 43:15.760\nYes, yes.\n\n43:15.760 --> 43:17.760\nLet's end this spectrum.\n\n43:17.760 --> 43:18.760\nYeah, more caves.\n\n43:18.760 --> 43:19.760\nYeah, we have...\n\n43:19.760 --> 43:20.760\nI'm not saying there's ogres there.\n\n43:20.760 --> 43:21.760\nYou're on the line.\n\n43:21.760 --> 43:25.760\nCaves is right on the line.\n\n43:25.760 --> 43:30.760\nI feel like I really want to argue with you guys, but I can't really find an argument right\n\n43:30.760 --> 43:31.760\nnow.\n\n43:31.760 --> 43:32.760\nWell, it's an interesting...\n\n43:32.760 --> 43:33.760\nIt is.\n\n43:33.760 --> 43:39.260\nWhat is my obligation as a first world or a privileged guy growing up in Wisconsin?\n\n43:39.260 --> 43:48.760\nAm I a better person if I acknowledge that the Middle East is a kind of artificially enforced\n\n43:48.760 --> 43:50.760\nkind of medieval territory?\n\n43:50.760 --> 43:54.760\nOr am I a better person if I go, there are people too.\n\n43:54.760 --> 43:55.760\nThat's a great...\n\n43:55.760 --> 43:56.760\nOh, that's a...\n\n43:56.760 --> 43:59.560\nFor the Fertile Crescent, what a wonderful place, the Paris of the planet.\n\n43:59.560 --> 44:02.760\nI think there's a happy medium between those two.\n\n44:02.760 --> 44:08.760\nThe happy medium being that it's not medieval, and also it's not the Paris of the planet.\n\n44:08.760 --> 44:15.120\nI think the happy medium would be that you and I grew up in a culture where we have so\n\n44:15.120 --> 44:20.680\nmuch free time that we can pretend to live in a world where every corner you walk around\n\n44:20.680 --> 44:22.760\nlike a guy might chop you up with an axe.\n\n44:22.760 --> 44:23.760\nExactly.\n\n44:23.760 --> 44:24.760\nAgain...\n\n44:24.760 --> 44:25.760\nThat's our fantasy.\n\n44:25.760 --> 44:30.400\nI don't know how accurate that is per se.\n\n44:30.400 --> 44:36.320\nI mean, I do have axe wounds all over me, but if you're good at dodging, you can live to\n\n44:36.320 --> 44:42.600\nbe, you know, the average age is 19, but that's including the infant mortality.\n\n44:42.600 --> 44:44.120\nWe all saw Argo.\n\n44:44.120 --> 44:45.600\nWe all know everything.\n\n44:45.600 --> 44:50.720\nDan, do you think Pakistan is more magical than Wisconsin?\n\n44:50.720 --> 44:52.840\nI just...\n\n44:52.840 --> 44:55.320\nIt's more of all the territories over there.\n\n44:55.320 --> 44:56.320\nIt's like one of the...\n\n44:56.320 --> 44:57.320\nTerritories?\n\n44:57.320 --> 44:58.320\nYou mean countries?\n\n44:58.320 --> 44:59.320\nOf all the territories?\n\n44:59.320 --> 45:00.320\nAll the...\n\n45:00.320 --> 45:01.320\nYour tribes?\n\n45:01.320 --> 45:02.320\nOf all the...\n\n45:02.320 --> 45:03.320\nYou mean my family?\n\n45:03.320 --> 45:13.360\nOut of all the military bases that we have over there, it is one of the more westernized\n\n45:13.360 --> 45:16.560\nthat has had a tradition of collaboration with...\n\n45:16.560 --> 45:17.560\nYeah.\n\n45:17.560 --> 45:18.560\nIt's sort of...\n\n45:18.560 --> 45:19.560\nI would...\n\n45:19.560 --> 45:20.560\nThe Great Great Satan.\n\n45:20.560 --> 45:21.560\nTerminate it.\n\n45:21.560 --> 45:22.560\nFrenemy of America.\n\n45:22.560 --> 45:23.560\nYeah.\n\n45:23.560 --> 45:24.560\nFrenemy, yeah.\n\n45:24.560 --> 45:25.560\nYeah.\n\n45:25.560 --> 45:26.560\nFrenemies.\n\n45:26.560 --> 45:31.800\nIt really is because a lot of the country, obviously, against the West, because it sort\n\n45:31.800 --> 45:37.160\nof stands for everything, the opposite of what sort of Islam stands for in a lot of ways,\n\n45:37.160 --> 45:41.860\nbut then also there's a big seduction of the West, so once we got MTV, like boys started\n\n45:41.860 --> 45:45.000\nwearing shorts, so it's sort of a weird tussle.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:46.440\nIt really is.\n\n45:46.440 --> 45:48.800\nYou saw the country change once MTV happened.\n\n45:48.800 --> 45:49.800\nI saw it.\n\n45:49.800 --> 45:50.800\nYeah.\n\n45:50.800 --> 45:54.440\nIt was all over MTV.\n\n45:54.440 --> 45:58.280\nKurt Loder, you had the Pakistan transformation hour.\n\n45:58.280 --> 46:05.600\nNo, the...when 9-Eleven happened, there was...I really honestly can't recall the details,\n\n46:05.600 --> 46:07.800\nbut I remember Pakistan was sort of front and center in the headlines.\n\n46:07.800 --> 46:08.920\nI think it had something to do with...\n\n46:08.920 --> 46:09.920\nI could see that.\n\n46:09.920 --> 46:18.200\nWe needed...there's always some country like Libya, or something happens and America wants\n\n46:18.200 --> 46:24.080\nto maneuver something, and then there's some character that no one's thought about for\n\n46:24.080 --> 46:25.080\n10 years.\n\n46:25.080 --> 46:26.080\nNo one's used the word.\n\n46:26.080 --> 46:29.280\nI remember when 9-Eleven happened, it was like, Pakistan, Pakistan, Pakistan, not for\n\n46:29.280 --> 46:33.000\nanything relating to anything other than like airspace or like...\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:34.000\nWow.\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:37.440\nSo it's sort of like when I watched...I know what you did last summer, it kind of pissed\n\n46:37.440 --> 46:42.600\nme off that they were...the murder was some fisherman that they wronged a year ago that\n\n46:42.600 --> 46:43.600\nyou never saw.\n\n46:43.600 --> 46:45.800\nSo to you, Pakistan, is that fisherman.\n\n46:45.800 --> 46:46.800\nYeah, yeah.\n\n46:46.800 --> 46:47.800\nSorry, I haven't heard about this guy.\n\n46:47.800 --> 46:49.800\nYou were like, that's fucking country, why?\n\n46:49.800 --> 46:53.400\nBut there was some kind of thing, it was like, like, yeah, Pakistan was...\n\n46:53.400 --> 46:56.760\nThe idea that that was a safe house that were harboring, you know, al-Qaeda or something\n\n46:56.760 --> 46:57.760\nlike that, right?\n\n46:57.760 --> 47:03.000\nAnd or helping us, like it was like, you know, caught in between like the...was it Pakistan\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:06.920\nthat had the...no, that's Jordan, Jordan was also like came to the forefront, and that's\n\n47:06.920 --> 47:07.920\nwhat...\n\n47:07.920 --> 47:11.680\nJordan's gone, Pakistan, we're still hanging on to our 15 minutes.\n\n47:11.680 --> 47:15.920\nRemember the wake of 9-Eleven, like, this was like, just speaks to like the first world\n\n47:15.920 --> 47:21.880\nlike, like, kind of like, I don't know, god damn it, what's the word?\n\n47:21.880 --> 47:23.600\nEthnocentrism?\n\n47:23.600 --> 47:29.120\nDecadence, decadence, yeah.\n\n47:29.120 --> 47:34.720\nI remember sitting in a restaurant, and like, in the wake of 9-Eleven and everything, what\n\n47:34.720 --> 47:35.720\nare we going to do?\n\n47:35.720 --> 47:39.160\nThere's a lot of Middle Eastern talk, a lot of officials coming forward, presidents,\n\n47:39.160 --> 47:42.880\nprime ministers, all of a sudden people who haven't thought about the Middle East in ten\n\n47:42.880 --> 47:47.680\nyears are watching it on CNN and looking at like...and the king of Jordan comes out and\n\n47:47.680 --> 47:51.640\nlike, he's got this wife just like sitting there eating a cheeseburger going like, she's\n\n47:51.640 --> 47:52.640\nhot.\n\n47:52.640 --> 47:56.360\nRemember the king of Jordan, it was like, oh, she's hot.\n\n47:56.360 --> 47:57.360\nShe was hot.\n\n47:57.360 --> 48:02.480\nI don't know, I thought that would get a bigger laugh, like, I was saying like, there's terrorist\n\n48:02.480 --> 48:06.200\nattack happening, there's like all of this shit bubbling up, but it was like, I couldn't\n\n48:06.200 --> 48:07.200\neven...\n\n48:07.200 --> 48:11.320\nWell, what you do is you take something, you take something big and you try and digest\n\n48:11.320 --> 48:12.320\nit in the way you can.\n\n48:12.320 --> 48:16.000\nSo you're trying to turn it into an HBO miniseries.\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:27.360\nDo you remember when Saddam died, when they killed Saddam, right before that, they were\n\n48:27.360 --> 48:33.360\nlike, oh, he really liked Doritos, like, who, why are you telling us that?\n\n48:33.360 --> 48:34.520\nYou already killed him.\n\n48:34.520 --> 48:36.320\nIf you want us to like him, don't.\n\n48:36.320 --> 48:40.880\nYou'd be like, listen, turns out he likes Doritos, so we're going to stay out of execution.\n\n48:40.880 --> 48:41.880\nHe's not so different.\n\n48:41.880 --> 48:45.640\nThey're like, we killed him bad news, he liked Doritos, just like you do.\n\n48:45.640 --> 48:46.640\nFuck.\n\n48:46.640 --> 48:55.960\nWhile we're in this ticklish, sensitive, fun area, I remember you and I having a conversation\n\n48:55.960 --> 49:00.160\nbecause you're an actor, and you said you weren't back then, like, that was your first\n\n49:00.160 --> 49:06.360\naudition as an actor, and since then now you get a little acting career and a little, little.\n\n49:06.360 --> 49:09.640\nYou know, I heard the first little.\n\n49:09.640 --> 49:14.320\nI like that it goes from the big, like, making fun of where I'm from and my tribes, to now\n\n49:14.320 --> 49:15.840\nalso the person though.\n\n49:15.840 --> 49:17.440\nYeah, now we're going to go, it's very thorough.\n\n49:17.440 --> 49:21.840\nI've seen your bed where you sleep, it's weird, it's like, it's a straw.\n\n49:21.840 --> 49:26.240\nIt reminds me of home, Dan.\n\n49:26.240 --> 49:34.000\nI remember we had a conversation about like, the weird, like, like how, like, okay, a white\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:40.760\nactor in America gets sides, gets an audition, hey, they need a guy to play the male lead's\n\n49:40.760 --> 49:44.880\nbest friend, he kind of wants to fuck his girlfriend, but he's half gay and he loves\n\n49:44.880 --> 49:45.880\nbasketball.\n\n49:45.880 --> 49:49.720\nSo you come in, and you come in and you go like, like the biggest struggle an American\n\n49:49.720 --> 49:53.520\nwhite actor has as you go, like, oh, this guy's kind of Freddy, so I'm going to, I'm\n\n49:53.520 --> 49:56.880\ngoing to, I'm going to put my spin on it, but whatever, it's not written for me.\n\n49:56.880 --> 49:58.760\nBut then there's this whole other component happens.\n\n49:58.760 --> 50:02.840\nIf you're Asian, if you're Latin, if you're, if you're Middle Eastern, if you're whatever\n\n50:02.840 --> 50:10.400\nthe other things are, Mordor, yeah, if you're an elf, if you're a dwarf, if you're, yeah.\n\n50:10.400 --> 50:15.240\nSo, I remember having a conversation that was kind of provocative and interesting, like\n\n50:15.240 --> 50:19.560\nwhat we were talking about, like you being, like, through no choice of your own, you're\n\n50:19.560 --> 50:22.440\nat the forefront of that, because you have to ask yourself as a person, obviously with\n\n50:22.440 --> 50:30.520\nlike a 350 IQ, comes from, comes from, like, like, actually not, not a metric system, though.\n\n50:30.520 --> 50:35.360\nNot only ethnically, like, like, like, like, having this cross to bear, but actually, like,\n\n50:35.360 --> 50:41.160\nyou moved here, and, and are acting over here, and now you're, you get auditions, so you\n\n50:41.160 --> 50:45.320\ngo in, and it's like, you know, you imagine the kinds of things, like, like, like, we\n\n50:45.320 --> 50:49.560\nall know, like, it's like, it's like, oh, this guy's the quirky guy, like, we had a conversation\n\n50:49.560 --> 50:54.040\nabout it, but I was drunk, so, like, I don't remember it, but I remember it being fascinating,\n\n50:54.040 --> 50:59.280\nmaybe we could dig it up, and I'm like, Dr. Frankenstein was just so in parts together.\n\n50:59.280 --> 51:04.000\nI feel, okay, so for a long time, first of all, when I first started auditioning, it was,\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:09.880\nI was auditioning for a lot of parts, clearly, that Aziz had gotten too big for, they were\n\n51:09.880 --> 51:14.800\nclearly written in his voice, and I read, like, three cab drivers named Aziz, I fucking\n\n51:14.800 --> 51:15.800\nswear that happened.\n\n51:15.800 --> 51:23.280\nIt's a fun name, Aziz, yeah, it's, yeah, you imagine him swinging tree to tree, Dan.\n\n51:23.280 --> 51:29.160\nOh, sorry, cave to cave.\n\n51:29.160 --> 51:30.160\nThank you.\n\n51:30.160 --> 51:36.640\nWell, I think what it was, yeah, so I do a lot of auditions now where it's still, it's\n\n51:36.640 --> 51:42.200\ngetting better, but a lot of people will sort of basically tell me to up my accent without\n\n51:42.200 --> 51:45.240\nsaying it, so I'll, like, do the audition, they're like, oh, that was great, that was\n\n51:45.240 --> 51:52.720\ngreat, could you do it a little, like, even more, like, even more exaggerated, I'm like,\n\n51:52.720 --> 51:58.880\nfirst of all, I'm not doing anything, this is how I talk, and I made a decision, like,\n\n51:58.880 --> 52:02.640\ntwo years ago where I was like, I'm not going to change my accent for any of these auditions,\n\n52:02.640 --> 52:06.080\nso I've had a lot of auditions go well, and they're like, all right, now try it this way,\n\n52:06.080 --> 52:10.720\nand I get sort of upset, and it becomes, it's kind of obvious, and so I have it, but then\n\n52:10.720 --> 52:13.480\nI see, fucking, there's so many people, I don't want to name names, but there's people\n\n52:13.480 --> 52:19.040\nthat you know who are brown actors who I'll audition with, and I'll, I can fucking hear\n\n52:19.040 --> 52:25.320\nthem in there, like, pissing on their legacy, like, all doing all that shit, it fucking\n\n52:25.320 --> 52:26.840\npisses me off so much.\n\n52:26.840 --> 52:30.480\nWe're talking about Danny Peudy, right?\n\n52:30.480 --> 52:35.600\nFucking Danny Peudy, but it always gets me, that really angers me, it's like, it's like\n\n52:35.600 --> 52:39.000\nsort of like, they're like scabs, you know, like, come on, we're all in this together,\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:40.920\ndon't fucking, and then they get the part.\n\n52:40.920 --> 52:41.920\nRight.\n\n52:41.920 --> 52:42.920\nWow.\n\n52:42.920 --> 52:47.560\nMy ex-girlfriend Erin Hill, when I was dating her, she was a media studies, getting her\n\n52:47.560 --> 52:51.440\nmaster's degree, going for her PhD, and she would spend all this time going through these\n\n52:51.440 --> 52:55.960\narchives, and she uncovered this thing from the, probably the 40s or 50s, this Native\n\n52:55.960 --> 53:03.440\nAmerican actor, who, his head shot was like, it was signed, and he had a, he had a bowler\n\n53:03.440 --> 53:06.560\nhat with a feather in it, and it was here running down his face.\n\n53:06.560 --> 53:10.760\nYeah, well, that was the 70s, that was when we actually started to go, like, hey, these\n\n53:10.760 --> 53:17.360\nguys have clout, now that they're all dead, like, what if you made them cry?\n\n53:17.360 --> 53:25.520\nBack then, it was still like, hey, they're funny, their houses are pointy.\n\n53:25.520 --> 53:33.880\nHis head shot was like, signed, like, me wantum commission for agentum, like, much good wantum\n\n53:33.880 --> 53:38.280\nfor, you know, like, like, like, obviously, you can tell the guy was like, like, a good\n\n53:38.280 --> 53:39.280\nguy.\n\n53:39.280 --> 53:41.280\nYeah, he's like, how do I get the part?\n\n53:41.280 --> 53:42.280\nYeah.\n\n53:42.280 --> 53:49.640\nAnd it's like, hero or villain, or the whole Hollywood shuffle thing, like, but it's, the\n\n53:49.640 --> 53:55.080\ninteresting thing about it is the lack of, like, easy empirical truth, because if I'm\n\n53:55.080 --> 54:01.880\nan African-American actor, and I, like, like, why don't I, for instance, have the right,\n\n54:01.880 --> 54:07.440\nthe same right that a Caucasian actor would have to affect a Brooklyn accent, or take\n\n54:07.440 --> 54:11.760\nadvantage of the fact that I'm from Jersey, or, or, or, or that I have, that I know what\n\n54:11.760 --> 54:16.840\na Southern person sounds like, to, in order to try to get some part, or according to Francis\n\n54:16.840 --> 54:18.840\nor whatever they're doing.\n\n54:18.840 --> 54:23.200\nThe, if you're, now you're a black person and you're going in as an actor, and it's\n\n54:23.200 --> 54:27.040\nlike, well, this guy's, he's a little groovier, he's a little blacker than you're doing it,\n\n54:27.040 --> 54:29.240\nand that's not how you talk, but you're an actor.\n\n54:29.240 --> 54:33.480\nThat's the, it's, it's, it's a terrible thing to put someone in the, in the position of,\n\n54:33.480 --> 54:35.800\nyour, your, your craft is supposed to be pretending.\n\n54:35.800 --> 54:39.440\nYou're supposed to be able to pin medals to your chest to the extent that you're able\n\n54:39.440 --> 54:45.400\nto portray of, or, you know, a, a, a, a, a different, different aspects of yourself and\n\n54:45.400 --> 54:47.200\nother people, imaginary people.\n\n54:47.200 --> 54:52.440\nWe give awards to people who do it, who, who, who, who remove us from reality more.\n\n54:52.440 --> 54:57.160\nAnd so now, even though you didn't buy a ticket to that ride, here you are as an actor, when\n\n54:57.160 --> 55:01.200\nall the other actors get to just go, I either get the part or I don't, you have to, you\n\n55:01.200 --> 55:05.680\nhave to tweak it in your head and go, well, I either get the part or I don't, and there's\n\n55:05.680 --> 55:10.280\nway less parts, and on top of that, I have to fucking act like the, I have to.\n\n55:10.280 --> 55:14.600\nLike the one Indian guy, the one, like brown guy, the people that come, although the couple\n\n55:14.600 --> 55:18.800\nof things, one, it's, I feel it changing, like I've been getting parts that were written\n\n55:18.800 --> 55:20.840\nfor white guys and stuff, so it's changing.\n\n55:20.840 --> 55:26.480\nAnd I do think, honestly, that the character Abed on community did sort of change things\n\n55:26.480 --> 55:30.640\nbecause it was a kind of brown guy that we hadn't seen on TV before.\n\n55:30.640 --> 55:34.160\nAnd so when I read that, I was like, oh, when I watched the show, I was like, well, this\n\n55:34.160 --> 55:35.160\nis great.\n\n55:35.160 --> 55:36.160\nThis is, you know, a new kind of brown guy.\n\n55:36.160 --> 55:37.160\nThis is going to change.\n\n55:37.160 --> 55:40.720\nAnd then I read, like, the next pilot season, I read, like, five scripts that had, like,\n\n55:40.720 --> 55:43.200\nbasically Abed with different names.\n\n55:43.200 --> 55:46.680\nA friend of mine that I won't name because I want to get him troubled, read a pilot and\n\n55:46.680 --> 55:53.880\nthe, it's, I don't even want to describe it because I don't want anyone to get in trouble.\n\n55:53.880 --> 55:58.840\nBut, like, there's a, according to this friend of mine, there's literally a point in the\n\n55:58.840 --> 56:03.760\nscript where the other characters are introduced to this kind of wacky ensemble.\n\n56:03.760 --> 56:08.640\nAnd literally the names of the characters are Asian lady and fat guy and, like, they\n\n56:08.640 --> 56:09.640\ndidn't do it.\n\n56:09.640 --> 56:12.160\nIt's like, whoa, it got home by three today, huh?\n\n56:12.160 --> 56:13.160\nOh, crazy.\n\n56:13.160 --> 56:17.360\nSo, and I really think that if you're, you know, since the Harmontown audience, I assume\n\n56:17.360 --> 56:21.920\nis 90% writers and 85% 25-year-old writers.\n\n56:21.920 --> 56:28.240\nLike, I think that the way to break the cycle starts at the, starts at what I used to call\n\n56:28.240 --> 56:29.240\nthe typewriter.\n\n56:29.240 --> 56:35.040\nLike, you, I think the key to it is, like, you have to avoid the temptation.\n\n56:35.040 --> 56:40.200\nLike, like, with the Abed character in community, that was the one exception in that script\n\n56:40.200 --> 56:45.800\nwhere you actually bothered to explicitly say, he says he's half Palestinian or something\n\n56:45.800 --> 56:46.800\nlike that.\n\n56:46.800 --> 56:50.600\nLike, it was, it was in part real Abed is half Palestinian and felt important to the\n\n56:50.600 --> 56:52.480\ncharacter to me for some reason.\n\n56:52.480 --> 56:53.480\nMaybe I was right.\n\n56:53.480 --> 56:54.480\nMaybe I was wrong.\n\n56:54.480 --> 56:57.760\nIt makes sense because he's a guy who's half, so he's sort of obsessed with pop culture,\n\n56:57.760 --> 57:02.160\nbut then there's also this other part of him that sort of, it sort of makes him an observer,\n\n57:02.160 --> 57:05.840\neven though it's not specifically a racial thing, but somebody who's sort of straddling\n\n57:05.840 --> 57:07.080\ntwo cultures like that.\n\n57:07.080 --> 57:12.360\nMaybe, I mean, in retrospect, but not, I mean, he could have been a white guy and it wouldn't\n\n57:12.360 --> 57:13.360\nhave been.\n\n57:13.360 --> 57:15.520\nThere was one storyline with his dad that was a little specific to that.\n\n57:15.520 --> 57:18.960\nIn retrospect, he definitely could have been a white guy and he surely could have been\n\n57:18.960 --> 57:23.440\nhalf Indian, half Polish, which Deity Pudi is, but at the time there was this whole,\n\n57:23.440 --> 57:26.440\nnot the whole brouhaha, but it's just like, I monitor Twitter and it's like, there's\n\n57:26.440 --> 57:29.760\nall kinds of different viewpoints that come in and some, you know, justifiably some come\n\n57:29.760 --> 57:33.840\nin and go, why, why do you have an Indian guy playing a half Indian guy playing a half\n\n57:33.840 --> 57:34.840\nArabic guy?\n\n57:34.840 --> 57:36.040\nLike, like, what are you doing?\n\n57:36.040 --> 57:37.720\nSo all brown people, blah, blah, blah.\n\n57:37.720 --> 57:38.720\nVery justifiable, absolutely.\n\n57:38.720 --> 57:40.800\nBut it didn't shake down that way.\n\n57:40.800 --> 57:47.080\nYou create a character, you say, okay, this is based on my friend, Real Abed, whose dad\n\n57:47.080 --> 57:50.960\nwas Palestinian and whose mom was whatever, Nordic or something, and who had this very\n\n57:50.960 --> 57:53.360\nspecific backstory to him, you know?\n\n57:53.360 --> 57:59.040\nHis dad was like, like, it had really a lot to do with the relationship with his dad,\n\n57:59.040 --> 58:00.040\nwhich we did explore.\n\n58:00.040 --> 58:07.760\nLike, his dad was not a fundamentalist Muslim, but a passionate one, a stern guy, a kind\n\n58:07.760 --> 58:12.840\nof great Santini type in my head, and that would be because father and son stories are\n\n58:12.840 --> 58:15.280\nvery important to male characters.\n\n58:15.280 --> 58:20.000\nThat was important, and it was like, race isn't important, that's an artificial construct,\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:24.880\nbut nationality of your parents could be called an important thing.\n\n58:24.880 --> 58:29.960\nSo then Danny Pudi walks in, fucking blows the roof off the room, okay, like, can we\n\n58:29.960 --> 58:34.600\nstop talking about how good he was in the audition?\n\n58:34.600 --> 58:38.360\nWe get it, he got the part, then.\n\n58:38.360 --> 58:39.360\nYou know what?\n\n58:39.360 --> 58:41.560\nI was really upset when I didn't get it, but when I saw the show, I was like, oh, the\n\n58:41.560 --> 58:42.560\nright guy got it.\n\n58:42.560 --> 58:43.560\nAnyway, go ahead.\n\n58:43.560 --> 58:44.560\nNo, I think that's the great thing about casting.\n\n58:44.560 --> 58:51.480\nYeah, it's like, no one's gonna feel bad about this, like, let's all watch the fireworks.\n\n58:51.480 --> 58:55.240\nBut then, so later on, it's like, the tweet's coming, and it really vexed me, because I'm\n\n58:55.240 --> 58:59.280\nlike, I've got all this white guilt, and like, I want to be Norman Lair, I don't want to\n\n58:59.280 --> 59:04.360\nbe, I don't want to be a bad person, I want to use my talent right, I want to contribute,\n\n59:04.360 --> 59:10.080\nI want to make people happy, and people are going like, why is this brown guy playing\n\n59:10.080 --> 59:15.280\na different kind of brown guy so torn between like, this is a slippery slope, where you go\n\n59:15.280 --> 59:16.280\nlike, oh.\n\n59:16.280 --> 59:19.280\nBy the way, that's not an issue to me, or any, I mean, that's, they're really, really-\n\n59:19.280 --> 59:23.280\nI think it's a justifiable issue to some people, but it all depends on where you, it's all\n\n59:23.280 --> 59:30.000\ndepends on the context, like if you, it really is, it's such a, it's such a strange time\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:33.880\nto be alive, and I think, I think, I think that there is no, there is no magic wand to\n\n59:33.880 --> 59:38.200\nwave over it, no rule, but I definitely think it starts with people writing scripts where\n\n59:38.200 --> 59:44.360\nyou gotta, you gotta detach yourself from, like it's, it's like, you just go like, oh,\n\n59:44.360 --> 59:49.760\nthis character is amazing, he's this big fat black guy, and he, but he talks like a little\n\n59:49.760 --> 59:51.600\ngirl, isn't that a great character?\n\n59:51.600 --> 59:57.040\nNo, it's not, like, that's a great actor if that guy comes in, and plays the character\n\n59:57.040 --> 59:58.040\nof-\n\n59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.840\nWell, how important would it be to you if, if you changed the gender of people, like-\n\n01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.920\nWell, that's where, yeah, where do you stop, and that's, like, like, like, do we, do we,\n\n01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:09.680\ndo we progress to a weird Gene Roddenberry age, where screenplays are like, ones and\n\n01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:14.480\nzeros, and you're kind of like, the, the rook has a problem with the pawn, you know, and\n\n01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.440\nthey said, I don't know, and does, and does that mitigate creativity, does that mitigate\n\n01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.600\npassion, obviously the answer is yes, because to the extent that you do that, then some\n\n01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:29.120\npunk rock writer's gonna go, two black dudes walk in, fucking script rules, you know, whatever,\n\n01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.640\nso we don't, we don't have to keep talking about that, it's because there's no, there\n\n01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:36.160\nis no, there is no, there is no finish line for that, I think, I think the discourse is\n\n01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:40.440\nthe valuable thing, I, I, I think that people talking about it is the only place that's\n\n01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.440\nvery-\n\n01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.080\nI think as long as you're aware of that, you know, I think a lot of times, a lot of scripts\n\n01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.240\nI read, it's just funny, I can read it, I'm like, oh, the line isn't funny, it's funny,\n\n01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:52.840\nbecause whoever wrote it in his head, heard it in an Apu accent or whatever, that happens\n\n01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:59.520\na lot, and I've gone into, I, I don't want to, ah, this is too specific, alright, okay,\n\n01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:07.200\nso, this is very specific, can I sort of tell you later to take it out if I decide, is that\n\n01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.200\nokay?\n\n01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.200\nYeah, yeah, that's right.\n\n01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.200\nWell, I had this one, you raped a baby.\n\n01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.200\nI did this one movie.\n\n01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.200\nWhat'd you say?\n\n01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.200\nYou raped a baby.\n\n01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:20.080\nT-T-T-T-T-L-D-R, yeah, yeah, I wanted to rape a black baby, but then, you know, I was\n\n01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.920\nlike, well, it doesn't matter, it was like Hispanic or whatever.\n\n01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.920\nSome kind of-\n\n01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:26.920\nSnickers.\n\n01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.920\nWhat?\n\n01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.080\nI'm sorry, we can't edit it out, that's where we did our Snickers spot.\n\n01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.880\nThey pay us a lot of money.\n\n01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.120\nShirt design t-shirts, so soft.\n\n01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:44.120\nThis, say, we're brought to you by the Misco.\n\n01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.960\nI, ah, I, this movie that I did not audition for that seen my stuff that I liked, and it\n\n01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.120\nwasn't a huge part, so I went in, and the first day of shooting, they were like, so\n\n01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.720\nhow thick are you going to do your accent?\n\n01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.320\nAnd I was like, well, I'm not going to do it thick at all.\n\n01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.320\nAnd they were like, what do you mean?\n\n01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.080\nIt's written, it's supposed to be a thick Indian accent.\n\n01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:02.480\nI was like, well, I sort of have the 10 year out of Pakistan accent, and that's what it's\n\n01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.480\ngoing to be.\n\n01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.720\nSo it became this huge thing, ah, producers were calling in stuff, and I called my agent,\n\n01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.840\nand I was like, you know, I think they're going to fire me off this movie.\n\n01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:16.200\nAnd I was like, I know I can make this part funny being myself with the lines, but I don't\n\n01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.520\nknow if I can make it funny if you want me to do like a crazy accent.\n\n01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.920\nAnd then I just, I was like, just let me do one the way I talk, and then we can talk after\n\n01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.920\nthat.\n\n01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.080\nAnd it worked, and it worked great, and they were like, alright, just do what you're doing.\n\n01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.560\nSo I think a lot of people are just scared of writing parts or imagining parts that don't\n\n01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.640\nfit into whatever, you know, their little boxes or whatever.\n\n01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.640\nIt's hard to see.\n\n01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:39.560\nYou get, you know, in the beginning, like there was a, now there are a lot of black\n\n01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.800\nactor characters on TV, and they're all sort of varied and different.\n\n01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.000\nAnd I'm sure there's still strides to be made.\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.760\nBut there was an actor, Emily was telling me about this, there was an actor in, when\n\n01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.320\nwas it, Emily?\n\n01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.960\nHis name was Sleep and Eat, is what he went by.\n\n01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:58.400\nAnd his whole mythology, sleep aid, sleep and eat, like sleep and eat, he was an actor,\n\n01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.880\nand his whole thing was just give me a place to sleep and something to eat, and I'll work\n\n01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.480\nfor you like he totally played up that whole.\n\n01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.200\nHe could step or fetch it.\n\n01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.440\nYeah, it really was like that.\n\n01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.440\nIt was like that.\n\n01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.040\nAnd so, so, and that was...\n\n01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:16.000\nHe wanted Wampum for his, yeah, that wasn't that long ago, you know, and it's changed.\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.360\nSo yeah, so on one side of it, yeah, you got writers, writers have got to do everything\n\n01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:24.760\nthey can to go like, okay, I'm going to create a character that's based on an emotional component.\n\n01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.760\nAnd if there's biographical components that comes out of the watch, and then on the actor's\n\n01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.880\nside, it's like, I think if you're the Meryl Streep of Pakistani actors, then you could\n\n01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.680\nmaybe fuck around with it, they go like, yeah, lay the accent on a little more thick, you\n\n01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:41.080\ngo like, okay, I'm going to do that based on my decades of studying all of these different\n\n01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.080\nkinds of...\n\n01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.080\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:47.240\nYeah, for me, it was, I decided not to do it because it was hard for me to parse which\n\n01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.840\nparts were the guy with a thick accent, and it made sense in the story, it made sense\n\n01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.480\nfor the character, and which parts were, because that was going mostly for comedies, which parts\n\n01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.600\nwere a thick accent just because the guy thought it would be funnier for a thick accent Indian\n\n01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.880\nguy to say a motherfucker or whatever, you know?\n\n01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.200\nOr talk about Star Wars, which was like a big thing before...\n\n01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.200\nOh yeah.\n\n01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.200\nThat was why Abed was like an important thing to me, because it was like, I want him to\n\n01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.960\nbe the foremost expert, yes, he's going to be talking about pop culture, it's not funny\n\n01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:17.400\nbecause he doesn't have an accent, he's, it's like before that, I mean he has an accent\n\n01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.400\nthat's the American accent.\n\n01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:23.720\nLet me ask you a question, when Batman fights Bob the Goon in issue number three, it's funny,\n\n01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:26.680\noh, because listen to how he talks, he's not supposed to know about Star Wars, and that's\n\n01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:31.320\nlike, that to me is like, kind of like a black guy in a dress, it's like all the part of\n\n01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:35.800\nthe same like tree, it's like, okay, there's nothing, the character's not real, the character's\n\n01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800\nlike a...\n\n01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.760\nYeah, but then also when you think of something like nerd, the way that nerds are written\n\n01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:45.480\na lot of times are also in a box, so you know, Star Wars is a good example, I read so many\n\n01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.000\nscripts with someone, is it talk about Star Wars, that's like, oh, they're a nerd, they're\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.640\na nerd, and I would always, if I'm working on something and there's a Star Wars reference,\n\n01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:57.160\nI'm like, that feels so generic, that feels like you're just saying sci-fi, make it more\n\n01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.600\nspecific, make it, you know, Lord of the Rings or something.\n\n01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:05.840\nSo for everything you do, there's these sort of pointers, like little ways that you put\n\n01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:13.040\npeople in boxes, I can't, I believe you guys are here still.\n\n01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:16.000\nBe a better writer and be a better actor, and we'll all meet somewhere in between.\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nAll right, speaking of characters and, let's pull my pants down.\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.680\nYeah, Dan, whip that dick out on these people.\n\n01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.680\nI want to show you these two characters, Clifford and Northumberland.\n\n01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.680\nLet's bring Spencer...\n\n01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.680\nThey're classics?\n\n01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:31.680\nThey're classics.\n\n01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.320\nSpencer, Spencer, will you come to the stage?\n\n01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:38.320\nSpencer Crittenden is in...\n\n01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:44.920\nSpencer Crittenden, Detective Master extraordinaire.\n\n01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:50.960\nHey, I have something to ask Kumeil while Spencer sets up, because we don't do anything\n\n01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.960\nlike very...\n\n01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:57.600\nWe're not a big, planning podcast, and as a person, I don't make a lot of plans and contact\n\n01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:04.880\na lot of people, but this is your third time up here, and are you bummed out that you have\n\n01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.360\nto keep coming up, or are you...\n\n01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:09.480\nNo, I love being on stage with you guys, it's always super fun.\n\n01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.720\nOkay, because your character can like fall off a cliff, or also like, you don't have\n\n01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.720\nto...\n\n01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:14.720\nLike, there's no pressure.\n\n01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.720\nI know.\n\n01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:21.920\nBut if your character had maybe a little bit more...\n\n01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.920\nYou give us more...\n\n01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.920\nWhat's the word I'm looking for, Dan?\n\n01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920\nI don't know.\n\n01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.920\nSpice.\n\n01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.920\nA little more...\n\n01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:34.720\nYou know what's funny, could you cave it up a little more?\n\n01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.720\nCave it up!\n\n01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.720\nWhat's funny is...\n\n01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.800\nKiko, cave it up.\n\n01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.040\nFor black actors, there is a phrase that always says, be more street.\n\n01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.880\nThat's what they say, or more urban.\n\n01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.320\nFor my people, there isn't that word yet.\n\n01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.320\nAttitude, attitude.\n\n01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.320\nYeah, attitude.\n\n01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.320\nBlack people hear a lot.\n\n01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.320\nFor us, there aren't...\n\n01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:53.880\nThere isn't like a set number of like adjectives that you can use to really...\n\n01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:54.880\nThere must be some.\n\n01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.240\nThere's certainly in casting offices...\n\n01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.200\nThey'll say even more...\n\n01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.920\nSome people are stereotypical, obviously.\n\n01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.000\nThey say, yeah, that one's harsh.\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.960\nOne woman was like, all right, that's good, but even more funny.\n\n01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.600\nBut the way she said it was like, you know what I mean?\n\n01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.600\nLike...\n\n01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.800\nYou know, like you people.\n\n01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.800\nCould you be less...\n\n01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:19.800\nCould you be less six, ten, and more, I don't know, seven, eleven?\n\n01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:20.800\nYeah.\n\n01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.800\nYeah.\n\n01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.320\nYou're at an eight, need you at a seven, eleven.\n\n01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.080\nWhat I'm getting right now is like a B plus poo.\n\n01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.080\nYeah.\n\n01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.080\nI'm like a...\n\n01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.080\nThey really want you to do...\n\n01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.080\nLike a B poo.\n\n01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:36.280\nThey really want you to do the Appu accent, which is voiced by a white guy.\n\n01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.280\nHilarious.\n\n01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.800\nThat idea of an Indian accent is literally a white guy.\n\n01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.800\nOh.\n\n01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.800\nAnyway.\n\n01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.800\nBut you know what?\n\n01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.800\nIt is getting better.\n\n01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:45.800\nWhat did you think about...\n\n01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.800\nGod damn it.\n\n01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:47.800\nWhat's his name?\n\n01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:48.800\nHe's an awesome actor, a monk.\n\n01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:49.800\nTony Shalu.\n\n01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:50.800\nTony Shalu.\n\n01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:51.800\nWhat did...\n\n01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.800\nDid you see Quick Change with Bill Murray?\n\n01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:53.800\nI don't remember.\n\n01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:54.800\nI saw it when I was a little kid.\n\n01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.800\nHe plays a cab driver in it.\n\n01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.720\nBad, bad, bad first impression.\n\n01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.560\nLike, and he plays a cab driver who is very...\n\n01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.120\nHe doesn't speak English.\n\n01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.120\nAnd he's like...\n\n01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.120\nIt's just this farce.\n\n01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.560\nLike, Bill Murray's trying to get out of town.\n\n01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.680\nHe robbed a bank and now he can't get out of New York.\n\n01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:15.680\nAnd one of the complications is, like, Jason Robards plays as a detective, he's one step\n\n01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.840\nbehind Bill Murray and he's trying to pick up his trail.\n\n01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:24.280\nTony Shalu played this, like, just on paper, like, he's a Middle Eastern cab driver.\n\n01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:28.080\nHe's one of the many things about New York that prevents you from getting out after a\n\n01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.920\nbank robbery.\n\n01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:35.920\nAnd so he's witnessed to the fact that Randy Quaid, like, fell out of the cab, blah, blah,\n\n01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:36.920\nblah, blah.\n\n01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:41.120\nBill Murray is interrogating him, like, where did they go, where did they go?\n\n01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.920\nAnd he's doing, like, this mime stick, like, on paper, like, it couldn't be more, like...\n\n01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.760\nHe's going, Bluff Tony, Bluff Tony!\n\n01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.440\nAnd he's, like, miming, honking a horn.\n\n01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.560\nHe's trying to tell them through his, you know...\n\n01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:58.320\nHow is he a cab driver if we can't understand English?\n\n01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:04.040\nI remember the first time realizing, like, watching Short Circuit, Fisher Stevens, and\n\n01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.560\nbeing like, that's not...\n\n01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.560\nYeah.\n\n01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.960\nI don't know what we look like, and it's not that.\n\n01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.960\nThe...\n\n01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.960\nI just...\n\n01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.960\nI...\n\n01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:12.960\nI...\n\n01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:18.360\nI just always, like, like, if you watch it, go rent Quick Change, so it's a really, like,\n\n01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.280\nI don't know, it's an amazing little, like, three in the morning movie, Snuggle Up with\n\n01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:28.080\nYour Girlfriend, or Boyfriend, Open Minded Night, and, or your dog, but not if...\n\n01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.080\nWhatever.\n\n01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.080\nIt doesn't...\n\n01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.440\nDon't fuck your dog, that's what we're saying.\n\n01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:35.680\nAnd also, I'm not equating bestiality with homosexuality, or with heterosexuality.\n\n01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:38.960\nNo, no, no, those are three distinct types of people.\n\n01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:39.960\nCut...\n\n01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.960\nCuttle up with whatever you want to cuddle up with.\n\n01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:42.960\nOr don't cuddle.\n\n01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:43.960\nHang upside down like a bat.\n\n01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:44.960\nDon't cuddle.\n\n01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:45.960\nDon't cuddle.\n\n01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.560\nThe point is not what you're doing, the point is the movie.\n\n01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.400\nThere's no wrong way to watch Quick Change is what you're saying.\n\n01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.400\nI don't know.\n\n01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:57.200\nI think fucking your dog and watching it might be...\n\n01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.120\nI think that's a bigotative view, to say that.\n\n01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.120\nI say...\n\n01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.120\nYeah, what if the dog's into it?\n\n01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.120\nThere are people...\n\n01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.120\nWhy is that a crime?\n\n01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.800\nWell, a lot of people are going to hear this podcast, and some of them may want to rape\n\n01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.640\nan animal while they watch Quick Change, and I say...\n\n01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.640\nWell, I'm raping...\n\n01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.640\nWell, I say...\n\n01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.640\nI say good for you.\n\n01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.640\nNo, rape...\n\n01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:13.640\nRape sensual.\n\n01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.640\nRape sensual.\n\n01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:15.640\nAnd what...\n\n01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.140\nThe important thing is that you watch Quick Change.\n\n01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:20.160\nThe animals aren't important here.\n\n01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.160\nDifferent people...\n\n01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.160\nYeah.\n\n01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.160\nDifferent priorities.\n\n01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.160\nRight?\n\n01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.160\nA stereotypical Middle Eastern character while watching Quick Change.\n\n01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.000\nJust watch Quick Change.\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:33.960\nTony Shalub walks into this character that is written as a sand trap of stereotypicality.\n\n01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.960\nSand trap.\n\n01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.960\nHe's no punny.\n\n01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:36.960\nWow.\n\n01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:37.960\nI love that play.\n\n01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:38.960\nNo words.\n\n01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:39.960\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:44.480\nOkay, the reason I said that is because I didn't see it as a thing, because I don't think\n\n01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.480\nit was.\n\n01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.480\nReally?\n\n01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.480\nGolf?\n\n01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.480\nSo...\n\n01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.480\nParts of you saw it.\n\n01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.480\nYou're a big golfer.\n\n01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.840\nDan, this is the first golf finale you used in the entire run of the show.\n\n01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:57.640\nWell, if racism is that unconscious, then hey, well, yeah.\n\n01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:09.800\nHe's trying to curry favor with the police officer.\n\n01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.680\nTony Shalub, who is like, like, I...\n\n01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:18.920\nThen you can salvage this.\n\n01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:19.920\nGo watch it.\n\n01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.680\nIt's the scene Jason Robards is talking to this guy, this character that may as well be\n\n01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:27.120\nMickey Rooney in Breakfast in Tiffany's.\n\n01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.200\nOh, dear.\n\n01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:34.520\nBut Tony Shalub, like, who didn't say no to that audition, I'm not at all flying in the\n\n01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:38.920\nface of anything that we've said, but it's an interesting thing to look at, because\n\n01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:52.160\nTony Shalub, like, he made some decision walking under the set that, look, I'm an actor, and\n\n01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.880\nI'm going to make people feel this character's pain and frustration.\n\n01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.560\nI'm not going to make them hear his funny accent.\n\n01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:04.880\nAnd here's the only thing I can remember from that scene is, like, Jesus Christ, this guy\n\n01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.000\nis so scared.\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.440\nAnd so, like, he's alone and he doesn't know what's happening, like, it breaks you to the\n\n01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.200\nbrink of tears.\n\n01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:18.680\nIt's just supposed to be this stupid gag about this guy that talks funny, but I'm telling\n\n01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:19.680\nyou, like, take a look at it.\n\n01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.680\nTell me if I'm wrong.\n\n01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:21.680\nEmail me, whatever.\n\n01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:22.680\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.400\nNext time in town, we just screened a quick change.\n\n01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.760\nI can guarantee you, we'll get Tony Shalub for that one.\n\n01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.920\nOh, my God, that would be amazing.\n\n01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:35.880\nAnother thing I remember the first time being, like, watching this, and as a kid, and being\n\n01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:39.240\nlike, that's not right, was, I think it was bad boys, where there's a part where they're\n\n01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:43.280\ntalking to, like, a clerk at basically a 7-Eleven, whatever.\n\n01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:44.280\nDo you remember that scene?\n\n01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.440\nAnd the guy calls him a mother bitch.\n\n01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:51.340\nAnd I was like, aw, we know everybody, if you know enough to know that bitch is a swear\n\n01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:55.880\nword and that mother something is a swear word, you know it's mother fucker.\n\n01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.080\nMother bitch, nobody's ever said that.\n\n01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.680\nIt's funny, it's funny.\n\n01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:00.680\nYou guys are like mad libs.\n\n01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:01.680\nYou don't know what you're doing.\n\n01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.680\nYeah.\n\n01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:10.160\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, my goodness, chicken, I burned all your motherless dog, I put a goat\n\n01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.280\nin your foot, you chowed, chowed punter.\n\n01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:19.280\nSpencer, keep it the fuck down, would you?\n\n01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.280\nEnough.\n\n01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.280\nAll right, we need enough.\n\n01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:22.280\nSorry.\n\n01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:27.560\nWe need a stool and a mic for, for, for Sedona, Mulraine, Mulraine's side.\n\n01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.080\nSharon McGathey for the stage, would you?\n\n01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:36.560\nSpencer, get us up to date in our, in our campaign, would you please?\n\n01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.560\nYeah, did anything happen last night?\n\n01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.560\nWhat can you guys, can you guys?\n\n01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.560\nHuh?\n\n01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.560\nDid anything happen last time?\n\n01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:51.920\nI have, I have a vague memory, I, I, I, I was in bed knitting Jeff a scarf, did anything\n\n01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:52.920\nhappen?\n\n01:13:52.920 --> 01:14:00.160\nOh yeah, I, I, I fucked your horse, but also I fucked a bird and I fucked a squirrel, I\n\n01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.320\nfucked a lot of things.\n\n01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.440\nYou fucked a half a dead zombie?\n\n01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.760\nI fucked, yeah, I was, I don't know if you fucked it in the appropriate part or if you\n\n01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:11.040\njust fucked the, where it got sliced, it was unclear.\n\n01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:16.120\nAdam Goldberg was, was texting me last week during the show, live texting Jeff just, Jeff\n\n01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.640\njust fucked your horse.\n\n01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.920\nAnd then Dustin Marshall was like, not a real horse, you know.\n\n01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:24.920\nWell, Spencer, take it away.\n\n01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:30.800\nThe horse is as real as the fucking it got, I mean, relatively speaking.\n\n01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.800\nWhen we last met, our heroes had been following Christopher, the bard to the fabled ruins\n\n01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.200\nof Mercule, home of the soul of growth.\n\n01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.880\nAfter traveling for a time, day shifted to night, and before long, the sound of unsettling\n\n01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:47.120\nmoans and wails echoed throughout the forest.\n\n01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:53.800\nLess than cognizant of the impending threat, our heroes took a rest break, discussing music,\n\n01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:59.520\nstudying ancient tomes and fucking wildlife, until, until a grip of zombies were all but\n\n01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.720\nupon them.\n\n01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:07.720\nMulraine, who in a fey mood bargained with the party over her use of the entangle spell,\n\n01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:12.000\neventually decided to use it and captured several zombies.\n\n01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.640\nAfter making quick, several concessions, the party waited for the forest to do its bidding.\n\n01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.600\nAfter entangling their foes, the two made, the, the barbarian, with the help of the new\n\n01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:28.720\nblood spell cast by Sharpie, made quick work of the remaining zombies' stranglers.\n\n01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.680\nThis is all going to shit.\n\n01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:36.240\nThe party pressed on before arriving at an ancient crumbling ruin deep within the forests\n\n01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.160\nof Twila.\n\n01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.560\nSo if you can see, I'm not even on the music, I'm so sorry everybody.\n\n01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:45.560\nYou got, you got 26 seconds.\n\n01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:46.560\nHow are you feeling?\n\n01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.060\nDoes that how you're feeling?\n\n01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:54.040\nWalking through the ruins, you notice several stone statues before you, lurking and guarding\n\n01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.040\nthe ruins within.\n\n01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:05.440\nSpencer everybody.\n\n01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.440\nThanks audience.\n\n01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.440\nAll right.\n\n01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.440\nOkay.\n\n01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:16.480\nSo it's Quark, Sharpie, Mulraine and Chris de Burgh, who, uh, he wrote, he wrote and performed\n\n01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.480\nThe Lady in Red.\n\n01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.480\nYeah.\n\n01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.480\nHuge hit.\n\n01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.480\nYeah.\n\n01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:24.200\nCareers kind of falling on, you know, maybe a bit of a, a bit of a low.\n\n01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.680\nI would say so.\n\n01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.960\nYou certainly didn't expect that you'd find yourself here.\n\n01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.160\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:33.920\nI thought once I had Lady in Red, I was like, oh, the world is more like, I looked in the\n\n01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.320\nmirror and I was like, this shit's too easy.\n\n01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:37.320\nYeah.\n\n01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.320\nSergeant Pepper.\n\n01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.320\nNow here you are.\n\n01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:41.040\nYou're standing outside of a stone ruin.\n\n01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.200\nUh, who knows what's going to happen?\n\n01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.200\nYeah.\n\n01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.200\nI've heard horses being fucked.\n\n01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.200\nYeah.\n\n01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.200\nShit's, shit's gone off track.\n\n01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.200\nAll right.\n\n01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.040\nSo, uh, I examined surrounding Spencer.\n\n01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:58.600\nThe masonry appears ancient, part of some long past ruined civilization.\n\n01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.960\nMost prominence are worn and crumbling statues stood on stone pedestals bearing the likeness\n\n01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.280\nof humanoids with bestial heads.\n\n01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.360\nThey appear to be dragon heads.\n\n01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:11.840\nThe statues flank a well-worn stone floor that leads about 60 feet down to a thick\n\n01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:16.640\nstand of tightly knit trees between the trees as a small crevice in the dead center of the\n\n01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.520\nclump of trees.\n\n01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.120\nI find, uh, sorry.\n\n01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.040\nNo, that's, I was, I was just saying go.\n\n01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.040\nSorry.\n\n01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.040\nSorry.\n\n01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.040\nIt's okay.\n\n01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.040\nIt's okay, Spencer.\n\n01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.040\nAre we cool?\n\n01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.040\nI, my self-esteem is just.\n\n01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.040\nWhat's going on, Spencer?\n\n01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.040\nYou seem a little down.\n\n01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.040\nSpencer, you're a true dungeon master.\n\n01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.040\nWhat's going on, Spencer?\n\n01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.040\nYou're the best.\n\n01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:34.040\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.040\nThanks, guys.\n\n01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.040\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.040\nI couldn't tell you.\n\n01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.040\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.040\nI had a great, I had a great day with Nolan.\n\n01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.040\nUm, you know, I, I had.\n\n01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.040\nChristopher?\n\n01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.040\nI wish.\n\n01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.040\nYeah.\n\n01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.040\nWhat a name drop that would be.\n\n01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:46.040\nHe's just like, he's just out there.\n\n01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.040\nWith Nolan.\n\n01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.040\nNo.\n\n01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.040\nSitting on top of the Hollywood stand.\n\n01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.040\nYeah.\n\n01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.040\nWe're in talks for a fourth Batman.\n\n01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.040\nWhat if this H was in another H?\n\n01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.040\nChristopher, you're amazing.\n\n01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.040\nYeah.\n\n01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:02.760\nWhat was the question?\n\n01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:03.760\nWho is Nolan?\n\n01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:05.760\nWhat?\n\n01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.760\nHe's, he's there.\n\n01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.760\nOh.\n\n01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760\nSpencer, you don't see yourself tonight.\n\n01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.760\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:10.760\nYeah.\n\n01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:11.760\nNo.\n\n01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.760\nUh,

dog?\n\n01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.480\nI couldn't even tell you what I got.\n\n01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:23.080\nIt was like, I thought I was going to get something and then I saw these little squares\n\n01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.760\nthat said try these other things and I tried one of the other things.\n\n01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.760\nYou mean menus?\n\n01:18:26.760 -->

--> 01:18:36.760\nThe problem is that the hot dog was too big.\n\n01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:41.760\nYou might have just wanted a bite of the hot dog.\n\n01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.760\nI'm still, what?\n\n01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:48.760\nAre you saying that your stomach is a little turmoil right now?\n\n01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:49.760\nNo.\n\n01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.760\nAre you shitting like a

things that make you equally happy.\n\n01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:36.760\nLike you can actually have peanut butter and cake at the same time.\n\n01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.760\nIt was our tea day and I was like, Dan, what do you want?\n\n01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.760\nHe was like, meh, peanut butter cake.\n\n01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.760\nI was like, that's not real.\n\n01:19:42.760 -->

01:20:22.760\nconsensual with Coco, right?\n\n01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:23.760\nIt became consensual.\n\n01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.760\nThat's the rapiest thing anyone has ever said.\n\n01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:27.760\nNo, no.\n\n01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.760\nShe stopped resisting.\n\n01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.760\nIt became consensual.\n\n01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.760\nShe stopped crying.\n\n01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.760\nI did not rape Coco.\n\n01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.760\nI fucked Coco and Coco dug it.\n\n01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:37.760\nDid she?\n\n01:20:37.760 -->

--> 01:21:39.760\nI randomly determined that it was consensual.\n\n01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:40.760\nIt was consensual, he says.\n\n01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:41.760\nIt was consensual?\n\n01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:42.760\nYeah.\n\n01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:44.760\nSee, one through three would have been non-consensual.\n\n01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:45.760\nI rolled a four through six.\n\n01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:46.760\nSo it was barely.\n\n01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:47.760\nYeah.\n\n01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:48.760\nBarely consensual.\n\n01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:52.760\nIt was, it was critical, it wasn't

maybe a man sized hole in the\n\n01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:14.760\ntrees.\n\n01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:15.760\nOkay.\n\n01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:16.760\nWhich, which man?\n\n01:23:16.760 -->

from above.\n\n01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.760\nHey, torch!\n\n01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:52.760\nGot it!\n\n01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:53.760\nAll right.\n\n01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:56.760\nYou grab the torch and hold it aloft.\n\n01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:57.760\nThanks, Christopher.\n\n01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:58.760\nYep.\n\n01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:06.260\nThe room is pretty narrow, but you can make out what seems to be a square in the far\n\n01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:07.260\nwall.\n\n01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:12.600\nTry not to fuck it.\n\n01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:16.280\nYou know square peg, round hole, that kind of thing?\n\n01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:19.760\nI should mention, I'm all fucked out from last week.\n\n01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:24.360\nYou also see several perfectly spherical fist size holes perforating the wall.\n\n01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:27.800\nI fuck, I fuck one of those holes.\n\n01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:36.840\nThe first one feels good, not the second one feels slightly bitey.\n\n01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.720\nIt's too loose, man.\n\n01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.320\nYou're not that big.\n\n01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.320\nYou can fist it.\n\n01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.320\nI said fist size holes, man.\n\n01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:44.320\nOkay.\n\n01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.240\nI put my fist in the, I fist the hole?\n\n01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.240\nI'm not suggesting that.\n\n01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:48.240\nWhat am I, gross?\n\n01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:49.240\nWhat is happening?\n\n01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:56.760\nI, look, I see a hole shaped like a fist.\n\n01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:59.360\nI put my fist in the hole.\n\n01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.360\nOkay.\n\n01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.360\nYeah.\n\n01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.360\nFists in the hole, dude.\n\n01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:12.040\nI, and then I, I, I rotate it 30 degrees to the right, then 40 degrees to the left.\n\n01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.040\nI don't know.\n\n01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.040\nI hear the far offset.\n\n01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.040\nNo, nothing happens.\n\n01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:16.040\nOkay.\n\n01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:19.960\nI take my fist out of the hole.\n\n01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:20.960\nOkay.\n\n01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:21.960\nHey guys, come on then.\n\n01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:24.000\nThere's a bunch of fist holes down here.\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.480\nI think you might have rope.\n\n01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:26.480\nYeah.\n\n01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.480\nI mean, I have a rope guys.\n\n01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:28.480\nYeah.\n\n01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:29.480\nWe can use it to climb down.\n\n01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.480\nYeah.\n\n01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.480\nYou want to climb down?\n\n01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:32.480\nYeah.\n\n01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.480\nYeah.\n\n01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.480\nYou want to climb into the darkness below.\n\n01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.880\nYou meet with Quark in the mud.\n\n01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:38.840\nI use my staff, that staff with the button on it.\n\n01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:41.000\nUsing that staff with the button on it.\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.320\nYou climb into the hole where the people are.\n\n01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.320\nHey guys.\n\n01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.320\nI.\n\n01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.320\nDid you use the staff with the button on it?\n\n01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:48.320\nYeah.\n\n01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:49.320\nYeah.\n\n01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:51.320\nI press the button on stick it, you know.\n\n01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.040\nThat's the trick.\n\n01:26:53.040 --> 01:27:02.440\nI, I use, I take one of my sacs and I, I throw it at the bottom of the hole.\n\n01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.440\nAnd then I jump on the sack.\n\n01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.440\nLike a landing pad.\n\n01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.440\nOkay.\n\n01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.840\nOh, is it, is the dirt an issue here?\n\n01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:08.840\nI had rope.\n\n01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:09.840\nYou could climb down.\n\n01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:10.840\nOh, okay.\n\n01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:11.840\nAnd I a pole.\n\n01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:12.840\nCan I use, can I use Chris's rope?\n\n01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:13.840\nOh, thank you so much.\n\n01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:14.840\nYeah.\n\n01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:15.840\nOf course.\n\n01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:16.840\nThank you.\n\n01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:17.840\nThank you.\n\n01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:18.840\nThank you.\n\n01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:19.840\nThank you.\n\n01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:20.840\nThe rope, the ropes for everyone.\n\n01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:21.840\nYeah.\n\n01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:25.000\nAlso, there's free feed of mud down here.\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nI landed pretty softly.\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.240\nYou can just kind of, you can kind of, kind of just hop on in here.\n\n01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:34.240\nLike, I mean, I have rope, I will happily use your rope.\n\n01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.440\nGuys, I examine the, the square at the, at the end of the thing.\n\n01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.880\nIt appears to be some sort of wooden board.\n\n01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:43.080\nIt's caked with mud and is stuck fast to the wall.\n\n01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.000\nI detect magic on it.\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000\nIt is non-magic.\n\n01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nOh, this isn't magic.\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.800\nUh, does anybody have any thief, thiefy, like, detect traps?\n\n01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:54.800\nDetect traps.\n\n01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.000\nShould I do detect traps?\n\n01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.480\nI mean, you can, you can look for traps totally.\n\n01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:59.880\nAll right.\n\n01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:04.000\nI look for traps totally.\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000\nLooking for traps.\n\n01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.440\nYou fail to find anything.\n\n01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:09.800\nThose holes are kind of suspicious, but you don't think they're traps.\n\n01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:10.800\nHow many holes are there?\n\n01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:11.800\nThere's, there's several.\n\n01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:18.240\nI mean, there's, you will, you, if you counted them, you think it would be a waste of time.\n\n01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:24.600\nI count the holes.\n\n01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.920\nNever seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight.\n\n01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:29.520\nThere are 76 holes.\n\n01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.520\nGuys.\n\n01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:31.520\n76?\n\n01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:35.200\nFist holes led the big.\n\n01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.040\nI think a bunch of people just came down here.\n\n01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:41.400\nI think the first guy saw the wooden board, detected traps and magic on it and nothing\n\n01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.160\nhappened and he was like, fuck, what do I do?\n\n01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:46.520\nAnd he punched and then, and then whatever happened to him happened and then the next\n\n01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.320\nguy came down and said, why is there a fist size hole?\n\n01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.320\nIt's got to be significant.\n\n01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:52.160\nAnd then he punched like a bunch and then that kept happening.\n\n01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:57.200\n76 guys.\n\n01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.640\nSo I kick, I kick the wooden square.\n\n01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:01.600\nI kick it.\n\n01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:04.040\nWhat's your strength?\n\n01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:10.160\nTwo million, nine, minus one ability modifier.\n\n01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:11.160\nYeah.\n\n01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:14.160\nNine is a negative modifier, kicking the board.\n\n01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:16.800\nYou feel it give a little bit, but it doesn't budge.\n\n01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.160\nI kick it too.\n\n01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:20.160\nWhat's your strength?\n\n01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:23.320\nI'm 18 with a plus four ability modifier.\n\n01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:25.000\nYou kick it too.\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.760\nIt bends it a bit better, but not much shit.\n\n01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:30.120\nCan I call down a Coco?\n\n01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.120\nShe is a horse.\n\n01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.120\nOh yeah.\n\n01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:35.120\nCan I fortify the wood?\n\n01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.960\nWhat are you going to do?\n\n01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.960\nWe're trying to break it.\n\n01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:38.960\nYeah.\n\n01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:39.960\nOh, I'm sorry.\n\n01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.960\nWell, I don't think Coco can fit down here.\n\n01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:45.640\nI summon, really, she can't get it because she kicks so hard.\n\n01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:46.640\nOkay.\n\n01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:47.640\nYeah.\n\n01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:48.640\nTell me about it.\n\n01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:49.640\nFine.\n\n01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:50.640\nShe liked it.\n\n01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:51.640\nIt's fine.\n\n01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:58.600\nShe was trying to kick you off.\n\n01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.160\nThat's nothing to be proud of.\n\n01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.560\nI like it.\n\n01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:02.560\nI like it.\n\n01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:03.560\nI like it.\n\n01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:04.560\nI like it and I'm empowered.\n\n01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:05.560\nIt's fine.\n\n01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:06.560\nI have a pretty high strength thing.\n\n01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.560\nI have 13 plus one.\n\n01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:08.560\nOkay.\n\n01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.120\nDo you want to try and also kick it?\n\n01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.960\nDo I have some sort of battering ram?\n\n01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:13.960\nI mean, you don't.\n\n01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:14.960\nYou have.\n\n01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:15.960\nLet's see.\n\n01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:16.960\nI have an open lock thing.\n\n01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:19.800\nCan I, is there a, is it a lock of some sort?\n\n01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.000\nYou could look for a lock.\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.040\nIf you fail to see a lock, it just appears to be like sealed with some sort of wax or\n\n01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:29.680\nmaybe glue to this wall.\n\n01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:33.880\nI listened very carefully to the, to the wood, like I put my ear to it.\n\n01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:35.480\nI can disable device.\n\n01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:36.480\nYeah.\n\n01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:37.480\nOh, go first.\n\n01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:38.480\nGo ahead.\n\n01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:43.400\nYou hear the faint sounds of hissing coming from some other floor far off.\n\n01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.400\nSnakes.\n\n01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.520\nWhy did it have to be snakes?\n\n01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:50.720\nSpencer has no idea.\n\n01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:53.880\nYou know, I saw, I saw the first, the first Indiana Jones.\n\n01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:54.880\nOh, what'd you think?\n\n01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:55.880\nIt was good.\n\n01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:58.240\nIt was good.\n\n01:30:58.240 --> 01:30:59.240\nIt wasn't like original.\n\n01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:02.480\nAnd I mean, it was, but it wasn't that original.\n\n01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:07.560\nAfter seeing all of television, biting it off for like years, like you've seen literally\n\n01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:10.120\nevery element represented in other things.\n\n01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:11.120\nThat's like easy.\n\n01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:12.120\nThat's what I watch.\n\n01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:13.120\nEasy Rider.\n\n01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:14.120\nI'm like, what the fuck is this?\n\n01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:15.120\nYeah.\n\n01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:16.120\nAre they awesome?\n\n01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.920\nBut it was like, it was like, it was, it was seeing all of it like throughout time.\n\n01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:19.920\nI don't know.\n\n01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:20.920\nIt was good.\n\n01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:24.840\nYou know, you saw the movie, where I live.\n\n01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:28.320\nWhat did you think of my hosting when you were watching the movie?\n\n01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.160\nDid you like it when you was my hosting good?\n\n01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.160\nIt was great.\n\n01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:33.160\nCan I?\n\n01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.160\nI really loved the party, Aaron.\n\n01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:35.160\nThat didn't sound good either.\n\n01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:36.160\nI don't know how to.\n\n01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:37.160\nNo, never.\n\n01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:38.160\nYou know what?\n\n01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:39.160\nSpencer, just throw it away.\n\n01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.160\nJust putting too much into it.\n\n01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:41.160\nI really like the party.\n\n01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.160\nWait, what?\n\n01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.160\nOh.\n\n01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:44.160\nJust throw it away.\n\n01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:45.160\nYou're thinking about it too much.\n\n01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:50.160\nI had a party.\n\n01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.160\nNo.\n\n01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.160\nI actually tried.\n\n01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:53.160\nCan I?\n\n01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:54.160\nThis is not going to work.\n\n01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.160\nI'll kick it.\n\n01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:56.160\nFine.\n\n01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:58.660\nI think we're doing two different bits.\n\n01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:01.760\nI kick it also, and I have 13 plus one strength.\n\n01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:02.760\nOkay.\n\n01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:03.760\nSorry.\n\n01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:04.760\nI forgot everything.\n\n01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:05.760\nWe're just kicking a wooden thing right now.\n\n01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:06.760\nYou kick it.\n\n01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:07.760\nYou see it splinter.\n\n01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:08.760\nThat's what Coco said about that.\n\n01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:09.760\nYou think it's almost broken.\n\n01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:10.760\nGuys, it's almost broken.\n\n01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:14.760\nBy the way, I heard hissing on the other side of it.\n\n01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:15.760\nShit.\n\n01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:26.760\nI use a rapid fire shot, and I shoot two arrows at the burning hands.\n\n01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:30.760\nMy mom's here.\n\n01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:33.160\nHe's broken hearted over wanting you to use something.\n\n01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:34.160\nI used two arrows.\n\n01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.760\nI shoot them at either side of the frame.\n\n01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:39.760\nThey strike the board and plant fast in the board.\n\n01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.760\nI think you just made the board stronger.\n\n01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:42.760\nYeah.\n\n01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:43.760\nSorry.\n\n01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.760\nI got yelled at by burning hands.\n\n01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.760\nCan I cast burning hands on the board?\n\n01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:53.760\nCasting burning hands on the board is consumed in flames.\n\n01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.760\nYou see a hole about three feet in diameter.\n\n01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:59.760\nIt looks like it goes some distance.\n\n01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.760\nDoes my light spell have a range to it?\n\n01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:03.760\nCan I cast a light?\n\n01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:07.760\nYou cast it on an object, and it'll make it glow like a torch.\n\n01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:12.760\nI take one of my arrows, put a light on it, and I'll shoot it.\n\n01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:13.760\nNicely done.\n\n01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:16.760\nYou have arrows.\n\n01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:23.760\nYeah, I mean, I have arrows, I have a hit song, I've got a couple.\n\n01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:28.760\nThe hit song sort of arrowed to the top of the charts back in the day.\n\n01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:32.760\nI cast light on the tip of one of Christopher's arrows.\n\n01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:35.760\nAnd I then, in turn, shoot that arrow.\n\n01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:36.760\nThrough the hole, right?\n\n01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:38.760\nThrough the hole, yeah.\n\n01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:42.760\nBehind him, I like mime it.\n\n01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:43.760\nVery sadly.\n\n01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:47.760\nThat was me that did it, not her.\n\n01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:50.760\nBut I mean, through my mime encouragement.\n\n01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:51.760\nYeah, awesome.\n\n01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:57.760\nI watched this all happen and do a camera take and go.\n\n01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:02.760\nAnd then Coco looks at him and takes her a hoe and goes...\n\n01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.760\nI fuck Coco again.\n\n01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:06.760\nNo, you're in the hole.\n\n01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:08.760\nCoco's up there.\n\n01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.760\nI climb the rope and fuck Coco.\n\n01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:12.760\nNo, I took the rope down, it's my rope.\n\n01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:15.760\nI take your Sharpie staff and I climb the staff.\n\n01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.760\nHe's just jangling for the rope.\n\n01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:21.760\nSanctuary!\n\n01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:24.760\nI shit on the ground for no reason.\n\n01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:27.760\nHey, how about the lighted arrow that I shot?\n\n01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.760\nFiring the lighted arrow through the hole.\n\n01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:30.760\nLet's focus.\n\n01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:32.760\nYeah, but me fucking Coco's a B story.\n\n01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:33.760\nLet's get back to the A story.\n\n01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:36.760\nFor a brief moment, you can see the floor being lit up.\n\n01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:39.760\nThere seems to be a mosaic scrawled across the floor.\n\n01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:42.760\nIt's big and green, but you're not sure what it's representing.\n\n01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:46.760\nBecause it glows and you're shooting it and it plants in the wall.\n\n01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:50.760\nSo it plants in the far wall and you can see what appears to be a wooden door.\n\n01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.760\nAs well as a stone lever jetting out of the wall.\n\n01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:55.760\nDo we see any snakes?\n\n01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.760\nYou don't see any snakes.\n\n01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.760\nI pull the stone lever.\n\n01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:03.760\nYou are in a different room.\n\n01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.760\nWe gotta walk in.\n\n01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:10.760\nAs a gnome, am I small enough to squeeze through that small hole?\n\n01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:11.760\nI think all of us can.\n\n01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:14.760\nYou can all go through, but not at the same time.\n\n01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:16.760\nBut Chris de Burgh has the power to detect traps.\n\n01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:17.760\nYeah.\n\n01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:18.760\nI'll go in.\n\n01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:20.760\nNot in a 4-chan sense.\n\n01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:23.760\nI go in.\n\n01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:29.760\nI go in and I detect traps.\n\n01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.760\nThat was a low roll, wasn't it?\n\n01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:35.760\nYou rolled an 18, so that's pretty good.\n\n01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:36.760\nI don't know.\n\n01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:39.760\nDo you see, you should have a search check.\n\n01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:41.760\nDo you have on the skills?\n\n01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:42.760\nIs there a number there?\n\n01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:43.760\nYeah, 9.\n\n01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:44.760\nAwesome.\n\n01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:45.760\n10.\n\n01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:46.760\nIt's 9.\n\n01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:48.760\nIt's still pretty good.\n\n01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:52.760\nSurveying the landscape, you see a few oddities.\n\n01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:55.760\nThere's some scrape marks on the walls.\n\n01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:00.760\nYou can see a few cracks in the ruins where roots poke out of the walls,\n\n01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.760\nbut they seem to be cut off.\n\n01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.760\nIt definitely seems like there might be some trap about,\n\n01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:06.760\nbut you can't determine its true nature.\n\n01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:09.760\nGuys, I'm getting a weird vibe here.\n\n01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.760\nThere's vines that are out of the walls.\n\n01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:15.760\nSomebody did cut the vines, but it seemed like they were attack vines.\n\n01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:18.760\nLook where the vines are cut and see if there's openings.\n\n01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:22.760\nThat penitent man will kneel from Indiana Judge 3.\n\n01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:26.760\nAre they cut because something comes out of the walls?\n\n01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:29.760\nI'm just saying.\n\n01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:33.760\nYou can just see only the very bits of them come out of the walls.\n\n01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:37.760\nAlmost as soon as they come out of the walls, that's where they're shorn off.\n\n01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:39.760\nRight, so something comes through here like a dick of a...\n\n01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.760\nI have a trap sense too.\n\n01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:43.760\nCan I add onto that?\n\n01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:45.760\nYou can search for trap.\n\n01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:46.760\nI search for traps.\n\n01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.760\nYou don't find a new trap?\n\n01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:49.760\nShit.\n\n01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:52.760\nWhy don't you go fuck a horse?\n\n01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:56.760\nYou know what? I don't mind if I do.\n\n01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:59.760\nAlright, let me see if I have a spell.\n\n01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.760\nEverybody back up out of here.\n\n01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:06.760\nI think I have a spell that I can pull that lever from a remote distance.\n\n01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:10.760\nAnd if I'm wrong about that, then I will have wasted your time.\n\n01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:13.760\nSo Chris, do you have a lot of arrows?\n\n01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:16.760\nYeah, I mean I got mage hand, right?\n\n01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:19.760\nOkay, everybody back up, back up.\n\n01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:22.760\nIf you have to take a shit, go take a shit, smoke them if you got them.\n\n01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:26.760\nAlright, everybody get out of the line of fire of this hole.\n\n01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:32.760\nI'm going to cast mage hand on the lever from safely outside the entrance to that whole tunnel.\n\n01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:34.760\nAnd pull that lever.\n\n01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:35.760\nYou pull the lever.\n\n01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:40.760\nAt first nothing happens, but then you see movement on the wooden door far down the hall.\n\n01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:44.760\nIt rumbles and then falls forward.\n\n01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:50.760\nIt hits the ground and shatters part of the mosaic, causing a few cracks to run down its length.\n\n01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:55.760\nYou see behind the wall there is no doorway, but instead just a dead end.\n\n01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:58.760\nThat's confusing.\n\n01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:02.760\nThis lever was a decoy lever, I think.\n\n01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.760\nWe're back in puzzle world.\n\n01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:07.760\nYeah, we're running a lot.\n\n01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:10.760\nCan we examine the mosaic before we do it?\n\n01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.760\nYeah, we look at the mosaic.\n\n01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:15.760\nAt this point, only kumels in this room.\n\n01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:19.760\nOh, fuck, you didn't wait for me to leave until you pulled the lever.\n\n01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.760\nI said everybody get back, everybody get back.\n\n01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:22.760\nWhy didn't you hear you?\n\n01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:26.760\nOkay, so wait, you are now back in the room that you guys are in?\n\n01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:33.760\nYeah, when he was like, everyone get back, I went back into the main standard room.\n\n01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:35.760\nI can go back in and look at the mosaic.\n\n01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:37.760\nOkay, so now you want to go back in and look at the mosaic?\n\n01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.760\nYeah, I just want to see what the...\n\n01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:44.760\nIt's like there's a giant green serpentine, like perhaps a dragon.\n\n01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.760\nDefinitely a dragon, I take that back.\n\n01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:49.760\nGuys, it's definitely a dragon.\n\n01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:50.760\nWhat?\n\n01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:55.760\nAt first I thought it was like a snake kind of thing, but it's definitely a dragon.\n\n01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:01.760\nIts mouth is open wide in aggression, and you can see its mouth is just an entire slab of ruby crystal.\n\n01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:04.760\nQuirk should fuck it.\n\n01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:08.760\nThere's a ruby crystal, can I remove the ruby crystal?\n\n01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:09.760\nDo you want to?\n\n01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:14.760\nAt this point you're still like near these guys, right?\n\n01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.760\nI think we're running along.\n\n01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.760\nWe should come to a cliffhanger here.\n\n01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.760\nWell, let's let this play out.\n\n01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:22.760\nWe came out at 8, 10.\n\n01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:28.760\nIt's 10 now, that means we've put these people through worse.\n\n01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:29.760\nWhat are they going to do?\n\n01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:30.760\nComplain?\n\n01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:31.760\nI can't...\n\n01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:34.760\nYeah, that is exactly what they could do.\n\n01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:35.760\nHere, I'll fix it.\n\n01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:38.760\nLadies and gentlemen, Eric Eidl's here.\n\n01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:39.760\nNo, he's not.\n\n01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:40.760\nHe's not.\n\n01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:43.760\nSorry, I thought that would bolster them for a second.\n\n01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:50.760\nThat would be really funny if Eric Eidl did come out then, and he was just sitting on it like, we're going to go really long.\n\n01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.760\nBut he's been here every week.\n\n01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:53.760\nYeah.\n\n01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:56.760\nHe just comes with me every right now.\n\n01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:58.760\nHe's the new me.\n\n01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:01.760\nHe comes up to me when I'm like three in the morning, I'm at Del Taco, and they're like,\n\n01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:05.760\nsir, could you please make up your mind, I'm like, you know what, Eric Eidl's here, and he comes up.\n\n01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:06.760\nHello?\n\n01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:07.760\nThe guy's like, I don't.\n\n01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:08.760\nDan wants a taco.\n\n01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:09.760\nDan wants a taco.\n\n01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:14.760\nDan wants a taco now.\n\n01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:18.760\nThat was omaji and mocking at the same time.\n\n01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:21.760\nSo can I remove, should I try and remove the ruby?\n\n01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:22.760\nDo it, Christopher.\n\n01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:23.760\nRemove it.\n\n01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:24.760\nOh, it's a red ruby.\n\n01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:27.760\nThis is my specialty.\n\n01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:29.760\nRuby in red.\n\n01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:31.760\nWho's that?\n\n01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:33.760\nGrabbing at the ruby.\n\n01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.760\nYou pry with all your might.\n\n01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:40.760\nAt the second you begin prying, you hear a rumbling sound behind you.\n\n01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:42.760\nGuys.\n\n01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:44.760\nGuys.\n\n01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:46.760\nYou're the only one in the room at this point.\n\n01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:51.760\nGuys!\n\n01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:57.760\nTurning around behind you, you see that a large stone wall is rumbled down, blocking your exit.\n\n01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.760\nOh.\n\n01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:03.760\nAt the same time, you feel the giant ruby you've been grabbing.\n\n01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:07.760\nMove and jiggle a little bit, as if it's trying to pull itself free.\n\n01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:11.760\nAs if it's trying to pull itself free from my hands, or it's from the thing it says?\n\n01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:12.760\nFrom what you're doing.\n\n01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.760\nI spoke dumb.\n\n01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:16.760\nSo it's trying to regain...\n\n01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:20.760\nYou're making progress, pulling the ruby out of the thing, but it's not out yet.\n\n01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:23.760\nI dived through into the room with him.\n\n01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:25.760\nNo, it's blocked.\n\n01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.760\nI was slashing with my sword in a barbarian rage.\n\n01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:29.760\nI tried to make it through to the room with Christopher.\n\n01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:32.760\nOkay, so you strike the rock surface with your sword.\n\n01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.760\nYes.\n\n01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:37.760\nFeels useless.\n\n01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:39.760\nI'm like, I'm digging through.\n\n01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.760\nI'm trying to get my... I tunnel with my sword.\n\n01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.760\nYou make the lightest of scratches.\n\n01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:47.760\nIf I cast knock on it, does knock work on this kind of thing?\n\n01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:49.760\nKnock wouldn't work on this. It's far too heavy.\n\n01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:51.760\nKnock wouldn't work on you.\n\n01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:53.760\nIt's not openable.\n\n01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.760\nSo...\n\n01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:58.760\nSlowly, the wall starts rumbling towards you.\n\n01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.760\nThreatening to crush you against the far...\n\n01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:04.760\nChristopher, get out of there, you son of a bitch!\n\n01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:06.760\nCan they hear me?\n\n01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:09.760\nUm, sure.\n\n01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:12.760\nGuys, these are my last words.\n\n01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:15.760\nLady Enra!\n\n01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:19.760\nCliffhanger!\n\n01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:21.760\nAlright, okay.\n\n01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:24.760\nOh, no.\n\n01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:27.760\nOkay.\n\n01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:30.760\nThank you, Aaron.\n\n01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:32.760\nThank you, Camille, not Gianni.\n\n01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:34.760\nThank you, Camille.\n\n01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:36.760\nErin McGathy.\n\n01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.760\nAnd Spencer.\n\n01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:47.760\nThat's a cliffhanger, because now Christopher is just trapped in a crumbling room,\n\n01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.760\nand we're helpless to save him.\n\n01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:55.760\nIt's crazy. I mean, Joseph Campbell would be very proud of us, I think.\n\n01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:57.760\nWhat stage would that be in a story, you think?\n\n01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.760\nI don't know, the belly of the thingamabob.\n\n01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:02.760\nWhat you doing there?\n\n01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.760\nI'm just trying to get tangle-free.\n\n01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:06.760\nAlright, then.\n\n01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:12.760\nLet's bring this ship into the station and talk about what we learned.\n\n01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:15.760\nWhat did you learn?\n\n01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.760\nI don't know.\n\n01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:20.760\nGo with the flow? That's kind of easy to learn.\n\n01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:24.760\nI learn that every week, by having a show that pays nothing,\n\n01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:27.760\nand that I don't care if it goes good or bad.\n\n01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:32.760\nI think the lesson just kind of continues.\n\n01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:36.760\nLike DC Pearson said, this is the reason movies don't continue past the end.\n\n01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:39.760\nAs a hero, I'm kind of done.\n\n01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:42.760\nI like these guys coming here.\n\n01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:47.760\nIf you were really courageous, you would just gently put the mic back in the stand\n\n01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:53.760\nand walk off the stage, and allow that to be the end of the show.\n\n01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:56.760\nI don't know.\n\n01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:12.760\nBut let me ask you one thing.\n\n01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:15.760\nNo, no, that's the part.\n\n01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:19.760\nYou were supposed to just say, the master walks away,\n\n01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:24.760\nand you should just walk away and leave these people with the confidence\n\n01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:29.760\nof knowing that you've done your job.\n\n01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:35.760\nWhat were you going to ask them?\n\n01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:38.760\nWhat if it feels awkward?\n\n01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:44.760\nIt'll feel awkward if you let them know it's awkward.\n\n01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:49.760\nYou know in the old days, the term break a leg comes from not from like actor's superstition,\n\n01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:53.760\nit comes from make it to the end, because bowing, where you break your back leg,\n\n01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:56.760\nlike you kind of bend your leg, that means make it to the end.\n\n01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:00.760\nAnd it's lowering yourself to the audience and saying thank you for coming.\n\n01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:03.760\nSo like if you just did a deep bow to the audience, saying thank you.\n\n01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:07.760\nI thought it came from John Wilkes Booth breaking his leg after shooting the president in the head.\n\n01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:11.760\nNo, he broke an ankle.\n\n01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:19.760\nThat's like your leg.\n\n01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:24.760\nI mean the alternative is that you have to leave these people with some sort of special message.\n\n01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:27.760\nIt's difficult.\n\n01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:30.760\nIt's lonely.\n\n01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:33.760\nYou're all by yourself out there.\n\n01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:36.760\nPeople pay $10.\n\n01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.760\nSpencer drove from CME Valley to be here.\n\n01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:45.760\nThere's a woman here from Estonia tonight.\n\n01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:46.760\nIs that true?\n\n01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:55.760\nNo.\n\n01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:00.760\nIn the beginning, there was nothing.\n\n01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:05.760\nNothing had an eternity to decide that nothing was worse than something.\n\n01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:08.760\nNothing split into a million somethings,\n\n01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:10.760\nAKA everything.\n\n01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:13.760\nYou were part of that everything.\n\n01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:23.760\nSo was the person next to you.\n\n01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:26.760\nNo matter who fires you,\n\n01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:32.760\nno matter whose laundry is left in your apartment complex is drier.\n\n01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:35.760\nHalf dry.\n\n01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:42.760\nNo matter who writes notes on your company's refrigerator's great coupon saying touch and die.\n\n01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:50.760\nAnd then writes notes on the door of the fridge saying everything in here after Friday will be thrown away.\n\n01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:56.760\nNo matter how many recycling bins you can't tell from regular bins.\n\n01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:01.760\nNo matter how many pains and your nuts and your kidney and your forehead and the back of your neck,\n\n01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:06.760\nno matter how much hair you see in your shower drain.\n\n01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:16.760\nNo matter what you look like from the side in the mirror after you take a shit.\n\n01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:22.760\nNo matter what some crazy lady said about you that came back to you after you went out with her for a week\n\n01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:28.760\nand then you found out she said something weird about you because you ran into someone at Kmart.\n\n01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:39.760\nYou are a citizen of Harmontown.\n\n01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:41.760\nYou belong.\n\n01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:44.760\nYou belong if you're human.\n\n01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:50.760\nYou belong if you leave your isms and your itises at the door.\n\n01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:59.760\nI've never seen a sight that didn't look better looking back.\n\n01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:04.760\nThank you for coming to Harmontown tonight.\n\n01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:14.760\nI've been Gaith, Ryan Ridley, Erin McGathy, Kumail Nanjiani, Spencer Crittenden.\n\n01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:25.760\nAgain, I'm Jeff Davis and you may hear Dan Harmon, everyone.\n\n01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:45.760\nSee Marvin, everybody, singing their songs. I knew closing.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.002s"],"str_size":[179786]}
