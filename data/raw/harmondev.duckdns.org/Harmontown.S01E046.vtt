00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hey, Meltdown! How's it going tonight?

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
You seem like an audience that doesn't give a shit about false darts.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
Well, guess what? You've come to a magical place where anything can happen, and I always will.

00:19.000 --> 00:36.000
So, welcome to the stage for the second time! Dan Harmon! Black Sabbath the Floor! The Double!

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
Uh, yes, it's a little double-side. We did it from Goldberg, a little satanic Goldberg in the...

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Tonight's about being comfortable with chaos.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
I was sitting in the back room and I was thinking, like, I don't have anything.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm going to run out like a dish rag from the Oscars.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
This will be broadcasting a little bit after it's relevant.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
We don't have to talk about Seth MacFarlane all night, but because then a little air later,

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
and people will be like, oh, fresh.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Was it real quick? Because I watched 45 minutes of it, and that was quite enough for me.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
What is your take away from the Oscars?

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
You know, I didn't look up, I didn't see what the Zeitgeist, or the Gestalt, or the Hormenheimer,

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
was about the whole thing, but I assume, I'm going to go ahead and guess if I was a betting man,

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
that it would be mixed bag, which I think is what Ryan Ridley said this morning when he came in to Rick and Morty.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Mixed bag, like, yeah, it seemed like, I mean, in the world of Oscars,

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
you really have to close your eyes and ask yourself, what's the ultimate Oscars,

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
aside from the one Hugh Jackman hosted that I wrote.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
You wrote the whole Oscars?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Well, I wrote the opening thing.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
You know what Schrab just told me a couple of days ago, said,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
I never told you this because it was going down during the whole Chevy debacle,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
and I figured I didn't want to put another nickel in you,

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
or give you any reason to get any embarrassing public shenanigans,

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
and there was this article after the Billy Crystal Oscars,

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
where some snarky blog, like, printed an article that said,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
here's the 10 things you have to do to save the Oscars.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Number one, get rid of Bruce Valanche,

02:21.000 --> 02:28.000
and bring the guys back that wrote that, Hugh Jackman opening, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Not a hero, the person doing this, I mean, who cares what his opinion is,

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
and what are good Oscars, who cares.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
But in the comment section under it, Schrab tells me,

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Bruce Valanche signs in,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
and says, according to Schrab,

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
so now this is kind of urban legend because I'm quoting Schrab,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
who's giving me hearsay from this comment section,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
but something akin to,

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm very sorry that you feel I'm past my prime,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I did my best, you know, those guys,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
we all worked on that opening together,

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
and they're the only ones that won the Emmy,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
because they were the ones that were credited for it,

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
but lie, lie, like lie,

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
180 degrees from the truth, lie.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Now do people know who Bruce Valanche is in the audience?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah, I think he's kind of famous in the audience.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Are you clapping because you know who he is,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
or clapping because you're fans of Bruce Valanche?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I think he's the choice.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Clap if you're a big Bruce Valanche fan.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
I mean, he's on Hollywood Squares or was at one point,

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
he was drawn in The Simpsons,

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
I mean, he's an iconic non-icon, you know?

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Like for 15, 20 years, God knows what,

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
he's been writing on the Oscars,

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
but I just thought that was a weird,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
that's a weird thing because it's like,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
in the world of writing and TV and stuff,

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
there's always room for all kinds of revisionist,

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
kind of like, well, you know, Chris McKenna came up with that joke,

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
but really it was my idea, kind of thing,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
it's like, you forget, you work in collaborative environments,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
it's like, it's very easy to forget,

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
especially if you're actually really good in collaborative,

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
you totally forget what you wrote and what someone else wrote.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
But that is not, we walked into the first day of working with that guy,

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
with a finished thing, because it was songs and stuff,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
and there were sets built that Rob made on a cardboard,

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
so for him to say that in a comment section,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I was like, I thought...

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Dan, if you could say one word to Bruce Valanche?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Right now.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Liar.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Like weird liar.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
If I get two, I get two?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Weird liar.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Three?

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Like weird, weird liar.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Weird lying, weird liar.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I would build out from there,

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
until it was a buckyball of just calling him a fucking liar.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
Like, just weird, with question marks all over it,

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
going like, why?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
I want to know.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
If you're a sociopath, then dress differently.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Like, if you're just an automaton,

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
that's only like this Machiavelli on the ends justifies the means,

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
then why, where did you arrive at Bruce Valanche as a persona?

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Like, how is that effective?

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
And I just like, honestly, man...

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Was he cool to work with?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Was he a good guy?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
No, no.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
No.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Like, and I'm not, you know, hey look,

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
I'm notoriously apparently not cool to work with.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
I have all kinds of stuff to argue with about that,

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
but I mean, I think that the people that say that I'm hard to work with

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
are themselves hard to work with.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
I think that they're just bummed out

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
and they grab for the edge of the pool that's there,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
which is like, oh, you know, there's a bunch of people over here

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
that also were made to feel stupid and untalented.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
You know what, he's crazy.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Oh, he's crazy? He's crazy.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Hey, everybody's crazy.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
You know, there's a bunch of really awesome people

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
in the middle of that pool hanging out

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
and crushing brews and browing down.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Is that how they talk in the middle of the pool?

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah, that's where you have the inflatable bunker,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
you know, with the squirt gun mounted in it.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
It's like, we're having fun out there playing chicken and...

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Crushing brews?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Yeah.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Anyway, it's just weird, just weird.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
I don't know, brews play out somehow if you receive this message somehow.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
And he will, apparently, because he reads comment sections on...

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Yeah, yeah.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
I mean, I think he's a... I put the word image-conscious in giant quotes.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Everybody hashtag Bruce Valanche.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Let's try to...

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
I'm inviting you down, Bruce, to explain yourself.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Defend yourself, sir.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
Granted, I will say this in his defense right now preemptively,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
that I did not read the source material that Rob was referring to.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
But, I mean, and I don't really want to go digging back for conflict, but...

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Let's do it.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Let's do it.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Bruce, come down.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
Bruce, come down and let's talk about your lying liar-ness.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Speaking of which, did we ever get...

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
There was a chance that Chevy was going to show up on the tour at some point.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
He never did.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Yeah, I guess.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
There's always a chance Chevy will show up.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
But that was the same as on community.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Like...

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
That was the whole point.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
There was always a flip of a coin, whether he emerged from the trailer,

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
or what his hair would look like, or what would be on his face,

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
and sometimes he'd be happy, and sometimes he'd be sad,

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
and sometimes he'd be angry.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Can we call it right now?

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Every time we do that stuff, and it's like...

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
Vulture, HuffPo, TMZ, they extract without context,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
and it's like, I don't know.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I saw WorldWeary.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
I have no reason to be WorldWeary.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
The world gave me a blowjob.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
Was there any fallout, I mean, not fallout,

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
or any reaction to when Jason Sudeikis called him as Joe Biden?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
He called back.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
He left a message saying,

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
What was that?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Was that Danny Pooty?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
What was that?

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
And then I explained to him, I said,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
No, that was Jason Sudeikis from SNL,

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
and SNL, Saturday Night Live.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
No, I'm kidding.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
I'm kidding.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
But I wouldn't be surprised.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
That would be to his credit.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
SNL, they adopted that sometime during my life.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
He would remember it.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Got KFC.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Yeah.

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
But he pitched me a TV show idea.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
But we talked about this.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I'm WorldWeary, man.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Why are you so weary?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Well, it's Sunday.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
It's after the Oscars, as we record this,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I'm just like, you know...

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
You just hung over?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
We tied one on that night.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
We played catchphrase to like 5 in the morning.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
How'd that go?

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
I think I won.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Aaron just kept saying,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Oh, we're playing to 20, we're playing to 30,

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
we're playing to 40.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
She just likes to play.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
She just likes to play until I get mad.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
She's playing a larger game.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Catch fight.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
She's catching fights in a little jar.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
No, it's a fun game, but, you know,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
it's 5 in the morning and, you know...

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
It's like that game in Indiana Jones

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
that the...

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
What's her name is playing with the shot glasses,

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
you know, it's like...

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Catchphrase.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah, yeah, catchphrase is like that.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Because there's like four people around a table

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
and there's always the first person that's like...

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
that just stops, you know, their brain stops

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
being able to participate in catchphrase.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Like they can't figure out what the things are.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
They just go,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Okay, umpire.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
The word is umpire.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
The other person says, you lose.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
It's a dumb catchphrase story.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
That's a minute, 11.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
You won't believe it.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
Dan tells all.

09:46.000 --> 09:52.000
Bruce Willis was right.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Um, anyways.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Is Ryan Ridley here in the audience?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
All right.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Hey, come up here.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Come up here.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Our next guest is Ryan Ridley.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Oh, shit.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Ryan Ridley.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
Ryan is a long time collaborator of mine.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
And he works over at the Rick and Morty offices right now,

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
our adult swim show.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
We're about halfway through the run here, script wise.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Yeah.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
And I told you if you came to the show,

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
you could come up on stage.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
It's the only way I can get people to come.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Yeah.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
So, Ryan Ridley.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Ryan Ridley.

Ryan Ridley.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Ryan Ridley.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.440
so that makes you handsome compared to-

11:02.440 --> 11:03.720
I have brown hair and brown eyes.

11:03.720 --> 11:04.560
Yeah.

11:04.560 --> 11:06.400
Beautiful, dreamy, endless brown eyes.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.240
Yeah.

11:07.240 --> 11:09.160
I notice you're staring into them a lot at work.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.000
Yeah.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.040
I got Dan, what were you gonna say about the story,

11:11.040 --> 11:11.880
and then-

11:11.880 --> 11:12.720
Ah, okay.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.040
I was kissing you by a crystal blue Italian stream.

11:15.040 --> 11:15.880
Yeah.

11:15.880 --> 11:16.720
Yeah.

11:16.720 --> 11:21.040
How's it going, working for me?

11:21.040 --> 11:22.640
How hard am I to work with?

11:27.480 --> 11:29.760
You know, we had a little dust up,

11:29.760 --> 11:31.680
but other than that, it's pretty good.

11:31.680 --> 11:32.720
You had a dust up?

11:32.720 --> 11:33.560
Yeah.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.920
Well, I went on tour, and I came back,

11:34.920 --> 11:38.880
and I was saying a couple of outlines,

11:38.880 --> 11:43.520
needed more work, and then Ryan, who had kind of like-

11:43.520 --> 11:46.640
Ryan started the Chris McKenna over at Rick and Morty.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.200
What's that mean?

11:48.200 --> 11:50.200
Well, Chris McKenna was like my right hand,

11:50.200 --> 11:51.840
the heart of the show, I would say.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.680
I wasn't saying that out of neurosis.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.520
Okay.

11:54.520 --> 11:55.360
Yeah.

11:55.360 --> 12:00.800
And so, you know, he's like,

12:00.800 --> 12:03.320
Chris was the guy that was responsible

12:03.320 --> 12:05.040
in the absence of responsibility.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.920
Justin Roiland, who co-created the show with me,

12:06.920 --> 12:09.880
he's as crazy as I am in different ways.

12:09.880 --> 12:10.720
Yeah.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.000
And you're the point man,

12:12.000 --> 12:13.800
you gotta batten down the hatches.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.880
I'm the Wonder Bread.

12:14.880 --> 12:15.720
Yeah.

12:15.720 --> 12:16.560
You guys are the peanut butter and jelly.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.600
You gotta churn out that stuff.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.080
So, you put a lot of work into an outline

12:21.080 --> 12:22.960
while I was on the road, and I came back and was like,

12:22.960 --> 12:26.840
the outline, you know, I think we need

12:26.840 --> 12:28.160
to take a step back on this one.

12:28.160 --> 12:31.680
And you went, I wish you would have said that a month ago.

12:31.680 --> 12:34.880
And then you started punching a black baby.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.520
Yeah.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.440
Is that true, Ryan?

12:38.440 --> 12:39.280
Is that true?

12:39.280 --> 12:41.240
I wasn't punching it.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.080
Yeah.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.360
Just throttling it.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.640
Not a monster.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.280
But yeah, he's spinning it a little in his direction.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.160
Yeah.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.200
Should I elaborate?

12:52.200 --> 12:54.280
I don't know.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.640
If you want to, I mean, you're the one

12:55.640 --> 12:56.840
who brought up the dust up.

12:56.840 --> 12:57.680
Yeah, I don't know.

12:57.680 --> 12:58.960
I thought that would be something, you know,

12:58.960 --> 13:00.520
I don't know, that's a good angle, right?

13:00.520 --> 13:02.200
Yeah, I guess.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.200
All right, all right, all right.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.040
Dan.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.800
Hey, there's Abed.

13:05.800 --> 13:06.920
Oh, real Abed's here.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.120
Yeah.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.640
Yeah, real Abed's here.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.160
We'll get with him in a minute, I think.

13:11.160 --> 13:12.280
He'd come up here too.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.120
Yeah, yeah.

13:13.120 --> 13:17.240
Dan, do you respect Ryan as an employee, as a co-worker?

13:17.240 --> 13:18.280
Not that I care.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.240
Yeah.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.880
I'm confident enough for myself.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.480
I did Water in Power, Channel 101's best series

13:23.480 --> 13:26.280
in the history of Channel 11 with Ryan.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.840
Yeah.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.600
You know, we wrote many things together

13:30.600 --> 13:32.040
in front of an open laptop.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.760
Like, I don't let a lot of people come around when I'm

13:34.760 --> 13:36.480
actually typing something on a screen.

13:36.480 --> 13:37.720
That's a big thing for me.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.000
It's like pooping.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.280
I felt good.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.200
I felt good to hear that.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.200
Yeah.

13:43.200 --> 13:46.800
I mean, you're very insecure, very conscious of how other people

13:46.800 --> 13:47.880
perceive you.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.960
Well, who here isn't, right?

13:50.960 --> 13:51.460
Ah.

13:54.640 --> 13:58.400
I think maybe I am the Adam Goldberg, if maybe just

13:58.400 --> 14:00.880
a couple of things different in my life happened.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.840
And, you know, because I was a big fan of Dan's.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.680
Like, I want to meet Dan and work with Dan.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.600
And, you know, I don't know.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.520
Makes sense to me.

14:08.520 --> 14:10.320
Yeah.

14:10.320 --> 14:13.480
Ryan Ridley is a legacy comedy personality.

14:13.480 --> 14:19.680
His dad, Mark Ridley, founded and runs the Chicago Comedy

14:19.680 --> 14:20.280
Castle.

14:20.280 --> 14:20.780
Detroit.

14:20.780 --> 14:21.280
Detroit.

14:21.280 --> 14:21.780
Yeah.

14:21.780 --> 14:22.280
Yeah.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.960
Yeah.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.600
Mark Ridley's Comedy Castle.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.520
So when you were growing up, you would, you know,

14:30.520 --> 14:32.440
Tim Allen would be like, you know.

14:32.440 --> 14:33.680
It's a tiger game with him.

14:33.680 --> 14:38.100
Crashin' on the couch after a, you know, weekend-long

14:38.100 --> 14:45.560
coke bender, we had a lot of tools to house.

14:45.560 --> 14:46.200
Yeah.

14:46.200 --> 14:46.440
Yeah.

14:46.440 --> 14:54.240
Like, like little straws and razor blades, those kind of tools.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.400
That's what tool time was back then.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.000
There was always a guy peering over something.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.480
He only saw from your house.

15:00.480 --> 15:05.080
There's this dealer, like, hey, what's going on?

15:05.080 --> 15:07.480
That's the, that's the inside joke of that, of that gag is

15:07.480 --> 15:09.000
that you never see his nose.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.200
It's his deviated septum, sort of a life of cocaine.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.840
It's just a lot running down in front of the fence.

15:14.840 --> 15:19.840
It's based on a guy from Detroit named Sniffer.

15:19.840 --> 15:20.640
Uncle Sniffer.

15:20.640 --> 15:23.120
Uncle Sniffer is a coke dealer.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.000
Yeah.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.880
No one's uncle, really.

15:26.880 --> 15:34.040
So Ryan, your podcast with Justin.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.200
Oh, thank you.

15:35.200 --> 15:35.880
Thank you.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.800
Why are they laughing?

15:37.800 --> 15:39.480
I would actually, I would actually recommend people

15:39.480 --> 15:41.800
listen to Ryan's podcast with Justin Roiland, like Rick

15:41.800 --> 15:43.800
and Morty creator, and sometimes.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.640
Was that a laugh of recognition because of the podcast?

15:46.640 --> 15:48.920
God damn it.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.680
Somebody, somebody clapped on the back or something.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.040
Anybody?

15:53.040 --> 15:54.120
Do I know you?

15:54.120 --> 15:55.040
Are we friends?

15:55.040 --> 15:58.320
Oh, all right, all right.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.400
It's, it's, it's very addictive, a very funny little

16:00.400 --> 16:01.840
personalities that you guys have.

16:01.840 --> 16:02.200
Yeah.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.280
Well, you said you're inspired by it, and that's why you did

16:04.280 --> 16:04.720
this podcast.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.400
Yeah, I probably stole the idea, yeah.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.360
But yeah, yeah.

16:09.360 --> 16:12.560
From you and seeing Proups at Sketch Fest that first year

16:12.560 --> 16:14.200
we went, I think I was like, OK, let's just

16:14.200 --> 16:16.560
start podcasting, whatever.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.240
You had to throw Proups in, too.

16:18.240 --> 16:21.080
You couldn't just gone with us.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.920
You said no neurosis.

16:22.920 --> 16:24.000
I know, Jeff.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.040
It's hard.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.800
All right, so should we, should we, should we bring

16:28.800 --> 16:29.600
Real Abbot up?

16:29.600 --> 16:30.360
Yeah.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.440
All right, Real Abbot.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.720
He's never in a rod up before?

16:32.720 --> 16:33.880
I don't think he's ever been up, no.

16:33.880 --> 16:34.880
Good Lord.

16:34.880 --> 16:35.880
Woo!

16:39.360 --> 16:40.480
Real Abbot.

16:40.480 --> 16:41.880
Is this like it's nice that I moved down?

16:41.880 --> 16:43.360
Is this an Abbot game or an Abbot?

16:43.360 --> 16:47.600
Well, the man who the character Abbot on the community

16:47.600 --> 16:48.880
was based upon.

16:48.880 --> 16:49.880
You were sitting here, right?

16:49.880 --> 16:53.880
Wait, you, you, you, you, you stand here, buddy.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.880
Yeah, OK.

16:55.880 --> 16:56.880
Hello, buddy.

16:56.880 --> 16:57.880
Hi.

16:57.880 --> 16:58.880
Great to be here.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.880
I, I didn't expect to come on stage, but that's fine.

17:00.880 --> 17:01.880
It's all right.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.760
You shouldn't have sat in the exact center of the audience.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.760
That was, that was kind of an idea.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.760
I mean, you almost sat like the.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.760
I was like so worried.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.760
I was like trying to avoid your gaze.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.760
And I knew in a minute, a minute you looked at me,

17:12.760 --> 17:13.760
you would say something.

17:13.760 --> 17:14.760
All right.

17:14.760 --> 17:15.760
So, uh.

17:15.760 --> 17:16.760
I feel like I should sit down.

17:16.760 --> 17:17.760
No, no, no, no.

17:17.760 --> 17:18.760
Stand.

17:18.760 --> 17:19.760
Is that a stable?

17:19.760 --> 17:20.760
No.

17:20.760 --> 17:21.760
That's not stable.

17:21.760 --> 17:22.760
No, you can't stop that.

17:22.760 --> 17:23.760
OK.

17:23.760 --> 17:24.760
Sorry, sorry.

17:24.760 --> 17:25.760
I just, I, I feel like I'm doing stand-up.

17:25.760 --> 17:26.760
Yeah.

17:26.760 --> 17:28.760
Well, no, it's like this is a Freudian thing.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.760
Like he developed this, like, like you face away.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.760
That's the development of that couch.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.760
You don't look at, look at the audience and listen to us.

17:34.760 --> 17:35.760
OK.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.760
We're going to counsel you.

17:36.760 --> 17:37.760
Straight ahead, yeah.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.760
So, Abed, Abed's name is Abed.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.760
That's where I got the idea for the name Abed.

17:41.760 --> 17:47.760
He's also a bit of a, I would call you a pop cultural savant kind of.

17:47.760 --> 17:51.760
But really, it's more, more, more music for you.

17:51.760 --> 17:52.760
I think when you.

17:52.760 --> 17:54.760
No, actually more like television.

17:54.760 --> 17:55.760
Really?

17:55.760 --> 17:58.760
I'm, I'm, I think more in the television and film and music.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.760
Music was like something I dabbled in.

18:00.760 --> 18:01.760
Just like I was bored.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.760
And he knows a ton about it.

18:03.760 --> 18:04.760
So that's just dabbling.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.760
I learned everything and I moved on kind of.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.760
It's like, I've heard enough music.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.760
You can only take so much music, you know.

18:11.760 --> 18:15.760
All right, Abed, Abed, who wrote or who sings this song?

18:15.760 --> 18:16.760
Uh-oh.

18:16.760 --> 18:17.760
I'll bet it this.

18:21.760 --> 18:22.760
Don't help him.

18:22.760 --> 18:23.760
Don't help him.

18:26.760 --> 18:27.760
I want to say this is.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.760
It feels like Led Zeppelin.

18:29.760 --> 18:30.760
Nope.

18:30.760 --> 18:31.760
Deep purple.

18:31.760 --> 18:32.760
Deep purple.

18:32.760 --> 18:33.760
Yeah.

18:33.760 --> 18:34.760
Adam Goldberg got it.

18:34.760 --> 18:35.760
Adam Goldberg got it.

18:35.760 --> 18:36.760
I see.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.760
I was close because of almost famous.

18:38.760 --> 18:39.760
Aren't they both in that movie?

18:39.760 --> 18:40.760
Don't know.

18:40.760 --> 18:41.760
Yeah.

18:41.760 --> 18:42.760
Close enough, I think.

18:42.760 --> 18:43.760
All right.

18:43.760 --> 18:44.760
All right.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.760
So by now you're saying real Abed?

18:46.760 --> 18:48.760
Well, that wasn't fair.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.760
That was like so wild card.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.760
Well, do you want to, that's my next question.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.760
Do you want, do you want to think about it?

18:55.760 --> 19:00.760
Do you want, do you want to think, to what extent do you want to think that the character

19:00.760 --> 19:04.760
on community is like congruous with you?

19:04.760 --> 19:09.760
Like what would make you more outraged, you know, or uncomfortable?

19:09.760 --> 19:13.760
The idea that he's nothing like you or the idea that he's exactly like you and therefore

19:13.760 --> 19:15.760
I have like somehow exploited you.

19:15.760 --> 19:17.760
You know, everyone gets exploited though.

19:17.760 --> 19:18.760
That's the thing.

19:18.760 --> 19:19.760
I mean, that's nothing new.

19:19.760 --> 19:20.760
It's the American dream.

19:20.760 --> 19:24.760
Yeah, I mean, it's been happening since, and my people were exploited basically.

19:24.760 --> 19:25.760
That's fine.

19:25.760 --> 19:26.760
Yeah, by his.

19:26.760 --> 19:27.760
Right.

19:27.760 --> 19:28.760
I think we get along so well.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.760
Ryan's half Jewish and Abed's half Palestinian.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.760
That's just how it goes with friends.

19:33.760 --> 19:37.760
But no, like, I don't, I honestly.

19:37.760 --> 19:42.760
So half of you exploited half of him, but half of both of you just sit and eat Twinkies

19:42.760 --> 19:43.760
and don't care.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.760
I'm like, half of them is fine.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.760
The other half I got a problem with.

19:48.760 --> 19:49.760
Not really.

19:49.760 --> 19:54.760
I mean, so yeah, like, like, like, I wrote the part and I really wrote the part with

19:54.760 --> 20:00.760
the idea in my head that you would come in and audition for the part, which you did.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.760
Which that was an amazing time of my life, by the way.

20:02.760 --> 20:03.760
Yeah, yeah.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.760
I grew from like, you know, a boy to a close.

20:06.760 --> 20:07.760
Do you remember who else auditioned?

20:07.760 --> 20:09.760
Like who made it to the final round?

20:09.760 --> 20:10.760
It was Kumail.

20:10.760 --> 20:11.760
Kumail Nanjiani.

20:11.760 --> 20:14.760
We were both in the same room and then also, which I knew him, which was crazy because

20:14.760 --> 20:16.760
I was like, I hope you get it, buddy.

20:16.760 --> 20:17.760
And the guy from 30 Rock.

20:17.760 --> 20:20.760
Yeah, and then Danny Pooty was there too.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.760
I don't, at the time, didn't know he was Danny Pooty.

20:22.760 --> 20:23.760
Yeah.

20:23.760 --> 20:24.760
Well, he wasn't Danny Pooty.

20:24.760 --> 20:27.760
I shook his hand and he was Danny.

20:27.760 --> 20:32.760
Here's the guy from movietickets.com ad up on that point.

20:32.760 --> 20:33.760
Yeah.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.760
No, I remember something now when I was leaving.

20:35.760 --> 20:40.760
I remember leaving and I think it was when I was kind of doing good and I saw him coming

20:40.760 --> 20:41.760
out.

20:41.760 --> 20:46.760
It was Danny Pooty because I remembered his face and also you said he looked like a peanut

20:46.760 --> 20:47.760
at one point.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.760
Sorry, but you did.

20:49.760 --> 20:50.760
Yeah.

20:50.760 --> 20:53.760
And then so I was coming out and I won't take it back.

20:53.760 --> 20:54.760
I saw him on the phone.

20:54.760 --> 20:55.760
I don't know where this is going.

20:55.760 --> 20:59.760
I saw him on the phone and he looked like so happy.

20:59.760 --> 21:03.760
Like he was ecstatic and he was just like, I wasn't that happy.

21:03.760 --> 21:08.760
And so I felt like, yeah, I mean, I guess he's going to get it.

21:08.760 --> 21:09.760
I mean, everybody kind of nailed it.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.760
After you walked out, everyone was like, holy shit.

21:11.760 --> 21:17.760
That guy is like, I can see now where you got the idea for the personality, like some

21:17.760 --> 21:20.760
of the stuff on paper now makes sense, but they said the same thing after Camille.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.760
They said the same thing after, what's this?

21:22.760 --> 21:23.760
I can't really remember his name.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.760
The guy that plays the assistant in 30 Rock.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.760
Like Johnny Arben or something.

21:27.760 --> 21:28.760
Johnny Arben.

21:28.760 --> 21:29.760
That's got to be it.

21:29.760 --> 21:34.760
I feel bad now because that guy's going to get mad, right?

21:34.760 --> 21:35.760
I'm sure, yeah.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.760
He was a long time listener and tonight's the night.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.760
Finally we talked about him and we couldn't get his name.

21:39.760 --> 21:40.760
Oh, no.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.760
He's going to beat me up after the show.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.760
But, yeah, I mean, but Pooty was just the difference.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.760
Like all he came in and it was just like, okay, after he walked out, it was like, okay,

21:48.760 --> 21:51.760
so are we going to have a show with that guy in it or not?

21:51.760 --> 21:54.760
And so it had nothing to do with being right for the character.

21:54.760 --> 21:59.760
It was like, like, now let's make the character right for that guy because he's like a superstar.

21:59.760 --> 22:00.760
Well, that's how I feel.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.760
I mean, he did these amazing things when he came in.

22:02.760 --> 22:03.760
No, but see, I see that.

22:03.760 --> 22:07.760
I see that I inspired the character, but then you took it into a really cool direction and

22:07.760 --> 22:10.760
it became its own thing and so Danny brought a lot of himself to it.

22:10.760 --> 22:11.760
Yeah, yeah.

22:11.760 --> 22:12.760
And that's that's how it happened.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.760
That's what Abed, they can't fire your creator.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.760
You're going to be the same Abed the rest of your life.

22:18.760 --> 22:19.760
That's right.

22:19.760 --> 22:20.760
I'm in it for life.

22:20.760 --> 22:21.760
I mean, I can't just jump out.

22:21.760 --> 22:27.760
In a sense, half of your people are like changing it to a different time slot.

22:27.760 --> 22:28.760
We have some notes.

22:28.760 --> 22:29.760
Yeah.

22:29.760 --> 22:30.760
Yeah.

22:30.760 --> 22:33.760
You tried to fire his creator.

22:33.760 --> 22:34.760
Clearly.

22:34.760 --> 22:35.760
Yeah.

22:35.760 --> 22:36.760
Come on.

22:36.760 --> 22:37.760
All right.

22:37.760 --> 22:38.760
I don't want to go there.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.760
That's a whole other can.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.760
That's a whole other show.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.760
Do you think Palestine should be a state Abed?

22:45.760 --> 22:47.760
Well, it is Dan, actually.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.760
I mean, he calls it Israel.

22:49.760 --> 22:53.760
I call it Palestine like apples and potatoes and potatoes kind of thing.

22:53.760 --> 22:54.760
Right.

22:54.760 --> 22:55.760
Latkes and...

22:55.760 --> 22:56.760
Latkes and...

22:56.760 --> 22:57.760
Clumps of dirt.

22:57.760 --> 22:58.760
Yeah.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.760
I don't even know what they have.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.760
I don't know what they have.

23:02.760 --> 23:03.760
Do you say latkes?

23:03.760 --> 23:04.760
I say patakkes.

23:04.760 --> 23:08.760
They have some food that's like blah, blah, blah, whatever.

23:08.760 --> 23:09.760
I can't say it.

23:09.760 --> 23:10.760
I don't remember.

23:10.760 --> 23:11.760
I ate it.

23:11.760 --> 23:12.760
It was good.

23:12.760 --> 23:13.760
I don't remember what it was called.

23:13.760 --> 23:14.760
It's not called patakkes.

23:14.760 --> 23:15.760
Yeah, patakkes.

23:15.760 --> 23:19.760
If Dan had said that, he'd love it.

23:19.760 --> 23:25.760
Abed, before you go, would you tell everybody your idea for a restaurant?

23:25.760 --> 23:26.760
Oh, no.

23:26.760 --> 23:27.760
This again.

23:27.760 --> 23:28.760
How many times have we...

23:28.760 --> 23:29.760
Okay.

23:29.760 --> 23:33.760
Well, this is like, I came up with this so long ago and it was like, I don't know why.

23:33.760 --> 23:34.760
But it was a real idea for a restaurant.

23:34.760 --> 23:35.760
Yeah, it was a real idea.

23:35.760 --> 23:40.760
And for some reason, you attached to it so tenaciously over the years.

23:40.760 --> 23:41.760
Because it's insane.

23:41.760 --> 23:42.760
It's not insane, though.

23:42.760 --> 23:43.760
It's totally...

23:43.760 --> 23:45.760
It should happen, basically.

23:45.760 --> 23:46.760
Well, I'm sure they'll agree.

23:46.760 --> 23:47.760
Just tell them.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.760
Tell them.

23:48.760 --> 23:49.760
Okay.

23:49.760 --> 23:50.760
Because you forget the specifics.

23:50.760 --> 23:51.760
Like, would I tell you the story?

23:51.760 --> 23:52.760
All right.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.760
So, like, you have...

23:54.760 --> 23:58.760
Now, we all realize that little foods are taking over, right?

23:58.760 --> 23:59.760
Foods are getting smaller.

23:59.760 --> 24:00.760
I mean, that's...

24:00.760 --> 24:01.760
Yeah.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.760
Let's all agree as a premise.

24:03.760 --> 24:07.760
Let's all agree as a premise before we go any further.

24:07.760 --> 24:09.760
The little foods are taking over.

24:09.760 --> 24:12.760
Just as the Wright brothers had to accept gravity.

24:12.760 --> 24:13.760
Yeah, yeah.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.760
I mean, I didn't write the rules.

24:15.760 --> 24:16.760
There's just fundamental answers.

24:16.760 --> 24:17.760
Wake up, you guys.

24:17.760 --> 24:18.760
Okay.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.760
Fact number one, little foods are taking over.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.760
Check out the idea of large foods for now.

24:22.760 --> 24:23.760
For one time in your life.

24:23.760 --> 24:24.760
I mean, okay.

24:24.760 --> 24:25.760
You're in a restaurant.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.760
You see a plate of little burgers and a plate of a normal burger.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.760
I think you'll go to the little burgers.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.760
Fact number two, right?

24:33.760 --> 24:36.760
You could have, like, one little burger and be like,

24:36.760 --> 24:38.760
oh, man, I got a taste and I don't feel guilty.

24:38.760 --> 24:39.760
It's great.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.760
The whole hamburger, if you eat, like, some of it

24:41.760 --> 24:42.760
and you just put it down, you're like,

24:42.760 --> 24:43.760
that guy's wasting food.

24:43.760 --> 24:44.760
Fuck him, you know?

24:44.760 --> 24:46.760
It's like, you look and you can't save it for later

24:46.760 --> 24:47.760
because it's weird.

24:47.760 --> 24:48.760
I don't know.

24:48.760 --> 24:49.760
So, anyway...

24:49.760 --> 24:50.760
I was here, baby.

24:50.760 --> 24:54.760
I'm like, where can you go to get food that's all small?

24:54.760 --> 24:55.760
You know?

24:55.760 --> 24:58.760
There's no place.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.760
You could go to the Smurfs Village.

25:01.760 --> 25:02.760
That doesn't exist, though.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.760
A tapas restaurant?

25:04.760 --> 25:05.760
I think we've looked for that.

25:05.760 --> 25:06.760
What?

25:06.760 --> 25:07.760
Tapas.

25:07.760 --> 25:08.760
A tapas restaurant?

25:08.760 --> 25:10.760
Spanish have been doing this for centuries.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.760
Oh, so they make small, like, burritos and tacos and stuff?

25:13.760 --> 25:14.760
They make little...

25:14.760 --> 25:15.760
No, no, no.

25:15.760 --> 25:16.760
I mean, like...

25:16.760 --> 25:17.760
No, no.

25:17.760 --> 25:18.760
That's Mexico.

25:18.760 --> 25:19.760
Describe your...

25:19.760 --> 25:22.760
The Spanish don't make burritos.

25:22.760 --> 25:24.760
Describe your restaurant, Abba.

25:24.760 --> 25:25.760
Describe your restaurant.

25:25.760 --> 25:26.760
Oh, yeah, right.

25:26.760 --> 25:27.760
So the restaurant's called Bytes.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.760
Bytes.

25:28.760 --> 25:31.760
And at the time, I thought it was clever to spell it with a Y.

25:31.760 --> 25:32.760
Right.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.760
Because then everyone would think it was a computer store.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.760
Yeah, the computer age was starting to, like, jump into the...

25:36.760 --> 25:37.760
when I came up with the idea.

25:37.760 --> 25:38.760
Yeah.

25:38.760 --> 25:40.760
And then I was like, this idea...

25:40.760 --> 25:41.760
Okay, okay.

25:41.760 --> 25:42.760
You just go in...

25:42.760 --> 25:45.760
Okay, let's say I'm with someone, like, a girlfriend.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.760
If I had a girlfriend and she's like, oh, my God, I don't want pizza again.

25:48.760 --> 25:49.760
You asshole.

25:49.760 --> 25:50.760
I want burgers.

25:50.760 --> 25:51.760
And you're like, fuck you.

25:51.760 --> 25:52.760
I want burgers.

25:52.760 --> 25:53.760
You know, that happens all the time.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.760
And Bytes, she can have her...

25:56.760 --> 25:59.760
What kind of relationship is this?

25:59.760 --> 26:01.760
I was generalizing.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.760
It sounds like a terrible relationship.

26:03.760 --> 26:04.760
I'm saying...

26:04.760 --> 26:08.760
You're like thinking, fuck you, but you're saying, like, oh, I would like something else.

26:08.760 --> 26:09.760
Okay.

26:09.760 --> 26:10.760
All right.

26:10.760 --> 26:11.760
That's your thinking.

26:11.760 --> 26:12.760
It's that Louis Armstrong song, right?

26:12.760 --> 26:13.760
Talk to her nicely.

26:13.760 --> 26:14.760
Okay.

26:14.760 --> 26:15.760
Treat her like a lady.

26:15.760 --> 26:16.760
Okay.

26:16.760 --> 26:17.760
Well, fuck you, lady.

26:17.760 --> 26:18.760
Okay.

26:18.760 --> 26:19.760
Fuck you, lady.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.760
But, no, I mean, I, you know, okay.

26:21.760 --> 26:23.760
So that's the thing is like...

26:23.760 --> 26:24.760
So you walk into Bytes.

26:24.760 --> 26:25.760
Yeah.

26:25.760 --> 26:26.760
And the...

26:26.760 --> 26:27.760
And the maitre d is that he sits you?

26:27.760 --> 26:29.760
Well, he's small too, actually.

26:29.760 --> 26:33.760
The whole thing is going to be like, yeah, I have it all for you.

26:33.760 --> 26:34.760
Wait.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.760
I mean, okay.

26:35.760 --> 26:36.760
Okay.

26:36.760 --> 26:37.760
You guys are all laughing, but...

26:37.760 --> 26:39.760
You're just talking about a tiny little village.

26:39.760 --> 26:44.760
You guys are laughing, but if he's a little person and you order...

26:44.760 --> 26:45.760
It's like...

26:45.760 --> 26:49.760
He intensifies the experience because you're like, everything's small, so no.

26:49.760 --> 26:50.760
No, no, no.

26:50.760 --> 26:51.760
They're giants.

26:51.760 --> 26:52.760
They should be giant.

26:52.760 --> 26:56.760
They should cast high relief on how small the bite of your food is.

26:56.760 --> 26:59.760
If your waiter's tiny, he gives you a tiny piece of pizza.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.760
It looks like a real pizza.

27:01.760 --> 27:06.760
But that's what's cool because in his world it's like, oh, normal pizza, but then he

27:06.760 --> 27:09.760
gives it to you and you're like, whoa, small pizza from a small guy.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.760
Is he like a character when you come in?

27:11.760 --> 27:15.760
He says, hey, can I get you some normal sized food?

27:15.760 --> 27:19.760
And there's a sign that says, don't tell him.

27:19.760 --> 27:24.760
You should be a co-partner.

27:24.760 --> 27:28.760
I've invested in worse, I believe.

27:28.760 --> 27:30.760
I couldn't have thought of that.

27:30.760 --> 27:32.760
Abed, what is on the menu at Bites?

27:32.760 --> 27:34.760
Take you through that.

27:34.760 --> 27:36.760
What are the appetizers?

27:36.760 --> 27:37.760
The map of the world.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.760
The whole thing is appetizers, right?

27:39.760 --> 27:41.760
Yeah, there's every kind of food there.

27:41.760 --> 27:45.760
So you come in and you're like, man, I just love kebabs.

27:45.760 --> 27:46.760
Oh, they're so good.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.760
And McDonald's are like, kebab, what?

27:49.760 --> 27:50.760
What the fuck?

27:50.760 --> 27:51.760
Get out.

27:51.760 --> 27:54.760
But you go to Bites and you just go to the section of the map where the Middle East

27:54.760 --> 27:56.760
is and you got your kebabs right there, baby.

27:56.760 --> 27:59.760
What does a kebab at Bites look like?

27:59.760 --> 28:06.760
It's like a tiny, like, Euro or kebab or whatever.

28:06.760 --> 28:07.760
It's just miniaturized.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.760
Yeah, it's supposed to be a little poop or something.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.760
Kebabs look like poop.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.760
Am I the only one that knows that?

28:14.760 --> 28:16.760
Yes, they do.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.760
Not if you're doing it right.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.760
I see a kebab and I go giant turd.

28:20.760 --> 28:21.760
It's not a food.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.760
Okay, you want to say little turd.

28:23.760 --> 28:25.760
Well, yeah, a little turd in here.

28:25.760 --> 28:28.760
I walk into Bites with my girlfriend, whom I love.

28:28.760 --> 28:29.760
Okay.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.760
And I walk in there and I say, you know, honey, what are you in the mood for?

28:32.760 --> 28:34.760
She goes, I'm in the mood for soup.

28:34.760 --> 28:35.760
Wow.

28:35.760 --> 28:39.760
I would like a Vietnamese pho.

28:39.760 --> 28:43.760
That's so fascinating because he had the same thing back in the day,

28:43.760 --> 28:46.760
but his question was like, what about if I want soda?

28:46.760 --> 28:48.760
Do I get a little drop of soda?

28:48.760 --> 28:50.760
What's the deal with that?

28:50.760 --> 28:53.760
And then I had to say, which I think I was like mentally like,

28:53.760 --> 28:54.760
fuck, what do I say?

28:54.760 --> 28:55.760
He's got me.

28:55.760 --> 28:58.760
I was like, all right, normal sized soda because let's face it,

28:58.760 --> 29:02.760
no one's going to be like excited about a drop of soda.

29:02.760 --> 29:06.760
So I think with the soup, I'm not excited about midget waiters.

29:06.760 --> 29:10.760
Well, yeah, that's going to freak me out too.

29:10.760 --> 29:15.760
Okay. Well, then you guys are there was a guy at the,

29:15.760 --> 29:18.760
I mean, we're just trying to talk you to your business model here.

29:18.760 --> 29:20.760
Can I tell you real quick?

29:20.760 --> 29:21.760
I'm not a businessman.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.760
I just want to interject when I was like 10 years old for a time,

29:24.760 --> 29:26.760
my parents separated and I lived with my mom in South Milwaukee,

29:26.760 --> 29:28.760
as we called it, South Milwaukee.

29:28.760 --> 29:32.760
And there was a McDonald's there that my grandma always recommended

29:32.760 --> 29:34.760
because it had Billy the brownie.

29:34.760 --> 29:38.760
And I always, I grew up thinking Billy the brownie was a legitimate McDonald's

29:38.760 --> 29:40.760
land character.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.760
A little did I know I was going to a South Milwaukee McDonald's

29:43.760 --> 29:47.760
where some like homeless little person dressed up like an elf

29:47.760 --> 29:51.760
and just hung out at McDonald's and would just talk to children

29:51.760 --> 29:52.760
and old people.

29:52.760 --> 29:53.760
That was his name, Billy Brownie?

29:53.760 --> 29:54.760
Yeah, Billy the brownie.

29:54.760 --> 29:56.760
Like a walk on character?

29:56.760 --> 29:57.760
And this was the, this was the,

29:57.760 --> 29:59.760
It's like from Willow, remember the brownie?

29:59.760 --> 30:00.760
Yeah, yeah.

30:00.760 --> 30:03.760
This was the early 80s and I had seen that Donald Sutherland movie

30:03.760 --> 30:04.760
Don't Look Now.

30:04.760 --> 30:10.760
Like, yeah, and a deafening silence from our 25 year old peanut gallery.

30:10.760 --> 30:14.760
Let me tell you, that'll put the midget fear in you in that movie.

30:14.760 --> 30:18.760
I mean, I can't control your, you know, whatever your psychoses is.

30:18.760 --> 30:20.760
I mean, well, well, well, well, we're not,

30:20.760 --> 30:24.760
no, I'm just saying like, that's the one experience I have

30:24.760 --> 30:26.760
with being in a restaurant and having a little person be.

30:26.760 --> 30:29.760
I thought you were attacking the restaurant with that psychoses story.

30:29.760 --> 30:32.760
I get, well, I think Jeff and I were both suggesting to you that

30:32.760 --> 30:37.760
with all due respect to all humanity, like the idea of institutionalized

30:37.760 --> 30:40.760
like genetic, it's a eugenic kind of thing you're doing.

30:40.760 --> 30:44.760
Like you're going like, it's like a doxin that you've bred to work at your restaurant.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.760
You're opening a lot of doors for me here,

30:46.760 --> 30:48.760
because now I'm thinking of Oopa Loopa situation.

30:48.760 --> 30:52.760
I can get, you can find a special kind of little person that exists.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.760
It's like hooters for little people.

30:54.760 --> 30:57.760
They only exist in one land and their skin is like blue and they're like,

30:57.760 --> 30:58.760
or not blue.

30:58.760 --> 30:59.760
What about the animals?

30:59.760 --> 31:01.760
Are you going to breed little animals?

31:01.760 --> 31:05.760
I feel like community would have a better show with this obed.

31:05.760 --> 31:06.760
I do, yeah.

31:06.760 --> 31:08.760
We've been a way different show, yeah.

31:08.760 --> 31:09.760
I want to drove them nothing.

31:09.760 --> 31:13.760
Okay, so now I don't want to bend your mind,

31:13.760 --> 31:15.760
but take me into the kitchen at Bites,

31:15.760 --> 31:19.760
because this is where my investment is hesitant,

31:19.760 --> 31:23.760
because I feel like the overhead is maximized in a kitchen where,

31:23.760 --> 31:28.760
okay, so three tiny pizzas, one half anchovies, one half mushroom,

31:28.760 --> 31:33.760
and two tiny, tiny tacos, and one tiny chicken shish kebab.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.760
They have to...

31:35.760 --> 31:37.760
You make a real pizza in the kitchen.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.760
Here's my pitch.

31:38.760 --> 31:39.760
You make a real pizza in the kitchen,

31:39.760 --> 31:42.760
and then you have a little cookie cutter,

31:42.760 --> 31:45.760
the shape like teeth, like a little bite.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.760
It looks like somebody already bit out of the pizza.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.760
That is awesome.

31:49.760 --> 31:50.760
Wow.

31:50.760 --> 31:53.760
I'm like, you guys are opening so many new doors here.

31:53.760 --> 31:59.760
So you have a bite of a burger that the teeth have already incised the burger,

31:59.760 --> 32:01.760
and you have that on the side.

32:01.760 --> 32:06.760
And then you put crumbs on the little person's cheek that meets you,

32:06.760 --> 32:09.760
and let me finish.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.760
And he's the spokesmodel for the restaurant,

32:12.760 --> 32:17.760
and his catchphrase is, I'm full.

32:17.760 --> 32:21.760
You can finish it.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.760
Over five locations.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.760
Now on Hollywood and Layton.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.760
You can finish it.

32:27.760 --> 32:29.760
There's our commercial, man.

32:29.760 --> 32:33.760
Because his stomach is extra small.

32:33.760 --> 32:36.760
Well, that's cool because it's like the Chuck E. Cheese thing.

32:36.760 --> 32:40.760
Everyone looks like the one thing, the one guy, you know?

32:40.760 --> 32:42.760
It's like if I had a ton of Chuck E. Cheese, it's Chuck E. Cheese.

32:42.760 --> 32:43.760
Yeah, yeah.

32:43.760 --> 32:44.760
It's like that.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.760
They all kind of look the same, oop-a-loop-as things,

32:46.760 --> 32:49.760
and yeah, and they take bites out of the food,

32:49.760 --> 32:52.760
but they don't actually do that.

32:52.760 --> 32:54.760
All right, one more thing,

32:54.760 --> 32:56.760
and then we're going to keep the train moving.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.760
I wanted to give you that kitchen update.

32:58.760 --> 33:01.760
Well, I just think, honestly, it's a non-solvent business.

33:01.760 --> 33:03.760
And I don't think you thought it through,

33:03.760 --> 33:07.760
because I think the reason why Mexican restaurants don't bother to go,

33:07.760 --> 33:10.760
oh, fuck it, you can also get a fish sandwich here and plus a pizza,

33:10.760 --> 33:14.760
is because they would have to then, it wouldn't be worth it for them.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.760
You have to kind of focus your menu.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.760
Well, it's a little cheesecake factory, basically.

33:18.760 --> 33:19.760
Right.

33:19.760 --> 33:22.760
Well, you know, I mean, there's 50 things in that menu, right?

33:22.760 --> 33:23.760
I'm going to compromise though,

33:23.760 --> 33:26.760
because what if now we make a special food land?

33:26.760 --> 33:28.760
So you enter food land,

33:28.760 --> 33:30.760
and there's like every restaurant in food land,

33:30.760 --> 33:32.760
kind of like the Disney of restaurants,

33:32.760 --> 33:34.760
because my dream was like,

33:34.760 --> 33:37.760
I wanted people to have whatever they wanted in one place.

33:37.760 --> 33:38.760
Oh, right, right.

33:38.760 --> 33:39.760
That was the dream.

33:39.760 --> 33:42.760
And that's what Goldberg says, it's called the food court.

33:42.760 --> 33:44.760
But food courts suck,

33:44.760 --> 33:46.760
and they don't have any good food.

33:46.760 --> 33:47.760
And it's too big.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.760
Yeah, I'm like, what the fuck do I get?

33:49.760 --> 33:52.760
I'm going to eat a whole bowl of noodles.

33:52.760 --> 33:53.760
Imagine entering.

33:53.760 --> 33:54.760
What am I, a monster?

33:54.760 --> 33:56.760
Imagine a glorious theme park,

33:56.760 --> 33:58.760
where it's like, you know what I mean?

33:58.760 --> 33:59.760
It's like you're visiting France.

33:59.760 --> 34:00.760
Yeah.

34:00.760 --> 34:01.760
But you're actually eating French, you know what I mean?

34:01.760 --> 34:04.760
So you're talking about Epcot Center.

34:04.760 --> 34:07.760
You're talking about a miniaturized Lego land Epcot Center.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.760
Yeah, wow.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.760
Yeah, I guess I haven't been there, so,

34:11.760 --> 34:13.760
that's probably what it's like.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.760
All right, you look a good real abbot.

34:15.760 --> 34:17.760
Let's have a hand for real abbot.

34:17.760 --> 34:18.760
Thank you.

34:18.760 --> 34:19.760
Thanks everybody.

34:19.760 --> 34:20.760
Thank you.

34:20.760 --> 34:21.760
You can...

34:21.760 --> 34:22.760
Come on.

34:22.760 --> 34:23.760
Come on.

34:23.760 --> 34:24.760
Come on.

34:27.760 --> 34:28.760
Me too.

34:28.760 --> 34:29.760
It's nice, I think...

34:29.760 --> 34:32.760
Yeah, I guess why don't you take a hike too, Ridley?

34:32.760 --> 34:34.760
Thank you for coming, Ryan Ridley.

34:34.760 --> 34:37.760
That's how you get Ryan Ridley to come to your show.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.760
You give him some stage time.

34:41.760 --> 34:44.760
It's nice, I think everyone should create TV shows

34:44.760 --> 34:46.760
with their friends in them, because then,

34:46.760 --> 34:50.760
who is normally just normal abbot, becomes real abbot.

34:50.760 --> 34:52.760
And he was kind of an unreal guy before,

34:52.760 --> 34:55.760
and now whenever I see him, I go, hey, it's real abbot, man.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.760
It's groovy.

34:56.760 --> 34:57.760
I'm more real to you.

34:57.760 --> 34:58.760
Yeah, exactly.

34:58.760 --> 34:59.760
It's nice.

34:59.760 --> 35:00.760
It's a nice...

35:00.760 --> 35:03.760
You're welcome, abbot, for the favor I did you, but...

35:03.760 --> 35:06.760
Is there any part of you, Dan, that feels like...

35:06.760 --> 35:10.760
What's your feeling about creating a character based on him?

35:10.760 --> 35:13.760
Which version of that is your favorite?

35:13.760 --> 35:14.760
Well, I mean, I said...

35:14.760 --> 35:15.760
What do you mean?

35:15.760 --> 35:16.760
Oh, do you like...

35:16.760 --> 35:18.760
Which abbot do I like more?

35:18.760 --> 35:19.760
Yeah.

35:19.760 --> 35:22.760
Do you like your creation, or do you like the inspiration?

35:22.760 --> 35:24.760
No, come on, of course I like real abbot, he's real.

35:24.760 --> 35:25.760
Oh, good.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.760
Yeah.

35:26.760 --> 35:27.760
Me too.

35:29.760 --> 35:30.760
I have everything...

35:30.760 --> 35:32.760
We were at a party one time at Rob Schrab's place,

35:32.760 --> 35:33.760
and...

35:33.760 --> 35:34.760
And...

35:34.760 --> 35:37.760
Abbot was talking to a person that had passed out.

35:37.760 --> 35:38.760
Oh, god damn it.

35:38.760 --> 35:39.760
Rob...

35:39.760 --> 35:41.760
There was a person that had completely fallen asleep,

35:41.760 --> 35:44.760
and was like, head back...

35:44.760 --> 35:47.760
And abbot, you were breaking it down.

35:47.760 --> 35:48.760
And...

35:48.760 --> 35:50.760
I didn't know he fell asleep.

35:50.760 --> 35:51.760
Exactly.

35:51.760 --> 35:52.760
Abbot just called out...

35:52.760 --> 35:54.760
I didn't know he fell asleep, exactly.

35:54.760 --> 35:57.760
He was cutting the silhouette of a person sleeping.

35:57.760 --> 35:58.760
He only...

35:58.760 --> 36:02.760
He only lacked the disease coming out of his head.

36:02.760 --> 36:05.760
The entire party started, so at a certain point we went like,

36:05.760 --> 36:08.760
look what's happening over there.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.760
And abbot was just talking...

36:10.760 --> 36:12.760
There was music playing, and he was talking to our friend,

36:12.760 --> 36:14.760
Rod, who was full on asleep.

36:14.760 --> 36:16.760
And for real, like, not only...

36:16.760 --> 36:18.760
This won't translate to the podcast,

36:18.760 --> 36:20.760
but, like, seriously, not only talking to him,

36:20.760 --> 36:22.760
like, so I guess you could see, like, you're talking,

36:22.760 --> 36:23.760
you're lost in thought, so you just,

36:23.760 --> 36:24.760
you don't notice a person listening.

36:24.760 --> 36:27.760
But, like, abbot was making these expressions.

36:27.760 --> 36:28.760
He was going like...

36:30.760 --> 36:32.760
Like, he was somehow getting feedback

36:32.760 --> 36:34.760
from our unconscious friend.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.760
As Rod slowly slumped...

36:37.760 --> 36:40.760
Like, before he hit the floor, like...

36:40.760 --> 36:42.760
Like, his head was like...

36:42.760 --> 36:44.760
He looked like he was dead.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.760
His head was dangling, and abbot was just talking to him,

36:47.760 --> 36:49.760
like, he was on the view or something.

36:49.760 --> 36:50.760
But the reason...

36:50.760 --> 36:52.760
He was talking about work, I worked with him.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.760
And in boredom, they were talking about work.

36:54.760 --> 36:56.760
The beauty of that thing...

36:56.760 --> 36:58.760
What was great about that moment is not that

36:58.760 --> 37:00.760
that was funny and hilarious, I mean, it was,

37:00.760 --> 37:03.760
but, like, I like the sound of my own voice, too.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.760
I would love the freedom just to talk to a corpse for a while.

37:06.760 --> 37:09.760
Or to, yeah, to not care that much?

37:09.760 --> 37:11.760
Like, I repeat my story,

37:11.760 --> 37:13.760
so we tell the same stories in Harmontown

37:13.760 --> 37:14.760
a million times over.

37:14.760 --> 37:17.760
It'd be great just if you guys were all just mannequins.

37:17.760 --> 37:18.760
We could just...

37:18.760 --> 37:20.760
We could tell the big Jell-O story again.

37:20.760 --> 37:21.760
It'd be great.

37:21.760 --> 37:22.760
It's like a superpower.

37:22.760 --> 37:25.760
Let's keep the people that auditioned

37:25.760 --> 37:27.760
for the part of Abaddon community train rolling

37:27.760 --> 37:29.760
and bring up Kumail Nanjiani.

37:29.760 --> 37:32.760
Yeah.

37:33.760 --> 37:35.760
It's a theme tonight.

37:37.760 --> 37:39.760
I didn't know you auditioned for that.

37:39.760 --> 37:40.760
Huh?

37:40.760 --> 37:41.760
I didn't know you auditioned for that.

37:41.760 --> 37:42.760
Yeah.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.760
I auditioned to be that guy.

37:44.760 --> 37:45.760
How'd it go?

37:45.760 --> 37:48.760
Well, I didn't get it, but I got pretty close.

37:48.760 --> 37:50.760
Oh, yeah, for sure, man.

37:50.760 --> 37:52.760
I would stay up at night going, fuck, did I?

37:52.760 --> 37:54.760
I mean, if it weren't for Danny Pudi

37:54.760 --> 37:56.760
and for real Abaddon sitting in the audience right now,

37:56.760 --> 37:58.760
I would tell you, like, man, second place.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.760
I'd never...

38:00.760 --> 38:02.760
Thank you.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.760
I had never acted at that point, by the way.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.760
That was my first...

38:08.760 --> 38:10.760
When I auditioned for that, I had no fucking idea what it was doing.

38:10.760 --> 38:12.760
And you were really nice.

38:12.760 --> 38:14.760
I'd met you before a little bit and you came out to all of us

38:14.760 --> 38:17.760
and you were like, you know, it's a really awkward, weird fucking process.

38:17.760 --> 38:18.760
Sorry, we have to go through it.

38:18.760 --> 38:21.760
You, like, apologized for the process, which nobody does.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.760
Yeah.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.760
That was very hard to work with.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.760
Well, you gave me the wrong impression that day

38:26.760 --> 38:29.760
because I was like, oh, he's such an easy-going, nice guy.

38:29.760 --> 38:30.760
It's weird, it's weird.

38:30.760 --> 38:31.760
Yeah.

38:31.760 --> 38:32.760
I can't...

38:32.760 --> 38:35.760
I can't decide if Abad is Adam Goldberg Light

38:35.760 --> 38:37.760
or if Adam Goldberg is Abad Light.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.760
I don't know, I don't know.

38:39.760 --> 38:42.760
Like, there's a whole Rubik's Cube of humanity

38:42.760 --> 38:44.760
in our McDonald's land.

38:44.760 --> 38:45.760
It's crazy.

38:45.760 --> 38:47.760
I'm gonna open your...

38:47.760 --> 38:49.760
Adam Goldberg's been playing hard to get.

38:49.760 --> 38:50.760
Like, that's his new strategy.

38:50.760 --> 38:51.760
No, he's not.

38:51.760 --> 38:54.760
He retired from being a character at the Egyptian show

38:54.760 --> 38:56.760
and, like, he's playing it cool.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.760
He's reversed psychology.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.760
He's the gaming us.

39:00.760 --> 39:01.760
Oh, yeah.

39:01.760 --> 39:04.760
Next time he wears, like, a huge hat to peacock.

39:04.760 --> 39:05.760
Like, oh.

39:05.760 --> 39:06.760
Ignore me.

39:06.760 --> 39:08.760
I have noticed from Adam's behavior

39:08.760 --> 39:12.760
that he's obviously read weird, like, men's guides dedicating

39:12.760 --> 39:15.760
because he does things like he'll give you a gift,

39:15.760 --> 39:17.760
but then two weeks later, he'll go,

39:17.760 --> 39:18.760
can I have that back?

39:18.760 --> 39:22.760
And it's like, come on, that had to come from some creepy, like,

39:22.760 --> 39:25.760
FHM guy, like, like, guide to Gettner.

39:25.760 --> 39:28.760
FHM.com slash approximate human behavior.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.760
Like...

39:30.760 --> 39:31.760
Yeah.

39:31.760 --> 39:33.760
So, uh...

39:33.760 --> 39:35.760
Uh...

39:35.760 --> 39:38.760
But now, yeah, and he's just, he's cold-shouldering us.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.760
I mean, now, he's sitting, he's in the front,

39:40.760 --> 39:41.760
he's in the second row.

39:41.760 --> 39:43.760
He's the second row now, yeah.

39:43.760 --> 39:44.760
I shouldn't say cold-shouldering us,

39:44.760 --> 39:45.760
because he's not armed.

39:45.760 --> 39:46.760
He's still piping up.

39:46.760 --> 39:47.760
But no, look at him.

39:47.760 --> 39:48.760
He's got a healthy glow.

39:48.760 --> 39:49.760
He's smiling.

39:49.760 --> 39:50.760
He's having a good time.

39:50.760 --> 39:52.760
He's making us jealous.

39:52.760 --> 39:55.760
Like, he's showing up at the ex-girlfriend's party

39:55.760 --> 39:57.760
and being like, hey, what's up?

39:57.760 --> 39:58.760
He just lifted up his sweater

39:58.760 --> 40:00.760
and showed us a Harmontown shirt underneath it.

40:00.760 --> 40:03.760
Like, there's something terrible is about to happen.

40:03.760 --> 40:04.760
You should listen to...

40:04.760 --> 40:08.760
And underneath that shirt is clearly a bomb.

40:08.760 --> 40:12.760
When you listen to his interview on the podcast cast,

40:12.760 --> 40:15.760
he gets deeply...

40:15.760 --> 40:19.760
Aaron said she heard it and she was crying

40:19.760 --> 40:21.760
because it gets so personally revelatory.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.760
I listened to it and I was like, well, that's no.

40:23.760 --> 40:25.760
It's like, Adam's like, you know,

40:25.760 --> 40:27.760
he's got a lot of my DNA.

40:27.760 --> 40:30.760
Maybe 50%.

40:30.760 --> 40:32.760
I'll bet or Adam.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.760
Adam, right.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.760
But he was like, you know,

40:36.760 --> 40:38.760
he's got one foot in, one foot out.

40:38.760 --> 40:39.760
Like, when's he being self-deprecating?

40:39.760 --> 40:40.760
Is he a narcissist?

40:40.760 --> 40:41.760
Does he hate himself?

40:41.760 --> 40:42.760
Blah, blah, blah.

40:42.760 --> 40:45.760
He's telling the story of how Adam's a dungeon master.

40:45.760 --> 40:48.760
Like, Adam's origin story,

40:48.760 --> 40:50.760
when you peel back the comic book characters,

40:50.760 --> 40:53.760
lares the night that Spencer came,

40:53.760 --> 40:54.760
that fateful night,

40:54.760 --> 40:56.760
and Spencer raised his hand when we said,

40:56.760 --> 40:57.760
is there a dungeon master here?

40:57.760 --> 40:59.760
Adam's a dungeon master.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.760
And Adam wasn't here that night.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.760
There's always a Spencer.

41:03.760 --> 41:04.760
For real?

41:04.760 --> 41:07.760
And he has had to live with the agony

41:07.760 --> 41:09.760
of some hypothetical alternate timeline,

41:09.760 --> 41:12.760
where he is Spencer ever since.

41:12.760 --> 41:15.760
The Spencer of the Opera.

41:15.760 --> 41:20.760
Which includes him coming on tour with us.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.760
The poster has his face on it.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.760
Adam, you're a dungeon master?

41:24.760 --> 41:26.760
Well, I have a story about it,

41:26.760 --> 41:28.760
but I'm playing hard to get, so I don't know.

41:28.760 --> 41:30.760
That's not how you do it.

41:30.760 --> 41:32.760
You can't say...

41:32.760 --> 41:35.760
You can't reveal your strategy.

41:35.760 --> 41:36.760
That kills it.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.760
That should be rule number one.

41:38.760 --> 41:40.760
Don't tell anyone you read this article.

41:40.760 --> 41:42.760
Step two.

41:42.760 --> 41:45.760
Because Camille, you played hard to get for a year and a half.

41:45.760 --> 41:47.760
We had to ask you to come up on stage.

41:47.760 --> 41:48.760
No, I didn't play hard to get.

41:48.760 --> 41:52.760
I came because my wife started off producing the show.

41:52.760 --> 41:53.760
Her idea.

41:53.760 --> 41:54.760
Yeah, it was her idea.

41:54.760 --> 41:56.760
Dan Harmon used to do a podcast.

41:56.760 --> 42:00.760
Yeah, it's not the light bulb.

42:00.760 --> 42:02.760
I mean, everyone had a podcast already.

42:02.760 --> 42:03.760
I was the last person to not have one.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.760
She was like, come on, I feel bad for you.

42:05.760 --> 42:06.760
She did?

42:06.760 --> 42:09.760
Yeah, where is this going?

42:09.760 --> 42:11.760
So I used to come and watch with her.

42:11.760 --> 42:13.760
Because, you know, I really liked watching the show.

42:13.760 --> 42:15.760
So I would come and hang out and watch the show for like a year.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.760
But you had never played D&D before.

42:17.760 --> 42:18.760
No.

42:18.760 --> 42:19.760
But you're a gamer.

42:19.760 --> 42:20.760
You love games, right?

42:20.760 --> 42:21.760
Yeah, you know, I grew up in Pakistan.

42:21.760 --> 42:22.760
We didn't really have...

42:22.760 --> 42:24.760
D&D wasn't really a thing.

42:24.760 --> 42:25.760
Nobody I knew ever did.

42:25.760 --> 42:31.760
Too close to home.

42:31.760 --> 42:32.760
Because of an institution...

42:32.760 --> 42:35.760
What do you think Pakistan is like?

42:35.760 --> 42:36.760
Dragons?

42:36.760 --> 42:37.760
Well, Dan Harmon...

42:37.760 --> 42:40.760
I mean, you don't have first world problems, right?

42:40.760 --> 42:47.760
By definition, we don't.

42:47.760 --> 42:48.760
I thought...

42:48.760 --> 42:52.760
Hey, listen, all I know is what I read in my Noam Chomsky books.

42:52.760 --> 42:58.760
I thought we had institutionalized the system of enforced, you know, like, like, like, you know,

42:58.760 --> 43:02.760
medieval, like, like, theocracy over there.

43:02.760 --> 43:07.760
Like, playing one against the other and kind of keeping everyone, everyone east of a certain

43:07.760 --> 43:09.760
line in a place where...

43:09.760 --> 43:14.760
I guess Pakistan is closer to D&D land than Minnesota.

43:14.760 --> 43:15.760
Yes, yes.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.760
Let's end this spectrum.

43:17.760 --> 43:18.760
Yeah, more caves.

43:18.760 --> 43:19.760
Yeah, we have...

43:19.760 --> 43:20.760
I'm not saying there's ogres there.

43:20.760 --> 43:21.760
You're on the line.

43:21.760 --> 43:25.760
Caves is right on the line.

43:25.760 --> 43:30.760
I feel like I really want to argue with you guys, but I can't really find an argument right

43:30.760 --> 43:31.760
now.

43:31.760 --> 43:32.760
Well, it's an interesting...

43:32.760 --> 43:33.760
It is.

43:33.760 --> 43:39.260
What is my obligation as a first world or a privileged guy growing up in Wisconsin?

43:39.260 --> 43:48.760
Am I a better person if I acknowledge that the Middle East is a kind of artificially enforced

43:48.760 --> 43:50.760
kind of medieval territory?

43:50.760 --> 43:54.760
Or am I a better person if I go, there are people too.

43:54.760 --> 43:55.760
That's a great...

43:55.760 --> 43:56.760
Oh, that's a...

43:56.760 --> 43:59.560
For the Fertile Crescent, what a wonderful place, the Paris of the planet.

43:59.560 --> 44:02.760
I think there's a happy medium between those two.

44:02.760 --> 44:08.760
The happy medium being that it's not medieval, and also it's not the Paris of the planet.

44:08.760 --> 44:15.120
I think the happy medium would be that you and I grew up in a culture where we have so

44:15.120 --> 44:20.680
much free time that we can pretend to live in a world where every corner you walk around

44:20.680 --> 44:22.760
like a guy might chop you up with an axe.

44:22.760 --> 44:23.760
Exactly.

44:23.760 --> 44:24.760
Again...

44:24.760 --> 44:25.760
That's our fantasy.

44:25.760 --> 44:30.400
I don't know how accurate that is per se.

44:30.400 --> 44:36.320
I mean, I do have axe wounds all over me, but if you're good at dodging, you can live to

44:36.320 --> 44:42.600
be, you know, the average age is 19, but that's including the infant mortality.

44:42.600 --> 44:44.120
We all saw Argo.

44:44.120 --> 44:45.600
We all know everything.

44:45.600 --> 44:50.720
Dan, do you think Pakistan is more magical than Wisconsin?

44:50.720 --> 44:52.840
I just...

44:52.840 --> 44:55.320
It's more of all the territories over there.

44:55.320 --> 44:56.320
It's like one of the...

44:56.320 --> 44:57.320
Territories?

44:57.320 --> 44:58.320
You mean countries?

44:58.320 --> 44:59.320
Of all the territories?

44:59.320 --> 45:00.320
All the...

45:00.320 --> 45:01.320
Your tribes?

45:01.320 --> 45:02.320
Of all the...

45:02.320 --> 45:03.320
You mean my family?

45:03.320 --> 45:13.360
Out of all the military bases that we have over there, it is one of the more westernized

45:13.360 --> 45:16.560
that has had a tradition of collaboration with...

45:16.560 --> 45:17.560
Yeah.

45:17.560 --> 45:18.560
It's sort of...

45:18.560 --> 45:19.560
I would...

45:19.560 --> 45:20.560
The Great Great Satan.

45:20.560 --> 45:21.560
Terminate it.

45:21.560 --> 45:22.560
Frenemy of America.

45:22.560 --> 45:23.560
Yeah.

45:23.560 --> 45:24.560
Frenemy, yeah.

45:24.560 --> 45:25.560
Yeah.

45:25.560 --> 45:26.560
Frenemies.

45:26.560 --> 45:31.800
It really is because a lot of the country, obviously, against the West, because it sort

45:31.800 --> 45:37.160
of stands for everything, the opposite of what sort of Islam stands for in a lot of ways,

45:37.160 --> 45:41.860
but then also there's a big seduction of the West, so once we got MTV, like boys started

45:41.860 --> 45:45.000
wearing shorts, so it's sort of a weird tussle.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.440
It really is.

45:46.440 --> 45:48.800
You saw the country change once MTV happened.

45:48.800 --> 45:49.800
I saw it.

45:49.800 --> 45:50.800
Yeah.

45:50.800 --> 45:54.440
It was all over MTV.

45:54.440 --> 45:58.280
Kurt Loder, you had the Pakistan transformation hour.

45:58.280 --> 46:05.600
No, the...when 9-Eleven happened, there was...I really honestly can't recall the details,

46:05.600 --> 46:07.800
but I remember Pakistan was sort of front and center in the headlines.

46:07.800 --> 46:08.920
I think it had something to do with...

46:08.920 --> 46:09.920
I could see that.

46:09.920 --> 46:18.200
We needed...there's always some country like Libya, or something happens and America wants

46:18.200 --> 46:24.080
to maneuver something, and then there's some character that no one's thought about for

46:24.080 --> 46:25.080
10 years.

46:25.080 --> 46:26.080
No one's used the word.

46:26.080 --> 46:29.280
I remember when 9-Eleven happened, it was like, Pakistan, Pakistan, Pakistan, not for

46:29.280 --> 46:33.000
anything relating to anything other than like airspace or like...

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Wow.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.440
So it's sort of like when I watched...I know what you did last summer, it kind of pissed

46:37.440 --> 46:42.600
me off that they were...the murder was some fisherman that they wronged a year ago that

46:42.600 --> 46:43.600
you never saw.

46:43.600 --> 46:45.800
So to you, Pakistan, is that fisherman.

46:45.800 --> 46:46.800
Yeah, yeah.

46:46.800 --> 46:47.800
Sorry, I haven't heard about this guy.

46:47.800 --> 46:49.800
You were like, that's fucking country, why?

46:49.800 --> 46:53.400
But there was some kind of thing, it was like, like, yeah, Pakistan was...

46:53.400 --> 46:56.760
The idea that that was a safe house that were harboring, you know, al-Qaeda or something

46:56.760 --> 46:57.760
like that, right?

46:57.760 --> 47:03.000
And or helping us, like it was like, you know, caught in between like the...was it Pakistan

47:03.000 --> 47:06.920
that had the...no, that's Jordan, Jordan was also like came to the forefront, and that's

47:06.920 --> 47:07.920
what...

47:07.920 --> 47:11.680
Jordan's gone, Pakistan, we're still hanging on to our 15 minutes.

47:11.680 --> 47:15.920
Remember the wake of 9-Eleven, like, this was like, just speaks to like the first world

47:15.920 --> 47:21.880
like, like, kind of like, I don't know, god damn it, what's the word?

47:21.880 --> 47:23.600
Ethnocentrism?

47:23.600 --> 47:29.120
Decadence, decadence, yeah.

47:29.120 --> 47:34.720
I remember sitting in a restaurant, and like, in the wake of 9-Eleven and everything, what

47:34.720 --> 47:35.720
are we going to do?

47:35.720 --> 47:39.160
There's a lot of Middle Eastern talk, a lot of officials coming forward, presidents,

47:39.160 --> 47:42.880
prime ministers, all of a sudden people who haven't thought about the Middle East in ten

47:42.880 --> 47:47.680
years are watching it on CNN and looking at like...and the king of Jordan comes out and

47:47.680 --> 47:51.640
like, he's got this wife just like sitting there eating a cheeseburger going like, she's

47:51.640 --> 47:52.640
hot.

47:52.640 --> 47:56.360
Remember the king of Jordan, it was like, oh, she's hot.

47:56.360 --> 47:57.360
She was hot.

47:57.360 --> 48:02.480
I don't know, I thought that would get a bigger laugh, like, I was saying like, there's terrorist

48:02.480 --> 48:06.200
attack happening, there's like all of this shit bubbling up, but it was like, I couldn't

48:06.200 --> 48:07.200
even...

48:07.200 --> 48:11.320
Well, what you do is you take something, you take something big and you try and digest

48:11.320 --> 48:12.320
it in the way you can.

48:12.320 --> 48:16.000
So you're trying to turn it into an HBO miniseries.

48:16.000 --> 48:27.360
Do you remember when Saddam died, when they killed Saddam, right before that, they were

48:27.360 --> 48:33.360
like, oh, he really liked Doritos, like, who, why are you telling us that?

48:33.360 --> 48:34.520
You already killed him.

48:34.520 --> 48:36.320
If you want us to like him, don't.

48:36.320 --> 48:40.880
You'd be like, listen, turns out he likes Doritos, so we're going to stay out of execution.

48:40.880 --> 48:41.880
He's not so different.

48:41.880 --> 48:45.640
They're like, we killed him bad news, he liked Doritos, just like you do.

48:45.640 --> 48:46.640
Fuck.

48:46.640 --> 48:55.960
While we're in this ticklish, sensitive, fun area, I remember you and I having a conversation

48:55.960 --> 49:00.160
because you're an actor, and you said you weren't back then, like, that was your first

49:00.160 --> 49:06.360
audition as an actor, and since then now you get a little acting career and a little, little.

49:06.360 --> 49:09.640
You know, I heard the first little.

49:09.640 --> 49:14.320
I like that it goes from the big, like, making fun of where I'm from and my tribes, to now

49:14.320 --> 49:15.840
also the person though.

49:15.840 --> 49:17.440
Yeah, now we're going to go, it's very thorough.

49:17.440 --> 49:21.840
I've seen your bed where you sleep, it's weird, it's like, it's a straw.

49:21.840 --> 49:26.240
It reminds me of home, Dan.

49:26.240 --> 49:34.000
I remember we had a conversation about like, the weird, like, like how, like, okay, a white

49:34.000 --> 49:40.760
actor in America gets sides, gets an audition, hey, they need a guy to play the male lead's

49:40.760 --> 49:44.880
best friend, he kind of wants to fuck his girlfriend, but he's half gay and he loves

49:44.880 --> 49:45.880
basketball.

49:45.880 --> 49:49.720
So you come in, and you come in and you go like, like the biggest struggle an American

49:49.720 --> 49:53.520
white actor has as you go, like, oh, this guy's kind of Freddy, so I'm going to, I'm

49:53.520 --> 49:56.880
going to, I'm going to put my spin on it, but whatever, it's not written for me.

49:56.880 --> 49:58.760
But then there's this whole other component happens.

49:58.760 --> 50:02.840
If you're Asian, if you're Latin, if you're, if you're Middle Eastern, if you're whatever

50:02.840 --> 50:10.400
the other things are, Mordor, yeah, if you're an elf, if you're a dwarf, if you're, yeah.

50:10.400 --> 50:15.240
So, I remember having a conversation that was kind of provocative and interesting, like

50:15.240 --> 50:19.560
what we were talking about, like you being, like, through no choice of your own, you're

50:19.560 --> 50:22.440
at the forefront of that, because you have to ask yourself as a person, obviously with

50:22.440 --> 50:30.520
like a 350 IQ, comes from, comes from, like, like, actually not, not a metric system, though.

50:30.520 --> 50:35.360
Not only ethnically, like, like, like, like, having this cross to bear, but actually, like,

50:35.360 --> 50:41.160
you moved here, and, and are acting over here, and now you're, you get auditions, so you

50:41.160 --> 50:45.320
go in, and it's like, you know, you imagine the kinds of things, like, like, like, we

50:45.320 --> 50:49.560
all know, like, it's like, it's like, oh, this guy's the quirky guy, like, we had a conversation

50:49.560 --> 50:54.040
about it, but I was drunk, so, like, I don't remember it, but I remember it being fascinating,

50:54.040 --> 50:59.280
maybe we could dig it up, and I'm like, Dr. Frankenstein was just so in parts together.

50:59.280 --> 51:04.000
I feel, okay, so for a long time, first of all, when I first started auditioning, it was,

51:04.000 --> 51:09.880
I was auditioning for a lot of parts, clearly, that Aziz had gotten too big for, they were

51:09.880 --> 51:14.800
clearly written in his voice, and I read, like, three cab drivers named Aziz, I fucking

51:14.800 --> 51:15.800
swear that happened.

51:15.800 --> 51:23.280
It's a fun name, Aziz, yeah, it's, yeah, you imagine him swinging tree to tree, Dan.

51:23.280 --> 51:29.160
Oh, sorry, cave to cave.

51:29.160 --> 51:30.160
Thank you.

51:30.160 --> 51:36.640
Well, I think what it was, yeah, so I do a lot of auditions now where it's still, it's

51:36.640 --> 51:42.200
getting better, but a lot of people will sort of basically tell me to up my accent without

51:42.200 --> 51:45.240
saying it, so I'll, like, do the audition, they're like, oh, that was great, that was

51:45.240 --> 51:52.720
great, could you do it a little, like, even more, like, even more exaggerated, I'm like,

51:52.720 --> 51:58.880
first of all, I'm not doing anything, this is how I talk, and I made a decision, like,

51:58.880 --> 52:02.640
two years ago where I was like, I'm not going to change my accent for any of these auditions,

52:02.640 --> 52:06.080
so I've had a lot of auditions go well, and they're like, all right, now try it this way,

52:06.080 --> 52:10.720
and I get sort of upset, and it becomes, it's kind of obvious, and so I have it, but then

52:10.720 --> 52:13.480
I see, fucking, there's so many people, I don't want to name names, but there's people

52:13.480 --> 52:19.040
that you know who are brown actors who I'll audition with, and I'll, I can fucking hear

52:19.040 --> 52:25.320
them in there, like, pissing on their legacy, like, all doing all that shit, it fucking

52:25.320 --> 52:26.840
pisses me off so much.

52:26.840 --> 52:30.480
We're talking about Danny Peudy, right?

52:30.480 --> 52:35.600
Fucking Danny Peudy, but it always gets me, that really angers me, it's like, it's like

52:35.600 --> 52:39.000
sort of like, they're like scabs, you know, like, come on, we're all in this together,

52:39.000 --> 52:40.920
don't fucking, and then they get the part.

52:40.920 --> 52:41.920
Right.

52:41.920 --> 52:42.920
Wow.

52:42.920 --> 52:47.560
My ex-girlfriend Erin Hill, when I was dating her, she was a media studies, getting her

52:47.560 --> 52:51.440
master's degree, going for her PhD, and she would spend all this time going through these

52:51.440 --> 52:55.960
archives, and she uncovered this thing from the, probably the 40s or 50s, this Native

52:55.960 --> 53:03.440
American actor, who, his head shot was like, it was signed, and he had a, he had a bowler

53:03.440 --> 53:06.560
hat with a feather in it, and it was here running down his face.

53:06.560 --> 53:10.760
Yeah, well, that was the 70s, that was when we actually started to go, like, hey, these

53:10.760 --> 53:17.360
guys have clout, now that they're all dead, like, what if you made them cry?

53:17.360 --> 53:25.520
Back then, it was still like, hey, they're funny, their houses are pointy.

53:25.520 --> 53:33.880
His head shot was like, signed, like, me wantum commission for agentum, like, much good wantum

53:33.880 --> 53:38.280
for, you know, like, like, like, obviously, you can tell the guy was like, like, a good

53:38.280 --> 53:39.280
guy.

53:39.280 --> 53:41.280
Yeah, he's like, how do I get the part?

53:41.280 --> 53:42.280
Yeah.

53:42.280 --> 53:49.640
And it's like, hero or villain, or the whole Hollywood shuffle thing, like, but it's, the

53:49.640 --> 53:55.080
interesting thing about it is the lack of, like, easy empirical truth, because if I'm

53:55.080 --> 54:01.880
an African-American actor, and I, like, like, why don't I, for instance, have the right,

54:01.880 --> 54:07.440
the same right that a Caucasian actor would have to affect a Brooklyn accent, or take

54:07.440 --> 54:11.760
advantage of the fact that I'm from Jersey, or, or, or, or that I have, that I know what

54:11.760 --> 54:16.840
a Southern person sounds like, to, in order to try to get some part, or according to Francis

54:16.840 --> 54:18.840
or whatever they're doing.

54:18.840 --> 54:23.200
The, if you're, now you're a black person and you're going in as an actor, and it's

54:23.200 --> 54:27.040
like, well, this guy's, he's a little groovier, he's a little blacker than you're doing it,

54:27.040 --> 54:29.240
and that's not how you talk, but you're an actor.

54:29.240 --> 54:33.480
That's the, it's, it's, it's a terrible thing to put someone in the, in the position of,

54:33.480 --> 54:35.800
your, your, your craft is supposed to be pretending.

54:35.800 --> 54:39.440
You're supposed to be able to pin medals to your chest to the extent that you're able

54:39.440 --> 54:45.400
to portray of, or, you know, a, a, a, a, a different, different aspects of yourself and

54:45.400 --> 54:47.200
other people, imaginary people.

54:47.200 --> 54:52.440
We give awards to people who do it, who, who, who, who remove us from reality more.

54:52.440 --> 54:57.160
And so now, even though you didn't buy a ticket to that ride, here you are as an actor, when

54:57.160 --> 55:01.200
all the other actors get to just go, I either get the part or I don't, you have to, you

55:01.200 --> 55:05.680
have to tweak it in your head and go, well, I either get the part or I don't, and there's

55:05.680 --> 55:10.280
way less parts, and on top of that, I have to fucking act like the, I have to.

55:10.280 --> 55:14.600
Like the one Indian guy, the one, like brown guy, the people that come, although the couple

55:14.600 --> 55:18.800
of things, one, it's, I feel it changing, like I've been getting parts that were written

55:18.800 --> 55:20.840
for white guys and stuff, so it's changing.

55:20.840 --> 55:26.480
And I do think, honestly, that the character Abed on community did sort of change things

55:26.480 --> 55:30.640
because it was a kind of brown guy that we hadn't seen on TV before.

55:30.640 --> 55:34.160
And so when I read that, I was like, oh, when I watched the show, I was like, well, this

55:34.160 --> 55:35.160
is great.

55:35.160 --> 55:36.160
This is, you know, a new kind of brown guy.

55:36.160 --> 55:37.160
This is going to change.

55:37.160 --> 55:40.720
And then I read, like, the next pilot season, I read, like, five scripts that had, like,

55:40.720 --> 55:43.200
basically Abed with different names.

55:43.200 --> 55:46.680
A friend of mine that I won't name because I want to get him troubled, read a pilot and

55:46.680 --> 55:53.880
the, it's, I don't even want to describe it because I don't want anyone to get in trouble.

55:53.880 --> 55:58.840
But, like, there's a, according to this friend of mine, there's literally a point in the

55:58.840 --> 56:03.760
script where the other characters are introduced to this kind of wacky ensemble.

56:03.760 --> 56:08.640
And literally the names of the characters are Asian lady and fat guy and, like, they

56:08.640 --> 56:09.640
didn't do it.

56:09.640 --> 56:12.160
It's like, whoa, it got home by three today, huh?

56:12.160 --> 56:13.160
Oh, crazy.

56:13.160 --> 56:17.360
So, and I really think that if you're, you know, since the Harmontown audience, I assume

56:17.360 --> 56:21.920
is 90% writers and 85% 25-year-old writers.

56:21.920 --> 56:28.240
Like, I think that the way to break the cycle starts at the, starts at what I used to call

56:28.240 --> 56:29.240
the typewriter.

56:29.240 --> 56:35.040
Like, you, I think the key to it is, like, you have to avoid the temptation.

56:35.040 --> 56:40.200
Like, like, with the Abed character in community, that was the one exception in that script

56:40.200 --> 56:45.800
where you actually bothered to explicitly say, he says he's half Palestinian or something

56:45.800 --> 56:46.800
like that.

56:46.800 --> 56:50.600
Like, it was, it was in part real Abed is half Palestinian and felt important to the

56:50.600 --> 56:52.480
character to me for some reason.

56:52.480 --> 56:53.480
Maybe I was right.

56:53.480 --> 56:54.480
Maybe I was wrong.

56:54.480 --> 56:57.760
It makes sense because he's a guy who's half, so he's sort of obsessed with pop culture,

56:57.760 --> 57:02.160
but then there's also this other part of him that sort of, it sort of makes him an observer,

57:02.160 --> 57:05.840
even though it's not specifically a racial thing, but somebody who's sort of straddling

57:05.840 --> 57:07.080
two cultures like that.

57:07.080 --> 57:12.360
Maybe, I mean, in retrospect, but not, I mean, he could have been a white guy and it wouldn't

57:12.360 --> 57:13.360
have been.

57:13.360 --> 57:15.520
There was one storyline with his dad that was a little specific to that.

57:15.520 --> 57:18.960
In retrospect, he definitely could have been a white guy and he surely could have been

57:18.960 --> 57:23.440
half Indian, half Polish, which Deity Pudi is, but at the time there was this whole,

57:23.440 --> 57:26.440
not the whole brouhaha, but it's just like, I monitor Twitter and it's like, there's

57:26.440 --> 57:29.760
all kinds of different viewpoints that come in and some, you know, justifiably some come

57:29.760 --> 57:33.840
in and go, why, why do you have an Indian guy playing a half Indian guy playing a half

57:33.840 --> 57:34.840
Arabic guy?

57:34.840 --> 57:36.040
Like, like, what are you doing?

57:36.040 --> 57:37.720
So all brown people, blah, blah, blah.

57:37.720 --> 57:38.720
Very justifiable, absolutely.

57:38.720 --> 57:40.800
But it didn't shake down that way.

57:40.800 --> 57:47.080
You create a character, you say, okay, this is based on my friend, Real Abed, whose dad

57:47.080 --> 57:50.960
was Palestinian and whose mom was whatever, Nordic or something, and who had this very

57:50.960 --> 57:53.360
specific backstory to him, you know?

57:53.360 --> 57:59.040
His dad was like, like, it had really a lot to do with the relationship with his dad,

57:59.040 --> 58:00.040
which we did explore.

58:00.040 --> 58:07.760
Like, his dad was not a fundamentalist Muslim, but a passionate one, a stern guy, a kind

58:07.760 --> 58:12.840
of great Santini type in my head, and that would be because father and son stories are

58:12.840 --> 58:15.280
very important to male characters.

58:15.280 --> 58:20.000
That was important, and it was like, race isn't important, that's an artificial construct,

58:20.000 --> 58:24.880
but nationality of your parents could be called an important thing.

58:24.880 --> 58:29.960
So then Danny Pudi walks in, fucking blows the roof off the room, okay, like, can we

58:29.960 --> 58:34.600
stop talking about how good he was in the audition?

58:34.600 --> 58:38.360
We get it, he got the part, then.

58:38.360 --> 58:39.360
You know what?

58:39.360 --> 58:41.560
I was really upset when I didn't get it, but when I saw the show, I was like, oh, the

58:41.560 --> 58:42.560
right guy got it.

58:42.560 --> 58:43.560
Anyway, go ahead.

58:43.560 --> 58:44.560
No, I think that's the great thing about casting.

58:44.560 --> 58:51.480
Yeah, it's like, no one's gonna feel bad about this, like, let's all watch the fireworks.

58:51.480 --> 58:55.240
But then, so later on, it's like, the tweet's coming, and it really vexed me, because I'm

58:55.240 --> 58:59.280
like, I've got all this white guilt, and like, I want to be Norman Lair, I don't want to

58:59.280 --> 59:04.360
be, I don't want to be a bad person, I want to use my talent right, I want to contribute,

59:04.360 --> 59:10.080
I want to make people happy, and people are going like, why is this brown guy playing

59:10.080 --> 59:15.280
a different kind of brown guy so torn between like, this is a slippery slope, where you go

59:15.280 --> 59:16.280
like, oh.

59:16.280 --> 59:19.280
By the way, that's not an issue to me, or any, I mean, that's, they're really, really-

59:19.280 --> 59:23.280
I think it's a justifiable issue to some people, but it all depends on where you, it's all

59:23.280 --> 59:30.000
depends on the context, like if you, it really is, it's such a, it's such a strange time

59:30.000 --> 59:33.880
to be alive, and I think, I think, I think that there is no, there is no magic wand to

59:33.880 --> 59:38.200
wave over it, no rule, but I definitely think it starts with people writing scripts where

59:38.200 --> 59:44.360
you gotta, you gotta detach yourself from, like it's, it's like, you just go like, oh,

59:44.360 --> 59:49.760
this character is amazing, he's this big fat black guy, and he, but he talks like a little

59:49.760 --> 59:51.600
girl, isn't that a great character?

59:51.600 --> 59:57.040
No, it's not, like, that's a great actor if that guy comes in, and plays the character

59:57.040 --> 59:58.040
of-

59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.840
Well, how important would it be to you if, if you changed the gender of people, like-

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.920
Well, that's where, yeah, where do you stop, and that's, like, like, like, do we, do we,

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:09.680
do we progress to a weird Gene Roddenberry age, where screenplays are like, ones and

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:14.480
zeros, and you're kind of like, the, the rook has a problem with the pawn, you know, and

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:18.440
they said, I don't know, and does, and does that mitigate creativity, does that mitigate

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.600
passion, obviously the answer is yes, because to the extent that you do that, then some

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:29.120
punk rock writer's gonna go, two black dudes walk in, fucking script rules, you know, whatever,

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.640
so we don't, we don't have to keep talking about that, it's because there's no, there

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:36.160
is no, there is no, there is no finish line for that, I think, I think the discourse is

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:40.440
the valuable thing, I, I, I think that people talking about it is the only place that's

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.440
very-

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.080
I think as long as you're aware of that, you know, I think a lot of times, a lot of scripts

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.240
I read, it's just funny, I can read it, I'm like, oh, the line isn't funny, it's funny,

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:52.840
because whoever wrote it in his head, heard it in an Apu accent or whatever, that happens

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:59.520
a lot, and I've gone into, I, I don't want to, ah, this is too specific, alright, okay,

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:07.200
so, this is very specific, can I sort of tell you later to take it out if I decide, is that

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.200
okay?

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.200
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.200
Well, I had this one, you raped a baby.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.200
I did this one movie.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.200
What'd you say?

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.200
You raped a baby.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:20.080
T-T-T-T-T-L-D-R, yeah, yeah, I wanted to rape a black baby, but then, you know, I was

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.920
like, well, it doesn't matter, it was like Hispanic or whatever.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.920
Some kind of-

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:26.920
Snickers.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.920
What?

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.080
I'm sorry, we can't edit it out, that's where we did our Snickers spot.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.880
They pay us a lot of money.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.120
Shirt design t-shirts, so soft.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:44.120
This, say, we're brought to you by the Misco.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.960
I, ah, I, this movie that I did not audition for that seen my stuff that I liked, and it

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.120
wasn't a huge part, so I went in, and the first day of shooting, they were like, so

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.720
how thick are you going to do your accent?

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.320
And I was like, well, I'm not going to do it thick at all.

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.320
And they were like, what do you mean?

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.080
It's written, it's supposed to be a thick Indian accent.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:02.480
I was like, well, I sort of have the 10 year out of Pakistan accent, and that's what it's

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.480
going to be.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.720
So it became this huge thing, ah, producers were calling in stuff, and I called my agent,

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.840
and I was like, you know, I think they're going to fire me off this movie.

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:16.200
And I was like, I know I can make this part funny being myself with the lines, but I don't

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.520
know if I can make it funny if you want me to do like a crazy accent.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.920
And then I just, I was like, just let me do one the way I talk, and then we can talk after

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.920
that.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.080
And it worked, and it worked great, and they were like, alright, just do what you're doing.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.560
So I think a lot of people are just scared of writing parts or imagining parts that don't

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.640
fit into whatever, you know, their little boxes or whatever.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.640
It's hard to see.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:39.560
You get, you know, in the beginning, like there was a, now there are a lot of black

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.800
actor characters on TV, and they're all sort of varied and different.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.000
And I'm sure there's still strides to be made.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.760
But there was an actor, Emily was telling me about this, there was an actor in, when

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.320
was it, Emily?

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.960
His name was Sleep and Eat, is what he went by.

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:58.400
And his whole mythology, sleep aid, sleep and eat, like sleep and eat, he was an actor,

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.880
and his whole thing was just give me a place to sleep and something to eat, and I'll work

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.480
for you like he totally played up that whole.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.200
He could step or fetch it.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.440
Yeah, it really was like that.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.440
It was like that.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.040
And so, so, and that was...

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:16.000
He wanted Wampum for his, yeah, that wasn't that long ago, you know, and it's changed.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.360
So yeah, so on one side of it, yeah, you got writers, writers have got to do everything

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:24.760
they can to go like, okay, I'm going to create a character that's based on an emotional component.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.760
And if there's biographical components that comes out of the watch, and then on the actor's

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.880
side, it's like, I think if you're the Meryl Streep of Pakistani actors, then you could

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.680
maybe fuck around with it, they go like, yeah, lay the accent on a little more thick, you

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:41.080
go like, okay, I'm going to do that based on my decades of studying all of these different

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.080
kinds of...

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.080
You know what I mean?

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:47.240
Yeah, for me, it was, I decided not to do it because it was hard for me to parse which

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:50.840
parts were the guy with a thick accent, and it made sense in the story, it made sense

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.480
for the character, and which parts were, because that was going mostly for comedies, which parts

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.600
were a thick accent just because the guy thought it would be funnier for a thick accent Indian

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.880
guy to say a motherfucker or whatever, you know?

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.200
Or talk about Star Wars, which was like a big thing before...

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.200
Oh yeah.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.200
That was why Abed was like an important thing to me, because it was like, I want him to

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.960
be the foremost expert, yes, he's going to be talking about pop culture, it's not funny

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:17.400
because he doesn't have an accent, he's, it's like before that, I mean he has an accent

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.400
that's the American accent.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:23.720
Let me ask you a question, when Batman fights Bob the Goon in issue number three, it's funny,

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:26.680
oh, because listen to how he talks, he's not supposed to know about Star Wars, and that's

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:31.320
like, that to me is like, kind of like a black guy in a dress, it's like all the part of

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:35.800
the same like tree, it's like, okay, there's nothing, the character's not real, the character's

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800
like a...

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.760
Yeah, but then also when you think of something like nerd, the way that nerds are written

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:45.480
a lot of times are also in a box, so you know, Star Wars is a good example, I read so many

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.000
scripts with someone, is it talk about Star Wars, that's like, oh, they're a nerd, they're

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.640
a nerd, and I would always, if I'm working on something and there's a Star Wars reference,

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:57.160
I'm like, that feels so generic, that feels like you're just saying sci-fi, make it more

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.600
specific, make it, you know, Lord of the Rings or something.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:05.840
So for everything you do, there's these sort of pointers, like little ways that you put

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:13.040
people in boxes, I can't, I believe you guys are here still.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:16.000
Be a better writer and be a better actor, and we'll all meet somewhere in between.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
All right, speaking of characters and, let's pull my pants down.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.680
Yeah, Dan, whip that dick out on these people.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.680
I want to show you these two characters, Clifford and Northumberland.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.680
Let's bring Spencer...

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.680
They're classics?

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:31.680
They're classics.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.320
Spencer, Spencer, will you come to the stage?

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:38.320
Spencer Crittenden is in...

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:44.920
Spencer Crittenden, Detective Master extraordinaire.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:50.960
Hey, I have something to ask Kumeil while Spencer sets up, because we don't do anything

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.960
like very...

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:57.600
We're not a big, planning podcast, and as a person, I don't make a lot of plans and contact

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:04.880
a lot of people, but this is your third time up here, and are you bummed out that you have

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.360
to keep coming up, or are you...

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:09.480
No, I love being on stage with you guys, it's always super fun.

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.720
Okay, because your character can like fall off a cliff, or also like, you don't have

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.720
to...

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:14.720
Like, there's no pressure.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.720
I know.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:21.920
But if your character had maybe a little bit more...

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.920
You give us more...

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.920
What's the word I'm looking for, Dan?

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920
I don't know.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.920
Spice.

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.920
A little more...

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:34.720
You know what's funny, could you cave it up a little more?

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.720
Cave it up!

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.720
What's funny is...

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.800
Kiko, cave it up.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.040
For black actors, there is a phrase that always says, be more street.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.880
That's what they say, or more urban.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.320
For my people, there isn't that word yet.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.320
Attitude, attitude.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.320
Yeah, attitude.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.320
Black people hear a lot.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.320
For us, there aren't...

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:53.880
There isn't like a set number of like adjectives that you can use to really...

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:54.880
There must be some.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.240
There's certainly in casting offices...

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.200
They'll say even more...

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.920
Some people are stereotypical, obviously.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.000
They say, yeah, that one's harsh.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.960
One woman was like, all right, that's good, but even more funny.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.600
But the way she said it was like, you know what I mean?

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.600
Like...

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.800
You know, like you people.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.800
Could you be less...

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:19.800
Could you be less six, ten, and more, I don't know, seven, eleven?

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:20.800
Yeah.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.800
Yeah.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.320
You're at an eight, need you at a seven, eleven.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.080
What I'm getting right now is like a B plus poo.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.080
Yeah.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.080
I'm like a...

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.080
They really want you to do...

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.080
Like a B poo.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:36.280
They really want you to do the Appu accent, which is voiced by a white guy.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.280
Hilarious.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.800
That idea of an Indian accent is literally a white guy.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.800
Oh.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.800
Anyway.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.800
But you know what?

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.800
It is getting better.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:45.800
What did you think about...

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.800
God damn it.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:47.800
What's his name?

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:48.800
He's an awesome actor, a monk.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:49.800
Tony Shalu.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:50.800
Tony Shalu.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:51.800
What did...

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.800
Did you see Quick Change with Bill Murray?

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:53.800
I don't remember.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:54.800
I saw it when I was a little kid.

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.800
He plays a cab driver in it.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.720
Bad, bad, bad first impression.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.560
Like, and he plays a cab driver who is very...

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.120
He doesn't speak English.

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.120
And he's like...

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.120
It's just this farce.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.560
Like, Bill Murray's trying to get out of town.

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.680
He robbed a bank and now he can't get out of New York.

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:15.680
And one of the complications is, like, Jason Robards plays as a detective, he's one step

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.840
behind Bill Murray and he's trying to pick up his trail.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:24.280
Tony Shalu played this, like, just on paper, like, he's a Middle Eastern cab driver.

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:28.080
He's one of the many things about New York that prevents you from getting out after a

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.920
bank robbery.

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:35.920
And so he's witnessed to the fact that Randy Quaid, like, fell out of the cab, blah, blah,

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:36.920
blah, blah.

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:41.120
Bill Murray is interrogating him, like, where did they go, where did they go?

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.920
And he's doing, like, this mime stick, like, on paper, like, it couldn't be more, like...

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.760
He's going, Bluff Tony, Bluff Tony!

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.440
And he's, like, miming, honking a horn.

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.560
He's trying to tell them through his, you know...

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:58.320
How is he a cab driver if we can't understand English?

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:04.040
I remember the first time realizing, like, watching Short Circuit, Fisher Stevens, and

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.560
being like, that's not...

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.560
Yeah.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.960
I don't know what we look like, and it's not that.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.960
The...

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.960
I just...

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.960
I...

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:12.960
I...

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:18.360
I just always, like, like, if you watch it, go rent Quick Change, so it's a really, like,

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.280
I don't know, it's an amazing little, like, three in the morning movie, Snuggle Up with

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:28.080
Your Girlfriend, or Boyfriend, Open Minded Night, and, or your dog, but not if...

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.080
Whatever.

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.080
It doesn't...

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.440
Don't fuck your dog, that's what we're saying.

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:35.680
And also, I'm not equating bestiality with homosexuality, or with heterosexuality.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:38.960
No, no, no, those are three distinct types of people.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:39.960
Cut...

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.960
Cuttle up with whatever you want to cuddle up with.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:42.960
Or don't cuddle.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:43.960
Hang upside down like a bat.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:44.960
Don't cuddle.

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:45.960
Don't cuddle.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.560
The point is not what you're doing, the point is the movie.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.400
There's no wrong way to watch Quick Change is what you're saying.

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.400
I don't know.

01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:57.200
I think fucking your dog and watching it might be...

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.120
I think that's a bigotative view, to say that.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.120
I say...

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.120
Yeah, what if the dog's into it?

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.120
There are people...

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.120
Why is that a crime?

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.800
Well, a lot of people are going to hear this podcast, and some of them may want to rape

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.640
an animal while they watch Quick Change, and I say...

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.640
Well, I'm raping...

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.640
Well, I say...

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.640
I say good for you.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.640
No, rape...

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:13.640
Rape sensual.

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.640
Rape sensual.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:15.640
And what...

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.140
The important thing is that you watch Quick Change.

01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:20.160
The animals aren't important here.

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.160
Different people...

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.160
Yeah.

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.160
Different priorities.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.160
Right?

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.160
A stereotypical Middle Eastern character while watching Quick Change.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.000
Just watch Quick Change.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:33.960
Tony Shalub walks into this character that is written as a sand trap of stereotypicality.

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.960
Sand trap.

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.960
He's no punny.

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:36.960
Wow.

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:37.960
I love that play.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:38.960
No words.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:39.960
Jesus Christ.

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:44.480
Okay, the reason I said that is because I didn't see it as a thing, because I don't think

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.480
it was.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.480
Really?

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.480
Golf?

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:48.480
So...

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.480
Parts of you saw it.

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.480
You're a big golfer.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.840
Dan, this is the first golf finale you used in the entire run of the show.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:57.640
Well, if racism is that unconscious, then hey, well, yeah.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:09.800
He's trying to curry favor with the police officer.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.680
Tony Shalub, who is like, like, I...

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:18.920
Then you can salvage this.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:19.920
Go watch it.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.680
It's the scene Jason Robards is talking to this guy, this character that may as well be

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:27.120
Mickey Rooney in Breakfast in Tiffany's.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.200
Oh, dear.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:34.520
But Tony Shalub, like, who didn't say no to that audition, I'm not at all flying in the

01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:38.920
face of anything that we've said, but it's an interesting thing to look at, because

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:52.160
Tony Shalub, like, he made some decision walking under the set that, look, I'm an actor, and

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.880
I'm going to make people feel this character's pain and frustration.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.560
I'm not going to make them hear his funny accent.

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:04.880
And here's the only thing I can remember from that scene is, like, Jesus Christ, this guy

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.000
is so scared.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.440
And so, like, he's alone and he doesn't know what's happening, like, it breaks you to the

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.200
brink of tears.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:18.680
It's just supposed to be this stupid gag about this guy that talks funny, but I'm telling

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:19.680
you, like, take a look at it.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.680
Tell me if I'm wrong.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:21.680
Email me, whatever.

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:22.680
You know what I mean?

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.400
Next time in town, we just screened a quick change.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.760
I can guarantee you, we'll get Tony Shalub for that one.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.920
Oh, my God, that would be amazing.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:35.880
Another thing I remember the first time being, like, watching this, and as a kid, and being

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:39.240
like, that's not right, was, I think it was bad boys, where there's a part where they're

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:43.280
talking to, like, a clerk at basically a 7-Eleven, whatever.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:44.280
Do you remember that scene?

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.440
And the guy calls him a mother bitch.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:51.340
And I was like, aw, we know everybody, if you know enough to know that bitch is a swear

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:55.880
word and that mother something is a swear word, you know it's mother fucker.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.080
Mother bitch, nobody's ever said that.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.680
It's funny, it's funny.

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:00.680
You guys are like mad libs.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:01.680
You don't know what you're doing.

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.680
Yeah.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:10.160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, my goodness, chicken, I burned all your motherless dog, I put a goat

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.280
in your foot, you chowed, chowed punter.

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:19.280
Spencer, keep it the fuck down, would you?

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.280
Enough.

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.280
All right, we need enough.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:22.280
Sorry.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:27.560
We need a stool and a mic for, for, for Sedona, Mulraine, Mulraine's side.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.080
Sharon McGathey for the stage, would you?

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:36.560
Spencer, get us up to date in our, in our campaign, would you please?

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.560
Yeah, did anything happen last night?

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.560
What can you guys, can you guys?

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.560
Huh?

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.560
Did anything happen last time?

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:51.920
I have, I have a vague memory, I, I, I, I was in bed knitting Jeff a scarf, did anything

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:52.920
happen?

01:13:52.920 --> 01:14:00.160
Oh yeah, I, I, I fucked your horse, but also I fucked a bird and I fucked a squirrel, I

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.320
fucked a lot of things.

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.440
You fucked a half a dead zombie?

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.760
I fucked, yeah, I was, I don't know if you fucked it in the appropriate part or if you

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:11.040
just fucked the, where it got sliced, it was unclear.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:16.120
Adam Goldberg was, was texting me last week during the show, live texting Jeff just, Jeff

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.640
just fucked your horse.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.920
And then Dustin Marshall was like, not a real horse, you know.

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:24.920
Well, Spencer, take it away.

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:30.800
The horse is as real as the fucking it got, I mean, relatively speaking.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.800
When we last met, our heroes had been following Christopher, the bard to the fabled ruins

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.200
of Mercule, home of the soul of growth.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.880
After traveling for a time, day shifted to night, and before long, the sound of unsettling

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:47.120
moans and wails echoed throughout the forest.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:53.800
Less than cognizant of the impending threat, our heroes took a rest break, discussing music,

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:59.520
studying ancient tomes and fucking wildlife, until, until a grip of zombies were all but

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.720
upon them.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:07.720
Mulraine, who in a fey mood bargained with the party over her use of the entangle spell,

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:12.000
eventually decided to use it and captured several zombies.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.640
After making quick, several concessions, the party waited for the forest to do its bidding.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.600
After entangling their foes, the two made, the, the barbarian, with the help of the new

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:28.720
blood spell cast by Sharpie, made quick work of the remaining zombies' stranglers.

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.680
This is all going to shit.

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:36.240
The party pressed on before arriving at an ancient crumbling ruin deep within the forests

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.160
of Twila.

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.560
So if you can see, I'm not even on the music, I'm so sorry everybody.

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:45.560
You got, you got 26 seconds.

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:46.560
How are you feeling?

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.060
Does that how you're feeling?

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:54.040
Walking through the ruins, you notice several stone statues before you, lurking and guarding

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.040
the ruins within.

01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:05.440
Spencer everybody.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.440
Thanks audience.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.440
All right.

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.440
Okay.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:16.480
So it's Quark, Sharpie, Mulraine and Chris de Burgh, who, uh, he wrote, he wrote and performed

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.480
The Lady in Red.

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.480
Yeah.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.480
Huge hit.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.480
Yeah.

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:24.200
Careers kind of falling on, you know, maybe a bit of a, a bit of a low.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.680
I would say so.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.960
You certainly didn't expect that you'd find yourself here.

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.160
No, no, no.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:33.920
I thought once I had Lady in Red, I was like, oh, the world is more like, I looked in the

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.320
mirror and I was like, this shit's too easy.

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:37.320
Yeah.

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.320
Sergeant Pepper.

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.320
Now here you are.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:41.040
You're standing outside of a stone ruin.

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.200
Uh, who knows what's going to happen?

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.200
Yeah.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.200
I've heard horses being fucked.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.200
Yeah.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.200
Shit's, shit's gone off track.

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.200
All right.

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.040
So, uh, I examined surrounding Spencer.

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:58.600
The masonry appears ancient, part of some long past ruined civilization.

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.960
Most prominence are worn and crumbling statues stood on stone pedestals bearing the likeness

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.280
of humanoids with bestial heads.

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.360
They appear to be dragon heads.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:11.840
The statues flank a well-worn stone floor that leads about 60 feet down to a thick

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:16.640
stand of tightly knit trees between the trees as a small crevice in the dead center of the

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.520
clump of trees.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.120
I find, uh, sorry.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.040
No, that's, I was, I was just saying go.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.040
Sorry.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.040
Sorry.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.040
It's okay.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.040
It's okay, Spencer.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.040
Are we cool?

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.040
I, my self-esteem is just.

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.040
What's going on, Spencer?

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.040
You seem a little down.

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.040
Spencer, you're a true dungeon master.

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.040
What's going on, Spencer?

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.040
You're the best.

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:34.040
What are you talking about?

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.040
Thanks, guys.

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.040
Oh, yeah.

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.040
I couldn't tell you.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:38.040
What's going on?

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.040
I had a great, I had a great day with Nolan.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.040
Um, you know, I, I had.

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.040
Christopher?

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.040
I wish.

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.040
Yeah.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.040
What a name drop that would be.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:46.040
He's just like, he's just out there.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.040
With Nolan.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.040
No.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.040
Sitting on top of the Hollywood stand.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.040
Yeah.

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.040
We're in talks for a fourth Batman.

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.040
What if this H was in another H?

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.040
Christopher, you're amazing.

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.040
Yeah.

01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:02.760
What was the question?

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:03.760
Who is Nolan?

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:05.760
What?

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.760
He's, he's there.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.760
Oh.

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760
Spencer, you don't see yourself tonight.

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.760
What's going on?

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:10.760
Yeah.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:11.760
No.

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.760
Uh, we ate at Pink's Hot Dogs.

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:13.760
Uh-oh.

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:14.760
Okay.

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:17.760
Did you get the, did you get the Andui dog?

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.480
I couldn't even tell you what I got.

01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:23.080
It was like, I thought I was going to get something and then I saw these little squares

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.760
that said try these other things and I tried one of the other things.

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.760
You mean menus?

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:27.760
Spencer?

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:28.760
No, menus are lists.

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:29.760
These are squares.

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:30.760
What's the problem?

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:36.760
The problem is that the hot dog was too big.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:41.760
You might have just wanted a bite of the hot dog.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.760
I'm still, what?

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:48.760
Are you saying that your stomach is a little turmoil right now?

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:49.760
No.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.760
Are you shitting like a goose right now?

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.760
That's already, I'm past that phase.

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:54.760
Right.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:55.760
That's done.

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.760
Spencer, did you, did you have a good time at Dan and my Oscar party?

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:00.760
Yeah.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:04.760
You know how to throw a party, Aaron.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.760
Uh, all right.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:07.760
Well noted.

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.760
I guess I'm always looking for validation at the party.

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.760
That was a good line reading.

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:13.760
Let's try it again.

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:14.760
Yeah.

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:21.760
This time, could you be before, uh, he's been to the same websites that Adam Goldberg

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:22.760
is going to.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:23.760
I wasn't fishing.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:24.760
I wasn't fishing.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.760
I really enjoyed the peanut butter cake.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.760
It was good.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:27.760
Yeah.

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:28.760
I made peanut butter cake.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:29.760
Yeah.

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:33.760
They don't have to be separate, uh, uh, things that make you equally happy.

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:36.760
Like you can actually have peanut butter and cake at the same time.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.760
It was our tea day and I was like, Dan, what do you want?

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.760
He was like, meh, peanut butter cake.

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.760
I was like, that's not real.

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:43.760
And then I Googled it.

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.760
It was very real.

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:50.760
And I do admit I made it up, but I knew if you Googled it, you, I know there's going

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:53.760
to be a thing because it's going to be blowjob lollipop.

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.760
Well, I mean, that's already a real thing.

01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:58.760
Every lollipop's a blowjob lollipop.

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.760
40 years of chronic masturbation.

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.760
If you Google it, it is there.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:07.760
I knew peanut butter cake would be there if, if I can like cake farts is there.

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:08.760
Oh man.

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:14.760
Um, I find my horse Coco, uh, sitting at the bottom of a shower.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:20.760
Wait, my memory's a little foggy, but I, I, I'm pretty sure at some point it became

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.760
consensual with Coco, right?

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:23.760
It became consensual.

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.760
That's the rapiest thing anyone has ever said.

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:27.760
No, no.

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.760
She stopped resisting.

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.760
It became consensual.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.760
She stopped crying.

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.760
I did not rape Coco.

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.760
I fucked Coco and Coco dug it.

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:37.760
Did she?

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:38.760
Okay.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.760
Spencer, what was Coco's stance on this?

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:48.760
If I recall, Coco, uh, her, her, her Winnie's, uh, her, her, her name means yay.

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:56.760
She, that is the best horse rape joke I've ever heard.

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:57.760
Oh my God.

01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:00.760
Oh my God.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.760
Shows over.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.760
Um, best horse rape joke ever.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.760
Yeah.

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:08.760
Name means yay.

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:09.760
Name means yay.

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.760
That's pretty good.

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:14.760
Meanwhile, statistically 11 people in this room have been raped.

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.760
Uh, by Jeff, by me last, last week.

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.760
And they fucking loved it.

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.760
Halfway through.

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:23.760
They're not starting liking it.

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.760
The horse, the horse.

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:26.760
This is important.

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:27.760
Where, where's it consensual?

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:28.760
This is very.

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:29.760
The horse did orgasm.

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:30.760
Call the episode name means yay.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.760
Can we, can we make that the name of the episode?

01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:33.760
I'm in favor of that.

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:34.760
Yeah.

01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:35.760
I don't know.

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.760
I don't know.

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:37.760
Are you rolling a dice to see who?

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.760
I randomly determined that it was consensual.

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:40.760
It was consensual, he says.

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:41.760
It was consensual?

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:42.760
Yeah.

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:44.760
See, one through three would have been non-consensual.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:45.760
I rolled a four through six.

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:46.760
So it was barely.

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:47.760
Yeah.

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:48.760
Barely consensual.

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:52.760
It was, it was critical, it wasn't critical consensuality.

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:55.760
She's had better.

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:59.760
I'm a gnome.

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.760
It's not the size of the barbarian.

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.760
It's the motion of the sword.

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.760
It's the motion of the potion.

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:11.760
She thought the, the wind was blowing strong.

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:12.760
Okay.

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:13.760
Well, no, that's good news.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:14.760
That's good news.

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:15.760
Yeah.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:16.760
Well, fine.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:17.760
Well, fantastic.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.760
I don't remember.

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:19.760
You don't remember?

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.760
Right.

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:21.760
Right.

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.760
Right.

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.760
Right.

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:24.760
Okay.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:25.760
So I led them here, right?

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:26.760
Yeah.

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:27.760
Yeah.

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.760
You were, you were leading them here.

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:29.760
Zombies happened.

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:30.760
You took care of those.

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:31.760
Then you came around this room.

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:32.760
Yeah.

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:33.760
I killed, I hit a zombie.

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:34.760
Yeah.

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:35.760
It was my first hit in many years.

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:36.760
Chris.

01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:37.760
Chris.

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:38.760
Chris.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:39.760
Chris, let it go, man.

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:40.760
You think it's, you're hung up on this.

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:44.760
Chris, as you're traveling on this journey, do you have any

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.760
sound track running in your mind?

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:47.760
Yeah.

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:48.760
Yeah.

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:49.760
What's happening right now?

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.760
It's lady in red.

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:52.760
All right.

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.760
We're looking down a flight of stairs.

01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:55.760
What?

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.760
Down, it's done a flight of stairs.

01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.760
Like I, I'm not a visual.

01:22:58.760 --> 01:22:59.760
Okay.

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:02.760
There's, there's two, there's four statues to on either side of this path.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:07.760
The path goes to like what seems to be an unusually thick clump of trees.

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:13.760
And in this thick clump of trees, you can see like maybe a man sized hole in the

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:14.760
trees.

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:15.760
Okay.

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:16.760
Which, which man?

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.760
Many different sizes.

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:19.760
Never mind.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:23.760
So, so that's in there is where the soul of growth is.

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:24.760
Yeah.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.760
You know that for sure.

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:26.760
Christopher.

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:27.760
Yeah.

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:28.760
Yeah.

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:29.760
Yeah.

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:30.760
I led you guys here.

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:31.760
I haven't led you astray yet.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:32.760
It's in there.

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:33.760
All right.

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.760
Christopher, why do you keep on signing all these trees and you're putting your autograph

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:37.760
on everything?

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:38.760
Done.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:39.760
I'm sorry.

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:40.760
No.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.760
Cause I'm practicing for my, you know, inevitable second hit.

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:43.760
That was a bad set up.

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:44.760
I'm sorry.

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:45.760
Pork.

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:50.760
Will you will them to foe into this hole and kind of like a platoon style?

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:51.760
Okay.

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.760
So I, I, I, I do my best will them to foe impression from platoon.

01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:57.760
And I go, see you in a week.

01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.760
And I, that's from platoon.

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:05.760
And I, and I, and I, and I, I, I, I turn a little, a little, one of those Vietnam

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:07.760
bendy flashlights that have a little red light.

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.760
And I jumped down the hole.

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:11.760
Well, do you want to look for Vietnam bendy flashlights?

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:14.760
Or Vietnam bendy flashlight on Amazon?

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:15.760
I've got one.

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:16.760
Okay.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:17.760
Yeah.

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:18.760
Do you want to light an actual torch?

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:19.760
Yes.

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:20.760
Okay.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:21.760
I light an actual torch.

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:22.760
Yeah.

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:27.760
Slipping through the, slipping through the hollow, you fall about 20 feet, landing

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:33.760
in about thick or three feet, thick feet, three feet of thick foul mud below the mud

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:34.760
is hard stone.

01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:36.760
And you can't see in the pitch black conditions.

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.260
Where's my torch?

01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:41.760
It just plunged into this thick mud and went out.

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:45.760
I walk over, light a torch, and I want to throw it to him.

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:46.760
That happens.

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:47.760
Okay.

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:50.760
You can see, you see a torch falling from above.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.760
Hey, torch!

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:52.760
Got it!

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:53.760
All right.

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:56.760
You grab the torch and hold it aloft.

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:57.760
Thanks, Christopher.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:58.760
Yep.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:06.260
The room is pretty narrow, but you can make out what seems to be a square in the far

01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:07.260
wall.

01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:12.600
Try not to fuck it.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:16.280
You know square peg, round hole, that kind of thing?

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:19.760
I should mention, I'm all fucked out from last week.

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:24.360
You also see several perfectly spherical fist size holes perforating the wall.

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:27.800
I fuck, I fuck one of those holes.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:36.840
The first one feels good, not the second one feels slightly bitey.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.720
It's too loose, man.

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.320
You're not that big.

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.320
You can fist it.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.320
I said fist size holes, man.

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:44.320
Okay.

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.240
I put my fist in the, I fist the hole?

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.240
I'm not suggesting that.

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:48.240
What am I, gross?

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:49.240
What is happening?

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:56.760
I, look, I see a hole shaped like a fist.

01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:59.360
I put my fist in the hole.

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.360
Okay.

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:01.360
Yeah.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.360
Fists in the hole, dude.

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:12.040
I, and then I, I, I rotate it 30 degrees to the right, then 40 degrees to the left.

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.040
I don't know.

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.040
I hear the far offset.

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.040
No, nothing happens.

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:16.040
Okay.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:19.960
I take my fist out of the hole.

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:20.960
Okay.

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:21.960
Hey guys, come on then.

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:24.000
There's a bunch of fist holes down here.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.480
I think you might have rope.

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:26.480
Yeah.

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.480
I mean, I have a rope guys.

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:28.480
Yeah.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:29.480
We can use it to climb down.

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.480
Yeah.

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.480
You want to climb down?

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:32.480
Yeah.

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.480
Yeah.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.480
You want to climb into the darkness below.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.880
You meet with Quark in the mud.

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:38.840
I use my staff, that staff with the button on it.

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:41.000
Using that staff with the button on it.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.320
You climb into the hole where the people are.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.320
Hey guys.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.320
I.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.320
Did you use the staff with the button on it?

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:48.320
Yeah.

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:49.320
Yeah.

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:51.320
I press the button on stick it, you know.

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.040
That's the trick.

01:26:53.040 --> 01:27:02.440
I, I use, I take one of my sacs and I, I throw it at the bottom of the hole.

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.440
And then I jump on the sack.

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.440
Like a landing pad.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.440
Okay.

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.840
Oh, is it, is the dirt an issue here?

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:08.840
I had rope.

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:09.840
You could climb down.

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:10.840
Oh, okay.

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:11.840
And I a pole.

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:12.840
Can I use, can I use Chris's rope?

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:13.840
Oh, thank you so much.

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:14.840
Yeah.

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:15.840
Of course.

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:16.840
Thank you.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:17.840
Thank you.

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:18.840
Thank you.

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:19.840
Thank you.

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:20.840
The rope, the ropes for everyone.

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:21.840
Yeah.

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:25.000
Also, there's free feed of mud down here.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000
I landed pretty softly.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.240
You can just kind of, you can kind of, kind of just hop on in here.

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:34.240
Like, I mean, I have rope, I will happily use your rope.

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.440
Guys, I examine the, the square at the, at the end of the thing.

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.880
It appears to be some sort of wooden board.

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:43.080
It's caked with mud and is stuck fast to the wall.

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.000
I detect magic on it.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
It is non-magic.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Oh, this isn't magic.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.800
Uh, does anybody have any thief, thiefy, like, detect traps?

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:54.800
Detect traps.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.000
Should I do detect traps?

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.480
I mean, you can, you can look for traps totally.

01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:59.880
All right.

01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:04.000
I look for traps totally.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Looking for traps.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.440
You fail to find anything.

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:09.800
Those holes are kind of suspicious, but you don't think they're traps.

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:10.800
How many holes are there?

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:11.800
There's, there's several.

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:18.240
I mean, there's, you will, you, if you counted them, you think it would be a waste of time.

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:24.600
I count the holes.

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.920
Never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight.

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:29.520
There are 76 holes.

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.520
Guys.

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:31.520
76?

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:35.200
Fist holes led the big.

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.040
I think a bunch of people just came down here.

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:41.400
I think the first guy saw the wooden board, detected traps and magic on it and nothing

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.160
happened and he was like, fuck, what do I do?

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:46.520
And he punched and then, and then whatever happened to him happened and then the next

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.320
guy came down and said, why is there a fist size hole?

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.320
It's got to be significant.

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:52.160
And then he punched like a bunch and then that kept happening.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:57.200
76 guys.

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.640
So I kick, I kick the wooden square.

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:01.600
I kick it.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:04.040
What's your strength?

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:10.160
Two million, nine, minus one ability modifier.

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:11.160
Yeah.

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:14.160
Nine is a negative modifier, kicking the board.

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:16.800
You feel it give a little bit, but it doesn't budge.

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.160
I kick it too.

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:20.160
What's your strength?

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:23.320
I'm 18 with a plus four ability modifier.

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:25.000
You kick it too.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.760
It bends it a bit better, but not much shit.

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:30.120
Can I call down a Coco?

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.120
She is a horse.

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.120
Oh yeah.

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:35.120
Can I fortify the wood?

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.960
What are you going to do?

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.960
We're trying to break it.

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:38.960
Yeah.

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:39.960
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.960
Well, I don't think Coco can fit down here.

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:45.640
I summon, really, she can't get it because she kicks so hard.

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:46.640
Okay.

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:47.640
Yeah.

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:48.640
Tell me about it.

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:49.640
Fine.

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:50.640
She liked it.

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:51.640
It's fine.

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:58.600
She was trying to kick you off.

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.160
That's nothing to be proud of.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.560
I like it.

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:02.560
I like it.

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:03.560
I like it.

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:04.560
I like it and I'm empowered.

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:05.560
It's fine.

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:06.560
I have a pretty high strength thing.

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.560
I have 13 plus one.

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:08.560
Okay.

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.120
Do you want to try and also kick it?

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.960
Do I have some sort of battering ram?

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:13.960
I mean, you don't.

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:14.960
You have.

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:15.960
Let's see.

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:16.960
I have an open lock thing.

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:19.800
Can I, is there a, is it a lock of some sort?

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.000
You could look for a lock.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.040
If you fail to see a lock, it just appears to be like sealed with some sort of wax or

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:29.680
maybe glue to this wall.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:33.880
I listened very carefully to the, to the wood, like I put my ear to it.

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:35.480
I can disable device.

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:36.480
Yeah.

01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:37.480
Oh, go first.

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:38.480
Go ahead.

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:43.400
You hear the faint sounds of hissing coming from some other floor far off.

01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.400
Snakes.

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.520
Why did it have to be snakes?

01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:50.720
Spencer has no idea.

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:53.880
You know, I saw, I saw the first, the first Indiana Jones.

01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:54.880
Oh, what'd you think?

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:55.880
It was good.

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:58.240
It was good.

01:30:58.240 --> 01:30:59.240
It wasn't like original.

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:02.480
And I mean, it was, but it wasn't that original.

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:07.560
After seeing all of television, biting it off for like years, like you've seen literally

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:10.120
every element represented in other things.

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:11.120
That's like easy.

01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:12.120
That's what I watch.

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:13.120
Easy Rider.

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:14.120
I'm like, what the fuck is this?

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:15.120
Yeah.

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:16.120
Are they awesome?

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.920
But it was like, it was like, it was, it was seeing all of it like throughout time.

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:19.920
I don't know.

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:20.920
It was good.

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:24.840
You know, you saw the movie, where I live.

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:28.320
What did you think of my hosting when you were watching the movie?

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.160
Did you like it when you was my hosting good?

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.160
It was great.

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:33.160
Can I?

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.160
I really loved the party, Aaron.

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:35.160
That didn't sound good either.

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:36.160
I don't know how to.

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:37.160
No, never.

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:38.160
You know what?

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:39.160
Spencer, just throw it away.

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.160
Just putting too much into it.

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:41.160
I really like the party.

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.160
Wait, what?

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.160
Oh.

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:44.160
Just throw it away.

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:45.160
You're thinking about it too much.

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:50.160
I had a party.

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.160
No.

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.160
I actually tried.

01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:53.160
Can I?

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:54.160
This is not going to work.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.160
I'll kick it.

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:56.160
Fine.

01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:58.660
I think we're doing two different bits.

01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:01.760
I kick it also, and I have 13 plus one strength.

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:02.760
Okay.

01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:03.760
Sorry.

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:04.760
I forgot everything.

01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:05.760
We're just kicking a wooden thing right now.

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:06.760
You kick it.

01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:07.760
You see it splinter.

01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:08.760
That's what Coco said about that.

01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:09.760
You think it's almost broken.

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:10.760
Guys, it's almost broken.

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:14.760
By the way, I heard hissing on the other side of it.

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:15.760
Shit.

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:26.760
I use a rapid fire shot, and I shoot two arrows at the burning hands.

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:30.760
My mom's here.

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:33.160
He's broken hearted over wanting you to use something.

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:34.160
I used two arrows.

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.760
I shoot them at either side of the frame.

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:39.760
They strike the board and plant fast in the board.

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.760
I think you just made the board stronger.

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:42.760
Yeah.

01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:43.760
Sorry.

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.760
I got yelled at by burning hands.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.760
Can I cast burning hands on the board?

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:53.760
Casting burning hands on the board is consumed in flames.

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.760
You see a hole about three feet in diameter.

01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:59.760
It looks like it goes some distance.

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.760
Does my light spell have a range to it?

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:03.760
Can I cast a light?

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:07.760
You cast it on an object, and it'll make it glow like a torch.

01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:12.760
I take one of my arrows, put a light on it, and I'll shoot it.

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:13.760
Nicely done.

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:16.760
You have arrows.

01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:23.760
Yeah, I mean, I have arrows, I have a hit song, I've got a couple.

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:28.760
The hit song sort of arrowed to the top of the charts back in the day.

01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:32.760
I cast light on the tip of one of Christopher's arrows.

01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:35.760
And I then, in turn, shoot that arrow.

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:36.760
Through the hole, right?

01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:38.760
Through the hole, yeah.

01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:42.760
Behind him, I like mime it.

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:43.760
Very sadly.

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:47.760
That was me that did it, not her.

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:50.760
But I mean, through my mime encouragement.

01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:51.760
Yeah, awesome.

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:57.760
I watched this all happen and do a camera take and go.

01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:02.760
And then Coco looks at him and takes her a hoe and goes...

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.760
I fuck Coco again.

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:06.760
No, you're in the hole.

01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:08.760
Coco's up there.

01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.760
I climb the rope and fuck Coco.

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:12.760
No, I took the rope down, it's my rope.

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:15.760
I take your Sharpie staff and I climb the staff.

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.760
He's just jangling for the rope.

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:21.760
Sanctuary!

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:24.760
I shit on the ground for no reason.

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:27.760
Hey, how about the lighted arrow that I shot?

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.760
Firing the lighted arrow through the hole.

01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:30.760
Let's focus.

01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:32.760
Yeah, but me fucking Coco's a B story.

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:33.760
Let's get back to the A story.

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:36.760
For a brief moment, you can see the floor being lit up.

01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:39.760
There seems to be a mosaic scrawled across the floor.

01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:42.760
It's big and green, but you're not sure what it's representing.

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:46.760
Because it glows and you're shooting it and it plants in the wall.

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:50.760
So it plants in the far wall and you can see what appears to be a wooden door.

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.760
As well as a stone lever jetting out of the wall.

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:55.760
Do we see any snakes?

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.760
You don't see any snakes.

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.760
I pull the stone lever.

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:03.760
You are in a different room.

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.760
We gotta walk in.

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:10.760
As a gnome, am I small enough to squeeze through that small hole?

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:11.760
I think all of us can.

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:14.760
You can all go through, but not at the same time.

01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:16.760
But Chris de Burgh has the power to detect traps.

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:17.760
Yeah.

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:18.760
I'll go in.

01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:20.760
Not in a 4-chan sense.

01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:23.760
I go in.

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:29.760
I go in and I detect traps.

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.760
That was a low roll, wasn't it?

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:35.760
You rolled an 18, so that's pretty good.

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:36.760
I don't know.

01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:39.760
Do you see, you should have a search check.

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:41.760
Do you have on the skills?

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:42.760
Is there a number there?

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:43.760
Yeah, 9.

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:44.760
Awesome.

01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:45.760
10.

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:46.760
It's 9.

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:48.760
It's still pretty good.

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:52.760
Surveying the landscape, you see a few oddities.

01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:55.760
There's some scrape marks on the walls.

01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:00.760
You can see a few cracks in the ruins where roots poke out of the walls,

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.760
but they seem to be cut off.

01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.760
It definitely seems like there might be some trap about,

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:06.760
but you can't determine its true nature.

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:09.760
Guys, I'm getting a weird vibe here.

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.760
There's vines that are out of the walls.

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:15.760
Somebody did cut the vines, but it seemed like they were attack vines.

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:18.760
Look where the vines are cut and see if there's openings.

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:22.760
That penitent man will kneel from Indiana Judge 3.

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:26.760
Are they cut because something comes out of the walls?

01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:29.760
I'm just saying.

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:33.760
You can just see only the very bits of them come out of the walls.

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:37.760
Almost as soon as they come out of the walls, that's where they're shorn off.

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:39.760
Right, so something comes through here like a dick of a...

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.760
I have a trap sense too.

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:43.760
Can I add onto that?

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:45.760
You can search for trap.

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:46.760
I search for traps.

01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.760
You don't find a new trap?

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:49.760
Shit.

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:52.760
Why don't you go fuck a horse?

01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:56.760
You know what? I don't mind if I do.

01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:59.760
Alright, let me see if I have a spell.

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.760
Everybody back up out of here.

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:06.760
I think I have a spell that I can pull that lever from a remote distance.

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:10.760
And if I'm wrong about that, then I will have wasted your time.

01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:13.760
So Chris, do you have a lot of arrows?

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:16.760
Yeah, I mean I got mage hand, right?

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:19.760
Okay, everybody back up, back up.

01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:22.760
If you have to take a shit, go take a shit, smoke them if you got them.

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:26.760
Alright, everybody get out of the line of fire of this hole.

01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:32.760
I'm going to cast mage hand on the lever from safely outside the entrance to that whole tunnel.

01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:34.760
And pull that lever.

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:35.760
You pull the lever.

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:40.760
At first nothing happens, but then you see movement on the wooden door far down the hall.

01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:44.760
It rumbles and then falls forward.

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:50.760
It hits the ground and shatters part of the mosaic, causing a few cracks to run down its length.

01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:55.760
You see behind the wall there is no doorway, but instead just a dead end.

01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:58.760
That's confusing.

01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:02.760
This lever was a decoy lever, I think.

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.760
We're back in puzzle world.

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:07.760
Yeah, we're running a lot.

01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:10.760
Can we examine the mosaic before we do it?

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.760
Yeah, we look at the mosaic.

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:15.760
At this point, only kumels in this room.

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:19.760
Oh, fuck, you didn't wait for me to leave until you pulled the lever.

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.760
I said everybody get back, everybody get back.

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:22.760
Why didn't you hear you?

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:26.760
Okay, so wait, you are now back in the room that you guys are in?

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:33.760
Yeah, when he was like, everyone get back, I went back into the main standard room.

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:35.760
I can go back in and look at the mosaic.

01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:37.760
Okay, so now you want to go back in and look at the mosaic?

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.760
Yeah, I just want to see what the...

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:44.760
It's like there's a giant green serpentine, like perhaps a dragon.

01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.760
Definitely a dragon, I take that back.

01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:49.760
Guys, it's definitely a dragon.

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:50.760
What?

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:55.760
At first I thought it was like a snake kind of thing, but it's definitely a dragon.

01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:01.760
Its mouth is open wide in aggression, and you can see its mouth is just an entire slab of ruby crystal.

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:04.760
Quirk should fuck it.

01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:08.760
There's a ruby crystal, can I remove the ruby crystal?

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:09.760
Do you want to?

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:14.760
At this point you're still like near these guys, right?

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.760
I think we're running along.

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.760
We should come to a cliffhanger here.

01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.760
Well, let's let this play out.

01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:22.760
We came out at 8, 10.

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:28.760
It's 10 now, that means we've put these people through worse.

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:29.760
What are they going to do?

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:30.760
Complain?

01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:31.760
I can't...

01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:34.760
Yeah, that is exactly what they could do.

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:35.760
Here, I'll fix it.

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:38.760
Ladies and gentlemen, Eric Eidl's here.

01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:39.760
No, he's not.

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:40.760
He's not.

01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:43.760
Sorry, I thought that would bolster them for a second.

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:50.760
That would be really funny if Eric Eidl did come out then, and he was just sitting on it like, we're going to go really long.

01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.760
But he's been here every week.

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:53.760
Yeah.

01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:56.760
He just comes with me every right now.

01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:58.760
He's the new me.

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:01.760
He comes up to me when I'm like three in the morning, I'm at Del Taco, and they're like,

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:05.760
sir, could you please make up your mind, I'm like, you know what, Eric Eidl's here, and he comes up.

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:06.760
Hello?

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:07.760
The guy's like, I don't.

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:08.760
Dan wants a taco.

01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:09.760
Dan wants a taco.

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:14.760
Dan wants a taco now.

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:18.760
That was omaji and mocking at the same time.

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:21.760
So can I remove, should I try and remove the ruby?

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:22.760
Do it, Christopher.

01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:23.760
Remove it.

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:24.760
Oh, it's a red ruby.

01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:27.760
This is my specialty.

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:29.760
Ruby in red.

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:31.760
Who's that?

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:33.760
Grabbing at the ruby.

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.760
You pry with all your might.

01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:40.760
At the second you begin prying, you hear a rumbling sound behind you.

01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:42.760
Guys.

01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:44.760
Guys.

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:46.760
You're the only one in the room at this point.

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:51.760
Guys!

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:57.760
Turning around behind you, you see that a large stone wall is rumbled down, blocking your exit.

01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.760
Oh.

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:03.760
At the same time, you feel the giant ruby you've been grabbing.

01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:07.760
Move and jiggle a little bit, as if it's trying to pull itself free.

01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:11.760
As if it's trying to pull itself free from my hands, or it's from the thing it says?

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:12.760
From what you're doing.

01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.760
I spoke dumb.

01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:16.760
So it's trying to regain...

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:20.760
You're making progress, pulling the ruby out of the thing, but it's not out yet.

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:23.760
I dived through into the room with him.

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:25.760
No, it's blocked.

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.760
I was slashing with my sword in a barbarian rage.

01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:29.760
I tried to make it through to the room with Christopher.

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:32.760
Okay, so you strike the rock surface with your sword.

01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.760
Yes.

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:37.760
Feels useless.

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:39.760
I'm like, I'm digging through.

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.760
I'm trying to get my... I tunnel with my sword.

01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.760
You make the lightest of scratches.

01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:47.760
If I cast knock on it, does knock work on this kind of thing?

01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:49.760
Knock wouldn't work on this. It's far too heavy.

01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:51.760
Knock wouldn't work on you.

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:53.760
It's not openable.

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.760
So...

01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:58.760
Slowly, the wall starts rumbling towards you.

01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.760
Threatening to crush you against the far...

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:04.760
Christopher, get out of there, you son of a bitch!

01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:06.760
Can they hear me?

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:09.760
Um, sure.

01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:12.760
Guys, these are my last words.

01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:15.760
Lady Enra!

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:19.760
Cliffhanger!

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:21.760
Alright, okay.

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:24.760
Oh, no.

01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:27.760
Okay.

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:30.760
Thank you, Aaron.

01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:32.760
Thank you, Camille, not Gianni.

01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:34.760
Thank you, Camille.

01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:36.760
Erin McGathy.

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.760
And Spencer.

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:47.760
That's a cliffhanger, because now Christopher is just trapped in a crumbling room,

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.760
and we're helpless to save him.

01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:55.760
It's crazy. I mean, Joseph Campbell would be very proud of us, I think.

01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:57.760
What stage would that be in a story, you think?

01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.760
I don't know, the belly of the thingamabob.

01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:02.760
What you doing there?

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.760
I'm just trying to get tangle-free.

01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:06.760
Alright, then.

01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:12.760
Let's bring this ship into the station and talk about what we learned.

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:15.760
What did you learn?

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.760
I don't know.

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:20.760
Go with the flow? That's kind of easy to learn.

01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:24.760
I learn that every week, by having a show that pays nothing,

01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:27.760
and that I don't care if it goes good or bad.

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:32.760
I think the lesson just kind of continues.

01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:36.760
Like DC Pearson said, this is the reason movies don't continue past the end.

01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:39.760
As a hero, I'm kind of done.

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:42.760
I like these guys coming here.

01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:47.760
If you were really courageous, you would just gently put the mic back in the stand

01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:53.760
and walk off the stage, and allow that to be the end of the show.

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:56.760
I don't know.

01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:12.760
But let me ask you one thing.

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:15.760
No, no, that's the part.

01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:19.760
You were supposed to just say, the master walks away,

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:24.760
and you should just walk away and leave these people with the confidence

01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:29.760
of knowing that you've done your job.

01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:35.760
What were you going to ask them?

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:38.760
What if it feels awkward?

01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:44.760
It'll feel awkward if you let them know it's awkward.

01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:49.760
You know in the old days, the term break a leg comes from not from like actor's superstition,

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:53.760
it comes from make it to the end, because bowing, where you break your back leg,

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:56.760
like you kind of bend your leg, that means make it to the end.

01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:00.760
And it's lowering yourself to the audience and saying thank you for coming.

01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:03.760
So like if you just did a deep bow to the audience, saying thank you.

01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:07.760
I thought it came from John Wilkes Booth breaking his leg after shooting the president in the head.

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:11.760
No, he broke an ankle.

01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:19.760
That's like your leg.

01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:24.760
I mean the alternative is that you have to leave these people with some sort of special message.

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:27.760
It's difficult.

01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:30.760
It's lonely.

01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:33.760
You're all by yourself out there.

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:36.760
People pay $10.

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.760
Spencer drove from CME Valley to be here.

01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:45.760
There's a woman here from Estonia tonight.

01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:46.760
Is that true?

01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:55.760
No.

01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:00.760
In the beginning, there was nothing.

01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:05.760
Nothing had an eternity to decide that nothing was worse than something.

01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:08.760
Nothing split into a million somethings,

01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:10.760
AKA everything.

01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:13.760
You were part of that everything.

01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:23.760
So was the person next to you.

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:26.760
No matter who fires you,

01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:32.760
no matter whose laundry is left in your apartment complex is drier.

01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:35.760
Half dry.

01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:42.760
No matter who writes notes on your company's refrigerator's great coupon saying touch and die.

01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:50.760
And then writes notes on the door of the fridge saying everything in here after Friday will be thrown away.

01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:56.760
No matter how many recycling bins you can't tell from regular bins.

01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:01.760
No matter how many pains and your nuts and your kidney and your forehead and the back of your neck,

01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:06.760
no matter how much hair you see in your shower drain.

01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:16.760
No matter what you look like from the side in the mirror after you take a shit.

01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:22.760
No matter what some crazy lady said about you that came back to you after you went out with her for a week

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:28.760
and then you found out she said something weird about you because you ran into someone at Kmart.

01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:39.760
You are a citizen of Harmontown.

01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:41.760
You belong.

01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:44.760
You belong if you're human.

01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:50.760
You belong if you leave your isms and your itises at the door.

01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:59.760
I've never seen a sight that didn't look better looking back.

01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:04.760
Thank you for coming to Harmontown tonight.

01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:14.760
I've been Gaith, Ryan Ridley, Erin McGathy, Kumail Nanjiani, Spencer Crittenden.

01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:25.760
Again, I'm Jeff Davis and you may hear Dan Harmon, everyone.

01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:45.760
See Marvin, everybody, singing their songs. I knew closing.
