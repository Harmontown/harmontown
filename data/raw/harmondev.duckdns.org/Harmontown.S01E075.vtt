games\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nI hate them now more than ever\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nAnd I hate games\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nI hate sports and games\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nAnything where there's a winner or a loser\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nI absolutely hate\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nThis is just a thing you're making me do\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nGoing on in the background\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:14.000\nYeah, this is in the background\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.000\nIt's a game\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:18.000\nThe person who gets it\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nDon't like it, never like games\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nIf you guess before\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nI hate games\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:26.000\nIf you guess before it's 9-11\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nThen you're disqualified\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nClosest person after\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nIt's a game\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nLet's continue\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nAnd if you guess after\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:35.000\nYou lose\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:36.000\nThe quickest\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:37.000\nThe terrorist win\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:38.000\nWhatever\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nGames, I hate them\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nI hate that game, The War on Terror\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:45.000\nThere's a winner or a loser\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nI do not like it\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nSo you don't want us to fight\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:50.000\nThe War on Terror\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nI don't want anybody to win or lose\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nI just want us to all have a good time\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nAnd smoke a jay, man\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nWe'll just sit back\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:01.000\nAnd watch some fucking afternoon television\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nAnd just smoke a jay\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nWhy don't we all smoke jays\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:08.000\nThen we wouldn't be bombing so many people\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nYeah, hey man\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nIf the government would just smoke a jay\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nIt wouldn't be shut down, right?\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:17.000\nHow many days would you say you smoke daily?\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:18.000\nHow many jays?\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:19.000\nHow many jays?\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:23.000\nMan, I smoke a whole alphabet of jays\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:24.000\nSo one\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:25.000\nSo one jay\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nSo one jay\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:32.000\nSo a whole alphabet worth of jays\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:33.000\nMaybe, okay\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nMaybe an alphabet and a half\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.000\nOkay, if you stop after jay\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:41.000\nI had a murder mystery birthday party\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:44.000\nHate games\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:46.000\nI hated that game too, but it's over with\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nYes, well I had a murder mystery birthday party\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:50.000\nAnd Rob was like, is it okay if I come a little late?\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nI'm working\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:54.000\nAnd he came just a little too late\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nAnd got murdered immediately upon entering\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nLike didn't have to play\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:58.000\nAnd you know why?\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.000\nThe whole time I'm like going\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\nAnd I'm going to Harmon\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nI said, I'm gonna show up\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nThat's why I fucking hate games\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nIs because I always\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nWhether you're playing Werewolf\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:10.000\nOr Scrabble\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:11.000\nOr Sorry\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nOr 9-Eleven Game\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nOr whatever\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.000\nIt's like\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nAlright, I'm gonna do it\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:18.000\nAnd then\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nIt's like out of the gate\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:21.000\nOkay, the first one to get\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nWhether it's paintball or whatever\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nIt's just like the first person to die\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nAnd sit in the corner and watch everybody\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nHave a good time as me\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nAlright, well speaking of games\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:33.000\nI have a game\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:34.000\nJesus!\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nRobin, I came over here together\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nAnd I was\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nI came with the cure, apparently\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nHe jumped in the car and he was like\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:46.000\nAh, this outfit\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:47.000\nAnd I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.000\nAnd then it wasn't until I looked in the mirror\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:50.000\nAnd the bathroom here\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nI was like, oh my god, I look\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:53.000\nLike shit\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:54.000\nI look terrible\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:55.000\nAlright\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nI made up my mind\n\n14:58.000 --> 14:59.000\nThat we were gonna play D&D\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nFor a really long time tonight\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nBut even if we don't do that\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nI at least want to get Spencer up here earlier than usual\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nLet's bring up Spencer\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nHere's another thing\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:14.000\nWelcome, welcome, Spencer\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nHere's another thing I noticed\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:17.000\nBecause I, of course\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nWhat's happening?\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:20.000\nWait a minute, what?\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:21.000\nReally quick\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nWas that my playoff music?\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nNo, I\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nI was talking to\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nI accidentally updated my iPod\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nAnd my only playlist is\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nYou have a giant iPod?\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nNo, it's just breaking bad music\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nAnd TLC right now\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nTLC, like left eye?\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:39.000\nYeah\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:43.000\nLike, what's a natural phenomenon\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nYou shouldn't go after\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nWaterfalls?\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:50.000\nYeah\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:51.000\nIs that right?\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:52.000\nYeah, that's right\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nAre we playing a game right now?\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nBecause I would pitch about it\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nI do have a\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nBecause it is Jeff's 40th birthday\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nI do have a Jeff\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nA Jeff game for the three of you to play\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:07.000\nAlright\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nOh, shit\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:13.000\nIs it like a five minute game or like\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nI don't know, 90 minutes\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nWe don't have to play it if you don't want to\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nIs it like questions about Jeff?\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:22.000\nNo\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nYeah, that would be weird\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:26.000\nAre you going to\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:29.000\nIt would be like a three-way newlywed game\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nLet me see if Spencer's a conversational goldmine\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nBefore we go into this game\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:36.000\nI'd like to think so\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nSpencer, I just heard about your parents' divorce\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:39.000\nI'm sorry\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nYeah, whatever\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nMaybe it's personal\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nHe announced it\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:47.000\nWell, I only heard about it\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nBecause I just listened to the last week's show\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nBefore the show\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:51.000\nI'm sorry\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nYeah, it was more a public concern\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nBecause it turns out it was Spencer's fault\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:56.000\nYeah\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nI really screwed the pooch\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nDid they try to abort you?\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:05.000\nYeah, and I've been turning them back ever since\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:09.000\nHow's your, uh, uh, uh...\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:10.000\nDice\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:11.000\nHow's your...\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nWell, let me tell you, Rob\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nThis dice, I don't know\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nHow's your job as my assistant going?\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nIt's so good, it's so great\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nIt's, uh, the only thing I don't like\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nIs that I feel like I'm worthless\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nAnd that I don't do my job right\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:26.000\nBecause it's so easy\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:27.000\nYeah, that's why\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nIt's because a lot of it's just sitting down\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nWhy don't you clean my car?\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nWhenever you find yourself feeling like that\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nJust go clean my car\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:39.000\nThis is the kind of dialogues that we need to have\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nThis is the kind of dialogue I need to not have\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nBecause it makes me feel like an elitist prick\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nTelling someone to clean his car\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nI need you to go,\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nShit, I got nothing to do\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nClean that motherfucker's car\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nThere's a lot of Baja Fresh\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nWrappers in the back\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nI should probably take care of those\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:59.000\nMy car gets really messy too\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\nI don't think about it\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nBecause I don't think about cleaning my car\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nRob, what were you doing an impression of?\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:06.000\nOf me\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:07.000\nThat was Spencer\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:08.000\nYeah\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nOh, check out all the Baja Fresh\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:13.000\nWrappers in the back\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nI should probably take care of these\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:16.000\nAnd maybe get rid of them\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:18.000\nIs that like Thomas Hayden Church?\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nI'll have to get rid of these\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:22.000\nBaja Fresh Wrappers in the back\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nThere's stuff like\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nTwo shoeboxes deep back\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nIt's like, how is anybody supposed to sit back here?\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nHey, can I ask you guys a question?\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nSure, ask Spencer\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nIt's about poop\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nIs this about hot snakes?\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nIs that what you call poop?\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:46.000\nI just learned about something called hot snakes today\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:50.000\nIt's apparently, it's a shape of poop, I guess\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nI thought I might be lactose intolerant\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nAnd I brought it up to my friend Nolan\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nAnd he's like, you got hot snakes?\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nAnd I'm like, what is, what?\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nAnd he's like, you must not be\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nAnd I'm like, that doesn't mean any, you just said things\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nAnd then diagnosed me\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nI don't know\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nChristopher Nolan?\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nNo, Nolan fabricated\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nNolan, stand up\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nWhat's up?\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nNolan is wearing a\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nA jean jacket\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nAnd some table glasses\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nWhat's a hot snake?\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:22.000\nIt's just the kind of poop you get\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nIf you drink milk with weak stomach acid\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nIt's like hot, it's hotter than redwood poop\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nAnd it's real\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nI brought it up, I held it\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:32.000\nAlright, Nolan, get on the mic\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nCome on down there\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nBut isn't all, aren't all\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nPoop snakes\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nAnd aren't they all hot?\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nNot because of\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nHey man, you haven't seen mine\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nThis is why it's hard to explain\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nIt's like, it's condescending, it's like\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nIf you've been there, you know\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nNo, snakes resonate\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nWith anyone, please\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nDefining poop is never condescending\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nBill, are you serious?\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.000\nDude, thanks man\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:04.000\nIt's important to note that\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nNolan is holding a bottle\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nOf alcohol\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nYeah, also\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nAlso the Canadian tuxedo\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nWhat?\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nDouble denims\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:18.000\nSo Dan, what is your poop question?\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nOkay, well I don't know if I want Nolan up here\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:22.000\nWhen I do it\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:24.000\nAlright Nolan, go sit down\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nThank you Nolan, hot snakes\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nHot snakes\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nHe seems like a good young man\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nYou seem like you're rolling\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nWith a good crowd\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nSelling like hot snakes\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nWait, really quick\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nNolan, is that\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nYour own term\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:44.000\nOr is that a common expression\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nHot snakes\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nMe and my friends from where I'm from\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nJust understood what it meant\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nAlright Dan's poop question\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nMine doesn't have to do with\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nThe actual content\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nIt has to do with scheduling\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nI've got an answer for this\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nFor as long as I can remember\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nAnd this is not something\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.000\nI'm complaining about at all\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:10.000\nI think this might be a superpower\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nThat I have\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nEvery time that I eat\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:18.000\nI poop\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nThat's good\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nThat's great\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nI know it's not the food\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nThat I just ate\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nBecause that's ridiculous\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nBut it always seems like that\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nI have an English muffin\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nNo, God no\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:38.000\nNot a half hour later\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:40.000\nYou're saying you're eating\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nYou're not saying the obvious thing\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nThat everything you eat you poop out\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\nYou're saying\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nThat's the cartoon illusion that happens\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nBecause of what's happening\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nI just have perfect synchronization\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nI'm always filled with food\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nAnd then I put one\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nLike meal\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nIn my mouth\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:02.000\nYou're chewing your mouths\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:04.000\nIt's psychological\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.000\nEvery time\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.000\nYour tongue tastes\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:10.000\nLike sugar and salt\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nIt's like time to get it going\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.000\nAre you using the editorial you\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:16.000\nOr are you telling me how my\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\nYou Dan Harmon\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nMe personally?\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nOther people are accused by\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:30.000\nMorey's on\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\nI don't really like\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nTalking about my bathroom business\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nBut\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nYou like to let it do\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nIt's talking for you\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nI mean before I have\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nA big thing happening\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nShit coming out of your ass\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nWhen I started doing improv\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nI got really\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:52.000\nSuperstitious about\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nPooping before a show\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nBecause I would get nervous\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nAnd then have a great show\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nWhether those two things\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nAre related\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nIt's just like\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nPsychological\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nI think it's perfect to poop right as you eat\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nI've always wanted to do that\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nIt's like clockwork\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:14.000\nYou got garbage in, garbage out\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nIt's on the cycle\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:18.000\nIt's synchronized\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nI honestly wanted to do that\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nTotally, totally\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:24.000\nDo you have any tips?\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nI think I've just\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nWondered into some kind of perfect\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:30.000\nI just don't want to screw it up\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nSpencer, what's your poop cue?\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.000\nIn the morning it sucks because\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.000\nI have to go pee in the morning\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nThat happens to people\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nBut I always have to\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nGo pee and then go poop\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nBut I only have to go poop like 50 minutes\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nAfter I go pee and it's like in the morning\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nSo I got to get up to go to the bathroom twice\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nAnd that just kills any chance I have\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nOf getting back to sleep in the morning\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nJust resist it?\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nNope\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nSomebody asked me\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nA couple of weeks ago\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:02.000\nWhat's some advice on directing\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:04.000\nAnd I said\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:06.000\nDo a shot list whether you need it or not\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nYour crew thinks you're working\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.000\nAlways\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nTalk to your actors\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nAnd the most important thing\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nTake a shit\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:20.000\nBefore you leave\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.000\nThe house in the morning\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:24.000\nBecause shitting on set is like\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nThe most disgusting thing in the world\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nIt's terrible\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nSo every morning before I go on set\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\nLike I'll\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\nI won't force myself to take a shit\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nBecause that sounds like it\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nBut I mean my brain is\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\nLike\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:42.000\nYou gotta take a shit now\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nIs needing to be on set\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nYeah, there is a definite like\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nScare if I for some reason\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nMiss it like I get up super early\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nAnd I forget to shit like I'm driving\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nI'll be panicking\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:56.000\nBecause if I\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nI have a love-hate relationship\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nWith my ass\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nI've talked about this before\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nOn the show\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nAnd if I go to\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:08.000\nNumber two\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nI need to be clean\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nThe rest of the day\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nSo I'll jump in the shower usually\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nTo clean it off\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nYou can't do that when you're on set\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nHe's obsessive about his butt\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nYeah\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nWhy did it get all real quiet\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:26.000\nIn here\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nIs everybody leaning in\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nOr leaning back\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nI don't understand\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:34.000\nI've known about your anal obsession\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:36.000\nFor a while\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nIt's not an anal obsession\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:40.000\nI like to be clean\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nBut my question is like\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nWhen you clean yourself in the shower\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:46.000\nAnd I've thought this before\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:48.000\nAnd I've never had the gumption to ask you\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nDo you bend over\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nLike the copper tone girl\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:54.000\nOr what do you do\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:56.000\nNo, no, no, no, no\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nAt one point I had the snake\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:00.000\nThe hot snake?\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nIs that what you meant?\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nI had the shower snake\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\nAnd that got unhealthy\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:08.000\nAnd you went to the doctor\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:10.000\nAnd the doctor was like\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:12.000\nWhat the fuck did you do to your ass\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:14.000\nAnd I was like\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:16.000\nI was like\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nI'll call you about it\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nBut you were flattered that he noticed\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nWhat do you mean\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.000\nThis whole thing\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nI just threw this together\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.000\nNo big deal\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nWhen I was 10 years old\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nMy family went camping in Alabama\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:36.000\nAnd when you go\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nIt was a campground where there was a shower\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nThat was like a communal shower\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nAnd I was 9 or 10 years old\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nAnd I went\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:46.000\nAnd I was taking a shower by myself\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nGood\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\nI was taking a shower by myself\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nGranted, my uncle was there\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\nAnd I was asked to pretend like I was surfing\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:58.000\nBut I was mostly by myself\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nThank you\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:04.000\nIt was a reference to\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:06.000\nA smart guy\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:08.000\nTo the sitcom Smart Guy\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nWhere there was a pedophile episode\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\nAnd he asked a kid to take his shirt off\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.000\nAnd pretend like he was surfing\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:16.000\nThere was a different strokes pedophile episode\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.000\nWhen I was your age\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\nAnd it was Gordon Jump from WKRP\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nWas the pedophile\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nAnd he took Dudley and Arnold into the bathroom\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:32.000\nAnd they played Poseidon\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:34.000\nNeptune\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:36.000\nThe Kurt Russell one\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:38.000\nKurt Russell\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\nNo, it was Gordon Jump\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\nI mean Poseidon\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\nOh Jesus, curious you guys\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:46.000\nI mean all I wanted to do was play D&D\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nSo you went camping, I can't believe you're telling this story\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nThis is amazing\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:54.000\nI went camping\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nAnd I was in the shower\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.000\nI was there by myself\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\nAnd I had to poop very badly\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:02.000\nAnd there was a drain there\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:04.000\nAnd you know when you're a kid, maybe I was younger than 10\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nNope, no, it was certainly 10\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nAnd I saw the drain there\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nI had to poop very badly\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:14.000\nAnd I just didn't understand the physics of poop and a drain\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.000\nAnd so I squatted down and pooped on the drain\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:18.000\nAnd there was like a solid\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nPoop\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nLike a solid log on top of the drain\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:24.000\nLike a cold snake\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:28.000\nYou were hoping for a bunch of baby snakes\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nTo come out and...\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nI just thought it would wash away the same way that he did\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.000\nIn an ocean\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:38.000\nBut I pooped in the drain\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:40.000\nAnd I finished my shower and wouldn't go away\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:42.000\nAnd I was just like, I'll leave it there\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:44.000\nIt's fine\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nI went back to join my family\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nAnd a couple hours later\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nMy mom and I are\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nDoing something, we're making dinner\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nAnd she goes to the bathroom, she comes back\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nDisgusted\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nAnd it's like, some animal\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nSome monster\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nWent and defecated\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nMy mother was very waspy\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nDefecated in the shower\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nAnd didn't clean up after themselves\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nWhat animal?\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nWas going on and on about\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:14.000\nI don't know where they were raised\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nAnd where their values are\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nMcGathey's\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nWe would never\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nWe would never\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nAnd I'm just sitting there like, baking or doing\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nNot baking, on a cave site\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nI'm sitting there fixing the television\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nI'm doing something\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:36.000\nAnd I'm just listening to her go on and on\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nAbout how our family is better than other families\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nBecause\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nThe guilt, just this weight\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nAnd when she was done, I was like, mom\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nI was\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nMe, I pooped\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nI pooped in the shower\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nI couldn't hold it\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nWhen you're young, you don't\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nThat's actually a very interesting\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nReflex to that, yeah\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nYou don't understand how things\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nYou don't understand physics\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nBecause in your mind\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nYou have a cartoon of it going\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nI pooped my pants when I was a kid\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nAnd I just took my underwear\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\nI knew I wasn't supposed to do it\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nI took my dirty underwear\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nAnd I opened the window to my bedroom\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nAnd I just threw them out\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:20.000\nBecause I thought that outside\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nWas like the garbage\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nAnd I thought the garbage was magic\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nProbably\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nBecause you were walking around\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nAnd you were walking over from school\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nAnd you said, oh, there's a shoe there\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nThere's a piece of\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nThere's a sock there\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nAnd you go, well\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nMy mom eventually goes like\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nDid you poop your pants?\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nI'm like, no, absolutely not\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nIt's on her head, like a hat\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nShe was mowing the lawn\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nDid you poop your pants?\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nShe's holding a pair of hedge trimmers\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nAnd a grimace\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nAnd I put my ears like\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:00.000\nI'm Alec Baldwin in the hearing\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nIn Malice, you know, I'm all cocky about it\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nNo, I did not poop\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nGod complex\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nI'm God\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:10.000\nA year later\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nI was walking home from soccer practice\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nAnd I had like accidentally peed my pants before\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:16.000\nJust like every kid does\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nAnd I was\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:20.000\n11 or 12\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:22.000\nToo old, walking home from soccer practice\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nWalking with my neighbor\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nAnd like I had to pee really badly\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nAnd I was just wearing soccer shorts and a soccer jersey\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nAnd because like from experience\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nLike, oh, if I pee a little on my pants\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nNo one really knows\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nAnd I had to pee so bad\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nI was like, I'll just let it go\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nAnd I just peed all over my shoes\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nYou did a gesture\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nFor the podcast\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nErin just did a gesture from her shoulder\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nYeah\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nI peed out of my neck\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nYou guys peed out of your neck\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nLike she's an Aunt Jemima bottle full of pee\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nWow\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:58.000\nI just emptied myself\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:00.000\nThat's a healthy pee\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nFrom the top of my spout toe\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nAnd a strong sweatshirt\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nBut just with my\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nAnd I know that my friend and my neighbor noticed\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nBut just like had the\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:12.000\nLike allowed\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:14.000\nAllow me to stay face enough to not mention it\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:16.000\nBut I peed all over my shorts\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\nAnd on the ground there's a trail\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:20.000\nThere's a river behind me and she was just like\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nSo are you watching Saved by the Bell later\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\nOr like what's going on\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.000\nLike just walking home with pee all over myself\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:28.000\nThen to that poop story is that my mom made me\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:30.000\nGo in and watch me clean it up\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\nWow\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.000\nRIP\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\nI mean that's a pretty strong family\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nI mean I'm very impressed by\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nBeing 10 years old\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nAnd\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nHaving all of that pressure\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:46.000\nActually to lie\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nThe path of least resistance\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:50.000\nThere and also like actually\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nYou knew you were going to really\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:54.000\nDisappoint your mom by telling her that\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nShe was making it extra apparent\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.000\nBut you wanted to tell her out of guilt\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nWhich is really interesting\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nMaybe your dad was a pastor\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nThere's a different force there\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nI know my parents\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nMy mom would say\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nDo I have to get out the Bible\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nI wouldn't\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nIt was a deal breaker for me\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nNo matter how fucking cold to rights\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:18.000\nI had my alibi\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nShe had established\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nThis concept that if you lie\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\nWhen you put your hand on the Bible\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\nYou go to hell\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.000\nAnd not only go to hell but my mom\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nShe told me articles about\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nThis is going to make my mom sound like some kind of\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:34.000\nCrazy character from Justified\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.000\nI mean\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:38.000\nI take that back\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:40.000\nShe didn't show me articles\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:42.000\nShe told me about articles\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:44.000\nShe said in the news\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nThere's this thing called spontaneous combustion\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:48.000\nHave you ever heard of that\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:50.000\nPeople just walking down the street\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:52.000\nWhy do you think that happens\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:54.000\nI think we figured out later that spontaneous combustion\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:56.000\nIs people that fell asleep in a room\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:58.000\nWith a cigarette in their hand\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:00.000\nThere's a set of circumstances that causes the body\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:02.000\nTo not burst into flames\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\nThey call it spontaneous combustion\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nBecause you don't find the body until\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\nIt's basically smoldered\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:10.000\nFor a month\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\nWhen you find it\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nIt looks like someone\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:16.000\nThat just must have exploded into flames\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.000\nI don't think that's why they call it\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nSpontaneous combustion though\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nWhat do you mean? It's because they\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nSpontaneously burst into flames\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.000\nThat's what they think\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nIt's like crib death\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nThey call it spontaneous combustion\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nBecause you don't find them until a month later\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nThat's not why\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nSo are you talking to your parents about it\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nThey call it spontaneous combustion\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nEven though they never actually saw a person\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nSpontaneously combust\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nWhat they would find is\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nThese half chart carcasses\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nThat when you look at the crime scene\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nOr whatever it is\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nIt looks like\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nSpontaneous combustion occurred\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nIt wasn't spontaneous\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nIt was a slow rendering of body fat\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:00.000\nOver the course of a month\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nWith no friends or no support system\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\nIsn't that like an industrial age\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:06.000\nIdea or like a post Edwardian\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:08.000\nLike it has to\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:10.000\nWas partnered with\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nJust your mom calling it news\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:14.000\nThat's all I know she didn't say\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:16.000\nI know that in the Milwaukee Times\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:18.000\nThey didn't say\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nYou don't have to\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:22.000\nAttack my mom\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:26.000\nI peed my pants two years ago\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nThis is another heroic story\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nThis is about you taking back the night\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:34.000\nBecause\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:36.000\nAll these stories about\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:38.000\nThis oppression\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:40.000\nOf like children\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nIf you're caught peeing in your pants\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nLike children are awful\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.000\nLike they'll go look at Ravi\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.000\nHe peed his pants\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nAnd the teachers are going\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\nYou peed your pants\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\nYou peed your pants man\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.000\nYou peed your pants man\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:58.000\nYou peed your pants man\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:00.000\nWhat is Amerigo Vespucci do\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:02.000\nNo way you peed your pants\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.000\nWhat is Susan Sarandon's say\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:06.000\nSusan Sarandon says\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nYou peed your pants\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.000\nI don't know\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.000\nWhat is Two-Face saying\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:14.000\nYou peed your\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:16.000\nBoth of your pants\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nReally quick, what does Spencer say\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nOh you peed your pants in the back\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nI better clean that out\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nGet all these bell tacos out of here\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nThat sounds kind of like\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nAn American The Beatles\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:32.000\nYeah\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:36.000\nAmerican The Beatles\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nThey're from Statepool\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nNo but I was\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:42.000\nUm\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.000\nI live in London\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.000\nYou've been in a situation\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.000\nWhere you're like\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:50.000\nAt Fox or you're on the other side\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:52.000\nYou're in Santa Monica\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nOr something like that\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nAnd you leave a meeting and you're going\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nAlright great talking to you\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nAlright we'll see you later\n\n37:00.000

driving from\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:10.000\nLike\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nOver by Santa\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\nBy Fox\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:16.000\nDriving down\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:18.000\nOlympic to get to\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.000\nLos Feliz where I live\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nAnd halfway there\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nI go\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:26.000\nShit\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nI have to pee\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:30.000\nAnd it gets worse\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:32.000\nAnd worse and I'm like\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:34.000\nI'm doing the butt dance and the car\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:36.000\nGoing oh god damn it\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nAnother red light and I just like\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:40.000\nOh\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:42.000\nAnd it's starting to hurt\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:44.000\nAnd I'm crossing my legs\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:46.000\nAnd I'm doing like the thigh slap\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:48.000\nAnd I'm turning up the air\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:50.000\nConditioner rolling up and down\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.000\nThe window\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:54.000\nRolling them up and down\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:56.000\nI'm just keeping my mind and other stuff\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\nAnd I'm just like\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:00.000\nOkay just hold on\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.000\nAll the tricks\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.000\nI get to\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nI get to that place\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:08.000\nOn Virgil where it's like\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:10.000\nNext to the Kentucky Fried Chicken\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\nOr whatever and at one point I go\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:14.000\nI could go to the Kentucky Fried Chicken\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:16.000\nAt this red light\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:18.000\nRun out, take a piss and come back\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:20.000\nBut for some reason\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.000\nMy brain thinking that there was like a toilet\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:24.000\nIt started going\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:26.000\nTime to open up the floodgates\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.000\nAnd I go\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:30.000\nCrap and grab my crotch\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:32.000\nAnd\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:34.000\nKind of tap it off\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:36.000\nLike a tourniquet\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.000\nAnd then everything else goes\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:40.000\nAll the way up to where my things\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nAnd I'm like okay well\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:44.000\nWait like a snake spalling a mouse\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:46.000\nLike what do you mean?\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:48.000\nOkay\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:50.000\nFor those of us with a penis just\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:52.000\nYeah\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:56.000\nIt's a hose\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.000\nOkay\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:00.000\nPretend like it's a garden hose\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.000\nWater and the water's going up to the top\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:04.000\nSo it would resemble a snake\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:06.000\nSwallowing a mouse\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:08.000\nIt's throwing up a mouse\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:10.000\nIt's not swallowing anything\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.000\nI think the mouse is the penis she said\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\nYou'll have to forgive her she hasn't seen a penis in a month\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:18.000\nAlright\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:20.000\nWell anyway\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:22.000\nMost guys know when you do that\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:24.000\nYou're beyond the point of no return\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:26.000\nBecause the minute you go like this\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:28.000\nIt's everywhere\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:30.000\nAnd this was with the pants on\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:32.000\nSo it's like\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:34.000\nI'm dead man walking right here\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:36.000\nBecause\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:38.000\nYeah I can drive home with one hand\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:40.000\nBut the minute I walk out of the car\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:42.000\nNext to the fucking Armenian people\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:44.000\nThat\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:46.000\nLive next door to be that hate me\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:48.000\nAnd I hate them because they park me in\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:50.000\nI'm gonna open up the door\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:52.000\nHolding my crotch\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:54.000\nLooking at them\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nThey're looking at me with their fat ugly retarded kids\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\nAnd just\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:00.000\nI'm just gonna be like\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:02.000\nAnd I should have done this\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nBoom! This is what you wanted to see people\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nFireworks\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:10.000\nI'm human\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:12.000\nBut I didn't give them the satisfaction\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:14.000\nAnd I'm having like this\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:16.000\nInternal dialogue\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:18.000\nThe entire way home\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:20.000\nAnd I'm like going\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nI really screwed up this time\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:24.000\nReally having a bad like sweaty\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:26.000\nReally painful like I felt like\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:28.000\nI'm doing some damage like\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nSomebody's gonna blow up\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:32.000\nSomebody's gonna tell me\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:34.000\nYou know you really should have done that\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:36.000\nI always think about Abe Simpson and the Simpsons\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:38.000\nLike the episode where Homer\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:40.000\nMakes his dad hold his pee in the car\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:42.000\nAnd his kidneys explode\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:44.000\nYeah I feel like that\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:46.000\nI always imagine that in my head\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:48.000\nYeah I feel like that you know I'm getting to that age\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:50.000\nAnd I'm just driving along\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.000\nAnd driving along at all these\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:54.000\nAmerican securities of like\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:56.000\nOh Robby you peed your pants\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:58.000\nOr Robby you peed your pants\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:00.000\nRobby they're all\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:02.000\nRobby you peed your pants\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:04.000\nRobby you peed your pants\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:06.000\nFull score and seven years ago\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:08.000\nYou peed your pants\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nFor some reason Wesley Snipes comes through\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:12.000\nSeeing from demolition man\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:14.000\nHe has pants and is like\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:16.000\nAlways bet on Rob peeing his pants\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:18.000\nAnd\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:20.000\nAnd I\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:22.000\nLike just said to the universe\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:24.000\nAnd I said you know something at the time\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:26.000\nI'm\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:28.000\n39 years old\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.000\nI'm an adult\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:32.000\nI can do whatever the fuck I want\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:34.000\nAnd I went boom\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:36.000\nAnd I\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:38.000\nPissed all over myself\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:40.000\nAnd I said it's my car\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:42.000\nMy pants\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:44.000\nMy life\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:46.000\nAnd I drove home with the\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\nTake that Obama\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:50.000\nAnd\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:52.000\nAnd\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:54.000\nThe music was cracked\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:56.000\nAnd the very first thing I did\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:58.000\nAfter I pissed my pants\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:00.000\nLike I put my headset on\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:02.000\nAnd I called Ryan Ridley\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:04.000\nAnd I go guess what I\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:06.000\nJust did\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:08.000\nAnd I told him\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:10.000\nThe whole thing and he said\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:12.000\nSo badass man\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:14.000\nHe doesn't\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:16.000\nAgreed with me that's\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:18.000\nThat's what you get\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:20.000\nHeroes come in all sizes\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:22.000\nLet's play some D&D\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:24.000\nYeah let's play\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:26.000\nSorry that was long and forced in there\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:28.000\nBut I had to shit\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:30.000\nAnd in answer to your question\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:32.000\nWhy did they get quiet\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\nAudiences are conditioned when people start talking\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:36.000\nAbout human shit\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nTo expect a dramatic\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:40.000\nEvolution to happen\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:42.000\nBecause it's always darkest before the dawn\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:44.000\nThey know from storytelling and their bones\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:46.000\nThey're literally talking\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:48.000\nAbout fecal matter\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:50.000\nSo it can't get any worse\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.000\nWhich means there's going to be some kind of bloom\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:54.000\nOf humanity, a triumph\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:56.000\nUnless Dino's here\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nIn which case yeah there's more to go\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:00.000\nYeah we could go deeper\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:02.000\nI keep trying to get Dino down here\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:04.000\nHe won't get him down here\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:06.000\nYeah it's hard to wrangle him\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:08.000\nHe keeps on peeing in the car on the way over\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:10.000\nHe's a free spirit\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\nThat was a one time thing\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:14.000\nI feel like peeing my pants\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:16.000\nNot walking into a board room\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:18.000\nAnd going hey how you doing\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:20.000\nDon't apologize to these 25 year olds\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:22.000\nThey don't know what it's like\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:24.000\nI'm apologizing to the would be\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:26.000\nHierers\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:28.000\nThese guys are seven years past\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nJust\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nNot peeing their pants\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:34.000\nFor real\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:36.000\nI think\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:38.000\nWhat? Really?\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:40.000\nThey're that young\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:42.000\nJust give me a glow stick\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:44.000\nI'm going to rave\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.000\nBut you and I are in a new\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:48.000\nWe're Gandalf the White\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:50.000\nWe got killed by a ball rock\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\nWe don't give a fuck\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:54.000\nThat's how I felt like I felt like Gandalf\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\nIt was just like if I walked in\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:58.000\nYou know like\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:00.000\nHe just came in\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:02.000\nAnd just piss everywhere\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:04.000\nI felt the same way when I was walking home\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nFrom that soccer practice\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:08.000\nLike you felt like a hero\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:10.000\nLike a monster\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:12.000\nTrail of piss behind you\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:16.000\nWell my car was\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:18.000\nWere my shoes\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nMy feet\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:22.000\nLet's play some D&D\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nWhat happened\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:26.000\nSomebody\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:28.000\nOk\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:30.000\nYes let's\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:32.000\nI don't but I can see the clock\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:34.000\nNow through the paper\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:36.000\nStop looking at it\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:38.000\nI'm going to lose anyway\n\n44:38.000 --> 44:40.000\nCan I read\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:42.000\nCan we use this music for me to read one\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:44.000\nReddit comment\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:46.000\nThat I got today in the community subreddit\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:48.000\nIn response to me talking about how\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.000\nI don't like it\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\nWhen people's\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.000\nPlay the music again in a second\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.000\nThis is a comment in response to me\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:58.000\nStarting a thread where\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nI expressed the emotion\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nI don't care about the debate\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.000\nI expressed the emotion\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nWhich made me feel a lot better\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nI'm in very good mood because I did this today\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:10.000\nI expressed the fact that\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:12.000\nWhen people blame season 4\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\nOn season 3 it makes me want to kill myself\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:16.000\nIt makes me want to barf\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:18.000\nAnd die\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:20.000\nIt bums me out\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.000\nIt doesn't mean stop doing it\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:24.000\nIt doesn't mean you're wrong\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.000\nIt doesn't mean anything\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:28.000\nI just want to say\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:30.000\nWhen I stumble into a Reddit thread\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:32.000\nWhere somebody eventually brings up\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:34.000\nWell, if you think about it\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:36.000\nThe reason season 4 sucked\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:38.000\nIs because season 3 did this, this and that\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nWhat's the\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nI mean\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:44.000\nI don't want to hash it out\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:46.000\nBecause then it's misquoted\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.000\nTomorrow in a thing\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nI just want to read this one\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nI quote this\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:54.000\nI don't get it\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:58.000\nAnd it's great\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:00.000\nPeople shower me with praise and I'm not complaining about anything\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nI want to read this one comment\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:04.000\nThat I got in addition to all the amazing things\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:06.000\nPeople say to me all the time online\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nI have a great life, more than I deserve\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:10.000\nI have nothing to complain about\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:12.000\nYou are more than you deserve\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nI'm not a martyr\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:16.000\nI don't have a bad life\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:18.000\nI'm rich and satisfied\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:20.000\nAnd I do everything I want to do\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:22.000\nBut I think this is just a funny thing\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:24.000\nThat I received as a comment\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:26.000\nAmidst the other comments\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nSo cue the music\n\n46:28.000 -->

up\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:44.000\nStand it over for the edit\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\nStand it over for the other\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.000\nDustin, it was for you\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.000\nTo sync the audio\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:56.000\nFor your feral audio\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.000\nTo sync the audio there\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.000\nFor your podcast\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:02.000\nTo sync the audio to the time track\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nSo the tracks are timed\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nDustin, another person that hates my guts\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\nOn Instagram\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.000\nAlright, more on that\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\nNo, backstory, fuck it\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\nAlright\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nShut up, you faggot\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nYour show is worthless\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nAnd so are you\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:24.000\nIf you weren't a worthless piece of shit\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:26.000\nYou could make good TV\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\nLike Breaking Bad\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nBut you're worthless\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nSo just wait until this season\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\nLives up to nobody's expectations\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nFails to please the network\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:43.000\nGets canned\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nAnd you kill yourself\n\n47:45.000 -->

Okay\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:00.000\nFag\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nOoh, I think I'll be using\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:08.000\nMayfair on this one\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:11.000\nMayfair, definitely a Mayfair situation\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:15.000\nWhat do you think that commenter\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nWhat do you think that commenter's definition\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nOf fag is?\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:21.000\nSomeone who won't read his pilot\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nLet's play some D&D\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nHere we go\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.000\nDungeons & Dragons time\n\n48:30.000 -->

how to articulate\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:44.000\nTake it away, Spencer\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:46.000\nI guess the show said\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:48.000\nTake it away, Spencer\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:50.000\nI

Birthday to you\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:36.000\nBy the way, I hate the Happy Birthday song\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nIsn't it copyrighted?\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:40.000\nLike, are we in trouble?\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:42.000\nWhat?\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\nIsn't it a copyrighted song?\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:46.000\nNo, you know what we can do\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:48.000\nYou know what I do\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\nBecause I hate the Happy Birthday song\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\nBecause I have a theory\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:54.000\nNobody wants to sing it\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:56.000\nAnd nobody wants to hear it\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nRight?\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\nEverybody's just kind of sitting there\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:02.000\nBecause it sounds like you're in church\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:04.000\nRight now\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:06.000\nAnd then there's some idiot in the background\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\nHarmonizing\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:10.000\nAnd you

real quick?\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nNo, it's the same song\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:34.000\nEddie Murphy to you\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nIt's the same song\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:40.000\nEddie Murphy

artist\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:04.000\nYou demand cultural efficacy\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:06.000\nNobody likes a Happy Birthday song\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:08.000\nNobody likes hearing it\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:10.000\nNo one likes singing it\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nIt's just one of these bullshit things\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:14.000\nThat we fucking do\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:16.000\nAnd I know we're cutting into Dungeons & Dragons\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nIt's fine\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nFirst of all, congrats on your win\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.000\nSecond of all, I agree with you\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\nI hate the Happy Birthday song\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nBut what I hate more than the Happy Birthday song\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.000\nIs when you're Benny Hanna or wherever\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\nAnd they have their own\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:32.000\nHappy Happy Birthday\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:34.000\nPringles and a thing and a\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:36.000\nWe'll

52:58.000\nI like how you say\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nRob's a control freak\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\nI didn't say I wasn't\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:04.000\nDan Harmon said\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:06.000\nRob's a control freak\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:08.000\nHow dare you\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:10.000\nCome on Harmontown\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\nI didn't say I wasn't\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nWe did along because of it\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:16.000\nI don't like\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:18.000\nThe Birthday song\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:20.000\nI don't like hearing it\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:22.000\nOn my birthday, I'm sitting there\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:24.000\nEverybody's looking at me singing this\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:26.000\nFuneral dirge of a song\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nThat these two old\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nMoney-grubbing ladies\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:32.000\nEvery time Jim Benny sings\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:34.000\nWe get 10%\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:36.000\nOh\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:38.000\nFuck you\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:40.000\nDo you remember the first moment that you saw Dan?\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:42.000\nYes\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:44.000\nI think I was\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:46.000\nWe were doing stand-up in\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nWe were doing stand-up in Milwaukee\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\nAt the L.A. Freeway\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\nI've told this story too many times\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nAnd I was playing like make tracks\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.000\nBecause I was nervous\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:58.000\nBecause I was about to do stand-up for the first time\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:00.000\nAnd I think\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nWhat is a make track?\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:04.000\nIt's a video game\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:06.000\nCoin-operated\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:08.000\nVideo game\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:10.000\nIt was a third-tier\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:12.000\nPac-Man rip-off\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\nThere was a barrel hoop and a stick\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:16.000\nWhen you said make track\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:18.000\nI thought that was an old one\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:20.000\nI had a bowler hat on\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.000\nI thought that was an antiquated term\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:24.000\nFor a mix tape\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\nIt was all sepia-toned\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:30.000\nI was like\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:32.000\nI know what it was\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nI hope I can figure this out\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:36.000\nHe said it in my first impulse\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:38.000\nImagine a 25-year-old Rob\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:40.000\nTouching\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:42.000\nSome kind of touch pad thing\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:44.000\nOn the bar of a thing\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\nWe didn't even have cell phones back then\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:48.000\nIn the movies\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:50.000\nYou knew someone was rich\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:52.000\nBecause they would pull out a giant VHS cassette-sized phone\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nNo one had cell phones\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:56.000\nWe were walking around a wasteland\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:58.000\nPeople would walk up and they didn't have\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:00.000\nA gallon of water\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:02.000\nTied around their waist\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:04.000\nWe're on a Geiger counter\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:06.000\nThey'd be like\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:08.000\nWhat's a little fall-out between friends?\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:10.000\nI'm sorry, that's thunder-dome\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:12.000\nI was going to say it sounds very post-apocalyptic\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:14.000\nThis is how old we are\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:16.000\nBecause remember\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:18.000\nWhen we were growing\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:20.000\nBack in the early 90s\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:22.000\nThis was another thing\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:24.000\nLike the cell phone\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:26.000\nYou knew somebody in a movie was a douche\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:28.000\nWith their car keys\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:30.000\nAnd went\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:32.000\nDouchebag, how dare you\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:34.000\nRichie Rich\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:36.000\nRichie Rich with your\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:38.000\nRemote control car lock\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:40.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:42.000\nI remember when we got our first cell phones\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:44.000\nAnd our phone numbers were one number apart\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:46.000\nBecause Rob got them for both of us\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:48.000\nBecause we had just become producers\n\n55:48.000 --> 55:50.000\nOn a TV pilot\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:52.000\nAnd we needed our phones\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:54.000\nWe were the only people that didn't have phones\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:56.000\nSo Rob and Harvard, give me your numbers\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:58.000\nSo Rob, tell me about what you first\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:00.000\n414\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:02.000\nAnd I go, ooh, the Lovers Package\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:04.000\nGot that all the time\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:06.000\nRob, when you first saw Dan, what was\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:08.000\nIt was, you know\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:10.000\nKind of a Wingsworld\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:12.000\nMoment of\n\n56:12.000 --> 56:14.000\nStar Filters\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:16.000\nDid you see him on stage first or in person?\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:18.000\nProbably\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:20.000\nI remember seeing you\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:22.000\nYou did stand up before I did\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:24.000\nYou were 21\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:26.000\nRob, what was Dan's\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:28.000\nPoint of view at that time as a stand up?\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:30.000\nYou want to know what his act was like?\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:32.000\nYeah, like I feel like\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:34.000\nA very big fan of Jen Kirkman\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:36.000\nWho talks about not wanting to\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:38.000\nYeah, Jen Kirkman's great\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:40.000\nAs an example, her point of view is that\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:42.000\nShe doesn't necessarily\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:44.000\nShe has this book\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:46.000\nGet to the Dungeons & Dragons\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:48.000\nJust quit looking at me for two seconds\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:50.000\nSo one of the\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:52.000\nKirkman is independent\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:54.000\nAnd open about her neuroses\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:56.000\nAnd not wanting to have children\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:58.000\nWhat was Dan Harmon's point of view at that time?\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:00.000\nKind of\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:02.000\nI only remember really titles of\n\n57:02.000 --> 57:04.000\nI know my Closer was a wrap about\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:06.000\nMaster Basics\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:08.000\nSo nothing has changed\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:10.000\nA good 8 minutes of Jeffrey Dahmer jokes\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:12.000\nWho was eating people at the time\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:14.000\nSo it was a hot, funny topic\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:16.000\nYeah\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:18.000\nI got a story about that\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:20.000\nWhen\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:22.000\nYou had like a bit about\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:24.000\nLike Johnny Carson\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:26.000\nFucking Ed McMahon in the butt\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:28.000\nThis isn't going to make anyone happy\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:30.000\nWell my stand up was like\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:32.000\nOh, what if Batman\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:34.000\nWas taking a shit when the bats came up\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:36.000\nI'm going to ask this question of both of you\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:38.000\nYou both are\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:40.000\nWhat year is this?\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:42.000\n92\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:44.000\nNo, it might have been 91\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:46.000\nBecause I was turning\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:48.000\nNo, no, no\n\n57:48.000 --> 57:50.000\nI was about to turn 92\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:52.000\nAnd I\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:54.000\nI was about to turn 22\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:56.000\nAnd I wanted to be a stand up comedian\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:58.000\nWhile I was 21\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:00.000\nOkay, it doesn't matter\n\n58:00.000 --> 58:02.000\nYou're both club promoters\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:04.000\nIn 1991\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:06.000\nAnd neither of you\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:08.000\nAre comics, but you're familiar with the other person\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:10.000\nYou have like one\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:12.000\nIn the newspaper they're like\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:14.000\nDan Harmon's come into the\n\n58:14.000 -->

person\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:24.000\nKnowing what you know about each other at the time\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:26.000\nAt the time\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:28.000\nCome see Dan Harmon\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:30.000\nCome see\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:32.000\nNelly Furtado\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:34.000\nIs that your stage name?\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:36.000\nNo, I have this\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:38.000\nPlaylist\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:40.000\nCome see Nelly Furtado\n\n58:40.000 --> 58:42.000\nShe sings about\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:44.000\nFreedom\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:46.000\nYes, please don't\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:48.000\nYou don't have to say what audience\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:50.000\nI can hear you\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:52.000\nHow do you\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:54.000\nHow do you promote the other person\n\n58:54.000 --> 58:56.000\nCome see\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:58.000\nCarrot Top\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:00.000\nHis props will bring you\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:02.000\nTo a grave of laughter\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:06.000\nGo easy on them folks\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:08.000\nThey're just starting out\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:10.000\nYeah, there was a lot of that\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:12.000\nThere was a lot of that\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:14.000\nBut I want to know\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:16.000\nThere's a lot of that\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:18.000\nI would do stand up\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:20.000\nAnd then the guy who was the emcee\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:22.000\nGive it up, comedy's hard guys\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:24.000\nCome on\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:26.000\nCome on, this isn't easy folks\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:28.000\nWhat do you think you can do better\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:30.000\nThat was Rob Schrobblet, he's a gentleman\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:32.000\nHard business\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:34.000\nThat's a given because you guys are starting out\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:36.000\nAnd this is something I've asked you about before\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:38.000\nAnd I can't get a straight answer\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:40.000\n17 years old\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:42.000\nBut as an exercise\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:44.000\nHow do you\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:46.000\nYou're a club promoter\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:48.000\nCome see Rob Schrobb\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:50.000\nNo, you're describing\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:52.000\nDo you?\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:54.000\nSpencer, it's a hypothetical\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:56.000\nShe's trying to\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:58.000\nFigure out a way for us\n\n59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000\nTo answer the question\n\n01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nCan't hypothetical situations usually exist though?\n\n01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nNo, because they're hypothetical\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nThey could, in theory, that's why\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000\nYou do it, you don't do\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nHypothetically, what if an aided thing\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000\nI guess\n\n01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nThere's no need to shut down\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nI think Dan knows what you're talking about\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nDo you want this to be grounded or emotionally driven\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nDo you mean\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nIs there a difference?\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nIn the grounded version it would just be\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nNo, I do not want it to be grounded\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nI want to know what kind of comedy you were doing\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000\nAt the time\n\n01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000\nBut I want you to present it\n\n01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000\nAs club promoter\n\n01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000\nIt's not a crazy thing\n\n01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nYou don't have to be defensive about it\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nI'm being defensive towards Spencer\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nWho last made sense that we were in\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000\nDifferent generations\n\n01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000\nYeah, you are\n\n01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nYou are\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nBy five years\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nAnyway\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000\nWe're getting bogged down\n\n01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000\nWe are\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000\nI'm so sorry\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nThat now I'm committing to this\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nI'd really like to know\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nIf I may, I think you're not\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000\nAsking for a performance driven thing\n\n01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nYou just want to know what it was like\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000\nGive us some experience\n\n01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000\nI assume that you guys were starting out\n\n01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000\nSo you don't need to know that\n\n01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nIt was amateur or whatever\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nI just want to know what your point of view at the time was\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nI just found out that Dan was making jokes\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nAbout Jeffrey Dahmer, which is really interesting\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nI'm just curious how you would plug the other person\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nIf they were\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nHere's the thing\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nFamous comic\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nHow do you plug that person?\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000\nI fell in love with Dan Zack\n\n01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nBefore I fell in love with him\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nBecause he\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000\nWould do what I liked\n\n01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000\nWas talking about pop culture\n\n01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000\nAnd I was obsessed and still am with pop culture\n\n01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nSo as a club promoter\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000\nWhat would you say?\n\n01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nCome see Dan Harmon\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:02.000\nThis is a newspaper\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nI don't know\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nI think it's 9-11 again\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nBut not on the clock\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nThis is a rubble and corpse based\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000\nObservation\n\n01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nUm\n\n01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000\nDan Harmon's witty\n\n01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000\nObservational

--> 01:03:48.000\nWhat if Tonto\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000\nFrom Lone Ranger\n\n01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000\nAnd McCoy\n\n01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000\nFrom Star Trek\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000\nBoth ended up on a planet full of dead people\n\n01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000\nAnd\n\n01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nHe would be Tonto going\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000\nHim dead Kimosabe\n\n01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nHe's dead Jim\n\n01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000\nHim dead Kimosabe\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000\nHe's dead Jim\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nAnd then\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000\nAnd then there's a split screen\n\n01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nAnd it's just the two of them\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nAnd they're

crying\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000\nBecause they missed the Lone Ranger\n\n01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000\nAnd Jim\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nI forgot about the split screen\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000\nThe split screen is the funny part\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000\nBecause it was stand up that had a split screen\n\n01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000\nThat's what I was like\n\n01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000\nThis guy\n\n01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nWhat was the fat woman\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nIn the elevator joke\n\n01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000\nJust a

act\n\n01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nIs because they were afraid to do it\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000\nI did not understand comedy\n\n01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nI was a terrible stand up\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000\nEveryone here respects you\n\n01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nI accept that\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000\nBut\n\n01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000\nI was doing terrible\n\n01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000\nMarquette\n\n01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000\nWas it Marquette that you kind of went to\n\n01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000\nAnd then left? Yes\n\n01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000\nSo you got a Marquette and you're in the dorm\n\n01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000\nAnd I'm sitting there\n\n01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nDo you want me to just\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000\nNo I don't\n\n01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000\nBecause I'm embarrassed about it\n\n01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nI'm embarrassed to say it\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nI'm going to say instead of cunt\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000\nC-word\n\n01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000\nBecause I thought that was acceptable\n\n01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nTo say\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nBut even back then\n\n01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000\nIn 1991\n\n01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nThe whole room went\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000\nYou don't say the c-word\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nIn your stand up act\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000\nStop saying that word\n\n01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nIt's the word\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000\nIt was like\n\n01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nI go to Marquette and I'm going to the dorm\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000\nAnd I get in the elevator\n\n01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000\nAnd I press one\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nAnd there's these fat c-words\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nThat are there\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000\nAnd they say\n\n01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nCouldn't you take the stairs\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nAnd I go okay I'll get off\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nOn 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nAnd take the stairs\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nBye\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000\nIt was awful\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000\nNo it didn't\n\n01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nNo one laughed\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nEveryone was sad for me\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nThey could see from my acne that I was young enough\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nThat it was weird that I was there\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000\nYou were 17, 18\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nI was not\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000\n18 and he was not 17\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nI was 21\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000\n18 and I actually got him in trouble\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nBecause the woman that I was dating\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nWas\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nThe girl that I was dating\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000\nThat was absolutely dating\n\n01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nFive other guys\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000\nAt the same time\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000\nWas\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nShe was a waitress at the bar\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nAnd we were living together at the time\n\n01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000\nWhen she was not having sex with everybody else\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nIn the world\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000\nAnd I'm rolling over\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nYou know\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000\nDan's funny right\n\n01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000\nYeah whatever\n\n01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nYou know he's only 18\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nAnd he's so much funnier than me\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nI just don't understand it\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000\nHe's 18, I've been serving him drinks\n\n01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nShit\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000\nDan kicked out\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000\nOf

--> 01:07:22.000\nThat was our first\n\n01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nI was playing matrix\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nAnd I was worried\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000\nBecause I was about to do\n\n01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nMy first stand up\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000\nOpen mic\n\n01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000\nAnd somebody told Dan\n\n01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000\nYou came over\n\n01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000\nAnd you said\n\n01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nHey brother\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000\nDon't worry about it, it's gonna be fine\n\n01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000\nAnd walked away\n\n01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000\nAnd I felt like\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000\nYou know it is gonna be fine\n\n01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000\nWith this woman was it a secret\n\n01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000\nThat she was dating other people\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nTo me it was\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000\nBut everybody else was fucking

with everyone\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nYes\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nCome on out Tammy\n\n01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000\nShe's full of holes\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nCome on

gotcha\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000\nThere must have been a moment between the two of you\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000\nThat was like your big thawning moment\n\n01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000\nWhere you're sitting at the edge of a dock\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000\nThrowing rocks into a river, what was your\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000\nIt's a big, great world

slow burn\n\n01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000\nI think we were always\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nLike\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nThat was that party\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nThe

01:17:12.000\nLike one fourth of the way\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000\nYeah, you're about a quarter\n\n01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000\nInto the room from the walls\n\n01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000\nI get it, is there an opening\n\n01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000\nOn\n\n01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000\nLike if I, like Donkey Kong Jr.\n\n01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000\nSwung from the\n\n01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000\nThe chains over\n\n01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000\nTo\n\n01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000\nIs there a place for me to go\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000\nIs there a point A and B in this\n\n01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000\nYou can kind of jump amongst these\n\n01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000\nChain, like, tangle of chains\n\n01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000\nThat's all you can manage\n\n01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000\nThe only way that was\n\n01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000\nThe way in was a door\n\n01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000\nAnd that's covered in lava\n\n01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000\nAre there any free-floating bunches of bananas\n\n01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000\nOr oranges\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000\nThat might be of value\n\n01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000\nNope, just chains\n\n01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000\nOn the walls\n\n01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000\nAnd we were on top of these stone lions\n\n01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000\nWhen Brefie came down\n\n01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000\nSo Brefie's down and he's mad\n\n01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000\nWell, I mean, you don't know it's emotions\n\n01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000\nI'm about to find out\n\n01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000\nBecause they call me in this game\n\n01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000\nThe great communicator\n\n01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000\nBrefie\n\n01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000\nIt's me, Sharpie\n\n01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000\nOf the famous dirty\n\n01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000\nFour\n\n01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000\nOh, okay\n\n01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000\nI imagine you're angry with us\n\n01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000\nFor destroying\n\n01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000\nYour brethren\n\n01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000\nAnd then murdering you while Jeff\n\n01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000\nFucked you\n\n01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000\nIf I'm getting that right\n\n01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000\nIt was a weird night and\n\n01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000\nI think that's how it ended\n\n01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000\nI tie the yarn\n\n01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000\nThat I have around my head\n\n01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000\nLike a bow so I seem less\n\n01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000\nIntimidating\n\n01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000\nYou seem less intimidating\n\n01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000\nBut we have been through a lot\n\n01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000\nSince then, as have you\n\n01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000\nAnd we\n\n01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000\nOnly ever\n\n01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000\nFeel remorse when we\n\n01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000\nTalk about what happened that night\n\n01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000\nAnd we\n\n01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000\nFeel, although we're biased\n\n01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000\nThat that's enough\n\n01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000\nDestroy\n\n01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000\nYou didn't let me finish\n\n01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000\nDestroy\n\n01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000\nOkay, if you're going to be rude\n\n01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000\nYou're going to start\n\n01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nTo put me in a social corner\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000\nAnd I think we need to start\n\n01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000\nYanking on these chains\n\n01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000\nI think we got to start pulling and yanking on chains\n\n01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000\nEverybody grab it, even the women\n\n01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000\nJust drag\n\n01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000\nYank on these chains\n\n01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000\nAs hard as we can, we might open up a trap door\n\n01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000\nThat's inverted and sneak out\n\n01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000\nOr a thing\n\n01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000\nYou know, just start yanking on the closest chain\n\n01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000\nEverybody got a chain\n\n01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000\nI got two\n\n01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000\nYou got a close chain\n\n01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000\nYou can yank on because maybe\n\n01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000\nI mean, there got to exist for some reason\n\n01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000\nSo yank on a chain\n\n01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000\nSomebody, anyone?\n\n01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000\nCome on!\n\n01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000\nAll right, we're, the both of us\n\n01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000\nAre yanking on some chains\n\n01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000\nI don't see any chain yanking on your end of the line\n\n01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000\nI want to cast Mage Armor\n\n01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000\nOkay\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000\nAnd yank on a chain\n\n01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000\nThank you\n\n01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000\nHow are we doing over there, Quark?\n\n01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000\nYou want to yank on a chain?\n\n01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000\nAre you too awesome?\n\n01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000\nNo, I am certainly not too awesome\n\n01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000\nI will\n\n01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000\nI'm going to, really quick\n\n01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000\nAnd this is outside of the game\n\n01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000\nOne of my special abilities says\n\n01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000\nEliterate?\n\n01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000\nYeah\n\n01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000\nIt's a condition affecting\n\n01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000\nMillions of Americans\n\n01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000\nYou framed it as a special ability\n\n01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000\nFor\n\n01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000\nThe country's gotten that bad\n\n01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000\nHey man, I don't know what it says\n\n01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000\nJust follow my heart, I don't know what that sign says\n\n01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000\nThere's no handicap section\n\n01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000\nOn the character sheets, you have to put it somewhere\n\n01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000\nOne of my special abilities says\n\n01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, guest star, come on\n\n01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000\nOne of my special abilities says\n\n01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000\nCocoa exclamation point\n\n01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000\nThat is a horse and your soulmate\n\n01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000\nYeah\n\n01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000\nGet your horse to yank on a chain\n\n01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000\nAlso not a special\n\n01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000\nWith his mouth\n\n01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000\nCocoa's not here\n\n01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000\nI yank on a chain\n\n01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000\nYou're all yanking on chains\n\n01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000\nYeah\n\n01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000\nThey're just tangled up\n\n01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000\nAnd bolted to the walls\n\n01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000\nSo it's like doing nothing\n\n01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000\nPretty much\n\n01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000\nI jump down and I punch\n\n01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000\nYou jump down into the lava?\n\n01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000\nNo, I don't jump down into lava\n\n01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000\nThen where do you jump down to?\n\n01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000\nTo the top of one of the statues\n\n01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000\nYou're on the statues\n\n01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000\nYou're on the...\n\n01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000\nAlright, how far away is Breffi?\n\n01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000\nHe's up in this chains\n\n01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000\nHe's about 30 feet off ahead of you\n\n01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000\nHe's kind of in the middle of them\n\n01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000\nOkay, I use my climbing ability\n\n01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000\nI tie one of my knives\n\n01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000\nTo my head with my\n\n01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000\nWith my yarn\n\n01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000\nAnd I go up to him like a\n\n01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000\nLike a norwhal\n\n01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000\nAnd I stab him in the face\n\n01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000\nWhat?\n\n01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000\nGary Guyjax just\n\n01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000\nCried out\n\n01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000\nIn the audience\n\n01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000\nHe rolled over in his dice\n\n01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000\nYeah\n\n01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000\nSo leaping into the chains\n\n01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000\nTry to remember that I have the skill of illiteracy\n\n01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000\nYeah\n\n01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000\nBarbarians can't read, it's not a joke\n\n01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000\nThey didn't learn\n\n01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000\nHow to read\n\n01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000\nNumber one special ability is\n\n01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000\nThey were too busy\n\n01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000\nYou should also put a height\n\n01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000\nAnd literally it's a real rule\n\n01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000\nYou have to\n\n01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000\nI read a sign, no you don't\n\n01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000\nYou're illiterate\n\n01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000\nAlso heights on there\n\n01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000\nSo\n\n01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000\nI think our point is that if this game were\n\n01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000\nModern\n\n01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000\nIt would have special disabilities on it\n\n01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000\nOkay, so I'm norwhaling\n\n01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000\nBreffi\n\n01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000\nCan you edit out the 8 minute pause before\n\n01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000\nMy lame joke\n\n01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000\nMake it seem like that gem came right\n\n01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000\nOut of my fucking idiot brain\n\n01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000\nIt's your show man\n\n01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000\nI'm a barbarian\n\n01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000\nI go in a barbarian mini rage\n\n01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000\nAnd I norwhal\n\n01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000\nBreffi\n\n01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000\nOkay, so rules wise is that a real rage or not a real rage\n\n01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000\nIt's a real rage\n\n01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000\nSo leaping into a rage\n\n01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000\nYou climb through these things\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000\nAnd you get so crazy\n\n01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000\nYou don't even know what you're doing\n\n01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000\nYou're just headbutting a guy with a dagger in your face\n\n01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000\nIt doesn't do any damage\n\n01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000\nBecause that's not how daggers should be\n\n01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000\nUsed\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000\nThe universe says\n\n01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000\nThis was the wrong use for the dagger\n\n01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000\nSo gravity pulls it down, what do you mean?\n\n01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000\nNo, how it works is if you were a trained warrior\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000\nFor instance, who knew how to use a dagger\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000\nYou would be a lot less\n\n01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nAccurate with hitting something\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000\nIf it were instead tied to your head\n\n01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000\nBecause\n\n01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000\nYou're used to using with your arms\n\n01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nEveryone knows where their head is\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000\nBut it's not a warrior\n\n01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000\nTechnique\n\n01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000\nIt's just flailing around\n\n01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000\nQuestion\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000\nIt's not as effective, so I mean I rolled it\n\n01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000\nCan we do a kickstarter to fund\n\n01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000\nA pilot that's just Spencer and Aaron\n\n01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000\nDriving\n\n01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000\nAnd her just asking\n\n01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nQuestions about\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nDungeons and Dragons\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000\nWhat was your question Ron?\n\n01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000\nHow long is my ribbon\n\n01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000\nRope? It only goes about 15 feet\n\n01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000\nDon't try to use it creatively\n\n01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000\nJust don't try to tie it to your body\n\n01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000\nWhy would you not tie it?\n\n01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000\nPeople tie things to their bodies all the time\n\n01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000\nThey really don't\n\n01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000\nOkay, so\n\n01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000\nI'm thinking about doing some of the ribbon rope\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000\nBut it depends on how\n\n01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nThe lava is rising\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000\nRight? Slowly\n\n01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nBreffy is\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000\nWhere? He's up above you in this\n\n01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nWeb\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000\nTrying to say a verse\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000\nYeah\n\n01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000\nI'm not complaining about this\n\n01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000\nBecause I like it, but you seem angry tonight\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000\nIt's cool\n\n01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000\nIs everyone kind of freaked out by me stabbing around\n\n01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000\nWith my head? Like do I gain\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000\nSome sort of intimidation points by acting\n\n01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nLike a lunatic? No, he says\n\n01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000\nThis is a guy who doesn't know how to use the weapons\n\n01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000\nI see on his body\n\n01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000\nFair enough\n\n01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000\nHe's got a flaming sword, he ties a dagger to his head\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000\nWhere am I?\n\n01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nAm I on the same\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000\nLion?\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nAm I on the same lion?\n\n01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000\nAm I on the same lion of them?\n\n01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000\nYou're on separate lions\n\n01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000\nOkay, I'm gonna start like shouting\n\n01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000\nReally loud in a high pitched voice\n\n01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nOkay, type casting\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000\nHey!\n\n01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000\nKnock it off over there\n\n01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000\nBigger fish\n\n01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nNice\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000\nLava's getting\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nLarger, right?\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000\nYeah\n\n01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000\nSo, we gotta find a way out\n\n01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000\nI say we\n\n01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000\nGive the pulling on the chains\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000\nOne more try\n\n01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000\nAnd then we'll call\n\n01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000\nWe'll think of something else\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000\nBecause maybe we could\n\n01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000\nCommit to it a little bit more\n\n01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000\nAnd not think it's a stupid idea\n\n01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000\nI think the attitude had a lot to do with it\n\n01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000\nNot working\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nI saw a lot of eye rolling\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nWhile they were pulling on chains\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000\nDo I fit in my backpack?\n\n01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000\nI'm a halfling, do I fit in my backpack?\n\n01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000\nYeah, that's a fine question\n\n01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000\nHalflings have like halfling size\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000\nBackpacks, so unless it was like\n\n01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000\nA huge handy haversack\n\n01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000\nShe could fit in one of our backpacks\n\n01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000\nShe could fit in one normal size backpack\n\n01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000\nMulrainee, can I have your backpack?\n\n01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000\nOr a bag of holding\n\n01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000\nOkay, when do I get another turn?\n\n01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000\nIt's like\n\n01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000\nI don't care if someone do something\n\n01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000\nI'm not gonna do anything until it's\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000\nMy guy's turn\n\n01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nYou don't have to be pouty\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000\nYou control the universe\n\n01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000\nInitiative, why don't you roll initiative?\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nRoll some initiative\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000\nAnd then we can figure this out\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000\nThere you go\n\n01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000\nDan, you go first\n\n01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000\nAlright, here's what I would like to do\n\n01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000\nThat's why you roll initiative\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000\nSo this shit doesn't happen\n\n01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000\nSo we can all stay friends\n\n01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000\nBy the end of this\n\n01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nWe got Jeff Davis' party to go to\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nIt's a good point Rob, I should roll initiative\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000\nTo keep things on track\n\n01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000\nThat is true\n\n01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000\nTeleport Cape\n\n01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000\nOnto this fucking arachnid\n\n01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000\nAssholes back\n\n01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000\nCan I teleport onto his back?\n\n01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nYou can definitely try\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nWhat's he doing on my back?\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000\nA different asshole\n\n01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000\nYou teleport onto his back\n\n01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000\nYou're up on it\n\n01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000\nYou can see the back of his head\n\n01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000\nIt's all covered in metal plates\n\n01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000\nI take my Norwell dagger\n\n01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000\nAnd I shamefully pull it off my head\n\n01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000\nI put it in my pocket\n\n01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000\nAnd I try to read something\n\n01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000\nAnd can't\n\n01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000\nWhat do you guys think of this drawing?\n\n01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000\nIs this waves?\n\n01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000\nWhat does my sun rod do?\n\n01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000\nIt's like a torch\n\n01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000\nWhat did you say?\n\n01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000\nShed's light\n\n01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000\nShed's light\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000\nLike the sun\n\n01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000\nIn a rod\n\n01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000\nYeah, you will\n\n01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000\nWe're not fighting anything\n\n01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000\nTechnically, you are\n\n01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000\nSpeaking of which, I'm just going to go\n\n01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000\nHe shoots chains at all of you guys\n\n01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000\nPull on him\n\n01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000\nEverybody\n\n01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000\nPull on the chain\n\n01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000\nAlright\n\n01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000\nHe's not here\n\n01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000\nChristopher\n\n01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000\nIs there a hook on the end of the chain?\n\n01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nYeah, it stabs into your chest\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000\nAnd you feel it kind of grinding around\n\n01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000\nInside your body\n\n01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000\nYou have\n\n01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000\nYou take 8 damage\n\n01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000\nI have a spell\n\n01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000\nHope you're keeping track of that\n\n01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000\nI don't got a pencil\n\n01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000\nI have a spell called entangle\n\n01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000\nThat sounds promising\n\n01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000\nHow's that?\n\n01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000\nCasting entangle\n\n01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000\nYou try an entangle\n\n01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000\nYou kind of try an entangle\n\n01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000\nBut entangling doesn't happen\n\n01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000\nYou see the chains, they start to shake\n\n01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000\nA little bit like they might move\n\n01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000\nBut then they don't\n\n01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000\nSorry\n\n01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000\nJust let me know when it's my turn\n\n01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000\nYou can go\n\n01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nI don't want to alarm anybody\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000\nI don't want to alarm anybody\n\n01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000\nI kind of start\n\n01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000\nStarting to have to go to the bathroom\n\n01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000\nI'm just like saying\n\n01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nWell, just don't be a hero tonight\n\n01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000\nI'm just saying, it's my life\n\n01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000\nAnd we're going to live it\n\n01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000\nOkay\n\n01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000\nIf it's my turn again, because Mulrainee and I\n\n01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000\nTraded backpacks\n\n01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000\nAnd where I have the human backpack\n\n01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000\nI\n\n01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000\nSpit on the backpack and I wrap\n\n01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000\nMy cloak of resistance around the backpack\n\n01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000\nI poke two holes\n\n01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000\nThrough the bottom and the sides\n\n01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000\nAnd\n\n01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000\nI'm really saying I don't need the backpack\n\n01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000\nI wear\n\n01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000\nThe cloak of resistance\n\n01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000\nI have a wrap around me\n\n01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000\nWith my flaming sword\n\n01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000\nI\n\n01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000\nRush breathy\n\n01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000\nWith\n\n01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000\nThe enthusiasm\n\n01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000\nOf somebody who doesn't know\n\n01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000\nAbout the world, i.e. someone who\n\n01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000\nCan't read\n\n01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000\nI run, I run at him\n\n01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000\nUse your far, far sword\n\n01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000\nThing\n\n01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000\nI use my far sword thing\n\n01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000\nWell, Spencer\n\n01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000\nHey, it's fine\n\n01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000\nYou're already really close to him\n\n01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000\nBecause you wanted to headbutt him\n\n01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000\nWhen I say run, I mean\n\n01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000\nI use my flaming sword\n\n01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000\nAnd before\n\n01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000\nI stab him, I look in his eyes\n\n01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000\nAnd I say, think about\n\n01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000\nYour most vulnerable time\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000\nHave you ever peed in your pants\n\n01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000\nHave you ever pooped in your pants\n\n01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000\nAnd maybe breathy\n\n01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000\nKind of thinks back\n\n01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000\nAnd that's when I stab him between his\n\n01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000\nEyes and I open my mouth\n\n01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000\nSo I can drink his blood\n\n01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000\nSo\n\n01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000\nSay in those words, I'm clinging to the chains\n\n01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000\nYou stab at him with your flaming sword\n\n01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000\nDuring his\n\n01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000\nMoment of introspection\n\n01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000\nBut you miss, apparently\n\n01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000\nIt's pretty hard to cling to chains\n\n01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000\nWhile you're swiping with the sword, I guess\n\n01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000\nSo he doesn't\n\n01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000\nIt turns out the most vulnerable moment\n\n01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000\nWas when you were raping him\n\n01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nJust so you know\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000\nDVD special features\n\n01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000\nSo because I don't hit him\n\n01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000\nDo I just\n\n01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nFall away, like a trapeze\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000\nNo, because you're holding onto these chains\n\n01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000\nYou're like...\n\n01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000\nSo I just kind of like hang out there\n\n01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000\nLike that\n\n01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000\nFor the podcast listeners like\n\n01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000\nFlail\n\n01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000\nSo because I raped him\n\n01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000\nDoes that mean that, God\n\n01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000\nNo, it's unrelated, you just wanted to think about that\n\n01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000\nThat's what he thought of\n\n01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000\nIf he more resistant to me\n\n01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000\nDo you roll an emotional check?\n\n01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000\nNo, it just rolled a 2\n\n01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000\nIt happens\n\n01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000\nPutting in that sharp instance\n\n01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000\nWe have a history\n\n01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000\nI didn't know if he was like\n\n01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000\nThat's why I thought you were trying to make him think of stuff\n\n01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000\nBecause of your history\n\n01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000\nJust tell me when it's my turn\n\n01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000\nDid you?\n\n01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000\nThe last time you did that you then told Aaron it was her turn\n\n01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000\nThat's true\n\n01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000\nAnd you skipped me\n\n01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000\nI leave a basket\n\n01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000\nI hate all games\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000\nShocking grasp on this\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000\nMotherfucker\n\n01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000\nMotherfucker was weak\n\n01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000\nAnd petty\n\n01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000\nShocking grasp\n\n01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:50.000\nWith your arms crackling with electrical energy you grasp his neck and surging volts of electricity charge into his body\n\n01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000\nDealing\n\n01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000\nCatchphrase, do it\n\n01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000\nHe had to do your catchphrase\n\n01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000\nOh, I used to just lightening you\n\n01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000\nI hate you folks at home\n\n01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000\nMiss the lamest high five
