WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
What's the matter with your life? Why you gotta mess with mine?

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Don't keep sweating what I do cuz I'm gonna be just fine

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Check it out if I wanna take a guy

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Good evening!

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Harmontown is now in session

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Tonight it is my 40th birthday

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Join me in welcoming to the stage my old dear friend

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
The mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Hey you

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Guest Comptroller Erin McGathy is Jeff Davis tonight

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Hello

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
This Jeff Davis costume it involves so much more than the necessary

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
It's like there's a widow's peak you drew with a magic marker like he's Eddie Munster

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
And you seem to have like bronzer all over your face

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I do have bronzer all over my face

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Here's the thing, I'll address the widow's peak

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
I made a very elaborate cake of Jeff's face today

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
I carved his face out of Rice Krispie treats and covered it with fondant

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
And I discovered that he has a widow's peak because I was staring at pictures of him all day

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
By the way have you seen widow's peak with Julia Roberts and Kenneth Branagh?

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah, that's a fake movie right?

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
You're gonna have aliens in the movie in the last ten minutes

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Oh is that an actual movie?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
No, no

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
That's so good

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah, widow's peak, Kenneth Branagh

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
It's like a horror romantic cavity

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah, the poster is just a mountain and then two eyes above it

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
But then down at the bottom it's a shot of Kenneth Branagh and Julia Roberts kind of running

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Loneliness is deadliness

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Love is never receding

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
I mean it's not supposed to be a receding hairline, like he has a widow's peak which is a genetic

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Clap your hands if you have a widow's peak, it's a specific thing

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
You do sir, clap your hands

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
You too, clap your hands

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
It's not, a widow's peak is in, I remember in science in seventh grade science

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
We talked about a widow's peak, a widow's peak being a recessive gene

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
Anyway, the reason why I'm wearing bronzers is because I put this costume, I know this is shocking

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I put this costume together very quickly

02:35.000 --> 02:44.000
And when I put it on I, with this black hair I just reminded myself of me as like a fat 17 year old with black hair

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
And I put this on just so it didn't look like that anymore

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
You just started rubbing dirt on your face to escape

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
Yeah, I mean it's supposed to be contours, but really I was like, oh Jesus, no, what's going on?

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Alright, well it's a very special show because it's Jeff's birthday

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
It is Jeff's birthday

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
He's not here, so he wants, you know, he's celebrating his birthday elsewhere

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
But we're gonna, we're gonna

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Celebrate Jeff

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
We're gonna give him the gift slash passive aggressive taunt of having a great show for his birthday

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Back by popular demand, I want to bring him up right away

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Mr. Rob Schrab

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Popular

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Yeah man

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah, people on the reddit

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Popular demand

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
That they like, they like to

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
What, what did they say?

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
They like our, they like our timing together

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
You know, we've known each other a long time

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Right

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Say that again, say that again

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
What did they, what did they like about her?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
They like our timing

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Timing? Did they like that?

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
It seems like the audience has a really good mood tonight and I think I know why

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
We'll fix that real quick

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
They got to stay home and watch Breaking Bad and they got to miss two hours of me

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Apparently just suggesting pedophiles are great people

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I haven't listened to it

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
They're definitely nice

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
In true fashion, I kind of

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Hey, come over

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I always make about 85% of my points

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Have some Pepsi

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I actually saw it on the Harmontown subreddit

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
And this is a really fascinating, weird thing

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
There was an actual, I kind of, I haven't been going near it

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I've been so busy and I

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
You haven't been going near what?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
The legal

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
The Harmontown subreddit

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Because I didn't want to read a bunch of people saying like, what's your point?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Do you love pedophiles?

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
But I did notice a skimming that there was actually a self-identified

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
Pedophile that actually came forward, albeit anonymously, and said

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
You know, I don't have any control over what I am and stuff like that

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I just don't see

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
I'm not making any judgment one way or the other

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
However, I would say that my point that I was trying to make is that when we get, yeah

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
It's, oh god, whatever

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
This is an inappropriate question

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
But did that guy have a sense of humor about himself and if so, what was his handle?

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah, was it Adamantium?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
What was it? I mean, did it?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
I don't remember

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
I threw a now and then

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm sorry to jump, go ahead, I'm sorry, I didn't have anything anyway

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
That's really fast, I threw a now and then

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Your cake was great, by the way

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Thank you

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
I threw a now and then party a few weeks ago for some girlfriends

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
And now and then it was a movie that came out in 1995, yeah, woo

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
And so, in the spirit of that, I printed up a bunch of posters of heartthrobs from 1995

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
From when I was that old, which I guess was 11, when I was 11

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
And I felt like I printed them all out and didn't think about anything

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
Until I was taping up a picture of an eight-year-old Devin Sawa and overalls

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Around the house

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Just posters of prepubescent boys all over the house

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
And Dan and I have a really nice woman who comes over so often and cleans the house

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
She comes and cleans the house and I forgot to take down all these posters

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
So she walked into this room with just like little boys with overalls

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
And boys leaning up against brick walls, remember when that was a thing?

06:31.000 --> 06:40.000
Which she was able to add to her mental, sort of journal of our relationship

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
Before I was going out with Erin, when we were still platonic

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
And it was just you, me, and Jeff hanging out 24-7

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
And then, you know, you would crash at my place a lot, but then the nights that you would come over

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
You would put on this mustache that I had

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
Well, because Jeff put it on me a while, like before, put a, I mean, the dumb detail

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
And so you liked having the mustache on and doing bits

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
And, I mean, she really liked having the mustache on

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
And spirit glue, and it made her really happy

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
It's a good bit

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
And a happy woman is a sexy woman, so I was attracted to a mustachioed woman

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
So did you, okay, so is this leading to, like, after Jeff, like, why did you keep it on?

07:26.000 --> 07:34.000
Well, I just, like, my housekeeper, Sophia, like, one morning came in and we were

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Clean the room, all home

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
We had passed out in the living room and I just remember, like, me bolting up from the sofa

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
As Erin bolted up from elsewhere in the living room with this mustache on

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
We were in two different spots in the living room, both, like, sitting up, going, huh, huh

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
It's 8.30, and, like, she just, and then sometimes Sophia would find the mustache

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
Just laying around and she would carefully put in a little drawer

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
The drawer, it's important to note where the drawer was, which is next to the bed

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah, good, yeah

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
She knows

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
She always put it in the, in the little box next to the, next to the bed

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Did she clean it?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Did she clean it?

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
She combed it, she put it on a parchment paper

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Oh, it hates my life

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Oh, it's so bad

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Our next guest is the president of Mexico

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
He's a member of Mensa

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Shit, he's gonna

08:38.000 --> 08:45.000
He's been given a Nobel Prize recently for being a human being

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Dan and Rob, have either of you ever been to a baby shower?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Yeah, J.D. Riznar's

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah, we were at a, we were at a co-ed baby shower

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Yeah, we were at a co-ed baby shower

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
We found out why they don't invite men to those things

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah, because we went, what was it, like

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
They were just drunk and they were just shouting

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
We thought, I think, without even communicating, we were like ants, like

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
Communicating, like, this would be funny if we all got really like

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Bellicose

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
Jockey, like, the next time someone gives diapers, let's just hit the roof

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
It was just like, yeah man, right on

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
And just like, all the women were like

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
At that, it's traditional at baby showers to play little, little games

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
That go on throughout the night, were there any games at that baby shower?

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Is this leading to a game?

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
Tonight, tonight is Jeff Davis's 40th birthday

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
And if you listen to the podcast, you know that Jeff always looks at the clock

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
At exactly 9-11

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I've covered up the clock

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Genius

09:49.000 --> 10:00.000
Both of you, I've made a cake with a clock on the top that is, that read, that's at 9-11

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
And um

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
That was like a haiku

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Both of you, I made a cake

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Would you eat

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
It was at 9-11

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Do you eat the cake, or do you throw it away?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Is the rest of the a haiku, but I, that's it

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Oh, there's snow on the wind cell

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
What is it?

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
So both of you are going to pick, if you could really fast, pick a proxy who you're going to be playing for

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Because at 9-11, I have a clock in front of me

10:27.000 --> 10:34.000
When you think it's 9-11, the person who gets closest to the actual 9-11, your proxy will win a cake

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Oh, okay

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
So it's like, it's like playing for charity

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Well then I'll take Anatoly, he seems like really

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Wait, you're, what, you were pointing at Anatoly?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
We got the same kind of clock

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Oh, okay, alright

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
You're sitting right in front of me and you totally gained them from me

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Oh, there's a nice fellow over there

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Well, you're sitting next to Anatoly, did you come with him?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Yeah, man

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Would you consider yourself his nemesis?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Alright

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Like the American version of Anatoly

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
In a pre-Cold War, or pre-End of...

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
And interestingly enough, can actually, can Anatoly be Rav's proxy?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I'm sorry, what was...

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
What?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
They'll say Anatoly

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Oh, I see

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I'm sorry, what was your name again? We've met

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Kurt, I thought so, okay, hello

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
So Kurt, if you could, just really quick, you guys

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
It's the same color scheme

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Anatoly, if you could stand next to Robin

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Kurt, if you could stand next to Dan, really quick

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Just so you guys can see

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
See, I mean, come on

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
These are exact proxies

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Alright

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Alright, thank you fellas, sit down

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
He was gonna make me feel bad for picking the obvious choice

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
No hints from the audience

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Here's the rule, if you say it too soon

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Price or right, price is right

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I almost said price or right

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Price is right

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I hate playing games

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
I hate games

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
I hate games

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
I hate games

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
I've always hated games

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I hate them now more than ever

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
And I hate games

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
I hate sports and games

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Anything where there's a winner or a loser

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I absolutely hate

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
This is just a thing you're making me do

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Going on in the background

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Yeah, this is in the background

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
It's a game

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
The person who gets it

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Don't like it, never like games

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
If you guess before

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I hate games

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
If you guess before it's 9-11

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Then you're disqualified

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Closest person after

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
It's a game

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Let's continue

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And if you guess after

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
You lose

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
The quickest

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
The terrorist win

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Whatever

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Games, I hate them

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I hate that game, The War on Terror

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
There's a winner or a loser

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I do not like it

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
So you don't want us to fight

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
The War on Terror

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I don't want anybody to win or lose

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I just want us to all have a good time

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
And smoke a jay, man

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
We'll just sit back

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
And watch some fucking afternoon television

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
And just smoke a jay

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Why don't we all smoke jays

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Then we wouldn't be bombing so many people

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, hey man

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
If the government would just smoke a jay

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
It wouldn't be shut down, right?

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
How many days would you say you smoke daily?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
How many jays?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
How many jays?

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Man, I smoke a whole alphabet of jays

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
So one

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
So one jay

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
So one jay

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
So a whole alphabet worth of jays

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Maybe, okay

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Maybe an alphabet and a half

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Okay, if you stop after jay

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
I had a murder mystery birthday party

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Hate games

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I hated that game too, but it's over with

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Yes, well I had a murder mystery birthday party

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
And Rob was like, is it okay if I come a little late?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
I'm working

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
And he came just a little too late

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And got murdered immediately upon entering

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Like didn't have to play

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
And you know why?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
The whole time I'm like going

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
And I'm going to Harmon

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I said, I'm gonna show up

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
That's why I fucking hate games

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Is because I always

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Whether you're playing Werewolf

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Or Scrabble

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Or Sorry

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Or 9-Eleven Game

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Or whatever

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
It's like

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Alright, I'm gonna do it

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
And then

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
It's like out of the gate

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Okay, the first one to get

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Whether it's paintball or whatever

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
It's just like the first person to die

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
And sit in the corner and watch everybody

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Have a good time as me

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Alright, well speaking of games

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
I have a game

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Jesus!

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Robin, I came over here together

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
And I was

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I came with the cure, apparently

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
He jumped in the car and he was like

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Ah, this outfit

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
And then it wasn't until I looked in the mirror

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
And the bathroom here

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
I was like, oh my god, I look

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Like shit

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
I look terrible

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Alright

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I made up my mind

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
That we were gonna play D&D

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
For a really long time tonight

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
But even if we don't do that

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I at least want to get Spencer up here earlier than usual

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Let's bring up Spencer

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Here's another thing

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Welcome, welcome, Spencer

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Here's another thing I noticed

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Because I, of course

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
What's happening?

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Wait a minute, what?

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Really quick

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Was that my playoff music?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
No, I

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
I was talking to

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I accidentally updated my iPod

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
And my only playlist is

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
You have a giant iPod?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
No, it's just breaking bad music

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
And TLC right now

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
TLC, like left eye?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Yeah

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Like, what's a natural phenomenon

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
You shouldn't go after

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Waterfalls?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Yeah

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Is that right?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Yeah, that's right

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Are we playing a game right now?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Because I would pitch about it

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I do have a

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Because it is Jeff's 40th birthday

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I do have a Jeff

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
A Jeff game for the three of you to play

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Alright

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Oh, shit

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Is it like a five minute game or like

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
I don't know, 90 minutes

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
We don't have to play it if you don't want to

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Is it like questions about Jeff?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
No

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Yeah, that would be weird

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Are you going to

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
It would be like a three-way newlywed game

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Let me see if Spencer's a conversational goldmine

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Before we go into this game

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
I'd like to think so

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Spencer, I just heard about your parents' divorce

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
I'm sorry

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Yeah, whatever

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Maybe it's personal

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
He announced it

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Well, I only heard about it

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Because I just listened to the last week's show

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Before the show

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
I'm sorry

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Yeah, it was more a public concern

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Because it turns out it was Spencer's fault

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Yeah

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
I really screwed the pooch

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Did they try to abort you?

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
Yeah, and I've been turning them back ever since

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
How's your, uh, uh, uh...

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Dice

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
How's your...

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Well, let me tell you, Rob

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
This dice, I don't know

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
How's your job as my assistant going?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
It's so good, it's so great

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
It's, uh, the only thing I don't like

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Is that I feel like I'm worthless

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
And that I don't do my job right

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Because it's so easy

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Yeah, that's why

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
It's because a lot of it's just sitting down

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Why don't you clean my car?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Whenever you find yourself feeling like that

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Just go clean my car

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
This is the kind of dialogues that we need to have

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
This is the kind of dialogue I need to not have

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Because it makes me feel like an elitist prick

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Telling someone to clean his car

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I need you to go,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Shit, I got nothing to do

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Clean that motherfucker's car

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
There's a lot of Baja Fresh

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Wrappers in the back

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I should probably take care of those

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
My car gets really messy too

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I don't think about it

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Because I don't think about cleaning my car

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Rob, what were you doing an impression of?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Of me

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
That was Spencer

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Yeah

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Oh, check out all the Baja Fresh

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Wrappers in the back

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I should probably take care of these

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
And maybe get rid of them

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Is that like Thomas Hayden Church?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I'll have to get rid of these

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Baja Fresh Wrappers in the back

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
There's stuff like

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Two shoeboxes deep back

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
It's like, how is anybody supposed to sit back here?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Hey, can I ask you guys a question?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Sure, ask Spencer

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
It's about poop

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Is this about hot snakes?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Is that what you call poop?

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
I just learned about something called hot snakes today

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
It's apparently, it's a shape of poop, I guess

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I thought I might be lactose intolerant

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
And I brought it up to my friend Nolan

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
And he's like, you got hot snakes?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
And I'm like, what is, what?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
And he's like, you must not be

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
And I'm like, that doesn't mean any, you just said things

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
And then diagnosed me

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
I don't know

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Christopher Nolan?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
No, Nolan fabricated

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Nolan, stand up

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
What's up?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Nolan is wearing a

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
A jean jacket

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
And some table glasses

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
What's a hot snake?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
It's just the kind of poop you get

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
If you drink milk with weak stomach acid

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
It's like hot, it's hotter than redwood poop

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
And it's real

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I brought it up, I held it

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Alright, Nolan, get on the mic

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Come on down there

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
But isn't all, aren't all

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Poop snakes

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
And aren't they all hot?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Not because of

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Hey man, you haven't seen mine

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
This is why it's hard to explain

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
It's like, it's condescending, it's like

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
If you've been there, you know

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
No, snakes resonate

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
With anyone, please

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Defining poop is never condescending

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Bill, are you serious?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Dude, thanks man

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
It's important to note that

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Nolan is holding a bottle

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Of alcohol

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Yeah, also

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Also the Canadian tuxedo

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
What?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Double denims

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
So Dan, what is your poop question?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Okay, well I don't know if I want Nolan up here

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
When I do it

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Alright Nolan, go sit down

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Thank you Nolan, hot snakes

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Hot snakes

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
He seems like a good young man

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
You seem like you're rolling

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
With a good crowd

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Selling like hot snakes

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Wait, really quick

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Nolan, is that

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Your own term

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Or is that a common expression

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Hot snakes

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Me and my friends from where I'm from

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Just understood what it meant

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Alright Dan's poop question

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Mine doesn't have to do with

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
The actual content

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
It has to do with scheduling

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I've got an answer for this

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
For as long as I can remember

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
And this is not something

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
I'm complaining about at all

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I think this might be a superpower

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
That I have

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Every time that I eat

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I poop

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
That's good

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
That's great

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
I know it's not the food

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
That I just ate

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Because that's ridiculous

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
But it always seems like that

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
I have an English muffin

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
No, God no

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Not a half hour later

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
You're saying you're eating

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
You're not saying the obvious thing

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
That everything you eat you poop out

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
You're saying

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
That's the cartoon illusion that happens

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Because of what's happening

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I just have perfect synchronization

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I'm always filled with food

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
And then I put one

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Like meal

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
In my mouth

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
You're chewing your mouths

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
It's psychological

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Every time

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Your tongue tastes

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Like sugar and salt

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
It's like time to get it going

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Are you using the editorial you

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Or are you telling me how my

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
You Dan Harmon

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Me personally?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Other people are accused by

22:22.000 --> 22:30.000
Morey's on

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I don't really like

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Talking about my bathroom business

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
But

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
You like to let it do

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
It's talking for you

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I mean before I have

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
A big thing happening

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Shit coming out of your ass

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
When I started doing improv

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I got really

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Superstitious about

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Pooping before a show

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Because I would get nervous

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
And then have a great show

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Whether those two things

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Are related

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
It's just like

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Psychological

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
I think it's perfect to poop right as you eat

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I've always wanted to do that

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
It's like clockwork

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
You got garbage in, garbage out

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
It's on the cycle

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
It's synchronized

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I honestly wanted to do that

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Totally, totally

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Do you have any tips?

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I think I've just

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Wondered into some kind of perfect

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I just don't want to screw it up

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Spencer, what's your poop cue?

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
In the morning it sucks because

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I have to go pee in the morning

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
That happens to people

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
But I always have to

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Go pee and then go poop

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
But I only have to go poop like 50 minutes

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
After I go pee and it's like in the morning

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
So I got to get up to go to the bathroom twice

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
And that just kills any chance I have

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Of getting back to sleep in the morning

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Just resist it?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Nope

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Somebody asked me

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
A couple of weeks ago

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
What's some advice on directing

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
And I said

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Do a shot list whether you need it or not

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Your crew thinks you're working

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Always

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Talk to your actors

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
And the most important thing

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Take a shit

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Before you leave

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
The house in the morning

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Because shitting on set is like

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
The most disgusting thing in the world

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
It's terrible

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
So every morning before I go on set

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Like I'll

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I won't force myself to take a shit

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Because that sounds like it

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
But I mean my brain is

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Like

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
You gotta take a shit now

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Is needing to be on set

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Yeah, there is a definite like

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Scare if I for some reason

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Miss it like I get up super early

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
And I forget to shit like I'm driving

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I'll be panicking

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Because if I

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I have a love-hate relationship

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
With my ass

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I've talked about this before

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
On the show

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
And if I go to

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Number two

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I need to be clean

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
The rest of the day

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
So I'll jump in the shower usually

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
To clean it off

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
You can't do that when you're on set

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
He's obsessive about his butt

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Yeah

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Why did it get all real quiet

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
In here

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Is everybody leaning in

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Or leaning back

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I don't understand

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I've known about your anal obsession

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
For a while

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
It's not an anal obsession

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I like to be clean

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
But my question is like

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
When you clean yourself in the shower

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
And I've thought this before

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
And I've never had the gumption to ask you

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Do you bend over

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Like the copper tone girl

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Or what do you do

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
No, no, no, no, no

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
At one point I had the snake

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
The hot snake?

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Is that what you meant?

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I had the shower snake

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
And that got unhealthy

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
And you went to the doctor

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
And the doctor was like

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
What the fuck did you do to your ass

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
And I was like

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
I was like

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I'll call you about it

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
But you were flattered that he noticed

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
What do you mean

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
This whole thing

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I just threw this together

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
No big deal

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
When I was 10 years old

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
My family went camping in Alabama

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
And when you go

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
It was a campground where there was a shower

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
That was like a communal shower

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
And I was 9 or 10 years old

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
And I went

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
And I was taking a shower by myself

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Good

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
I was taking a shower by myself

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Granted, my uncle was there

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
And I was asked to pretend like I was surfing

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
But I was mostly by myself

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Thank you

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
It was a reference to

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
A smart guy

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
To the sitcom Smart Guy

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Where there was a pedophile episode

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
And he asked a kid to take his shirt off

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
And pretend like he was surfing

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
There was a different strokes pedophile episode

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
When I was your age

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
And it was Gordon Jump from WKRP

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Was the pedophile

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
And he took Dudley and Arnold into the bathroom

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
And they played Poseidon

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Neptune

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
The Kurt Russell one

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Kurt Russell

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
No, it was Gordon Jump

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I mean Poseidon

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Oh Jesus, curious you guys

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
I mean all I wanted to do was play D&D

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
So you went camping, I can't believe you're telling this story

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
This is amazing

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
I went camping

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
And I was in the shower

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
I was there by myself

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
And I had to poop very badly

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
And there was a drain there

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
And you know when you're a kid, maybe I was younger than 10

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Nope, no, it was certainly 10

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
And I saw the drain there

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I had to poop very badly

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
And I just didn't understand the physics of poop and a drain

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
And so I squatted down and pooped on the drain

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
And there was like a solid

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Poop

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Like a solid log on top of the drain

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Like a cold snake

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
You were hoping for a bunch of baby snakes

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
To come out and...

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I just thought it would wash away the same way that he did

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
In an ocean

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
But I pooped in the drain

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
And I finished my shower and wouldn't go away

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
And I was just like, I'll leave it there

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
It's fine

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
I went back to join my family

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
And a couple hours later

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
My mom and I are

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Doing something, we're making dinner

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
And she goes to the bathroom, she comes back

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Disgusted

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
And it's like, some animal

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Some monster

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Went and defecated

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
My mother was very waspy

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Defecated in the shower

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And didn't clean up after themselves

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
What animal?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Was going on and on about

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I don't know where they were raised

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
And where their values are

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
McGathey's

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
We would never

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
We would never

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
And I'm just sitting there like, baking or doing

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Not baking, on a cave site

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I'm sitting there fixing the television

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
I'm doing something

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
And I'm just listening to her go on and on

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
About how our family is better than other families

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Because

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
The guilt, just this weight

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
And when she was done, I was like, mom

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I was

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Me, I pooped

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I pooped in the shower

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I couldn't hold it

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
When you're young, you don't

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
That's actually a very interesting

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Reflex to that, yeah

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
You don't understand how things

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
You don't understand physics

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Because in your mind

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
You have a cartoon of it going

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
I pooped my pants when I was a kid

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
And I just took my underwear

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I knew I wasn't supposed to do it

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
I took my dirty underwear

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
And I opened the window to my bedroom

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
And I just threw them out

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Because I thought that outside

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Was like the garbage

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
And I thought the garbage was magic

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Probably

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Because you were walking around

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
And you were walking over from school

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
And you said, oh, there's a shoe there

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
There's a piece of

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
There's a sock there

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
And you go, well

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
My mom eventually goes like

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Did you poop your pants?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I'm like, no, absolutely not

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
It's on her head, like a hat

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
She was mowing the lawn

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Did you poop your pants?

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
She's holding a pair of hedge trimmers

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
And a grimace

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
And I put my ears like

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I'm Alec Baldwin in the hearing

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
In Malice, you know, I'm all cocky about it

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
No, I did not poop

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
God complex

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I'm God

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
A year later

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I was walking home from soccer practice

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
And I had like accidentally peed my pants before

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Just like every kid does

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
And I was

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
11 or 12

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Too old, walking home from soccer practice

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Walking with my neighbor

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
And like I had to pee really badly

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
And I was just wearing soccer shorts and a soccer jersey

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
And because like from experience

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Like, oh, if I pee a little on my pants

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
No one really knows

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
And I had to pee so bad

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I was like, I'll just let it go

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
And I just peed all over my shoes

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
You did a gesture

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
For the podcast

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Erin just did a gesture from her shoulder

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Yeah

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
I peed out of my neck

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
You guys peed out of your neck

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Like she's an Aunt Jemima bottle full of pee

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Wow

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I just emptied myself

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
That's a healthy pee

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
From the top of my spout toe

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
And a strong sweatshirt

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
But just with my

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
And I know that my friend and my neighbor noticed

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
But just like had the

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Like allowed

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Allow me to stay face enough to not mention it

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
But I peed all over my shorts

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
And on the ground there's a trail

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
There's a river behind me and she was just like

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
So are you watching Saved by the Bell later

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Or like what's going on

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Like just walking home with pee all over myself

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Then to that poop story is that my mom made me

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Go in and watch me clean it up

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Wow

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
RIP

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
I mean that's a pretty strong family

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
I mean I'm very impressed by

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Being 10 years old

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
And

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Having all of that pressure

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Actually to lie

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
The path of least resistance

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
There and also like actually

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
You knew you were going to really

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Disappoint your mom by telling her that

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
She was making it extra apparent

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
But you wanted to tell her out of guilt

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Which is really interesting

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Maybe your dad was a pastor

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
There's a different force there

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I know my parents

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
My mom would say

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Do I have to get out the Bible

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I wouldn't

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
It was a deal breaker for me

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
No matter how fucking cold to rights

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
I had my alibi

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
She had established

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
This concept that if you lie

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
When you put your hand on the Bible

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
You go to hell

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
And not only go to hell but my mom

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
She told me articles about

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
This is going to make my mom sound like some kind of

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Crazy character from Justified

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
I mean

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I take that back

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
She didn't show me articles

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
She told me about articles

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
She said in the news

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
There's this thing called spontaneous combustion

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Have you ever heard of that

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
People just walking down the street

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Why do you think that happens

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
I think we figured out later that spontaneous combustion

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Is people that fell asleep in a room

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
With a cigarette in their hand

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
There's a set of circumstances that causes the body

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
To not burst into flames

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
They call it spontaneous combustion

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Because you don't find the body until

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
It's basically smoldered

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
For a month

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
When you find it

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
It looks like someone

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
That just must have exploded into flames

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I don't think that's why they call it

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Spontaneous combustion though

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
What do you mean? It's because they

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Spontaneously burst into flames

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
That's what they think

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
It's like crib death

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
They call it spontaneous combustion

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Because you don't find them until a month later

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
That's not why

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
So are you talking to your parents about it

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
They call it spontaneous combustion

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Even though they never actually saw a person

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Spontaneously combust

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
What they would find is

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
These half chart carcasses

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
That when you look at the crime scene

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Or whatever it is

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
It looks like

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Spontaneous combustion occurred

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
It wasn't spontaneous

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
It was a slow rendering of body fat

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Over the course of a month

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
With no friends or no support system

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Isn't that like an industrial age

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Idea or like a post Edwardian

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Like it has to

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Was partnered with

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Just your mom calling it news

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
That's all I know she didn't say

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I know that in the Milwaukee Times

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
They didn't say

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
You don't have to

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Attack my mom

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
I peed my pants two years ago

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
This is another heroic story

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
This is about you taking back the night

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Because

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
All these stories about

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
This oppression

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Of like children

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
If you're caught peeing in your pants

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Like children are awful

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Like they'll go look at Ravi

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
He peed his pants

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
And the teachers are going

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
You peed your pants

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
You peed your pants man

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
You peed your pants man

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
You peed your pants man

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
What is Amerigo Vespucci do

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
No way you peed your pants

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
What is Susan Sarandon's say

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Susan Sarandon says

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
You peed your pants

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I don't know

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
What is Two-Face saying

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
You peed your

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Both of your pants

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Really quick, what does Spencer say

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Oh you peed your pants in the back

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
I better clean that out

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Get all these bell tacos out of here

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
That sounds kind of like

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
An American The Beatles

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Yeah

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
American The Beatles

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
They're from Statepool

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
No but I was

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Um

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
I live in London

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
You've been in a situation

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Where you're like

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
At Fox or you're on the other side

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
You're in Santa Monica

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Or something like that

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
And you leave a meeting and you're going

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Alright great talking to you

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Alright we'll see you later

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
And you go kind of go to the bathroom

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
I'll be fine

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
And I'll go to the bathroom when I get home

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
So I'm driving from

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Like

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Over by Santa

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
By Fox

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Driving down

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Olympic to get to

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Los Feliz where I live

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
And halfway there

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I go

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Shit

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
I have to pee

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
And it gets worse

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
And worse and I'm like

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
I'm doing the butt dance and the car

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Going oh god damn it

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Another red light and I just like

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Oh

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
And it's starting to hurt

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
And I'm crossing my legs

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
And I'm doing like the thigh slap

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
And I'm turning up the air

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Conditioner rolling up and down

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
The window

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Rolling them up and down

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I'm just keeping my mind and other stuff

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
And I'm just like

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Okay just hold on

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
All the tricks

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I get to

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I get to that place

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
On Virgil where it's like

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Next to the Kentucky Fried Chicken

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Or whatever and at one point I go

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
I could go to the Kentucky Fried Chicken

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
At this red light

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Run out, take a piss and come back

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
But for some reason

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
My brain thinking that there was like a toilet

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
It started going

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Time to open up the floodgates

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
And I go

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Crap and grab my crotch

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
And

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Kind of tap it off

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Like a tourniquet

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
And then everything else goes

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
All the way up to where my things

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
And I'm like okay well

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Wait like a snake spalling a mouse

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Like what do you mean?

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Okay

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
For those of us with a penis just

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Yeah

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
It's a hose

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Okay

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Pretend like it's a garden hose

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Water and the water's going up to the top

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
So it would resemble a snake

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Swallowing a mouse

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
It's throwing up a mouse

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
It's not swallowing anything

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I think the mouse is the penis she said

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
You'll have to forgive her she hasn't seen a penis in a month

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Alright

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Well anyway

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Most guys know when you do that

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
You're beyond the point of no return

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Because the minute you go like this

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
It's everywhere

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
And this was with the pants on

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
So it's like

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
I'm dead man walking right here

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Because

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Yeah I can drive home with one hand

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
But the minute I walk out of the car

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Next to the fucking Armenian people

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
That

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Live next door to be that hate me

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
And I hate them because they park me in

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
I'm gonna open up the door

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Holding my crotch

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Looking at them

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
They're looking at me with their fat ugly retarded kids

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
And just

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
I'm just gonna be like

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
And I should have done this

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Boom! This is what you wanted to see people

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Fireworks

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
I'm human

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
But I didn't give them the satisfaction

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
And I'm having like this

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Internal dialogue

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
The entire way home

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
And I'm like going

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I really screwed up this time

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Really having a bad like sweaty

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Really painful like I felt like

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
I'm doing some damage like

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Somebody's gonna blow up

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Somebody's gonna tell me

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
You know you really should have done that

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I always think about Abe Simpson and the Simpsons

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Like the episode where Homer

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Makes his dad hold his pee in the car

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
And his kidneys explode

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Yeah I feel like that

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I always imagine that in my head

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Yeah I feel like that you know I'm getting to that age

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
And I'm just driving along

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
And driving along at all these

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
American securities of like

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Oh Robby you peed your pants

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Or Robby you peed your pants

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Robby they're all

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Robby you peed your pants

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Robby you peed your pants

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Full score and seven years ago

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
You peed your pants

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
For some reason Wesley Snipes comes through

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Seeing from demolition man

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
He has pants and is like

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Always bet on Rob peeing his pants

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
And

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
And I

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Like just said to the universe

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
And I said you know something at the time

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I'm

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
39 years old

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
I'm an adult

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
I can do whatever the fuck I want

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
And I went boom

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
And I

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Pissed all over myself

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
And I said it's my car

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
My pants

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
My life

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
And I drove home with the

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Take that Obama

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
And

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
And

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
The music was cracked

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
And the very first thing I did

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
After I pissed my pants

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Like I put my headset on

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
And I called Ryan Ridley

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
And I go guess what I

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Just did

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
And I told him

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
The whole thing and he said

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
So badass man

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
He doesn't

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Agreed with me that's

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
That's what you get

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Heroes come in all sizes

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Let's play some D&D

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Yeah let's play

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Sorry that was long and forced in there

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
But I had to shit

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
And in answer to your question

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Why did they get quiet

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Audiences are conditioned when people start talking

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
About human shit

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
To expect a dramatic

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Evolution to happen

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Because it's always darkest before the dawn

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
They know from storytelling and their bones

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
They're literally talking

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
About fecal matter

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
So it can't get any worse

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Which means there's going to be some kind of bloom

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Of humanity, a triumph

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Unless Dino's here

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
In which case yeah there's more to go

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Yeah we could go deeper

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
I keep trying to get Dino down here

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
He won't get him down here

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Yeah it's hard to wrangle him

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
He keeps on peeing in the car on the way over

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
He's a free spirit

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
That was a one time thing

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
I feel like peeing my pants

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Not walking into a board room

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
And going hey how you doing

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Don't apologize to these 25 year olds

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
They don't know what it's like

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I'm apologizing to the would be

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Hierers

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
These guys are seven years past

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Just

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Not peeing their pants

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
For real

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
I think

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
What? Really?

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
They're that young

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Just give me a glow stick

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I'm going to rave

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
But you and I are in a new

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
We're Gandalf the White

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
We got killed by a ball rock

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
We don't give a fuck

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
That's how I felt like I felt like Gandalf

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
It was just like if I walked in

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
You know like

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
He just came in

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
And just piss everywhere

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
I felt the same way when I was walking home

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
From that soccer practice

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Like you felt like a hero

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Like a monster

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Trail of piss behind you

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Well my car was

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Were my shoes

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
My feet

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Let's play some D&D

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
What happened

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Somebody

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Ok

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Yes let's

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I don't but I can see the clock

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Now through the paper

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Stop looking at it

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I'm going to lose anyway

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Can I read

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Can we use this music for me to read one

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Reddit comment

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
That I got today in the community subreddit

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
In response to me talking about how

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
I don't like it

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
When people's

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Play the music again in a second

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
This is a comment in response to me

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Starting a thread where

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
I expressed the emotion

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I don't care about the debate

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I expressed the emotion

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Which made me feel a lot better

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
I'm in very good mood because I did this today

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
I expressed the fact that

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
When people blame season 4

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
On season 3 it makes me want to kill myself

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
It makes me want to barf

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
And die

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
It bums me out

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
It doesn't mean stop doing it

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
It doesn't mean you're wrong

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
It doesn't mean anything

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I just want to say

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
When I stumble into a Reddit thread

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Where somebody eventually brings up

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Well, if you think about it

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
The reason season 4 sucked

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Is because season 3 did this, this and that

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
What's the

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I mean

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I don't want to hash it out

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Because then it's misquoted

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Tomorrow in a thing

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
I just want to read this one

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
I quote this

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
I don't get it

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
And it's great

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
People shower me with praise and I'm not complaining about anything

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
I want to read this one comment

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
That I got in addition to all the amazing things

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
People say to me all the time online

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I have a great life, more than I deserve

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I have nothing to complain about

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
You are more than you deserve

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I'm not a martyr

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I don't have a bad life

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I'm rich and satisfied

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
And I do everything I want to do

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
But I think this is just a funny thing

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
That I received as a comment

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Amidst the other comments

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
So cue the music

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Shut up

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
You faggot

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
So wrong

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Your show is a worthless

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Oh sorry, I fucked it up

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Stand it over for the edit

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Stand it over for the other

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Dustin, it was for you

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
To sync the audio

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
For your feral audio

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
To sync the audio there

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
For your podcast

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
To sync the audio to the time track

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
So the tracks are timed

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Dustin, another person that hates my guts

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
On Instagram

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Alright, more on that

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
No, backstory, fuck it

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Alright

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Shut up, you faggot

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Your show is worthless

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
And so are you

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
If you weren't a worthless piece of shit

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
You could make good TV

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Like Breaking Bad

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
But you're worthless

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
So just wait until this season

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Lives up to nobody's expectations

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Fails to please the network

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Gets canned

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
And you kill yourself

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Fag

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
Well, it's over, that's it then

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Oh, okay

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Oh, it's a still photo? Okay

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Fag

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Ooh, I think I'll be using

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Mayfair on this one

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
Mayfair, definitely a Mayfair situation

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
What do you think that commenter

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
What do you think that commenter's definition

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Of fag is?

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Someone who won't read his pilot

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Let's play some D&D

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Here we go

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Dungeons & Dragons time

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Let's welcome to the

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Explaining

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Spencer

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Can you explain that?

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
I didn't know how to articulate

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Take it away, Spencer

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I guess the show said

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Take it away, Spencer

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
I think it's 9-11, right now

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
You're early, Rob Wins!

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Oh my God!

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I'm the smartest person on stage

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
I'm the smartest person on stage

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I'm the smartest person on stage

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
I'm the smartest person on stage

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
I'm the smartest person on stage

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
I'm the smartest person on stage

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Finally

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Anatoly, will you come to the stage really quick?

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Anatoly, while we're waiting for the cake

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Will you just list everything that you like

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Just words, not sentences

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Like, I like sugar

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
I eat sugar

49:28.000 --> 49:34.000
Just say words that you like

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Let's talk about the bow

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
It's right in my face

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
We're going to sing Happy Birthday

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
to Jeff Davis

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Who is

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
We are honoring tonight

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
By replacing him

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Who is dear to our hearts

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
And so wonderful

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
He was traveling a lot this month

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
So we...

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Whatever

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
He'll listen to this episode

50:00.000 --> 50:06.000
Happy Birthday to Jeff

50:06.000 --> 50:12.000
Happy Birthday to Jeff

50:12.000 --> 50:18.000
Happy Birthday dear Jeff

50:18.000 --> 50:34.000
Happy Birthday to you

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
By the way, I hate the Happy Birthday song

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Isn't it copyrighted?

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Like, are we in trouble?

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
What?

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Isn't it a copyrighted song?

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
No, you know what we can do

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
You know what I do

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Because I hate the Happy Birthday song

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Because I have a theory

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Nobody wants to sing it

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
And nobody wants to hear it

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Right?

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Everybody's just kind of sitting there

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Because it sounds like you're in church

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Right now

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
And then there's some idiot in the background

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Harmonizing

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
And you just say

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Boo

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Happy Birthday

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
to you

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Shoot that guy

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
What do we do?

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Kate and I's birthday

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
We sing Eddie Murphy

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
So we sing Eddie Murphy

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Can we do that real quick?

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
No, it's the same song

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
Eddie Murphy to you

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
It's the same song

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
Eddie Murphy to you

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
We're all smiling

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Eddie Murphy

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
to you

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
I mean

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Eddie Murphy

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
to you

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
So you love it

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
If you can put your stink on it

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
You're an artist

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
You demand cultural efficacy

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Nobody likes a Happy Birthday song

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Nobody likes hearing it

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
No one likes singing it

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
It's just one of these bullshit things

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
That we fucking do

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
And I know we're cutting into Dungeons & Dragons

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
It's fine

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
First of all, congrats on your win

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Second of all, I agree with you

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
I hate the Happy Birthday song

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
But what I hate more than the Happy Birthday song

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Is when you're Benny Hanna or wherever

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
And they have their own

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Happy Happy Birthday

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Pringles and a thing and a

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
We'll take it all up

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Do you like that?

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Happy Happy Birthday

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
He's just a control freak

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Let me ask you a question

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
He talks about winning and losing games

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
He's a control freak

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Where did you guys meet?

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
What was the first night that you met?

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
A control convention

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
He was running a panel

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
I like how you say

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Rob's a control freak

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
I didn't say I wasn't

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Dan Harmon said

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Rob's a control freak

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
How dare you

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Come on Harmontown

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I didn't say I wasn't

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
We did along because of it

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
I don't like

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
The Birthday song

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I don't like hearing it

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
On my birthday, I'm sitting there

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Everybody's looking at me singing this

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Funeral dirge of a song

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
That these two old

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Money-grubbing ladies

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Every time Jim Benny sings

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
We get 10%

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Oh

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Fuck you

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Do you remember the first moment that you saw Dan?

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Yes

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
I think I was

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
We were doing stand-up in

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
We were doing stand-up in Milwaukee

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
At the L.A. Freeway

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I've told this story too many times

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
And I was playing like make tracks

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Because I was nervous

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Because I was about to do stand-up for the first time

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
And I think

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
What is a make track?

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
It's a video game

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Coin-operated

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Video game

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
It was a third-tier

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Pac-Man rip-off

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
There was a barrel hoop and a stick

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
When you said make track

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
I thought that was an old one

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
I had a bowler hat on

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
I thought that was an antiquated term

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
For a mix tape

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
It was all sepia-toned

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I was like

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
I know what it was

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
I hope I can figure this out

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
He said it in my first impulse

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Imagine a 25-year-old Rob

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Touching

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Some kind of touch pad thing

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
On the bar of a thing

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
We didn't even have cell phones back then

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
In the movies

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
You knew someone was rich

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Because they would pull out a giant VHS cassette-sized phone

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
No one had cell phones

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
We were walking around a wasteland

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
People would walk up and they didn't have

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
A gallon of water

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Tied around their waist

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
We're on a Geiger counter

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
They'd be like

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
What's a little fall-out between friends?

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
I'm sorry, that's thunder-dome

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
I was going to say it sounds very post-apocalyptic

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
This is how old we are

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Because remember

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
When we were growing

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Back in the early 90s

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
This was another thing

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Like the cell phone

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
You knew somebody in a movie was a douche

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
With their car keys

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
And went

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Douchebag, how dare you

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Richie Rich

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Richie Rich with your

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Remote control car lock

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
What does that mean?

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
I remember when we got our first cell phones

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
And our phone numbers were one number apart

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Because Rob got them for both of us

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Because we had just become producers

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
On a TV pilot

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
And we needed our phones

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
We were the only people that didn't have phones

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
So Rob and Harvard, give me your numbers

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
So Rob, tell me about what you first

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
414

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
And I go, ooh, the Lovers Package

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Got that all the time

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Rob, when you first saw Dan, what was

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
It was, you know

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Kind of a Wingsworld

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Moment of

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Star Filters

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Did you see him on stage first or in person?

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Probably

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I remember seeing you

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
You did stand up before I did

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
You were 21

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Rob, what was Dan's

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Point of view at that time as a stand up?

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
You want to know what his act was like?

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Yeah, like I feel like

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
A very big fan of Jen Kirkman

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Who talks about not wanting to

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Yeah, Jen Kirkman's great

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
As an example, her point of view is that

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
She doesn't necessarily

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
She has this book

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Get to the Dungeons & Dragons

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Just quit looking at me for two seconds

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
So one of the

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Kirkman is independent

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
And open about her neuroses

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
And not wanting to have children

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
What was Dan Harmon's point of view at that time?

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Kind of

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
I only remember really titles of

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
I know my Closer was a wrap about

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Master Basics

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
So nothing has changed

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
A good 8 minutes of Jeffrey Dahmer jokes

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Who was eating people at the time

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
So it was a hot, funny topic

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Yeah

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
I got a story about that

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
When

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
You had like a bit about

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Like Johnny Carson

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Fucking Ed McMahon in the butt

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
This isn't going to make anyone happy

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Well my stand up was like

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Oh, what if Batman

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Was taking a shit when the bats came up

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I'm going to ask this question of both of you

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
You both are

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
What year is this?

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
92

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
No, it might have been 91

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Because I was turning

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
No, no, no

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
I was about to turn 92

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
And I

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
I was about to turn 22

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
And I wanted to be a stand up comedian

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
While I was 21

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Okay, it doesn't matter

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
You're both club promoters

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
In 1991

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
And neither of you

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Are comics, but you're familiar with the other person

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
You have like one

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
In the newspaper they're like

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Dan Harmon's come into the

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Bucket

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
How do we plug it, the show

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
What do you both say as club promoters

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
To promote the other person

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Knowing what you know about each other at the time

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
At the time

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Come see Dan Harmon

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Come see

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Nelly Furtado

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Is that your stage name?

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
No, I have this

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Playlist

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Come see Nelly Furtado

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
She sings about

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Freedom

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Yes, please don't

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
You don't have to say what audience

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
I can hear you

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
How do you

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
How do you promote the other person

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Come see

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Carrot Top

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
His props will bring you

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
To a grave of laughter

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Go easy on them folks

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
They're just starting out

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Yeah, there was a lot of that

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
There was a lot of that

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
But I want to know

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
There's a lot of that

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I would do stand up

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
And then the guy who was the emcee

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Give it up, comedy's hard guys

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Come on

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Come on, this isn't easy folks

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
What do you think you can do better

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
That was Rob Schrobblet, he's a gentleman

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Hard business

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
That's a given because you guys are starting out

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
And this is something I've asked you about before

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
And I can't get a straight answer

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
17 years old

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
But as an exercise

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
How do you

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
You're a club promoter

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Come see Rob Schrobb

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
No, you're describing

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Do you?

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Spencer, it's a hypothetical

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
She's trying to

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Figure out a way for us

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
To answer the question

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Can't hypothetical situations usually exist though?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
No, because they're hypothetical

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
They could, in theory, that's why

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
You do it, you don't do

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Hypothetically, what if an aided thing

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I guess

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
There's no need to shut down

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I think Dan knows what you're talking about

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Do you want this to be grounded or emotionally driven

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Do you mean

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Is there a difference?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
In the grounded version it would just be

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
No, I do not want it to be grounded

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I want to know what kind of comedy you were doing

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
At the time

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
But I want you to present it

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
As club promoter

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
It's not a crazy thing

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
You don't have to be defensive about it

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I'm being defensive towards Spencer

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Who last made sense that we were in

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Different generations

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Yeah, you are

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
You are

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
By five years

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Anyway

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
We're getting bogged down

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
We are

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I'm so sorry

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
That now I'm committing to this

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I'd really like to know

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
If I may, I think you're not

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Asking for a performance driven thing

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
You just want to know what it was like

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Give us some experience

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I assume that you guys were starting out

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
So you don't need to know that

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
It was amateur or whatever

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I just want to know what your point of view at the time was

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I just found out that Dan was making jokes

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
About Jeffrey Dahmer, which is really interesting

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
I'm just curious how you would plug the other person

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
If they were

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Here's the thing

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Famous comic

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
How do you plug that person?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
I fell in love with Dan Zack

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Before I fell in love with him

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Because he

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Would do what I liked

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Was talking about pop culture

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
And I was obsessed and still am with pop culture

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
So as a club promoter

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
What would you say?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Come see Dan Harmon

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:02.000
This is a newspaper

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
I don't know

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I think it's 9-11 again

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
But not on the clock

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
This is a rubble and corpse based

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Observation

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Um

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Dan Harmon's witty

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Observational humor

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
About oversized women

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Doing in the elevator

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
At college

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Remember that?

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Okay

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
See his

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Impressive impressions of

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
A big man

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Having sex with Johnny Carson

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Can you believe it?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Could you imagine

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It doesn't like the

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Zaps that are happening

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Next to it

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Can I tell you

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Two years for Schrabs

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I don't want to do the club promoter thing

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I just want to tell you my favorite

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Schrabs stand up thing

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Would you hear me and do the club promoter thing

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Before you explain the Schrabs

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Schrabs

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Come see a guy

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Who looks like a young version of Michael Stipe

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Doing a pussy in Batman jokes

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Okay

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
So

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
But Rob

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Did you do pussy tunes?

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I'm just having blown it through

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
You're right

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I probably did a lot of pussy

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Rob's opening thing

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
He would say

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
He would do an impression of

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
I don't know how you would tee it up

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
And he would go like

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
What if

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
What if Tonto

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
From Lone Ranger

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
And McCoy

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
From Star Trek

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Both ended up on a planet full of dead people

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
He would be Tonto going

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Him dead Kimosabe

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
He's dead Jim

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Him dead Kimosabe

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
He's dead Jim

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And then

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
And then there's a split screen

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
And it's just the two of them

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
And they're like

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Him dead Jim

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Kimosabe

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
He's dead Jim

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And then they were both crying

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Because they missed the Lone Ranger

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And Jim

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I forgot about the split screen

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
The split screen is the funny part

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Because it was stand up that had a split screen

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
That's what I was like

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
This guy

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
What was the fat woman

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
In the elevator joke

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Just a horrible

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Asperger child

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Thinking that

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
The reason not everyone did Andrew Day's Claes act

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Is because they were afraid to do it

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I did not understand comedy

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I was a terrible stand up

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Everyone here respects you

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I accept that

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
But

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I was doing terrible

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Marquette

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Was it Marquette that you kind of went to

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
And then left? Yes

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
So you got a Marquette and you're in the dorm

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
And I'm sitting there

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Do you want me to just

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
No I don't

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Because I'm embarrassed about it

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I'm embarrassed to say it

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I'm going to say instead of cunt

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
C-word

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Because I thought that was acceptable

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
To say

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
But even back then

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
In 1991

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
The whole room went

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
You don't say the c-word

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
In your stand up act

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Stop saying that word

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
It's the word

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
It was like

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I go to Marquette and I'm going to the dorm

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
And I get in the elevator

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
And I press one

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
And there's these fat c-words

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
That are there

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And they say

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Couldn't you take the stairs

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
And I go okay I'll get off

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
On 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
And take the stairs

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Bye

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
It was awful

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
No it didn't

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
No one laughed

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Everyone was sad for me

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
They could see from my acne that I was young enough

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
That it was weird that I was there

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
You were 17, 18

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I was not

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
18 and he was not 17

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I was 21

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
18 and I actually got him in trouble

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Because the woman that I was dating

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Was

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
The girl that I was dating

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
That was absolutely dating

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Five other guys

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
At the same time

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Was

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
She was a waitress at the bar

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
And we were living together at the time

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
When she was not having sex with everybody else

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
In the world

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
And I'm rolling over

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
You know

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Dan's funny right

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Yeah whatever

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
You know he's only 18

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
And he's so much funnier than me

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I just don't understand it

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
He's 18, I've been serving him drinks

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Shit

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Dan kicked out

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Of the bar

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Ended my burgeoning stand up correct

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
About fat cunts

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
That was our first

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
That was our first

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I was playing matrix

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
And I was worried

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Because I was about to do

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
My first stand up

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Open mic

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
And somebody told Dan

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
You came over

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And you said

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Hey brother

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Don't worry about it, it's gonna be fine

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
And walked away

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
And I felt like

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
You know it is gonna be fine

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
With this woman was it a secret

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
That she was dating other people

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
To me it was

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
But everybody else was fucking her

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Yeah

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Eventually I did

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
After I found out

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
She was having sex with everyone

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Yes

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Come on out Tammy

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
She's full of holes

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Come on guys

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
I'm not

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Crazy sociopath

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Awful person, terrible

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I gotcha

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
There must have been a moment between the two of you

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
That was like your big thawning moment

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Where you're sitting at the edge of a dock

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Throwing rocks into a river, what was your

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
It's a big, great world man

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
What was your thing?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
What was the moment that solidified your friendship?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I think it was a slow burn

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I think we were always

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Like

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
That was that party

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
The comedy sports party

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Like

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Somebody took me aside

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And gave me the don't get cocky speech

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Local impromptu

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Good thing to do for a

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
32 year old man to say to an 18 year old

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Hey, watch yourself

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
You're doing great

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Just don't make the mistake all the other greats

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Have been made, don't get cocky

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
You think you're gonna win the Wisconsin cheese

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Comic competition, you're not good enough for that

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
And then I was like

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I kind of ruined my evening

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
And I was driving home with Rob

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And I was like, man, bumped out

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
And he's like, why? I was like, hey

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
So-and-so took me aside

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
To the pickle pantry

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Told me not to get cocky

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
And Rob's like, what the fuck

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I just got told

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
By so-and-so not to get cocky

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
At the other party, man

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
And I was like, what the fuck

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Wait, this is a conspiracy

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
We're not cocky, they just don't want us to get cocky

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
And I was like, wait, wait

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
And I said, let's make a pact

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
If you get cocky, I'll tell you

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
I'll know

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
If I get cocky, you tell me

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
And until then, let's get fucking cocky

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Which leads us

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
To this intervention

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
That we all invited you to

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
This is a great show

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Dan, you're getting cocky

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Shit, god damn it

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I'm gonna throw it to Spencer

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Well, Brady Street, please come out

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Yeah, we're gonna talk to you

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Okay, you wanna edit that

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Alright, come on, let's

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Shit, man, fucked up

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Dungeons & Dragons

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Sorry

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I like talking about your friendship

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I really

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Everyone should really look up to this

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Friendship, they've worked together

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
And created so many things together

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
And been friends for so long

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
And it's really wonderful

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Dan performed Rob's wedding

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
That's true

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Dan married me

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Finally, after all these years

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Be wanting you to marry me

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
You finally married me

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
To my wife

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Any friendship is something to look up to

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
What?

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
You're gonna take that away from me?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
It's a sweet moment

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
And you went, I think that's bullshit

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
What?

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Maybe this is tainted by me being a navy kid

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Who moved around a lot

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
And you're looking fucking weird tonight

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I'm sorry

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
The shoulders

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Are what are bothering me

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
This is Dan's Emmy jacket

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
No, this is a different jacket

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
That's Zachary's jacket

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Did you guys see the way that I tie this tie?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
No, it's a podcast

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
You need some fog and tombstones

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Dungeons & Dragons

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I don't know

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Are we good?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Yeah, do it

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Okay

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Last time our heroes had found themselves

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
In a ruin full of stone lions

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And chains

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Sharpie climbed one and made everything

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Rumble for a while and everyone

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Fruck out and climbed on top of the lions

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Lava poured out of the mouth

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Of the lions

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Of the lions covered the hot

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
This is

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
You were in a fucking room

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Lava showed up

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
He climbed on top

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Of some statues

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And then you heard Admiral Darkstar

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
He's like

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
And then Robobreffy

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Showed up and he was like

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I'm Robobreffy

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
That's what happened

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
We're gonna have to bring

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
The lights way up

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Because I can't see shit

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
And I didn't bring my glasses

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
And that's not

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Goldier sucks

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Spencer Clinton everybody

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Alright, I don't want to derail

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Wait a minute, wait a minute

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I'm Kumail and Jeff

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
No, that shouldn't be

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
I'm just Kumail

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I'm Jeff

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Okay, I love it

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Is there something wrong?

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
No, I was Jeff

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Last time I was here, now I'm Kumail

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Okay, so

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I think Heroine's doing the heavy lifting

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I was

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I think Heroine's doing the heavy lifting

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
What is that? I don't know what that is

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
That's Kumail's stand-up bag

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
She's a friend of yours and you don't ever listen to his stuff

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I'm busy!

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
You're busy, you're busy

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I asked you, we're off a year

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
He's gonna be in next week's episode

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
He's gonna be

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
In a scene with Nathan Fillian

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Glad you saved that before my episode

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Which is the following week

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Applaud

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Strabs directing a couple of community episodes

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Alright, well we need

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
A young lady or an old lady

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
In the audience

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I sometimes say

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Well, anybody that feels like they deserve

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
To or would be healed

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
By participating

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
By playing Heroine's character

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
We got a hand up on the front row

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
What is your name young lady?

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
What's your name my friend?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Why do you want this so bad?

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I don't know, everyone was pointing at me in the front row

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
What is your name? You look like

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
You're a version of Alanis Morcette

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I'm going as Alanis Morcette for Halloween

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Oh nice, which version?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Her thank you video

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Oh yeah, I have like

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Tan tights and then like

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
I got hair extensions that are coming really long

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Did you just put that jacket on

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Or you've been wearing this the same time?

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Hold on

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
My name is Lea

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Lea

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Alright, thank you Lea

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Organa

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
What?

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
My name is

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
You wanted to come up here

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Kind of

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Alright

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Do you know

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Do you know what you're looking at?

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I think there's some screw ups here

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Oh no, that's good

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
You're good

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
It's a sheet of paper filled with things

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
That no one understands

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
And your name is Mulraine

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
You're sort of

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
A magical, nice

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
You have a lot of integrity

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
But also

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
You know, maybe you're sometimes

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Not very logical

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
You're a very optimistic person

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
You do have a box of

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Crafts and tools

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I know that I like putting on shows

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Yeah

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Alright

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
This is what I gotta do

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
To read this now

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Look at what I'm doing

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
He's holding it out very far

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Because we're old and our bodies are dying

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Alright, my birthday is next month

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Don't forget Dan

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Start

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
You know, good skimming

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Skimming Amazon

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Hey, hey, whoa

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
We do Wesley Snipes on my birthday

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
That's actually

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
A good idea, Wesley Snipes

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Wesley Snipes

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Day 2

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
I like Eddie Murphy

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Alright

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
So

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Where are we?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I already told you guys

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Where you are

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
That's cool

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Did we escape the lava?

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Okay, so currently

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
You guys are sitting on statues

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
That are kind of islands in this lava

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Is there a roof?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
The roof, as it happens

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Is on fire!

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Not quite

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
It's full of chains

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
It's like a jungle gym

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Of chains

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Right, and Brefie came crawling down

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Yeah, so he's in these chains above you

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Above your heads

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Question, are we in the middle of the room

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Or are we off to the side

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Of the room, or are we like

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Like one fourth of the way

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Yeah, you're about a quarter

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Into the room from the walls

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I get it, is there an opening

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
On

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Like if I, like Donkey Kong Jr.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Swung from the

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
The chains over

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
To

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Is there a place for me to go

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Is there a point A and B in this

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
You can kind of jump amongst these

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Chain, like, tangle of chains

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
That's all you can manage

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
The only way that was

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
The way in was a door

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
And that's covered in lava

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Are there any free-floating bunches of bananas

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Or oranges

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
That might be of value

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Nope, just chains

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
On the walls

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
And we were on top of these stone lions

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
When Brefie came down

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
So Brefie's down and he's mad

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Well, I mean, you don't know it's emotions

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
I'm about to find out

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Because they call me in this game

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
The great communicator

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Brefie

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
It's me, Sharpie

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Of the famous dirty

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Four

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Oh, okay

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I imagine you're angry with us

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
For destroying

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Your brethren

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
And then murdering you while Jeff

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Fucked you

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
If I'm getting that right

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
It was a weird night and

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
I think that's how it ended

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I tie the yarn

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
That I have around my head

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Like a bow so I seem less

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Intimidating

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
You seem less intimidating

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
But we have been through a lot

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Since then, as have you

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
And we

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Only ever

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Feel remorse when we

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Talk about what happened that night

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
And we

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Feel, although we're biased

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
That that's enough

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Destroy

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
You didn't let me finish

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Destroy

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Okay, if you're going to be rude

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
You're going to start

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
To put me in a social corner

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
And I think we need to start

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Yanking on these chains

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
I think we got to start pulling and yanking on chains

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Everybody grab it, even the women

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Just drag

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Yank on these chains

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
As hard as we can, we might open up a trap door

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
That's inverted and sneak out

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Or a thing

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
You know, just start yanking on the closest chain

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Everybody got a chain

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
I got two

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
You got a close chain

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
You can yank on because maybe

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I mean, there got to exist for some reason

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
So yank on a chain

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Somebody, anyone?

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Come on!

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
All right, we're, the both of us

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Are yanking on some chains

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
I don't see any chain yanking on your end of the line

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
I want to cast Mage Armor

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Okay

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
And yank on a chain

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Thank you

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
How are we doing over there, Quark?

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
You want to yank on a chain?

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Are you too awesome?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
No, I am certainly not too awesome

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I will

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
I'm going to, really quick

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And this is outside of the game

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
One of my special abilities says

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Eliterate?

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Yeah

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
It's a condition affecting

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Millions of Americans

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
You framed it as a special ability

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
For

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
The country's gotten that bad

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Hey man, I don't know what it says

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Just follow my heart, I don't know what that sign says

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
There's no handicap section

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
On the character sheets, you have to put it somewhere

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
One of my special abilities says

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guest star, come on

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
One of my special abilities says

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Cocoa exclamation point

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
That is a horse and your soulmate

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Yeah

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Get your horse to yank on a chain

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Also not a special

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
With his mouth

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Cocoa's not here

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I yank on a chain

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
You're all yanking on chains

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Yeah

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
They're just tangled up

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
And bolted to the walls

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
So it's like doing nothing

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Pretty much

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I jump down and I punch

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
You jump down into the lava?

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
No, I don't jump down into lava

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Then where do you jump down to?

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
To the top of one of the statues

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
You're on the statues

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
You're on the...

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Alright, how far away is Breffi?

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
He's up in this chains

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
He's about 30 feet off ahead of you

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
He's kind of in the middle of them

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Okay, I use my climbing ability

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
I tie one of my knives

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
To my head with my

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
With my yarn

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And I go up to him like a

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Like a norwhal

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
And I stab him in the face

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
What?

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Gary Guyjax just

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Cried out

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
In the audience

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
He rolled over in his dice

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Yeah

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
So leaping into the chains

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Try to remember that I have the skill of illiteracy

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Yeah

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Barbarians can't read, it's not a joke

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
They didn't learn

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
How to read

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Number one special ability is

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
They were too busy

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
You should also put a height

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
And literally it's a real rule

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
You have to

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I read a sign, no you don't

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
You're illiterate

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Also heights on there

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
So

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
I think our point is that if this game were

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Modern

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
It would have special disabilities on it

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Okay, so I'm norwhaling

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Breffi

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Can you edit out the 8 minute pause before

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
My lame joke

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Make it seem like that gem came right

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Out of my fucking idiot brain

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
It's your show man

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
I'm a barbarian

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I go in a barbarian mini rage

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
And I norwhal

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Breffi

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Okay, so rules wise is that a real rage or not a real rage

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
It's a real rage

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
So leaping into a rage

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
You climb through these things

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
And you get so crazy

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
You don't even know what you're doing

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
You're just headbutting a guy with a dagger in your face

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
It doesn't do any damage

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Because that's not how daggers should be

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Used

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
The universe says

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
This was the wrong use for the dagger

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
So gravity pulls it down, what do you mean?

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
No, how it works is if you were a trained warrior

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
For instance, who knew how to use a dagger

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
You would be a lot less

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Accurate with hitting something

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
If it were instead tied to your head

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Because

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
You're used to using with your arms

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Everyone knows where their head is

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
But it's not a warrior

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Technique

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
It's just flailing around

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Question

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
It's not as effective, so I mean I rolled it

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Can we do a kickstarter to fund

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
A pilot that's just Spencer and Aaron

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Driving

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And her just asking

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Questions about

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Dungeons and Dragons

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
What was your question Ron?

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
How long is my ribbon

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Rope? It only goes about 15 feet

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Don't try to use it creatively

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Just don't try to tie it to your body

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Why would you not tie it?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
People tie things to their bodies all the time

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
They really don't

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Okay, so

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
I'm thinking about doing some of the ribbon rope

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
But it depends on how

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
The lava is rising

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Right? Slowly

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Breffy is

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Where? He's up above you in this

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Web

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Trying to say a verse

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Yeah

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
I'm not complaining about this

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Because I like it, but you seem angry tonight

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
It's cool

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Is everyone kind of freaked out by me stabbing around

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
With my head? Like do I gain

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Some sort of intimidation points by acting

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Like a lunatic? No, he says

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
This is a guy who doesn't know how to use the weapons

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I see on his body

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Fair enough

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
He's got a flaming sword, he ties a dagger to his head

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Where am I?

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Am I on the same

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Lion?

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Am I on the same lion?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Am I on the same lion of them?

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
You're on separate lions

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Okay, I'm gonna start like shouting

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Really loud in a high pitched voice

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Okay, type casting

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Hey!

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Knock it off over there

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Bigger fish

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Nice

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Lava's getting

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Larger, right?

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Yeah

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
So, we gotta find a way out

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
I say we

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Give the pulling on the chains

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
One more try

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And then we'll call

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
We'll think of something else

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Because maybe we could

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Commit to it a little bit more

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
And not think it's a stupid idea

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
I think the attitude had a lot to do with it

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Not working

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I saw a lot of eye rolling

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
While they were pulling on chains

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Do I fit in my backpack?

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
I'm a halfling, do I fit in my backpack?

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Yeah, that's a fine question

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Halflings have like halfling size

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Backpacks, so unless it was like

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
A huge handy haversack

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
She could fit in one of our backpacks

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
She could fit in one normal size backpack

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Mulrainee, can I have your backpack?

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Or a bag of holding

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Okay, when do I get another turn?

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
It's like

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
I don't care if someone do something

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
I'm not gonna do anything until it's

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
My guy's turn

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
You don't have to be pouty

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
You control the universe

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Initiative, why don't you roll initiative?

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Roll some initiative

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
And then we can figure this out

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
There you go

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Dan, you go first

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Alright, here's what I would like to do

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
That's why you roll initiative

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
So this shit doesn't happen

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
So we can all stay friends

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
By the end of this

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
We got Jeff Davis' party to go to

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
It's a good point Rob, I should roll initiative

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
To keep things on track

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
That is true

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Teleport Cape

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Onto this fucking arachnid

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Assholes back

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Can I teleport onto his back?

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
You can definitely try

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
What's he doing on my back?

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
A different asshole

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
You teleport onto his back

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
You're up on it

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
You can see the back of his head

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000
It's all covered in metal plates

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I take my Norwell dagger

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
And I shamefully pull it off my head

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
I put it in my pocket

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
And I try to read something

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
And can't

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
What do you guys think of this drawing?

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Is this waves?

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
What does my sun rod do?

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
It's like a torch

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
What did you say?

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Shed's light

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Shed's light

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Like the sun

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
In a rod

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Yeah, you will

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
We're not fighting anything

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Technically, you are

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Speaking of which, I'm just going to go

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
He shoots chains at all of you guys

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Pull on him

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Everybody

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Pull on the chain

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Alright

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
He's not here

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Christopher

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Is there a hook on the end of the chain?

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Yeah, it stabs into your chest

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
And you feel it kind of grinding around

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Inside your body

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
You have

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
You take 8 damage

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
I have a spell

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Hope you're keeping track of that

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I don't got a pencil

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I have a spell called entangle

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
That sounds promising

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
How's that?

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Casting entangle

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
You try an entangle

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
You kind of try an entangle

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
But entangling doesn't happen

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
You see the chains, they start to shake

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
A little bit like they might move

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
But then they don't

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Sorry

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Just let me know when it's my turn

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
You can go

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I don't want to alarm anybody

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I don't want to alarm anybody

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I kind of start

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Starting to have to go to the bathroom

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I'm just like saying

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Well, just don't be a hero tonight

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I'm just saying, it's my life

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
And we're going to live it

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Okay

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
If it's my turn again, because Mulrainee and I

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Traded backpacks

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
And where I have the human backpack

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
I

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Spit on the backpack and I wrap

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
My cloak of resistance around the backpack

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
I poke two holes

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Through the bottom and the sides

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
And

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
I'm really saying I don't need the backpack

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
I wear

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
The cloak of resistance

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I have a wrap around me

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
With my flaming sword

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Rush breathy

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
With

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
The enthusiasm

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Of somebody who doesn't know

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
About the world, i.e. someone who

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Can't read

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I run, I run at him

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Use your far, far sword

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Thing

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I use my far sword thing

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Well, Spencer

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Hey, it's fine

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
You're already really close to him

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Because you wanted to headbutt him

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
When I say run, I mean

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
I use my flaming sword

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
And before

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
I stab him, I look in his eyes

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
And I say, think about

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Your most vulnerable time

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Have you ever peed in your pants

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Have you ever pooped in your pants

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
And maybe breathy

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Kind of thinks back

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
And that's when I stab him between his

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Eyes and I open my mouth

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
So I can drink his blood

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
So

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Say in those words, I'm clinging to the chains

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
You stab at him with your flaming sword

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
During his

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Moment of introspection

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
But you miss, apparently

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
It's pretty hard to cling to chains

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
While you're swiping with the sword, I guess

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
So he doesn't

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
It turns out the most vulnerable moment

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Was when you were raping him

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Just so you know

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000
DVD special features

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
So because I don't hit him

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Do I just

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Fall away, like a trapeze

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
No, because you're holding onto these chains

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
You're like...

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
So I just kind of like hang out there

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Like that

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
For the podcast listeners like

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Flail

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
So because I raped him

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Does that mean that, God

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
No, it's unrelated, you just wanted to think about that

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
That's what he thought of

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
If he more resistant to me

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Do you roll an emotional check?

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
No, it just rolled a 2

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
It happens

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Putting in that sharp instance

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
We have a history

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
I didn't know if he was like

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
That's why I thought you were trying to make him think of stuff

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Because of your history

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Just tell me when it's my turn

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Did you?

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
The last time you did that you then told Aaron it was her turn

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
That's true

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
And you skipped me

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I leave a basket

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
I hate all games

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Shocking grasp on this

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Motherfucker

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Motherfucker was weak

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
And petty

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Shocking grasp

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:50.000
With your arms crackling with electrical energy you grasp his neck and surging volts of electricity charge into his body

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Dealing

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Catchphrase, do it

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
He had to do your catchphrase

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Oh, I used to just lightening you

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000
I hate you folks at home

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Miss the lamest high five in the world

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Dealing

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
21 damage

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
21

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
It's throat to rob

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
All right

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I hope that guy got a call

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
I hope that guy got a call

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000
It's throat to rob

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
I hope that guy got a call

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I was 21

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I was so wrong

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000
I'm going to ask a question on behalf of our guest star

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Oh, come on

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
No, no, no, I'm giving it up

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
I'm here all the time

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Twice

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Who are the chains around?

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.780
They're just kind of hanging hanging the ceiling like rafters like you climb around. Yeah, but the change got shot at me at one point

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:06.160
What are those changes they get retract stomach? They're stuck in my stomach. Yeah, don't don't heat the chains

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:14.520
She's taken I have a cell that heat up metal, but he don't understand what the change don't heat up the chains

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:18.800
They're still in my esophagus. That's wrong and give them a hot snake

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:20.800
Um

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:28.480
Okay, I'm gonna take my round back if that's okay

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:39.560
Shit man, I mean can I grab the chains that and I have strength of

01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:42.480
13

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.880
I'm gonna try yanking him in

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:49.880
And go you want to do this

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:54.560
You want to do this and I'm pulling them in and I'm just it hurts

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.880
I

01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:00.760
Mean the chains in my stomach hurt it hurts. I'm not saying it doesn't hurt

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:06.720
And it's not bleeding, but I'm like, you know gritting my teeth and I'm going you want this

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.400
Kind of hand over hand

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:14.400
Pulling him closer to me. I might even do one of those wrapping around my forearm

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:20.840
Like an extension cord kind of a thing with the chain. You know what I'm talking about AB club

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:22.840
Let's do this and like

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:27.400
Closer as he's as I'm pulling him closer. My eyes are getting wider

01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:33.080
And I'm like going I'm not gonna stop pulling these chains closer

01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:37.440
Until where nose to nose and then I'm gonna do some

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:39.440
yellow

01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:41.920
Post-it notes shit on you

01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:50.280
Okay, so so you know I mean come on you can roll it and everything but that rolled it pretty cool to not

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:52.820
Allow me to do it's a really great thing

01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:55.320
But I and I as quark and I'm very

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:59.920
Moved by what you're doing and I want to capture my feelings so I spit on a piece of paper. I

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:06.440
Don't allow that that grossness to affect my pulling

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:12.120
So I just like I grip my teeth even harder. There's a lot heavier than you so like the end result

01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:14.360
You're just kind of like pulling yourself towards him

01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:22.240
I'll take it. Yeah, I'll take it. I'll take it. Can we can we can we cliffhanger with us nose-to-nose?

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:34.240
Do it back what I

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:36.240
I missed that whole thing

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:42.640
You I pulled myself closer to him and we're nose-to-nose and we're growling at each other like

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:45.320
Well, you're growling

01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:47.880
Feel like I got a growl back a robot

01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:57.040
All right, just want to put mescaline in our vodka tonight. All right, so all right and say one last thing

01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:03.800
Coco the horse. Yeah, all right
