alright that's great I hope you guys know that that that's about taking a shit and and peeing

02:13.400 --> 02:19.280
and stuff I feel like just having done that 20 seconds of podcasts we've made up for last week

02:19.280 --> 02:24.920
certainly certainly a little more mainstream accessible than the last hour or so of last

02:24.920 --> 02:30.280
week hey man weekly podcast off the top of our head unedited take the good with the bad and fuck

02:30.280 --> 02:40.600
off alright so let's see my garage stinks I need glasses I'd like to commit a hundred percent to

02:40.600 --> 02:48.960
D&D tonight I'm wondering about premium gas I've been thinking about like what has the species

02:48.960 --> 02:54.200
accomplished other than things relative to the species I'd like to know how Spencer's enjoying

02:54.200 --> 02:59.400
being my assistant seek Donnelly's here tonight our annuals annualism surviving friend would like

02:59.400 --> 03:05.760
to speak with us for a little bit I had an emotional memory about brown deer Wisconsin

03:05.760 --> 03:13.800
on the 4th of July that made me sad tonight and I'd like to talk about to Spencer about possible

03:13.800 --> 03:19.800
improvements to my pad of paper device because it must be said to the home listener that you

03:19.800 --> 03:24.240
are not reading it's so much more efficient than reading off your phone you're reading off of the

03:24.240 --> 03:29.440
eye Harmon yeah chest notes well listen listen to how much shit just tonight I this is one page from

03:29.440 --> 03:38.480
tonight I used this thing while driving over here that is still illegal I'm sure it is but I mean

03:38.480 --> 03:44.240
every everything's being humans illegal I mean that's actually more dangerous than texting because

03:44.240 --> 03:50.800
that must take two hands to do that no no less like Aaron was driving with me you can ask her

03:50.800 --> 03:56.880
I with this you can just around my back committed aggravated vehicular man manslaughter I'm not

03:56.880 --> 04:03.280
gonna defend any of my behavior I just but I will tell you that this is this was safer while

04:03.280 --> 04:07.720
driving than than texting none of which is safe you shouldn't be doing anything but drive while

04:07.720 --> 04:16.120
you're driving and and loving all races and sexual orientations and and and invading Syria

04:16.120 --> 04:24.000
all right just just some things to knock out Dan how do you feel about Syria you know I we got

04:24.000 --> 04:28.840
to get in there and see what's what's going on just you know right now it's like Schrodinger's

04:28.840 --> 04:33.520
country I mean is there are they a threat or not there's only one way to find out open the

04:33.520 --> 04:41.160
box I don't I don't know man but but if they are Schrodinger's country and we open it up and

04:41.160 --> 04:48.760
they're not a threat you know the witch sunk you know the old the old witch thing you know you

04:48.760 --> 04:54.360
throw the lady in the water okay she floats she's a witch if she sank but shit they don't

04:54.360 --> 05:00.360
think they don't sink we just drown right yeah I think I think I think if you look up drowning

05:00.360 --> 05:06.840
in the dictionary it will say like sinking as a human you know human bodies float after they

05:06.840 --> 05:13.320
after they drown because they fill up with gas oh boy I think I think for the part that's killing

05:13.320 --> 05:18.960
you you're underwater otherwise otherwise you're not a witch because you sink to the bottom of

05:18.960 --> 05:24.120
the lake no that's if you're not a witch you drown right that was the whole point of that yeah

05:24.120 --> 05:33.480
like what I okay here's the thing that I wanted to talk to you about because you had a list I

05:33.480 --> 05:38.640
have my favorite thing to start with but you once you fit what I want to go right into your

05:38.640 --> 05:49.360
problem with premium gas I don't have a problem I have a question is it is it am I should I be

05:49.360 --> 05:55.560
getting premium gas is there any is it just a scam for just rich people is it do you own or

05:55.560 --> 06:09.960
lease your car I own it then buy premium gas it makes your engine better it's like Sesame Street

06:09.960 --> 06:15.240
in here but you know it but more but instead of talking about the harm return audiences is asked

06:15.240 --> 06:22.000
to fight it as Congress is about Syria right how many aren't decided on Syria and on premium gas

06:22.000 --> 06:32.600
right now I think there's probably a stone that could kill both of those birds or a missile

06:32.600 --> 06:40.560
yeah yeah who considers himself a sort of expert on this issue like mechanics on a gasoline

06:40.560 --> 06:46.760
whatever about the premium gas thing that's Syria okay nobody no well do we have a Syria

06:46.760 --> 06:53.200
okay I got a hand shooting up in the middle are you sort of a gas gas would you be willing to

06:53.200 --> 07:05.600
come up here for just a moment okay premium gas segment this is the premium gas segment you

07:05.600 --> 07:10.920
can grab one of those mics what's your name sir I'm Gabe Gabe all right thank you for joining us

07:10.920 --> 07:17.280
here at the Harmontown meeting so what did you learn about premium gas so I learned that my car

07:17.280 --> 07:21.440
takes premium gas and I have to put it in or something goes wrong with my car what kind of

07:21.440 --> 07:28.760
car do you have I have an Acura it's an old Acura and you and really it needs premium gas so if it

07:28.760 --> 07:34.560
says requires premium then you have to put it in if they say recommends premium then you can put a

07:34.560 --> 07:41.040
lower octane in and it still works like the engine will adjust to it all right so I have I have a

07:41.040 --> 07:47.240
Prius does it say it requires premium I didn't look it up it probably doesn't right no so you

07:47.240 --> 07:51.080
don't need to put in premium all right it's like the engine is tuned for whatever octane that they

07:51.080 --> 07:55.760
say I think the big selling point was you barely need to put in any gas it's got a big battery in

07:55.760 --> 08:01.600
it I mean putting any gas in it you have to put in gas some yeah I mean yeah always there has to be

08:01.600 --> 08:05.920
some gas so some in there it gets alarmed when there's not in there yeah aren't you gonna get a

08:05.920 --> 08:10.960
Tesla at some point I look at the Tesla is like I think it's like 500 grand and there's a waiting

08:10.960 --> 08:16.720
list I can't 60 grand 60 grand yeah there's models that there's levels of Tesla well I don't want the

08:16.720 --> 08:24.880
Tesla coach the Tesla economy because like a little a little golf cart but it's technically a

08:24.880 --> 08:29.760
Tesla 60 or 80 depending on how much you spend all right well so I say I have to research it more

08:29.760 --> 08:37.920
if it's if it's under a hundred grand like I might celebrate like the no no no I'm no if it's if

08:37.920 --> 08:42.720
it's under a hundred and yeah no I would I would I would think about it again because I've had my

08:42.720 --> 08:47.080
I've had my car for a long time this is taking this is taking a horrible direction premium gas is

08:47.080 --> 08:50.240
something that everyone can relate to listening to me talk about what car I want to buy next is

08:50.240 --> 08:55.920
that's that's bad entertainment all right well thank you Gabe you want to plug your new book

08:55.920 --> 09:03.280
it's your book I'm reading your book okay all right your book all right the game everybody

09:03.280 --> 09:14.440
gas knowledge Gabe gas gas Dave premium premium Gabe all right boy I hit you with a tornado of

09:14.440 --> 09:21.400
topics and you just latched onto the worst like the most mundane it's funny when you get attached

09:21.400 --> 09:27.080
to the mundane because you live in a rarefied realm of craziness that when you get bogged down

09:27.080 --> 09:32.240
with you know plumbing or that your gas that's funny here's the thing I'd like to talk to you

09:32.240 --> 09:37.400
about and I'd like to workshop this idea with you can we talk about the fact that backstage

09:37.400 --> 09:42.840
right before we came on and we don't talk about a lot before the show starts Dan was singing the

09:42.840 --> 09:48.440
milk milk lemonade yeah and he said Jeff what is the chain what was your question there what's

09:48.440 --> 09:52.360
the button what's the button the push the button pull the chain I know the chains your dick someone

09:52.360 --> 09:57.600
else asked what the chain is yeah Spencer asked what the belly button is your button and Spencer said

09:57.600 --> 10:02.800
what's the chain is your dick right now I think Aaron said what's the chain oh yeah maybe it's

10:02.800 --> 10:08.000
Spencer Spencer I thought that I thought the button might have been a nipple but then when you

10:08.000 --> 10:14.080
said it was your belly button that made more sense because that might make me poop pushing pushing the

10:14.080 --> 10:20.000
belly button and then pulling my dick like because that's never happened before whereas lots of

10:20.000 --> 10:25.600
people have touched my nipple with it you prefer to your penis as a little purple choo choo train

10:25.600 --> 10:39.600
before oh yeah well all aboard I'm not all one at one at a time no I want to talk to you Jeff

10:39.600 --> 10:47.520
about okay so you know okay so I was in bed today all day with my lover Erin McGathy like not

10:47.520 --> 10:51.920
doing anything sexy or anything like doing something that we love to do which is sit and

10:51.920 --> 10:58.840
watch movies and eat pizza that might embarrass her because she would rather you think that we

10:58.840 --> 11:04.400
were sitting in bed lifting weights or something but or making love well she would probably love

11:04.400 --> 11:09.320
for you to think that too yeah I've been I don't need you to have that mental image I'd rather you

11:09.320 --> 11:13.760
see me like like sitting in bed with one of those like back pillow I was watching you guys eat

11:13.760 --> 11:21.160
pizza in bed fuck yeah yeah it's the best relationship ever and love that is something

11:21.160 --> 11:25.760
I've never done I've never had a pizza a while in bed oh man I've never eaten a pizza supine

11:25.760 --> 11:32.480
before welcome welcome to every Sunday hit at Dan adieu yeah we just we see we wake up and then

11:32.480 --> 11:39.120
we roll over and grab the remote and there's a there's a flat panel on the wall and then you

11:39.120 --> 11:45.120
just like go to the Apple TV I mean this is just unrepentant and do you grab hub who gets out of

11:45.120 --> 11:50.280
she gets she she grubs the hub yeah the grub 24 the she who gets out of bed to actually get the

11:50.280 --> 11:55.880
pizza from the front door or just the grub hub gentlemen come in and get in bed with you there's

11:55.880 --> 12:03.160
an extra pillow for him and he has to watch die hard too with you whoever whoever's got pajama

12:03.160 --> 12:08.600
bottoms on at the time there's a negotiation you know people get each other water aspirin things

12:08.600 --> 12:15.040
so anyway so Aaron gets it so no I usually I usually do the hunting and gathering thank you

12:15.040 --> 12:24.560
the I was thinking neither hunting nor gathering it's all relative to a sedentary lifestyle like

12:24.560 --> 12:28.920
that is the most hunting and gathering that's gonna get done this way I'm surprised you even

12:28.920 --> 12:33.280
have the energy and the fortitude to put your little eye harmin around your neck in the morning

12:33.280 --> 12:41.120
and I like that to me seems like a physical exertion for you yeah it's not easy so I was

12:41.120 --> 12:48.840
getting out of bed today to come to do the show yes that's how long we we stayed in bed we had a

12:48.840 --> 12:55.640
perfect Sunday we watched some Ryan Gosling crap and ate some pizza and there is no such thing as

12:55.640 --> 13:06.400
Ryan Gosling crap so some movie about him where he says very little has lazy eyes and drives a

13:06.400 --> 13:14.960
vehicle to to moody needle drops and I just described for Ryan Gosling that's that's the only

13:14.960 --> 13:20.760
three I've seen yeah I could narrow it down by tattoos I could go like oh it's the one where

13:20.760 --> 13:28.600
the hamburgers on his bicep so but I could not narrow it down by saying it's the one that

13:28.600 --> 13:36.840
dissolves to like synth music as he proceeds to down an autumn an autumn leaf festooned

13:36.840 --> 13:42.720
country highway that's that that's you still got three movies to guess from that all right

13:42.720 --> 13:50.760
shut up getting getting out of bed to come to the show I was I was overcome with the sensation

13:50.760 --> 13:54.320
that I'm sure we've all had which is that I would rather stay in bed not no offense to these

13:54.320 --> 13:58.400
people or the show like I'm glad I'm here now because I get to talk about this but I was thinking

13:58.400 --> 14:05.760
on the drive here and wrote down in my pad while going 40 miles an hour down sunset that like okay

14:05.760 --> 14:10.280
so and please workshop this with me I'm not presenting this as a thing that I know is gonna

14:10.280 --> 14:15.400
work and I don't want I don't want all your little hole pokers coming out and poking holes in this I

14:15.400 --> 14:22.160
want you to build something with me it's called brainstorming it's called yes and work on this

14:22.160 --> 14:27.280
with me it's not it's not gonna sound foolproof immediately it's not gonna it's gonna gonna

14:27.280 --> 14:33.680
nestle perfectly within our our society but it might be something build society around so do you

14:33.680 --> 14:43.120
know how the Amish have that what do they call it ramen sprung and things yes you know Google it

14:43.120 --> 14:50.440
I'm sure you know they they're they're Amish and then like on there you know when they become

14:50.440 --> 14:58.040
adolescent Amish people and then the Amish Hive says to them like go go be not Amish for summer

14:58.040 --> 15:03.880
it doesn't matter I don't care but they have it today I'm not saying that I don't know anything

15:03.880 --> 15:07.880
about it I don't care I just know that they go off and they be not Amish for a while it's their

15:07.880 --> 15:12.320
chance to decide whether they want to come back into the fold did you become Amish in the drive

15:12.320 --> 15:17.840
here just thinking about that in relation to my bed experience where I don't I didn't I wanted to

15:17.840 --> 15:27.920
I wanted to stay in bed so so I don't know like working title bed bed sprung in okay it's like I'm

15:27.920 --> 15:35.360
riffing here like help me workshop it I don't I'm just bad pitch and let's build on this once a month

15:35.360 --> 15:42.200
the the the the worker at Harmontown they're the average citizen whoever you are there's no

15:42.200 --> 15:49.160
hierarchies the person a Harmontown citizen you you're in bed and you you have to stay in bed

15:49.160 --> 16:04.120
until you can't stand being in bed anymore that's it that's called depression staying in bed is

16:04.120 --> 16:10.320
called depression getting out of bed is called enthusiasm that's called recovery yeah and it's

16:10.320 --> 16:15.280
good yes it's it's also called rebirth and recalibration of your of your mind and spirit like

16:15.280 --> 16:20.680
you're going I'm getting out of bed for a reason and so I'm always how we all are always getting

16:20.680 --> 16:26.520
out of bed against our most fervent wishes usually how many how often are you leaping out of bed

16:26.520 --> 16:31.480
for me when it rains when it's raining outside I love I can't wait to be out in the rain my

16:31.480 --> 16:37.080
girlfriend hates the rain because she's Scottish we have like we're totally different she'd rather

16:37.080 --> 16:43.960
never go outside when it rains for me I've heard pitterpats of rain I must be outside yeah okay

16:43.960 --> 16:55.040
I said I'm saying there are instances when it's good to be out of bed yeah yeah yeah I was just

16:55.040 --> 16:59.000
proposing this idea Jeff that people have to stay in bed why don't we why don't they realize

16:59.000 --> 17:02.400
that they want to get out of bed why don't you it would be when it started to rain why don't

17:02.400 --> 17:06.440
you make community so successful that we can build a bedroom big enough that we could do

17:06.440 --> 17:15.480
Harmontown in your bedroom each audience member could have a bed now you're talking about a cult

17:15.480 --> 17:25.680
but yeah well you know the difference between a cult and a society is you know longevity

17:25.680 --> 17:34.840
solvency success you know talk to you about a 200 year old cult called America that worked out

17:34.840 --> 17:44.680
just fine until recently all right so I mean obviously you're not gonna help me work make

17:44.680 --> 17:53.240
that idea work and we'll get back to us in 200 years what are we gonna do for Halloween look last

17:53.240 --> 18:01.520
year we all dressed up as Jareth from labyrinth I spent a lot of money on that costume I'm coming

18:01.520 --> 18:08.600
as Jareth again all right I mean unless look Halloween is one of those three four day long

18:08.600 --> 18:13.200
like experiences where you can dress up as a cowboy one night and a sexy fireman the other night

18:13.200 --> 18:17.480
and then like and then we can all dress up as whatever but I'm one of those nights I'm fucking

18:17.480 --> 18:24.920
Jareth again don't you think it's nice when we all at Harmontown dress as something all

18:24.920 --> 18:32.800
David Bowie different Bowie like a different what's your pitch my pitch my pitch is all

18:32.800 --> 18:42.280
Spencer's I don't like that because you said that in front of Spencer Spencer didn't look

18:42.280 --> 18:46.320
pleased about that here's some other things Spencer doesn't look pleased when you say

18:46.320 --> 18:57.760
Spencer is not just pleased by everything Spencer doesn't need a bunch of people to come in at

18:57.760 --> 19:02.880
Beards and lumberjack shirts and shorts I'm not doing it for him I know that's why it's a bad idea

19:02.880 --> 19:12.480
so we should not do things that one person is gonna be upset dressing like a person that is not

19:12.480 --> 19:21.200
a an actual iconic figure if we leave here if we leave the sexy confines of meltdown and we go

19:21.200 --> 19:26.160
out to a bar afterwards we're dressed as Spencer we just look like like people in bad Beards and

19:26.160 --> 19:31.320
ponytails and then that doesn't doesn't resonate anymore and my concern is that two things one

19:31.320 --> 19:36.120
Spencer doesn't like the fact that we're all either paying tribute or mocking him in some way

19:36.120 --> 19:41.840
and the second thing we go somewhere else and we look homeless I mean that's kind of a yeah

19:41.840 --> 19:50.680
pretty like one-two backhanded kidney punch the quality of Spencer's beard you cannot get at a

19:50.680 --> 19:55.360
beard store there's no such thing as a place you're gonna get as a shitty fucking Hollywood

19:55.360 --> 20:03.200
Boulevard Hammurabi looking shitty beard and you cannot get a wig as sexy as his long metal hair

20:03.200 --> 20:09.920
that he's neatly confined into a into a mysterious ponytail then you got to get the right glasses and

20:09.920 --> 20:16.240
then nobody really has this build and so like what it's just gonna look like bad mimicry which I

20:16.240 --> 20:23.000
think doesn't do anybody any service all right so your pitch is just to do Jareth again no no I'm

20:23.000 --> 20:27.920
saying I'd be ever paying something else I don't think we should we should all mimic one of our

20:27.920 --> 20:33.160
friends that wouldn't resonate to the rest of the world also hard to look like Spencer you have a

20:33.160 --> 20:37.080
fucking like you're closer because you already have kind of a beard and like you don't have a

20:37.080 --> 20:41.040
Spencer beard but you what's the end game with the rest of the world we're gonna you like the idea

20:41.040 --> 20:44.960
of going to a bar and having everyone go why are you all Mickey Mouse and we go weird because

20:44.960 --> 20:50.560
we're friends let's say we're gonna be here we're gonna be here for two hours then we're gonna

20:50.560 --> 20:54.600
probably want to go somewhere else and we're gonna have to explain everybody oh we're that guy

20:54.600 --> 21:06.280
and he's gonna go hmm I don't care that happened who knows man the whole night is gonna be on him

21:06.280 --> 21:12.320
to deal with why we all dressed like him it's gonna I think would be embarrassing for Spencer

21:12.320 --> 21:19.560
okay so what is it about Spencer is it about the reaction of the bartender first and foremost or

21:19.560 --> 21:24.080
is it about accuracy of costume or is it because you think Spencer looks homeless no those are

21:24.080 --> 21:28.240
those have been thrown out I'm picturing my best attempt at looking like Spencer and I'm gonna

21:28.240 --> 21:33.160
look like a shitty Spencer and that's not gonna nobody wins at that point all right first and

21:33.160 --> 21:37.800
foremost I think Spencer is the concern and then not because he gives a shit but I think that

21:37.800 --> 21:44.440
that's a burden okay all right this has been great the the it's automatically entertaining for

21:44.440 --> 21:50.120
was one person suggest something the other person says no like it's a this is a half hour of this

21:50.120 --> 21:56.280
so far I think it's a bad idea okay all right and tell me why you think it's a good idea I think

21:56.280 --> 22:06.360
it's a good idea because I'll take 10 what I don't what are you doing right now what are you

22:06.360 --> 22:14.760
I'm joking you're what I mean what I'm what I'm suggesting to you is that you're absolutely no value

22:14.760 --> 22:20.160
add to you explaining why something shouldn't be done and you also didn't have a very good first

22:20.160 --> 22:25.200
pitch which was the idea of recycling your expensive Halloween that was also a joke I'm

22:25.200 --> 22:30.240
out of laziness I would do that but let's think of another one I don't I you don't get a second

22:30.240 --> 22:35.200
motion from for the Spencer thing from me I mean does anybody else that I want everyone do we all

22:35.200 --> 22:43.000
want to come and spend no no no we're moving on all right that's 15 minutes of someone saying no

22:43.000 --> 22:49.560
to somebody about something it's that's the long enough I got another hour and a half of me all

22:49.560 --> 22:53.760
right my garage smells like mildew and we'll save that for next week let's put let's put that down

22:53.760 --> 22:56.360
on the road I'm gonna ask for some volunteers we're gonna go in there and clean it up that's

22:56.360 --> 23:02.800
I think I may need glasses I had to skip an optometry appointment I'm 40 years old I think

23:02.800 --> 23:07.440
it's just come become that time for me to have glasses I'm afraid I don't know I was looking at

23:07.440 --> 23:14.280
the billboards coming in here I can't tell a Vince Vaughn from a grand theft auto character

23:14.280 --> 23:20.720
anymore you are holding your eye harm in closer and closer yeah yeah it's a thing I don't know

23:20.720 --> 23:26.840
yeah so we got which is a new segment new segment tonight tell me what kind of music

23:26.840 --> 23:31.680
theme you think you want something downbeat funky old school something do you have something

23:31.680 --> 23:41.040
provincial so I can find out what that word means when I hear it I'll pick a province and

23:41.040 --> 23:46.600
I'll go with it this segment is called Erin McGathy asks questions about the grand theft

23:46.600 --> 23:56.680
auto 5 billboard

23:56.680 --> 24:10.080
so we were driving down sunset and you saw a big a big billboard for grand theft auto 5

24:10.080 --> 24:15.200
which is coming out this month yeah and you had some questions about the about it about the

24:15.200 --> 24:21.560
billboard yeah who is that guy he's just a guy that you can play in grand theft auto 5 I'm

24:21.560 --> 24:26.120
assuming okay is he a special guy because he's just wearing a polo shirt he's just a guy he's

24:26.120 --> 24:30.720
one he's a guy that you'll be able to play in grand theft auto 5 he's not currently famous

24:30.720 --> 24:35.000
within the grand theft auto universe so then why is he on the advertisement why am I driving down

24:35.000 --> 24:41.520
the street and I see a giant guy because Christian Bale isn't in the game and it's just a they're

24:41.520 --> 24:46.920
just in the grand theft auto 5 audience is built in and so they're just reminding you oh this huge

24:46.920 --> 24:51.200
video game is coming out with a new release and here's our stylistic kind of is he supposed to

24:51.200 --> 24:57.720
be a real person I'm really distracted by Tyler raising his hands we're actually just repeating

24:57.720 --> 25:02.400
our conversation from before yeah this is yeah I mean there's no I don't know what you you know

25:02.400 --> 25:12.400
you just want to raise your hand now they're doing their conversation again full boy you guys are the worst

25:12.400 --> 25:23.200
I wish the segment is the best day of my life Aaron's Aaron's questions about the grand theft

25:23.200 --> 25:28.080
auto billboard yeah and just to let you guys behind the curtain a little bit we have this

25:28.080 --> 25:32.880
conversation so that's the bit okay so all right but it's not a not that I ever stopped it with

25:32.880 --> 25:37.520
this is the best conversation of the world we should have it again I just wanted you to ask

25:37.520 --> 25:43.960
your questions okay okay so here are my real questions um so okay sorry now I'm in my head

25:43.960 --> 25:49.480
um but these I'm gonna think about the actual way that I feel about this billboard so he's

25:49.480 --> 25:54.560
just holding a bunch of money it's grand theft auto 5 right yeah I don't know why I said it said it

25:54.560 --> 26:00.520
that way grand theft auto 5 um it's grand theft auto 5 so when it why is there not like a special

26:00.520 --> 26:05.480
character on the billboard why is the billboard just like my dentist he's a guy that likes to

26:05.480 --> 26:11.320
steal cars put your hand down Tyler it doesn't don't you understand the question her the answers

26:11.320 --> 26:17.280
don't matter no they're not they're not rhetorical but the answers don't matter this is what she

26:17.280 --> 26:22.720
doesn't understand is that grand theft auto 5 could put a fucking turd on a billboard and say

26:22.720 --> 26:27.280
remember to buy grand theft auto 5 and I keep explaining that to her it doesn't matter like

26:27.280 --> 26:32.080
when the Batman 9 movie comes out they're not gonna they don't they don't go like all right make

26:32.080 --> 26:38.280
sure that we show Batman doing something awesome but he's definitely like in a shadow or he's at

26:38.280 --> 26:42.160
least wearing his bat outfit just to let you know that there's a Batman movie that's all they care

26:42.160 --> 26:46.720
about okay so Tyler this is a real question about grand theft auto um so that man in the

26:46.720 --> 26:57.200
polo he's a man we know but he's not he's he's not a man we know okay exactly so he's just a

26:57.200 --> 27:12.640
man wearing a polo shirt okay so so so Laura's Lauren someone just called her racist for saying

27:12.640 --> 27:19.680
that he looks like all the characters in the game okay so is the idea that it's like oh yeah

27:19.680 --> 27:26.080
they're back at it again we have a white man in a polo shirt yeah my favorite video game company

27:26.080 --> 27:31.960
is making my favorite video game again yeah it's like like yeah it's like a guy just any guy like

27:31.960 --> 27:37.720
it might have been a woman in a bikini like well what I was saying earlier is like you like I would

27:37.720 --> 27:43.880
all I mean even though it's it's it's so misogynist I was like where are the girls and the with the

27:43.880 --> 27:49.240
giant crazy pumpkin breasts like why why is it just this man and this polo shirt holding a bunch of

27:49.240 --> 27:52.760
cash I've never played the game but from what I know they're probably being raped by a car right

27:52.760 --> 27:58.440
yeah exactly so which is why people play that game right or no I know that's not why you play

27:58.440 --> 28:04.320
the game by the way you guys are I feel like you guys are being really mean or weird or not not

28:04.320 --> 28:18.880
mean not mean I mean all right look look there's only one way to resolve this I feel silly about

28:18.880 --> 28:24.280
this now we have to have a new segment called Tyler's answers about Grand Theft Auto he's

28:24.280 --> 28:31.160
gonna he's going to explode okay well then I and I have actual questions I have actual questions

28:31.160 --> 28:37.680
okay so in every Grand Theft Auto game is it always just it's just a generic looking man with

28:37.680 --> 28:41.560
a polo shirt there's a new protagonist in every game and that's not what I asked in the other games

28:41.560 --> 28:47.600
like is it is it just always men and polos no okay what are the men what are the heroes usually

28:47.600 --> 28:53.880
in Grant in the previous one it was a guy from the Eastern block his name was Nico okay he kind

28:53.880 --> 28:59.160
of played an immigrant you were new to America he was in New York he was kind of trying to leave

28:59.160 --> 29:02.680
his old life behind but it caught up with him and he did that again so is the pure purpose of

29:02.680 --> 29:08.040
the bulbar to be like we're back to a white guy like honestly don't know the purpose of back to

29:08.040 --> 29:12.720
what are they pulling back from like a special there's three guys in the new game there's dude

29:12.720 --> 29:18.360
in polo shirt there's a dude coming out of the hood trying to leave the old hood mentality behind

29:18.360 --> 29:24.040
crazy guy who is kind of a psychopath there's the three things and they're like let's all get

29:24.040 --> 29:27.960
together and do heists that's the that's the point behind the new one do you how do they know each

29:27.960 --> 29:33.960
other I don't know what I'm playing the game you seem to know a lot about this from the marketing

29:33.960 --> 29:37.960
material they Aaron are you asking these questions because you want to get into Grand Theft Auto

29:37.960 --> 29:42.000
is this anything or are you just you're pretty I mean I'm pretty sure Grand Theft Auto would

29:42.000 --> 29:47.800
make me cry it's really it's I know I don't want to get it's not that bad well I mean I don't like

29:47.800 --> 29:58.000
fevery okay well that is a big part of the grand theft auto-games yes stealing I respect other people's property you know like

29:58.000 --> 30:05.560
I don't like running over people well I mean with each new release there are more and more non-criminal

30:05.560 --> 30:10.960
elements you could focus on you can go to a bowling alley that's what I was asking before like him

30:10.960 --> 30:14.560
just holding the cash if I didn't know what it was I'd be like oh this guy just got back from the

30:14.560 --> 30:22.240
bank oh man he's going to apply for his mother's loan what you seriously you're like you look at the

30:22.240 --> 30:27.160
billboard like oh man that guy went to chase and withdrew $2,000 you know what is he doing is he buying

30:27.160 --> 30:35.720
a pool not seriously what not literally I'm just literally the way that it so okay so more more

30:35.720 --> 30:40.400
questions have there ever been has there ever been like a and I'm not saying this defensively

30:40.400 --> 30:45.440
but has there ever been a female like marauder there has never been a female protagonist in a

30:45.440 --> 30:52.280
grand theft auto or any game by the people who made that game no okay okay um so so these polo

30:52.280 --> 31:00.520
people no they actually had actual polo players where there was like guys that were like playing

31:00.520 --> 31:14.400
games to the one that came out where we had the guy in New York they were kind of time pieces so

31:14.400 --> 31:19.080
like you had one that was set in the 80s and one that was set in the 90s so they were kind of

31:19.080 --> 31:22.960
different characters now they've kind of gone like genre you totally there were genre pieces like

31:22.960 --> 31:29.680
this is an 80s film but there's never gonna be one in 19th century England picture good Jane

31:29.680 --> 31:38.160
Austin you're not on the agenda why don't you step outside and let me take this guy if you

31:38.160 --> 31:45.520
guys play great grand theft handsome cab yeah so is the idea do you think the idea of the game is

31:45.520 --> 31:52.040
that the these men are normal men because you're like oh I could be I could I could be the thief

31:52.040 --> 32:00.080
maybe what's the word I'm looking for it but the car stealers their word for that criminal thief well

32:00.080 --> 32:07.000
I didn't know if there was like burglar or I don't know whatever dumb question I think as I think as

32:07.000 --> 32:13.280
technology increases and these computer systems have more memory and hard drive space and the

32:13.280 --> 32:19.960
chips are faster blah blah blah the more they allow for simulation of reality the easiest

32:19.960 --> 32:26.920
way to celebrate that newfound power is to sort of deconstruct not so much reality like I which I

32:26.920 --> 32:32.840
think that violent video games are mistaken for like oh let's let's take reality and do horrible

32:32.840 --> 32:36.320
violent fantasies with them I think it's more deconstruction of what you've previously been

32:36.320 --> 32:43.760
able to do within video games like I grew up on pole position where you just like if you go off

32:43.760 --> 32:48.840
the road your car turns into eight more pixels and you're told that you you lost and so the

32:48.840 --> 32:54.440
exhilarating power of being able to hit the F key and get out of your car run over to another one

32:54.440 --> 32:59.280
hit the F key again at which point your character opens that guy's car door pulls him out punches him

32:59.280 --> 33:03.360
in the face throws him away and gets in that car that's like it's not so much like I always wished

33:03.360 --> 33:08.560
I could do that it's like I always I was I'm so glad this video game is allowing me to see more of

33:08.560 --> 33:20.760
the world and I gotta say I'm not trying to score points here but I have a I like I am very

33:20.760 --> 33:26.440
handicapped in these games by my absolute like I have a very difficult time crossing the threshold

33:26.440 --> 33:30.720
rate where like people are being victimized like like even though they're kind of like randomly

33:30.720 --> 33:36.960
generated like people thanks baby there's always comes a point when you do cross that

33:36.960 --> 33:40.600
threshold on accident like you've just sort of someone gets in the way and you hit him with a

33:40.600 --> 33:47.400
bat and then and then you're like oh I'm fine and then it starts to become it's like by the time

33:47.400 --> 33:51.240
you're done playing those games you're kind of like exploring every horrible masochistic I don't

33:51.240 --> 33:55.320
have flashbacks when I play Grand Theft Auto like oh man I shouldn't have clubbed that hooker I don't

33:55.320 --> 34:19.320
know if there's not anything more pressing we got other segments to cover is that okay yeah you

34:19.320 --> 34:24.960
think you got it under control now any other really pressing questions about the billboard

34:24.960 --> 34:28.560
nothing Aaron are you just like is there a concern in your mind that you're gonna lose

34:28.560 --> 34:33.320
Dan to this game that you don't understand like like no no that won't happen I can't I can't go

34:33.320 --> 34:38.160
near this thing until December then we're going to Scotland I can't I'm not gonna I'm gonna miss

34:38.160 --> 34:43.200
out on Grand Theft Auto 5 it'll be there when you get back down you know you could I'll dress up

34:43.200 --> 34:49.640
like like a lady of the night I'll make you a little card can I give you can I give you five

34:49.640 --> 34:55.840
five weird catchphrases to just say what are the catch what are the catchphrases looking good sugar

34:55.840 --> 35:08.440
what's happening that boy be trippin hey hey you want a party and stop stealing that car for a

35:08.440 --> 35:15.840
short time I was a for a summer in LA I was a tutor for kids in the eighth grade who are wanting

35:15.840 --> 35:21.080
to get into private high schools and English tutor and the kid that I was that I was tutoring

35:21.080 --> 35:25.920
or supposed to tutor he got to have like a video game break and would just go and play Grand Theft

35:25.920 --> 35:34.800
Auto and just drive over people and he was a really shitty shitty shitty kid and that sounds

35:34.800 --> 35:39.120
like a one-to-one correlation you're like oh if you're driving over kids and grab that thought it

35:39.120 --> 35:44.760
wasn't his fault that he was a shitty kid his he his his dad owned Jeopardy and a million other

35:44.760 --> 35:55.360
things he lives in and I was griffin what you tutor Ted Griffin Damian Griffin that's a weird

35:55.360 --> 36:01.880
correlation I'm not has nothing to do with Jeopardy I'm just saying that he comes from a family with

36:01.880 --> 36:07.240
a bazillion dollars and his parents don't pay attention to him he has a personal chef and

36:07.240 --> 36:14.240
someone who teaches him and history is any teacher being born rich will make you shittier

36:14.240 --> 36:19.520
before video games do that's for sure nothing to do with rich people for a long time and a healthy

36:19.520 --> 36:23.840
history shitty people and then video games just came along recently it's just something for shitty

36:23.840 --> 36:31.800
people to do along with good people Grand Theft Auto he'd be raping a lot of people he'd also already

36:31.800 --> 36:37.000
bet there's nothing to do with video games he he was sad because his parents wouldn't hug him and

36:37.000 --> 36:41.160
they lived in the same house but wouldn't come to his wing of the house that's how crazy you

36:41.160 --> 36:48.080
said Mervyn Linda Griffin would not it all started when when he finally got tired of his Richard

36:48.080 --> 36:56.760
Pryor in a plastic ball he did literally what does anyone know the name of that Japanese artist who

36:56.760 --> 37:01.000
would make those big sculptures of like plush sculptures and sometimes it would be like a man

37:01.000 --> 37:09.960
coming on himself or like sometimes it would be what I expected a lot of people but I don't know

37:09.960 --> 37:27.680
how common you think your Google alerts are anyway but anyway it doesn't matter what I'm saying is

37:27.680 --> 37:32.560
there's this fine artist that was in town he had a giant sculpture by this artist in his room he just

37:32.560 --> 37:38.760
had a lot of money and he was so sad because his parents literally would not speak to him and he

37:38.760 --> 37:43.240
became like such a shitty sad kid they would only they would only let him talk in the form of a

37:43.240 --> 38:04.320
question oh sorry why don't you love me what is I have to make poopies when I say when I say owned

38:04.320 --> 38:09.960
jeopardy I mean owned the company that owns jeopardy and whatever the more specific you get the

38:09.960 --> 38:16.480
more we have to delete out of this brother we make it unless we have to cut out of the show the

38:16.480 --> 38:20.840
point is that this is not a comment on Grand Theft Auto at all I don't think it's I don't think that

38:20.840 --> 38:25.840
makes people bad and all that he would he would play it just to run over people like in his head

38:25.840 --> 38:29.800

requested to come up tonight you wanted to pay us a visit yeah actually well I've been

41:18.200 --> 41:22.520
feeling good lately so I wanted to come up when I had more energy than I did last time

41:22.520 --> 41:29.320
I came up but I kind of wanted to ask a question of the audience all right who the fuck do

41:29.320 --> 41:34.640
you think you are and then he just throws down the mic and flies through the roof

41:34.640 --> 41:44.960
holy shit he was a superhero the whole time we were warned over and over again you fucking

41:44.960 --> 41:51.640
people treat me like shit I could bend Jupiter with my mind goodbye and then you just hear

41:51.640 --> 41:57.240
him as his voice trails off into the transfer he goes code seven to proceed with the demolition

41:57.240 --> 42:03.480
then the last thing we remember is the or the ground turning orange all right sorry what

42:03.480 --> 42:10.120

42:10.120 --> 42:15.120
actual thunder there I was gonna do all of that yeah he's gonna wait he's gonna wait

42:15.120 --> 42:25.000
one more week I'll come back sevens off my own special way I'm a savior of humanity no

42:25.000 --> 42:30.960
I've as some of you been seeing on Twitter I spent the last six weeks although I will

42:30.960 --> 42:36.240
admit I cheated and started before I was on the last episode but I've been drawing people

42:36.240 --> 42:43.320
from Harmontown as a Mega Man characters yeah I saw some of which is my favorite video game

42:43.320 --> 42:49.240
you know take that Grand Theft Auto and yeah and and it's one of the few like really vivid

42:49.240 --> 42:55.120
childhood memories I have not very not not the visuals of it but just I remember always

42:55.120 --> 43:00.240
being obsessed about it I think to the point where one day my mom my mom raised me and

43:00.240 --> 43:04.440
my brother by herself and she went on a date one night and then she came home at two in

43:04.440 --> 43:09.080
the morning and my brother was asleep and I turned my entire room into a level from

43:09.080 --> 43:16.680
Mega Man and she she was mad and my brother was asleep and I'm like jumping on the beds

43:16.680 --> 43:20.760
like shooting like at things at the wall that aren't moving what turning your room into

43:20.760 --> 43:27.840
any level from any video game and entail some tidiness like I miss Mega Man I'm a little

43:27.840 --> 43:33.080
older than you it's like it's like Mario it's like side scroll and I guess so yeah there's

43:33.080 --> 43:38.440
just blocks floating in my room you made your room two-dimensional yes that's against a

43:38.440 --> 43:45.280
lot of building codes yeah so we didn't get the deposit back on the apartment but so I've

43:45.280 --> 43:49.560
been drawing people like and I didn't want to just draw you guys like I drew because

43:49.560 --> 43:54.400
this show is you guys have all kind of whether you know it or not have kind of become like

43:54.400 --> 43:59.600
an extended family of mine and so I wanted to draw some of you too so I drew NT and

43:59.600 --> 44:04.720
Adam Goldberg and then I drew some of your guests I drew Dustin obviously and I spent

44:04.720 --> 44:12.480
a lot of times had two nosebleeds and one blackout no seizures but I spent about seven

44:12.480 --> 44:17.600
weeks drawing all of these so I guess I was just curious if people were interested I was

44:17.600 --> 44:21.320
thinking about making prints and I ran the idea by Dan maybe make a very limited number

44:21.320 --> 44:25.520
of the prints and we could sell them here like before a show one night I don't know maybe

44:25.520 --> 44:34.560
two nosebleeds that's why if you look on Twitter I tweeted the original pictures and then

44:34.560 --> 44:38.160
later you see them on completely different paper and it's because I had it I had to use

44:38.160 --> 44:42.840
a lightbox to redraw it because I bled on the previous I mean that's not because of

44:42.840 --> 44:49.360
the art right like it's because it's the amount of it takes to create something visual for

44:49.360 --> 44:56.960
me it takes a lot Adam well Jesus God I mean well that's I mean thank you I'm not saying

44:56.960 --> 45:01.040
I would normally bleed for Harmontown I'm just it just happened I wasn't expecting it

45:01.040 --> 45:05.280
it just happened what so what so what do we what do I have to pull the trigger on how

45:05.280 --> 45:10.560
do we get how do we you wanted to come and talk about the stuff and announce it I mean

45:10.560 --> 45:15.560
I'm not I'm never sure because I got my head up my own ass what do I I see I see tweets

45:15.560 --> 45:19.280
from you and emails and stuff the answer is yes whatever you want to do do you want to

45:19.280 --> 45:23.600
you want to sell these things on the Harmontown yeah I figured that we would maybe do

45:23.600 --> 45:29.120
a batch for the group here and then you know and then and then like maybe just make like

45:29.120 --> 45:33.120
I don't know I don't know what a good number is maybe 30 or 50 or 100 and then anything

45:33.120 --> 45:37.200
we have left over after we sell to anyone here we can put on the Harmontown store if

45:37.200 --> 45:41.200
you want yeah I do can we give the money to the aneurysm foundation or we can I mean I

45:41.200 --> 45:47.080
really need it if you needed this as good I mean I do but I I mean I'd rather my my

45:47.080 --> 45:54.120
mission my my self-given mission in life is to help them out so you know so I would I

45:54.120 --> 45:59.120
mean I originally I wanted to give it to fair audio but you guys were like this screw that

45:59.120 --> 46:05.080
I was like well I'll buy a shirt then just I can drink a couple as Red Bulls next month

46:05.080 --> 46:10.920
we can cut corners in our little smoking room but we could do the yeah absolutely whatever

46:10.920 --> 46:15.840
yeah we could do that all right well whatever yeah we'll figure it out but but so I well

46:15.840 --> 46:20.560
how have you been like what's the I mean I think that's the thing that's foremost on

46:20.560 --> 46:29.080
my mind like when is the last time you had a like a report of your condition it's just

46:29.080 --> 46:35.040
like you have this mysterious condition with an indefinite prognosis and I just like like

46:35.040 --> 46:41.760
what what what is what's going on when you talk to the doctors when what do you know

46:41.760 --> 46:49.680
about well I mean we just I go in I do tests probably every week mostly but some of the

46:49.680 --> 46:53.240
tests are physical so sometimes they'll just have me run on a treadmill and see how long

46:53.240 --> 46:58.600
I can last and then sometimes it's blood work and sometimes it's CT scans or MRIs is there

46:58.600 --> 47:04.960
water at the behind the treadmill yeah they're not getting an accurate result like a pull

47:04.960 --> 47:10.480
of sharks behind no yeah they're not I mean what so when what are they telling you anything

47:10.480 --> 47:16.200
are they just like right now it's I mean they usually tell me things when it gets bad but

47:16.200 --> 47:21.040
right now I mean I'm just on a monitored system so they just they're like it like we said

47:21.040 --> 47:25.640
last time because I'm experiencing things differently than most they're they just keep

47:25.640 --> 47:30.760
a close eye on me but because any anything can turn in my head at the last minute they

47:30.760 --> 47:35.640
just have to constantly keep an eye on me so that's so there's really no news is always

47:35.640 --> 47:39.920
good news for me yeah so so it's also the weirdest news in the world because it's like

47:39.920 --> 47:43.880
this coin flipping up in the air perpetually yeah it's like two faces just living in my

47:43.880 --> 47:47.240
head the weird thing is it's a metaphor I like obviously that's that's that is all of

47:47.240 --> 47:52.120
our condition well of course like yeah yeah well no one tomorrow's not promised anybody

47:52.120 --> 47:55.640
yeah you just that's why I deal with it really well because I'm like oh you know so and so

47:55.640 --> 48:00.880
some could happen to them tomorrow yeah you know so it's it's not but it's like frustrating

48:00.880 --> 48:05.920
to it's like like somebody say something somebody in a weight lab coach say something definitive

48:05.920 --> 48:10.240
anything they're probably wrong nine nine out of ten times anyway but someone what is

48:10.240 --> 48:16.600
what is it as it's like a weird Schrodinger's I mean it does but I I'd ever open the box

48:16.600 --> 48:21.400
I don't want to know like it's better not to know I think for me anyway because I have

48:21.400 --> 48:26.120
so much I'm trying to just live a normal life now so I put that first so I want to make

48:26.120 --> 48:30.120
sure I if I wake up in the morning that's step one I'm like all right cool I'm here

48:30.120 --> 48:33.720
so now what do I got to do I'm like okay so now I get a new job so that's been like that's

48:33.720 --> 48:37.960
why my head's been hurting a lot lately because the kind of the stress of it but I'm adapting

48:37.960 --> 48:43.880
now so so things have kind of cooled off so it's I saw that we were talking about on

48:43.880 --> 48:47.520
the subreddit the Harmontown subreddit you're active in there and I remember seeing you

48:47.520 --> 48:51.520
saying something about how you probably shouldn't be one of the hundred to go to the moon because

48:51.520 --> 48:57.560
for all you know what's happening is hereditary and yeah you could have 99 you know like next

48:57.560 --> 49:03.240
week you know the week after we move but we can make it 101 and I also saw the if you

49:03.240 --> 49:11.000
could be like a minister of fear of death for it for other people I could go to when

49:11.000 --> 49:17.400
I go I need glasses tell me tell me that that's not a big deal the but more importantly we

49:17.400 --> 49:21.640
toyed around so I saw being toyed around the concept of you being the person that chooses

49:21.640 --> 49:26.720
the 100 which I would be fine with I think you would choose better than me well yeah

49:26.720 --> 49:33.600
I mean I look at it's how I approach everything art writing like I look at things of who like

49:33.600 --> 49:38.200
I don't know I feel like that position should be someone that doesn't have an ultimate stake

49:38.200 --> 49:43.720
in it exactly so I thought oh someone who doesn't get to go to the moon colony should

49:43.720 --> 49:48.440
be the one to pick the 100 right and I don't want to go by choice I want it to be a better

49:48.440 --> 49:53.920
society and I feel like a better society wouldn't have wouldn't have to wouldn't look at me

49:53.920 --> 49:56.880
as a burden you know like that's what I that's why I moved back here to LA because when I

49:56.880 --> 50:00.960
was back home with my mom and recovering I think that's all she saw when she looked at

50:00.960 --> 50:05.440
me because there's a lot for her to process you know like that that I was mentally gone

50:05.440 --> 50:10.400
you know that she was like oh my son doesn't remember things anymore so he's a he's there's

50:10.400 --> 50:14.480
a part of them that's not my son anymore so I don't ever want to be a burden to anyone

50:14.480 --> 50:18.840
so I think that's why ultimately I was like oh I'll help pick the 100 and then and then

50:18.840 --> 50:23.640
I'll stay here and you guys are gonna need stuff constantly so I figured that'd be good

50:23.640 --> 50:30.080
for me to be here at the teleporter you know guarding it and making sure supplies are still

50:30.080 --> 50:32.760
getting to you because I feel like once you go up there with your hundred there's gonna

50:32.760 --> 50:36.080
be a lot of disgruntled people down here going why didn't you choose me and they're gonna

50:36.080 --> 50:42.000
want to cut you off and I feel like to seek about your problems exactly I feel like few

50:42.000 --> 50:46.640
people will come up to me and go yeah here's some extra you know flower or whatever send

50:46.640 --> 50:51.840
that to the but I think we could build a seek mannequin and have him down there in that

50:51.840 --> 50:56.040
window that says back for lunch and you could we could smuggle you up to the moon I think

50:56.040 --> 51:01.000
I'll visit I would like to visit my favorite comic book is a bunch of characters that live

51:01.000 --> 51:05.800
on the moon they're called the inhumans so so yeah I love I'm fascinated the first image

51:05.800 --> 51:09.520
I saw when I would get out of the hospital was or when I was conscious of the hospital

51:09.520 --> 51:13.280
was the moon because I woke up at night and I got to see this beautiful thing in the sky

51:13.280 --> 51:17.840
so I I was been drawn to this show because of these little things I feel like a such

51:17.840 --> 51:21.120
an amazing mythical thing the moon and I was like yeah it's been you're looking at you're

51:21.120 --> 51:28.960
looking at the only thing that we looked at before we were even human yeah like it's

51:28.960 --> 51:33.760
built into our you know insects like the reason we've talked about that before like the reason

51:33.760 --> 51:38.480
moths go around sports like this because they're they're instinctively they evolved with the

51:38.480 --> 51:42.320
moon in the sky and they use it as a navigator they keep it on their left side to fly in

51:42.320 --> 51:45.600
a straight line and they get fucked by porch lights and campfires because they think that's

51:45.600 --> 51:52.040
a moon and they like spiral to their death but what for us whether the creators of mythology

51:52.040 --> 51:58.680
was this silver disc in the sky that changes shape it is always up there it is like synonymous

51:58.680 --> 52:05.800
in mythology with femininity the egg that the sperm strive for this this giant radiant

52:05.800 --> 52:11.320
thing up there this this cooling thing that has power over the tide this this monthly

52:11.320 --> 52:19.200
lunar like cycle it's like the most beautiful like fuck the sun it's garbage the sun will

52:19.200 --> 52:25.160
die one day the moon is infinite the sun is murdering us every morning it comes up tries

52:25.160 --> 52:31.680
to kill us for 12 hours and goes back to sleep when the sun dies we go first I mean I'm not

52:31.680 --> 52:35.560
saying the sun ain't got no power I'm just saying I refuse to negotiate with terrorists

52:35.560 --> 52:42.680
I know I know it's I know it's got its hand on the trigger but it's like fuck you spit

52:42.680 --> 52:46.640
your face like you know like we have this you know like whatever you think about President

52:46.640 --> 52:50.920
Obama I'm neither here nor there I don't like give a shit but like like he's in this pickle

52:50.920 --> 52:54.200
about Syria I don't know why he thinks that we should go do this I think he's I think

52:54.200 --> 52:57.600
he was lied to I think we're being lied to about I think it's all a bunch of baloney

52:57.600 --> 53:03.280
I think it's a bigger weirder task in hand that's my theory the pope the pope is on that

53:03.280 --> 53:08.560
case too is there a pope said something I was just browsing around and I just see the headlines

53:08.560 --> 53:11.880
like I'm really out of the loop about the Syria thing but I read a headline that said

53:11.880 --> 53:17.880
like the pope the pope raises the question is Syria happening so that we can sell weapons

53:17.880 --> 53:22.320
is that what's going on really okay I mean yeah he's making a better case for Catholicism

53:22.320 --> 53:27.880
than any pope ever because he likes like queers and stuff he's awesome or kind of he kind

53:27.880 --> 53:33.240
of does I mean as much as a pope I think he probably like deep down does but he knows

53:33.240 --> 53:38.920
what he can and can't say but has there been an apology from the the thing that the Catholic

53:38.920 --> 53:43.440
Church needs to do is there needs to be an acknowledgement and apology about about all

53:43.440 --> 53:52.560
of the covering of the you know the shenanigans that's a real thing that actually needs to

53:52.560 --> 53:56.960
happen is that has that happened I really don't know I know that they can't I mean

53:56.960 --> 54:03.480
yeah I'm sure they feel terrible about it some of them yeah it's not the thought that counts

54:03.480 --> 54:12.480
in this particular case by the time this podcast drops and tomorrow maybe not that President

54:12.480 --> 54:17.600
Obama will be on every today show and morning news show making a case for some strange ass

54:17.600 --> 54:23.120
shit that just seems really like like a lot of malarkey no one knows what the what the

54:23.120 --> 54:29.840
you know the the logic behind this JFK like we like he said let's go to the fucking moon

54:29.840 --> 54:33.360
and let's do it in 10 years and I'll be dead when that happens I'll be dead a couple years

54:33.360 --> 54:39.120
by the time that goes down you know he did he actually did know that that's why he said

54:39.120 --> 54:44.760
it because he was awesome but they built the biggest machine humans are likely to ever

54:44.760 --> 54:50.400
make and they went to the moon and that's badass they lived in a magical crazy time and our

54:50.400 --> 54:57.600
president we have to go do it like I drew a red line we're gonna do it a tactical straggle

54:57.600 --> 55:02.320
limited boots in the grounds and it's like it's like boo fucking let's go to Mars let's

55:02.320 --> 55:07.200
just fucking let's just some cool human shit yeah the only thing that I yeah the only thing

55:07.200 --> 55:11.920
that I know about it is or think about it is like what I read a long time ago and I might

55:11.920 --> 55:20.880
read my little Chomsky book which is just about you know it's like it just feels like we we America

55:20.880 --> 55:26.240
was this kind of brutal capitalistic genius before we went into World War two and we had

55:26.240 --> 55:32.960
this 50 year plan that we are now exiting we have now exited and we are we're trying to

55:32.960 --> 55:38.640
figure out a new 50 year plan like America was whether you love it or hate it like we

55:38.640 --> 55:45.600
were good if you're gonna be proud of something be proud of how we fucking like we we made this

55:45.600 --> 55:50.560
decision that we were the Han Solo of the planet that we were I got no love for the empire but

55:50.560 --> 55:55.760
you know and it wouldn't make a book kind of like we were we hung back and we didn't believe in the

55:55.760 --> 56:00.640
force and we kept our blaster at our side and we we had our the Atlantic Ocean between us and

56:00.640 --> 56:05.760
any trouble and we just like we we just wanted to know what's in it for us and then we had this

56:05.760 --> 56:10.960
50 year thing that started with our involvement in World War two that turned out fine and dandy

56:10.960 --> 56:16.240
for us and and and now we're living in the past the finish line of all that and I think

56:16.240 --> 56:22.240
you know like we're there were there people were allowed to be more brutal back then they were

56:22.240 --> 56:27.040
allowed to be more secretive they were allowed to you know there were there was a what a quarter

56:27.040 --> 56:33.120
of the population back then at least half like like less people plain and simple half as many

56:33.120 --> 56:40.240
problems and half as many ways to fuck up and but it was like now we're the you know Generation X

56:40.240 --> 56:46.080
is 40 and and the millennials are going what are we doing and they have like like all of this

56:46.960 --> 56:51.040
communication with each other and it's just you can't just have a buzz cut and sit at your barbecue

56:51.040 --> 56:57.520
in the front yard and go let's get them Ruskies like it does it that works so well and we don't

56:57.520 --> 57:03.760
know how to get that back and we're trying really hard to get that business model operating by you

57:03.760 --> 57:08.240
know it's like okay it's like the Nielsen system going like now you're watching this like this

57:08.240 --> 57:14.080
this Obama versus Putin shit like I'm not political I don't care about politics I'm not I'm not like

57:14.080 --> 57:18.160
like you know Greg Brooks or someone that reads the papers all the time like it's like it seems

57:18.160 --> 57:24.080
like we're just trying to really disingenuously trying to create a cold war again where you know

57:24.080 --> 57:28.880
like that we hate the Russians again like like nobody fucking cares about us anymore and nobody

57:28.880 --> 57:36.400
cares about Russia like it's so it's so I feel so bad for everybody and like like I feel like a CNN

57:36.400 --> 57:40.720
I feel like if Wolf if Wolf Blitzer because they get so fucking excited about war whenever there's

57:40.720 --> 57:45.120
a prospect of any kind of conflict I feel like Wolf Blitzer personally owned a boat and some

57:45.120 --> 57:49.200
missiles Syria would Damascus will be done already like he would have fucking gone over

57:49.200 --> 57:53.600
himself and done it he'd be plugging one ear with his beautiful hair whipping in the wind

57:53.600 --> 57:59.920
I'm off the coast of Damascus right now and boy it's lit up like 4th of July also we're Wolf Blitzer

57:59.920 --> 58:09.440
I fucking he is he's not smart he's not he he seems kind of half retarded the guy I I'm talking loud

58:09.440 --> 58:16.480
and I don't know about juji juju but bb like who fucking vetted this cock he's like well who vetted

58:16.480 --> 58:24.160
him fucking like why first of all Wolf Blitzer no stupid name wait isn't there a name there's a

58:24.160 --> 58:30.400
chick on cncs and be seen in crystal ball her name is crystal ball and she's a fucking journalist

58:30.400 --> 58:36.560
which is awesome because let's let's let's just call it a spade a spade like really like we gave

58:36.560 --> 58:41.600
up a long time ago but Wolf Blitzer needs to fucking stop talking because he's a fucking douchey

58:41.600 --> 58:47.520
douchey mccockadoodle douchebag well I don't even yeah it's gotten so bare bones that it's I don't

58:47.520 --> 58:51.120
even think it's treasonous anymore to say that the curtain has dropped on the concept of state

58:51.120 --> 58:55.760
run television you're just looking at people it's almost like if there was a war that networks would

58:55.760 --> 58:59.120
make more money because we were watching more television watching it and it seems like a lot

58:59.120 --> 59:02.720
of the networks are owned by companies that make weapons they're like we're kicking that cynical

59:02.720 --> 59:06.320
about it but you don't have to be that cynical we're how you doing by the way seek

59:06.320 --> 59:15.120
what's your Syria plan um well we're going to the moon so we don't have to worry about Syria

59:16.960 --> 59:20.800
we're not gonna go to the moon before we know where the serious shit goes no probably somebody

59:20.800 --> 59:25.360
somebody was somebody yelled at me on reddit for having this kind of like like we're we're abandoning

59:25.360 --> 59:30.320
the world or we needed down here and all that stuff I mean it I don't know because the way I

59:30.320 --> 59:36.240
look at it is what I think what the world lacks the most of is pioneers and and that's why I put

59:36.240 --> 59:40.400
that dedication at the beginning of soul star right when you open up it's as dedicated to all

59:40.400 --> 59:45.760
pioneers and that's actually from an anime that I really love called macros plus which is about

59:46.640 --> 59:51.440
man that has past earth they're they're they're out there we're out in the universe we're doing

59:51.440 --> 59:56.240
other things we're we're creating machines and life on other planets and uh and I just see like

59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.160
right now we have pioneers in technology like they're making the newest phone and they're making

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:05.280
the newest thing we can consume but they're not taking us places they're not expanding us they're

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:10.240
not evolving us really and that was one of my that's on my list did you hear me earlier I said

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.400
what what has the species done I don't want I'm not asking this in a cynical way I wanted to ask

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:18.640
it in a like like because I'm very proud of our species I think obviously we have to be what are

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:25.360
we gonna root for giraffes or I will say I will say as someone who's been close to the the because

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:33.280
that I loved here in uh was it Beth last week um your your neighbor was it the week before but

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:36.800
I loved hearing her talk because I think that's what I was tweeting you too she was

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:42.320
so close to saying what I've been saying for years but every time I say it freaks people out

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:47.120
about what it's like when you're when you feel like you're gone from this plane you would

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:53.360
I'm very proud of humanity too because of I've seen what it's like to not be a part of it anymore

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:59.840
so you know when people when you have a bad day just trust me it's it's not as bad as you think

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:06.000
it is I promise you because there is unbelievable things we can all do it's I'm really proud of

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.120
the human race I just I get this I get disillusioned sometimes when I see the crappy things we do

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:16.320
but I'm 10 times I'm lifted 10 times higher when I see something amazing and positive we do the

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:21.520
potential energy is so it's gotten to the point where it's almost ludicrous that we haven't kind

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.920
of burst but unfortunately our species history would seem to indicate that it's going to get

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:33.360
you know it has to get worse before this like incredible like ray of light like shoots out

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:40.240
by necessity they were a species that is constantly you know we were the first 90% of our history

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.680
we're in gods crosshairs you know just surviving ice ages and and bears were not something that

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.240
you tucked your kids into bed with at night and dogs were not something that fetched your slippers

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.560
these were these were these were equally intelligent animals as far as we were concerned

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.680
they're like they had everything we had we didn't have an alphabet yet and they were like we were

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:03.040
competing for lunch with them and half the time being lunch and and the triumphs that we have

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:07.360
achieved in the face of that like we should be patting ourselves in the back now we're in this

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:13.360
most recent chapter where our species is going through this acne-ridden pubescent phase where

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:20.160
there's a violence this hormonal oily explosions all over us we've covered the earth we're choking it

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:27.200
um we're affecting it and we we're like we are we have gotten to the point we were absolutely

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.320
capable of turning everything around and the only thing standing in the way at this point

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:38.480
is just this reluctance to do it we're just we because we because how is it going to start

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.960
what what would anyone do how would you what who's going to be the Rosa Parks of an entire planet

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:48.480
who's going to who's going to stand under a under a bodhi tree this time and just go I'm not moving

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:55.440
until shit gets real uh like like I invite all of the it's a what and obviously that's a horrible

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.440
example that's not what it's going to take like that those are called hacky-sackers they're not

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:05.600
changing anything I like what what what what what can we do I mean the answer is we have to take on

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:12.640
this like crazy non-marketable like Spock mentality where we start going like okay we're going to do

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:19.040
this thing and it's like uh fuck it I don't know whatever like like like we're we're we're we're

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:23.360
very we're very we're very close but it's yeah well the thing is you have to it's like it's

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:27.360
probably I imagine for you like when you're writing there's a there's a technique you have to do where

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.440
you at when you get to a certain point in whatever store you're telling where you have to literally

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:37.280
break your brain to think in the shoes of that character or that person or whatever I think

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.920
there's a a point where we just have to teach each other that technique how to break your

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:47.680
brain and think differently even if it's just momentarily because I think you you you expand

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:52.240
that way you know like you you grow that way I mean that's all of us go through that when we go

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:57.600
through puberty like you said like at this stage we're in like 13 to 17 and and even past that I

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:03.680
mean I'm technically three years old you know I learned words three years ago I learned writing

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:09.360
three years ago and and walking three you know three years ago so it's like it's um you know

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.200
I'm constantly learning new things like there's sometimes people see something I tweet and they're

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:17.440
like oh that was kind of passive aggressive I'm like I just learned what that was I thought it was

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:27.120
aggressive yeah I'm like and easy yeah so it's uh you know I I'm constantly reconfiguring my brain

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:33.120
because I have to and I feel like uh that's what we should pass on it to other people is to get

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.560
them to do that because it's not a permanent thing you don't have to crack it like an egg and it's

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:41.040
done you know you could put it back together um you know it's almost like a transformer

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:45.920
in a in a yeah we all have to reference way we have to become triple changers exactly

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:55.280
before this planet uh uh becomes the first transformer movie and kills off Optimus Prime

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.040
and tries to replace it with Rodimus Prime what oh boy uh all right uh thank you Seek for coming

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:11.680
by I was uh happy to hear from you thank you sir all right

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.240
I don't know Jeff what's up what's on the what's on the list there there's some goodies on that

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.600
well we gotta I mean well one thing is like tonight I want a hundred percent commit to D&D

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:30.320
now tell me what you think that means like what to you 100 character immersion I've been listening

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:36.000
to and they're hey it's not a feral audio podcast but you gotta tip your hat to the to the enemy

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:43.040
sometimes uh but for those of you who are constantly redditing and tweeting and things about your uh

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:48.640
your dissatisfaction as D&D purists about the level of D&D craftsmanship going out of the stage

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.880
there are people out there that don't think we're playing this game properly there are a couple

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:59.120
people who not giving our all there are a couple people who are so enamored with our desire to

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:04.480
bring D&D into the into the mainstream here that they are then they then feel betrayed a little bit

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:11.360
I think by our sloppy drunken uh bad D&D playing and a lot of love they want to see us do better

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:15.920
they they believe we can do better oh go look yeah that's for those of us for those of you who'd

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:20.320
feel that way to the point where you wish you weren't listening uh to to to ours I will say I've

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:26.000
just started listening to Brian Posein's uh nerd poker podcast uh which is not in front of a live

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.280
audience it's literally just uh it's just Brian Posein and Blaine Capac and other friends uh

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:37.440
playing D&D for like an hour and a half in the comfort of their own home and they've been playing

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:42.400
for they were friends that started playing 20 years ago and they they're playing very very immersed

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:49.040
D&D and doing doing doing great at it having a good it's it's it's night and day from what we do here

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:53.920
the here's what I would say I want to get well that's Spencer actually Spencer come up let's

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:57.520
let's bring Spencer up and talk about it yeah

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:10.160
hello Spencer what what what's up you guys now Spencer okay let's let's now if Dan wants to talk

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.080
about getting serious about this because as you know Spencer and I think everyone that plays with me

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:20.080
now I've become overly immersed in D&D I've become very like like intensely involved and I love it

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:27.200
yeah but we play Pathfinder on Saturdays now with our private friendly group what we're playing

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:34.880
right now is what 3.5 D&D on stage yeah yeah now I don't have that core rulebook or the D&D book on

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:39.200
that one and so I've never taken my character sheet home so when I see my character sheet at the end

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:43.360
of every Harmontown I'm looking at stuff for the first time every week I don't know what I don't

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:49.600
know what half of my spells are or you know magical weapons do so like and I can't look them up so

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:54.560
maybe it's time for me to like email me a sheet I could look at it and I would come here more

01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:03.360
prepared and ready to rumble yeah well that's fine we could do that right oh yeah so so again

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:07.680
remember the reason Jeff doesn't want to do Spencer for Halloween is because when when it got mentioned

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:15.120
Spencer reacted unenthusiastically right which is a great barometer to use for all decisions

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:23.360
hey Spencer should I fry an egg for breakfast tomorrow go for it or should I just kill myself

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:31.280
sure man so it's hard best to use your own compass he's a great guy but let's not chart our course

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:38.000
by I think Jeff did a great job of explaining kind of what my apprehensions are I don't like I think

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.440
it'd be fine if everyone did it but I think the negative like the con side of my head was thinking

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:48.880
kind of the same stuff I understand the potential social ramifications and discomfort of somebody

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:54.160
going like let's all dress like Tyler for Halloween and there's like a very fine line between that

01:08:54.160 --> 01:09:00.640
and everyone going let's all do our impression of Toby you know like I we all are gonna get anxious

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:05.920
about that and and I would never like like I obviously volunteer myself to be the center of

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:10.800
attention and come what may I take the good with the bad other people you know it's like Spencer

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:17.440
likes coming up here but he didn't sign up for being crucified publicly but so I get all that but

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:22.480
I think I don't think a sea of people with beards from the Hollywood toy store is going to like

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:27.760
drive anyone to suicide or no me neither I think it won't but also if you're gonna dress up like

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:33.440
somebody for me because I'm a like a style junkie I would want to do it right and I think it'd be

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:38.240
hard to pull off a proper Spencer because beards and wigs are usually shitty unless you spend

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:43.120
zillions of dollars on them it would be very hard to pull off a proper Spencer beer so I think

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:48.240
what I'd be doing was a pale caricature which is doesn't do anybody any justice and it's like

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:53.840
why bother it's just this is just any frigate person now you're talking to a guy who went and

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:59.200
bought a wig a Tina Turner wig online and took it to my hairstylist sat down put it on and he cut

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:06.080
it and styled it to make my jerry's wig I mean I mean we uh we uh I cut and colored that motherfucker

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:13.680
and it looks but that's but anyways this is a this was not Spencer's idea about the dnd full

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.920
immersion nor was it my suggestion that we all do it or anything like that I was just making a

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:23.200
kind of new year's resolution if you will that I'm gonna try at least for tonight like I want to

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:28.800
really try to let's do it be immersed in my character I'm all for it I say I say we all really

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:33.040
just dive in I feel like it's something like wearing this pad around my neck which is you know

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.720
it's an all or nothing deal like like you know I'm leaving the house with it I'm like do I really

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:42.320
need to wear this to to the bathroom uh to the or to the gas station like like do you well the

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:48.160
answer is yeah you have to it's all or nothing you wear to the bathroom well I have to otherwise if

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:52.400
you don't wear it all the time then it's not there's not gonna you know if you can't there's no

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.760
way to go like I'm gonna wear this pad because I think I'm entering a situation where I'm gonna

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:59.200
think of something I might want to write down so obviously you I mean I'm assuming you take it off

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.080
to go to bed you take it off to go in the shower you're not wearing it for those things but you

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.360
do have to don't shower you what I don't shower so do you bath do you bathe still you take you

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:14.480
take your baths or no yeah a little more hesitant than last time I haven't been bathing like crazy

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:19.840
yeah you're in work mode now you're in Vietnam yeah you're gonna get like bad tattoos and stuff

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:24.640
like that yeah so you but you do remember in the morning it's by the bed by your keys and your phone

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:29.520
you put it on and you say okay this is it and Spencer make me a tinier one it was the i-harmon

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:39.280
nano it was like the size of like a fortune cookie kind of but I lost that one but again these are

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:44.320
cheap that's that's not you know I think you're a better person there's a there's a guy raising

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:49.920
his hand that we've never seen before I don't think I saw you last night you weren't wearing it

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:59.200
oh where were you I was at the UCB all right no I just look I this guy this guy a fellow in the

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.520
audience is saying I saw you last night you weren't wearing it at UCB and I promised Aaron in the

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:11.120
green room I wouldn't throw her to this pack of hungry people like this is gonna be I took it off

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:16.240
before I went to UCB because I she saw me wearing it getting ready to go to the UCB

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:25.280
and by her she she I'm trying as hard as I can to be fair to her she was being protective of me

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.880
and she was just flashing back to being the nerd that she was and like trying to protect me

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.520
knowing that I am a person that will leave the house with like my pants tucked into my socks

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:41.600
without knowing it like and with like a cat on my head like she often needs to save me from the

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:46.800
public and and she but she looked at the finger on my neck and she said you're gonna so you're

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.680
gonna wear that so the hole you're gonna wear that out so the UCB and everything huh and I was

a photo he had just happened to have in that suit of him and Dino at 17 years old and it breaks your

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:56.080
heart I mean not because of anything except we're all old I mean like Dino's got photos on his fridge

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.280
yeah we have to well speaking of the subreddit we have to you know I've invited people to make

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:22.400
requests and stuff because it's a place for people to congregate and and rehash the show and and have

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:30.880
a long vitriolic totally justified reactions to social consciousness unfolding on stage

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:37.680
uh but and so you know people want Dino up here and I mean I I could I could press a button as

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:43.520

a little like uh oh like like if I were your girlfriend I would have said that's right I mean

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:22.960
I perform at UCB it's like high school UCB feels like high school to me I think that's what I was

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:27.040
the thing that made me think twice about it was that it was a show about writers that's I didn't

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:34.240
want to yeah then that I was like walk out with a notepad around my neck also uh the artist that

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:35.440
cats learn whatever you teach well Andrew you're your first time visitor but are you a long time

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:40.160
listener are you uh I've actually I was looking at the just looking around for comedy spots and

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:43.360
oh you picked the show I said that sounds cool I'm gonna check that out have you ever have you

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:51.920
ever played have you ever played role playing games or a bit in a threesome

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:59.600
when we're we're two-thirds of the people we're willing are you ready to be uh fully immersed

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:04.720
I've actually never played Dungeons and Dragons or any of those games but

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:09.200
well I don't know how it's probably not that hard let's let's have Andrew play

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:14.640
uh all right Christopher Andrew will you join us I am just because uh

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.000
let's just go for it I know nothing about Dungeons and Dragons it's pretty easy I think

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.240
you'll find we know very little too yeah you're gonna receive sheets of paper with a bunch of

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:30.160
numbers and stats on them that that are will confuse uh and arouse you and uh but you'll

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:33.840
be playing a character called Christopher who's normally played by Kumail Manjiani frequently

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:38.720
by Tyler okay uh and you're right you're right he's a rogue human right yeah so you're kind of

01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:43.280
like a thief and uh you know like you know you're good at like you know like stealing stuff and

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:48.160
snarky yeah and you have you'll see your list of weapons and stuff like that okay is there an

01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:52.400
easy way to get to get you up on stage with us what what's the best yeah I can get out there

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:57.280
if you hold this get my crutches all right let's welcome Andrew to the stage everyone

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:04.080
also and this is such a weird part of Christopher's character

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:08.720
you're always commenting on how my character is really beautiful it's a weird quirk

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:16.720
Tyler just booed me I was kidding I was kidding you were not

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:21.520
wow Dustin Marshall is like like uh Dustin Marshall everybody

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:31.440
mine producer to the best fat guest all right we really I mean now we're learning all too late

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:40.000
this stage needs a ramp yeah we can all go to jail for you we are we are not being very uh I am

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.240
also going to fully immerse okay we're all going to fully immerse Andrew doesn't have to because he

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:48.560
doesn't I mean yeah he you can constantly ask what the hell am I doing okay I probably will yeah

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:54.960
yeah you're fine um but it's basically it's it's it's it's uh it's it's storytelling

01:30:54.960 --> 01:31:00.480
Spencer's the dungeon master he's telling a story and we're all participants in it and it's sort of

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:05.600
like if we're in combat we'll all take turns and he'll ask you what you're doing and you're

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:09.920
going to look at your possessions list and you're going to make things out of them so like think of

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:15.600
how you can combine those don't listen to her Andrew no I'm just looking at this and if you'll

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:22.400
have everyone emotionally you'll be fine all right what what is what is this yellow sticky

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:30.800
and then don't worry don't worry about it don't worry about it just just ignore all okay these are your

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:34.240
weapons you can shoot a short mo a sap or a ribbon dagger okay this is a controversial topic such a

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:41.280
nice day and you can you can say that we had pizza in bed that's fine well yeah now the Jeff

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:49.680
hasn't had pizza in bed yeah no I've never I don't eat a lot in bed uh I don't I think Dan and I eat

01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:59.920
more than you all right Spencer let's begin this shall we yeah Jeff just eats pussy

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:13.760
wrangling traveling down a road I just got a bench a woman who doesn't want to be with him

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:21.280
it's good feeling Spencer feeling it feeling it when last met our heroes had just laid low a mighty

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:27.600
snowflake deep within the dungeons of Admiral Darkstars black key after patching up their

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:32.560
wounds and ascending stairs they entered a large room with giant buttons on the walls

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:41.280
and a giant porcupine on the floor they began fighting they still are all right that's all

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:48.560
that happened yeah all right so the porcupine is still alive yeah we cut it up pretty good last

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:55.200
time yeah you were pretty far but email not quite yeah by the way someone someone on the subreddit

01:32:55.200 --> 01:33:01.840
suggested you know announcing what are our hit points are at the uh at the beginning of each

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:06.720
session because I know I lose track yeah because I don't have a pencil up here when I play when I

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:11.040
play privately I'm able to keep track of my own hit points but yeah I don't know where I am I don't

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:16.640
know how close yeah I am you have a pen on your necklace shut up but I'm not gonna write on my

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:21.120
character sheet with a pen you write on your pad with a pen I know what do you like life coach

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:26.240
Adam Goldberg is just popping like popcorn tonight what does your hit points say right

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:30.960
for a month make Adam Goldberg their life coach like Tyler was raising his hands he's excited

01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:34.800
about Grand Theft Auto and then Adam was like heckling Tyler that's when I got frustrated I was

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:39.120
like shut up you're both you like don't make me come back there you know like it was just like

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:46.000
this is out of hand what do you know what you're my favorite I'm saying but you're all my children

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000
and you're like the collection of it was pissing me off like you're raising your hand like I want

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.520
to talk about Grand Theft Auto and then he's like let it go don't do any more and you're like

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:57.760
he's throwing peas at me and like I'm like I'm taking you both on a grand canyon I'm like

01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:02.400
I'm gonna throw you in Dan total immersion in your character

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:08.880
no tangents maybe as our characters we should say how we're feeling

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:18.800
just to immerse all right I'm Christopher Andrew yeah I as a gnome barbarian and still in a fight

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:22.960
with a giant porcupine monster I'm feeling like we should still continue to kick this porcupine

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:30.240
monster's ass and move forward yeah porcupine monster all right what's going on I'll put

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:38.480
it at Jeff's turn I take out my my flaming sword and attack the uh straight at his uh at his neck

01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:42.800
attacking straight at his neck with your flaming sword your strike connects with his necks

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:50.080
the burning sword cuts into his flesh and goes about a foot and a half deep it severs pretty

01:34:50.080 --> 01:35:03.600
heftily I'd say dealing 17 damage yeah um you see blood kind of pour out of his throat and he falls

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:10.560
down on the floor you see Andrew it's that easy it's that easy so are we are we just going after

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:15.520
the porcupines well he's dead now we got him yeah okay so now it's just but now there are I think

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:20.640
there are there's still some big weird stone buttons on the walls yeah so before you you see a door

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.920
it's a big orange door on either side of this door you see three large round buttons there

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:31.760
probably each about four feet wide circular buttons on this wall there's also a hole in the

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:39.040
ceiling from which comes a long copper pendulum it's just hanging down there it's it's in front

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:43.360
of the buttons or where is it in relationship to them it's in front of the door so it's kind of like

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:48.480
in the direct middle of this room can it reach the buttons if you were to hit it if you were to

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:52.560
hit the pendulum you could hit the pendulum or you could hit the buttons but what if you hit the

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:58.400
pendulum would it's could it swing and hit a button um I mean it would probably go too high

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:08.160
I guess Andrew he's he's immersed he's good I just I'm glad I was here the day that Aaron

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:18.080
fell in love with a new person I mean I just wanted to be happy I go up and examine the buttons

01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:24.320
to see if there's any markings or runes or anything upon them they're not they're just rather slick

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:31.040
shiny buttons hmm well there's four of us and there's four buttons there's six buttons there's

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:38.640
oops there's six of us yeah there's four of us and six buttons all right there's a door there's

01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.880
four buttons there's six buttons there's six buttons anybody in the crowd have any three on

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:50.240
either side of the door uh yeah uh you have eight hands Sandy what were you gonna say I was gonna

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:56.640
mimic Adam Goldberg but I mean you've got to push the buttons well we have yeah okay okay I tear

01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:10.720
apart my sack and I I tie it using my tie use my rope to tie it to my water skins and create a

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:20.160
shield in front of the buttons so we can stand behind this water skin bedroll shield I'm just

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:25.920
gonna touch the push the left the leftmost button and see what happens but I'm but I'm standing behind

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:36.400
that shield just in case your shield what is it it's like a fort like a living room fort

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:41.520
two water skins does not make a fort a fort's not a shield it doesn't make a shield either

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:48.640
I love you Spencer you have rope I think why would you rip up a sack to tie stuff with

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:55.840
it well the rope is stringing it out like like beef jerky you form a shield

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:04.880
okay you sold me you sold me don't bring you into this beef jerky bill uh right okay sorry

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:09.760
no okay so you're holding this out these two water skins yeah you're just I'm immersed in

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:15.920
my character you're the character of a homeless person that thinks that the government's trying

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:22.960
to read their mind I tell everybody about my protect me I go up and examine the pendulum

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:26.640
is there anything on the pendulum how's it attached to the ceiling it goes up into this

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:31.200
hole in the ceiling it's a rather big hole maybe about can you six feet around can you see

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:38.800
what's if you look up can you see what's outside of the hole blackness but we know it's a hole

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:43.600
quarter crystal burger goes up like a black hole okay maybe crawl up that that that that rope

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.960
the since the hole's big enough that you could find out what's up there I want to I want to

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:51.040
try to press the leftmost button I'm gonna stand back while you do that because I'm afraid I stand

01:38:51.040 --> 01:39:00.320
behind my shield I look at your shield and go wow you press the leftmost button and you hear a

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:08.800
rumbling sound from overhead oops I say sorry shouldn't have had that whatever we had this is

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:15.520
your full character immersive yeah I'm looking forward to that starting by the way all right

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:27.760
shit what's that rumbling there we go yeah so you look up to see lava pouring out of this hole

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:44.720
in the ceiling it's getting hot in here yeah are you doing lava sound yeah I think I'd be better

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:50.240
just doing sound effects all right can I follow your heart you're a songwriter you wrote the lady

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:54.960
in red the wonder of the 80s so lava's coming down around the pendulum yeah pours down this hole

01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:59.840
not around the pendulum but from that same hole and it pours down and starts to pool it's pulling

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:06.560
up around the floor whoops move away from it okay can I I see that I have a new tree token

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:11.600
where are we getting these skills that we're looking at that where we're getting these uh

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:20.480
oh I didn't look at this other paper I pressed I pressed the second leftmost button okay so

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:25.680
none of you want to like move out of the lava floor because I said you'd have to and then no

01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:33.360
respond I've I've repositioned as far away from the lava as I can't perfect I also I I pack up my

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:40.640
shield I also do but wait I have a climbing kit that's true can we climb the pendulum um you can

01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:47.040
try yeah yeah let's climb that and see what's up there all right so you you try to scramble up this

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:52.080
pendulum and as you pull it you feel it it kind of gives like it goes chunk and falls down a little

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:57.600
bit and um as it falls down a little bit you hear another rumbling sound coming from this hole and

01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:06.720
it also sounds like the grinding of metal plates um yeah it sounds ominous is there lava near the

01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:10.560
buttons can we get to the button safely without being in lava at this point you guys are on one

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:17.280
side like you're between the lava and the buttons so like if the how fast is the lava moving towards

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:21.600
us it's not moving towards you anymore because you moved out of the way in fact it's starting to

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:27.840
drain down this drain in the floor so I guess you guys moved out of the way I hop over the lava

01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:32.720
well you already okay so but I'm already close to the yeah if you want to go to the other side

01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:39.600
but you're already okay all right I hit another button okay well I put let's keep track of it

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:45.040
did I hit the second button not yet I was still doing is climbing so the grinding sound continues

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:51.840
and then um you hear a chunk chunk chunk like um falling boulders coming from above above this hole

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:59.520
and you're still dangling on this essentially a rope under this hole look out yeah I have another

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:06.320
question I don't know if this could help us sure I it says I'm an escape artist can we escape from

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:14.240
here I don't know I don't know if that's you know do you have do you have disabled device

01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:20.400
under skills yeah yeah could he could he try to disable the vice or use perception on the door

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:26.160
and figure out how to how to open it yeah I mean definitely let's uh disable the device then okay

01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:32.240
so you get off this pendulum thing to go over to the door which is the device you're disabling

01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:38.160
I'm assuming um so so you go over to this door and you're checking it out and this grinding

01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:45.440
continues and then a giant giant block of ice crashes down where this pendulum was from the hole

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:55.040
in the ceiling oh weird I'm immersed I'm immersed you don't you you don't find a way to uh unlock

01:42:55.040 --> 01:43:00.720
this door however so did he was that was that a trap that was meant to kill somebody I've been

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:06.000
beneath it or what all I'm saying is that he pulled on this thing and then a giant cube of ice fell

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:19.360
down push the button pull the chain you will experience an icy rain I pressed the third button

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:25.840
if a chocolate choo choo train comes out we'll know that Spencer writes us uh during the show

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:31.840
I mean yeah well as you press the button you hear uh it sounds like a squelching sound and

01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:35.440
thick black tar oozes from this hole in the ceiling

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:38.640
chocolate choo choo train

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:46.080
I mean it's all it sounds like a chocolate choo choo train we've got to figure out how to fill

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:54.880
this room with milk and lemonade we're gonna die is there something we could tie an 150 foot rope

01:43:54.880 --> 01:44:00.320
to and climb out or you can try and climb up out of that hole in the ceiling but you wouldn't need

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:06.960
the rope oh let's not use the rope okay so one button made lava one button made ice one button

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:12.560
made black tar there's one button left one of these is gonna be there's three left there's three

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:19.680
more there's gonna be milk lemonade it's milk oh milk lemonade and out of the hole fudges made

01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:27.440
okay I go push one of the other fourth fourth button fourth button fourth button

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:35.440
um yeah you just hear a bubbling sound and purple mist pours into the room out of the ceiling

01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:43.200
hole positive purple mist he seemed a little bummed out yeah yeah I mean it's not as negative

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:52.160
as it could have been cool party atmosphere or is it is it scary is it making us feel good purple

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:59.360
mist or no it's like it's like definitely caustic and burning your throat and tearing out your eyes

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:04.560
and uh okay so it's bad purple mist yeah not the kind of purple mist one thing's for sure I'm

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:10.000
pushing all these buttons before we die I'm not going to go to my my death going like what about

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.480
the six button we gotta figure it out what do you think the point of the pendulum is this pendulum

01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:21.600
is here I'm immersed in my character that has oh shit I have 19 intelligence yeah use it I guess

01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:28.640
I would have been smarter than I know I just saw that I have nine but you know my 19 I just

01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:33.040
try just just for just because I'm curious I swing I swing the pendulum to see what happens if I move

01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:37.040
the pendulum from side to side you push the pendulum and it kind of goes a little bit before

01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:41.840
coming back to equilibrium and stopping but then the grinding noise starts and you see another

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:47.920
chunk of ice fall through the ceiling it's a big block cube of ice and it's chunk and we've

01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:52.080
climbed that ice out of here yeah like the ice and the lava got something to do with each other

01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:55.920
well how does that is the ice hitting the lava landing in lava well at this point all the lava

01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:01.600
is drained out there's sticky tar covering the floor but uh and the first button made lava come down

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:06.800
yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna push another button which one the fifth button the fifth button

01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:15.520
you push the fifth button and a steady stream of fizzling brown fluid comes from the whole

01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:25.280
not even right around the corner fudges yeah well I mean but like root beer yeah

01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:31.520
yeah fizzling brown liquid comes out yeah and what's it what's it what's its properties what's it

01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:39.600
I don't know is it hot is it cold do you want to interact with it as a character

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:44.160
we want to smell it you smell it and you smell 23 cents

01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:52.880
street value no no like different different sense oh sharpie should be a small year

01:46:52.880 --> 01:47:01.440
uh I I take I take my pinky finger and I I put it in the brown fizzling liquid

01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:08.880
it's a bit tingling on your finger like good tingling yeah yeah like friendly oh I jump on it

01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:19.520
I roll around with it I laugh I laugh it's delight I put my finger in and I taste it

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:28.400
it tastes like the 23 flavors of dr pepper that's right dr pepper now comes in diet

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:37.280
wait a minute the fifth button dispenses dr pepper okay I said I'd immerse myself in character but

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:43.120
not when I smell a paola scandal happening and Spencer who have you been talking to and what

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:51.680
shouldn't you try to pull when you need to get out of life's dungeon crack open a dr pepper

01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:55.440
all right we have not been paying the dungeon master

01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:02.000
just making deals out of the table have you been approached by corporate sponsorship

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:11.200
no no it just became a funny detour oh god I I I take off my shirt and and while I take it off

01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:15.360
I imagine that I'm a sexy construction worker and there's girls going by like in the diet

01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:22.080
dr pepper commercial that I happen I and I have a nice refreshing goblets of of dr pepper I press

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:31.920
the six button more more sticky black tar pours out is it so the ceiling okay all right is it

01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:38.560
coke no it's like a it's like a sticky black tar all right I jump on the pendulum grab the

01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:42.800
grab the rope and then jump off and see if an ice block falls down a third ice block falls down

01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:47.840
on top of the other one yeah are they stacking up can we no because okay so like the one hit it

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:52.880
I should explain this at the time what am I thinking the first one hit it off center and

01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:56.880
the toppled and it kind of slid apart and then the third one went between them so now there's

01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:03.360
kind of like three ice blocks on roughly even floor I try to climb out of the hole the hole in

01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:08.720
the ceiling it's about 30 feet higher than standing on top of one of those ice how tall are the ice

01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:17.840
blocks the ice blocks are about seven feet tall audience anybody have any ideas oh yeah

01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:25.520
a young lady shouted out fill the room with dr pepper and float on the ice cubes up to the same

01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:36.480
and also float on the on the taste sensation of 23 natural natural flavors I go to the fifth button

01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:44.000
and I and I push my back against it to push up more dr pepper comes I keep on I jump on the pendulum

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:49.920
and keep yanking for more ice ice and dr pepper fill the room with a delicious reflection a

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:57.520
refreshing refreshing refreshing it it refreshes you guys all right fills up the room it's it's

01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:04.640
going towards the top all right the ice cubes are floating I these things that we that have happened

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:12.160
to us yeah it's been quite a day uh are we are we floating up now like I mean that depends on

01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:16.480
what you're doing when this room is being filled up with dr pepper I'm treading I'm not a witch I

01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:25.280
float oh no I am a witch I float which is flow regular people sink I have 11 swim skill like

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:31.120

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:51.280
regret at the end there's no fan at the time I'm just getting under the hole and treading water and

01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:58.400
I keep yanking on the the chain and making ice come ice fill up yeah so I mean it goes up to

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:03.760
the top and you got a bunch of ice and I got this slippery floating floor and you think that you

01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:08.080
might be able to scramble up into this hole that you guys were working towards I try to scramble

01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:15.360

01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:27.360
okay I can't look at you right now

01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:37.360
but yeah so you get out of this area and you find yourself in a in a great black hall the walls are

01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:43.040
all iron and there's a four doors one of them leads up a staircase that goes up what looks like

01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:48.000
maybe a tower a spire sort of thing I look back at the group and I say you guys I don't know what

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:58.080
dr pepper is but it really was a pick me up or literally picked us up to the hole can you not

01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:04.640
