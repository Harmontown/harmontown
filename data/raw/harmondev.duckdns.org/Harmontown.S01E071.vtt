we've made up for last week\n\n02:19.280 --> 02:24.920\ncertainly certainly a little more mainstream accessible than the last hour or so of last\n\n02:24.920 --> 02:30.280\nweek hey man weekly podcast off the top of our head unedited take the good with the bad and fuck\n\n02:30.280 --> 02:40.600\noff alright so let's see my garage stinks I need glasses I'd like to commit a hundred percent to\n\n02:40.600 --> 02:48.960\nD&D tonight I'm wondering about premium gas I've been thinking about like what has the species\n\n02:48.960 --> 02:54.200\naccomplished other than things relative to the species I'd like to know how Spencer's enjoying\n\n02:54.200 --> 02:59.400\nbeing my assistant seek Donnelly's here tonight our annuals annualism surviving friend would like\n\n02:59.400 --> 03:05.760\nto speak with us for a little bit I had an emotional memory about brown deer Wisconsin\n\n03:05.760 --> 03:13.800\non the 4th of July that made me sad tonight and I'd like to talk about to Spencer about possible\n\n03:13.800 --> 03:19.800\nimprovements to my pad of paper device because it must be said to the home listener that you\n\n03:19.800 --> 03:24.240\nare not reading it's so much more efficient than reading off your phone you're reading off of the\n\n03:24.240 --> 03:29.440\neye Harmon yeah chest notes well listen listen to how much shit just tonight I this is one page from\n\n03:29.440 --> 03:38.480\ntonight I used this thing while driving over here that is still illegal I'm sure it is but I mean\n\n03:38.480 --> 03:44.240\nevery everything's being humans illegal I mean that's actually more dangerous than texting because\n\n03:44.240 --> 03:50.800\nthat must take two hands to do that no no less like Aaron was driving with me you can ask her\n\n03:50.800 --> 03:56.880\nI with this you can just around my back committed aggravated vehicular man manslaughter I'm not\n\n03:56.880 --> 04:03.280\ngonna defend any of my behavior I just but I will tell you that this is this was safer while\n\n04:03.280 --> 04:07.720\ndriving than than texting none of which is safe you shouldn't be doing anything but drive while\n\n04:07.720 --> 04:16.120\nyou're driving and and loving all races and sexual orientations and and and invading Syria\n\n04:16.120 --> 04:24.000\nall right just just some things to knock out Dan how do you feel about Syria you know I we got\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:28.840\nto get in there and see what's what's going on just you know right now it's like Schrodinger's\n\n04:28.840 --> 04:33.520\ncountry I mean is there are they a threat or not there's only one way to find out open the\n\n04:33.520 --> 04:41.160\nbox I don't I don't know man but but if they are Schrodinger's country and we open it up and\n\n04:41.160 --> 04:48.760\nthey're not a threat you know the witch sunk you know the old the old witch thing you know you\n\n04:48.760 --> 04:54.360\nthrow the lady in the water okay she floats she's a witch if she sank but shit they don't\n\n04:54.360 --> 05:00.360\nthink they don't sink we just drown right yeah I think I think I think if you look up drowning\n\n05:00.360 --> 05:06.840\nin the dictionary it will say like sinking as a human you know human bodies float after they\n\n05:06.840 --> 05:13.320\nafter they drown because they fill up with gas oh boy I think I think for the part that's killing\n\n05:13.320 --> 05:18.960\nyou you're underwater otherwise otherwise you're not a witch because you sink to the bottom of\n\n05:18.960 --> 05:24.120\nthe lake no that's if you're not a witch you drown right that was the whole point of that yeah\n\n05:24.120 --> 05:33.480\nlike what I okay here's the thing that I wanted to talk to you about because you had a list I\n\n05:33.480 --> 05:38.640\nhave my favorite thing to start with but you once you fit what I want to go right into your\n\n05:38.640 --> 05:49.360\nproblem with premium gas I don't have a problem I have a question is it is it am I should I be\n\n05:49.360 --> 05:55.560\ngetting premium gas is there any is it just a scam for just rich people is it do you own or\n\n05:55.560 --> 06:09.960\nlease your car I own it then buy premium gas it makes your engine better it's like Sesame Street\n\n06:09.960 --> 06:15.240\nin here but you know it but more but instead of talking about the harm return audiences is asked\n\n06:15.240 --> 06:22.000\nto fight it as Congress is about Syria right how many aren't decided on Syria and on premium gas\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:32.600\nright now I think there's probably a stone that could kill both of those birds or a missile\n\n06:32.600 --> 06:40.560\nyeah yeah who considers himself a sort of expert on this issue like mechanics on a gasoline\n\n06:40.560 --> 06:46.760\nwhatever about the premium gas thing that's Syria okay nobody no well do we have a Syria\n\n06:46.760 --> 06:53.200\nokay I got a hand shooting up in the middle are you sort of a gas gas would you be willing to\n\n06:53.200 --> 07:05.600\ncome up here for just a moment okay premium gas segment this is the premium gas segment you\n\n07:05.600 --> 07:10.920\ncan grab one of those mics what's your name sir I'm Gabe Gabe all right thank you for joining us\n\n07:10.920 --> 07:17.280\nhere at the Harmontown meeting so what did you learn about premium gas so I learned that my car\n\n07:17.280 --> 07:21.440\ntakes premium gas and I have to put it in or something goes wrong with my car what kind of\n\n07:21.440 --> 07:28.760\ncar do you have I have an Acura it's an old Acura and you and really it needs premium gas so if it\n\n07:28.760 --> 07:34.560\nsays requires premium then you have to put it in if they say recommends premium then you can put a\n\n07:34.560 --> 07:41.040\nlower octane in and it still works like the engine will adjust to it all right so I have I have a\n\n07:41.040 --> 07:47.240\nPrius does it say it requires premium I didn't look it up it probably doesn't right no so you\n\n07:47.240 --> 07:51.080\ndon't need to put in premium all right it's like the engine is tuned for whatever octane that they\n\n07:51.080 --> 07:55.760\nsay I think the big selling point was you barely need to put in any gas it's got a big battery in\n\n07:55.760 --> 08:01.600\nit I mean putting any gas in it you have to put in gas some yeah I mean yeah always there has to be\n\n08:01.600 --> 08:05.920\nsome gas so some in there it gets alarmed when there's not in there yeah aren't you gonna get a\n\n08:05.920 --> 08:10.960\nTesla at some point I look at the Tesla is like I think it's like 500 grand and there's a waiting\n\n08:10.960 --> 08:16.720\nlist I can't 60 grand 60 grand yeah there's models that there's levels of Tesla well I don't want the\n\n08:16.720 --> 08:24.880\nTesla coach the Tesla economy because like a little a little golf cart but it's technically a\n\n08:24.880 --> 08:29.760\nTesla 60 or 80 depending on how much you spend all right well so I say I have to research it more\n\n08:29.760 --> 08:37.920\nif it's if it's under a hundred grand like I might celebrate like the no no no I'm no if it's if\n\n08:37.920 --> 08:42.720\nit's under a hundred and yeah no I would I would I would think about it again because I've had my\n\n08:42.720 --> 08:47.080\nI've had my car for a long time this is taking this is taking a horrible direction premium gas is\n\n08:47.080 --> 08:50.240\nsomething that everyone can relate to listening to me talk about what car I want to buy next is\n\n08:50.240 --> 08:55.920\nthat's that's bad entertainment all right well thank you Gabe you want to plug your new book\n\n08:55.920 --> 09:03.280\nit's your book I'm reading your book okay all right your book all right the game everybody\n\n09:03.280 --> 09:14.440\ngas knowledge Gabe gas gas Dave premium premium Gabe all right boy I hit you with a tornado of\n\n09:14.440 --> 09:21.400\ntopics and you just latched onto the worst like the most mundane it's funny when you get attached\n\n09:21.400 --> 09:27.080\nto the mundane because you live in a rarefied realm of craziness that when you get bogged down\n\n09:27.080 --> 09:32.240\nwith you know plumbing or that your gas that's funny here's the thing I'd like to talk to you\n\n09:32.240 --> 09:37.400\nabout and I'd like to workshop this idea with you can we talk about the fact that backstage\n\n09:37.400 --> 09:42.840\nright before we came on and we don't talk about a lot before the show starts Dan was singing the\n\n09:42.840 --> 09:48.440\nmilk milk lemonade yeah and he said Jeff what is the chain what was your question there what's\n\n09:48.440 --> 09:52.360\nthe button what's the button the push the button pull the chain I know the chains your dick someone\n\n09:52.360 --> 09:57.600\nelse asked what the chain is yeah Spencer asked what the belly button is your button and Spencer said\n\n09:57.600 --> 10:02.800\nwhat's the chain is your dick right now I think Aaron said what's the chain oh yeah maybe it's\n\n10:02.800 --> 10:08.000\nSpencer Spencer I thought that I thought the button might have been a nipple but then when you\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:14.080\nsaid it was your belly button that made more sense because that might make me poop pushing pushing the\n\n10:14.080 --> 10:20.000\nbelly button and then pulling my dick like because that's never happened before whereas lots of\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:25.600\npeople have touched my nipple with it you prefer to your penis as a little purple choo choo train\n\n10:25.600 --> 10:39.600\nbefore oh yeah well all aboard I'm not all one at one at a time no I want to talk to you Jeff\n\n10:39.600 --> 10:47.520\nabout okay so you know okay so I was in bed today all day with my lover Erin McGathy like not\n\n10:47.520 --> 10:51.920\ndoing anything sexy or anything like doing something that we love to do which is sit and\n\n10:51.920 --> 10:58.840\nwatch movies and eat pizza that might embarrass her because she would rather you think that we\n\n10:58.840 --> 11:04.400\nwere sitting in bed lifting weights or something but or making love well she would probably love\n\n11:04.400 --> 11:09.320\nfor you to think that too yeah I've been I don't need you to have that mental image I'd rather you\n\n11:09.320 --> 11:13.760\nsee me like like sitting in bed with one of those like back pillow I was watching you guys eat\n\n11:13.760 --> 11:21.160\npizza in bed fuck yeah yeah it's the best relationship ever and love that is something\n\n11:21.160 --> 11:25.760\nI've never done I've never had a pizza a while in bed oh man I've never eaten a pizza supine\n\n11:25.760 --> 11:32.480\nbefore welcome welcome to every Sunday hit at Dan adieu yeah we just we see we wake up and then\n\n11:32.480 --> 11:39.120\nwe roll over and grab the remote and there's a there's a flat panel on the wall and then you\n\n11:39.120 --> 11:45.120\njust like go to the Apple TV I mean this is just unrepentant and do you grab hub who gets out of\n\n11:45.120 --> 11:50.280\nshe gets she she grubs the hub yeah the grub 24 the she who gets out of bed to actually get the\n\n11:50.280 --> 11:55.880\npizza from the front door or just the grub hub gentlemen come in and get in bed with you there's\n\n11:55.880 --> 12:03.160\nan extra pillow for him and he has to watch die hard too with you whoever whoever's got pajama\n\n12:03.160 --> 12:08.600\nbottoms on at the time there's a negotiation you know people get each other water aspirin things\n\n12:08.600 --> 12:15.040\nso anyway so Aaron gets it so no I usually I usually do the hunting and gathering thank you\n\n12:15.040 --> 12:24.560\nthe I was thinking neither hunting nor gathering it's all relative to a sedentary lifestyle like\n\n12:24.560 --> 12:28.920\nthat is the most hunting and gathering that's gonna get done this way I'm surprised you even\n\n12:28.920 --> 12:33.280\nhave the energy and the fortitude to put your little eye harmin around your neck in the morning\n\n12:33.280 --> 12:41.120\nand I like that to me seems like a physical exertion for you yeah it's not easy so I was\n\n12:41.120 --> 12:48.840\ngetting out of bed today to come to do the show yes that's how long we we stayed in bed we had a\n\n12:48.840 --> 12:55.640\nperfect Sunday we watched some Ryan Gosling crap and ate some pizza and there is no such thing as\n\n12:55.640 --> 13:06.400\nRyan Gosling crap so some movie about him where he says very little has lazy eyes and drives a\n\n13:06.400 --> 13:14.960\nvehicle to to moody needle drops and I just described for Ryan Gosling that's that's the only\n\n13:14.960 --> 13:20.760\nthree I've seen yeah I could narrow it down by tattoos I could go like oh it's the one where\n\n13:20.760 --> 13:28.600\nthe hamburgers on his bicep so but I could not narrow it down by saying it's the one that\n\n13:28.600 --> 13:36.840\ndissolves to like synth music as he proceeds to down an autumn an autumn leaf festooned\n\n13:36.840 --> 13:42.720\ncountry highway that's that that's you still got three movies to guess from that all right\n\n13:42.720 --> 13:50.760\nshut up getting getting out of bed to come to the show I was I was overcome with the sensation\n\n13:50.760 --> 13:54.320\nthat I'm sure we've all had which is that I would rather stay in bed not no offense to these\n\n13:54.320 --> 13:58.400\npeople or the show like I'm glad I'm here now because I get to talk about this but I was thinking\n\n13:58.400 --> 14:05.760\non the drive here and wrote down in my pad while going 40 miles an hour down sunset that like okay\n\n14:05.760 --> 14:10.280\nso and please workshop this with me I'm not presenting this as a thing that I know is gonna\n\n14:10.280 --> 14:15.400\nwork and I don't want I don't want all your little hole pokers coming out and poking holes in this I\n\n14:15.400 --> 14:22.160\nwant you to build something with me it's called brainstorming it's called yes and work on this\n\n14:22.160 --> 14:27.280\nwith me it's not it's not gonna sound foolproof immediately it's not gonna it's gonna gonna\n\n14:27.280 --> 14:33.680\nnestle perfectly within our our society but it might be something build society around so do you\n\n14:33.680 --> 14:43.120\nknow how the Amish have that what do they call it ramen sprung and things yes you know Google it\n\n14:43.120 --> 14:50.440\nI'm sure you know they they're they're Amish and then like on there you know when they become\n\n14:50.440 --> 14:58.040\nadolescent Amish people and then the Amish Hive says to them like go go be not Amish for summer\n\n14:58.040 --> 15:03.880\nit doesn't matter I don't care but they have it today I'm not saying that I don't know anything\n\n15:03.880 --> 15:07.880\nabout it I don't care I just know that they go off and they be not Amish for a while it's their\n\n15:07.880 --> 15:12.320\nchance to decide whether they want to come back into the fold did you become Amish in the drive\n\n15:12.320 --> 15:17.840\nhere just thinking about that in relation to my bed experience where I don't I didn't I wanted to\n\n15:17.840 --> 15:27.920\nI wanted to stay in bed so so I don't know like working title bed bed sprung in okay it's like I'm\n\n15:27.920 --> 15:35.360\nriffing here like help me workshop it I don't I'm just bad pitch and let's build on this once a month\n\n15:35.360 --> 15:42.200\nthe the the the worker at Harmontown they're the average citizen whoever you are there's no\n\n15:42.200 --> 15:49.160\nhierarchies the person a Harmontown citizen you you're in bed and you you have to stay in bed\n\n15:49.160 --> 16:04.120\nuntil you can't stand being in bed anymore that's it that's called depression staying in bed is\n\n16:04.120 --> 16:10.320\ncalled depression getting out of bed is called enthusiasm that's called recovery yeah and it's\n\n16:10.320 --> 16:15.280\ngood yes it's it's also called rebirth and recalibration of your of your mind and spirit like\n\n16:15.280 --> 16:20.680\nyou're going I'm getting out of bed for a reason and so I'm always how we all are always getting\n\n16:20.680 --> 16:26.520\nout of bed against our most fervent wishes usually how many how often are you leaping out of bed\n\n16:26.520 --> 16:31.480\nfor me when it rains when it's raining outside I love I can't wait to be out in the rain my\n\n16:31.480 --> 16:37.080\ngirlfriend hates the rain because she's Scottish we have like we're totally different she'd rather\n\n16:37.080 --> 16:43.960\nnever go outside when it rains for me I've heard pitterpats of rain I must be outside yeah okay\n\n16:43.960 --> 16:55.040\nI said I'm saying there are instances when it's good to be out of bed yeah yeah yeah I was just\n\n16:55.040 --> 16:59.000\nproposing this idea Jeff that people have to stay in bed why don't we why don't they realize\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:02.400\nthat they want to get out of bed why don't you it would be when it started to rain why don't\n\n17:02.400 --> 17:06.440\nyou make community so successful that we can build a bedroom big enough that we could do\n\n17:06.440 --> 17:15.480\nHarmontown in your bedroom each audience member could have a bed now you're talking about a cult\n\n17:15.480 --> 17:25.680\nbut yeah well you know the difference between a cult and a society is you know longevity\n\n17:25.680 --> 17:34.840\nsolvency success you know talk to you about a 200 year old cult called America that worked out\n\n17:34.840 --> 17:44.680\njust fine until recently all right so I mean obviously you're not gonna help me work make\n\n17:44.680 --> 17:53.240\nthat idea work and we'll get back to us in 200 years what are we gonna do for Halloween look last\n\n17:53.240 --> 18:01.520\nyear we all dressed up as Jareth from labyrinth I spent a lot of money on that costume I'm coming\n\n18:01.520 --> 18:08.600\nas Jareth again all right I mean unless look Halloween is one of those three four day long\n\n18:08.600 --> 18:13.200\nlike experiences where you can dress up as a cowboy one night and a sexy fireman the other night\n\n18:13.200 --> 18:17.480\nand then like and then we can all dress up as whatever but I'm one of those nights I'm fucking\n\n18:17.480 --> 18:24.920\nJareth again don't you think it's nice when we all at Harmontown dress as something all\n\n18:24.920 --> 18:32.800\nDavid Bowie different Bowie like a different what's your pitch my pitch my pitch is all\n\n18:32.800 --> 18:42.280\nSpencer's I don't like that because you said that in front of Spencer Spencer didn't look\n\n18:42.280 --> 18:46.320\npleased about that here's some other things Spencer doesn't look pleased when you say\n\n18:46.320 --> 18:57.760\nSpencer is not just pleased by everything Spencer doesn't need a bunch of people to come in at\n\n18:57.760 --> 19:02.880\nBeards and lumberjack shirts and shorts I'm not doing it for him I know that's why it's a bad idea\n\n19:02.880 --> 19:12.480\nso we should not do things that one person is gonna be upset dressing like a person that is not\n\n19:12.480 --> 19:21.200\na an actual iconic figure if we leave here if we leave the sexy confines of meltdown and we go\n\n19:21.200 --> 19:26.160\nout to a bar afterwards we're dressed as Spencer we just look like like people in bad Beards and\n\n19:26.160 --> 19:31.320\nponytails and then that doesn't doesn't resonate anymore and my concern is that two things one\n\n19:31.320 --> 19:36.120\nSpencer doesn't like the fact that we're all either paying tribute or mocking him in some way\n\n19:36.120 --> 19:41.840\nand the second thing we go somewhere else and we look homeless I mean that's kind of a yeah\n\n19:41.840 --> 19:50.680\npretty like one-two backhanded kidney punch the quality of Spencer's beard you cannot get at a\n\n19:50.680 --> 19:55.360\nbeard store there's no such thing as a place you're gonna get as a shitty fucking Hollywood\n\n19:55.360 --> 20:03.200\nBoulevard Hammurabi looking shitty beard and you cannot get a wig as sexy as his long metal hair\n\n20:03.200 --> 20:09.920\nthat he's neatly confined into a into a mysterious ponytail then you got to get the right glasses and\n\n20:09.920 --> 20:16.240\nthen nobody really has this build and so like what it's just gonna look like bad mimicry which I\n\n20:16.240 --> 20:23.000\nthink doesn't do anybody any service all right so your pitch is just to do Jareth again no no I'm\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:27.920\nsaying I'd be ever paying something else I don't think we should we should all mimic one of our\n\n20:27.920 --> 20:33.160\nfriends that wouldn't resonate to the rest of the world also hard to look like Spencer you have a\n\n20:33.160 --> 20:37.080\nfucking like you're closer because you already have kind of a beard and like you don't have a\n\n20:37.080 --> 20:41.040\nSpencer beard but you what's the end game with the rest of the world we're gonna you like the idea\n\n20:41.040 --> 20:44.960\nof going to a bar and having everyone go why are you all Mickey Mouse and we go weird because\n\n20:44.960 --> 20:50.560\nwe're friends let's say we're gonna be here we're gonna be here for two hours then we're gonna\n\n20:50.560 --> 20:54.600\nprobably want to go somewhere else and we're gonna have to explain everybody oh we're that guy\n\n20:54.600 --> 21:06.280\nand he's gonna go hmm I don't care that happened who knows man the whole night is gonna be on him\n\n21:06.280 --> 21:12.320\nto deal with why we all dressed like him it's gonna I think would be embarrassing for Spencer\n\n21:12.320 --> 21:19.560\nokay so what is it about Spencer is it about the reaction of the bartender first and foremost or\n\n21:19.560 --> 21:24.080\nis it about accuracy of costume or is it because you think Spencer looks homeless no those are\n\n21:24.080 --> 21:28.240\nthose have been thrown out I'm picturing my best attempt at looking like Spencer and I'm gonna\n\n21:28.240 --> 21:33.160\nlook like a shitty Spencer and that's not gonna nobody wins at that point all right first and\n\n21:33.160 --> 21:37.800\nforemost I think Spencer is the concern and then not because he gives a shit but I think that\n\n21:37.800 --> 21:44.440\nthat's a burden okay all right this has been great the the it's automatically entertaining for\n\n21:44.440 --> 21:50.120\nwas one person suggest something the other person says no like it's a this is a half hour of this\n\n21:50.120 --> 21:56.280\nso far I think it's a bad idea okay all right and tell me why you think it's a good idea I think\n\n21:56.280 --> 22:06.360\nit's a good idea because I'll take 10 what I don't what are you doing right now what are you\n\n22:06.360 --> 22:14.760\nI'm joking you're what I mean what I'm what I'm suggesting to you is that you're absolutely no value\n\n22:14.760 --> 22:20.160\nadd to you explaining why something shouldn't be done and you also didn't have a very good first\n\n22:20.160 --> 22:25.200\npitch which was the idea of recycling your expensive Halloween that was also a joke I'm\n\n22:25.200 --> 22:30.240\nout of laziness I would do that but let's think of another one I don't I you don't get a second\n\n22:30.240 --> 22:35.200\nmotion from for the Spencer thing from me I mean does anybody else that I want everyone do we all\n\n22:35.200 --> 22:43.000\nwant to come and spend no no no we're moving on all right that's 15 minutes of someone saying no\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:49.560\nto somebody about something it's that's the long enough I got another hour and a half of me all\n\n22:49.560 --> 22:53.760\nright my garage smells like mildew and we'll save that for next week let's put let's put that down\n\n22:53.760 --> 22:56.360\non the road I'm gonna ask for some volunteers we're gonna go in there and clean it up that's\n\n22:56.360 --> 23:02.800\nI think I may need glasses I had to skip an optometry appointment I'm 40 years old I think\n\n23:02.800 --> 23:07.440\nit's just come become that time for me to have glasses I'm afraid I don't know I was looking at\n\n23:07.440 --> 23:14.280\nthe billboards coming in here I can't tell a Vince Vaughn from a grand theft auto character\n\n23:14.280 --> 23:20.720\nanymore you are holding your eye harm in closer and closer yeah yeah it's a thing I don't know\n\n23:20.720 --> 23:26.840\nyeah so we got which is a new segment new segment tonight tell me what kind of music\n\n23:26.840 --> 23:31.680\ntheme you think you want something downbeat funky old school something do you have something\n\n23:31.680 --> 23:41.040\nprovincial so I can find out what that word means when I hear it I'll pick a province and\n\n23:41.040 --> 23:46.600\nI'll go with it this segment is called Erin McGathy asks questions about the grand theft\n\n23:46.600 --> 23:56.680\nauto 5 billboard\n\n23:56.680 --> 24:10.080\nso we were driving down sunset and you saw a big a big billboard for grand theft auto 5\n\n24:10.080 --> 24:15.200\nwhich is coming out this month yeah and you had some questions about the about it about the\n\n24:15.200 --> 24:21.560\nbillboard yeah who is that guy he's just a guy that you can play in grand theft auto 5 I'm\n\n24:21.560 --> 24:26.120\nassuming okay is he a special guy because he's just wearing a polo shirt he's just a guy he's\n\n24:26.120 --> 24:30.720\none he's a guy that you'll be able to play in grand theft auto 5 he's not currently famous\n\n24:30.720 --> 24:35.000\nwithin the grand theft auto universe so then why is he on the advertisement why am I driving down\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:41.520\nthe street and I see a giant guy because Christian Bale isn't in the game and it's just a they're\n\n24:41.520 --> 24:46.920\njust in the grand theft auto 5 audience is built in and so they're just reminding you oh this huge\n\n24:46.920 --> 24:51.200\nvideo game is coming out with a new release and here's our stylistic kind of is he supposed to\n\n24:51.200 --> 24:57.720\nbe a real person I'm really distracted by Tyler raising his hands we're actually just repeating\n\n24:57.720 --> 25:02.400\nour conversation from before yeah this is yeah I mean there's no I don't know what you you know\n\n25:02.400 --> 25:12.400\nyou just want to raise your hand now they're doing their conversation again full boy you guys are the worst\n\n25:12.400 --> 25:23.200\nI wish the segment is the best day of my life Aaron's Aaron's questions about the grand theft\n\n25:23.200 --> 25:28.080\nauto billboard yeah and just to let you guys behind the curtain a little bit we have this\n\n25:28.080 --> 25:32.880\nconversation so that's the bit okay so all right but it's not a not that I ever stopped it with\n\n25:32.880 --> 25:37.520\nthis is the best conversation of the world we should have it again I just wanted you to ask\n\n25:37.520 --> 25:43.960\nyour questions okay okay so here are my real questions um so okay sorry now I'm in my head\n\n25:43.960 --> 25:49.480\num but these I'm gonna think about the actual way that I feel about this billboard so he's\n\n25:49.480 --> 25:54.560\njust holding a bunch of money it's grand theft auto 5 right yeah I don't know why I said it said it\n\n25:54.560 --> 26:00.520\nthat way grand theft auto 5 um it's grand theft auto 5 so when it why is there not like a special\n\n26:00.520 --> 26:05.480\ncharacter on the billboard why is the billboard just like my dentist he's a guy that likes to\n\n26:05.480 --> 26:11.320\nsteal cars put your hand down Tyler it doesn't don't you understand the question her the answers\n\n26:11.320 --> 26:17.280\ndon't matter no they're not they're not rhetorical but the answers don't matter this is what she\n\n26:17.280 --> 26:22.720\ndoesn't understand is that grand theft auto 5 could put a fucking turd on a billboard and say\n\n26:22.720 --> 26:27.280\nremember to buy grand theft auto 5 and I keep explaining that to her it doesn't matter like\n\n26:27.280 --> 26:32.080\nwhen the Batman 9 movie comes out they're not gonna they don't they don't go like all right make\n\n26:32.080 --> 26:38.280\nsure that we show Batman doing something awesome but he's definitely like in a shadow or he's at\n\n26:38.280 --> 26:42.160\nleast wearing his bat outfit just to let you know that there's a Batman movie that's all they care\n\n26:42.160 --> 26:46.720\nabout okay so Tyler this is a real question about grand theft auto um so that man in the\n\n26:46.720 --> 26:57.200\npolo he's a man we know but he's not he's he's not a man we know okay exactly so he's just a\n\n26:57.200 --> 27:12.640\nman wearing a polo shirt okay so so so Laura's Lauren someone just called her racist for saying\n\n27:12.640 --> 27:19.680\nthat he looks like all the characters in the game okay so is the idea that it's like oh yeah\n\n27:19.680 --> 27:26.080\nthey're back at it again we have a white man in a polo shirt yeah my favorite video game company\n\n27:26.080 --> 27:31.960\nis making my favorite video game again yeah it's like like yeah it's like a guy just any guy like\n\n27:31.960 --> 27:37.720\nit might have been a woman in a bikini like well what I was saying earlier is like you like I would\n\n27:37.720 --> 27:43.880\nall I mean even though it's it's it's so misogynist I was like where are the girls and the with the\n\n27:43.880 --> 27:49.240\ngiant crazy pumpkin breasts like why why is it just this man and this polo shirt holding a bunch of\n\n27:49.240 --> 27:52.760\ncash I've never played the game but from what I know they're probably being raped by a car right\n\n27:52.760 --> 27:58.440\nyeah exactly so which is why people play that game right or no I know that's not why you play\n\n27:58.440 --> 28:04.320\nthe game by the way you guys are I feel like you guys are being really mean or weird or not not\n\n28:04.320 --> 28:18.880\nmean not mean I mean all right look look there's only one way to resolve this I feel silly about\n\n28:18.880 --> 28:24.280\nthis now we have to have a new segment called Tyler's answers about Grand Theft Auto he's\n\n28:24.280 --> 28:31.160\ngonna he's going to explode okay well then I and I have actual questions I have actual questions\n\n28:31.160 --> 28:37.680\nokay so in every Grand Theft Auto game is it always just it's just a generic looking man with\n\n28:37.680 --> 28:41.560\na polo shirt there's a new protagonist in every game and that's not what I asked in the other games\n\n28:41.560 --> 28:47.600\nlike is it is it just always men and polos no okay what are the men what are the heroes usually\n\n28:47.600 --> 28:53.880\nin Grant in the previous one it was a guy from the Eastern block his name was Nico okay he kind\n\n28:53.880 --> 28:59.160\nof played an immigrant you were new to America he was in New York he was kind of trying to leave\n\n28:59.160 --> 29:02.680\nhis old life behind but it caught up with him and he did that again so is the pure purpose of\n\n29:02.680 --> 29:08.040\nthe bulbar to be like we're back to a white guy like honestly don't know the purpose of back to\n\n29:08.040 --> 29:12.720\nwhat are they pulling back from like a special there's three guys in the new game there's dude\n\n29:12.720 --> 29:18.360\nin polo shirt there's a dude coming out of the hood trying to leave the old hood mentality behind\n\n29:18.360 --> 29:24.040\ncrazy guy who is kind of a psychopath there's the three things and they're like let's all get\n\n29:24.040 --> 29:27.960\ntogether and do heists that's the that's the point behind the new one do you how do they know each\n\n29:27.960 --> 29:33.960\nother I don't know what I'm playing the game you seem to know a lot about this from the marketing\n\n29:33.960 --> 29:37.960\nmaterial they Aaron are you asking these questions because you want to get into Grand Theft Auto\n\n29:37.960 --> 29:42.000\nis this anything or are you just you're pretty I mean I'm pretty sure Grand Theft Auto would\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:47.800\nmake me cry it's really it's I know I don't want to get it's not that bad well I mean I don't like\n\n29:47.800 --> 29:58.000\nfevery okay well that is a big part of the grand theft auto-games yes stealing I respect other people's property you know like\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:05.560\nI don't like running over people well I mean with each new release there are more and more non-criminal\n\n30:05.560 --> 30:10.960\nelements you could focus on you can go to a bowling alley that's what I was asking before like him\n\n30:10.960 --> 30:14.560\njust holding the cash if I didn't know what it was I'd be like oh this guy just got back from the\n\n30:14.560 --> 30:22.240\nbank oh man he's going to apply for his mother's loan what you seriously you're like you look at the\n\n30:22.240 --> 30:27.160\nbillboard like oh man that guy went to chase and withdrew $2,000 you know what is he doing is he buying\n\n30:27.160 --> 30:35.720\na pool not seriously what not literally I'm just literally the way that it so okay so more more\n\n30:35.720 --> 30:40.400\nquestions have there ever been has there ever been like a and I'm not saying this defensively\n\n30:40.400 --> 30:45.440\nbut has there ever been a female like marauder there has never been a female protagonist in a\n\n30:45.440 --> 30:52.280\ngrand theft auto or any game by the people who made that game no okay okay um so so these polo\n\n30:52.280 --> 31:00.520\npeople no they actually had actual polo players where there was like guys that were like playing\n\n31:00.520 --> 31:14.400\ngames to the one that came out where we had the guy in New York they were kind of time pieces so\n\n31:14.400 --> 31:19.080\nlike you had one that was set in the 80s and one that was set in the 90s so they were kind of\n\n31:19.080 --> 31:22.960\ndifferent characters now they've kind of gone like genre you totally there were genre pieces like\n\n31:22.960 --> 31:29.680\nthis is an 80s film but there's never gonna be one in 19th century England picture good Jane\n\n31:29.680 --> 31:38.160\nAustin you're not on the agenda why don't you step outside and let me take this guy if you\n\n31:38.160 --> 31:45.520\nguys play great grand theft handsome cab yeah so is the idea do you think the idea of the game is\n\n31:45.520 --> 31:52.040\nthat the these men are normal men because you're like oh I could be I could I could be the thief\n\n31:52.040 --> 32:00.080\nmaybe what's the word I'm looking for it but the car stealers their word for that criminal thief well\n\n32:00.080 --> 32:07.000\nI didn't know if there was like burglar or I don't know whatever dumb question I think as I think as\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:13.280\ntechnology increases and these computer systems have more memory and hard drive space and the\n\n32:13.280 --> 32:19.960\nchips are faster blah blah blah the more they allow for simulation of reality the easiest\n\n32:19.960 --> 32:26.920\nway to celebrate that newfound power is to sort of deconstruct not so much reality like I which I\n\n32:26.920 --> 32:32.840\nthink that violent video games are mistaken for like oh let's let's take reality and do horrible\n\n32:32.840 --> 32:36.320\nviolent fantasies with them I think it's more deconstruction of what you've previously been\n\n32:36.320 --> 32:43.760\nable to do within video games like I grew up on pole position where you just like if you go off\n\n32:43.760 --> 32:48.840\nthe road your car turns into eight more pixels and you're told that you you lost and so the\n\n32:48.840 --> 32:54.440\nexhilarating power of being able to hit the F key and get out of your car run over to another one\n\n32:54.440 --> 32:59.280\nhit the F key again at which point your character opens that guy's car door pulls him out punches him\n\n32:59.280 --> 33:03.360\nin the face throws him away and gets in that car that's like it's not so much like I always wished\n\n33:03.360 --> 33:08.560\nI could do that it's like I always I was I'm so glad this video game is allowing me to see more of\n\n33:08.560 --> 33:20.760\nthe world and I gotta say I'm not trying to score points here but I have a I like I am very\n\n33:20.760 --> 33:26.440\nhandicapped in these games by my absolute like I have a very difficult time crossing the threshold\n\n33:26.440 --> 33:30.720\nrate where like people are being victimized like like even though they're kind of like randomly\n\n33:30.720 --> 33:36.960\ngenerated like people thanks baby there's always comes a point when you do cross that\n\n33:36.960 --> 33:40.600\nthreshold on accident like you've just sort of someone gets in the way and you hit him with a\n\n33:40.600 --> 33:47.400\nbat and then and then you're like oh I'm fine and then it starts to become it's like by the time\n\n33:47.400 --> 33:51.240\nyou're done playing those games you're kind of like exploring every horrible masochistic I don't\n\n33:51.240 --> 33:55.320\nhave flashbacks when I play Grand Theft Auto like oh man I shouldn't have clubbed that hooker I don't\n\n33:55.320 --> 34:19.320\nknow if there's not anything more pressing we got other segments to cover is that okay yeah you\n\n34:19.320 --> 34:24.960\nthink you got it under control now any other really pressing questions about the billboard\n\n34:24.960 --> 34:28.560\nnothing Aaron are you just like is there a concern in your mind that you're gonna lose\n\n34:28.560 --> 34:33.320\nDan to this game that you don't understand like like no no that won't happen I can't I can't go\n\n34:33.320 --> 34:38.160\nnear this thing until December then we're going to Scotland I can't I'm not gonna I'm gonna miss\n\n34:38.160 --> 34:43.200\nout on Grand Theft Auto 5 it'll be there when you get back down you know you could I'll dress up\n\n34:43.200 --> 34:49.640\nlike like a lady of the night I'll make you a little card can I give you can I give you five\n\n34:49.640 --> 34:55.840\nfive weird catchphrases to just say what are the catch what are the catchphrases looking good sugar\n\n34:55.840 --> 35:08.440\nwhat's happening that boy be trippin hey hey you want a party and stop stealing that car for a\n\n35:08.440 --> 35:15.840\nshort time I was a for a summer in LA I was a tutor for kids in the eighth grade who are wanting\n\n35:15.840 --> 35:21.080\nto get into private high schools and English tutor and the kid that I was that I was tutoring\n\n35:21.080 --> 35:25.920\nor supposed to tutor he got to have like a video game break and would just go and play Grand Theft\n\n35:25.920 --> 35:34.800\nAuto and just drive over people and he was a really shitty shitty shitty kid and that sounds\n\n35:34.800 --> 35:39.120\nlike a one-to-one correlation you're like oh if you're driving over kids and grab that thought it\n\n35:39.120 --> 35:44.760\nwasn't his fault that he was a shitty kid his he his his dad owned Jeopardy and a million other\n\n35:44.760 --> 35:55.360\nthings he lives in and I was griffin what you tutor Ted Griffin Damian Griffin that's a weird\n\n35:55.360 --> 36:01.880\ncorrelation I'm not has nothing to do with Jeopardy I'm just saying that he comes from a family with\n\n36:01.880 --> 36:07.240\na bazillion dollars and his parents don't pay attention to

I'll come back sevens off my own special way I'm a savior of humanity no\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:30.960\nI've as some of you been seeing on Twitter I spent the last six weeks although I will\n\n42:30.960 --> 42:36.240\nadmit I cheated and started before I was on the last episode but I've been drawing people\n\n42:36.240 --> 42:43.320\nfrom Harmontown as a Mega Man characters yeah I saw some of which is my favorite video game\n\n42:43.320 --> 42:49.240\nyou know take that Grand Theft Auto and yeah and and it's one of the few like really vivid\n\n42:49.240 --> 42:55.120\nchildhood memories I have not very not not the visuals of it but just I remember always\n\n42:55.120 --> 43:00.240\nbeing obsessed about it I think to the point where one day my mom my mom raised me and\n\n43:00.240 --> 43:04.440\nmy brother by herself and she went on a date one night and then she came home at two in\n\n43:04.440 --> 43:09.080\nthe morning and my brother was asleep and I turned my entire room into a level from\n\n43:09.080 --> 43:16.680\nMega Man and she she was mad and my brother was asleep and I'm like jumping on the beds\n\n43:16.680 --> 43:20.760\nlike shooting like at things at the wall that aren't moving what turning your room into\n\n43:20.760 --> 43:27.840\nany level from any video game and entail some tidiness like I miss Mega Man I'm a little\n\n43:27.840 --> 43:33.080\nolder than you it's like it's like Mario it's like side scroll and I guess so yeah there's\n\n43:33.080 --> 43:38.440\njust blocks floating in my room you made your room two-dimensional yes that's against a\n\n43:38.440 --> 43:45.280\nlot of building codes yeah so we didn't get the deposit back on the apartment but so I've\n\n43:45.280 --> 43:49.560\nbeen drawing people like and I didn't want to just draw you guys like I drew because\n\n43:49.560 --> 43:54.400\nthis show is you guys have all kind of whether you know it or not have kind of become like\n\n43:54.400 --> 43:59.600\nan extended family of mine and so I wanted to draw some of you too so I drew NT and\n\n43:59.600 --> 44:04.720\nAdam Goldberg and then I drew some of your guests I drew Dustin obviously and I spent\n\n44:04.720 --> 44:12.480\na lot of times had two nosebleeds and one blackout no seizures but I spent about seven\n\n44:12.480 --> 44:17.600\nweeks drawing all of these so I guess I was just curious if people were interested I was\n\n44:17.600 --> 44:21.320\nthinking about making prints and I ran the idea by Dan maybe make a very limited number\n\n44:21.320 --> 44:25.520\nof the prints and we could sell them here like before a show one night I don't know maybe\n\n44:25.520 --> 44:34.560\ntwo nosebleeds that's why if you look on Twitter I tweeted the original pictures and then\n\n44:34.560 --> 44:38.160\nlater you see them on completely different paper and it's because I had it I had to use\n\n44:38.160 --> 44:42.840\na lightbox to redraw it because I bled on the previous I mean that's not because of\n\n44:42.840 --> 44:49.360\nthe art right like it's because it's the amount of it takes to create something visual for\n\n44:49.360 --> 44:56.960\nme it takes a lot Adam well Jesus God I mean well that's I mean thank you I'm not saying\n\n44:56.960 --> 45:01.040\nI would normally bleed for Harmontown I'm just it just happened I wasn't expecting it\n\n45:01.040 --> 45:05.280\nit just happened what so what so what do we what do I have to pull the trigger on how\n\n45:05.280 --> 45:10.560\ndo we get how do we you wanted to come and talk about the stuff and announce it I mean\n\n45:10.560 --> 45:15.560\nI'm not I'm never sure because I got my head up my own ass what do I I see I see tweets\n\n45:15.560 --> 45:19.280\nfrom you and emails and stuff the answer is yes whatever you want to do do you want to\n\n45:19.280 --> 45:23.600\nyou want to sell these things on the Harmontown yeah I figured that we would maybe do\n\n45:23.600 --> 45:29.120\na batch for the group here and then you know and then and then like maybe just make like\n\n45:29.120 --> 45:33.120\nI don't know I don't know what a good number is maybe 30 or 50 or 100 and then anything\n\n45:33.120 --> 45:37.200\nwe have left over after we sell to anyone here we can put on the Harmontown store if\n\n45:37.200 --> 45:41.200\nyou want yeah I do can we give the money to the aneurysm foundation or we can I mean I\n\n45:41.200 --> 45:47.080\nreally need it if you needed this as good I mean I do but I I mean I'd rather my my\n\n45:47.080 --> 45:54.120\nmission my my self-given mission in life is to help them out so you know so I would I\n\n45:54.120 --> 45:59.120\nmean I originally I wanted to give it to fair audio but you guys were like this screw that\n\n45:59.120 --> 46:05.080\nI was like well I'll buy a shirt then just I can drink a couple as Red Bulls next month\n\n46:05.080 --> 46:10.920\nwe can cut corners in our little smoking room but we could do the yeah absolutely whatever\n\n46:10.920 --> 46:15.840\nyeah we could do that all right well whatever yeah we'll figure it out but but so I well\n\n46:15.840 --> 46:20.560\nhow have you been like what's the I mean I think that's the thing that's foremost on\n\n46:20.560 --> 46:29.080\nmy mind like when is the last time you had a like a report of your condition it's just\n\n46:29.080 --> 46:35.040\nlike you have this mysterious condition with an indefinite prognosis and I just like like\n\n46:35.040 --> 46:41.760\nwhat what what is what's going on when you talk to the doctors when what do you know\n\n46:41.760 --> 46:49.680\nabout well I mean we just I go in I do tests probably every week mostly but some of the\n\n46:49.680 --> 46:53.240\ntests are physical so sometimes they'll just have me run on a treadmill and see how long\n\n46:53.240 --> 46:58.600\nI can last and then sometimes it's blood work and sometimes it's CT scans or MRIs is there\n\n46:58.600 --> 47:04.960\nwater at the behind the treadmill yeah they're not getting an accurate result like a pull\n\n47:04.960 --> 47:10.480\nof sharks behind no yeah they're not I mean what so when what are they telling you anything\n\n47:10.480 --> 47:16.200\nare they just like right now it's I mean they usually tell me things when it gets bad but\n\n47:16.200 --> 47:21.040\nright now I mean I'm just on a monitored system so they just they're like it like we said\n\n47:21.040 --> 47:25.640\nlast time because I'm experiencing things differently than most they're they just keep\n\n47:25.640 --> 47:30.760\na close eye on me but because any anything can turn in my head at the last minute they\n\n47:30.760 --> 47:35.640\njust have to constantly keep an eye on me so that's so there's really no news is always\n\n47:35.640 --> 47:39.920\ngood news for me yeah so so it's also the weirdest news in the world because it's like\n\n47:39.920 --> 47:43.880\nthis coin flipping up in the air perpetually yeah it's like two faces just living in my\n\n47:43.880 --> 47:47.240\nhead the weird thing is it's a metaphor I like obviously that's that's that is all of\n\n47:47.240 --> 47:52.120\nour condition well of course like yeah yeah well no one tomorrow's not promised anybody\n\n47:52.120 --> 47:55.640\nyeah you just that's why I deal with it really well because I'm like oh you know so and so\n\n47:55.640 --> 48:00.880\nsome could happen to them tomorrow yeah you know so it's it's not but it's like frustrating\n\n48:00.880 --> 48:05.920\nto it's like like somebody say something somebody in a weight lab coach say something definitive\n\n48:05.920 --> 48:10.240\nanything they're probably wrong nine nine out of ten times anyway but someone what is\n\n48:10.240 --> 48:16.600\nwhat is it as it's like a weird Schrodinger's I mean it does but I I'd ever open the box\n\n48:16.600 --> 48:21.400\nI don't want to know like it's better not to know I think for me anyway because I have\n\n48:21.400 --> 48:26.120\nso much I'm trying to just live a normal life now so I put that first so I want to make\n\n48:26.120 --> 48:30.120\nsure I if I wake up in the morning that's step one I'm like all right cool I'm here\n\n48:30.120 --> 48:33.720\nso now what do I got to do I'm like okay so now I get a new job so that's been like that's\n\n48:33.720 --> 48:37.960\nwhy my head's been hurting a lot lately because the kind of the stress of it but I'm adapting\n\n48:37.960 --> 48:43.880\nnow so so things have kind of cooled off so it's I saw that we were talking about on\n\n48:43.880 --> 48:47.520\nthe subreddit the Harmontown subreddit you're active in there and I remember seeing you\n\n48:47.520 --> 48:51.520\nsaying something about how you probably shouldn't be one of the hundred to go to the moon because\n\n48:51.520 --> 48:57.560\nfor all you know what's happening is hereditary and yeah you could have 99 you know like next\n\n48:57.560 --> 49:03.240\nweek you know the week after we move but we can make it 101 and I also saw the if you\n\n49:03.240 --> 49:11.000\ncould be like a minister of fear of death for it for other people I could go to when\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:17.400\nI go I need glasses tell me tell me that that's not a big deal the but more importantly we\n\n49:17.400 --> 49:21.640\ntoyed around so I saw being toyed around the concept of you being the person that chooses\n\n49:21.640 --> 49:26.720\nthe 100 which I would be fine with I think you would choose better than me well yeah\n\n49:26.720 --> 49:33.600\nI mean I look at it's how I approach everything art writing like I look at things of who like\n\n49:33.600 --> 49:38.200\nI don't know I feel like that position should be someone that doesn't have an ultimate stake\n\n49:38.200 --> 49:43.720\nin it exactly so I thought oh someone who doesn't get to go to the moon colony should\n\n49:43.720 --> 49:48.440\nbe the one to pick the 100 right and I don't want to go by choice I want it to be a better\n\n49:48.440 --> 49:53.920\nsociety and I feel like a better society wouldn't have wouldn't have to wouldn't look at me\n\n49:53.920 --> 49:56.880\nas a burden you know like that's what I that's why I moved back here to LA because when I\n\n49:56.880 --> 50:00.960\nwas back home with my mom and recovering I think that's all she saw when she looked at\n\n50:00.960 --> 50:05.440\nme because there's a lot for her to process you know like that that I was mentally gone\n\n50:05.440 --> 50:10.400\nyou know that she was like oh my son doesn't remember things anymore so he's a he's there's\n\n50:10.400 --> 50:14.480\na part of them that's not my son anymore so I don't ever want to be a burden to anyone\n\n50:14.480 --> 50:18.840\nso I think that's why ultimately I was like oh I'll help pick the 100 and then and then\n\n50:18.840 --> 50:23.640\nI'll stay here and you guys are gonna need stuff constantly so I figured that'd be good\n\n50:23.640 --> 50:30.080\nfor me to be here at the teleporter you know guarding it and making sure supplies are still\n\n50:30.080 --> 50:32.760\ngetting to you because I feel like once you go up there with your hundred there's gonna\n\n50:32.760 --> 50:36.080\nbe a lot of disgruntled people down here going why didn't you choose me and they're gonna\n\n50:36.080 --> 50:42.000\nwant to cut you off and I feel like to seek about your problems exactly I feel like few\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:46.640\npeople will come up to me and go yeah here's some extra you know flower or whatever send\n\n50:46.640 --> 50:51.840\nthat to the but I think we could build a seek mannequin and have him down there in that\n\n50:51.840 --> 50:56.040\nwindow that says back for lunch and you could we could smuggle you up to the moon I think\n\n50:56.040 --> 51:01.000\nI'll visit I would like to visit my favorite comic book is a bunch of characters that live\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:05.800\non the moon they're called the inhumans so so yeah I love I'm fascinated the first image\n\n51:05.800 --> 51:09.520\nI saw when I would get out of the hospital was or when I was conscious of the hospital\n\n51:09.520 --> 51:13.280\nwas the moon because I woke up at night and I got to see this beautiful thing in the sky\n\n51:13.280 --> 51:17.840\nso I I was been drawn to this show because of these little things I feel like a such\n\n51:17.840 --> 51:21.120\nan amazing mythical thing the moon and I was like yeah it's been you're looking at you're\n\n51:21.120 --> 51:28.960\nlooking at the only thing that we looked at before we were even human yeah like it's\n\n51:28.960 --> 51:33.760\nbuilt into our you know insects like the reason we've talked about that before like the reason\n\n51:33.760 --> 51:38.480\nmoths go around sports like this because they're they're instinctively they evolved with the\n\n51:38.480 --> 51:42.320\nmoon in the sky and they use it as a navigator they keep it on their left side to fly in\n\n51:42.320 --> 51:45.600\na straight line and they get fucked by porch lights and campfires because they think that's\n\n51:45.600 --> 51:52.040\na moon and they like spiral to their death but what for us whether the creators of mythology\n\n51:52.040 --> 51:58.680\nwas this silver disc in the sky that changes shape it is always up there it is like synonymous\n\n51:58.680 --> 52:05.800\nin mythology with femininity the egg that the sperm strive for this this giant radiant\n\n52:05.800 --> 52:11.320\nthing up there this this cooling thing that has power over the tide this this monthly\n\n52:11.320 --> 52:19.200\nlunar like cycle it's like the most beautiful like fuck the sun it's garbage the sun will\n\n52:19.200 --> 52:25.160\ndie one day the moon is infinite the sun is murdering us every morning it comes up tries\n\n52:25.160 --> 52:31.680\nto kill us for 12 hours and goes back to sleep when the sun dies we go first I mean I'm not\n\n52:31.680 --> 52:35.560\nsaying the sun ain't got no power I'm just saying I refuse to negotiate with terrorists\n\n52:35.560 --> 52:42.680\nI know I know it's I know it's got its hand on the trigger but it's like fuck you spit\n\n52:42.680 --> 52:46.640\nyour face like you know like we have this you know like whatever you think about President\n\n52:46.640 --> 52:50.920\nObama I'm neither here nor there I don't like give a shit but like like he's in this pickle\n\n52:50.920 --> 52:54.200\nabout Syria I don't know why he thinks that we should go do this I think he's I think\n\n52:54.200 --> 52:57.600\nhe was lied to I think we're being lied to about I think it's all a bunch of baloney\n\n52:57.600 --> 53:03.280\nI think it's a bigger weirder task in hand that's my theory the pope the pope is on that\n\n53:03.280 --> 53:08.560\ncase too is there a pope said something I was just browsing around and I just see the headlines\n\n53:08.560 --> 53:11.880\nlike I'm really out of the loop about the Syria thing but I read a headline that said\n\n53:11.880 --> 53:17.880\nlike the pope the pope raises the question is Syria happening so that we can sell weapons\n\n53:17.880 --> 53:22.320\nis that what's going on really okay I mean yeah he's making a better case for Catholicism\n\n53:22.320 --> 53:27.880\nthan any pope ever because he likes like queers and stuff he's awesome or kind of he kind\n\n53:27.880 --> 53:33.240\nof does I mean as much as a pope I think he probably like deep down does but he knows\n\n53:33.240 --> 53:38.920\nwhat he can and can't say but has there been an apology from the the thing that the Catholic\n\n53:38.920 --> 53:43.440\nChurch needs to do is there needs to be an acknowledgement and apology about about all\n\n53:43.440 --> 53:52.560\nof the covering of the you know the shenanigans that's a real thing that actually needs to\n\n53:52.560 --> 53:56.960\nhappen is that has that happened I really don't know I know that they can't I mean\n\n53:56.960 --> 54:03.480\nyeah I'm sure they feel terrible about it some of them yeah it's not the thought that counts\n\n54:03.480 --> 54:12.480\nin this particular case by the time this podcast drops and tomorrow maybe not that President\n\n54:12.480 --> 54:17.600\nObama will be on every today show and morning news show making a case for some strange ass\n\n54:17.600 --> 54:23.120\nshit that just seems really like like a lot of malarkey no one knows what the what the\n\n54:23.120 --> 54:29.840\nyou know the the logic behind this JFK like we like he said let's go to the fucking moon\n\n54:29.840 --> 54:33.360\nand let's do it in 10 years and I'll be dead when that happens I'll be dead a couple years\n\n54:33.360 --> 54:39.120\nby the time that goes down you know he did he actually did know that that's why he said\n\n54:39.120 --> 54:44.760\nit because he was awesome but they built the biggest machine humans are likely to ever\n\n54:44.760 --> 54:50.400\nmake and they went to the moon and that's badass they lived in a magical crazy time and our\n\n54:50.400 --> 54:57.600\npresident we have to go do it like I drew a red line we're gonna do it a tactical straggle\n\n54:57.600 --> 55:02.320\nlimited boots in the grounds and it's like it's like boo fucking let's go to Mars let's\n\n55:02.320 --> 55:07.200\njust fucking let's just some cool human shit yeah the only thing that I yeah the only thing\n\n55:07.200 --> 55:11.920\nthat I know about it is or think about it is like what I read a long time ago and I might\n\n55:11.920 --> 55:20.880\nread my little Chomsky book which is just about you know it's like it just feels like we we America\n\n55:20.880 --> 55:26.240\nwas this kind of brutal capitalistic genius before we went into World War two and we had\n\n55:26.240 --> 55:32.960\nthis 50 year plan that we are now exiting we have now exited and we are we're trying to\n\n55:32.960 --> 55:38.640\nfigure out a new 50 year plan like America was whether you love it or hate it like we\n\n55:38.640 --> 55:45.600\nwere good if you're gonna be proud of something be proud of how we fucking like we we made this\n\n55:45.600 --> 55:50.560\ndecision that we were the Han Solo of the planet that we were I got no love for the empire but\n\n55:50.560 --> 55:55.760\nyou know and it wouldn't make a book kind of like we were we hung back and we didn't believe in the\n\n55:55.760 --> 56:00.640\nforce and we kept our blaster at our side and we we had our the Atlantic Ocean between us and\n\n56:00.640 --> 56:05.760\nany trouble and we just like we we just wanted to know what's in it for us and then we had this\n\n56:05.760 --> 56:10.960\n50 year thing that started with our involvement in World War two that turned out fine and dandy\n\n56:10.960 --> 56:16.240\nfor us and and and now we're living in the past the finish line of all that and I think\n\n56:16.240 --> 56:22.240\nyou know like we're there were there people were allowed to be more brutal back then they were\n\n56:22.240 --> 56:27.040\nallowed to be more secretive they were allowed to you know there were there was a what a quarter\n\n56:27.040 --> 56:33.120\nof the population back then at least half like like less people plain and simple half as many\n\n56:33.120 --> 56:40.240\nproblems and half as many ways to fuck up and but it was like now we're the you know Generation X\n\n56:40.240 --> 56:46.080\nis 40 and and the millennials are going what are we doing and they have like like all of this\n\n56:46.960 --> 56:51.040\ncommunication with each other and it's just you can't just have a buzz cut and sit at your barbecue\n\n56:51.040 --> 56:57.520\nin the front yard and go let's get them Ruskies like it does it that works so well and we don't\n\n56:57.520 --> 57:03.760\nknow how to get that back and we're trying really hard to get that business model operating by you\n\n57:03.760 --> 57:08.240\nknow it's like okay it's like the Nielsen system going like now you're watching this like this\n\n57:08.240 --> 57:14.080\nthis Obama versus Putin shit like I'm not political I don't care about politics I'm not I'm not like\n\n57:14.080 --> 57:18.160\nlike you know Greg Brooks or someone that reads the papers all the time like it's like it seems\n\n57:18.160 --> 57:24.080\nlike we're just trying to really disingenuously trying to create a cold war again where you know\n\n57:24.080 --> 57:28.880\nlike that we hate the Russians again like like nobody fucking cares about us anymore and nobody\n\n57:28.880 --> 57:36.400\ncares about Russia like it's so it's so I feel so bad for everybody and like like I feel like a CNN\n\n57:36.400 --> 57:40.720\nI feel like if Wolf if Wolf Blitzer because they get so fucking excited about war whenever there's\n\n57:40.720 --> 57:45.120\na prospect of any kind of conflict I feel like Wolf Blitzer personally owned a boat and some\n\n57:45.120 --> 57:49.200\nmissiles Syria would Damascus will be done already like he would have fucking gone over\n\n57:49.200 --> 57:53.600\nhimself and done it he'd be plugging one ear with his beautiful hair whipping in the wind\n\n57:53.600 --> 57:59.920\nI'm off the coast of Damascus right now and boy it's lit up like 4th of July also we're Wolf Blitzer\n\n57:59.920 --> 58:09.440\nI fucking he is he's not smart he's not he he seems kind of half retarded the guy I I'm talking loud\n\n58:09.440 --> 58:16.480\nand I don't know about juji juju but bb like who fucking vetted this cock he's like well who vetted\n\n58:16.480 --> 58:24.160\nhim fucking like why first of all Wolf Blitzer no stupid name wait isn't there a name there's a\n\n58:24.160 --> 58:30.400\nchick on cncs and be seen in crystal ball her name is crystal ball and she's a fucking journalist\n\n58:30.400 --> 58:36.560\nwhich is awesome because let's let's let's just call it a spade a spade like really like we gave\n\n58:36.560 --> 58:41.600\nup a long time ago but Wolf Blitzer needs to fucking stop talking because he's a fucking douchey\n\n58:41.600 --> 58:47.520\ndouchey mccockadoodle douchebag well I don't even yeah it's gotten so bare bones that it's I don't\n\n58:47.520 --> 58:51.120\neven think it's treasonous anymore to say that the curtain has dropped on the concept of state\n\n58:51.120 --> 58:55.760\nrun television you're just looking at people it's almost like if there was a war that networks would\n\n58:55.760 --> 58:59.120\nmake more money because we were watching more television watching it and it seems like a lot\n\n58:59.120 --> 59:02.720\nof the networks are owned by companies that make weapons they're like we're kicking that cynical\n\n59:02.720 --> 59:06.320\nabout it but you don't have to be that cynical we're how you doing by the way seek\n\n59:06.320 --> 59:15.120\nwhat's your Syria plan um well we're going to the moon so we don't have to worry about Syria\n\n59:16.960 --> 59:20.800\nwe're not gonna go to the moon before we know where the serious shit goes no probably somebody\n\n59:20.800 --> 59:25.360\nsomebody was somebody yelled at me on reddit for having this kind of like like we're we're abandoning\n\n59:25.360 --> 59:30.320\nthe world or we needed down here and all that stuff I mean it I don't know because the way I\n\n59:30.320 --> 59:36.240\nlook at it is what I think what the world lacks the most of is pioneers and and that's why I put\n\n59:36.240 --> 59:40.400\nthat dedication at the beginning of soul star right when you open up it's as dedicated to all\n\n59:40.400 --> 59:45.760\npioneers and that's actually from an anime that I really love called macros plus which is about\n\n59:46.640 --> 59:51.440\nman that has past earth they're they're they're out there we're out in the universe we're doing\n\n59:51.440 --> 59:56.240\nother things we're we're creating machines and life on other planets and uh and I just see like\n\n59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.160\nright now we have pioneers in technology like they're making the newest phone and they're making\n\n01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:05.280\nthe newest thing we can consume but they're not taking us places they're not expanding us they're\n\n01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:10.240\nnot evolving us really and that was one of my that's on my list did you hear me earlier I said\n\n01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.400\nwhat what has the species done I don't want I'm not asking this in a cynical way I wanted to ask\n\n01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:18.640\nit in a like like because I'm very proud of our species I think obviously we have to be what are\n\n01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:25.360\nwe gonna root for giraffes or I will say I will say as someone who's been close to the the because\n\n01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:33.280\nthat I loved here in uh was it Beth last week um your your neighbor was it the week before but\n\n01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:36.800\nI loved hearing her talk because I think that's what I was tweeting you too she was\n\n01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:42.320\nso close to saying what I've been saying for years but every time I say it freaks people out\n\n01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:47.120\nabout what it's like when you're when you feel like you're gone from this plane you would\n\n01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:53.360\nI'm very proud of humanity too because of I've seen what it's like to not be a part of it anymore\n\n01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:59.840\nso you know when people when you have a bad day just trust me it's it's not as bad as you think\n\n01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:06.000\nit is I promise you because there is unbelievable things we can all do it's I'm really proud of\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.120\nthe human race I just I get this I get disillusioned sometimes when I see the crappy things we do\n\n01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:16.320\nbut I'm 10 times I'm lifted 10 times higher when I see something amazing and positive we do the\n\n01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:21.520\npotential energy is so it's gotten to the point where it's almost ludicrous that we haven't kind\n\n01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.920\nof burst but unfortunately our species history would seem to indicate that it's going to get\n\n01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:33.360\nyou know it has to get worse before this like incredible like ray of light like shoots out\n\n01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:40.240\nby necessity they were a species that is constantly you know we were the first 90% of our history\n\n01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.680\nwe're in gods crosshairs you know just surviving ice ages and and bears were not something that\n\n01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.240\nyou tucked your kids into bed with at night and dogs were not something that fetched your slippers\n\n01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.560\nthese were these were these were equally intelligent animals as far as we were concerned\n\n01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.680\nthey're like they had everything we had we didn't have an alphabet yet and they were like we were\n\n01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:03.040\ncompeting for lunch with them and half the time being lunch and and the triumphs that we have\n\n01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:07.360\nachieved in the face of that like we should be patting ourselves in the back now we're in this\n\n01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:13.360\nmost recent chapter where our species is going through this acne-ridden pubescent phase where\n\n01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:20.160\nthere's a violence this hormonal oily explosions all over us we've covered the earth we're choking it\n\n01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:27.200\num we're affecting it and we we're like we are we have gotten to the point we were absolutely\n\n01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.320\ncapable of turning everything around and the only thing standing in the way at this point\n\n01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:38.480\nis just this reluctance to do it we're just we because we because how is it going to start\n\n01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.960\nwhat what would anyone do how would you what who's going to be the Rosa Parks of an entire planet\n\n01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:48.480\nwho's going to who's going to stand under a under a bodhi tree this time and just go I'm not moving\n\n01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:55.440\nuntil shit gets real uh like like I invite all of the it's a what and obviously that's a horrible\n\n01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.440\nexample that's not what it's going to take like that those are called hacky-sackers they're not\n\n01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:05.600\nchanging anything I like what what what what what can we do I mean the answer is we have to take on\n\n01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:12.640\nthis like crazy non-marketable like Spock mentality where we start going like okay we're going to do\n\n01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:19.040\nthis thing and it's like uh fuck it I don't know whatever like like like we're we're we're we're\n\n01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:23.360\nvery we're very we're very close but it's yeah well the thing is you have to it's like it's\n\n01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:27.360\nprobably I imagine for you like when you're writing there's a there's a technique you have to do where\n\n01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.440\nyou at when you get to a certain point in whatever store you're telling where you have to literally\n\n01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:37.280\nbreak your brain to think in the shoes of that character or that person or whatever I think\n\n01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.920\nthere's a a point where we just have to teach each other that technique how to break your\n\n01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:47.680\nbrain and think differently even if it's just momentarily because I think you you you expand\n\n01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:52.240\nthat way you know like you you grow that way I mean that's all of us go through that when we go\n\n01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:57.600\nthrough puberty like you said like at this stage we're in like 13 to 17 and and even past that I\n\n01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:03.680\nmean I'm technically three years old you know I learned words three years ago I learned writing\n\n01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:09.360\nthree years ago and and walking three you know three years ago so it's like it's um you know\n\n01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.200\nI'm constantly learning new things like there's sometimes people see something I tweet and they're\n\n01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:17.440\nlike oh that was kind of passive aggressive I'm like I just learned what that was I thought it was\n\n01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:27.120\naggressive yeah I'm like and easy yeah so it's uh you know I I'm constantly reconfiguring my brain\n\n01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:33.120\nbecause I have to and I feel like uh that's what we should pass on it to other people is to get\n\n01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.560\nthem to do that because it's not a permanent thing you don't have to crack it like an egg and it's\n\n01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:41.040\ndone you know you could put it back together um you know it's almost like a transformer\n\n01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:45.920\nin a in a yeah we all have to reference way we have to become triple changers exactly\n\n01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:55.280\nbefore this planet uh uh becomes the first transformer movie and kills off Optimus Prime\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.040\nand tries to replace it with Rodimus Prime what oh boy uh all right uh thank you Seek for coming\n\n01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:11.680\nby I was uh happy to hear from you thank you sir all right\n\n01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.240\nI don't know Jeff what's up what's on the what's on the list there there's some goodies on that\n\n01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.600\nwell we gotta I mean well one thing is like tonight I want a hundred percent commit to D&D\n\n01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:30.320\nnow tell me what you think that means like what to you 100 character immersion I've been listening\n\n01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:36.000\nto and they're hey it's not a feral audio podcast but you gotta tip your hat to the to the enemy\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:43.040\nsometimes uh but for those of you who are constantly redditing and tweeting and things about your uh\n\n01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:48.640\nyour dissatisfaction as D&D purists about the level of D&D craftsmanship going out of the stage\n\n01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.880\nthere are people out there that don't think we're playing this game properly there are a couple\n\n01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:59.120\npeople who not giving our all there are a couple people who are so enamored with our desire to\n\n01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:04.480\nbring D&D into the into the mainstream here that they are then they then feel betrayed a little bit\n\n01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:11.360\nI think by our sloppy drunken uh bad D&D playing and a lot of love they want to see us do better\n\n01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:15.920\nthey they believe we can do better oh go look yeah that's for those of us for those of you who'd\n\n01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:20.320\nfeel that way to the point where you wish you weren't listening uh to to to ours I will say I've\n\n01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:26.000\njust started listening to Brian Posein's uh nerd poker podcast uh which is not in front of a live\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.280\naudience it's literally just uh it's just Brian Posein and Blaine Capac and other friends uh\n\n01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:37.440\nplaying D&D for like an hour and a half in the comfort of their own home and they've been playing\n\n01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:42.400\nfor they were friends that started playing 20 years ago and they they're playing very very immersed\n\n01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:49.040\nD&D and doing doing doing great at it having a good it's it's it's night and day from what we do here\n\n01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:53.920\nthe here's what I would say I want to get well that's Spencer actually Spencer come up let's\n\n01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:57.520\nlet's bring Spencer up and talk about it yeah\n\n01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:10.160\nhello Spencer what what what's up you guys now Spencer okay let's let's now if Dan wants to talk\n\n01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.080\nabout getting serious about this because as you know Spencer and I think everyone that plays with me\n\n01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:20.080\nnow I've become overly immersed in D&D I've become very like like intensely involved and I love it\n\n01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:27.200\nyeah but we play Pathfinder on Saturdays now with our private friendly group what we're playing\n\n01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:34.880\nright now is what 3.5 D&D on stage yeah yeah now I don't have that core rulebook or the D&D book on\n\n01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:39.200\nthat one and so I've never taken my character sheet home so when I see my character sheet at the end\n\n01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:43.360\nof every Harmontown I'm looking at stuff for the first time every week I don't know what I don't\n\n01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:49.600\nknow what half of my spells are or you know magical weapons do so like and I can't look them up so\n\n01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:54.560\nmaybe it's time for me to like email me a sheet I could look at it and I would come here more\n\n01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:03.360\nprepared and ready to rumble yeah well that's fine we could do that right oh yeah so so again\n\n01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:07.680\nremember the reason Jeff doesn't want to do Spencer for Halloween is because when when it got mentioned\n\n01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:15.120\nSpencer reacted unenthusiastically right which is a great barometer to use for all decisions\n\n01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:23.360\nhey Spencer should I fry an egg for breakfast tomorrow go for it or should I just kill myself\n\n01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:31.280\nsure man so it's hard best to use your own compass he's a great guy but let's not chart our course\n\n01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:38.000\nby I think Jeff did a great job of explaining kind of what my apprehensions are I don't like I think\n\n01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.440\nit'd be fine if everyone did it but I think the negative like the con side of my head was thinking\n\n01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:48.880\nkind of the same stuff I understand the potential social ramifications and discomfort of somebody\n\n01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:54.160\ngoing like let's all dress like Tyler for Halloween and there's like a very fine line between that\n\n01:08:54.160 --> 01:09:00.640\nand everyone going let's all do our impression of Toby you know like I we all are gonna get anxious\n\n01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:05.920\nabout that and and I would never like like I obviously volunteer myself to be the center of\n\n01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:10.800\nattention and come what may I take the good with the bad other people you know it's like Spencer\n\n01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:17.440\nlikes coming up here but he didn't sign up for being crucified publicly but so I get all that but\n\n01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:22.480\nI think I don't think a sea of people with beards from the Hollywood toy store is going to like\n\n01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:27.760\ndrive anyone to suicide or no me neither I think it won't but also if you're gonna dress up like\n\n01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:33.440\nsomebody for me because I'm a like a style junkie I would want to do it right and I think it'd be\n\n01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:38.240\nhard to pull off a proper Spencer because beards and wigs are usually shitty unless you spend\n\n01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:43.120\nzillions of dollars on them it would be very hard to pull off a proper Spencer beer so I think\n\n01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:48.240\nwhat I'd be doing was a pale caricature which is doesn't do anybody any justice and it's like\n\n01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:53.840\nwhy bother it's just this is just any frigate person now you're talking to a guy who went and\n\n01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:59.200\nbought a wig a Tina Turner wig online and took it to my hairstylist sat down put it on and he cut\n\n01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:06.080\nit and styled it to make my jerry's wig I mean I mean we uh we uh I cut and colored that motherfucker\n\n01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:13.680\nand it looks but that's but anyways this is a this was not Spencer's idea about the dnd full\n\n01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.920\nimmersion nor was it my suggestion that we all do it or anything like that I was just making a\n\n01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:23.200\nkind of new year's resolution if you will that I'm gonna try at least for tonight like I want to\n\n01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:28.800\nreally try to let's do it be immersed in my character I'm all for it I say I say we all really\n\n01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:33.040\njust dive in I feel like it's something like wearing this pad around my neck which is you know\n\n01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.720\nit's an all or nothing deal like like you know I'm leaving the house with it I'm like do I really\n\n01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:42.320\nneed to wear this to to the bathroom uh to the or to the gas station like like do you well the\n\n01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:48.160\nanswer is yeah you have to it's all or nothing you wear to the bathroom well I have to otherwise if\n\n01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:52.400\nyou don't wear it all the time then it's not there's not gonna you know if you can't there's no\n\n01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.760\nway to go like I'm gonna wear this pad because I think I'm entering a situation where I'm gonna\n\n01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:59.200\nthink of something I might want to write down so obviously you I mean I'm assuming you take it off\n\n01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.080\nto go to bed you take it off to go in the shower you're not wearing it for those things but you\n\n01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.360\ndo have to don't shower you what I don't shower so do you bath do you bathe still you take you\n\n01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:14.480\ntake your baths or no yeah a little more hesitant than last time I haven't been bathing like crazy\n\n01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:19.840\nyeah you're in work mode now you're in Vietnam yeah you're gonna get like bad tattoos and stuff\n\n01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:24.640\nlike that yeah so you but you do remember in the morning it's by the bed by your keys and your phone\n\n01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:29.520\nyou put it on and you say okay this is it and Spencer make me a tinier one it was the i-harmon\n\n01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:39.280\nnano it was like the size of like a fortune cookie kind of but I lost that one but again these are\n\n01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:44.320\ncheap that's that's not you know I think you're a better person there's a there's a guy raising\n\n01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:49.920\nhis hand that we've never seen before I don't think I saw you last night you weren't wearing it\n\n01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:59.200\noh where were you I was at the UCB all right no I just look I this guy this guy a fellow in the\n\n01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.520\naudience is saying I saw you last night you weren't wearing it at UCB and I promised Aaron in the\n\n01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:11.120\ngreen room I wouldn't throw her to this pack of hungry people like this is gonna be I took it off\n\n01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:16.240\nbefore I went to UCB because I she saw me wearing it getting ready to go to the UCB\n\n01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:25.280\nand by her she she I'm trying as hard as I can to be fair to her she was being protective of me\n\n01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.880\nand she was just flashing back to being the nerd that she was and like trying to protect me\n\n01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.520\nknowing that I am a person that will leave the house with like my pants tucked into my socks\n\n01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:41.600\nwithout knowing it like and with like a cat on my head like she often needs to save me from the\n\n01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:46.800\npublic and and she but she looked at the finger on my neck and she said you're gonna so you're\n\n01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.680\ngonna wear that so the hole you're gonna wear that out so the UCB and everything huh and I was\n\n01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.960\nlike yeah and then like she's like you know what yeah no you're right you're right you're right\n\n01:12:56.960 -->

Darkstars black key after patching up their\n\n01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:32.560\nwounds and ascending stairs they entered a large room with giant buttons on the walls\n\n01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:41.280\nand a giant porcupine on the floor they began fighting they still are all right that's all\n\n01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:48.560\nthat happened yeah all right so the porcupine is still alive yeah we cut it up pretty good last\n\n01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:55.200\ntime yeah you were pretty far but email not quite yeah by the way someone someone on the subreddit\n\n01:32:55.200 --> 01:33:01.840\nsuggested you know announcing what are our hit points are at the uh at the beginning of each\n\n01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:06.720\nsession because I know I lose track yeah because I don't have a pencil up here when I play when I\n\n01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:11.040\nplay privately I'm able to keep track of my own hit points but yeah I don't know where I am I don't\n\n01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:16.640\nknow how close yeah I am you have a pen on your necklace shut up but I'm not gonna write on my\n\n01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:21.120\ncharacter sheet with a pen you write on your pad with a pen I know what do you like life coach\n\n01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:26.240\nAdam Goldberg is just popping like popcorn tonight what does your hit points say right\n\n01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:30.960\nfor a month make Adam Goldberg their life coach like Tyler was raising his hands he's excited\n\n01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:34.800\nabout Grand Theft Auto and then Adam was like heckling Tyler that's when I got frustrated I was\n\n01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:39.120\nlike shut up you're both you like don't make me come back there you know like it was just like\n\n01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:46.000\nthis is out of hand what do you know what you're my favorite I'm saying but you're all my children\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000\nand you're like the collection of it was pissing me off like you're raising your hand like I want\n\n01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.520\nto talk about Grand Theft Auto and then he's like let it go don't do any more and you're like\n\n01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:57.760\nhe's throwing peas at me and like I'm like I'm taking you both on a grand canyon I'm like\n\n01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:02.400\nI'm gonna throw you in Dan total immersion in your character\n\n01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:08.880\nno tangents maybe as our characters we should say how we're feeling\n\n01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:18.800\njust to immerse all right I'm Christopher Andrew yeah I as a gnome barbarian and still in a fight\n\n01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:22.960\nwith a giant porcupine monster I'm feeling like we should still continue to kick this porcupine\n\n01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:30.240\nmonster's ass and move forward yeah porcupine monster all right what's going on I'll put\n\n01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:38.480\nit at Jeff's turn I take out my my flaming sword and attack the uh straight at his uh at his neck\n\n01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:42.800\nattacking straight at his neck with your flaming sword your strike connects with his necks\n\n01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:50.080\nthe burning sword cuts into his flesh and goes about a foot and a half deep it severs pretty\n\n01:34:50.080 --> 01:35:03.600\nheftily I'd say dealing 17 damage yeah um you see blood kind of pour out of his throat and he falls\n\n01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:10.560\ndown on the floor you see Andrew it's that easy it's that easy so are we are we just going after\n\n01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:15.520\nthe porcupines well he's dead now we got him yeah okay so now it's just but now there are I think\n\n01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:20.640\nthere are there's still some big weird stone buttons on the walls yeah so before you you see a door\n\n01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.920\nit's a big orange door on either side of this door you see three large round buttons there\n\n01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:31.760\nprobably each about four feet wide circular buttons on this wall there's also a hole in the\n\n01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:39.040\nceiling from which comes a long copper pendulum it's just hanging down there it's it's in front\n\n01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:43.360\nof the buttons or where is it in relationship to them it's in front of the door so it's kind of like\n\n01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:48.480\nin the direct middle of this room can it reach the buttons if you were to hit it if you were to\n\n01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:52.560\nhit the pendulum you could hit the pendulum or you could hit the buttons but what if you hit the\n\n01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:58.400\npendulum would it's could it swing and hit a button um I mean it would probably go too high\n\n01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:08.160\nI guess Andrew he's he's immersed he's good I just I'm glad I was here the day that Aaron\n\n01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:18.080\nfell in love with a new person I mean I just wanted to be happy I go up and examine the buttons\n\n01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:24.320\nto see if there's any markings or runes or anything upon them they're not they're just rather slick\n\n01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:31.040\nshiny buttons hmm well there's four of us and there's four buttons there's six buttons there's\n\n01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:38.640\noops there's six of us yeah there's four of us and six buttons all right there's a door there's\n\n01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.880\nfour buttons there's six buttons there's six buttons anybody in the crowd have any three on\n\n01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:50.240\neither side of the door uh yeah uh you have eight hands Sandy what were you gonna say I was gonna\n\n01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:56.640\nmimic Adam Goldberg but I mean you've got to push the buttons well we have yeah okay okay I tear\n\n01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:10.720\napart my sack and I I tie it using my tie use my rope to tie it to my water skins and create a\n\n01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:20.160\nshield in front of the buttons so we can stand behind this water skin bedroll shield I'm just\n\n01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:25.920\ngonna touch the push the left the leftmost button and see what happens but I'm but I'm standing behind\n\n01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:36.400\nthat shield just in case your shield what is it it's like a fort like a living room fort\n\n01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:41.520\ntwo water skins does not make a fort a fort's not a shield it doesn't make a shield either\n\n01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:48.640\nI love you Spencer you have rope I think why would you rip up a sack to tie stuff with\n\n01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:55.840\nit well the rope is stringing it out like like beef jerky you form a shield\n\n01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:04.880\nokay you sold me you sold me don't bring you into this beef jerky bill uh right okay sorry\n\n01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:09.760\nno okay so you're holding this out these two water skins yeah you're just I'm immersed in\n\n01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:15.920\nmy character you're the character of a homeless person that thinks that the government's trying\n\n01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:22.960\nto read their mind I tell everybody about my protect me I go up and examine the pendulum\n\n01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:26.640\nis there anything on the pendulum how's it attached to the ceiling it goes up into this\n\n01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:31.200\nhole in the ceiling it's a rather big hole maybe about can you six feet around can you see\n\n01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:38.800\nwhat's if you look up can you see what's outside of the hole blackness but we know it's a hole\n\n01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:43.600\nquarter crystal burger goes up like a black hole okay maybe crawl up that that that that rope\n\n01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.960\nthe since the hole's big enough that you could find out what's up there I want to I want to\n\n01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:51.040\ntry to press the leftmost button I'm gonna stand back while you do that because I'm afraid I stand\n\n01:38:51.040 --> 01:39:00.320\nbehind my shield I look at your shield and go wow you press the leftmost button and you hear a\n\n01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:08.800\nrumbling sound from overhead oops I say sorry shouldn't have had that whatever we had this is\n\n01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:15.520\nyour full character immersive yeah I'm looking forward to that starting by the way all right\n\n01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:27.760\nshit what's that rumbling there we go yeah so you look up to see lava pouring out of this hole\n\n01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:44.720\nin the ceiling it's getting hot in here yeah are you doing lava sound yeah I think I'd be better\n\n01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:50.240\njust doing sound effects all right can I follow your heart you're a songwriter you wrote the lady\n\n01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:54.960\nin red the wonder of the 80s so lava's coming down around the pendulum yeah pours down this hole\n\n01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:59.840\nnot around the pendulum but from that same hole and it pours down and starts to pool it's pulling\n\n01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:06.560\nup around the floor whoops move away from it okay can I I see that I have a new tree token\n\n01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:11.600\nwhere are we getting these skills that we're looking at that where we're getting these uh\n\n01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:20.480\noh I didn't look at this other paper I pressed I pressed the second leftmost button okay so\n\n01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:25.680\nnone of you want to like move out of the lava floor because I said you'd have to and then no\n\n01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:33.360\nrespond I've I've repositioned as far away from the lava as I can't perfect I also I I pack up my\n\n01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:40.640\nshield I also do but wait I have a climbing kit that's true can we climb the pendulum um you can\n\n01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:47.040\ntry yeah yeah let's climb that and see what's up there all right so you you try to scramble up this\n\n01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:52.080\npendulum and as you pull it you feel it it kind of gives like it goes chunk and falls down a little\n\n01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:57.600\nbit and um as it falls down a little bit you hear another rumbling sound coming from this hole and\n\n01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:06.720\nit also sounds like the grinding of metal plates um yeah it sounds ominous is there lava near the\n\n01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:10.560\nbuttons can we get to the button safely without being in lava at this point you guys are on one\n\n01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:17.280\nside like you're between the lava and the buttons so like if the how fast is the lava moving towards\n\n01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:21.600\nus it's not moving towards you anymore because you moved out of the way in fact it's starting to\n\n01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:27.840\ndrain down this drain in the floor so I guess you guys moved out of the way I hop over the lava\n\n01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:32.720\nwell you already okay so but I'm already close to the yeah if you want to go to the other side\n\n01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:39.600\nbut you're already okay all right I hit another button okay well I put let's keep track of it\n\n01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:45.040\ndid I hit the second button not yet I was still doing is climbing so the grinding sound continues\n\n01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:51.840\nand then um you hear a chunk chunk chunk like um falling boulders coming from above above this hole\n\n01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:59.520\nand you're still dangling on this essentially a rope under this hole look out yeah I have another\n\n01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:06.320\nquestion I don't know if this could help us sure I it says I'm an escape artist can we escape from\n\n01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:14.240\nhere I don't know I don't know if that's you know do you have do you have disabled device\n\n01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:20.400\nunder skills yeah yeah could he could he try to disable the vice or use perception on the door\n\n01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:26.160\nand figure out how to how to open it yeah I mean definitely let's uh disable the device then okay\n\n01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:32.240\nso you get off this pendulum thing to go over to the door which is the device you're disabling\n\n01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:38.160\nI'm assuming um so so you go over to this door and you're checking it out and this grinding\n\n01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:45.440\ncontinues and then a giant giant block of ice crashes down where this pendulum was from the hole\n\n01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:55.040\nin the ceiling oh weird I'm immersed I'm immersed you don't you you don't find a way to uh unlock\n\n01:42:55.040 --> 01:43:00.720\nthis door however so did he was that was that a trap that was meant to kill somebody I've been\n\n01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:06.000\nbeneath it or what all I'm saying is that he pulled on this thing and then a giant cube of ice fell\n\n01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:19.360\ndown push the button pull the chain you will experience an icy rain I pressed the third button\n\n01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:25.840\nif a chocolate choo choo train comes out we'll know that Spencer writes us uh during the show\n\n01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:31.840\nI mean yeah well as you press the button you hear uh it sounds like a squelching sound and\n\n01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:35.440\nthick black tar oozes from this hole in the ceiling\n\n01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:38.640\nchocolate choo choo train\n\n01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:46.080\nI mean it's all it sounds like a chocolate choo choo train we've got to figure out how to fill\n\n01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:54.880\nthis room with milk and lemonade we're gonna die is there something we could tie an 150 foot rope\n\n01:43:54.880 --> 01:44:00.320\nto and climb out or you can try and climb up out of that hole in the ceiling but you wouldn't need\n\n01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:06.960\nthe rope oh let's not use the rope okay so one button made lava one button made ice one button\n\n01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:12.560\nmade black tar there's one button left one of these is gonna be there's three left there's three\n\n01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:19.680\nmore there's gonna be milk lemonade it's milk oh milk lemonade and out of the hole fudges made\n\n01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:27.440\nokay I go push one of the other fourth fourth button fourth button fourth button\n\n01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:35.440\num yeah you just hear a bubbling sound and purple mist pours into the room out of the ceiling\n\n01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:43.200\nhole positive purple mist he seemed a little bummed out yeah yeah I mean it's not as negative\n\n01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:52.160\nas it could have been cool party atmosphere or is it is it scary is it making us feel good purple\n\n01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:59.360\nmist or no it's like it's like definitely caustic and burning your throat and tearing out your eyes\n\n01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:04.560\nand uh okay so it's bad purple mist yeah not the kind of purple mist one thing's for sure I'm\n\n01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:10.000\npushing all these buttons before we die I'm not going to go to my my death going like what about\n\n01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.480\nthe six button we gotta figure it out what do you think the point of the pendulum is this pendulum\n\n01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:21.600\nis here I'm immersed in my character that has oh shit I have 19 intelligence yeah use it I guess\n\n01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:28.640\nI would have been smarter than I know I just saw that I have nine but you know my 19 I just\n\n01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:33.040\ntry just just for just because I'm curious I swing I swing the pendulum to see what happens if I move\n\n01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:37.040\nthe pendulum from side to side you push the pendulum and it kind of goes a little bit before\n\n01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:41.840\ncoming back to equilibrium and stopping but then the grinding noise starts and you see another\n\n01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:47.920\nchunk of ice fall through the ceiling it's a big block cube of ice and it's chunk and we've\n\n01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:52.080\nclimbed that ice out of here yeah like the ice and the lava got something to do with each other\n\n01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:55.920\nwell how does that is the ice hitting the lava landing in lava well at this point all the lava\n\n01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:01.600\nis drained out there's sticky tar covering the floor but uh and the first button made lava come down\n\n01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:06.800\nyeah I'm gonna I'm gonna push another button which one the fifth button the fifth button\n\n01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:15.520\nyou push the fifth button and a steady stream of fizzling brown fluid comes from the whole\n\n01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:25.280\nnot even right around the corner fudges yeah well I mean but like root beer yeah\n\n01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:31.520\nyeah fizzling brown liquid comes out yeah and what's it what's it what's its properties what's it\n\n01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:39.600\nI don't know is it hot is it cold do you want to interact with it as a character\n\n01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:44.160\nwe want to smell it you smell it and you smell 23 cents\n\n01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:52.880\nstreet value no no like different different sense oh sharpie should be a small year\n\n01:46:52.880 --> 01:47:01.440\nuh I I take I take my pinky finger and I I put it in the brown fizzling liquid\n\n01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:08.880\nit's a bit tingling on your finger like good tingling yeah yeah like friendly oh I jump on it\n\n01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:19.520\nI roll around with it I laugh I laugh it's delight I put my finger in and I taste it\n\n01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:28.400\nit tastes like the 23 flavors of dr pepper that's right dr pepper now comes in diet\n\n01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:37.280\nwait a minute the fifth button dispenses dr pepper okay I said I'd immerse myself in character but\n\n01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:43.120\nnot when I smell a paola scandal happening and Spencer who have you been talking to and what\n\n01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:51.680\nshouldn't you try to pull when you need to get out of life's dungeon crack open a dr pepper\n\n01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:55.440\nall right we have not been paying the dungeon master\n\n01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:02.000\njust making deals out of the table have you been approached by corporate sponsorship\n\n01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:11.200\nno no it just became a funny detour oh god I I I take off my shirt and and while I take it off\n\n01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:15.360\nI imagine that I'm a sexy construction worker and there's girls going by like in the diet\n\n01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:22.080\ndr pepper commercial that I happen I and I have a nice refreshing goblets of of dr pepper I press\n\n01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:31.920\nthe six button more more sticky black tar pours out is it so the ceiling okay all right is it\n\n01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:38.560\ncoke no it's like a it's like a sticky black tar all right I jump on the pendulum grab the\n\n01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:42.800\ngrab the rope and then jump off and see if an ice block falls down a third ice block falls down\n\n01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:47.840\non top of the other one yeah are they stacking up can we no because okay so like the one hit it\n\n01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:52.880\nI should explain this at the time what am I thinking the first one hit it off center and\n\n01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:56.880\nthe toppled and it kind of slid apart and then the third one went between them so now there's\n\n01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:03.360\nkind of like three ice blocks on roughly even floor I try to climb out of the hole the hole in\n\n01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:08.720\nthe ceiling it's about 30 feet higher than standing on top of one of those ice how tall are the ice\n\n01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:17.840\nblocks the ice blocks are about seven feet tall audience anybody have any ideas oh yeah\n\n01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:25.520\na young lady shouted out fill the room with dr pepper and float on the ice cubes up to the same\n\n01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:36.480\nand also float on the on the taste sensation of 23 natural natural flavors I go to the fifth button\n\n01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:44.000\nand I and I push my back against it to push up more dr pepper comes I keep on I jump on the pendulum\n\n01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:49.920\nand keep yanking for more ice ice and dr pepper fill the room with a delicious reflection a\n\n01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:57.520\nrefreshing refreshing refreshing it it refreshes you guys all right fills up the room it's it's\n\n01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:04.640\ngoing towards the top all right the ice cubes are floating I these things that we that have happened\n\n01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:12.160\nto us yeah it's been quite a day uh are we are we floating up now like I mean that depends on\n\n01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:16.480\nwhat you're doing when this room is being filled up with dr pepper I'm treading I'm not a witch I\n\n01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:25.280\nfloat oh no I am a witch I float which is flow regular people sink I have 11 swim skill like\n\n01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:31.120\npoint sort uh ranks and the fizzy effervescence also aids buoyance that's what I'm gonna ask\n\n01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:34.880\nabsolutely I was gonna ask and also could you know you know and Charlie in the chocolate factory\n\n01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:39.840\nwhen he when he when he in the the the fizzy listing drink yeah can we do something like that\n\n01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:46.080\nsomehow like if we drink a lot of the dr pepper can we that's not gonna help yeah without the\n\n01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:51.280\nregret at the end there's no fan at the time I'm just getting under the hole and treading water and\n\n01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:58.400\nI keep yanking on the the chain and making ice come ice fill up yeah so I mean it goes up to\n\n01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:03.760\nthe top and you got a bunch of ice and I got this slippery floating floor and you think that you\n\n01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:08.080\nmight be able to scramble up into this hole that you guys were working towards I try to scramble\n\n01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:15.360\nme too you take my hand you scramble up out of the hole\n\n01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:21.840\n23 flavors of helpful\n\n01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:27.360\nokay I can't look at you right now\n\n01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:37.360\nbut yeah so you get out of this area and you find yourself in a in a great black hall the walls are\n\n01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:43.040\nall iron and there's a four doors one of them leads up a staircase that goes up what looks like\n\n01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:48.000\nmaybe a tower a spire sort of thing I look back at the group and I say you guys I don't know what\n\n01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:58.080\ndr pepper is but it really was a pick me up or literally picked us up to the hole can you not\n\n01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:04.640\nlook at him either or I I'm looking at everybody and I'm searching in their eyes for an ending to\n\n01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:07.920\nokay so\n\n01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:16.800\nAndrew's just scouring over these three pages of pencil scrawls Andrew Kumail Nanjiani\n\n01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:20.960\ncomes back to regain his character probably next week you want to leave some sort of mark on his\n\n01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:28.480\nexistence on his character so like you can you just make up shit yeah it's all whatever you want
