WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
I'm Gloria's Uptown Burbank. Once again, Harmontown is now in session.

00:16.000 --> 00:39.000
It's so good to be back. We missed you guys. You know who I missed the most? The Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
I never stop missing the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. What a crowd. What a crowd.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Yeah.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
So there's too many variables for us to track. We now don't know, is Saturday night a better night?

00:59.000 --> 01:11.000
Have we been slowly, because my liberal views have slowly seeped out and have they alienated one Nazi that's been replaced by five Democrats?

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
Or are Bernie Crats just more patient, or do they have less to do on Saturdays?

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
I don't know. We took off a bunch of weeks off. Should we just do the show once a month and then have a heightened interest?

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
Steve Levy with Ice, everybody. Steve Levy.

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
Flattered by your numbers and your applause. Thank you. Was that a sneeze or Italian blood?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
He said frost. He said what?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
He said frost. Frosty.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Frosty?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Frosty? I hope not.

01:46.000 --> 02:00.000
Could be Tourette's. We don't know. You can't make fun of people anymore. We got an internet now. No matter how silly someone is, you can find out how they feel.

02:00.000 --> 02:10.000
It just ruins everything. If Octomom happened tomorrow, there would be a Tumblr blog from her the next day where she's just like, here's how it feels to be Octomom.

02:10.000 --> 02:27.000
And we'd be like, fuck me. Yeah, be an Octomom. Everything. We're an admirer of information. We're not learning anything. We're not getting smarter.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
We're getting scared. We're chimpanzees and we just have alarm signals. We talked about that in our pockets.

02:35.000 --> 02:49.000
And also listed things to talk about in our pockets too. I was watching Intervention again. This note could be from anywhere in the last ten years.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
And someone used the phrase short end of the stick and Cody, my girlfriend, brought up an interesting point. I've never really examined that phrase.

02:56.000 --> 03:07.000
She's like, what's with this short end of the stick? Just pull the stick. You get a whole stick. Why is this short end of the stick? How can you have a short end of a stick?

03:07.000 --> 03:17.000
It doesn't even make sense. Maybe it's like drawing straws or maybe you have to grab it and whoever grabs it has less stick. That's the person that's chosen.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
A stick has two ends and neither are shorter than the other. For sure.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
But if two people are grabbing it at the same time, maybe one end is sticking out.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
You're referring to that crazy baseball bat game with the hands.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
That's a total guess. That's probably wrong.

03:32.000 --> 03:42.000
Let's just think about this, you guys. If you were to grab a stick, which end would you grab? The short end or the tall end?

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
There is no...

03:44.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, no, the tall end. You would grab the tall end. If you're a baseball player, you want the short end because you need more bats to be able to hit the ball.

03:53.000 --> 04:02.000
How do you know when you're grabbing? How do you grab the tall end by putting your hand lower or higher?

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
You've got to grab the tall end.

04:06.000 --> 04:19.000
I can understand because we have wishbones in our culture, but that's like a slingshot and you pull and there's a way to get the short end.

04:19.000 --> 04:34.000
Also, short end of the stick, it always means... there's not luck involved usually. Short end of the stick is more like, oh yeah, we decided to do a designated driver program and then my turn came up on prom night.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
I kind of got the short end of the stick there. It wasn't like a luck of the draw as much as it was. I got fucked by the system.

04:41.000 --> 04:50.000
Short end of the stick. I agree with Cody. Don't be such a cynic. Just grab the stick. You've got a whole stick.

04:50.000 --> 05:00.000
Now you won the stick contest. You've got a whole stick, whatever that's where. You're imprisoned in a matrix where you're valuing the ends of sticks and someone's laughing at you.

05:00.000 --> 05:07.000
Big stick is laughing at you. Long stick is laughing at you.

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
Boy, this new note taking app. It just says leaks. That's all it says.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
It looks like it used to be the worst end of the staff.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
And then it got changed to the short end of the stick.

05:21.000 --> 05:29.000
I was just reading about it. There's the wrong end of the stick, the wrong end of the staff. It's a medieval origin thing.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
So to be on the wrong end of the staff, the short end, I don't know.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
Again, I would want to be on the short end because there's less stick to get hit with.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
If somebody's waving you this much stick, I can whack him that much. See what I'm talking about?

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
I want to be on the shorter end of my stick. I want you on the wrong end of my stick.

05:51.000 --> 06:01.000
You're saying that if someone's holding a stick, then if the long end is pointing at you, then you're getting stabbed.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
If the short end is pointing at you, they're committing Harry Carey in front of you.

06:07.000 --> 06:14.000
But the expression means to get the shit end of a bargain or to get something wrong.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
It's inverted in that.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
That's why I would have been the first to die in the medieval times.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
You know what always hangs me up is the business end of things.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
Oh, I'm at the business end of a revolver. I'm not sure. I've got to remember what you mean by that.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
I don't know. Are you holding the revolver or are you about to get shot?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
The business is where the bullet comes out.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
Are you the customer of a revolver if you're getting shot? I don't know. You pay no money.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
You go cruising for cruising.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
You are stimulating the marketplace by being a dead person.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
This is like, oh, I want more of those. You're in the market for getting shot.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
You're entering the market, baby.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
I was watching Intervention and there was a woman today. Here's the thing about Intervention.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
I watch it relentlessly. Of course, there's the joke. I'm addicted to Intervention.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
But here's my confession about Intervention as I think I've confessed before.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
It's truly a guilty pleasure beyond, like, let's watch Gremlins 2, Guilty Pleasure.

07:13.000 --> 07:22.000
This is truly a guilty pleasure because I watch Intervention with Cody and we absolutely pick and choose who deserves recovery.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
Based on what they did to earn their addiction.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
If you got molested, pass. You're done. You're fine.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
I don't care how much of a prick you are to your parents at 35 and how much coke you need to keep doing.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
If there's some story from your past where you went camping and someone was like, let me show you how to fish.

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
They meant something else. You can do as much coke as you want and you can throw chairs at Jeff Van Vondren.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
I don't care. You're cool. I root for you. I hope you recover.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
There was this Indian guy. He was adopted by this beautiful white Christian family.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
They looked like a crazy 80's Christmas card, this family.

08:05.000 --> 08:12.000
Also, as an extension of their Christianity, they adopted this kid from India who was two years old when he came over.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
He probably only had the vaguest unconscious memories of, like, he was found in a pool of diarrhea or something.

08:19.000 --> 08:26.000
They were a dire rescuing human from a part of the earth where the parents weren't in surplus.

08:26.000 --> 08:35.000
Then he grew up as part of this Christian family. They thought, oh, you're so brown, but we love you.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
They were doing it wrong. They were like, you look just like us to us.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
It's just sort of war on them. Then he was like, I don't know. I kind of feel better when I do heroin.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
They were like, yeah, but Jesus would be even better than that heroin.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
He had my permission to be all fucked up.

08:51.000 --> 08:58.000
But then Candy Finnegan comes in through the skylight. She's like, I was adopted. If you're adopted, Candy Finnegan will sort your shit out, man.

08:58.000 --> 09:07.000
Sorry, anyways. I was at intervention. There was a woman. It said she's been addicted to crack for 30 years.

09:07.000 --> 09:18.000
I mean, mission accomplished. Did she invent crack? She must have smoked the first crack, and she's doing fine.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
She knows exactly how much to not do.

09:21.000 --> 09:28.000
Yeah, she's like Mr. Robot with the morphine. Is he Mr. Robot? Don't tell me.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
What? The pool of diarrhea?

09:33.000 --> 09:39.000
I'm not trying to be like, what? I'm saying they adopted this kid.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
That's so much diarrhea.

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
Well, you saw a slim dog millionaire, right? No, no.

09:48.000 --> 09:55.000
There's a pool of diarrhea scene. It just, it sounds like it costs money to make a pool of diarrhea.

09:55.000 --> 10:01.000
That's not something that happens from lack of upkeep that takes work and money.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
What else is in here?

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
What if you were the pool guy? That's the worst job.

10:07.000 --> 10:14.000
You're checking the levels. Yeah, it's diarrhea. You're picturing like a pool swimming pool of diarrhea.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Why are you paying me to get leaves out of a pool of diarrhea?

10:18.000 --> 10:26.000
And why did it have to be Olympic size? This is why the Olympics don't come here.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
I think the Olympics come into LA in 2020.

10:28.000 --> 10:38.000
Oh my God, I'm so mad about that. I hate the Olympics, you guys, and fuck everybody and fuck America.

10:38.000 --> 10:47.000
We should do the show on Saturdays. We got Feisty Spencer, we got a packed house.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
I know. That's one of the few things I could talk about. I don't like the Olympics.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Because the Olympics come to town and they...

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
I don't like the IOC. They're bad people. They come in and they're like...

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
The International Olympic Commission?

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
Yeah, they're like, give us all the money because we're the Olympics. They're like a mafia.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
They just come around and they're like, it would be a shame if the Olympics weren't allowed to happen in your city.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
Maybe you build a couple of stadiums.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
Yeah, because every 10-day Olympics comes to town when they went to London, when they went to Rio.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
The people all go broke. The traffic sucks. You're late for work. Your life is miserable.

11:27.000 --> 11:34.000
And a bunch of people that run contracting for like the soccer stadiums and for all the infrastructure,

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
they all get rich, but it's all kickbacks. It's all their crony friends and stuff like that.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
And the IOC is suing all the while. They're just sending out lawsuits.

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
The gold medal burger? Fuck you. Pay us money. You got the Olympics special because we're in your town

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
and everyone Olympics is in your town. Pay us money because you can't use the rings.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Like, you know, they're bad people.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
They told, and our guest tonight probably maybe knows better about this.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
They told people in London, they're like, yeah, the commute times are going to be longer,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
so just get up early. Go to work early.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
That was their solve for that was like, don't complain about the travel time. Just work longer.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
Wasn't there a bus driver's strike around then too? Who cares?

12:17.000 --> 12:22.000
And it's all under the umbrella, obviously, just as everything in Hollywood is kind of under the umbrella

12:22.000 --> 12:29.000
of like, oh, you're a PA and you don't like being awake for 16 hours and changing my cat's box.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Like, what, you hate Marilyn Monroe or something?

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
You know, it's like, we get away with a lot of abuse in Hollywood because it's Hollywood

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
and everyone wants to be in it. So the Olympics got to be like, oh, your city doesn't want

12:41.000 --> 12:50.000
the single global, I'm trying to riff the, you know, the Olympics are cool.

12:50.000 --> 12:57.000
The Olympics represent international harmony, so you can't say I don't want the Olympics here.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Right, but I wonder how it breaks down. Well, let's talk to a Londoner.

13:01.000 --> 13:09.000
This guy's also an amazing standup that I just met on Thursday and then I kept running into him.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
I'm like, come on, come on the show, man. He's got this documentary series that you can tell from.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
I can tell from the trailer is really good, but haven't actually seen it. It's on Vice Land.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
It's called Hate Thy Neighbor, but you can absolutely tell it's awesome.

13:22.000 --> 13:39.000
Please welcome Jamali Maddox.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
Can you talk like a chimney sweep?

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
No. That's the thing is like, people think we actually talk like that.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
But me saying it right now, I think that I probably do sound like a chimney sweep.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
To us, you do. To us.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I'm like saying it like, we don't all talk like chimney sweeps.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
The label's like, you sound like a chimney sweep, right?

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
You sound more like a chimney sweep than us doing our best impression of a chimney sweep.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
Right, but then Jewish as well is, I know coming here, I didn't realize that people get surprised

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
of this accent coming out of this face.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Right.

14:10.000 --> 14:17.000
Like people expect like a guy riding a horse and I come along and go, hey, you know, brown-skinned dude.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
You think we expect you to be riding a horse without actually?

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
I thought people would send me to be white, but they want to jump in there too quickly.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
I mean, the whitest thing in the world would be just to be coming down the street on a horse.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
That's how white people are living nowadays, man.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
That's the Trump dream.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
We're going to be back right now.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Who get horses?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
A horse on every stable.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
That's what's making America great.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Let's go back to that day in time where everybody rode horses.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
That's what make America great means.

14:47.000 --> 14:53.000
If you could just have enough technology to breed horses that ate coal, we would be very happy.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
That would be our dream.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
So you could have a literally a 10-horse powered horse.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
And then everyone could just like, yeah, and there would just be waiting and shit outside.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
Like the shit would like, there would be like a holiday where all the poor people cleaned up the shit

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
and played frisbee with it.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Playing frisbee with the shit.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
To what extent?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Wait, why did that get a laugh?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Did I ignore a question or did I?

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
You just very nonchalantly glossed over.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
He said, why play frisbee with the shit?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
You said, why?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Okay, that's why.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
I recognize that laugh as Dan ignored a question.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
I said, why frisbee as opposed to what?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Then a plastic frisbee.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
I don't know why.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
This isn't going to hold up to a lot of questions, but...

15:40.000 --> 15:48.000
I was imagining that like, I guess I have an ancestry from Oklahoma.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
And there's like a lot of jokes about like buffalo chips.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
I don't know, like there's like disc shaped like manure.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
And I think there's like people that like throw it in contests.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Maybe that was in my iCloud.

16:03.000 --> 16:12.000
But I was just generally kind of like imagining like, how would corporate America turn cleaning up shit into a sport or a fun activity?

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
It's a great activity next to your pool of diarrhea.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
It's extreme shit.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
How would you sponsor it?

16:21.000 --> 16:34.000
Well, we're on questions because I'm a big fan of linguistics.

16:34.000 --> 16:42.000
To most of us that aren't that cosmopolitan, I think maybe those of us that listen to NPR are like at a level of American that has the sense that,

16:42.000 --> 16:52.000
okay, John Oliver's accent is its lower class in its origins than like say the two other British people that I worked with on Community.

16:52.000 --> 17:00.000
Like Tristram Shapiro was a director and he sounded more like James Bond than John Oliver.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
John Oliver would tell you he's from some part of London or something like.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Really? I kind of thought John Oliver was a posh dude for it.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Really?

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
You know, I think over here people, so you can tell the cross difference in voices.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
No, we can't.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
You know what we have because we were discussing this the other day.

17:19.000 --> 17:27.000
American hegemony dictates that you're forced to know what an Alabama Walmart is and I don't know what a, we're just sure Wayne's cutting is.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
To the point where I made it up.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
That's where somebody poops in your chair.

17:31.000 --> 17:38.000
But we would tend to maybe like there's people with southern accents.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
We have a whole culture thing here that's where you associate certain accents with stuff.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
But why am I explaining this?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I know the least about it.

17:48.000 --> 17:57.000
But the UK is like this compressed area and you go there and even within the boundaries of London it's so confusing to Americans.

17:57.000 --> 18:04.000
I think because we, our history is 200 years long and was defined by everyone going, I don't like this.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
I'm leaving and like everyone just spread out.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
You have to go, you have to grow up a million miles from someone to sound different from them in America.

18:12.000 --> 18:22.000
And in the UK which predates cars and predates like the land of milk and honey where you just fucking split when you don't like a vibe.

18:22.000 --> 18:33.000
Like you walk one block from the Queen's English with the epicenter of it and as, I'm about to steal somebody's stand up.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
It was Rick.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Rick Overton.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Rick Overton.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
Yeah, I had the joke about going to London and being like, I'm a blot, you can see the palace from here.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
How does the bread go this bad this close to the bakery?

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
Because, because people are talking ugly.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
So where are you from?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Are you?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
I'm sorry, go ahead.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
No, no, no, please, please, please.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
No, no, go ahead.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Oh, yeah.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
See, that's British right there.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
It's like the way that I apologize to him and then he apologized back.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
I was like, but no, no, please.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Right.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
But yeah, no, I'm from, I'm from the East of London.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
So I'm from East London.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
So that's like working class area back job.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Right.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Yeah.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
So like, and when, God damn it, fucking Borat, God damn it.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Sasha Baron Cohen.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
Yes, when Sasha is doing Ali G, was he doing East London?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Okay.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Okay.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
No.

19:25.000 --> 19:33.000
That's not like, that is a, that I'm trying to be so polite because I know it's been

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
live stream.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Are you talking about chavs?

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
No.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Sorry.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
That's like this weird thing now where it's like, like they call them chavs.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Chav is just a way to, to insult working class.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Right.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I don't think Ali G did.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I think Ali G was satirizing people doing that.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
But if there was this big influx where there's this new black face of people coming up to

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
me going like, what's going on, brother?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
What's going on?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Bloods.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
And it's this whole thing of like, and it's like, I'd rather just call me the N-word and

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
let me get on with my day.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Do you know what I'm saying?

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
It's this, this constant thing of just justified bullshit.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
You know, and it's like, so that that accent isn't, isn't no one's accent.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
No one actually.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Oh, well, okay.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah.

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
But, but is that to say that he's doing a very cartoonish version of an accent that does

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
exist and that you can pinpoint?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Yeah, okay.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
But it's more of a cultural thing, like kind of a hip hop beat kind of.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Yeah.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
It's the UK version.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Yeah.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
But that, but that particular accent, like no one is like, that's so cartoony that no one

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
actually speaks like that.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Right.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
And it's actually borderline.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Maybe I don't want to use the word offensive, but whatever.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
No, I never found it offensive.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
I didn't find the offensive craft.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
I saw what he was doing.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
I saw a person that he was taking the piss out of people that would do that.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
But at the same time, like people would mimic that.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
That's a good segue to what you're currently doing for a living because it seems to me like

20:49.000 --> 20:55.000
the word offensive probably has a lot more callous around it for you because you're right

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
now drawing a paycheck going around talking to Nazis and stuff.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Yeah.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
Like your show is hate thy neighbor, which I haven't seen yet, but I can't wait to.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
But because you're just going in.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
Are you because I don't I can't tell from the trailer.

21:10.000 --> 21:17.000
Are you are you so like outside of the whole like concentric constant, the cosmology that

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
you're like, yeah, race is bullshit.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
And this guy is a white militant.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
This guy's a black militant.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
I mean, what's the difference?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Or are you like actually just going, these are weirdos.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Let's poke them or somewhere in between.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Like what's your kind of.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
I mean, did you know what?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Like what?

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
Because I do stand up in it as well and just stand up, use words to the through line.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
And a lot of people would like, we have to tell them what the show is.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
And they were like, oh, he's going to take the piss out of me.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I go, listen, I only take the piss out of your ideas.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
I never take the piss out of you personally.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
I never say, and this fat dude or this skinny.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Right.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
You know, it weren't that.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
But you say that to the subject.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Yeah.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Yeah.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Yeah.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Yeah.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Yeah.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Yeah.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Yeah.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Yeah.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Yeah.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Yeah.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Yeah.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
You know what I'm going to do?

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
I'm willing to hear you out.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
But then if there's something that comes up that I don't believe in, I'm going to say it.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
And so when it cuts to you doing stand up in the show, I mean, are you, aren't you talking

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
about going and doing these interviews?

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
And how are you not, how are you not taking the piss out of them?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Well, I'm taking the piss out of their ideas.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
So I think if their ideas are being willing to put up, then they're being willing to take

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
the piss out.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Right.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
You know what I'm saying?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Yeah.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
I feel like that's okay.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
I mean, I don't think like those are people with no teeth.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
I'm not going to say you no teeth.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Really?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
So yeah.

22:27.000 --> 22:33.000
I think that's like, you know, that's like my thing where I didn't want to do that because

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
that's easy.

22:34.000 --> 22:39.320
That's a line that we're becoming conscious of now that's like, it's like newly forming

22:39.320 --> 22:44.400
in the sand for us, especially with comedy, because it's like, if you're a big fat dude

22:44.400 --> 22:52.560
and you're racist, and I mean, it's like really like, it makes perfect sense to us that turn

22:52.560 --> 22:55.240
about as fair play and we should just talk about how fat you are.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.560
And we're kind of like trying to find the lines there.

22:57.560 --> 23:02.480
Like we've just now figured out that you can't just talk about how disgustingly ugly Kellyanne

23:02.480 --> 23:03.480
Conway is.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.480
Yeah.

23:04.480 --> 23:08.760
Like you have to focus on the disgusting ugliness of her ideas.

23:08.760 --> 23:12.480
Because I'm standing here and I say that I have all this morality.

23:12.480 --> 23:17.400
There was one time where I did do that and took the piss out of them personally because

23:17.400 --> 23:21.680
they insulted me so much because they basically like, basically what it is, I went to this

23:21.680 --> 23:28.440
bar in Georgia, you know what I should do, so I went to this bar and surprise, surprise,

23:28.440 --> 23:30.000
I weren't allowed in.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.840
I think it's because I wear glasses, I don't know.

23:31.840 --> 23:37.600
So they let me in and then the guy comes out and he's like saying like, look man, you

23:37.600 --> 23:42.760
can't come in because we spoke to the other Nazis and we had a meeting and they said,

23:42.760 --> 23:46.320
if you come in, then we can't guarantee your safety, right?

23:46.320 --> 23:49.720
And the best bit was, I was with my all white camera crew and they said, the camera crew

23:49.720 --> 23:52.120
can go in, but you can't go in, right?

23:52.120 --> 23:53.640
And I was like, that's fucked up.

23:53.640 --> 23:57.120
So my camera crew went in, but little did they know that all of my camera crew were

23:57.120 --> 23:58.120
Jewish.

23:58.120 --> 24:04.920
They were the little Jews, but they went in and they're filming it and the owner of the

24:04.920 --> 24:10.480
bar comes across the road and he says, and he's like, why are you standing there with

24:10.480 --> 24:11.480
binoculars?

24:11.480 --> 24:18.680
And I said like, oh, they said I can't come inside and then he goes, you can come inside

24:18.680 --> 24:19.680
now.

24:19.680 --> 24:23.720
And I said, no, I won't go inside because at that point, I was like, if I'm not good

24:23.720 --> 24:26.640
enough, then I ain't good enough now.

24:26.640 --> 24:28.920
What changed their tune after time passed?

24:28.920 --> 24:29.920
Because it wasn't the owner.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.400
It had the owner of the Ku Klux Klan bar.

24:31.400 --> 24:34.360
This is the best bit is I was telling him about all the races that I heard and at one

24:34.360 --> 24:36.360
point he went, what, in my Klan bar?

24:36.360 --> 24:37.360
He was surprised.

24:37.360 --> 24:38.360
What, here?

24:38.360 --> 24:39.360
Oh, hell no.

24:39.360 --> 24:40.360
Oh, here, sir.

24:40.360 --> 24:41.360
No.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.680
And he was like, and then at one point he goes, you should come inside.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.000
We've got good chicken wings.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
I swear to God.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
And I was like, I was pretty loaded.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
He didn't say that.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
That's not bullshit.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
And you're like, listen to my voice.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Yeah.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Do you want to lie though?

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
You said, I won't hurry.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.640
I like that he said he didn't say that, but he owns a Klan bar.

24:58.640 --> 25:01.320
So stereotypes isn't really a line he won't cross.

25:01.320 --> 25:05.400
No, it's like, it's putting such a fine point on it.

25:05.400 --> 25:08.360
It's like, it's like, it's really committing to being the typical ass way.

25:08.360 --> 25:11.560
It brings up an interesting point and also a scary area though, because I think a lot

25:11.560 --> 25:16.440
of us are more comfortable with the idea that that's what Nazis are.

25:16.440 --> 25:22.080
The behavior you just described, that they're like sims that when they see a person of color,

25:22.080 --> 25:26.800
they go, nope, nope, nope, because, because that sort of assures their destruction.

25:26.800 --> 25:30.960
It's like, it's like looking at MP3s and being like, no, thank you as a record industry.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.680
You're just like, okay, see you.

25:32.680 --> 25:37.600
And that's, that's, that's, that's, that's the hard part is because on that same episode,

25:37.600 --> 25:38.600
so how do that happen?

25:38.600 --> 25:41.680
And got, you know, I got my life friend, like someone friend to lynch me and stuff like

25:41.680 --> 25:42.680
that.

25:42.680 --> 25:46.280
And to people, to people who sent lynch me.

25:46.280 --> 25:52.080
And then I went to this other guy's house named Dan, and, and Dan Burnside, and I spent

25:52.080 --> 25:56.800
time with him and his family, his wife hating me, but he was, we, we built this weird relationship

25:56.800 --> 26:00.600
where he had these fucked up views that we were totally different on.

26:00.600 --> 26:04.240
But then he was like, actually not a bad guy, it's just he had these messed up views.

26:04.240 --> 26:06.280
And that's where the weirdness came into it.

26:06.280 --> 26:11.720
Like, I'm trying to, you know, do this documentary with this guy where people like, he's a likable

26:11.720 --> 26:18.000
guy, but he just has these horrible views, and it's that weird thing of, you know, isn't

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
it?

26:19.000 --> 26:22.760
I mean, we, we, we keep on, we had a guy that did a documentary, we didn't have the subject

26:22.760 --> 26:26.040
of it, and I can't remember his name and I should, but the subject of the documentary

26:26.040 --> 26:30.960
is this guy that in America for decades, that's been his thing is that he counsels probably

26:30.960 --> 26:35.360
maybe with people you've sat down with, that he, he, he sits with them.

26:35.360 --> 26:42.720
He's a black guy and he, and he collects their old uniforms and all this stuff, and he has

26:42.720 --> 26:43.720
a big collection of them.

26:43.720 --> 26:44.720
You saw that documentary?

26:44.720 --> 26:47.520
Yeah, I didn't see the documentary, but I heard about it, but you should, you gotta

26:47.520 --> 26:48.520
watch.

26:48.520 --> 26:49.520
Fucking crazy.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.520
He done people I did with as well.

26:50.520 --> 26:51.520
Right.

26:51.520 --> 26:54.680
That name almost sounds familiar, that Burnside guy, because I remember that going like, that

26:54.680 --> 26:59.160
seems like a name that Rob Schrab would name something in a comic book, because it, the,

26:59.160 --> 27:04.880
the, the, but isn't that the scarier thing, or I'll speak for myself, that is the scarier

27:04.880 --> 27:05.880
thing.

27:05.880 --> 27:09.640
It's that, it's these, it's these Twitter conversations.

27:09.640 --> 27:16.760
It's the idea that, that, oh, they, they're not just like keystone cops that live in basements

27:16.760 --> 27:21.440
and shine their jackboots under posters of Hitler that they only cover up if their Jewish

27:21.440 --> 27:23.480
meter reader comes over.

27:23.480 --> 27:30.640
Like they're, they're, they're, they're out among us and they're, they're comfortable

27:30.640 --> 27:35.960
enough buying fruit loops in a grocery store full of people of different races.

27:35.960 --> 27:41.520
But it does, that doesn't make them jump up on a box and say, I can't be in this room,

27:41.520 --> 27:44.120
there's too many black people.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.640
Because that would be easy to handle.

27:46.640 --> 27:51.400
And what's, what's scary is that they're just like, ha, ha, ha, and joking around with

27:51.400 --> 27:53.640
us and influencing elections.

27:53.640 --> 27:57.800
And like that, now that's, I mean, I wonder what's scary about that is that it's like,

27:57.800 --> 28:02.840
it forces us to do battle with ourselves because all of a sudden there's not just a cobra action

28:02.840 --> 28:05.920
figure that you can throw down and say G.I. Joe won.

28:05.920 --> 28:06.920
Yeah, yeah.

28:06.920 --> 28:11.320
Well, I mean, it's, it's, it's the sort of, it, it, because being with like the Nazis

28:11.320 --> 28:15.000
and the Klan and all of that, right, the dudes that wear the robe and wear the swastika

28:15.000 --> 28:18.840
tisha and walk around and go, like those guys,

28:18.840 --> 28:19.840
Shut up, shut up.

28:19.840 --> 28:20.840
That's what they do.

28:20.840 --> 28:24.880
Like, because I'm an expert in the Nazis, mirror, mirror, mirror, that's some secret.

28:24.880 --> 28:33.480
Hey, language there for you, but anyway, dear Harmontown, I have never been more offended.

28:33.480 --> 28:39.640
As I sit here in my compound sharpening my bayonet, I regret that America has fallen

28:39.640 --> 28:41.360
to bigotry.

28:41.360 --> 28:49.320
Your guest, Jamali Maddox, did an impression of a Nazi anyway, sorry.

28:49.320 --> 28:54.080
But it's like, yeah, so it's like those dudes, uh, uh, funny enough aren't the scary ones

28:54.080 --> 28:56.120
because you know where they are.

28:56.120 --> 28:58.520
And to be completely honest with you, man, that's what's making, what's what kind of

28:58.520 --> 29:03.640
weird about it from, because I was making a film, I didn't want to be like, oh my God,

29:03.640 --> 29:05.920
worry about these eight guys, you know what I mean?

29:05.920 --> 29:10.200
Because it is just eight guys doing, it's burning a swastika badly, right?

29:10.200 --> 29:15.400
But it's the, it is the guys who then don't suits, you gotta worry about.

29:15.400 --> 29:20.280
It's the guys that have, that have decided that's a marketplace and who maybe half believe

29:20.280 --> 29:23.360
those guys and half don't and who at any rate are like, I like votes.

29:23.360 --> 29:29.200
Because you can't, you can't, the thing is like, the thing of like this whole idea of

29:29.200 --> 29:33.360
a white utopia where you're gonna walk around and only see other white people go, who a good

29:33.360 --> 29:34.360
white dude?

29:34.360 --> 29:35.360
It doesn't exist.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.360
A good white dude?

29:36.360 --> 29:37.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.360
Okay, like it's a little different.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.360
The guy, the leader of that group lived in Detroit.

29:41.360 --> 29:47.200
How, how can you live in Detroit and not once interact with anyone from any other race?

29:47.200 --> 29:48.200
You can't.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.200
It's literally important.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.200
You would not eat.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.200
Well, what you see in that documentary, when you watch it.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.880
You wouldn't eat, you wouldn't do nothing.

29:53.880 --> 29:56.960
When you watch that documentary, there's two things you might, you might notice.

29:56.960 --> 30:02.400
One is that all of these guys get tired, like, like, I think racism and misogyny both kind

30:02.400 --> 30:07.640
of like, you don't become a good person, but you can get bored with hatred.

30:07.640 --> 30:13.680
Like you, especially if you are well healed, like prosperity and age, even independent

30:13.680 --> 30:17.960
of each other, but especially combined, there's nothing, there's nothing more harmless than

30:17.960 --> 30:23.080
an old, rich, former monster.

30:23.080 --> 30:25.800
They're just like, did it, nailed it, bye.

30:25.800 --> 30:29.280
I'm gonna eat some Cheetos and play some video games and it's like they might not have atoned

30:29.280 --> 30:32.640
with anything in themselves when the most active parts of their lives were, you know,

30:32.640 --> 30:33.640
the most important.

30:33.640 --> 30:37.920
And so you see a lot of that and you also see young people of color asking the question

30:37.920 --> 30:43.160
of this older activist who, you know, is so admirable and is, it is, it is willingness

30:43.160 --> 30:45.240
to go into the mouth of a lion like that.

30:45.240 --> 30:50.200
But then they're saying like, so you made 50 old ex-racist friends and we're out here

30:50.200 --> 30:54.480
in the streets inhaling tear gas with cops that say they're not racist and all this stuff.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.800
So it's like, that's why you got to watch it because it's just fucking amazing.

30:56.800 --> 31:00.520
It's one of those things where there's no heroes or villains, you just walk away bummed

31:00.520 --> 31:02.720
and confused and like freaking out.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.720
And then you go back to England and you're like, fuck them.

31:04.720 --> 31:07.720
Well, I've done the episode in England, it was the same show over there.

31:07.720 --> 31:08.720
Yeah, yeah.

31:08.720 --> 31:09.720
Well, no, it might be worse.

31:09.720 --> 31:10.720
I don't know.

31:10.720 --> 31:11.720
I guess that's the other place that we can go.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.440
So I wanted to talk to you about that.

31:13.440 --> 31:15.560
Can I ask you a quick question?

31:15.560 --> 31:19.680
When you do the show, without revealing too much about what the secret, the magic trick

31:19.680 --> 31:24.040
of making that show great, you know, like in the production side of it, but how much,

31:24.040 --> 31:28.840
like, did that bar know you were coming or did you guys just roll up on that KKK bar

31:28.840 --> 31:29.840
in Georgia?

31:29.840 --> 31:37.800
Well, this was the issue is that, so my producers had to go to the bar the night before because

31:37.800 --> 31:40.920
they were planning this swastika line because what it was, it was all these different white

31:40.920 --> 31:45.120
power groups coming together to form a super white power group and then they were coming

31:45.120 --> 31:46.120
together.

31:46.120 --> 31:47.120
Racist Voltron?

31:47.120 --> 31:48.120
Yeah.

31:48.120 --> 31:49.120
Yeah.

31:49.120 --> 31:50.120
Racist Voltron.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.120
Just go together.

31:51.120 --> 31:53.080
It's like the Holocaust never happened, right?

31:53.080 --> 31:55.440
As I say, we aren't the world.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.080
We can't all be the right arm.

31:57.080 --> 32:00.320
We can't all be the right arm.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.320
Somebody has to be a leg.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.320
That's funny.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.320
It's shit.

32:03.320 --> 32:05.840
But yeah, so, yeah, so it was all, it was all that.

32:05.840 --> 32:10.160
And then so then they, so they had to go over there because our connect, our link was

32:10.160 --> 32:15.040
the leader of the national socialist movement and he said we could.

32:15.040 --> 32:17.880
And then when we got there, they were like, so he was like, hey, I've got this documentary

32:17.880 --> 32:18.880
from group.

32:18.880 --> 32:19.880
Okay, okay.

32:19.880 --> 32:23.480
And the presenters, Brownskin, dude, yeah, he ain't coming in here, right?

32:23.480 --> 32:26.360
So then my producers had to go and my producers there for like, I was trying to convince them

32:26.360 --> 32:27.360
to let me in.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.680
But the one guy knew that you were coming in.

32:28.680 --> 32:32.080
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he knew I was coming and then he got outnumbered in

32:32.080 --> 32:37.240
votes, prepared that vote and so then they were like, he can't come inside or he can't

32:37.240 --> 32:38.240
come.

32:38.240 --> 32:43.920
And then the guy came anyway with a deck chair and beers, like I knew they wouldn't let me

32:43.920 --> 32:44.920
in.

32:44.920 --> 32:49.080
So I was watching the swastika line from the side of the road and then the guy came in

32:49.080 --> 32:52.560
because the owner wanted us to move the cars into the lot bit.

32:52.560 --> 32:53.920
And so the guy came in.

32:53.920 --> 32:54.920
So then they knew I was there.

32:54.920 --> 33:01.080
Wait, so there's a thousand Nazis doing a parade and you're a lone black dude with binoculars

33:01.080 --> 33:02.080
across the street?

33:02.080 --> 33:03.080
Yeah.

33:03.080 --> 33:05.360
That seems like, like, seems a little risky.

33:05.360 --> 33:06.360
That's fucking hilarious.

33:06.360 --> 33:11.720
Yeah, man, no, I've done some dumb shit, but like, yeah, I don't matter, I don't, I

33:11.720 --> 33:12.720
do not.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.320
I look back because like people ask me like, one of the main questions I get asked is,

33:15.320 --> 33:16.320
was you scared?

33:16.320 --> 33:19.920
And it's like, not at the time, only when I get back to the hotel, because I've done

33:19.920 --> 33:20.920
dumb shit.

33:20.920 --> 33:26.440
Like, I went to this white power music festival in Ukraine and we didn't have security, like

33:26.440 --> 33:27.440
no security.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.880
Like, and I remember they, our vice asked me, do I want security?

33:29.880 --> 33:34.280
And I was like, no, man, no, Karoy, and I don't know Karoy, but I wanted to stay

33:34.280 --> 33:38.320
uncomfortable at the time, and we just got, and then people like threatened, you know,

33:38.320 --> 33:42.880
it's like a mad, you know, some mad things that I did, I wanted, I don't, yeah.

33:42.880 --> 33:46.360
What is it propelling you then, if fear isn't stopping you?

33:46.360 --> 33:47.480
What is propelling you?

33:47.480 --> 33:48.480
Is it?

33:48.480 --> 33:54.520
And what is it by the time I realized what I was doing, I already signed the contract

33:54.520 --> 33:58.320
to do the show, and you're like, I got to do the show right.

33:58.320 --> 34:03.320
That would make me, if I, if I like accidentally sold myself as some kind of like social evil

34:03.320 --> 34:05.600
conneval, I would commit to it.

34:05.600 --> 34:09.840
I mean, if I was like, because I'd be like, fuck, I had the only thing worse than eating

34:09.840 --> 34:17.240
this tarantula egg is looking like a dip shit, like, like, but like, this is like, I want

34:17.240 --> 34:18.240
to keep it funny.

34:18.240 --> 34:19.240
So I'm sorry.

34:19.240 --> 34:20.240
It's going to take a dip here.

34:20.240 --> 34:21.840
They're used to dips on this show.

34:21.840 --> 34:22.840
I appreciate it.

34:22.840 --> 34:27.120
But what, what, what kind of drove me with the show is hosted by a dip?

34:27.120 --> 34:28.120
Okay, Bruno.

34:28.120 --> 34:31.560
It's like, I've done like the first episode and it was kind of light and then the second

34:31.560 --> 34:33.480
episode got really heavy.

34:33.480 --> 34:39.640
And all I remember is that like the reason I carried on like, and was willing to do crazy

34:39.640 --> 34:45.200
shit and dumb shit was like, I went to that refugee camp and it was like the most oppressive

34:45.200 --> 34:46.200
thing I ever seen in my life.

34:46.200 --> 34:47.200
You know what I'm saying?

34:47.200 --> 34:48.200
It was like sadness.

34:48.200 --> 34:52.400
Like, I, you know, I've never seen like sad, sad as shit in my life.

34:52.400 --> 34:56.680
And if I want to, if I'm not so sad, don't matter what spectrum on the political debate

34:56.680 --> 35:02.680
you are, if you're right-wing or left-wing, that you can't negate how sad that thing is.

35:02.680 --> 35:07.960
And that kind of, and for people to sort of, not even just say, look, we don't want them

35:07.960 --> 35:12.800
here for economic reasons and, you know, and those reasons, which, you know, which is debatable,

35:12.800 --> 35:16.240
you know, you can have those debates, but it's the people saying, fuck them, they're

35:16.240 --> 35:17.240
dirty.

35:17.240 --> 35:22.760
You know, that they're dirty and I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't not then go and, and

35:22.760 --> 35:25.400
try and understand why the fuck they think like that.

35:25.400 --> 35:26.400
Right.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.920
That's what I'm talking to that feels like that.

35:27.920 --> 35:30.880
It's, it's all people that are only reading about it on Facebook, right?

35:30.880 --> 35:32.360
Nobody that's ever come that close to.

35:32.360 --> 35:33.360
No, of course.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.360
Of course.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.360
I mean, yeah, there's that, there's that as well.

35:35.360 --> 35:43.160
But, you know, it's like, I know being there is way more heartfelt and, you know, visually

35:43.160 --> 35:45.400
crazy and you dare and you, you feel it.

35:45.400 --> 35:48.320
But even like watching that show on YouTube, I can't look at that and then be like, fuck

35:48.320 --> 35:49.320
them.

35:49.320 --> 35:50.320
You know what I'm saying?

35:50.320 --> 35:55.360
No, no, my therapist has alerted me to the fact that your, the cells in your body, including

35:55.360 --> 36:02.080
the cells that react to light and symbolism and things like, your body doesn't have a

36:02.080 --> 36:07.360
gland that filters for Facebook and YouTube or film and TV.

36:07.360 --> 36:12.640
Your body, if it sees what is unmistakably a man who's been shot by a police officer

36:12.640 --> 36:17.780
and the gun is trembling in the cop's hand while his wife behind the camera is taping

36:17.780 --> 36:21.160
at his kids in the back seat and the blood seeps through his clothing.

36:21.160 --> 36:26.160
And you try to go to work that day and just get your world's greatest grandpa coffee mug

36:26.160 --> 36:34.440
and like, like, like we act like that's different, way more different than I saw a guy get shot

36:34.440 --> 36:36.160
today and watched him die.

36:36.160 --> 36:40.400
Like, like we, there may be some little difference because it was on Facebook and you could close

36:40.400 --> 36:41.400
the laptop.

36:41.400 --> 36:49.160
But your body experienced trauma and we, anyways, whatever, I, I, I, I explain things.

36:49.160 --> 36:55.160
The, but, but, um, the, the, when you went, you went to a refugee camp, what I'm curious

36:55.160 --> 37:00.280
about is because I, I feel like we keep hearing about this refugee crisis.

37:00.280 --> 37:05.280
Now, the crisis is that a bunch of people need to get the fuck out of somewhere where

37:05.280 --> 37:06.720
they're going to die, right?

37:06.720 --> 37:12.040
And then you see transcripts of Trump talking to the Australian PM and it's like, he's

37:12.040 --> 37:18.200
like, it's, it's 1200 people that Obama made a deal with to take in and like, like, like,

37:18.200 --> 37:22.640
there's, there's people all over the place that need to get the hell out of dodge.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.960
And like, I'm not trying to get out of soapbox.

37:25.960 --> 37:29.960
What I'm trying to wrap my mind around is it's, it's sort of like this, the thing we

37:29.960 --> 37:34.400
have in America where we have this like pedophile thing where there's a chart of like how much

37:34.400 --> 37:39.840
we think about pedophilia and it doesn't correlate to a chart of pedophilia.

37:39.840 --> 37:43.480
And I'm wondering about this refugee thing, like how big is the problem?

37:43.480 --> 37:48.800
And the other thing I'm wondering is when you go to the site where you are face to

37:48.800 --> 37:56.000
face with a refugee, is there anyone in that area that is either that, that, that isn't

37:56.000 --> 38:01.200
a paid to toe the line of like keeping them miserable?

38:01.200 --> 38:02.200
Yeah.

38:02.200 --> 38:05.480
Like, like that person just has to, that, that's their job.

38:05.480 --> 38:08.760
If you ask that person, they have to tell you, this is my job.

38:08.760 --> 38:13.440
Is there anybody, there's nobody around there that's going, yeah, keep them out.

38:13.440 --> 38:18.200
I mean, do you know, sure, this is, it's that kind of show.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.200
Oh yeah.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.040
That's, that's, I was like, shit.

38:21.040 --> 38:29.480
Well, first of all, are you going to attack me?

38:29.480 --> 38:30.680
Wait, wait, wait.

38:30.680 --> 38:36.320
You know, I was just sounded like you said Matthew McConaughey, but my name is Matthew

38:36.320 --> 38:37.320
McConaughey.

38:37.320 --> 38:38.320
What's up, brother?

38:38.320 --> 38:39.560
Wait, it's not, it's not your real name.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.880
Wait, it's your, your name is close to that, but it's not.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.640
My name is Matthew McConaughey.

38:43.640 --> 38:44.640
Oh, McConaughey.

38:44.640 --> 38:45.640
McConaughey.

38:45.640 --> 38:46.640
Okay.

38:46.640 --> 38:47.640
Okay.

38:47.640 --> 38:48.640
Yeah.

38:48.640 --> 38:49.640
All right.

38:49.640 --> 38:50.640
All right.

38:50.640 --> 38:51.640
All right.

38:51.640 --> 38:52.640
All right.

38:52.640 --> 38:53.640
Without revealing anything that's going to get me arrested, I used to serve in special

38:53.640 --> 38:54.920
operations from 2001 to 2007.

38:54.920 --> 38:56.920
Can you explain what special operations is?

38:56.920 --> 39:01.160
I was a ranger in third battalion 75th Ranger Regiment.

39:01.160 --> 39:04.360
Can you explain what that is?

39:04.360 --> 39:09.880
Imagine that we've, most of us have just, from playing with Legos for 30 years.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.000
He was in a super elite branch of the army.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Okay.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.280
Like the, the highly trained, like the Navy's had to seal.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.400
I mean, I can, I can sugarcoat it.

39:16.400 --> 39:18.800
I was really good at killing people.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.880
The rangers are like the Navy seals up the army.

39:20.880 --> 39:21.880
Well, okay.

39:21.880 --> 39:22.880
That's offensive.

39:22.880 --> 39:23.880
That's offensive.

39:23.880 --> 39:24.880
Let's say that's another podcast.

39:24.880 --> 39:25.880
Okay.

39:25.880 --> 39:26.880
All right.

39:26.880 --> 39:27.880
All right.

39:27.880 --> 39:28.880
You, you said it best.

39:28.880 --> 39:29.880
Your, your point is you, you've had elite access to.

39:29.880 --> 39:30.880
Right.

39:30.880 --> 39:31.880
No, not even that.

39:31.880 --> 39:35.520
Actually, before that I was in the big army, which is like the guys that join at a high

39:35.520 --> 39:37.240
school and I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing.

39:37.240 --> 39:38.760
I'm going to play saxophone in the army band.

39:38.760 --> 39:39.760
Oh, wait.

39:39.760 --> 39:40.760
I'm in the infantry.

39:40.760 --> 39:41.760
Here we go.

39:41.760 --> 39:42.760
I feel like this might break into it.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.780
Like a thing about, I know the truth about the Illuminati, man.

39:45.780 --> 39:50.680
So I went to a Turkish refugee camp in Iraq in 2000.

39:50.680 --> 39:51.680
When did we invade Iraq?

39:51.680 --> 39:52.680
Yeah.

39:52.680 --> 39:55.000
It's been a long time for me.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
It's been rough.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.120
I mean, we've never stopped invading Iraq.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.120
I think I know.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.120
Yeah.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.120
When did that stop?

40:01.120 --> 40:02.120
It's sort of like visiting your parents.

40:02.120 --> 40:03.120
I don't know.

40:03.120 --> 40:04.120
We just do it when we need laundry done.

40:04.120 --> 40:07.680
I have so many friends who are still there and it's like, okay, good.

40:07.680 --> 40:11.200
So yeah, I went there during the invasion invasion and then about like seven months

40:11.200 --> 40:15.520
in, we went to, I hope I'm not going to get killed for this.

40:15.520 --> 40:20.160
We went to the Turkish, there's a Turkish refugee camp in Iraq and those people were

40:20.160 --> 40:24.760
so scared and really at the end of the day, what it comes down to is people are afraid.

40:24.760 --> 40:30.960
Like those people, they had a small armament there, like weapons that we didn't even have.

40:30.960 --> 40:36.400
Like 50 cal, they had at least three MAH deuces there, 50 caliber machine guns.

40:36.400 --> 40:41.760
They had machine guns left over from World War II that I, which, you know, if I could

40:41.760 --> 40:47.000
have saved them, I could be rich right now, but I didn't because I was young and dumb.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.320
Anyways, it was really interesting to talk to these people.

40:50.320 --> 40:53.080
I bought an owl off of one of them for 40 bucks.

40:53.080 --> 40:56.680
It was pretty cool.

40:56.680 --> 41:01.000
Was your job to keep people from getting somewhere?

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
No.

41:02.000 --> 41:09.200
I used to show up every day, not die and not kill anybody, I guess, but sometimes, you

41:09.200 --> 41:10.200
know.

41:10.200 --> 41:11.200
That's my job.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.200
I know.

41:12.200 --> 41:13.200
Yeah, exactly, yeah.

41:13.200 --> 41:26.360
We were just, we're talking about refugee, like, we're talking about refugee, like, the

41:26.360 --> 41:31.960
fact that we're like, we're having these moral quandaries about whether we let in refugees

41:31.960 --> 41:34.960
whether we judge them, police them, shut them out, and what I was saying was...

41:34.960 --> 41:38.400
How many refugee camps are there in, where you live, that's up in the hills?

41:38.400 --> 41:39.400
What is that?

41:39.400 --> 41:40.400
That's a...

41:40.400 --> 41:41.400
I drive up there all the time.

41:41.400 --> 41:42.400
What is that?

41:42.400 --> 41:43.400
That's a...

41:43.400 --> 41:44.400
A little speed list.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.400
A little speed list.

41:45.400 --> 41:46.400
Yeah.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.400
How many refugee camps are there up there?

41:47.400 --> 41:48.400
There's none.

41:48.400 --> 41:53.120
I think there's like a monastery that I'm a little suspicious of, but I think they mainly

41:53.120 --> 41:54.120
do aromatherapy.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.120
Here's...

41:55.120 --> 41:56.120
Here's Katy Perry bought that, you know.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.120
She did.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.120
Oh, really?

41:58.120 --> 41:59.120
Yeah.

41:59.120 --> 42:00.120
Here's my input on that is that...

42:00.120 --> 42:05.080
So I've been to refugee camps, I bought an owl off of a kid that was probably something

42:05.080 --> 42:07.920
like, you know, five foot nothing, 40 bucks.

42:07.920 --> 42:08.920
The owl...

42:08.920 --> 42:09.920
And he tried to...

42:09.920 --> 42:10.920
The kid...

42:10.920 --> 42:11.920
Was it a five foot owl or was it...?

42:11.920 --> 42:12.920
His name was Harry Potter.

42:12.920 --> 42:13.920
That...

42:13.920 --> 42:14.920
All right, can you...

42:14.920 --> 42:15.920
And he was...

42:15.920 --> 42:16.920
No, no.

42:16.920 --> 42:17.920
And he tried to...

42:17.920 --> 42:18.920
And he tried to...

42:18.920 --> 42:19.920
So far, this sounds like a pretty cool refugee camp.

42:19.920 --> 42:20.920
It was pretty cool.

42:20.920 --> 42:23.920
You could buy guns with an owl?

42:23.920 --> 42:24.920
Yeah.

42:24.920 --> 42:25.920
Oh, yeah.

42:25.920 --> 42:30.000
They had a ton of weapons, but at the end of the day, what it was, is they were scared,

42:30.000 --> 42:34.440
like, they had no idea what was going on and we had just invaded their country, which they

42:34.440 --> 42:35.440
already...

42:35.440 --> 42:38.440
It wasn't even their country, like, they were...

42:38.440 --> 42:42.800
They were guests in the country that was hosting them, that we...

42:42.800 --> 42:45.920
They escaped from another country, and they...

42:45.920 --> 42:53.560
This other country that we had largely reputed as being, well, it was led by Tyrant, but

42:53.560 --> 42:54.560
they were scared.

42:54.560 --> 42:55.560
It's fear.

42:55.560 --> 42:59.960
At the end of the day, fear drives all human emotion, it drives all human activity, like,

42:59.960 --> 43:00.960
it's...

43:00.960 --> 43:03.200
And at the end of the day, like, you can...

43:03.200 --> 43:08.240
You can talk shit about every human being that you want to, but fear is, like, what

43:08.240 --> 43:09.240
drives us.

43:09.240 --> 43:13.960
It's so overpowering, we're not better than fear, we're not better than what created

43:13.960 --> 43:14.960
us.

43:14.960 --> 43:18.640
I'm still trying to place you on a map of ideology, though, because I felt like we were

43:18.640 --> 43:21.640
just talking about, like, something that didn't even really have a gender to it.

43:21.640 --> 43:22.640
Oh, yeah, and I'm crazy, yeah.

43:22.640 --> 43:26.920
I went to the DNC, I went to the Democratic National Convention, and I was a burnicrat,

43:26.920 --> 43:30.840
and I got chewed out by a bunch of people that hated me.

43:30.840 --> 43:31.840
But you...

43:31.840 --> 43:32.840
Woo!

43:32.840 --> 43:35.320
But I also used to kill people for a living, and I was really good at it.

43:35.320 --> 43:38.680
You presented yourself as if you had a kind of counterpoint, like, we were talking about

43:38.680 --> 43:39.680
how refugee camps are bad.

43:39.680 --> 43:40.680
I'm talking about refugee camps.

43:40.680 --> 43:41.680
You're like...

43:41.680 --> 43:44.560
Well, I've got a thing or two about that, and you're like, you've got to remember, they're

43:44.560 --> 43:49.680
shitty places, and everyone's scared, and I bought an owl.

43:49.680 --> 43:50.960
And I don't...

43:50.960 --> 43:51.960
That's fair.

43:51.960 --> 43:56.120
And he said, if he could do one thing different, he would have bought more weapons from them,

43:56.120 --> 43:57.120
because he would be rich.

43:57.120 --> 43:58.120
That's true.

43:58.120 --> 43:59.640
How many weapons have you bought from refugee camps in your life?

43:59.640 --> 44:03.080
That's the second time you've done that, that thing, like, are you high-roading me about

44:03.080 --> 44:04.080
refugee camps?

44:04.080 --> 44:05.640
Like, how many have I done this?

44:05.640 --> 44:06.640
Just the one.

44:06.640 --> 44:07.640
Yeah.

44:07.640 --> 44:08.640
Well, you're not embracing...

44:08.640 --> 44:09.640
That's fair.

44:09.640 --> 44:11.960
...the profit of possibilities of going to a refugee camp.

44:11.960 --> 44:12.960
But what...

44:12.960 --> 44:18.360
I was providing my input as to actual refugee camps in a war zone, like the real world that

44:18.360 --> 44:19.480
we don't live in currently.

44:19.480 --> 44:20.640
They're bad places.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.120
Their refugee camps are bad places.

44:22.120 --> 44:23.120
Let's see if we're...

44:23.120 --> 44:24.120
Well, are they?

44:24.120 --> 44:25.120
Let's see if we're Matthew McConnelly.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.120
Matthew McConnelly.

44:26.120 --> 44:27.120
Thank you, sir.

44:27.120 --> 44:28.120
Special ops.

44:28.120 --> 44:29.120
Thank you, Dan.

44:29.120 --> 44:30.120
Let me say one point, though.

44:30.120 --> 44:31.120
Oh, sir, sir, sir.

44:31.120 --> 44:32.120
Fuck that guy.

44:32.120 --> 44:33.120
That guy.

44:33.120 --> 44:35.120
That kind of scared me a bit.

44:35.120 --> 44:36.120
But...

44:36.120 --> 44:37.120
A little bit.

44:37.120 --> 44:39.120
But, like, it's like, I went to two.

44:39.120 --> 44:41.120
I went one in Sweden, and I went one in...

44:41.120 --> 44:42.120
I went to the Cannes one.

44:42.120 --> 44:43.120
Not the Cannes one.

44:43.120 --> 44:44.120
That's the film thing.

44:44.120 --> 44:46.120
I went to the one in Calais.

44:46.120 --> 44:47.120
I went to the refugee camp in Calais.

44:47.120 --> 44:52.560
I went to the one in Sweden, was, you know, there was a lot more sort of hope there, and

44:52.560 --> 44:56.840
there's a lot more, you know, people sort of thaw at the end of the tunnel in terms of,

44:56.840 --> 44:57.840
you know...

44:57.840 --> 44:59.840
Well, yeah, because Swedish refugees, I mean, what are they, fleeing massage?

44:59.840 --> 45:00.840
Yeah.

45:00.840 --> 45:01.840
No, these are...

45:01.840 --> 45:02.840
This is a refugee camp.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.240
I mean, these are entitled people.

45:04.240 --> 45:05.840
I got to get out of Sweden.

45:05.840 --> 45:08.600
This chocolate is too creamy.

45:08.600 --> 45:16.040
I got to build my own furniture.

45:16.040 --> 45:17.560
Are these Syrian refugees, I'm assuming?

45:17.560 --> 45:19.640
Yeah, these are from all over.

45:19.640 --> 45:23.520
But then, while I will say that, so there is, you know, I did see a difference, you know,

45:23.520 --> 45:26.920
and I went to the one in Calais, the day it burned down.

45:26.920 --> 45:28.240
And that was the fucked up one.

45:28.240 --> 45:30.640
That's the one that kind of changed my life a bit, watching that.

45:30.640 --> 45:33.200
Why did the camp burn down?

45:33.200 --> 45:37.560
Because there's two stories that I heard that day.

45:37.560 --> 45:38.560
Number one is...

45:38.560 --> 45:41.960
Because basically it was the day that they were kicking everyone out to bulldoze it over.

45:41.960 --> 45:45.640
And one of the accounts was that the refugees were burning down their homes, and the account

45:45.640 --> 45:52.360
number two was that there was sort of a nationalist firing, nationalist burning down their homes.

45:52.360 --> 45:58.320
And so there was two counteracted, but like I saw one guy, who my camera guy knew, who

45:58.320 --> 45:59.320
was...

45:59.320 --> 46:04.240
So my camera guy's walking and he sees this guy and he just hugs him, and this guy, he's

46:04.240 --> 46:08.040
looked like he hasn't like fucking slept for like a year, and he's just covered in

46:08.040 --> 46:09.040
soot.

46:09.040 --> 46:10.040
Hasn't worked for a year?

46:10.040 --> 46:12.600
He's slept for a year, and he's covered in dust and dirt.

46:12.600 --> 46:17.360
And he was saying how like, wear all these fires, he's just like a volunteer fire guy,

46:17.360 --> 46:21.520
and he's going and fighting these fires that are being kicked off, because all that generators

46:21.520 --> 46:24.120
and stuff, so it's just catching the light in that.

46:24.120 --> 46:26.120
I don't understand brave people.

46:26.120 --> 46:30.600
And that includes Matthew Mcconnelly and you, and some journalists we've had up here.

46:30.600 --> 46:38.360
My hat's off to anybody that serves and that is fleeing.

46:38.360 --> 46:40.280
There was a quote I saw on Twitter.

46:40.280 --> 46:43.720
It's just black and goes to a KKK bar in Georgia.

46:43.720 --> 46:44.720
That's fucking...

46:44.720 --> 46:45.720
That's not brave.

46:45.720 --> 46:46.720
That's just nuts.

46:46.720 --> 46:47.720
Yeah, that's just dumb.

46:47.720 --> 46:48.720
There's no bravery.

46:48.720 --> 46:53.680
I think bravery is kind of like, you know, all I did was just make a mediocre hour show.

46:53.680 --> 46:57.840
There wasn't like, oh, bravery, you know, I was cutting this line, bro.

46:57.840 --> 47:01.840
You've been doing stand-up and I've seen it and it's like, you're very good.

47:01.840 --> 47:06.760
Like you've been doing it for like four years and like, but that's not your roots, right?

47:06.760 --> 47:07.760
Or is it?

47:07.760 --> 47:08.760
Like what was your...

47:08.760 --> 47:12.640
Like before I'd done this, the documentary, I was just stand-up.

47:12.640 --> 47:19.600
I tried to act and I was awful, man, and I probably delivered the lines like, give me

47:19.600 --> 47:20.600
your money now.

47:20.600 --> 47:21.600
Now.

47:21.600 --> 47:24.840
It was fucking horrible.

47:24.840 --> 47:25.840
And then...

47:25.840 --> 47:26.840
But yeah, I was at stand-up, man.

47:26.840 --> 47:32.320
So I done my first show at 16 and I got brutal stage and then I didn't do it again until

47:32.320 --> 47:33.320
I was like 18.

47:33.320 --> 47:34.320
And then I...

47:34.320 --> 47:36.320
You must be quite young now, then.

47:36.320 --> 47:37.320
I'm 26 now.

47:37.320 --> 47:38.320
Okay.

47:38.320 --> 47:39.320
22-year-olds don't think so.

47:39.320 --> 47:40.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:40.320 --> 47:41.320
That's like a weird thing.

47:41.320 --> 47:44.320
It's like the oldest I've been.

47:44.320 --> 47:45.320
Yeah, exactly.

47:45.320 --> 47:48.320
So I can't look at it until you're like, oh, I'm really...

47:48.320 --> 47:49.320
I'm just the oldest.

47:49.320 --> 47:50.320
This is the furthest I've lived.

47:50.320 --> 47:55.320
I remember 27 is the worst because you're too old to complain but you're too young to

47:55.320 --> 47:56.320
complain about that.

47:56.320 --> 47:57.320
How old are you?

47:57.320 --> 48:01.840
And so at 27, you just spend a year at the object of judgment of everyone older and

48:01.840 --> 48:02.840
younger than you.

48:02.840 --> 48:06.960
They're like, fuck you, old slash young man.

48:06.960 --> 48:10.040
I like that you sort of ruin my next birthday.

48:10.040 --> 48:11.040
Yeah.

48:11.040 --> 48:12.040
But I will tell you this.

48:12.040 --> 48:13.040
You see your next birthday?

48:13.040 --> 48:14.400
That whole year is going to be terrible.

48:14.400 --> 48:21.280
But 27, I think, is the best, like short of 29, but 27 I think is a little better because

48:21.280 --> 48:23.320
it's syllabically more complicated.

48:23.320 --> 48:29.440
I find syllabically complicated, odd-numbered birthdays are fucking fantastic for when

48:29.440 --> 48:35.280
you want to say, I'm blank years old, I don't have to put up with this shit, whether it's

48:35.280 --> 48:42.120
helping someone move, driving to the airport, or buying a Honda, whatever, you can just

48:42.120 --> 48:43.120
randomly apply it.

48:43.120 --> 48:47.920
If somebody is like, well, maybe you should get this car and you're like, I'm 27 years

48:47.920 --> 48:49.360
old, I don't need that fucking car.

48:49.360 --> 48:52.160
And they're like, wow, that sounds like he's true.

48:52.160 --> 48:54.640
It's a great point in your foot down here.

48:54.640 --> 48:59.360
I'm constantly saying now I'm 44 years old, it just doesn't sound legit.

48:59.360 --> 49:00.360
They're like, so?

49:00.360 --> 49:02.400
Yeah, you still got to do shit before we go.

49:02.400 --> 49:09.640
Talk to us when you're 47, wait, I'm 47 years old, we're having a clown on the show.

49:09.640 --> 49:13.240
People will be like, no, Dan, he's close to death.

49:13.240 --> 49:14.760
He speaks with that power.

49:14.760 --> 49:17.440
Spencer, how old are you?

49:17.440 --> 49:22.400
I'm 28, no, 27, 8, 28.

49:22.400 --> 49:29.200
See, 27 is a birthday you don't even want to admit, so you just want to put leaves on

49:29.200 --> 49:30.200
it and run away.

49:30.200 --> 49:34.120
He took a year less life to say, I'm 28, I'll take a year less.

49:34.120 --> 49:36.760
I think we'd all skip 27 if we could, for some reason.

49:36.760 --> 49:40.960
But there's that one thing you can just say at Hot Topic, I'm 27 years old, yes, get

49:40.960 --> 49:42.440
out the XL's.

49:42.440 --> 49:48.760
Hey, Jamali, how many of the episodes, you said you did six already, you got 10 more

49:48.760 --> 49:49.760
coming up, you said?

49:49.760 --> 49:52.240
Oh yeah, down off the first was to say that, but fuck I could say.

49:52.240 --> 49:55.240
Yeah, I'm doing, I might be doing more, I think.

49:55.240 --> 49:56.760
Oh, are we allowed to talk about that?

49:56.760 --> 49:57.760
I don't know, man.

49:57.760 --> 49:58.760
There was one thing, you were telling me...

49:58.760 --> 50:01.560
I don't read the contract, but I'm sure they'll sue me if I fuck it up.

50:01.560 --> 50:02.560
I'm sorry.

50:02.560 --> 50:03.560
Can you talk?

50:03.560 --> 50:04.560
I don't read that.

50:04.560 --> 50:06.040
What if I just got your show cancelled?

50:06.040 --> 50:07.040
Yeah.

50:07.040 --> 50:08.040
That'd be amazing.

50:08.040 --> 50:12.480
There was a guy you were telling me about today, when we first met.

50:12.480 --> 50:14.360
You told me about the fish guy, but...

50:14.360 --> 50:15.360
Oh yeah, not after that.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.360
Yeah, okay, yeah.

50:16.360 --> 50:20.200
You'll have to wait for the fish guy, and you won't know who's the fish guy, because

50:20.200 --> 50:22.480
the fish had nothing to do with it.

50:22.480 --> 50:28.680
But so, just as an ambassador of the UK, like what, so since November, but also it's like

50:28.680 --> 50:32.760
it was like, Brexit was happening, and then November was happening in the States, the

50:32.760 --> 50:36.920
elections were happening around the same time, but there was like, Trump was tweeting, they're

50:36.920 --> 50:42.360
going to call me Mr. Brexit, because I think his point was, it's kind of like talking about

50:42.360 --> 50:43.360
a dolphin.

50:43.360 --> 50:50.160
I think what he was saying was like, everyone keeps assuming that nationalism doesn't have

50:50.160 --> 50:57.120
a foothold, but pretty soon they're going to say, I'm also a nationalist, like guess

50:57.120 --> 50:58.120
what I'm sorry.

50:58.120 --> 51:05.840
I'm not curious, like on the world stage now, it was easy three years ago to say, you didn't

51:05.840 --> 51:15.080
even have to ask a Canadian or an Englander, or an Englishman, or any of these other yahoes.

51:15.080 --> 51:18.080
You never had to say like, what do you think about America, because you knew the answer

51:18.080 --> 51:23.280
would be like, pfft, not America, pfft, and you'd be like, you're jealous.

51:23.280 --> 51:29.880
Now it's actually, the irony of nationalism, it seems to me, is that it's like, we're all

51:29.880 --> 51:34.400
experimenting on a global scale, this is happening all over the world, all the countries are

51:34.400 --> 51:41.920
becoming more childish, more secure, more isolated, which actually makes the conversations

51:41.920 --> 51:46.800
like, what do you think about America, more interesting and like less predictable, because

51:46.800 --> 51:51.640
it's like, what has been happening over there?

51:51.640 --> 51:54.000
How do you guys, we're over here, like kind of going like-

51:54.000 --> 51:56.520
Are you asking me, how do we process America now in England?

51:56.520 --> 51:59.520
Yeah, like what's, I mean, obviously the answer is that you can't make a statement for all

51:59.520 --> 52:03.400
of England, but with circles you run in, or like the, I don't know, like what's the-

52:03.400 --> 52:11.680
Well, I mean, we kind of had the rise of sort of like really more hard to write politics

52:11.680 --> 52:16.560
in England, and I think it's sort of been, I think it's the same as, and I think people

52:16.560 --> 52:22.000
I speak to kind of understand that like, a large pusher of the more right-wing ideas

52:22.000 --> 52:27.240
is because of the large push of the other left-wing ideas, you know, and I think when

52:27.240 --> 52:32.600
both of those ideas get bigger, they sort of react on the others, and everyone's left

52:32.600 --> 52:35.800
in the center, you know what I'm saying, it's like, you know, other like, you know, I'm

52:35.800 --> 52:40.040
not far left-wing, but I'm not far right-wing, you know, there's people in the middle, and

52:40.040 --> 52:44.320
that debate's never spoken about, and it's like, we've always kind of had this idea

52:44.320 --> 52:49.000
that you people were crazy, that we always have, like, your coaxes are too big, your

52:49.000 --> 52:51.880
food's too big, everything's just too big, like, we just think you're mental when you're

52:51.880 --> 52:52.880
so big.

52:52.880 --> 52:53.880
You were like the Las Vegas of the planet.

52:53.880 --> 52:55.440
Yeah, yeah, like, we think you're crazy.

52:55.440 --> 52:58.480
Everything's legal over there, it's better to have a TV show there.

52:58.480 --> 53:02.360
You know, now we think, you know, it's, so it's like, you know, I wasn't mad shocked

53:02.360 --> 53:06.320
when Trump got in power, you know what I mean, I wasn't, you know, me personally, I wasn't

53:06.320 --> 53:10.120
shocked, you know what I'm saying, because I think what Trump does, because I kind of

53:10.120 --> 53:12.720
felt it in England of there, it's sort of like-

53:12.720 --> 53:16.440
Oh boy, it's that time when Spencer's car gets broken into.

53:16.440 --> 53:17.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:17.440 --> 53:19.840
I could go take care of that.

53:19.840 --> 53:23.320
Is that a serious thing that happens?

53:23.320 --> 53:25.480
Yeah, it really is his car.

53:25.480 --> 53:26.480
Oh, is it really?

53:26.480 --> 53:30.560
I thought he was just using that as a cheap opportunity to go get high.

53:30.560 --> 53:31.560
Yeah, yeah, right.

53:31.560 --> 53:35.200
That could, I mean, Spencer would have like an egg timer, yeah, that his car, he tells

53:35.200 --> 53:40.920
his car, call me out to get high at ten minutes before.

53:40.920 --> 53:43.240
The weed, the weed is way too strong here.

53:43.240 --> 53:44.240
The weed is strong here.

53:44.240 --> 53:45.240
Oh, the weed is ridiculous here.

53:45.240 --> 53:46.240
Oh, because you guys are like-

53:46.240 --> 53:47.240
It blew my mind.

53:47.240 --> 53:48.240
Yeah.

53:48.240 --> 53:50.240
I, I, no, don't cheer it, it's disgusting.

53:50.240 --> 53:51.240
I hate it.

53:51.240 --> 53:52.240
Nah, man.

53:52.240 --> 53:53.240
Nah, that weed is too much, man.

53:53.240 --> 53:54.240
This is not, you can't, you can't enjoy it.

53:54.240 --> 53:55.240
It's just, I can't.

53:55.240 --> 53:56.240
Yeah.

53:56.240 --> 53:57.240
I'm saying, I-

53:57.240 --> 54:05.240
Well, I, I agree with that, but I'm from the country of 44, like, like, like, like, but

54:05.240 --> 54:10.720
it's, yeah, I, I, I, I, I, fuck Harmon, get your shit together.

54:10.720 --> 54:17.080
Um, there, there are people from the Rangers here tonight, um, fucking, have some fucking

54:17.080 --> 54:18.080
integrity.

54:18.080 --> 54:23.640
Um, I, I got a, I got a tin of mints that were like, like, it's like, they're like,

54:23.640 --> 54:28.920
it is like, there's this gourmet kind of like, that's the nice thing about legalization

54:28.920 --> 54:34.680
is like, now there's like, this guy gave me, he's, he's shooting some stuff with Starburns

54:34.680 --> 54:38.920
and it's about drugs and so some people, some companies gave him some stuff and I get like

54:38.920 --> 54:46.440
this gourmet, like, like, like gilded, like, 80s dark chocolate kind of, like, wrapping

54:46.440 --> 54:52.040
and like, there's a, there's mints and they're like, you suck on one and you get just barely

54:52.040 --> 54:58.120
high, like, for two hours and it's, anyways, that wasn't worth commenting on.

54:58.120 --> 55:02.640
There is, there is a little, I mean, I think that the kids these days, which you are one,

55:02.640 --> 55:07.520
but you've, you've invaded American soil, but I think the kids your age here, they're

55:07.520 --> 55:12.720
like, they're like, they're fucking desensitized or something, like, they're smoking some monster

55:12.720 --> 55:13.720
gonj raw.

55:13.720 --> 55:18.840
I just, I just don't think we should be grown by dudes in lab coats, like, I don't want

55:18.840 --> 55:20.280
to smoke that, that's, that's too much.

55:20.280 --> 55:24.480
I mean, I feel it should be legally okay for that stuff to happen, but it should happen

55:24.480 --> 55:28.440
like, it should happen while Richard Attenborough is watching and like, like, yeah, it should

55:28.440 --> 55:34.280
have, there should be a different thing, like, I, I, I mean, weed got you high, that's how

55:34.280 --> 55:37.720
we found it, you know, like, it didn't need to be like cross-bredged.

55:37.720 --> 55:40.600
I'm not saying, I'm not, I'm not saying we should make it legal, but I'm just saying

55:40.600 --> 55:42.560
it for my, for my personal taste is too much.

55:42.560 --> 55:43.560
Yeah, no, that's all.

55:43.560 --> 55:44.560
I'm saying the same thing.

55:44.560 --> 55:45.560
And I'm saying, hey.

55:45.560 --> 55:46.560
Oh, cool.

55:46.560 --> 55:47.560
I'll have another debate on legalization.

55:47.560 --> 55:48.560
We're on the same side, bro.

55:48.560 --> 55:51.840
I'm saying once it's, once it's so legal that it's all good everywhere, I'm saying there

55:51.840 --> 55:56.760
will be the emergence of these things that I am old enough to find, which is like, casual.

55:56.760 --> 55:57.760
The old dude weed.

55:57.760 --> 56:03.240
Perhaps me eating you out should be a little more psychedelic, you know, like, just kind

56:03.240 --> 56:10.760
of like, forensic files amount of weed, you know, like, like, that was a pair of bifocals

56:10.760 --> 56:13.280
should make tonight's quite an event.

56:13.280 --> 56:20.720
I went into a, Jamali, I traveled a comedy group, and Greg Poops is a comic, if you're

56:20.720 --> 56:27.160
aware of him, and Greg, Greg smokes the strongest weed on the planet Earth, as he says, he

56:27.160 --> 56:34.200
is like, where do you, where do you get that he goes from Dagobah, if I give his weed

56:34.200 --> 56:36.000
a stern look, I'm fucking dead.

56:36.000 --> 56:41.640
Like it's, it's, but we walked into a, we're up in up, uh, upstate Washington, where the

56:41.640 --> 56:46.040
weed is very, that was like, it's totally freely, reparationally available.

56:46.040 --> 56:50.600
And we walked in there and this is all the, it's like 10 a.m. and these four like stoner

56:50.600 --> 56:54.600
dudes that are working there, who all clearly know the show that we're on.

56:54.600 --> 57:00.360
And they just, they're all really high in the morning, like, oh, so Greg is like buying

57:00.360 --> 57:04.760
like the funkiest, hardest ass, he's like, I'll take one of those, five of these, a double

57:04.760 --> 57:09.400
whammy, a triple walnut, like he knows all the, all the, all the, you know, the whammy

57:09.400 --> 57:11.840
and the walnuts, man.

57:11.840 --> 57:17.240
That might have been the ice cream place, but, uh, but, uh, I, I had to talk to the

57:17.240 --> 57:19.880
guy, I'm like, what's the weakest shit?

57:19.880 --> 57:24.000
And, and, and, and, and what's the sticiest, like the, just the worst, like what, like,

57:24.000 --> 57:25.160
what wouldn't you smoke?

57:25.160 --> 57:28.800
And Greg had to walk over to him and like explain, like, like slum it.

57:28.800 --> 57:32.200
Like, like, what's stuff that you would be bummed out if somebody offered it to you?

57:32.200 --> 57:35.400
And I took that and I went and got some chocolates at this place in Seattle and I sat in my

57:35.400 --> 57:36.680
hotel room, it was the best.

57:36.680 --> 57:37.680
Yeah.

57:37.680 --> 57:41.920
I, I was as high as I could possibly be, but like, Greg stuff, forget about it.

57:41.920 --> 57:42.920
Yeah.

57:42.920 --> 57:46.520
I just, I, if I go to Portland or somebody, I got, I got, I just, I just go like, I'm,

57:46.520 --> 57:48.800
my grandma has back pain.

57:48.800 --> 57:56.160
And then they give me what gets me high enough to like have a, end up on TMZ.

57:56.160 --> 57:57.160
Yes, yes, yes.

57:57.160 --> 57:58.160
My, my, my, my wish.

57:58.160 --> 58:00.160
My pair of kids in the story flow.

58:00.160 --> 58:01.920
I hit you with a lot of stuff though.

58:01.920 --> 58:04.520
You're like, wait, am I what?

58:04.520 --> 58:10.500
But I did want to ask you, like, so, so just now let's talk about comedy, but relating

58:10.500 --> 58:11.500
to politics.

58:11.500 --> 58:16.760
Because here you are, you're half my age, you're British, and, and, but now we're living

58:16.760 --> 58:17.760
through this time.

58:17.760 --> 58:25.760
So, your perspective is totally different from mine, but like, what is a comedic creative's

58:25.760 --> 58:33.760
obligation or what, what is a good philosophy to follow when shit hits the fan on a global

58:33.760 --> 58:35.480
scale this much?

58:35.480 --> 58:44.760
Because I can't, I just keep falling back on, if it seems like you're in a history book,

58:44.760 --> 58:48.960
then politics aren't politics, they're current events.

58:48.960 --> 58:53.800
If it doesn't seem that way, but, but I don't know if how much of that is a refraction of

58:53.800 --> 58:57.800
like, but, but you're, so what's, what have you thought about this, like, how political

58:57.800 --> 58:58.800
am I allowed to be?

58:58.800 --> 59:02.480
Yeah, no, I, I, do you know what, like when it comes to comedy and writing comedy is,

59:02.480 --> 59:08.520
is, it's like, I try to, to just be honest about how I feel about that thing and not

59:08.520 --> 59:12.240
try and tell the line of, of being like, I'm going to say this because I think this has

59:12.240 --> 59:13.240
a moral obligation.

59:13.240 --> 59:15.240
Do you know what I'm saying?

59:15.240 --> 59:16.240
I don't think I'm morally obligated to wear anything.

59:16.240 --> 59:17.240
Right.

59:17.240 --> 59:18.240
You know what I'm saying?

59:18.240 --> 59:19.240
Like I'm a free person.

59:19.240 --> 59:22.280
And, and like, my person, and my thing as well is like, I'm not even like, I'm willing

59:22.280 --> 59:24.760
to hear a point of view I don't agree with in comedy sometimes.

59:24.760 --> 59:25.760
Do you know what I mean?

59:25.760 --> 59:26.760
Like I find that shit interesting.

59:26.760 --> 59:27.760
Do you know what I'm saying?

59:27.760 --> 59:30.120
So if there's a dude who has a totally different political view to me and there's a comedian

59:30.120 --> 59:33.960
out there who has that view, like say it, you know, as long as it's funny and, you know,

59:33.960 --> 59:37.360
say it, like that's, that's your freedom to do it, you know, like I, I believe in freedom

59:37.360 --> 59:38.360
in comedy.

59:38.360 --> 59:43.360
So like me personally, I don't think I'm morally obligated that like, oh, these things are happening.

59:43.360 --> 59:46.360
And I must put on my black turtleneck and smoke a cigarette.

59:46.360 --> 59:48.360
And so I say, what's wrong with the world, man?

59:48.360 --> 59:49.360
Like, I don't know.

59:49.360 --> 59:50.360
I'm a comedian.

59:50.360 --> 59:54.240
It's a weird area because some, some comics have the philosophy that I do understand,

59:54.240 --> 59:59.720
which is that comedy is its own political party where we're like, we're supposed to

59:59.720 --> 01:00:04.560
be funny above and beyond anything else and anything that impedes in humor is like that's

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.560
fucking Satan.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.560
You should do it.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:11.880
Like, I think if you have the, the, the opinion and the intelligence and the, and the, and

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.560
the point of view and funny, then put it out there.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.560
Do you know what I mean?

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.560
I think that's great.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.560
And I'm going to hear it.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.560
You know what I'm saying?

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.320
But at the same time, I don't think, I think, I think there's also, I don't think every

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.640
comedian should now be Bill Hicks.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:24.480
I think, I think if someone does one line, it's kind of, you know, when you're one line,

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.480
you know what I'm saying?

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.480
I don't think.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.480
Well, you definitely have to be, yeah, you have to be honest.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.760
Like, like, so there's, there probably are comics out there that are probably regrettably

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:38.840
being like, you know what, I'm, I, I have this opinion and that opinion, like, but everyone's

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840
just going to boo me.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.120
You know, and that person probably, you're, you're like, you, you and I wouldn't want

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:48.480
that person to pre-sensor themselves, but we would want them to try to figure out it

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.480
to be funny.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.480
Do you have a question?

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:55.560
You see, like, if I'm not over here, is there, is it, is it, is it harder to talk about Trump

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.200
than it was to talk about Bush?

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.000
Uh, well, if you talked about Bush, this is my perception.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.040
Could it both, like, quiet?

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.280
If you talked about Bush, now, but there's a million variables here.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.920
But if you, in my perception, if you talked about Bush, you were being, you're bringing

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:15.160
politics into your comedy and it, it, it was like needless.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.160
But maybe, maybe.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.240
Well, like, there was a band called the Dixie Chicks, uh, there still is probably, uh, and

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:25.760
they were, they're, they're, uh, they're liberal-ish and they were performing in Texas, I think,

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.280
and they said that he's not my president, we're not proud of the president, and they

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.840
got all sorts of shit.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:34.080
If you, if you go on stage now and don't talk shit about Trump, like, that, that, like,

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.080
the show wasn't a good show.

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.080
Like, like, you, you're required to get up and talk shit about this guy.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.240
It was something really funny and ironic about that, that it was braver to be political when

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:47.800
we were talking about, you know, like, when politics meant a little more boring because

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:52.240
we had things managed and then there'd be like, drone strike here or an invasion there

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.400
and we, it was all manageable through Ted Koppel and all this stuff.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.160
So, so if you were a rock band and you came out and said, we're going to do some stuff

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.760
from our new album, but also I want to talk about dangling chads.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.360
There might be like a bunch of booze, you know, they're, they're, they're, they're like

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:11.360
booze from people going like, fuck you, Leonard Skinner, I wanted to, I just wanted to, I

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:16.920
was making up bands and relationships, but, but, but the, um, that's, I guess that's kind

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:21.840
of my question, which probably a 26-year-old, uh, maybe doesn't even have the answer to,

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:27.320
which is like, how different is it now and how does that difference equate to an obligation?

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:32.720
Because sometimes I sit in my five bedroom house in Los Feliz and I go, nothing has changed

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.880
for me.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:38.320
So why would my, uh, material change?

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:43.560
And then I go, you were talking about how you don't wash your ass, like you need to

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.360
keep talking about what you're thinking.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.080
You just said that, like talking about Bush was less important.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.080
It's all subjective.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.320
It's less important to me.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.440
So that's part of what it is, is that I feel like, I kind of like, I feel, it's a little

01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:01.080
bit of like a, what do you call it, a, uh, an atonement, a, uh, confession, uh, when,

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:08.280
when, when it's, uh, uh, making up for, like, like, I, like, I, uh, amendments.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.280
Yeah.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.280
But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.280
Penance, she said.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.280
Penance, but amendments also.

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:18.280
Do you think it's, but do you think if people, but my word also, that rhymed with your word.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:22.360
Well, but do you think, do you think that if people start talking about Trump, right?

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.840
And it's sort of the thing of like, all right, we all got to talk about Trump.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.560
Do you think then it becomes like a fad and like people just start doing it for the sake

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.560
of doing it.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:30.560
And then it kind of loses it.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.560
Sure.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.560
When you see.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.560
But I think, yeah, I think that's the danger with all.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.560
Yeah.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.880
That danger always looms with every, any issue that everyone's talking about is that I think

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:44.040
people who are like, it's, it's, it's so, so hard to unbraid from like, if I were to,

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:50.320
if I were to say, hey, Trump's a piece of shit, and let's say I get three people booing.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:55.080
One person might be booing because they're like, your comedy's lazy.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.720
Another person might be booing because they're like, I voted for him and I want to forget

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.120
about it.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:03.680
I was wrong and I came out to drown my sorrows and laughter.

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:07.000
Stop reminding me I'm an idiot.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.960
And then a third person might be a ghost.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:18.160
Who's trying to give me a treasure map, and I don't know, it's, it's, it's, it's sort

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:23.000
of like, it's making me very curious because it's not like I'm like haunting the stand-up

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
clubs these days.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.520
I'm, I'm kind of like, I'm, I'm vastly approaching the threshold where it's like, like, according

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.320
to my predecessors, the baby boomers, it's like, I'm getting to an age where I can kind

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.520
of clock out and be like, ah, world's a mess.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.520
Give me some ice cream.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:43.840
You know, funny enough, like a lot of people I know kind of don't even really do the Brexit

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.840
thing anymore.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:48.400
Because I think a lot of them feel it's been like played out a lot of them.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.600
Oh, that's the third boo.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:54.760
The third boo is the person like, like, like my audience might, like a lot of us are like,

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:59.800
I, I, please, like, I watched John Oliver, I watched, I watched, I watched, I watched my

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.500
Twitter feed, like, like, like, like, just keep talking about how you jerked off of the

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:06.480
sharpie in your butt once, like, like, you know, like, like, like, like, you don't have

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.840
anything new to say about it, but yeah, continue.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.760
No, no, no, no, no, you've pretty much summed up, man, that's it.

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.160
I mean, I'm done.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.160
No.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:19.040
Yeah, like, you know, it's such, it's such, it's just, I've never, and like, and you know,

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.960
I've not been in comedy for that many years, but I can't, you know, remember a time where

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.960
it's been like this.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:24.960
You know what I mean?

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.760
Like, this is, this is, this is a weird fucking time, and it's hard navigating as a human

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.920
being and navigating as a comedian, you know what I'm saying, and sort of what, what my

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:38.720
arts got to reflect, you know, and, you know, as what I do see a lot of is, and I don't

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:43.240
know if this is right, but, you know, I think there's some great comedians who do it, and

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:48.600
I've sort of done it sometimes myself is people kind of see what the issue was of why maybe

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:53.520
Trump got elected or why Brexit happened and attack that, and not necessarily attack the

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:59.000
thing or the voters or the, the, you know, the image of what, you know, Trump as this

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.040
is that one dude, you know, they're trying to attack the things of why that happened,

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.840
you know, because there's so many reasons of why that this is happening, you know, and

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:10.720
it's, and I think, I think some of it lies on economics and all of that stuff that I'm

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:15.200
not intelligent enough to understand, but I think it also lies in social shit, you know,

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:20.400
I think, I think, you know, we, we spent a long time of telling people to, to, to shut

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.760
up if we don't agree with them.

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.360
I think that's happened for a little while now, but being honest, there's-

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:27.640
It's crazy how the internet is what actually has made that the most possible.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:28.640
Yeah.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.760
I mean, I well thought, if you told me, if a Martian came down and pitched the technology

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:34.720
to me and said, everyone will be connected, I'd be like, oh, so there will be a little

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.720
less binary thing.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:38.720
Yeah.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:39.720
No.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.720
This act, it's crazy.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.040
It's, it's, it's like, like, we are obsessed now with firing this person, get rid of that

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.040
prayer.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.040
Like, we, we, we really-

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.040
Words hurt.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.040
Yeah.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.120
The thing is that we live in this weird spectrum where it's like, it's like, it's like, it's

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.840
like, you know, you've got to, you've got one side of just like, say nothing, words hurt.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.840
Right.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.840
It's like, why can't I say nigger?

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.560
And it's like, why can't there be a middle ground though?

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:01.560
Like, you know what I'm saying?

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.560
Like, why can't we-

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.560
Look, say nothing.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.560
Words hurt.

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.560
I'm just saying the words.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.560
You know what I mean?

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:07.560
That's the problem.

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:12.560
Also, in England, that word means diaper.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.560
It's just a, it's a form of marble.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:16.560
Yeah.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.560
You know what I'm saying?

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.560
You know what I'm saying?

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:19.560
That as well.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.560
Yeah.

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.320
But yeah, that, that, it's the, it's this, we, we, we, we were having all these debates

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:27.000
about like what you can say, what you can't say, and all it's like, that, that was the

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.240
other thing about that documentary that I, that you have to watch.

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.240
It's 9-11.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:36.840
Was that, was that an accusation or something?

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:42.880
He has a lot of stand-up bits driven by how he, he looks a little bit like Osama bin

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880
Laden.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.880
Yeah.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.560
But we, we probably should have, I probably should have done that concept rather than

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.680
a cool guy to sing that no one's ever seen.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:58.800
But yeah, I don't know, I was, I, I, it's, it's, god damn it, it's, it's fucking, it's

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.920
something that nobody could have predicted is the fact that we would actually connect

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:07.080
to each other telepathically and that that would actually usher in an age of, of like

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:12.200
a really kind of weird like pre-Columbus suspicion of the other.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:18.480
Like it's, it's almost, it's like, it, it, we're, we're, I feel it in my own bones.

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:25.720
Like I, I'm a really bright open minded guy that grew up on the internet, but we now just

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:35.320
like, we've, I feel like I have been indoctrinated into scanning information on screens through

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:40.840
a, a, a, a chip of, is this person an enemy or an ally?

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:47.480
And if so, and then the flow chart proceeds from there, which is so dangerous and, and

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:54.160
so profits only the worst of the bad guys probably some level of coexisting, I guess

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.160
that.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.240
I mean, because, because that's the thing is that in that documentary, there's these

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:03.960
young black activists who are sitting across from this guy and one, and, and, and he says,

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.520
do you think these people can change?

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.440
Do you think a white racist can change?

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.640
And one of the guys kind of reflexively goes like, no.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.040
And they're like, whole fuck, because that's how we all feel about the enemy.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:18.920
Don't approach them as if they're people that can change because like liberals in America

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:24.040
are like, I'm fucking so sick of this goddamn fucking suck in the dick of these fucking like,

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:28.000
like the, what are the fuck people you told me I forgot and Trump's my punishment for

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
forgetting them?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Ooh, can I listen to you some more?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.440
Well, they abuse us and go like, ooh, snowflake, that feeling's meekie boo boo.

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:35.440
You won.

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:36.440
Fuck you.

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.440
I'm the troll now.

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.440
You Nazi pick.

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.440
All right.

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.440
All right.

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:43.520
But yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's heightened times.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:51.040
We are in more danger of a, we revert to fight or flight or really fight and to fight.

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.520
Like we have nowhere to go.

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:56.840
But so I asked you a question and then I answered it.

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.840
Yeah.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.840
Great budget.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.840
I mean, you asked the question and you answered it way more articulate and I will work.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.840
I'll probably do one word on that.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.840
I don't know.

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:05.840
I'm upset.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:09.040
I feel like, is this, is this interesting for you guys?

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.040
Seriously.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.040
You are great audience.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.600
I could, usually they go like, it's 9-eleven and then like sometimes when there's like

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.800
a thoughtful guest, they're like, it's, it's 9-eleven.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.800
They're, they're, they're, they're mostly engrossed.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:20.800
It's weird.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.960
I got, you know, I don't want to be thrown in this spectrum now of faultfulness.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.400
You know, like I still, I still, you know, because it's, because I, what you said, the

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.040
world was like, what do you think your role is?

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:31.680
Like I still want to talk about, you know, like weird places I've come.

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.200
Like I still want to, you know, I still want to, you know, talk about.

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.200
Well, I have a great idea.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.200
Why don't you come back?

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.680
You're here for a while working on your ratio.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:38.680
You should come back.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.680
Yeah.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.680
I'm going to talk about all kinds of stuff.

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.680
Let's hear it for Jamali Maddox coming out here.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:45.680
Jamali Maddox.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:56.760
Watch his show, Hate Thy Neighbor.

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.520
We really have to promote that show or we violate his visa.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.520
You have to watch Hate Thy Neighbor.

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.520
Yeah.

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.520
It sounds awesome.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.520
Hate Thy Neighbor.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.520
It's a great title.

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.520
The visa thing is really complicated.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.440
You ever talked to a, a, a UK person that comes over here.

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.760
Like, I remember when John Oliver would come over to do community, it was like so fucking

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:11.760
complicated.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.760
It's weird.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.760
It's weird.

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.760
Who can get, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, who gets citizenship?

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.760
Yeah.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:22.080
Because the last time people just left England, they started, they started another country

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.560
and told them to go, fuck off.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.160
They've been, they've been hurt before.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:30.600
I had Ludwig Gorinsson who did all the scorer for communities, Swedish, Swedish, am I going

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.600
to offend him?

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:32.600
Is that where he's from?

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.600
Swedish.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:40.560
And I had to keep, I had to, like, sign a thing that, that verified that he was a genius

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.000
because he was in a genius visa because he was like a visa that said, like, like, he's

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.360
not stealing a jarb, you know, like, like, like, you can't find a composer like this

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:50.360
in the States.

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:52.360
You know, you have to, like, sign a letter.

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:57.200
This guy remakes music that I can't believe.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.200
That's how we got Spencer.

01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.200
Yeah.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.200
Exactly.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.760
Spencer's here in a dungeon master visa.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:04.760
Yeah.

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:09.120
I was going to say a genius bar because he worked at the Apple store.

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.120
Okay.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:18.200
So, let's, let's, let's get Levy up here, shall we, Steve Levy, you in the house?

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:26.840
Hi, everybody, what's going on?

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:27.840
How'd you think that went, Steve?

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:28.840
I thought it went great.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.840
It went great.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.840
Yeah, I really like him.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:32.840
Yeah.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:33.840
We, we, like, hit it off as soon as he, as soon as we met.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.840
I know.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:35.840
I'm glad I set that meeting.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:36.840
Yeah.

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:37.840
Oh, you did.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:38.840
That was me?

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:39.840
Okay.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:46.040
Well, maybe I don't like him.

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.040
Too late.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:51.240
I control my fate is what I'm saying, like, all right.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.240
What's going down?

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.360
I'm going to start exercising.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.360
Start exercising.

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.360
Get back on the trip.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.360
I'm going to.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.360
I'm going to.

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:00.880
I, I saw myself from the side.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:02.520
I saw, I saw it.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.520
Which video?

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.520
Don't do that.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:08.960
The Ryan Elder, this guy just music for Rick and Morty, there's a shot of me talking on

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:17.480
the phone from the side sitting and I am a, just a ball of, and that's, if, if you are,

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.480
you're fine.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:24.720
Don't think about, oh, I have to, like, if you're happy, like, like fucking, you're perfect.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:31.840
Like, I have an issue and I'm old and I need to, like, it's about cholesterol for me.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.960
It's not about how I look.

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:35.040
I have a fucking perfect life.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:41.640
If I, if I, if I thought I could live for a thousand years, I wouldn't do anything physically.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.640
It's that I'm worried about.

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:47.120
I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to make it to 69.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.120
I believe you.

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.120
Yes.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.120
Not for the bit.

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.120
Oh.

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:58.120
I can see that roughly people, men who, in America, who have achieved a little bit, like,

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:01.000
they're tending to drop off at 69.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Nice.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:09.080
Like, it's, it's, it's, and then it's like, yeah, I don't want to live to 80 if it means

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.440
I never did acid.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:11.520
I did lots of acid.

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.560
I can take 69.

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.720
How much acid?

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.720
What kills you at 69?

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.720
I don't know.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.720
No.

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.840
I did acid, let's say, eight times in my life.

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.040
Did it, did it change your life?

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:30.320
I had a friend who, he did acid and he was a different person after that experience.

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.800
In a good way or a bad way?

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.320
In the best way, yeah.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.320
Oh really?

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:35.320
Yeah.

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.560
He, he joined the, my buddy, Rangers.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.560
His name is Matthew.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.560
My friend, finally.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:40.560
No, no.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.840
He's like, I got to get out, I got a country to serve and he like left.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:48.720
My friend, Jeremy, he, he grew up in a house.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:55.240
He had two chiropractors and his mom wouldn't let him take any like prescription.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.240
Wait, I'm sorry.

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.640
Did you say he lived between two chiropractors?

01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.760
No, no.

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.400
His parents are two chiro, whatever.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:04.800
Okay, I got, I got, yeah, I don't know.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.240
He wasn't allowed to take prescription medication, so he always lived in fear and we lived in

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:13.120
a bubble town and he always thought he was going to get sick and, and die and we went

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:20.000
to college and there was a day where he did acid with a couple friends of mine and like

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
the world opened up to him.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.720
He started asking questions about like society and religion and like the education system

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:30.840
and just things he never thought about and, you know.

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:35.080
I mean, you see a lot of talk on intervention about, well, you know, pots or gateway and

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:40.400
all this stuff, but I'm like, you know, I will say that I don't want any lawsuits because

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.680
I'm talking to anyone 20 and over.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:50.320
I'm like, acid is a, it's a decent truck stop to stop at, like, just to check out before

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:56.160
you turn 30 because after 30, you're, you, you're going to be like, you're going to

01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:01.280
take acid and you're going to be like, I haven't done my taxes.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:04.800
Why am I doing acid if I didn't do my taxes?

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.040
But when you're 23, like, like, like I, I'm only speaking from my experience.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.720
It was just like, I, I'm the biggest, the word pussy's not really, I'm trying to out

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:21.440
mode that, but like, I was the biggest pussy in the world about, about, about like, like

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:27.680
drugs and stuff, but, but, but, but when I was in my 20s, I was like, what, what, what,

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:36.000
how might this kill me and as a result, plus being lucky, I, I, I, I did acid and mushrooms

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:45.760
and stuff like that and I do think they, they give mushrooms to PTSD people, like PTSD people.

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:50.200
It's like the fucking Fraggle Rock, like there's PTSD people in the corner.

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.560
They're like dozers or whatever.

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:59.600
People with PTSD, they've, they've clinically, I get all my news from NPR, but yeah, that,

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:04.520
that, that, that Silo Simon, like it, it clinically gives you a sense of perspective that until

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:09.600
you get it, you don't have it and that can actually be incredibly helpful for things

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.160
that we haven't otherwise figured out how to treat.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.720
Uh, anyways, explained it to you, explained it to you.

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.200
Spencer, did you ever do the, uh, the acids or the mushrooms?

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.280
No, I haven't done my taxes.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:26.640
No, I was just, what if you do your taxes and then take acid and then it's like, that's

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.640
the best advantage to dream.

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:28.640
You get so high.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.640
Yeah.

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:30.640
I don't know.

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:34.320
You can act, you can actually fly.

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.320
That's awesome.

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.320
It's the only way to celebrate doing your taxes.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:39.560
The first time I did it, I did it with our friend Matt Young and a little back house

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:43.320
in Echo Park and it was like, it was surrounded by trees and it was really safe and he's like

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.320
the perfect guy.

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.320
Mushrooms or acid?

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:46.320
Acid.

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.520
And we, he goes, just do a little bit and he walked me through and he's like the most

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:52.160
like caring, nicest guy and we just, we just sat there and listened to music and it went

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:55.000
outside and like, like looked at the trees and it was like the greatest.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
It was really amazing.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.080
I did it, I did it in, uh, well, my friend Sean McKenna, like we were doing Coke and

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:03.160
he gave me a tiny piece of paper to put this under your tongue and then I asked him what

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:09.800
it was and he said it was, it was acid and that was my first acid trip, but it turned

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:10.800
out okay.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:15.120
And then the second time I did it, I just, I remember being with Frito, my high school

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:18.960
buddy, Dave Frito, who you've met on the show maybe, and we were in Milwaukee and we were

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:29.240
like, we're on acid in my house in Milwaukee and I rented a house and I remember like ending

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:35.560
the night with like, just at the stack of newspapers and we were going through the Family

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:40.600
Circus, uh, comics on acid, it was fucking fantastic.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:41.600
That's good.

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:48.720
It was like, what do you mean, why, why do you, why does it matter if Billy spilt these

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.720
cookies or not?

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:53.840
Like, I don't know, it's just kind of like blows your mind and then, and then Price's

01:18:53.840 --> 01:19:00.760
Right comes out and you're like, what, Price's Right is the most important drug experience

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:04.360
that any young American can have.

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:11.600
When Drew first got it, I went on his advice, he's like, go a little high, go to the audience

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.600
and watch it high.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:19.640
I went to, I went to a Price's Right taping so high, my mom knew I was high from watching

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:29.560
the Price's Right because I was in the audience right between two bidders, that's like that

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:36.160
high, but I'm probably a standard deaf TV because this is my mom in the early 2000s.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:41.040
But you were amazing because she could still see how red my eyes were and how amazed I

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.880
was at the savings.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:47.240
I was sitting right next to you.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:51.240
I was sitting with you and you were kind of being like, I don't know if it was weed paranoia

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:56.720
or social anxiety, but on the way, you looked a little tense, you weren't like, you didn't

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:57.720
seem totally comfortable.

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:58.720
Yeah, it was very high.

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:03.720
And then when people were yelling out, I'm like, yeah, you know how much this thing costs.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:07.600
And he's like, I don't know, I'm like, I don't know, I'm yelling, I'm like, I'm like,

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:08.600
you can get in there.

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:13.480
Also, I think I told you mistakenly, the reason why they sit the guests of Drew or whoever

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:17.200
right behind the bidder's row is because it's actually not a great place to be seen on camera.

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.760
You must have been right in the hole between.

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:24.960
No, I was after my mom showed me, she put it on DVD, I was like, whoops, I looked like

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:29.720
a Jim Brewer character, but I looked like the Jim Brewer character.

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:33.680
But at one point, Dan got swept into it and I think they were bidding on the on the on

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:37.000
the Plinko chips and they didn't know how much this costs or how much that costs.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.440
And Dan was like, it's the kitty litter, it's the kitty litter, it's the kitty litter,

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:41.440
it's cheaper.

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:47.840
I tell her, it's the kitty litter, the kitty litter, you started yelling at the kitty litter

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.560
and then she won it and you were so happy, it was really great.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:52.920
It was really, really good.

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:57.200
It is like, especially through the lens of like now after the elections and stuff and

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:01.000
now the world that we can see that could happen, like, whereas before it might have been like,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.240
you're a tool of the state if you're saying it's fun to sit and get high and watch prices

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:07.200
right, but like, unless you're laughing at the capitalism.

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:11.360
But now I look back and I go, no, that was a wonderful guppy tank for capitalists.

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:16.440
It was like, you could be 20 and get high and pretend shop for the same shit.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.200
Like, when you're, when you're that age, you're like, you're, you're about to go to

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.680
Target and, and comparison shop plungers and stuff.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:27.920
You're going to buy your first plunger and start thinking about what, oh, this plunger

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:31.440
is cheaper, but I might need more later.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:35.560
And it's kind of exciting the, the, the, the anyways, but I went there high as a, as a

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.560
grown man.

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:41.880
And he's like, when that fucking yodeling dude came out and it was like, oh man, when

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:46.080
Hans comes out, as I told you, cause I said, like, we don't know what's going to happen

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.960
because you don't know what the games are going to be.

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:50.800
But I was like, we're praying that, that Cliffhanger comes out.

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:51.800
Is it Cliffhangers?

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:52.800
Cliffhanger.

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.800
Yeah.

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.120
And when, when he came out, you and I, I think we, we embraced.

01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:01.280
That is some fucking, that was designed by like an SS officer that was trying to exploit

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:08.080
THC influence or something, I was like, I said Alpine climber and I'll design the yodels

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:13.320
and like, it was, it's all designed to like freak you out if you're high, but if you're

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:18.240
watching a TV and it's like, cause Bob Barker would go, let's, well, you thought this, let's

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:26.800
take a look and there'd be a pause and then this fucking puppet would go, for no reason.

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.200
There was never any reason for any of the conceits.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:34.040
It would, he'd just be like, let's go to moon of savings and it would only be guessing

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.040
prices of shit, but there'd be craters.

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.040
Fucking genius.

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:43.200
But the one that we went to, she like got the first two like really short, like Hans didn't

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.200
do fucking anything.

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:48.000
He was still at base camp and then the second one went a little bit longer and she missed

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
by a lot.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.640
But like stopped about half way up, she's got, Hans had half the mountain to go with

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:58.680
the final thing and she bid and it wasn't like the crowd kind of went, ooh, I don't

01:22:58.680 --> 01:22:59.680
know about that.

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:03.680
And I was like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:06.000
And you and I were just freaking out.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:14.080
And he went right to the fucking last one and stopped on the very edge and it was bedlam.

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:17.960
It was, it's so loud in there, cause I got to host that for a little while, I announced

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.560
it like to come on down shit and like, you go home with nightmares in your head cause

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:28.920
it's, it's, it's like, it's like the noise of a Beatles concert, but about kitty littering

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:29.920
pleasures.

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:33.640
The most fucked up thing about going to a Price is Right taping, the most fundamentally

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:40.560
fucked up thing is that you're sitting in chairs and your angle of view is so different

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:41.560
from the cameras.

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:47.440
You, you have to go like this to remind yourself that there's that linoleum with the 70s flowers

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.440
on it.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:53.160
Like it's like, it's above your line of sight and the whole, it's like, that's, that's

01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:56.840
if only if you're sitting in the first couple rows, like the stage is like, yeah, humble

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:57.840
brag.

01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:58.840
All right.

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:07.040
Well, speaking of getting really high Spencer, you want to play some, some D&D right now?

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:12.280
And can you have some, can you have some recap lenience and because we, we haven't say, say

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.280
that again.

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:20.640
Can you have some recap lenience because we, I don't remember anything.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:21.640
Jeff and I re-listened.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:22.640
Yeah.

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.280
This is going to be the strictest recap all year.

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.280
Yeah.

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:30.680
We, we didn't do a whole lot, but it took us eight hours to do it.

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:32.280
So it's, it's, it's going to be a pretty easy.

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:33.280
Okay.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.280
Right.

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:35.280
I got it.

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:40.160
You're going to have to drop and give me 30 while I do it because I'm being strict,

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:43.680
which is a quality of recaps.

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:45.680
All right.

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:53.840
Last time they met doctor, no, not a doctor, farmer, Manille and a diarrhea junior ingratiated

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:59.160
him with some carefully timed snacks with Manille on their side.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:06.560
They spent a good 25 minutes haggling over the price of cow carcasses and then eventually

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:13.920
settled on, I think too gold a piece, I don't know, it was a bad deal, but it was good for

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.880
the farmer.

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:21.680
You guys, you made a costume of the cows and went out to be bait towards a creature that

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:26.720
seemed to be attacking at the cows and eating them or killing them.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:32.080
And then it came and, and you guys made a noise, I think and scared it off.

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:34.800
I jumped and yelled.

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:38.160
It was going off away towards a church and we were towards the church.

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:41.040
We were in hot pursuit of this robed flying figure.

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.040
Hot pursuit.

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.040
Now.

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.040
Okay.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.040
All right.

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.720
So I'll go ahead.

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.720
It's evening time.

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.840
You're headed, you're, I mean, you're, you're facing the direction that the creature kind

01:25:54.840 --> 01:26:01.200
of took off in, which is again towards, towards the priory, the church.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.760
And yeah, it, it, it didn't make too much noise or anything.

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.480
You basically only heard it's footsteps.

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:12.160
So we know the direction it went, we're running after it, where we can still kind of see it,

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:13.160
even though it's dark out.

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:17.960
And I, I say we run as fast as we can and not slow ourselves down by dwelling on the

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:25.440
fact that you kind of, he was like 30 feet away from when you sprung your attack.

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.360
I won't, I won't explain my reasoning until later.

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:29.360
Okay.

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:30.360
Okay.

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.360
That's fine.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.360
Yeah.

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.880
Told, told you to wait, told you to wait for it.

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.960
I just had that feeling.

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:38.960
I just felt like we were going to wait and wait and wait.

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.520
And then it was going to go away.

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:44.320
And then Spencer would be like, what do you think happens if you wait that long?

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:47.080
And that's the thing is that that's the same thought I had that caused us to end up burning

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.560
down the poor family's house.

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.320
Like I, it's called metagaming.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.320
Right.

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:56.440
I'm not even trying to punish it, but I'm doing what I do in real life.

01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:02.280
But the good news is even though it took us all day and some of the night to get practice

01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:06.760
and looking like cows, we did find a flying robed figure.

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:08.240
So that's a lead.

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:11.440
So let's, let's, let's, let's, let's asses and elbows towards that figure.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:14.840
We had that whole conversation like Hannah Barbera style.

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:18.040
Backgrounds are the same.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.480
Just keep passing the same burning door.

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:21.640
All right.

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:23.480
You make it back to the priory.

01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:25.320
It's that old stone building.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.320
It's pretty old.

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:29.440
Once again, you see, it seems to be boarded up.

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:34.320
It seems that it's more reinforced than it was before and sitting outside is a Patchens

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:35.320
again.

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:36.320
He's sleeping.

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.320
It looks like patches.

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.320
Yeah.

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.320
He was the first guy.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:42.880
That's the kind of kind of weird faced dude that we met before.

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:48.760
Patchens was a young church boy who is guarding the front exit when he was, that's not the

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:52.320
one that Carlos threw the water on, right?

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.960
No, that was the prior.

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:59.280
That's the episode that we did in a tent at Chris Hardwick's cult.

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.480
The best one.

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:03.080
That was a crazy place, huh?

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.080
It was.

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:05.080
Whatever.

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:06.080
All right.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.280
So are we at Patchens right now?

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:10.280
Well, yeah.

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:12.640
I mean, let's say you're in the clearing outside of the church.

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:15.560
I'll put you at 20 feet off, but he's asleep in a chair.

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.640
But we lost sight of the creature.

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:18.640
Yeah.

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.400
It took, it was really fast.

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:24.840
Like you were running in the direction it went, but it disappeared pretty quick.

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:26.800
But in the direction of the priory.

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.800
Right.

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:30.160
The only buildings in that direction in town.

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:31.160
Yeah.

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:32.160
Okay.

01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:34.280
I go up and I rouse Patchens out of his sleep.

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:35.280
All right.

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.280
You do that.

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:37.280
He wakes up.

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.280
Hey, what's up?

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:39.280
You guys.

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.280
Hey.

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:43.720
We're in hot pursuit of a robed flying figure.

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:46.560
We have reason to believe he's entered the priory.

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:47.560
So we need access.

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:48.560
We need to get in.

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:49.680
I can't get in right now.

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:55.720
They wanted me to guard this place and they kind of just boarded it up inside with me outside.

01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:00.800
When they told you to guard it, what did they tell you to do if anyone attacked the place

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.200
or if you had to give them any news of an impending attack?

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.760
Just not to let anyone in that we were under attack.

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:11.560
So they sentenced you to death, really?

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:14.680
I feel like I should be understanding what you're saying, but I don't.

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.600
We're saying if an attack happens, can you get in yourself?

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:18.600
No, no.

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:19.600
Wait.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.600
No.

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.560
So you've been left out here to die?

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.160
Well, no, I'm guarding.

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:28.440
I mean, in a way, guard duty is always being left out to die somewhere.

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.480
No, that's not true at all.

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:36.640
Guard duty usually, by default, would be someone, that person would have egress, ingress.

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:38.360
You could be guarding from the inside.

01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:39.360
No, I'm not.

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:40.880
I'm not super thrilled about this.

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:41.880
I'm on your side.

01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:44.280
I mean, I'm locked out of the church.

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:47.840
What is the priors' name again?

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:48.840
That's a great name.

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:49.840
Berthold Abernathy.

01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:50.840
Was that it?

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:51.840
Urkel?

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:52.840
Father Abernathy.

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:53.840
Berthold.

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:54.840
Father Urkel Abernathy.

01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:55.840
Or Berthold.

01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:56.840
Berthold.

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.160
Can I tell you something, Patches?

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:07.480
Your management, which is a lower rung of a church we represent, someone in there is

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:08.480
spooky.

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.480
Yeah, probably.

01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:11.320
Something ain't right.

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:14.640
And we the good guys, I don't mean to get urban on you.

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:16.040
All right.

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:22.200
But I'm saying to you, like, if you were our ally and told us how to get in there to investigate,

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:30.000
because we just followed a cattle mutilating floating man right to this spot.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
He's wearing a robe.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.500
I didn't see that.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:33.500
Of course you didn't see it.

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:34.500
You were sleeping.

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:35.500
Oh, right.

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:36.500
Right.

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:37.500
Good point.

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:38.500
Well, yeah.

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:39.500
No one's cut.

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.500
Well, the door's fucked up.

01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:42.000
I mean, we can break it down.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I'll break it down.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.320
No, there's got to be a quieter way in, Patches.

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:46.320
Can we go back?

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.320
Can we go back?

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.840
You seem pretty proud of your guard duty status.

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.240
You were asleep when we got here.

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:55.280
So get off your, I'm not, you know, I'm not good at my job.

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.520
I'm just trying to help.

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.520
Okay.

01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.520
Well, you know what?

01:30:58.520 --> 01:30:59.520
You want to really do something good?

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.120
Want to make up for that?

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:03.440
Work with the A team over here.

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:04.960
We'll never judge you.

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.960
What are you doing?

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:10.040
I thought I was already on your side.

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:13.960
What do you want?

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:16.400
You know what I like about you, Patches, is you're kind of stealthy.

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:20.120
You were stealthy about your guarding, and you're also, you know, all the quiet ways

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.120
to get into the...

01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:24.920
Yeah, that rogue figure probably thought you were just another corpse out in this wasteland.

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:26.880
That was, that was, that was smart of you.

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.080
Like, where are the sewers?

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:35.800
Where's the, where are the, the, the, the, the underage girl shoots?

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:36.800
Huh.

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:41.040
Things you'd expect in an organized religion building.

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:44.240
Um, well, we don't have those.

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.240
Impressive.

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:51.920
Uh, we, uh, can you, can you call out to, uh, Father Abernathy?

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.920
Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:56.600
No, wait, wait, wait.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.600
We want, we want in, don't we?

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:01.320
Yeah, but we could, I mean, I would...

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:02.320
You should, you should light the door on fire.

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.320
That's your move.

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:04.320
It's your signature move.

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:06.320
Father Abernathy!

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:08.320
Father Abernathy!

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.240
I say you should light it on fire.

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.560
Let's, let's, let's give, let's give him a minute.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.680
It's a big priory.

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:15.680
What happens?

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:18.200
You wait, let's say, three minutes or less if you choose to.

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.200
Okay.

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:25.520
I just think you guys, I think that the odds of it being someone inside the priory, and

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:31.840
the odds therefore of it being a church official are high, making this a, uh, a sensitive mission.

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:32.840
A stealth operation.

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:36.840
Less of a hack and slash, more of a infiltrate and celebrate.

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:37.840
All right.

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:38.840
Makes sense.

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:48.360
Uh, I, I exempt, I, should we all kind of split up or examine the, the, the church?

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:51.880
Well Patch is here, I think is holding out on us in ways to get into the priory.

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:55.640
I think there's, I think there's milkshoots, I think there's mail drops, I think there's

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.640
chimneys.

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:57.640
Well, you need to talk.

01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:59.560
Yeah, I, I would agree.

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:02.960
Well, yeah, we could go in the inside.

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:07.160
This, there's, there's multiple buildings that kind of form a perimeter, perimeter around

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:11.360
the inner yard, but then the inner yards, it's got smaller doors.

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.960
They're just kind of people doors.

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:17.120
They're not, they're not so public, you know, they're probably less reinforced.

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:18.120
Who knows.

01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:19.600
Let's do that.

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:23.000
Patches, who's the weirdest of your bosses?

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.680
Like the one who's been behaving recently, the most strangely, the father, he's been

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:28.680
super suspicious.

01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:32.440
I mean, the prior, he's also the father.

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:33.680
There's a lot of redundant church.

01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:37.440
Is he the father prior to being the prior?

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.440
Yeah, yeah.

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:39.440
We'll be right back.

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.440
All right.

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.440
Well, that goes both ways.

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:50.280
I mean, if you were the father of an infiltrated church, you'd be paranoid, but it also, if

01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:54.320
you were a Dracula, you'd be like, does anyone know?

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:55.320
Right.

01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:56.320
All right.

01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:01.040
Patches, lead us into the, the perimeter buildings.

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.040
All right.

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:08.160
He takes you around the right side of the building into, there's kind of a narrow, narrow passage

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:09.160
way.

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:14.040
It's, it's, let's say it's three feet wide and it's covered in like, what do you call

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.040
it?

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:19.600
There's like barrels and all sorts of thing, like, like storage items, boxes that are, that

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:26.360
are holding kind of stuff for horses and yard work, but it's all just piled in kind of precariously

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:30.160
and then over it is a big iron net that's made out of iron chain links.

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:36.120
So it all looks kind of noisy, but there is, you know, you could go through it, it'll just

01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:40.480
be loud or you got to be real careful or something.

01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:44.840
So it's like, it's like an attached garage with a lot of loud stuff in it.

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:48.080
It's like a side yard with a lot of loud stuff in it.

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:50.320
Patches, is there a quieter way to get in here?

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:54.200
Do we, do we have to go be a one man band as we walk in here?

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:59.760
No, we, the cellar access is on the inside, but yeah.

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:04.640
We go in another door, but most of these doors are boarded up.

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.480
Let's see, I'm pretty, I'm pretty stealthy.

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:11.280
My spell loadout was, I did offensive to your number.

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.280
Yeah, I believe so.

01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:13.280
The third one.

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:14.280
Yeah.

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:15.280
I'm not very stealthy.

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.280
Yeah.

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:19.480
I don't really have any magic that can help us.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.480
I mean, I'm a gnome.

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:25.400
Is it easy for me because I'm smaller to kind of like shimmy through this noisy box and

01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:26.400
chain area?

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:27.400
You are smaller.

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:28.400
Yeah.

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.400
All right.

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:30.400
It's too much easier.

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:33.720
Guys, do you want to try some of these boarded doors first, try to pry these off, or do you

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.720
want to go?

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:35.720
I guess one more question.

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:40.280
Patches, is there, are there any functions coming up where, I mean, these doors are boarded

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:45.080
up like these guys are relegated to, they're just going to stay in there and never come

01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:46.080
out.

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:49.160
Are they, are there any town hall meetings coming up where?

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:54.680
Well, there was a big ceremony, but I don't know anything about that.

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:57.880
Tell us about the ceremony.

01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:59.760
I don't know anything about that.

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:02.000
They just said, said it needed to be guarded.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Oh, yeah.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.640
I mean, the ceremony happened in there.

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:05.640
I don't know, man.

01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:10.440
I think you don't know if the ceremony happened in the, I don't think it's happened yet.

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.080
There's a ceremony about to happen.

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:13.080
I don't know, man.

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:14.440
They don't tell me nothing.

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:17.240
This guy, they locked me out of the fucking church.

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.240
We should light that door on fire.

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.240
We got to just get in there.

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.240
Yeah.

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:21.240
And the fire isn't loud, right?

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.400
I, I, fire isn't loud.

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:24.400
What do you wait?

01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:25.400
What are you suggesting?

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:26.400
I don't know.

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.120
We'll light that door on fire and they're like in the basement.

01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:33.080
We can't light, we tried lighting doors on fire.

01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:34.080
It's mostly stuff.

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:35.080
It got us here.

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:40.240
I have the feeling we don't know if here is better than where we were before we started

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:41.240
lighting doors on fire.

01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:42.240
How about this?

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:43.240
I'm an optimist.

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:46.240
Why don't we just stay in this passageway and just dress up like cows again and wait?

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:47.240
All right.

01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:48.240
All right.

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:49.240
Let's, let's, who's stealthy?

01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:50.240
Who's stealthy?

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:51.240
I am a four.

01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:52.240
I'm not very stealthy, but real quick.

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.840
I have the feeling this, this boxes and chain kind of situation is kind of a crude alarm

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:56.840
system, right?

01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:57.840
Sure.

01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:58.840
Well, I mean, it's a de facto one.

01:36:58.840 --> 01:36:59.840
Yeah.

01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:00.840
De facto.

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:01.840
It's like in a video game where, but I'm metagaming.

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:02.840
All right.

01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:03.840
But that's accurate metagaming.

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:04.840
Okay.

01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:07.840
I mean, it's like a, it's like a tough place to crawl through.

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:11.840
You're going to have to impress us like Katherine Stena Jones and you know, I, I, I don't have.

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:16.080
You're going to have to do your little booty move through the, I, I, I have a lot of dexterity,

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.080
not a lot of stealth.

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:18.080
Do you have acrobatics?

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:19.080
Uh, you, you know.

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.080
Oh.

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.080
All right.

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.080
Well, dexterity is good.

01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:33.080
I have some stealth for what's your dexterity to top left 15, I got to teach you how to

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.080
read that.

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.080
Paches.

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:38.480
He's more dexterous than me and he's more stealthy than me.

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:39.480
Yeah.

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.480
No, he should go.

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:41.480
Yeah.

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:42.480
What, what, what do you think I should do?

01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:45.240
I think you start, try to get through and like just see what you see on the opposite

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:46.480
side of this debris here.

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:47.480
All right.

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:51.080
I want to, and then you can tross us a tross as a rope.

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:55.680
It's a, it's a, uh, uh, from an upstairs window, I bet.

01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:56.680
Oh.

01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:57.680
Okay.

01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:06.880
I want to dexterously and stealthily make my way across the room past all the loud metal

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:07.880
stuff.

01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:10.080
You said your dexterity was 15, right?

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:11.080
Yeah.

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:12.080
The roll of dice.

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:13.080
15 plus anything?

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.080
Plus two.

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:15.080
Ooh.

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.080
17.

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:19.480
Uh, the roll of dice will be on my phone.

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:21.080
You're not just being a loof.

01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:22.080
No.

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:25.480
John Favreau needs a GM and you're like, dude.

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:26.980
All right.

01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:27.980
You successfully, yeah.

01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:29.480
No, I left my dice somewhere.

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:30.480
Sorry.

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:34.480
Uh, you successfully sneak through the passageway and make it to the other side.

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:40.600
You're in a large kind of, uh, inner, inner sanctum kind of inner, inner yard area.

01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:43.480
It's a large inner sanctum yard area.

01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:47.480
What do, what else would you go find out?

01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:52.760
There's a place where you can throw us a rope that we can climb up.

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.400
It's a, what's the answer?

01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:55.400
I want to cross, right?

01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:56.400
I didn't go up.

01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.480
No, you're right now.

01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:58.480
You're just across.

01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:59.480
Yeah.

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.480
How far, how far away is he from us right now?

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:02.480
Uh, 20 feet.

01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:03.480
Okay.

01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:04.480
So he's right by us.

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:05.480
Yeah.

01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:06.480
It's just a, it's like a side yard.

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.480
Okay.

01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:08.480
Do you want to try it too?

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:09.480
Should we?

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:10.480
Did it look easy?

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:11.480
Or did you just?

01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:12.480
Is there a cellar door nearby?

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:15.480
Uh, not that you can see.

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.480
Do you see it?

01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:19.480
Do you see any, any other doors over there?

01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:20.480
Look around.

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:21.480
Look around.

01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:22.480
Feel around too.

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:23.480
Examine your surroundings.

01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:24.480
There's always secret stuff.

01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:25.480
All right.

01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:26.480
All right.

01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:30.480
I walk around the perimeter and look for doors.

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:31.480
Um, okay.

01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:32.480
Around the perimeter.

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:33.480
You walk around the perimeter.

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:35.480
You see, you see a door and a staircase.

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:36.480
Yep.

01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:37.480
That's all you see in the yard.

01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:42.480
There's a two, two, uh, horses that are tied up and, uh, they look great.

01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:43.480
Look real nice horses.

01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:46.480
The nicest horses you've seen several days.

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:50.480
Um, you guys, they're the nicest horses I've ever seen out here.

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:51.480
Stay, stay focused.

01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:53.480
You don't, you don't understand.

01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:56.480
We have to let, we have to take these horses with us.

01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:00.480
If we, if we can hear you, people inside can hear you.

01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:03.480
You can't, you don't have a walkie-talkie.

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.480
Whatever that will end up being.

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.480
They're beautiful.

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:09.480
I can't hear you because you're being quiet.

01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:12.480
Does the staircase go up or down?

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:16.480
It goes up.

01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:20.480
You guys, I'm just going to go exploring.

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:21.480
Shhh.

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:28.480
I, I, I, I'm sorry.

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:31.480
I, I'm going to go up.

01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:32.480
Yes, go.

01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.480
But they're so beautiful.

01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:35.480
Stop talking about it.

01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:36.480
Just go.

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:37.480
You have to see.

01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:39.480
If you get caught in there.

01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:42.480
Beautiful golden fur.

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:44.480
Spencer, I go up the stairs.

01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:45.480
All right.

01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:46.480
You do that.

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:47.480
Um, you do that.

01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:48.480
You go up into a room.

01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:53.480
It looks kind of like the room of a, a tavern or an inn kind of.

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:55.480
Uh, it's, it's like from a video game.

01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:59.480
It's a narrow hallway and each side of the hallway is flanked by three doors.

01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:03.480
It seems like it's like a sleeping quarters kind of upstairs room.

01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:07.480
There's so many doors.

01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:08.480
Six even.

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:13.480
Six, six, six doors.

01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:18.480
Let's, let's see what's behind door number three.

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:19.480
Okay.

01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:24.480
Go with your gut, man.

01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.480
Go with your gut.

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.480
All right.

01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:29.480
You open the door.

01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.480
Wait.

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.480
Sorry.

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:32.480
You open the door.

01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:33.480
Oh, it's nice.

01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:34.480
You see a chest.

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:37.480
There's a chest at the floor of a bed.

01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:38.480
Like a treasure chest.

01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:43.480
Well, there's just chests as a more standard form of storage in this world.

01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:45.480
Oh, that's not exciting.

01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:52.480
So there's a chest and there's a bed and there's a person in the bed and they're asleep because

01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:54.480
you're still pretty quiet.

01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:58.480
How can we, can we, can, can we have a turnout here?

01:41:58.480 --> 01:41:59.480
Yeah.

01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:00.480
Yeah.

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:03.480
Patience is like, Hey, remember when I held outside the front door?

01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:07.480
Can we, are we, because aren't you kind of, you may not be stealthy, but you are acrobatic,

01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:08.480
right?

01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:09.480
Is there, is there a way for you to get in?

01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:10.480
I'm not, I'm dexterous.

01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:11.480
I'm not, I'm not super acrobatic.

01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:14.480
I have a fly.

01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:15.480
That sounds promising.

01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:16.480
No.

01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:17.480
Fly to anyone.

01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:18.480
That's misleading.

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:20.480
I have a, I'm good at climbing.

01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.480
I'm a great climber.

01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.480
Great.

01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:24.480
Is there, what's the outside of this building look like?

01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:26.480
It's like rough, hewn stone bricks.

01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:27.480
Ruff, hewn.

01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:28.480
It may as well be a ladder.

01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.480
Yeah.

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.480
Exactly.

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:33.480
You made this place out of ladders.

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.480
Yeah.

01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:39.480
I, I, I won't, remember when I climbed the porcelain tower of Benithra Hall?

01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:40.480
Yeah.

01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.480
Yes, I do.

01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:42.480
Yeah.

01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:44.480
That was, it was made of porcelain.

01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:45.480
Yeah.

01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:46.480
All right.

01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:48.480
How high is the, is this wall?

01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:49.480
It's 40 feet.

01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.480
Okay.

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:51.480
I'm going to start climbing that motherfucker.

01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.480
Oh yeah.

01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:53.480
You do that.

01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:54.480
You easily make it on.

01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:55.480
Did I say 40 feet?

01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:56.480
Let's say 25 feet.

01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:57.480
Okay.

01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:02.480
You make it on to what looks like a kitchen as you can see in the windows climbing on.

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:06.480
And if you get in trouble up there, you guys just start yelling and I'll come blazing in

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:10.480
because sadly, relative to this party, I'm what the millennials call a tank.

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.480
Wait, so I made it up into a kitchen?

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:16.480
No, you're on top of a kitchen.

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:17.480
How do I know it's a kitchen?

01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:18.480
Because you saw in the windows.

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:19.480
Okay.

01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:23.480
Is there any way to tie off a rope and, and, and, and let him climb up?

01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:24.480
Yeah.

01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:25.480
There's a gargoyle.

01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:26.480
Okay.

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:27.480
I'd, I'd, I'd sweet.

01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:28.480
Yeah.

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:30.480
And those Batman games and gargoyles.

01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:31.480
Okay.

01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:32.480
That's fucking.

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:38.480
I tie off my rope and toss it down and, and, and, and say, hey, we got a kitchen up here.

01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.480
Thanks.

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:40.480
All right.

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:44.480
I'm going to come up with my climb of zero.

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:46.480
What's your deck?

01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:49.480
This is going to be great.

01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.480
Dexterity.

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.480
Go ahead.

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:52.480
Dexterity.

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:53.480
Dexterity is 12.

01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:54.480
All right.

01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:56.480
You do it.

01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.480
It's easy to climb up a rope.

01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:01.480
Tell that to me.

01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:02.480
No, I don't.

01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:04.480
It's hard.

01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:07.480
These are, these are knotted ropes meant to be climbed up easily.

01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:10.480
I'm on top of this my entire childhood.

01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:11.480
I look around.

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.480
Can I see into the inner area?

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.480
Yeah.

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:15.480
You can see the yard.

01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:16.480
Oh man.

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:17.480
You see two horses.

01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:18.480
They're like real nice.

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:19.480
Oh.

01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:20.480
Oh fuck.

01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:22.480
Wait, wait, we saw.

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:26.480
No, no, look, you're not going to believe these horses.

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:27.480
I don't know.

01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:29.480
He was, he wasn't exaggerating.

01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:30.480
Look at these things.

01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:32.480
Wait, how are we looking at the horses?

01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:34.480
I'm picturing us like we climbed up something.

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:35.480
Yeah.

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:36.480
You're on top of the kitchen.

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:37.480
Oh, because he went up the stairs.

01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:38.480
Yeah.

01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:41.980
So the buildings kind of, the buildings like a big square with a big square in the middle

01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:42.980
of it.

01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:46.480
So you're kind of on the peripheral square and you're looking into the yard and the

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.480
inside of it in the middle square.

01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:50.480
Oh, there's horses down there.

01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:51.480
Down there.

01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:52.480
Those are beautiful horses.

01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:53.480
Yeah.

01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:59.480
Also, across the yard, you can see, you can see like a, what are you, it looks like an,

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:00.480
like an abbey.

01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:01.480
I don't know.

01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:03.480
It looks like a fucking mission building, you know, those long kind of mission.

01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:08.080
And in the window, you can see Steve opens the door and he's like, he's, he's walking

01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:10.840
into one of these bedrooms and you can kind of see him.

01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:12.480
You don't, you don't really see too well.

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:13.480
You just see him over there.

01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:14.480
Okay.

01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:16.480
He's walking one of the doors.

01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:17.480
Let's go.

01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:20.480
Can we, can we walk around on the rooftops all the way around this to where he is?

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:25.480
Yeah, but it'll end, you'll end up on top of his roof, on top of the roof that he's

01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:26.480
under.

01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:28.480
So you'll be on top of him.

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:30.480
But is there access through that roof?

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:32.480
Like to that staircase or anything like that?

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.480
Could we get to the staircase?

01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:36.480
You'd have to climb back down on the inside of the yard kind of.

01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:37.480
Okay.

01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:38.480
Right.

01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:39.480
Well, he saw the horses and walked past the horses.

01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:41.480
I said, we just, we just get in there and everyone's asleep.

01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:42.480
Let's be quiet.

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.480
Or do you want to go rooftop?

01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:46.480
Wait, I'm, I'm sorry.

01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:50.480
We're kind of like walking the guard wall around a courtyard, right?

01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:51.480
Right.

01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:52.480
And within the courtyard, there's an abbey.

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:53.480
Yeah.

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.480
And the abbey is now we're leaving.

01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:57.480
Well, no, actually the buildings are like the courtyard.

01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:02.480
They, like, or the buildings form the guard wall, like all these buildings form a perimeter,

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:03.480
but the buildings themselves.

01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:04.480
Yeah.

01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:06.480
So why don't we just go to the roof of the building that we saw diarrhea.

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:07.480
Okay.

01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:08.480
All right.

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:12.480
And well, I'm waking, it seems to me like at least all the video games I play, that's

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.480
the, you know, may as well do that.

01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:15.480
Okay.

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:16.480
I keep my rope.

01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:17.480
Okay.

01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:18.480
You get it.

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:19.480
Okay.

01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:21.480
You think, you think it's quieter to walk on people's roofs while they're sleeping or

01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:23.480
just to tiptoe across the courtyard?

01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:24.480
No, I do not.

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:25.480
No.

01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:27.480
When you put it to me that way, I do not think that way.

01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:28.480
All right.

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.480
I, I keep my rope tied to the gargoyle and leave it there in case we need to get out that

01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:33.480
way.

01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:34.480
I'm going to leave that rope there.

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.480
Are you, are you going to climb down into the courtyard now?

01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:38.480
Okay.

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:39.480
We'll get down in the courtyard.

01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:40.480
Yeah.

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:41.480
We'll pass the horses into the abbey.

01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:42.480
Yeah.

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:44.480
But my rope's going to have to stay there because there's no one to get the rope off.

01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:45.480
Okay.

01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:46.480
Right?

01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:47.480
Yeah.

01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:48.480
Okay.

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:49.480
Yeah.

01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:50.480
It's a good, it's a good rope to have.

01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:51.480
Okay.

01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:52.480
Yeah.

01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:53.480
All right.

01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:54.480
There.

01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.480
Okay.

01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:56.480
So we, we climbed down.

01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:57.480
Oh yeah.

01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.480
Wait.

01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.480
You climbed down the rope.

01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:00.480
Yes.

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.480
Yes.

01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:02.480
Got it.

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:03.480
Okay.

01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:04.480
You're in the courtyard.

01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:05.480
Horses, like storage equipment, staircase, one door.

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:06.480
Okay.

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:07.480
We go up that staircase.

01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:08.480
Steve's hall.

01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:09.480
You see the door.

01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:10.480
It's still open.

01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:11.480
You see Steve.

01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:12.480
He's looking at you.

01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:13.480
Hey.

01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:14.480
Hey.

01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:16.480
We need the horses.

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:18.480
We don't need horses.

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:19.480
I just.

01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:20.480
Yeah.

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:22.480
This is the problem with your generation.

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:23.480
I want it.

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:24.480
It's conspicuous consumption.

01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.480
You don't need those horses.

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:27.480
You only just saw that.

01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:28.480
They're so beautiful.

01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:30.480
It could hold all of my armor and swords.

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:33.480
I have, I have a perfect horse for you.

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:38.480
It's called two legs and, and, and self-reliance.

01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.480
Okay.

01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.480
Look, I'll make you a deal.

01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:43.480
Okay.

01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:50.480
If the shit, it's the medieval equivalent of a fan.

01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:51.480
Yeah.

01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:53.480
Just a different fan.

01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:55.480
A front.

01:47:55.480 --> 01:48:01.480
We, of course, when we leave, we'll take the horses.

01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:03.480
It's a perfect escape vehicle.

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.480
Great.

01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:05.480
Yeah.

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.480
But we're not, right now, we need to focus.

01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:08.480
Okay.

01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:10.480
I go over and, can I see the face of the sleeping person in this room?

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:11.480
What?

01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:12.480
Sure.

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:13.480
Yeah.

01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:14.480
You don't have stealth, right?

01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:18.480
I look, I look, I try to go get a look at this person and see if it's anyone we've met before.

01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:21.480
Like possibly the, the, the prior.

01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:25.480
It's, it's a person you saw at the church, but it's not someone you're introduced to.

01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:26.480
It's no one very important.

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:27.480
We saw at the church?

01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:28.480
Oh yeah.

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:29.480
It was the first time we were there.

01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:30.480
Yeah.

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:31.480
You first went to the church and met a couple of people.

01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:34.480
I just want to examine his feet.

01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:36.480
See if there's like, or is he undercover?

01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:37.480
Yeah.

01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:38.480
He's in the bed.

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:39.480
So you'd have to manipulate.

01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:40.480
Okay.

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:43.480
Should we open the, I want to, I want to talk to you guys.

01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:45.480
Like I want to share my thoughts about this.

01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:46.480
What we're doing here.

01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:47.480
Okay.

01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:48.480
Let's go in the hallway.

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:49.480
Hey guys.

01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:50.480
What's up?

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:51.480
Let's be patch-ins.

01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:52.480
What?

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:53.480
Shut the fuck up.

01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:54.480
Shut the fuck up.

01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:55.480
Don't ever, ever.

01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:56.480
Tell us.

01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:57.480
Okay.

01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:03.480
I would, I would, I would, I would have a fucking sidebar, sidebar in the courtyard.

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:04.480
Okay.

01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:05.480
Emergency courtyard.

01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:08.480
It's like a shit, shit my tunic.

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:09.480
Okay.

01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:10.480
Fucking patches.

01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.480
All right.

01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:15.480
Did we go somewhere where we're out of ear shot?

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:16.480
We feel a little.

01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:17.480
Okay.

01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:18.480
Still lowering my voice.

01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:20.480
I just want to say, this is, I want to, let's all share our thoughts.

01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:21.480
Okay.

01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:23.480
We haven't communicated since we started infiltrating an abbey.

01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:24.480
Okay.

01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:25.480
We should open all the chests.

01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:26.480
This is my, no.

01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:27.480
Like that.

01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:28.480
You can, you can say that.

01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:32.480
You have a right to say that when I've like, like that's not a thought that I'm rejecting

01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:33.480
or brainstorming.

01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:36.480
But I want to, I want to, I want to say what I have to say.

01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:37.480
I'm still a student.

01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:40.020
We followed a robed figure.

01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:41.600
We think that they're here.

01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:45.480
If they're here, I'm going to throw out some thoughts.

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:46.480
Vampire.

01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:47.480
Done.

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:50.480
Ghoul master.

01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:51.480
Ghost.

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:52.480
Ghost.

01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:54.480
Mega ghost.

01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:57.240
Here's my point.

01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:05.160
Someone here goes out at night, mutilates cattle, comes back here at, at dawn break.

01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:09.680
They're going to sleep in a, not just hang out in a bed.

01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:13.080
There's going to be, there's going to be, why, why do you think they hate the cattle?

01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:17.680
They're, they want blood or, for the, for the, they also, they also killed children.

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:18.680
For the ceremony.

01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:19.680
The ceremony is coming up.

01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:20.680
The, when the patch is stuck.

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:21.680
Oh yeah.

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:22.680
We need it.

01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:26.520
There's evil afoot in a, in this place, and that means that there's probably an evil

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:31.560
section where the evil is more afoot than in plain sight.

01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:36.520
We need to be looking for subterranean egress.

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.840
I hate to overuse that word.

01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:39.840
Okay.

01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:40.840
Patches.

01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:44.440
Do you know where the, where the prior sleeps, where, where is his room?

01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.440
Oh yeah.

01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:46.960
Is it one of these six doors here?

01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:47.960
No, no.

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:48.960
It's elsewhere.

01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:49.960
Is it subterranean?

01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:50.960
No.

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:53.640
It's a, it's a, it's in the library.

01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:55.920
Why do they call you patches?

01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:57.480
Huh?

01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:58.480
My parents?

01:50:58.480 --> 01:50:59.480
Why?

01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:00.480
Patchens.

01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:01.480
Patchens?

01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:02.480
What?

01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:03.480
Yeah.

01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:04.480
P-A-T-C-H-E-N-S.

01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:09.480
How come you didn't correct us?

01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:10.480
Is this your last name?

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:11.480
What?

01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:12.480
Is this your last name?

01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:13.480
No.

01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:14.480
It's my first name.

01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:15.480
Patchens.

01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:18.080
Who do, who do those nice, nice horses downstairs belong to?

01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:19.080
What?

01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:20.840
Does it really nice horses down in the courtyard?

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.480
No church peoples has hortens.

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.480
I just want to leave.

01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:24.480
That would be so funny.

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:25.480
No, no.

01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:26.480
Don't go patchens.

01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:27.480
Don't go.

01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:28.480
What's your last name?

01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:31.480
Stubens.

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:32.480
Stubens?

01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:33.480
No.

01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:34.480
Stubens.

01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:35.480
Stupens?

01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:36.480
Yeah.

01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:37.480
Stupens.

01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:38.480
Patchens?

01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:39.480
Stupens?

01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:40.480
Yeah.

01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:45.480
What nationality is that?

01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:48.480
It's, uh, uh, it's Thrainin.

01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:49.480
Thrainin.

01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:50.480
Oh, I know Thrainin.

01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:51.480
That should have guessed.

01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:58.480
Patchens Stupens.

01:51:58.480 --> 01:51:59.480
That's great.

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:00.480
Okay.

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:01.480
Thank you.

01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:02.480
Sorry.

01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:03.480
I hope that didn't abrade you.

01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:04.480
No, no.

01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:05.480
It's great.

01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:08.480
I just want to just get an accurate quote of something you just said because it sounds

01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:11.480
like it might be a good episode title.

01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:12.480
No, no, no.

01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:15.480
Church people got no hortes.

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:16.480
Is that close?

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:17.480
It's close.

01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:22.480
Oh, that's actually a clue.

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:25.480
It's like there's, uh, to metagame for a second.

01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:28.480
That's like we saw Ferraris in the parking lot with licensees.

01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:29.480
Oh, shit.

01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:30.480
You're right.

01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:31.480
It's a cold clue.

01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:32.480
That's a fucking clue.

01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:34.480
Those horses are too fancy.

01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:36.480
We got to find Patchens.

01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:37.480
Hey.

01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:38.480
Stupens.

01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:41.480
What's up?

01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:43.480
Where are the guest quarters?

01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:44.480
Uh, nice.

01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:45.480
They're here.

01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:47.480
These are the guest quarters.

01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:48.480
Guests sleep up here.

01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:50.480
Is this guy in the room that we were just in?

01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:51.480
Is that one of the guests?

01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:52.480
No, no.

01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:53.480
Do you know where they're sleeping?

01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:55.480
I don't, I don't think we have any guests.

01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.480
How nice are their chests?

01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:58.480
Not that kind of chest.

01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:01.480
The one you could open and there's toys inside.

01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:07.480
Uh, it would be in the, there's no, I don't think there's any guests here.

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:10.480
You just think he doesn't think there's any guests.

01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:11.480
Secret guests.

01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:12.480
Secret guests.

01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:13.480
What we're hearing.

01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:14.480
Where is the library?

01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:17.480
It's, uh, it's, uh, the opposite.

01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:18.480
It's behind us.

01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:19.480
It's the opposite way.

01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:20.480
We have to split up.

01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:26.480
One of us has to go up to the head, uh, prior, prior turds, uh, bedroom.

01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:27.480
Yeah.

01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:31.480
And make sure he doesn't have signs of dew moisture on his feet.

01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:32.480
Right.

01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:36.480
I'll go to the library for some reason.

01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:40.480
No, because the library is where the, where the priors, his, his bedrooms in, or it's

01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:41.480
near the library.

01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:42.480
It's in the library.

01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:45.480
Is there, is there an underground, like kind of like, like a, like a dungeony kind of,

01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:47.480
like keep or hold here?

01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:48.480
Hmm.

01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:49.480
Yeah.

01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:50.480
That's a yes.

01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:52.480
No, not that I know of.

01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:53.480
Can I go?

01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:54.480
I'm new here.

01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:57.480
Is it possible for me to get inside the church temple proper?

01:53:57.480 --> 01:53:58.480
Yeah.

01:53:58.480 --> 01:53:59.480
Yeah.

01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:02.480
That other door from the yard is maybe the best option.

01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:03.480
Where's that event happening?

01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:04.480
The ceremony?

01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:05.480
The ceremony.

01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:06.480
I don't know.

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:08.480
Probably somewhere in the church that they boarded up.

01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:09.480
I'll go in there.

01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:10.480
Like in the non-existent cellar.

01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:11.480
We should have lit that door on fire.

01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:13.480
Why do you want us to split up right now?

01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:16.480
Because we've thrown out like nine places to go.

01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:19.480
And I, I think somebody should go down.

01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:23.480
I'm not going to say who I think it should be, but someone should go examine those horses

01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:27.480
and see if there's any like identifying like, you know, like saddlebag stuff.

01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:28.480
I'll do it.

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:31.480
Let me examine those horses.

01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:33.480
And you're going to check on the prioritor?

01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:34.480
The church.

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:36.480
You're going to go to the library and check out on the.

01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:37.480
Oh, okay.

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:39.480
You want to, you take the church.

01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:40.480
Wait.

01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:41.480
The church is the church.

01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:42.480
Right.

01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:45.480
The library is a different place and that's where the prior sleeps.

01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:49.480
If you're stealthier, you should, the sleeping prior, you should go check on him.

01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:50.480
I'll take sleeping prior.

01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:51.480
Yeah.

01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:52.480
See if there's any signs that he's been out and about.

01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:53.480
Yeah.

01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:54.480
If he's there.

01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:55.480
If he's not there.

01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:56.480
Jackpot.

01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:57.480
Okay.

01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:58.480
Meat.

01:54:58.480 --> 01:54:59.480
Let's all meat.

01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:00.480
Let's meet back at the church.

01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:01.480
Let's meet back at my rope.

01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:02.480
At your rope.

01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:04.480
Let's meet back at your rope in.

01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:06.480
Why did you look at your wrist?

01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:09.480
Why did you stop and look at your wrist?

01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:14.480
Have you guys seen Hudson Hawk?

01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:15.480
Do you know any show tunes?

01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:16.480
Yes.

01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:17.480
We can sing while we check.

01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:18.480
All right.

01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:19.480
All right.

01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:20.480
No, never mind.

01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:21.480
All right.

01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:22.480
Let's meet back.

01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:25.480
How did people keep time?

01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:28.480
When the moon.

01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:29.480
When the moon.

01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:33.480
The moon is descending over this part of the sky.

01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:35.480
Before the moon touches the top of that tree.

01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:37.480
When standing in the middle of the courtyard.

01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:40.480
In the middle of the courtyard.

01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:43.480
Well, let's just meet in the middle of the courtyard.

01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:44.480
Okay.

01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:45.480
Okay.

01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:48.480
In about five minutey things.

01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:49.480
Yeah.

01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:50.480
All right.

01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:51.480
Okay, guys.

01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:54.480
Put your hands in the middle because we can't do all this stuff.

01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:58.480
We have to make it a dramatic thing like a serialized Netflix show.

01:55:58.480 --> 01:55:59.480
We have to turn an ending.

01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:04.480
You have to make an ending out of what is otherwise just an 800 minute movie.

01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:05.480
Okay.

01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:07.480
You're the elder of our group.

01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:12.480
Do you want to say a little prayer to the church of the flame, the silver flame?

01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:16.480
Guys, I believe in our religion.

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:19.480
I don't believe in our church.

01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:20.480
I said it.

01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:24.480
You found it out now.

01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:31.480
We're in a fucking mission from the silver flame.

01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:33.480
You believe in the silver flame though?

01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:34.480
Fuck yes.

01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:35.480
Yes.

01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:38.480
That's why I don't like the church of the silver flame.

01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:44.480
Dude, this is not the best time to be laying this honest, man.

01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:45.480
You guys both learned from me.

01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:47.480
I saw a promise in you.

01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:49.480
I actually fudged some of the memos.

01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:55.480
They sent me here on a suicide mission and I said, I want my two boys with me.

01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:56.480
Wait.

01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:57.480
With my right hand?

01:56:57.480 --> 01:56:58.480
Jackpot.

01:56:58.480 --> 01:56:59.480
See you in five.

01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:00.480
What?

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:07.480
Cliffing it.

01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:09.480
Thank you so much, everybody.

01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:12.480
Thank you for coming.

01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:16.480
Steve Levy.

01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:22.480
Matthew Mcconnelly from the Armed Forces, Special Forces.

01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:26.480
Let's hear for our guest, Jamali Maddox, everybody.

01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:30.480
Check out his show, Hate Thy Neighbor on Vice.

01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:32.480
Spencer Crittenden.

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:36.480
Thanks to everyone here at Starburns.

01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:42.480
Thank you to Church, Kevin Day, Sarah Hills, Zach McHeaver, Kris Boruff.

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:45.480
Everybody here doing all the things and forgetting lots of people.

01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:46.480
Thank you all for coming out again.

01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:48.480
I'm Jeff Davis, your comptroller.

01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:50.480
Your mayor is Dan Harmon.

01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:51.480
There you go.

01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:53.480
See ya.

01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:57.480
There was the guy from West Virginia that tweeted he came for a rap.

01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:00.480
Hip hop, West Virginia rap.

01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:02.480
Hip hop, West Virginia rap.

01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:03.480
Rap, rap, rap.

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:04.480
Rap, rap.

01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:06.480
Gonna rap you like this Virginia rap.

01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:07.480
Zach, put a beat on.

01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:15.480
I'm gonna leave the stage.

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:20.480
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:23.480
The Virginias are divided.

01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:26.480
They're on different side bits.

01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:28.480
West Virginia feels like this.

01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:32.480
East Virginia said, just call me this, Virginia.

01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:34.480
I don't want to be East Virginia.

01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:36.480
I just want to be Virginia.

01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:38.480
West Virginia's like, fuck you then.

01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:40.480
Gonna go over to the West End.

01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:45.480
And then one guy from West Virginia came to the show to hear me rap about it.

01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:47.480
Lame, Lee.

01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:51.480
So I did, so I'm a man of my word and a man of my bib.

01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:53.480
Because when I eat, I eat like a baby.

01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:55.480
I eat your mama's pussy.

01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:56.480
I don't say maybe.

01:58:56.480 --> 01:58:57.480
Not unbeat.

01:58:57.480 --> 01:58:59.480
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:10.480
I fucked your mama so hard, I started spewing verbally about her experience as a woman.

01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:16.480
It's called mansplaining and it's the hot new move.

01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:18.480
A mansplain to your mama.

01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:19.480
A mansplain to your daughter.

01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:22.480
A mansplain to the mountains about the meaning of water.

01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:27.480
I said, a waterfall goes down because it hates to affect your mama like she was Kathy Bates.

01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:32.480
And I said, body positive.

01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:35.480
I fucked your mama, explained it to her.

01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:40.480
And she said, well, now that you said it that way, I get it.

01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:41.480
And I left.

01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:43.480
And I explained some more.

01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:46.480
And we'll explain more next week. We're doing the show Saturday next week too.

01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:48.480
Thank you guys. Bye.

02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:05.480
Did you get any of that?

02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:12.480
It's a good show.
