{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:16.000\nI'm Gloria's Uptown Burbank. Once again, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:39.000\nIt's so good to be back. We missed you guys. You know who I missed the most? The Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:46.000\nI never stop missing the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:52.000\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. What a crowd. What a crowd.\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:53.000\nYeah.\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:59.000\nSo there's too many variables for us to track. We now don't know, is Saturday night a better night?\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:11.000\nHave we been slowly, because my liberal views have slowly seeped out and have they alienated one Nazi that's been replaced by five Democrats?\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:17.000\nOr are Bernie Crats just more patient, or do they have less to do on Saturdays?\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:25.000\nI don't know. We took off a bunch of weeks off. Should we just do the show once a month and then have a heightened interest?\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:31.000\nSteve Levy with Ice, everybody. Steve Levy.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:39.000\nFlattered by your numbers and your applause. Thank you. Was that a sneeze or Italian blood?\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:41.000\nHe said frost. He said what?\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:43.000\nHe said frost. Frosty.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:44.000\nFrosty?\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:46.000\nFrosty? I hope not.\n\n01:46.000 --> 02:00.000\nCould be Tourette's. We don't know. You can't make fun of people anymore. We got an internet now. No matter how silly someone is, you can find out how they feel.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:10.000\nIt just ruins everything. If Octomom happened tomorrow, there would be a Tumblr blog from her the next day where she's just like, here's how it feels to be Octomom.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:27.000\nAnd we'd be like, fuck me. Yeah, be an Octomom. Everything. We're an admirer of information. We're not learning anything. We're not getting smarter.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:35.000\nWe're getting scared. We're chimpanzees and we just have alarm signals. We talked about that in our pockets.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:49.000\nAnd also listed things to talk about in our pockets too. I was watching Intervention again. This note could be from anywhere in the last ten years.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:56.000\nAnd someone used the phrase short end of the stick and Cody, my girlfriend, brought up an interesting point. I've never really examined that phrase.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:07.000\nShe's like, what's with this short end of the stick? Just pull the stick. You get a whole stick. Why is this short end of the stick? How can you have a short end of a stick?\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:17.000\nIt doesn't even make sense. Maybe it's like drawing straws or maybe you have to grab it and whoever grabs it has less stick. That's the person that's chosen.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:21.000\nA stick has two ends and neither are shorter than the other. For sure.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:26.000\nBut if two people are grabbing it at the same time, maybe one end is sticking out.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:30.000\nYou're referring to that crazy baseball bat game with the hands.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:32.000\nThat's a total guess. That's probably wrong.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:42.000\nLet's just think about this, you guys. If you were to grab a stick, which end would you grab? The short end or the tall end?\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:44.000\nThere is no...\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:53.000\nYeah, no, the tall end. You would grab the tall end. If you're a baseball player, you want the short end because you need more bats to be able to hit the ball.\n\n03:53.000 --> 04:02.000\nHow do you know when you're grabbing? How do you grab the tall end by putting your hand lower or higher?\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:06.000\nYou've got to grab the tall end.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:19.000\nI can understand because we have wishbones in our culture, but that's like a slingshot and you pull and there's a way to get the short end.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:34.000\nAlso, short end of the stick, it always means... there's not luck involved usually. Short end of the stick is more like, oh yeah, we decided to do a designated driver program and then my turn came up on prom night.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:41.000\nI kind of got the short end of the stick there. It wasn't like a luck of the draw as much as it was. I got fucked by the system.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:50.000\nShort end of the stick. I agree with Cody. Don't be such a cynic. Just grab the stick. You've got a whole stick.\n\n04:50.000 --> 05:00.000\nNow you won the stick contest. You've got a whole stick, whatever that's where. You're imprisoned in a matrix where you're valuing the ends of sticks and someone's laughing at you.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:07.000\nBig stick is laughing at you. Long stick is laughing at you.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:14.000\nBoy, this new note taking app. It just says leaks. That's all it says.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:18.000\nIt looks like it used to be the worst end of the staff.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:21.000\nAnd then it got changed to the short end of the stick.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:29.000\nI was just reading about it. There's the wrong end of the stick, the wrong end of the staff. It's a medieval origin thing.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:33.000\nSo to be on the wrong end of the staff, the short end, I don't know.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:38.000\nAgain, I would want to be on the short end because there's less stick to get hit with.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:44.000\nIf somebody's waving you this much stick, I can whack him that much. See what I'm talking about?\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:51.000\nI want to be on the shorter end of my stick. I want you on the wrong end of my stick.\n\n05:51.000 --> 06:01.000\nYou're saying that if someone's holding a stick, then if the long end is pointing at you, then you're getting stabbed.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:07.000\nIf the short end is pointing at you, they're committing Harry Carey in front of you.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:14.000\nBut the expression means to get the shit end of a bargain or to get something wrong.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nIt's inverted in that.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:20.000\nThat's why I would have been the first to die in the medieval times.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nYou know what always hangs me up is the business end of things.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:28.000\nOh, I'm at the business end of a revolver. I'm not sure. I've got to remember what you mean by that.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:31.000\nI don't know. Are you holding the revolver or are you about to get shot?\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nThe business is where the bullet comes out.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:39.000\nAre you the customer of a revolver if you're getting shot? I don't know. You pay no money.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nYou go cruising for cruising.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:45.000\nYou are stimulating the marketplace by being a dead person.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:51.000\nThis is like, oh, I want more of those. You're in the market for getting shot.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:54.000\nYou're entering the market, baby.\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:58.000\nI was watching Intervention and there was a woman today. Here's the thing about Intervention.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:03.000\nI watch it relentlessly. Of course, there's the joke. I'm addicted to Intervention.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:09.000\nBut here's my confession about Intervention as I think I've confessed before.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:13.000\nIt's truly a guilty pleasure beyond, like, let's watch Gremlins 2, Guilty Pleasure.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:22.000\nThis is truly a guilty pleasure because I watch Intervention with Cody and we absolutely pick and choose who deserves recovery.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:28.000\nBased on what they did to earn their addiction.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:33.000\nIf you got molested, pass. You're done. You're fine.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:39.000\nI don't care how much of a prick you are to your parents at 35 and how much coke you need to keep doing.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:44.000\nIf there's some story from your past where you went camping and someone was like, let me show you how to fish.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:50.000\nThey meant something else. You can do as much coke as you want and you can throw chairs at Jeff Van Vondren.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:55.000\nI don't care. You're cool. I root for you. I hope you recover.\n\n07:55.000 --> 08:01.000\nThere was this Indian guy. He was adopted by this beautiful white Christian family.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:05.000\nThey looked like a crazy 80's Christmas card, this family.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:12.000\nAlso, as an extension of their Christianity, they adopted this kid from India who was two years old when he came over.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:19.000\nHe probably only had the vaguest unconscious memories of, like, he was found in a pool of diarrhea or something.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:26.000\nThey were a dire rescuing human from a part of the earth where the parents weren't in surplus.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:35.000\nThen he grew up as part of this Christian family. They thought, oh, you're so brown, but we love you.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:39.000\nThey were doing it wrong. They were like, you look just like us to us.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:44.000\nIt's just sort of war on them. Then he was like, I don't know. I kind of feel better when I do heroin.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:47.000\nThey were like, yeah, but Jesus would be even better than that heroin.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:51.000\nHe had my permission to be all fucked up.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:58.000\nBut then Candy Finnegan comes in through the skylight. She's like, I was adopted. If you're adopted, Candy Finnegan will sort your shit out, man.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:07.000\nSorry, anyways. I was at intervention. There was a woman. It said she's been addicted to crack for 30 years.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:18.000\nI mean, mission accomplished. Did she invent crack? She must have smoked the first crack, and she's doing fine.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:21.000\nShe knows exactly how much to not do.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:28.000\nYeah, she's like Mr. Robot with the morphine. Is he Mr. Robot? Don't tell me.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:33.000\nWhat? The pool of diarrhea?\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:39.000\nI'm not trying to be like, what? I'm saying they adopted this kid.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nThat's so much diarrhea.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:48.000\nWell, you saw a slim dog millionaire, right? No, no.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:55.000\nThere's a pool of diarrhea scene. It just, it sounds like it costs money to make a pool of diarrhea.\n\n09:55.000 --> 10:01.000\nThat's not something that happens from lack of upkeep that takes work and money.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:04.000\nWhat else is in here?\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:07.000\nWhat if you were the pool guy? That's the worst job.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:14.000\nYou're checking the levels. Yeah, it's diarrhea. You're picturing like a pool swimming pool of diarrhea.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:18.000\nWhy are you paying me to get leaves out of a pool of diarrhea?\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:26.000\nAnd why did it have to be Olympic size? This is why the Olympics don't come here.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nI think the Olympics come into LA in 2020.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:38.000\nOh my God, I'm so mad about that. I hate the Olympics, you guys, and fuck everybody and fuck America.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:47.000\nWe should do the show on Saturdays. We got Feisty Spencer, we got a packed house.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:51.000\nI know. That's one of the few things I could talk about. I don't like the Olympics.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nBecause the Olympics come to town and they...\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:58.000\nI don't like the IOC. They're bad people. They come in and they're like...\n\n10:58.000 --> 10:59.000\nThe International Olympic Commission?\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:05.000\nYeah, they're like, give us all the money because we're the Olympics. They're like a mafia.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:11.000\nThey just come around and they're like, it would be a shame if the Olympics weren't allowed to happen in your city.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:17.000\nMaybe you build a couple of stadiums.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:23.000\nYeah, because every 10-day Olympics comes to town when they went to London, when they went to Rio.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:27.000\nThe people all go broke. The traffic sucks. You're late for work. Your life is miserable.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:34.000\nAnd a bunch of people that run contracting for like the soccer stadiums and for all the infrastructure,\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:38.000\nthey all get rich, but it's all kickbacks. It's all their crony friends and stuff like that.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:43.000\nAnd the IOC is suing all the while. They're just sending out lawsuits.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:50.000\nThe gold medal burger? Fuck you. Pay us money. You got the Olympics special because we're in your town\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:55.000\nand everyone Olympics is in your town. Pay us money because you can't use the rings.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nLike, you know, they're bad people.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:01.000\nThey told, and our guest tonight probably maybe knows better about this.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:06.000\nThey told people in London, they're like, yeah, the commute times are going to be longer,\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:09.000\nso just get up early. Go to work early.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:13.000\nThat was their solve for that was like, don't complain about the travel time. Just work longer.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:17.000\nWasn't there a bus driver's strike around then too? Who cares?\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:22.000\nAnd it's all under the umbrella, obviously, just as everything in Hollywood is kind of under the umbrella\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:29.000\nof like, oh, you're a PA and you don't like being awake for 16 hours and changing my cat's box.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.000\nLike, what, you hate Marilyn Monroe or something?\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:36.000\nYou know, it's like, we get away with a lot of abuse in Hollywood because it's Hollywood\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:41.000\nand everyone wants to be in it. So the Olympics got to be like, oh, your city doesn't want\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:50.000\nthe single global, I'm trying to riff the, you know, the Olympics are cool.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:57.000\nThe Olympics represent international harmony, so you can't say I don't want the Olympics here.\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:01.000\nRight, but I wonder how it breaks down. Well, let's talk to a Londoner.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:09.000\nThis guy's also an amazing standup that I just met on Thursday and then I kept running into him.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:14.000\nI'm like, come on, come on the show, man. He's got this documentary series that you can tell from.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:18.000\nI can tell from the trailer is really good, but haven't actually seen it. It's on Vice Land.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:22.000\nIt's called Hate Thy Neighbor, but you can absolutely tell it's awesome.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:39.000\nPlease welcome Jamali Maddox.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:43.000\nCan you talk like a chimney sweep?\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:48.000\nNo. That's the thing is like, people think we actually talk like that.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:52.000\nBut me saying it right now, I think that I probably do sound like a chimney sweep.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nTo us, you do. To us.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nI'm like saying it like, we don't all talk like chimney sweeps.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\nThe label's like, you sound like a chimney sweep, right?\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:03.000\nYou sound more like a chimney sweep than us doing our best impression of a chimney sweep.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:07.000\nRight, but then Jewish as well is, I know coming here, I didn't realize that people get surprised\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nof this accent coming out of this face.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:10.000\nRight.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:17.000\nLike people expect like a guy riding a horse and I come along and go, hey, you know, brown-skinned dude.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:21.000\nYou think we expect you to be riding a horse without actually?\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:26.000\nI thought people would send me to be white, but they want to jump in there too quickly.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:32.000\nI mean, the whitest thing in the world would be just to be coming down the street on a horse.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nThat's how white people are living nowadays, man.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nThat's the Trump dream.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nWe're going to be back right now.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:40.000\nWho get horses?\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:41.000\nA horse on every stable.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nThat's what's making America great.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nLet's go back to that day in time where everybody rode horses.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nThat's what make America great means.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:53.000\nIf you could just have enough technology to breed horses that ate coal, we would be very happy.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nThat would be our dream.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:59.000\nSo you could have a literally a 10-horse powered horse.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:03.000\nAnd then everyone could just like, yeah, and there would just be waiting and shit outside.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:08.000\nLike the shit would like, there would be like a holiday where all the poor people cleaned up the shit\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nand played frisbee with it.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nPlaying frisbee with the shit.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:16.000\nTo what extent?\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\nWait, why did that get a laugh?\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nDid I ignore a question or did I?\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nYou just very nonchalantly glossed over.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nHe said, why play frisbee with the shit?\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nYou said, why?\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nOkay, that's why.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:29.000\nI recognize that laugh as Dan ignored a question.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:33.000\nI said, why frisbee as opposed to what?\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nThen a plastic frisbee.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.000\nI don't know why.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:40.000\nThis isn't going to hold up to a lot of questions, but...\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:48.000\nI was imagining that like, I guess I have an ancestry from Oklahoma.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:53.000\nAnd there's like a lot of jokes about like buffalo chips.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:57.000\nI don't know, like there's like disc shaped like manure.\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:00.000\nAnd I think there's like people that like throw it in contests.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:03.000\nMaybe that was in my iCloud.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:12.000\nBut I was just generally kind of like imagining like, how would corporate America turn cleaning up shit into a sport or a fun activity?\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:16.000\nIt's a great activity next to your pool of diarrhea.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:19.000\nIt's extreme shit.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nHow would you sponsor it?\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:34.000\nWell, we're on questions because I'm a big fan of linguistics.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:42.000\nTo most of us that aren't that cosmopolitan, I think maybe those of us that listen to NPR are like at a level of American that has the sense that,\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:52.000\nokay, John Oliver's accent is its lower class in its origins than like say the two other British people that I worked with on Community.\n\n16:52.000 --> 17:00.000\nLike Tristram Shapiro was a director and he sounded more like James Bond than John Oliver.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:04.000\nJohn Oliver would tell you he's from some part of London or something like.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:07.000\nReally? I kind of thought John Oliver was a posh dude for it.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:08.000\nReally?\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:13.000\nYou know, I think over here people, so you can tell the cross difference in voices.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:14.000\nNo, we can't.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:19.000\nYou know what we have because we were discussing this the other day.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:27.000\nAmerican hegemony dictates that you're forced to know what an Alabama Walmart is and I don't know what a, we're just sure Wayne's cutting is.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nTo the point where I made it up.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nThat's where somebody poops in your chair.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:38.000\nBut we would tend to maybe like there's people with southern accents.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:42.000\nWe have a whole culture thing here that's where you associate certain accents with stuff.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:46.000\nBut why am I explaining this?\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nI know the least about it.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:57.000\nBut the UK is like this compressed area and you go there and even within the boundaries of London it's so confusing to Americans.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:04.000\nI think because we, our history is 200 years long and was defined by everyone going, I don't like this.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:07.000\nI'm leaving and like everyone just spread out.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:12.000\nYou have to go, you have to grow up a million miles from someone to sound different from them in America.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:22.000\nAnd in the UK which predates cars and predates like the land of milk and honey where you just fucking split when you don't like a vibe.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:33.000\nLike you walk one block from the Queen's English with the epicenter of it and as, I'm about to steal somebody's stand up.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:34.000\nIt was Rick.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nRick Overton.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nRick Overton.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:40.000\nYeah, I had the joke about going to London and being like, I'm a blot, you can see the palace from here.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:43.000\nHow does the bread go this bad this close to the bakery?\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:47.000\nBecause, because people are talking ugly.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:51.000\nSo where are you from?\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:52.000\nAre you?\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:53.000\nI'm sorry, go ahead.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:54.000\nNo, no, no, please, please, please.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nNo, no, go ahead.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:56.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:57.000\nSee, that's British right there.\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:01.000\nIt's like the way that I apologize to him and then he apologized back.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:02.000\nI was like, but no, no, please.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:03.000\nRight.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nBut yeah, no, I'm from, I'm from the East of London.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nSo I'm from East London.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nSo that's like working class area back job.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:09.000\nRight.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:10.000\nYeah.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:16.000\nSo like, and when, God damn it, fucking Borat, God damn it.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:17.000\nSasha Baron Cohen.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:22.000\nYes, when Sasha is doing Ali G, was he doing East London?\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:23.000\nOkay.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:24.000\nOkay.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:25.000\nNo.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:33.000\nThat's not like, that is a, that I'm trying to be so polite because I know it's been\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:34.000\nlive stream.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:35.000\nAre you talking about chavs?\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nNo.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:37.000\nSorry.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:41.000\nThat's like this weird thing now where it's like, like they call them chavs.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:44.000\nChav is just a way to, to insult working class.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:45.000\nRight.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nI don't think Ali G did.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nI think Ali G was satirizing people doing that.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:53.000\nBut if there was this big influx where there's this new black face of people coming up to\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nme going like, what's going on, brother?\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nBloods.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nAnd it's this whole thing of like, and it's like, I'd rather just call me the N-word and\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:00.000\nlet me get on with my day.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:01.000\nDo you know what I'm saying?\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:04.000\nIt's this, this constant thing of just justified bullshit.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:09.000\nYou know, and it's like, so that that accent isn't, isn't no one's accent.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:10.000\nNo one actually.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:11.000\nOh, well, okay.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:12.000\nYeah.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:18.000\nBut, but is that to say that he's doing a very cartoonish version of an accent that does\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nexist and that you can pinpoint?\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.000\nYeah, okay.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:24.000\nBut it's more of a cultural thing, like kind of a hip hop beat kind of.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:25.000\nYeah.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:26.000\nIt's the UK version.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:27.000\nYeah.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:31.000\nBut that, but that particular accent, like no one is like, that's so cartoony that no one\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nactually speaks like that.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nRight.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:34.000\nAnd it's actually borderline.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nMaybe I don't want to use the word offensive, but whatever.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:37.000\nNo, I never found it offensive.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:38.000\nI didn't find the offensive craft.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:39.000\nI saw what he was doing.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:42.000\nI saw a person that he was taking the piss out of people that would do that.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:45.000\nBut at the same time, like people would mimic that.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:49.000\nThat's a good segue to what you're currently doing for a living because it seems to me like\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:55.000\nthe word offensive probably has a lot more callous around it for you because you're right\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:59.000\nnow drawing a paycheck going around talking to Nazis and stuff.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:00.000\nYeah.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:03.000\nLike your show is hate thy neighbor, which I haven't seen yet, but I can't wait to.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:05.000\nBut because you're just going in.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:10.000\nAre you because I don't I can't tell from the trailer.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:17.000\nAre you are you so like outside of the whole like concentric constant, the cosmology that\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:20.000\nyou're like, yeah, race is bullshit.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nAnd this guy is a white militant.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:23.000\nThis guy's a black militant.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.000\nI mean, what's the difference?\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nOr are you like actually just going, these are weirdos.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nLet's poke them or somewhere in between.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.000\nLike what's your kind of.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nI mean, did you know what?\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:31.000\nLike what?\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:35.000\nBecause I do stand up in it as well and just stand up, use words to the through line.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nAnd a lot of people would like, we have to tell them what the show is.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nAnd they were like, oh, he's going to take the piss out of me.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nI go, listen, I only take the piss out of your ideas.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:42.000\nI never take the piss out of you personally.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nI never say, and this fat dude or this skinny.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\nRight.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:46.000\nYou know, it weren't that.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nBut you say that to the subject.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:49.000\nYeah.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:50.000\nYeah.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:51.000\nYeah.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:52.000\nYeah.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:53.000\nYeah.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.000\nYeah.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:55.000\nYeah.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nYeah.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nYeah.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:58.000\nYeah.\n\n21:58.000 --> 21:59.000\nYeah.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:00.000\nYeah.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:01.000\nYou know what I'm going to do?\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:02.000\nI'm willing to hear you out.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:05.000\nBut then if there's something that comes up that I don't believe in, I'm going to say it.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:10.000\nAnd so when it cuts to you doing stand up in the show, I mean, are you, aren't you talking\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:11.000\nabout going and doing these interviews?\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:14.000\nAnd how are you not, how are you not taking the piss out of them?\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:15.000\nWell, I'm taking the piss out of their ideas.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:18.000\nSo I think if their ideas are being willing to put up, then they're being willing to take\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:19.000\nthe piss out.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:20.000\nRight.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:21.000\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:22.000\nYeah.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:23.000\nI feel like that's okay.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:24.000\nI mean, I don't think like those are people with no teeth.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:25.000\nI'm not going to say you no teeth.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:26.000\nReally?\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:27.000\nSo yeah.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:33.000\nI think that's like, you know, that's like my thing where I didn't want to do that because\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:34.000\nthat's easy.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:39.320\nThat's a line that we're becoming conscious of now that's like, it's like newly forming\n\n22:39.320 --> 22:44.400\nin the sand for us, especially with comedy, because it's like, if you're a big fat dude\n\n22:44.400 --> 22:52.560\nand you're racist, and I mean, it's like really like, it makes perfect sense to us that turn\n\n22:52.560 --> 22:55.240\nabout as fair play and we should just talk about how fat you are.\n\n22:55.240 --> 22:57.560\nAnd we're kind of like trying to find the lines there.\n\n22:57.560 --> 23:02.480\nLike we've just now figured out that you can't just talk about how disgustingly ugly Kellyanne\n\n23:02.480 --> 23:03.480\nConway is.\n\n23:03.480 --> 23:04.480\nYeah.\n\n23:04.480 --> 23:08.760\nLike you have to focus on the disgusting ugliness of her ideas.\n\n23:08.760 --> 23:12.480\nBecause I'm standing here and I say that I have all this morality.\n\n23:12.480 --> 23:17.400\nThere was one time where I did do that and took the piss out of them personally because\n\n23:17.400 --> 23:21.680\nthey insulted me so much because they basically like, basically what it is, I went to this\n\n23:21.680 --> 23:28.440\nbar in Georgia, you know what I should do, so I went to this bar and surprise, surprise,\n\n23:28.440 --> 23:30.000\nI weren't allowed in.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:31.840\nI think it's because I wear glasses, I don't know.\n\n23:31.840 --> 23:37.600\nSo they let me in and then the guy comes out and he's like saying like, look man, you\n\n23:37.600 --> 23:42.760\ncan't come in because we spoke to the other Nazis and we had a meeting and they said,\n\n23:42.760 --> 23:46.320\nif you come in, then we can't guarantee your safety, right?\n\n23:46.320 --> 23:49.720\nAnd the best bit was, I was with my all white camera crew and they said, the camera crew\n\n23:49.720 --> 23:52.120\ncan go in, but you can't go in, right?\n\n23:52.120 --> 23:53.640\nAnd I was like, that's fucked up.\n\n23:53.640 --> 23:57.120\nSo my camera crew went in, but little did they know that all of my camera crew were\n\n23:57.120 --> 23:58.120\nJewish.\n\n23:58.120 --> 24:04.920\nThey were the little Jews, but they went in and they're filming it and the owner of the\n\n24:04.920 --> 24:10.480\nbar comes across the road and he says, and he's like, why are you standing there with\n\n24:10.480 --> 24:11.480\nbinoculars?\n\n24:11.480 --> 24:18.680\nAnd I said like, oh, they said I can't come inside and then he goes, you can come inside\n\n24:18.680 --> 24:19.680\nnow.\n\n24:19.680 --> 24:23.720\nAnd I said, no, I won't go inside because at that point, I was like, if I'm not good\n\n24:23.720 --> 24:26.640\nenough, then I ain't good enough now.\n\n24:26.640 --> 24:28.920\nWhat changed their tune after time passed?\n\n24:28.920 --> 24:29.920\nBecause it wasn't the owner.\n\n24:29.920 --> 24:31.400\nIt had the owner of the Ku Klux Klan bar.\n\n24:31.400 --> 24:34.360\nThis is the best bit is I was telling him about all the races that I heard and at one\n\n24:34.360 --> 24:36.360\npoint he went, what, in my Klan bar?\n\n24:36.360 --> 24:37.360\nHe was surprised.\n\n24:37.360 --> 24:38.360\nWhat, here?\n\n24:38.360 --> 24:39.360\nOh, hell no.\n\n24:39.360 --> 24:40.360\nOh, here, sir.\n\n24:40.360 --> 24:41.360\nNo.\n\n24:41.360 --> 24:43.680\nAnd he was like, and then at one point he goes, you should come inside.\n\n24:43.680 --> 24:45.000\nWe've got good chicken wings.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:46.000\nI swear to God.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:49.000\nAnd I was like, I was pretty loaded.\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:50.000\nHe didn't say that.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:51.000\nThat's not bullshit.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:52.000\nAnd you're like, listen to my voice.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:53.000\nYeah.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:54.000\nDo you want to lie though?\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:55.000\nYou said, I won't hurry.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:58.640\nI like that he said he didn't say that, but he owns a Klan bar.\n\n24:58.640 --> 25:01.320\nSo stereotypes isn't really a line he won't cross.\n\n25:01.320 --> 25:05.400\nNo, it's like, it's putting such a fine point on it.\n\n25:05.400 --> 25:08.360\nIt's like, it's like, it's really committing to being the typical ass way.\n\n25:08.360 --> 25:11.560\nIt brings up an interesting point and also a scary area though, because I think a lot\n\n25:11.560 --> 25:16.440\nof us are more comfortable with the idea that that's what Nazis are.\n\n25:16.440 --> 25:22.080\nThe behavior you just described, that they're like sims that when they see a person of color,\n\n25:22.080 --> 25:26.800\nthey go, nope, nope, nope, because, because that sort of assures their destruction.\n\n25:26.800 --> 25:30.960\nIt's like, it's like looking at MP3s and being like, no, thank you as a record industry.\n\n25:30.960 --> 25:32.680\nYou're just like, okay, see you.\n\n25:32.680 --> 25:37.600\nAnd that's, that's, that's, that's, that's the hard part is because on that same episode,\n\n25:37.600 --> 25:38.600\nso how do that happen?\n\n25:38.600 --> 25:41.680\nAnd got, you know, I got my life friend, like someone friend to lynch me and stuff like\n\n25:41.680 --> 25:42.680\nthat.\n\n25:42.680 --> 25:46.280\nAnd to people, to people who sent lynch me.\n\n25:46.280 --> 25:52.080\nAnd then I went to this other guy's house named Dan, and, and Dan Burnside, and I spent\n\n25:52.080 --> 25:56.800\ntime with him and his family, his wife hating me, but he was, we, we built this weird relationship\n\n25:56.800 --> 26:00.600\nwhere he had these fucked up views that we were totally different on.\n\n26:00.600 --> 26:04.240\nBut then he was like, actually not a bad guy, it's just he had these messed up views.\n\n26:04.240 --> 26:06.280\nAnd that's where the weirdness came into it.\n\n26:06.280 --> 26:11.720\nLike, I'm trying to, you know, do this documentary with this guy where people like, he's a likable\n\n26:11.720 --> 26:18.000\nguy, but he just has these horrible views, and it's that weird thing of, you know, isn't\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:19.000\nit?\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:22.760\nI mean, we, we, we keep on, we had a guy that did a documentary, we didn't have the subject\n\n26:22.760 --> 26:26.040\nof it, and I can't remember his name and I should, but the subject of the documentary\n\n26:26.040 --> 26:30.960\nis this guy that in America for decades, that's been his thing is that he counsels probably\n\n26:30.960 --> 26:35.360\nmaybe with people you've sat down with, that he, he, he sits with them.\n\n26:35.360 --> 26:42.720\nHe's a black guy and he, and he collects their old uniforms and all this stuff, and he has\n\n26:42.720 --> 26:43.720\na big collection of them.\n\n26:43.720 --> 26:44.720\nYou saw that documentary?\n\n26:44.720 --> 26:47.520\nYeah, I didn't see the documentary, but I heard about it, but you should, you gotta\n\n26:47.520 --> 26:48.520\nwatch.\n\n26:48.520 --> 26:49.520\nFucking crazy.\n\n26:49.520 --> 26:50.520\nHe done people I did with as well.\n\n26:50.520 --> 26:51.520\nRight.\n\n26:51.520 --> 26:54.680\nThat name almost sounds familiar, that Burnside guy, because I remember that going like, that\n\n26:54.680 --> 26:59.160\nseems like a name that Rob Schrab would name something in a comic book, because it, the,\n\n26:59.160 --> 27:04.880\nthe, the, but isn't that the scarier thing, or I'll speak for myself, that is the scarier\n\n27:04.880 --> 27:05.880\nthing.\n\n27:05.880 --> 27:09.640\nIt's that, it's these, it's these Twitter conversations.\n\n27:09.640 --> 27:16.760\nIt's the idea that, that, oh, they, they're not just like keystone cops that live in basements\n\n27:16.760 --> 27:21.440\nand shine their jackboots under posters of Hitler that they only cover up if their Jewish\n\n27:21.440 --> 27:23.480\nmeter reader comes over.\n\n27:23.480 --> 27:30.640\nLike they're, they're, they're, they're out among us and they're, they're comfortable\n\n27:30.640 --> 27:35.960\nenough buying fruit loops in a grocery store full of people of different races.\n\n27:35.960 --> 27:41.520\nBut it does, that doesn't make them jump up on a box and say, I can't be in this room,\n\n27:41.520 --> 27:44.120\nthere's too many black people.\n\n27:44.120 --> 27:46.640\nBecause that would be easy to handle.\n\n27:46.640 --> 27:51.400\nAnd what's, what's scary is that they're just like, ha, ha, ha, and joking around with\n\n27:51.400 --> 27:53.640\nus and influencing elections.\n\n27:53.640 --> 27:57.800\nAnd like that, now that's, I mean, I wonder what's scary about that is that it's like,\n\n27:57.800 --> 28:02.840\nit forces us to do battle with ourselves because all of a sudden there's not just a cobra action\n\n28:02.840 --> 28:05.920\nfigure that you can throw down and say G.I. Joe won.\n\n28:05.920 --> 28:06.920\nYeah, yeah.\n\n28:06.920 --> 28:11.320\nWell, I mean, it's, it's, it's the sort of, it, it, because being with like the Nazis\n\n28:11.320 --> 28:15.000\nand the Klan and all of that, right, the dudes that wear the robe and wear the swastika\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:18.840\ntisha and walk around and go, like those guys,\n\n28:18.840 --> 28:19.840\nShut up, shut up.\n\n28:19.840 --> 28:20.840\nThat's what they do.\n\n28:20.840 --> 28:24.880\nLike, because I'm an expert in the Nazis, mirror, mirror, mirror, that's some secret.\n\n28:24.880 --> 28:33.480\nHey, language there for you, but anyway, dear Harmontown, I have never been more offended.\n\n28:33.480 --> 28:39.640\nAs I sit here in my compound sharpening my bayonet, I regret that America has fallen\n\n28:39.640 --> 28:41.360\nto bigotry.\n\n28:41.360 --> 28:49.320\nYour guest, Jamali Maddox, did an impression of a Nazi anyway, sorry.\n\n28:49.320 --> 28:54.080\nBut it's like, yeah, so it's like those dudes, uh, uh, funny enough aren't the scary ones\n\n28:54.080 --> 28:56.120\nbecause you know where they are.\n\n28:56.120 --> 28:58.520\nAnd to be completely honest with you, man, that's what's making, what's what kind of\n\n28:58.520 --> 29:03.640\nweird about it from, because I was making a film, I didn't want to be like, oh my God,\n\n29:03.640 --> 29:05.920\nworry about these eight guys, you know what I mean?\n\n29:05.920 --> 29:10.200\nBecause it is just eight guys doing, it's burning a swastika badly, right?\n\n29:10.200 --> 29:15.400\nBut it's the, it is the guys who then don't suits, you gotta worry about.\n\n29:15.400 --> 29:20.280\nIt's the guys that have, that have decided that's a marketplace and who maybe half believe\n\n29:20.280 --> 29:23.360\nthose guys and half don't and who at any rate are like, I like votes.\n\n29:23.360 --> 29:29.200\nBecause you can't, you can't, the thing is like, the thing of like this whole idea of\n\n29:29.200 --> 29:33.360\na white utopia where you're gonna walk around and only see other white people go, who a good\n\n29:33.360 --> 29:34.360\nwhite dude?\n\n29:34.360 --> 29:35.360\nIt doesn't exist.\n\n29:35.360 --> 29:36.360\nA good white dude?\n\n29:36.360 --> 29:37.360\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n29:37.360 --> 29:38.360\nOkay, like it's a little different.\n\n29:38.360 --> 29:41.360\nThe guy, the leader of that group lived in Detroit.\n\n29:41.360 --> 29:47.200\nHow, how can you live in Detroit and not once interact with anyone from any other race?\n\n29:47.200 --> 29:48.200\nYou can't.\n\n29:48.200 --> 29:49.200\nIt's literally important.\n\n29:49.200 --> 29:50.200\nYou would not eat.\n\n29:50.200 --> 29:52.200\nWell, what you see in that documentary, when you watch it.\n\n29:52.200 --> 29:53.880\nYou wouldn't eat, you wouldn't do nothing.\n\n29:53.880 --> 29:56.960\nWhen you watch that documentary, there's two things you might, you might notice.\n\n29:56.960 --> 30:02.400\nOne is that all of these guys get tired, like, like, I think racism and misogyny both kind\n\n30:02.400 --> 30:07.640\nof like, you don't become a good person, but you can get bored with hatred.\n\n30:07.640 --> 30:13.680\nLike you, especially if you are well healed, like prosperity and age, even independent\n\n30:13.680 --> 30:17.960\nof each other, but especially combined, there's nothing, there's nothing more harmless than\n\n30:17.960 --> 30:23.080\nan old, rich, former monster.\n\n30:23.080 --> 30:25.800\nThey're just like, did it, nailed it, bye.\n\n30:25.800 --> 30:29.280\nI'm gonna eat some Cheetos and play some video games and it's like they might not have atoned\n\n30:29.280 --> 30:32.640\nwith anything in themselves when the most active parts of their lives were, you know,\n\n30:32.640 --> 30:33.640\nthe most important.\n\n30:33.640 --> 30:37.920\nAnd so you see a lot of that and you also see young people of color asking the question\n\n30:37.920 --> 30:43.160\nof this older activist who, you know, is so admirable and is, it is, it is willingness\n\n30:43.160 --> 30:45.240\nto go into the mouth of a lion like that.\n\n30:45.240 --> 30:50.200\nBut then they're saying like, so you made 50 old ex-racist friends and we're out here\n\n30:50.200 --> 30:54.480\nin the streets inhaling tear gas with cops that say they're not racist and all this stuff.\n\n30:54.480 --> 30:56.800\nSo it's like, that's why you got to watch it because it's just fucking amazing.\n\n30:56.800 --> 31:00.520\nIt's one of those things where there's no heroes or villains, you just walk away bummed\n\n31:00.520 --> 31:02.720\nand confused and like freaking out.\n\n31:02.720 --> 31:04.720\nAnd then you go back to England and you're like, fuck them.\n\n31:04.720 --> 31:07.720\nWell, I've done the episode in England, it was the same show over there.\n\n31:07.720 --> 31:08.720\nYeah, yeah.\n\n31:08.720 --> 31:09.720\nWell, no, it might be worse.\n\n31:09.720 --> 31:10.720\nI don't know.\n\n31:10.720 --> 31:11.720\nI guess that's the other place that we can go.\n\n31:11.720 --> 31:13.440\nSo I wanted to talk to you about that.\n\n31:13.440 --> 31:15.560\nCan I ask you a quick question?\n\n31:15.560 --> 31:19.680\nWhen you do the show, without revealing too much about what the secret, the magic trick\n\n31:19.680 --> 31:24.040\nof making that show great, you know, like in the production side of it, but how much,\n\n31:24.040 --> 31:28.840\nlike, did that bar know you were coming or did you guys just roll up on that KKK bar\n\n31:28.840 --> 31:29.840\nin Georgia?\n\n31:29.840 --> 31:37.800\nWell, this was the issue is that, so my producers had to go to the bar the night before because\n\n31:37.800 --> 31:40.920\nthey were planning this swastika line because what it was, it was all these different white\n\n31:40.920 --> 31:45.120\npower groups coming together to form a super white power group and then they were coming\n\n31:45.120 --> 31:46.120\ntogether.\n\n31:46.120 --> 31:47.120\nRacist Voltron?\n\n31:47.120 --> 31:48.120\nYeah.\n\n31:48.120 --> 31:49.120\nYeah.\n\n31:49.120 --> 31:50.120\nRacist Voltron.\n\n31:50.120 --> 31:51.120\nJust go together.\n\n31:51.120 --> 31:53.080\nIt's like the Holocaust never happened, right?\n\n31:53.080 --> 31:55.440\nAs I say, we aren't the world.\n\n31:55.440 --> 31:57.080\nWe can't all be the right arm.\n\n31:57.080 --> 32:00.320\nWe can't all be the right arm.\n\n32:00.320 --> 32:01.320\nSomebody has to be a leg.\n\n32:01.320 --> 32:02.320\nThat's funny.\n\n32:02.320 --> 32:03.320\nIt's shit.\n\n32:03.320 --> 32:05.840\nBut yeah, so, yeah, so it was all, it was all that.\n\n32:05.840 --> 32:10.160\nAnd then so then they, so they had to go over there because our connect, our link was\n\n32:10.160 --> 32:15.040\nthe leader of the national socialist movement and he said we could.\n\n32:15.040 --> 32:17.880\nAnd then when we got there, they were like, so he was like, hey, I've got this documentary\n\n32:17.880 --> 32:18.880\nfrom group.\n\n32:18.880 --> 32:19.880\nOkay, okay.\n\n32:19.880 --> 32:23.480\nAnd the presenters, Brownskin, dude, yeah, he ain't coming in here, right?\n\n32:23.480 --> 32:26.360\nSo then my producers had to go and my producers there for like, I was trying to convince them\n\n32:26.360 --> 32:27.360\nto let me in.\n\n32:27.360 --> 32:28.680\nBut the one guy knew that you were coming in.\n\n32:28.680 --> 32:32.080\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he knew I was coming and then he got outnumbered in\n\n32:32.080 --> 32:37.240\nvotes, prepared that vote and so then they were like, he can't come inside or he can't\n\n32:37.240 --> 32:38.240\ncome.\n\n32:38.240 --> 32:43.920\nAnd then the guy came anyway with a deck chair and beers, like I knew they wouldn't let me\n\n32:43.920 --> 32:44.920\nin.\n\n32:44.920 --> 32:49.080\nSo I was watching the swastika line from the side of the road and then the guy came in\n\n32:49.080 --> 32:52.560\nbecause the owner wanted us to move the cars into the lot bit.\n\n32:52.560 --> 32:53.920\nAnd so the guy came in.\n\n32:53.920 --> 32:54.920\nSo then they knew I was there.\n\n32:54.920 --> 33:01.080\nWait, so there's a thousand Nazis doing a parade and you're a lone black dude with binoculars\n\n33:01.080 --> 33:02.080\nacross the street?\n\n33:02.080 --> 33:03.080\nYeah.\n\n33:03.080 --> 33:05.360\nThat seems like, like, seems a little risky.\n\n33:05.360 --> 33:06.360\nThat's fucking hilarious.\n\n33:06.360 --> 33:11.720\nYeah, man, no, I've done some dumb shit, but like, yeah, I don't matter, I don't, I\n\n33:11.720 --> 33:12.720\ndo not.\n\n33:12.720 --> 33:15.320\nI look back because like people ask me like, one of the main questions I get asked is,\n\n33:15.320 --> 33:16.320\nwas you scared?\n\n33:16.320 --> 33:19.920\nAnd it's like, not at the time, only when I get back to the hotel, because I've done\n\n33:19.920 --> 33:20.920\ndumb shit.\n\n33:20.920 --> 33:26.440\nLike, I went to this white power music festival in Ukraine and we didn't have security, like\n\n33:26.440 --> 33:27.440\nno security.\n\n33:27.440 --> 33:29.880\nLike, and I remember they, our vice asked me, do I want security?\n\n33:29.880 --> 33:34.280\nAnd I was like, no, man, no, Karoy, and I don't know Karoy, but I wanted to stay\n\n33:34.280 --> 33:38.320\nuncomfortable at the time, and we just got, and then people like threatened, you know,\n\n33:38.320 --> 33:42.880\nit's like a mad, you know, some mad things that I did, I wanted, I don't, yeah.\n\n33:42.880 --> 33:46.360\nWhat is it propelling you then, if fear isn't stopping you?\n\n33:46.360 --> 33:47.480\nWhat is propelling you?\n\n33:47.480 --> 33:48.480\nIs it?\n\n33:48.480 --> 33:54.520\nAnd what is it by the time I realized what I was doing, I already signed the contract\n\n33:54.520 --> 33:58.320\nto do the show, and you're like, I got to do the show right.\n\n33:58.320 --> 34:03.320\nThat would make me, if I, if I like accidentally sold myself as some kind of like social evil\n\n34:03.320 --> 34:05.600\nconneval, I would commit to it.\n\n34:05.600 --> 34:09.840\nI mean, if I was like, because I'd be like, fuck, I had the only thing worse than eating\n\n34:09.840 --> 34:17.240\nthis tarantula egg is looking like a dip shit, like, like, but like, this is like, I want\n\n34:17.240 --> 34:18.240\nto keep it funny.\n\n34:18.240 --> 34:19.240\nSo I'm sorry.\n\n34:19.240 --> 34:20.240\nIt's going to take a dip here.\n\n34:20.240 --> 34:21.840\nThey're used to dips on this show.\n\n34:21.840 --> 34:22.840\nI appreciate it.\n\n34:22.840 --> 34:27.120\nBut what, what, what kind of drove me with the show is hosted by a dip?\n\n34:27.120 --> 34:28.120\nOkay, Bruno.\n\n34:28.120 --> 34:31.560\nIt's like, I've done like the first episode and it was kind of light and then the second\n\n34:31.560 --> 34:33.480\nepisode got really heavy.\n\n34:33.480 --> 34:39.640\nAnd all I remember is that like the reason I carried on like, and was willing to do crazy\n\n34:39.640 --> 34:45.200\nshit and dumb shit was like, I went to that refugee camp and it was like the most oppressive\n\n34:45.200 --> 34:46.200\nthing I ever seen in my life.\n\n34:46.200 --> 34:47.200\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n34:47.200 --> 34:48.200\nIt was like sadness.\n\n34:48.200 --> 34:52.400\nLike, I, you know, I've never seen like sad, sad as shit in my life.\n\n34:52.400 --> 34:56.680\nAnd if I want to, if I'm not so sad, don't matter what spectrum on the political debate\n\n34:56.680 --> 35:02.680\nyou are, if you're right-wing or left-wing, that you can't negate how sad that thing is.\n\n35:02.680 --> 35:07.960\nAnd that kind of, and for people to sort of, not even just say, look, we don't want them\n\n35:07.960 --> 35:12.800\nhere for economic reasons and, you know, and those reasons, which, you know, which is debatable,\n\n35:12.800 --> 35:16.240\nyou know, you can have those debates, but it's the people saying, fuck them, they're\n\n35:16.240 --> 35:17.240\ndirty.\n\n35:17.240 --> 35:22.760\nYou know, that they're dirty and I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't not then go and, and\n\n35:22.760 --> 35:25.400\ntry and understand why the fuck they think like that.\n\n35:25.400 --> 35:26.400\nRight.\n\n35:26.400 --> 35:27.920\nThat's what I'm talking to that feels like that.\n\n35:27.920 --> 35:30.880\nIt's, it's all people that are only reading about it on Facebook, right?\n\n35:30.880 --> 35:32.360\nNobody that's ever come that close to.\n\n35:32.360 --> 35:33.360\nNo, of course.\n\n35:33.360 --> 35:34.360\nOf course.\n\n35:34.360 --> 35:35.360\nI mean, yeah, there's that, there's that as well.\n\n35:35.360 --> 35:43.160\nBut, you know, it's like, I know being there is way more heartfelt and, you know, visually\n\n35:43.160 --> 35:45.400\ncrazy and you dare and you, you feel it.\n\n35:45.400 --> 35:48.320\nBut even like watching that show on YouTube, I can't look at that and then be like, fuck\n\n35:48.320 --> 35:49.320\nthem.\n\n35:49.320 --> 35:50.320\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n35:50.320 --> 35:55.360\nNo, no, my therapist has alerted me to the fact that your, the cells in your body, including\n\n35:55.360 --> 36:02.080\nthe cells that react to light and symbolism and things like, your body doesn't have a\n\n36:02.080 --> 36:07.360\ngland that filters for Facebook and YouTube or film and TV.\n\n36:07.360 --> 36:12.640\nYour body, if it sees what is unmistakably a man who's been shot by a police officer\n\n36:12.640 --> 36:17.780\nand the gun is trembling in the cop's hand while his wife behind the camera is taping\n\n36:17.780 --> 36:21.160\nat his kids in the back seat and the blood seeps through his clothing.\n\n36:21.160 --> 36:26.160\nAnd you try to go to work that day and just get your world's greatest grandpa coffee mug\n\n36:26.160 --> 36:34.440\nand like, like, like we act like that's different, way more different than I saw a guy get shot\n\n36:34.440 --> 36:36.160\ntoday and watched him die.\n\n36:36.160 --> 36:40.400\nLike, like we, there may be some little difference because it was on Facebook and you could close\n\n36:40.400 --> 36:41.400\nthe laptop.\n\n36:41.400 --> 36:49.160\nBut your body experienced trauma and we, anyways, whatever, I, I, I, I explain things.\n\n36:49.160 --> 36:55.160\nThe, but, but, um, the, the, when you went, you went to a refugee camp, what I'm curious\n\n36:55.160 --> 37:00.280\nabout is because I, I feel like we keep hearing about this refugee crisis.\n\n37:00.280 --> 37:05.280\nNow, the crisis is that a bunch of people need to get the fuck out of somewhere where\n\n37:05.280 --> 37:06.720\nthey're going to die, right?\n\n37:06.720 --> 37:12.040\nAnd then you see transcripts of Trump talking to the Australian PM and it's like, he's\n\n37:12.040 --> 37:18.200\nlike, it's, it's 1200 people that Obama made a deal with to take in and like, like, like,\n\n37:18.200 --> 37:22.640\nthere's, there's people all over the place that need to get the hell out of dodge.\n\n37:22.640 --> 37:25.960\nAnd like, I'm not trying to get out of soapbox.\n\n37:25.960 --> 37:29.960\nWhat I'm trying to wrap my mind around is it's, it's sort of like this, the thing we\n\n37:29.960 --> 37:34.400\nhave in America where we have this like pedophile thing where there's a chart of like how much\n\n37:34.400 --> 37:39.840\nwe think about pedophilia and it doesn't correlate to a chart of pedophilia.\n\n37:39.840 --> 37:43.480\nAnd I'm wondering about this refugee thing, like how big is the problem?\n\n37:43.480 --> 37:48.800\nAnd the other thing I'm wondering is when you go to the site where you are face to\n\n37:48.800 --> 37:56.000\nface with a refugee, is there anyone in that area that is either that, that, that isn't\n\n37:56.000 --> 38:01.200\na paid to toe the line of like keeping them miserable?\n\n38:01.200 --> 38:02.200\nYeah.\n\n38:02.200 --> 38:05.480\nLike, like that person just has to, that, that's their job.\n\n38:05.480 --> 38:08.760\nIf you ask that person, they have to tell you, this is my job.\n\n38:08.760 --> 38:13.440\nIs there anybody, there's nobody around there that's going, yeah, keep them out.\n\n38:13.440 --> 38:18.200\nI mean, do you know, sure, this is, it's that kind of show.\n\n38:18.200 --> 38:19.200\nOh yeah.\n\n38:19.200 --> 38:21.040\nThat's, that's, I was like, shit.\n\n38:21.040 --> 38:29.480\nWell, first of all, are you going to attack me?\n\n38:29.480 --> 38:30.680\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n38:30.680 --> 38:36.320\nYou know, I was just sounded like you said Matthew McConaughey, but my name is Matthew\n\n38:36.320 --> 38:37.320\nMcConaughey.\n\n38:37.320 --> 38:38.320\nWhat's up, brother?\n\n38:38.320 --> 38:39.560\nWait, it's not, it's not your real name.\n\n38:39.560 --> 38:41.880\nWait, it's your, your name is close to that, but it's not.\n\n38:41.880 --> 38:43.640\nMy name is Matthew McConaughey.\n\n38:43.640 --> 38:44.640\nOh, McConaughey.\n\n38:44.640 --> 38:45.640\nMcConaughey.\n\n38:45.640 --> 38:46.640\nOkay.\n\n38:46.640 --> 38:47.640\nOkay.\n\n38:47.640 --> 38:48.640\nYeah.\n\n38:48.640 --> 38:49.640\nAll right.\n\n38:49.640 --> 38:50.640\nAll right.\n\n38:50.640 --> 38:51.640\nAll right.\n\n38:51.640 --> 38:52.640\nAll right.\n\n38:52.640 --> 38:53.640\nWithout revealing anything that's going to get me arrested, I used to serve in special\n\n38:53.640 --> 38:54.920\noperations from 2001 to 2007.\n\n38:54.920 --> 38:56.920\nCan you explain what special operations is?\n\n38:56.920 --> 39:01.160\nI was a ranger in third battalion 75th Ranger Regiment.\n\n39:01.160 --> 39:04.360\nCan you explain what that is?\n\n39:04.360 --> 39:09.880\nImagine that we've, most of us have just, from playing with Legos for 30 years.\n\n39:09.880 --> 39:12.000\nHe was in a super elite branch of the army.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:13.000\nOkay.\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:14.280\nLike the, the highly trained, like the Navy's had to seal.\n\n39:14.280 --> 39:16.400\nI mean, I can, I can sugarcoat it.\n\n39:16.400 --> 39:18.800\nI was really good at killing people.\n\n39:18.800 --> 39:20.880\nThe rangers are like the Navy seals up the army.\n\n39:20.880 --> 39:21.880\nWell, okay.\n\n39:21.880 --> 39:22.880\nThat's offensive.\n\n39:22.880 --> 39:23.880\nThat's offensive.\n\n39:23.880 --> 39:24.880\nLet's say that's another podcast.\n\n39:24.880 --> 39:25.880\nOkay.\n\n39:25.880 --> 39:26.880\nAll right.\n\n39:26.880 --> 39:27.880\nAll right.\n\n39:27.880 --> 39:28.880\nYou, you said it best.\n\n39:28.880 --> 39:29.880\nYour, your point is you, you've had elite access to.\n\n39:29.880 --> 39:30.880\nRight.\n\n39:30.880 --> 39:31.880\nNo, not even that.\n\n39:31.880 --> 39:35.520\nActually, before that I was in the big army, which is like the guys that join at a high\n\n39:35.520 --> 39:37.240\nschool and I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing.\n\n39:37.240 --> 39:38.760\nI'm going to play saxophone in the army band.\n\n39:38.760 --> 39:39.760\nOh, wait.\n\n39:39.760 --> 39:40.760\nI'm in the infantry.\n\n39:40.760 --> 39:41.760\nHere we go.\n\n39:41.760 --> 39:42.760\nI feel like this might break into it.\n\n39:42.760 --> 39:45.780\nLike a thing about, I know the truth about the Illuminati, man.\n\n39:45.780 --> 39:50.680\nSo I went to a Turkish refugee camp in Iraq in 2000.\n\n39:50.680 --> 39:51.680\nWhen did we invade Iraq?\n\n39:51.680 --> 39:52.680\nYeah.\n\n39:52.680 --> 39:55.000\nIt's been a long time for me.\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:56.000\nIt's been rough.\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.120\nI mean, we've never stopped invading Iraq.\n\n39:58.120 --> 39:59.120\nI think I know.\n\n39:59.120 --> 40:00.120\nYeah.\n\n40:00.120 --> 40:01.120\nWhen did that stop?\n\n40:01.120 --> 40:02.120\nIt's sort of like visiting your parents.\n\n40:02.120 --> 40:03.120\nI don't know.\n\n40:03.120 --> 40:04.120\nWe just do it when we need laundry done.\n\n40:04.120 --> 40:07.680\nI have so many friends who are still there and it's like, okay, good.\n\n40:07.680 --> 40:11.200\nSo yeah, I went there during the invasion invasion and then about like seven months\n\n40:11.200 --> 40:15.520\nin, we went to, I hope I'm not going to get killed for this.\n\n40:15.520 --> 40:20.160\nWe went to the Turkish, there's a Turkish refugee camp in Iraq and those people were\n\n40:20.160 --> 40:24.760\nso scared and really at the end of the day, what it comes down to is people are afraid.\n\n40:24.760 --> 40:30.960\nLike those people, they had a small armament there, like weapons that we didn't even have.\n\n40:30.960 --> 40:36.400\nLike 50 cal, they had at least three MAH deuces there, 50 caliber machine guns.\n\n40:36.400 --> 40:41.760\nThey had machine guns left over from World War II that I, which, you know, if I could\n\n40:41.760 --> 40:47.000\nhave saved them, I could be rich right now, but I didn't because I was young and dumb.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:50.320\nAnyways, it was really interesting to talk to these people.\n\n40:50.320 --> 40:53.080\nI bought an owl off of one of them for 40 bucks.\n\n40:53.080 --> 40:56.680\nIt was pretty cool.\n\n40:56.680 --> 41:01.000\nWas your job to keep people from getting somewhere?\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:02.000\nNo.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:09.200\nI used to show up every day, not die and not kill anybody, I guess, but sometimes, you\n\n41:09.200 --> 41:10.200\nknow.\n\n41:10.200 --> 41:11.200\nThat's my job.\n\n41:11.200 --> 41:12.200\nI know.\n\n41:12.200 --> 41:13.200\nYeah, exactly, yeah.\n\n41:13.200 --> 41:26.360\nWe were just, we're talking about refugee, like, we're talking about refugee, like, the\n\n41:26.360 --> 41:31.960\nfact that we're like, we're having these moral quandaries about whether we let in refugees\n\n41:31.960 --> 41:34.960\nwhether we judge them, police them, shut them out, and what I was saying was...\n\n41:34.960 --> 41:38.400\nHow many refugee camps are there in, where you live, that's up in the hills?\n\n41:38.400 --> 41:39.400\nWhat is that?\n\n41:39.400 --> 41:40.400\nThat's a...\n\n41:40.400 --> 41:41.400\nI drive up there all the time.\n\n41:41.400 --> 41:42.400\nWhat is that?\n\n41:42.400 --> 41:43.400\nThat's a...\n\n41:43.400 --> 41:44.400\nA little speed list.\n\n41:44.400 --> 41:45.400\nA little speed list.\n\n41:45.400 --> 41:46.400\nYeah.\n\n41:46.400 --> 41:47.400\nHow many refugee camps are there up there?\n\n41:47.400 --> 41:48.400\nThere's none.\n\n41:48.400 --> 41:53.120\nI think there's like a monastery that I'm a little suspicious of, but I think they mainly\n\n41:53.120 --> 41:54.120\ndo aromatherapy.\n\n41:54.120 --> 41:55.120\nHere's...\n\n41:55.120 --> 41:56.120\nHere's Katy Perry bought that, you know.\n\n41:56.120 --> 41:57.120\nShe did.\n\n41:57.120 --> 41:58.120\nOh, really?\n\n41:58.120 --> 41:59.120\nYeah.\n\n41:59.120 --> 42:00.120\nHere's my input on that is that...\n\n42:00.120 --> 42:05.080\nSo I've been to refugee camps, I bought an owl off of a kid that was probably something\n\n42:05.080 --> 42:07.920\nlike, you know, five foot nothing, 40 bucks.\n\n42:07.920 --> 42:08.920\nThe owl...\n\n42:08.920 --> 42:09.920\nAnd he tried to...\n\n42:09.920 --> 42:10.920\nThe kid...\n\n42:10.920 --> 42:11.920\nWas it a five foot owl or was it...?\n\n42:11.920 --> 42:12.920\nHis name was Harry Potter.\n\n42:12.920 --> 42:13.920\nThat...\n\n42:13.920 --> 42:14.920\nAll right, can you...\n\n42:14.920 --> 42:15.920\nAnd he was...\n\n42:15.920 --> 42:16.920\nNo, no.\n\n42:16.920 --> 42:17.920\nAnd he tried to...\n\n42:17.920 --> 42:18.920\nAnd he tried to...\n\n42:18.920 --> 42:19.920\nSo far, this sounds like a pretty cool refugee camp.\n\n42:19.920 --> 42:20.920\nIt was pretty cool.\n\n42:20.920 --> 42:23.920\nYou could buy guns with an owl?\n\n42:23.920 --> 42:24.920\nYeah.\n\n42:24.920 --> 42:25.920\nOh, yeah.\n\n42:25.920 --> 42:30.000\nThey had a ton of weapons, but at the end of the day, what it was, is they were scared,\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:34.440\nlike, they had no idea what was going on and we had just invaded their country, which they\n\n42:34.440 --> 42:35.440\nalready...\n\n42:35.440 --> 42:38.440\nIt wasn't even their country, like, they were...\n\n42:38.440 --> 42:42.800\nThey were guests in the country that was hosting them, that we...\n\n42:42.800 --> 42:45.920\nThey escaped from another country, and they...\n\n42:45.920 --> 42:53.560\nThis other country that we had largely reputed as being, well, it was led by Tyrant, but\n\n42:53.560 --> 42:54.560\nthey were scared.\n\n42:54.560 --> 42:55.560\nIt's fear.\n\n42:55.560 --> 42:59.960\nAt the end of the day, fear drives all human emotion, it drives all human activity, like,\n\n42:59.960 --> 43:00.960\nit's...\n\n43:00.960 --> 43:03.200\nAnd at the end of the day, like, you can...\n\n43:03.200 --> 43:08.240\nYou can talk shit about every human being that you want to, but fear is, like, what\n\n43:08.240 --> 43:09.240\ndrives us.\n\n43:09.240 --> 43:13.960\nIt's so overpowering, we're not better than fear, we're not better than what created\n\n43:13.960 --> 43:14.960\nus.\n\n43:14.960 --> 43:18.640\nI'm still trying to place you on a map of ideology, though, because I felt like we were\n\n43:18.640 --> 43:21.640\njust talking about, like, something that didn't even really have a gender to it.\n\n43:21.640 --> 43:22.640\nOh, yeah, and I'm crazy, yeah.\n\n43:22.640 --> 43:26.920\nI went to the DNC, I went to the Democratic National Convention, and I was a burnicrat,\n\n43:26.920 --> 43:30.840\nand I got chewed out by a bunch of people that hated me.\n\n43:30.840 --> 43:31.840\nBut you...\n\n43:31.840 --> 43:32.840\nWoo!\n\n43:32.840 --> 43:35.320\nBut I also used to kill people for a living, and I was really good at it.\n\n43:35.320 --> 43:38.680\nYou presented yourself as if you had a kind of counterpoint, like, we were talking about\n\n43:38.680 --> 43:39.680\nhow refugee camps are bad.\n\n43:39.680 --> 43:40.680\nI'm talking about refugee camps.\n\n43:40.680 --> 43:41.680\nYou're like...\n\n43:41.680 --> 43:44.560\nWell, I've got a thing or two about that, and you're like, you've got to remember, they're\n\n43:44.560 --> 43:49.680\nshitty places, and everyone's scared, and I bought an owl.\n\n43:49.680 --> 43:50.960\nAnd I don't...\n\n43:50.960 --> 43:51.960\nThat's fair.\n\n43:51.960 --> 43:56.120\nAnd he said, if he could do one thing different, he would have bought more weapons from them,\n\n43:56.120 --> 43:57.120\nbecause he would be rich.\n\n43:57.120 --> 43:58.120\nThat's true.\n\n43:58.120 --> 43:59.640\nHow many weapons have you bought from refugee camps in your life?\n\n43:59.640 --> 44:03.080\nThat's the second time you've done that, that thing, like, are you high-roading me about\n\n44:03.080 --> 44:04.080\nrefugee camps?\n\n44:04.080 --> 44:05.640\nLike, how many have I done this?\n\n44:05.640 --> 44:06.640\nJust the one.\n\n44:06.640 --> 44:07.640\nYeah.\n\n44:07.640 --> 44:08.640\nWell, you're not embracing...\n\n44:08.640 --> 44:09.640\nThat's fair.\n\n44:09.640 --> 44:11.960\n...the profit of possibilities of going to a refugee camp.\n\n44:11.960 --> 44:12.960\nBut what...\n\n44:12.960 --> 44:18.360\nI was providing my input as to actual refugee camps in a war zone, like the real world that\n\n44:18.360 --> 44:19.480\nwe don't live in currently.\n\n44:19.480 --> 44:20.640\nThey're bad places.\n\n44:20.640 --> 44:22.120\nTheir refugee camps are bad places.\n\n44:22.120 --> 44:23.120\nLet's see if we're...\n\n44:23.120 --> 44:24.120\nWell, are they?\n\n44:24.120 --> 44:25.120\nLet's see if we're Matthew McConnelly.\n\n44:25.120 --> 44:26.120\nMatthew McConnelly.\n\n44:26.120 --> 44:27.120\nThank you, sir.\n\n44:27.120 --> 44:28.120\nSpecial ops.\n\n44:28.120 --> 44:29.120\nThank you, Dan.\n\n44:29.120 --> 44:30.120\nLet me say one point, though.\n\n44:30.120 --> 44:31.120\nOh, sir, sir, sir.\n\n44:31.120 --> 44:32.120\nFuck that guy.\n\n44:32.120 --> 44:33.120\nThat guy.\n\n44:33.120 --> 44:35.120\nThat kind of scared me a bit.\n\n44:35.120 --> 44:36.120\nBut...\n\n44:36.120 --> 44:37.120\nA little bit.\n\n44:37.120 --> 44:39.120\nBut, like, it's like, I went to two.\n\n44:39.120 --> 44:41.120\nI went one in Sweden, and I went one in...\n\n44:41.120 --> 44:42.120\nI went to the Cannes one.\n\n44:42.120 --> 44:43.120\nNot the Cannes one.\n\n44:43.120 --> 44:44.120\nThat's the film thing.\n\n44:44.120 --> 44:46.120\nI went to the one in Calais.\n\n44:46.120 --> 44:47.120\nI went to the refugee camp in Calais.\n\n44:47.120 --> 44:52.560\nI went to the one in Sweden, was, you know, there was a lot more sort of hope there, and\n\n44:52.560 --> 44:56.840\nthere's a lot more, you know, people sort of thaw at the end of the tunnel in terms of,\n\n44:56.840 --> 44:57.840\nyou know...\n\n44:57.840 --> 44:59.840\nWell, yeah, because Swedish refugees, I mean, what are they, fleeing massage?\n\n44:59.840 --> 45:00.840\nYeah.\n\n45:00.840 --> 45:01.840\nNo, these are...\n\n45:01.840 --> 45:02.840\nThis is a refugee camp.\n\n45:02.840 --> 45:04.240\nI mean, these are entitled people.\n\n45:04.240 --> 45:05.840\nI got to get out of Sweden.\n\n45:05.840 --> 45:08.600\nThis chocolate is too creamy.\n\n45:08.600 --> 45:16.040\nI got to build my own furniture.\n\n45:16.040 --> 45:17.560\nAre these Syrian refugees, I'm assuming?\n\n45:17.560 --> 45:19.640\nYeah, these are from all over.\n\n45:19.640 --> 45:23.520\nBut then, while I will say that, so there is, you know, I did see a difference, you know,\n\n45:23.520 --> 45:26.920\nand I went to the one in Calais, the day it burned down.\n\n45:26.920 --> 45:28.240\nAnd that was the fucked up one.\n\n45:28.240 --> 45:30.640\nThat's the one that kind of changed my life a bit, watching that.\n\n45:30.640 --> 45:33.200\nWhy did the camp burn down?\n\n45:33.200 --> 45:37.560\nBecause there's two stories that I heard that day.\n\n45:37.560 --> 45:38.560\nNumber one is...\n\n45:38.560 --> 45:41.960\nBecause basically it was the day that they were kicking everyone out to bulldoze it over.\n\n45:41.960 --> 45:45.640\nAnd one of the accounts was that the refugees were burning down their homes, and the account\n\n45:45.640 --> 45:52.360\nnumber two was that there was sort of a nationalist firing, nationalist burning down their homes.\n\n45:52.360 --> 45:58.320\nAnd so there was two counteracted, but like I saw one guy, who my camera guy knew, who\n\n45:58.320 --> 45:59.320\nwas...\n\n45:59.320 --> 46:04.240\nSo my camera guy's walking and he sees this guy and he just hugs him, and this guy, he's\n\n46:04.240 --> 46:08.040\nlooked like he hasn't like fucking slept for like a year, and he's just covered in\n\n46:08.040 --> 46:09.040\nsoot.\n\n46:09.040 --> 46:10.040\nHasn't worked for a year?\n\n46:10.040 --> 46:12.600\nHe's slept for a year, and he's covered in dust and dirt.\n\n46:12.600 --> 46:17.360\nAnd he was saying how like, wear all these fires, he's just like a volunteer fire guy,\n\n46:17.360 --> 46:21.520\nand he's going and fighting these fires that are being kicked off, because all that generators\n\n46:21.520 --> 46:24.120\nand stuff, so it's just catching the light in that.\n\n46:24.120 --> 46:26.120\nI don't understand brave people.\n\n46:26.120 --> 46:30.600\nAnd that includes Matthew Mcconnelly and you, and some journalists we've had up here.\n\n46:30.600 --> 46:38.360\nMy hat's off to anybody that serves and that is fleeing.\n\n46:38.360 --> 46:40.280\nThere was a quote I saw on Twitter.\n\n46:40.280 --> 46:43.720\nIt's just black and goes to a KKK bar in Georgia.\n\n46:43.720 --> 46:44.720\nThat's fucking...\n\n46:44.720 --> 46:45.720\nThat's not brave.\n\n46:45.720 --> 46:46.720\nThat's just nuts.\n\n46:46.720 --> 46:47.720\nYeah, that's just dumb.\n\n46:47.720 --> 46:48.720\nThere's no bravery.\n\n46:48.720 --> 46:53.680\nI think bravery is kind of like, you know, all I did was just make a mediocre hour show.\n\n46:53.680 --> 46:57.840\nThere wasn't like, oh, bravery, you know, I was cutting this line, bro.\n\n46:57.840 --> 47:01.840\nYou've been doing stand-up and I've seen it and it's like, you're very good.\n\n47:01.840 --> 47:06.760\nLike you've been doing it for like four years and like, but that's not your roots, right?\n\n47:06.760 --> 47:07.760\nOr is it?\n\n47:07.760 --> 47:08.760\nLike what was your...\n\n47:08.760 --> 47:12.640\nLike before I'd done this, the documentary, I was just stand-up.\n\n47:12.640 --> 47:19.600\nI tried to act and I was awful, man, and I probably delivered the lines like, give me\n\n47:19.600 --> 47:20.600\nyour money now.\n\n47:20.600 --> 47:21.600\nNow.\n\n47:21.600 --> 47:24.840\nIt was fucking horrible.\n\n47:24.840 --> 47:25.840\nAnd then...\n\n47:25.840 --> 47:26.840\nBut yeah, I was at stand-up, man.\n\n47:26.840 --> 47:32.320\nSo I done my first show at 16 and I got brutal stage and then I didn't do it again until\n\n47:32.320 --> 47:33.320\nI was like 18.\n\n47:33.320 --> 47:34.320\nAnd then I...\n\n47:34.320 --> 47:36.320\nYou must be quite young now, then.\n\n47:36.320 --> 47:37.320\nI'm 26 now.\n\n47:37.320 --> 47:38.320\nOkay.\n\n47:38.320 --> 47:39.320\n22-year-olds don't think so.\n\n47:39.320 --> 47:40.320\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n47:40.320 --> 47:41.320\nThat's like a weird thing.\n\n47:41.320 --> 47:44.320\nIt's like the oldest I've been.\n\n47:44.320 --> 47:45.320\nYeah, exactly.\n\n47:45.320 --> 47:48.320\nSo I can't look at it until you're like, oh, I'm really...\n\n47:48.320 --> 47:49.320\nI'm just the oldest.\n\n47:49.320 --> 47:50.320\nThis is the furthest I've lived.\n\n47:50.320 --> 47:55.320\nI remember 27 is the worst because you're too old to complain but you're too young to\n\n47:55.320 --> 47:56.320\ncomplain about that.\n\n47:56.320 --> 47:57.320\nHow old are you?\n\n47:57.320 --> 48:01.840\nAnd so at 27, you just spend a year at the object of judgment of everyone older and\n\n48:01.840 --> 48:02.840\nyounger than you.\n\n48:02.840 --> 48:06.960\nThey're like, fuck you, old slash young man.\n\n48:06.960 --> 48:10.040\nI like that you sort of ruin my next birthday.\n\n48:10.040 --> 48:11.040\nYeah.\n\n48:11.040 --> 48:12.040\nBut I will tell you this.\n\n48:12.040 --> 48:13.040\nYou see your next birthday?\n\n48:13.040 --> 48:14.400\nThat whole year is going to be terrible.\n\n48:14.400 --> 48:21.280\nBut 27, I think, is the best, like short of 29, but 27 I think is a little better because\n\n48:21.280 --> 48:23.320\nit's syllabically more complicated.\n\n48:23.320 --> 48:29.440\nI find syllabically complicated, odd-numbered birthdays are fucking fantastic for when\n\n48:29.440 --> 48:35.280\nyou want to say, I'm blank years old, I don't have to put up with this shit, whether it's\n\n48:35.280 --> 48:42.120\nhelping someone move, driving to the airport, or buying a Honda, whatever, you can just\n\n48:42.120 --> 48:43.120\nrandomly apply it.\n\n48:43.120 --> 48:47.920\nIf somebody is like, well, maybe you should get this car and you're like, I'm 27 years\n\n48:47.920 --> 48:49.360\nold, I don't need that fucking car.\n\n48:49.360 --> 48:52.160\nAnd they're like, wow, that sounds like he's true.\n\n48:52.160 --> 48:54.640\nIt's a great point in your foot down here.\n\n48:54.640 --> 48:59.360\nI'm constantly saying now I'm 44 years old, it just doesn't sound legit.\n\n48:59.360 --> 49:00.360\nThey're like, so?\n\n49:00.360 --> 49:02.400\nYeah, you still got to do shit before we go.\n\n49:02.400 --> 49:09.640\nTalk to us when you're 47, wait, I'm 47 years old, we're having a clown on the show.\n\n49:09.640 --> 49:13.240\nPeople will be like, no, Dan, he's close to death.\n\n49:13.240 --> 49:14.760\nHe speaks with that power.\n\n49:14.760 --> 49:17.440\nSpencer, how old are you?\n\n49:17.440 --> 49:22.400\nI'm 28, no, 27, 8, 28.\n\n49:22.400 --> 49:29.200\nSee, 27 is a birthday you don't even want to admit, so you just want to put leaves on\n\n49:29.200 --> 49:30.200\nit and run away.\n\n49:30.200 --> 49:34.120\nHe took a year less life to say, I'm 28, I'll take a year less.\n\n49:34.120 --> 49:36.760\nI think we'd all skip 27 if we could, for some reason.\n\n49:36.760 --> 49:40.960\nBut there's that one thing you can just say at Hot Topic, I'm 27 years old, yes, get\n\n49:40.960 --> 49:42.440\nout the XL's.\n\n49:42.440 --> 49:48.760\nHey, Jamali, how many of the episodes, you said you did six already, you got 10 more\n\n49:48.760 --> 49:49.760\ncoming up, you said?\n\n49:49.760 --> 49:52.240\nOh yeah, down off the first was to say that, but fuck I could say.\n\n49:52.240 --> 49:55.240\nYeah, I'm doing, I might be doing more, I think.\n\n49:55.240 --> 49:56.760\nOh, are we allowed to talk about that?\n\n49:56.760 --> 49:57.760\nI don't know, man.\n\n49:57.760 --> 49:58.760\nThere was one thing, you were telling me...\n\n49:58.760 --> 50:01.560\nI don't read the contract, but I'm sure they'll sue me if I fuck it up.\n\n50:01.560 --> 50:02.560\nI'm sorry.\n\n50:02.560 --> 50:03.560\nCan you talk?\n\n50:03.560 --> 50:04.560\nI don't read that.\n\n50:04.560 --> 50:06.040\nWhat if I just got your show cancelled?\n\n50:06.040 --> 50:07.040\nYeah.\n\n50:07.040 --> 50:08.040\nThat'd be amazing.\n\n50:08.040 --> 50:12.480\nThere was a guy you were telling me about today, when we first met.\n\n50:12.480 --> 50:14.360\nYou told me about the fish guy, but...\n\n50:14.360 --> 50:15.360\nOh yeah, not after that.\n\n50:15.360 --> 50:16.360\nYeah, okay, yeah.\n\n50:16.360 --> 50:20.200\nYou'll have to wait for the fish guy, and you won't know who's the fish guy, because\n\n50:20.200 --> 50:22.480\nthe fish had nothing to do with it.\n\n50:22.480 --> 50:28.680\nBut so, just as an ambassador of the UK, like what, so since November, but also it's like\n\n50:28.680 --> 50:32.760\nit was like, Brexit was happening, and then November was happening in the States, the\n\n50:32.760 --> 50:36.920\nelections were happening around the same time, but there was like, Trump was tweeting, they're\n\n50:36.920 --> 50:42.360\ngoing to call me Mr. Brexit, because I think his point was, it's kind of like talking about\n\n50:42.360 --> 50:43.360\na dolphin.\n\n50:43.360 --> 50:50.160\nI think what he was saying was like, everyone keeps assuming that nationalism doesn't have\n\n50:50.160 --> 50:57.120\na foothold, but pretty soon they're going to say, I'm also a nationalist, like guess\n\n50:57.120 --> 50:58.120\nwhat I'm sorry.\n\n50:58.120 --> 51:05.840\nI'm not curious, like on the world stage now, it was easy three years ago to say, you didn't\n\n51:05.840 --> 51:15.080\neven have to ask a Canadian or an Englander, or an Englishman, or any of these other yahoes.\n\n51:15.080 --> 51:18.080\nYou never had to say like, what do you think about America, because you knew the answer\n\n51:18.080 --> 51:23.280\nwould be like, pfft, not America, pfft, and you'd be like, you're jealous.\n\n51:23.280 --> 51:29.880\nNow it's actually, the irony of nationalism, it seems to me, is that it's like, we're all\n\n51:29.880 --> 51:34.400\nexperimenting on a global scale, this is happening all over the world, all the countries are\n\n51:34.400 --> 51:41.920\nbecoming more childish, more secure, more isolated, which actually makes the conversations\n\n51:41.920 --> 51:46.800\nlike, what do you think about America, more interesting and like less predictable, because\n\n51:46.800 --> 51:51.640\nit's like, what has been happening over there?\n\n51:51.640 --> 51:54.000\nHow do you guys, we're over here, like kind of going like-\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.520\nAre you asking me, how do we process America now in England?\n\n51:56.520 --> 51:59.520\nYeah, like what's, I mean, obviously the answer is that you can't make a statement for all\n\n51:59.520 --> 52:03.400\nof England, but with circles you run in, or like the, I don't know, like what's the-\n\n52:03.400 --> 52:11.680\nWell, I mean, we kind of had the rise of sort of like really more hard to write politics\n\n52:11.680 --> 52:16.560\nin England, and I think it's sort of been, I think it's the same as, and I think people\n\n52:16.560 --> 52:22.000\nI speak to kind of understand that like, a large pusher of the more right-wing ideas\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:27.240\nis because of the large push of the other left-wing ideas, you know, and I think when\n\n52:27.240 --> 52:32.600\nboth of those ideas get bigger, they sort of react on the others, and everyone's left\n\n52:32.600 --> 52:35.800\nin the center, you know what I'm saying, it's like, you know, other like, you know, I'm\n\n52:35.800 --> 52:40.040\nnot far left-wing, but I'm not far right-wing, you know, there's people in the middle, and\n\n52:40.040 --> 52:44.320\nthat debate's never spoken about, and it's like, we've always kind of had this idea\n\n52:44.320 --> 52:49.000\nthat you people were crazy, that we always have, like, your coaxes are too big, your\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:51.880\nfood's too big, everything's just too big, like, we just think you're mental when you're\n\n52:51.880 --> 52:52.880\nso big.\n\n52:52.880 --> 52:53.880\nYou were like the Las Vegas of the planet.\n\n52:53.880 --> 52:55.440\nYeah, yeah, like, we think you're crazy.\n\n52:55.440 --> 52:58.480\nEverything's legal over there, it's better to have a TV show there.\n\n52:58.480 --> 53:02.360\nYou know, now we think, you know, it's, so it's like, you know, I wasn't mad shocked\n\n53:02.360 --> 53:06.320\nwhen Trump got in power, you know what I mean, I wasn't, you know, me personally, I wasn't\n\n53:06.320 --> 53:10.120\nshocked, you know what I'm saying, because I think what Trump does, because I kind of\n\n53:10.120 --> 53:12.720\nfelt it in England of there, it's sort of like-\n\n53:12.720 --> 53:16.440\nOh boy, it's that time when Spencer's car gets broken into.\n\n53:16.440 --> 53:17.440\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n53:17.440 --> 53:19.840\nI could go take care of that.\n\n53:19.840 --> 53:23.320\nIs that a serious thing that happens?\n\n53:23.320 --> 53:25.480\nYeah, it really is his car.\n\n53:25.480 --> 53:26.480\nOh, is it really?\n\n53:26.480 --> 53:30.560\nI thought he was just using that as a cheap opportunity to go get high.\n\n53:30.560 --> 53:31.560\nYeah, yeah, right.\n\n53:31.560 --> 53:35.200\nThat could, I mean, Spencer would have like an egg timer, yeah, that his car, he tells\n\n53:35.200 --> 53:40.920\nhis car, call me out to get high at ten minutes before.\n\n53:40.920 --> 53:43.240\nThe weed, the weed is way too strong here.\n\n53:43.240 --> 53:44.240\nThe weed is strong here.\n\n53:44.240 --> 53:45.240\nOh, the weed is ridiculous here.\n\n53:45.240 --> 53:46.240\nOh, because you guys are like-\n\n53:46.240 --> 53:47.240\nIt blew my mind.\n\n53:47.240 --> 53:48.240\nYeah.\n\n53:48.240 --> 53:50.240\nI, I, no, don't cheer it, it's disgusting.\n\n53:50.240 --> 53:51.240\nI hate it.\n\n53:51.240 --> 53:52.240\nNah, man.\n\n53:52.240 --> 53:53.240\nNah, that weed is too much, man.\n\n53:53.240 --> 53:54.240\nThis is not, you can't, you can't enjoy it.\n\n53:54.240 --> 53:55.240\nIt's just, I can't.\n\n53:55.240 --> 53:56.240\nYeah.\n\n53:56.240 --> 53:57.240\nI'm saying, I-\n\n53:57.240 --> 54:05.240\nWell, I, I agree with that, but I'm from the country of 44, like, like, like, like, but\n\n54:05.240 --> 54:10.720\nit's, yeah, I, I, I, I, I, fuck Harmon, get your shit together.\n\n54:10.720 --> 54:17.080\nUm, there, there are people from the Rangers here tonight, um, fucking, have some fucking\n\n54:17.080 --> 54:18.080\nintegrity.\n\n54:18.080 --> 54:23.640\nUm, I, I got a, I got a tin of mints that were like, like, it's like, they're like,\n\n54:23.640 --> 54:28.920\nit is like, there's this gourmet kind of like, that's the nice thing about legalization\n\n54:28.920 --> 54:34.680\nis like, now there's like, this guy gave me, he's, he's shooting some stuff with Starburns\n\n54:34.680 --> 54:38.920\nand it's about drugs and so some people, some companies gave him some stuff and I get like\n\n54:38.920 --> 54:46.440\nthis gourmet, like, like, like gilded, like, 80s dark chocolate kind of, like, wrapping\n\n54:46.440 --> 54:52.040\nand like, there's a, there's mints and they're like, you suck on one and you get just barely\n\n54:52.040 --> 54:58.120\nhigh, like, for two hours and it's, anyways, that wasn't worth commenting on.\n\n54:58.120 --> 55:02.640\nThere is, there is a little, I mean, I think that the kids these days, which you are one,\n\n55:02.640 --> 55:07.520\nbut you've, you've invaded American soil, but I think the kids your age here, they're\n\n55:07.520 --> 55:12.720\nlike, they're like, they're fucking desensitized or something, like, they're smoking some monster\n\n55:12.720 --> 55:13.720\ngonj raw.\n\n55:13.720 --> 55:18.840\nI just, I just don't think we should be grown by dudes in lab coats, like, I don't want\n\n55:18.840 --> 55:20.280\nto smoke that, that's, that's too much.\n\n55:20.280 --> 55:24.480\nI mean, I feel it should be legally okay for that stuff to happen, but it should happen\n\n55:24.480 --> 55:28.440\nlike, it should happen while Richard Attenborough is watching and like, like, yeah, it should\n\n55:28.440 --> 55:34.280\nhave, there should be a different thing, like, I, I, I mean, weed got you high, that's how\n\n55:34.280 --> 55:37.720\nwe found it, you know, like, it didn't need to be like cross-bredged.\n\n55:37.720 --> 55:40.600\nI'm not saying, I'm not, I'm not saying we should make it legal, but I'm just saying\n\n55:40.600 --> 55:42.560\nit for my, for my personal taste is too much.\n\n55:42.560 --> 55:43.560\nYeah, no, that's all.\n\n55:43.560 --> 55:44.560\nI'm saying the same thing.\n\n55:44.560 --> 55:45.560\nAnd I'm saying, hey.\n\n55:45.560 --> 55:46.560\nOh, cool.\n\n55:46.560 --> 55:47.560\nI'll have another debate on legalization.\n\n55:47.560 --> 55:48.560\nWe're on the same side, bro.\n\n55:48.560 --> 55:51.840\nI'm saying once it's, once it's so legal that it's all good everywhere, I'm saying there\n\n55:51.840 --> 55:56.760\nwill be the emergence of these things that I am old enough to find, which is like, casual.\n\n55:56.760 --> 55:57.760\nThe old dude weed.\n\n55:57.760 --> 56:03.240\nPerhaps me eating you out should be a little more psychedelic, you know, like, just kind\n\n56:03.240 --> 56:10.760\nof like, forensic files amount of weed, you know, like, like, that was a pair of bifocals\n\n56:10.760 --> 56:13.280\nshould make tonight's quite an event.\n\n56:13.280 --> 56:20.720\nI went into a, Jamali, I traveled a comedy group, and Greg Poops is a comic, if you're\n\n56:20.720 --> 56:27.160\naware of him, and Greg, Greg smokes the strongest weed on the planet Earth, as he says, he\n\n56:27.160 --> 56:34.200\nis like, where do you, where do you get that he goes from Dagobah, if I give his weed\n\n56:34.200 --> 56:36.000\na stern look, I'm fucking dead.\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:41.640\nLike it's, it's, but we walked into a, we're up in up, uh, upstate Washington, where the\n\n56:41.640 --> 56:46.040\nweed is very, that was like, it's totally freely, reparationally available.\n\n56:46.040 --> 56:50.600\nAnd we walked in there and this is all the, it's like 10 a.m. and these four like stoner\n\n56:50.600 --> 56:54.600\ndudes that are working there, who all clearly know the show that we're on.\n\n56:54.600 --> 57:00.360\nAnd they just, they're all really high in the morning, like, oh, so Greg is like buying\n\n57:00.360 --> 57:04.760\nlike the funkiest, hardest ass, he's like, I'll take one of those, five of these, a double\n\n57:04.760 --> 57:09.400\nwhammy, a triple walnut, like he knows all the, all the, all the, you know, the whammy\n\n57:09.400 --> 57:11.840\nand the walnuts, man.\n\n57:11.840 --> 57:17.240\nThat might have been the ice cream place, but, uh, but, uh, I, I had to talk to the\n\n57:17.240 --> 57:19.880\nguy, I'm like, what's the weakest shit?\n\n57:19.880 --> 57:24.000\nAnd, and, and, and, and what's the sticiest, like the, just the worst, like what, like,\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:25.160\nwhat wouldn't you smoke?\n\n57:25.160 --> 57:28.800\nAnd Greg had to walk over to him and like explain, like, like slum it.\n\n57:28.800 --> 57:32.200\nLike, like, what's stuff that you would be bummed out if somebody offered it to you?\n\n57:32.200 --> 57:35.400\nAnd I took that and I went and got some chocolates at this place in Seattle and I sat in my\n\n57:35.400 --> 57:36.680\nhotel room, it was the best.\n\n57:36.680 --> 57:37.680\nYeah.\n\n57:37.680 --> 57:41.920\nI, I was as high as I could possibly be, but like, Greg stuff, forget about it.\n\n57:41.920 --> 57:42.920\nYeah.\n\n57:42.920 --> 57:46.520\nI just, I, if I go to Portland or somebody, I got, I got, I just, I just go like, I'm,\n\n57:46.520 --> 57:48.800\nmy grandma has back pain.\n\n57:48.800 --> 57:56.160\nAnd then they give me what gets me high enough to like have a, end up on TMZ.\n\n57:56.160 --> 57:57.160\nYes, yes, yes.\n\n57:57.160 --> 57:58.160\nMy, my, my, my wish.\n\n57:58.160 --> 58:00.160\nMy pair of kids in the story flow.\n\n58:00.160 --> 58:01.920\nI hit you with a lot of stuff though.\n\n58:01.920 --> 58:04.520\nYou're like, wait, am I what?\n\n58:04.520 --> 58:10.500\nBut I did want to ask you, like, so, so just now let's talk about comedy, but relating\n\n58:10.500 --> 58:11.500\nto politics.\n\n58:11.500 --> 58:16.760\nBecause here you are, you're half my age, you're British, and, and, but now we're living\n\n58:16.760 --> 58:17.760\nthrough this time.\n\n58:17.760 --> 58:25.760\nSo, your perspective is totally different from mine, but like, what is a comedic creative's\n\n58:25.760 --> 58:33.760\nobligation or what, what is a good philosophy to follow when shit hits the fan on a global\n\n58:33.760 --> 58:35.480\nscale this much?\n\n58:35.480 --> 58:44.760\nBecause I can't, I just keep falling back on, if it seems like you're in a history book,\n\n58:44.760 --> 58:48.960\nthen politics aren't politics, they're current events.\n\n58:48.960 --> 58:53.800\nIf it doesn't seem that way, but, but I don't know if how much of that is a refraction of\n\n58:53.800 --> 58:57.800\nlike, but, but you're, so what's, what have you thought about this, like, how political\n\n58:57.800 --> 58:58.800\nam I allowed to be?\n\n58:58.800 --> 59:02.480\nYeah, no, I, I, do you know what, like when it comes to comedy and writing comedy is,\n\n59:02.480 --> 59:08.520\nis, it's like, I try to, to just be honest about how I feel about that thing and not\n\n59:08.520 --> 59:12.240\ntry and tell the line of, of being like, I'm going to say this because I think this has\n\n59:12.240 --> 59:13.240\na moral obligation.\n\n59:13.240 --> 59:15.240\nDo you know what I'm saying?\n\n59:15.240 --> 59:16.240\nI don't think I'm morally obligated to wear anything.\n\n59:16.240 --> 59:17.240\nRight.\n\n59:17.240 --> 59:18.240\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n59:18.240 --> 59:19.240\nLike I'm a free person.\n\n59:19.240 --> 59:22.280\nAnd, and like, my person, and my thing as well is like, I'm not even like, I'm willing\n\n59:22.280 --> 59:24.760\nto hear a point of view I don't agree with in comedy sometimes.\n\n59:24.760 --> 59:25.760\nDo you know what I mean?\n\n59:25.760 --> 59:26.760\nLike I find that shit interesting.\n\n59:26.760 --> 59:27.760\nDo you know what I'm saying?\n\n59:27.760 --> 59:30.120\nSo if there's a dude who has a totally different political view to me and there's a comedian\n\n59:30.120 --> 59:33.960\nout there who has that view, like say it, you know, as long as it's funny and, you know,\n\n59:33.960 --> 59:37.360\nsay it, like that's, that's your freedom to do it, you know, like I, I believe in freedom\n\n59:37.360 --> 59:38.360\nin comedy.\n\n59:38.360 --> 59:43.360\nSo like me personally, I don't think I'm morally obligated that like, oh, these things are happening.\n\n59:43.360 --> 59:46.360\nAnd I must put on my black turtleneck and smoke a cigarette.\n\n59:46.360 --> 59:48.360\nAnd so I say, what's wrong with the world, man?\n\n59:48.360 --> 59:49.360\nLike, I don't know.\n\n59:49.360 --> 59:50.360\nI'm a comedian.\n\n59:50.360 --> 59:54.240\nIt's a weird area because some, some comics have the philosophy that I do understand,\n\n59:54.240 --> 59:59.720\nwhich is that comedy is its own political party where we're like, we're supposed to\n\n59:59.720 --> 01:00:04.560\nbe funny above and beyond anything else and anything that impedes in humor is like that's\n\n01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.560\nfucking Satan.\n\n01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.560\nYou should do it.\n\n01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:11.880\nLike, I think if you have the, the, the opinion and the intelligence and the, and the, and\n\n01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.560\nthe point of view and funny, then put it out there.\n\n01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.560\nDo you know what I mean?\n\n01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.560\nI think that's great.\n\n01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.560\nAnd I'm going to hear it.\n\n01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.560\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.320\nBut at the same time, I don't think, I think, I think there's also, I don't think every\n\n01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.640\ncomedian should now be Bill Hicks.\n\n01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:24.480\nI think, I think if someone does one line, it's kind of, you know, when you're one line,\n\n01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.480\nyou know what I'm saying?\n\n01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.480\nI don't think.\n\n01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.480\nWell, you definitely have to be, yeah, you have to be honest.\n\n01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.480\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.760\nLike, like, so there's, there probably are comics out there that are probably regrettably\n\n01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:38.840\nbeing like, you know what, I'm, I, I have this opinion and that opinion, like, but everyone's\n\n01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840\njust going to boo me.\n\n01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.120\nYou know, and that person probably, you're, you're like, you, you and I wouldn't want\n\n01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:48.480\nthat person to pre-sensor themselves, but we would want them to try to figure out it\n\n01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.480\nto be funny.\n\n01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.480\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.480\nDo you have a question?\n\n01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:55.560\nYou see, like, if I'm not over here, is there, is it, is it, is it harder to talk about Trump\n\n01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.200\nthan it was to talk about Bush?\n\n01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.000\nUh, well, if you talked about Bush, this is my perception.\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.040\nCould it both, like, quiet?\n\n01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.280\nIf you talked about Bush, now, but there's a million variables here.\n\n01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.920\nBut if you, in my perception, if you talked about Bush, you were being, you're bringing\n\n01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:15.160\npolitics into your comedy and it, it, it was like needless.\n\n01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.160\nBut maybe, maybe.\n\n01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.240\nWell, like, there was a band called the Dixie Chicks, uh, there still is probably, uh, and\n\n01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:25.760\nthey were, they're, they're, uh, they're liberal-ish and they were performing in Texas, I think,\n\n01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.280\nand they said that he's not my president, we're not proud of the president, and they\n\n01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.840\ngot all sorts of shit.\n\n01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:34.080\nIf you, if you go on stage now and don't talk shit about Trump, like, that, that, like,\n\n01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.080\nthe show wasn't a good show.\n\n01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.080\nLike, like, you, you're required to get up and talk shit about this guy.\n\n01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.240\nIt was something really funny and ironic about that, that it was braver to be political when\n\n01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:47.800\nwe were talking about, you know, like, when politics meant a little more boring because\n\n01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:52.240\nwe had things managed and then there'd be like, drone strike here or an invasion there\n\n01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.400\nand we, it was all manageable through Ted Koppel and all this stuff.\n\n01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.160\nSo, so if you were a rock band and you came out and said, we're going to do some stuff\n\n01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.760\nfrom our new album, but also I want to talk about dangling chads.\n\n01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.360\nThere might be like a bunch of booze, you know, they're, they're, they're, they're like\n\n01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:11.360\nbooze from people going like, fuck you, Leonard Skinner, I wanted to, I just wanted to, I\n\n01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:16.920\nwas making up bands and relationships, but, but, but the, um, that's, I guess that's kind\n\n01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:21.840\nof my question, which probably a 26-year-old, uh, maybe doesn't even have the answer to,\n\n01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:27.320\nwhich is like, how different is it now and how does that difference equate to an obligation?\n\n01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:32.720\nBecause sometimes I sit in my five bedroom house in Los Feliz and I go, nothing has changed\n\n01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.880\nfor me.\n\n01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:38.320\nSo why would my, uh, material change?\n\n01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:43.560\nAnd then I go, you were talking about how you don't wash your ass, like you need to\n\n01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.360\nkeep talking about what you're thinking.\n\n01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.080\nYou just said that, like talking about Bush was less important.\n\n01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.080\nIt's all subjective.\n\n01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.320\nIt's less important to me.\n\n01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.440\nSo that's part of what it is, is that I feel like, I kind of like, I feel, it's a little\n\n01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:01.080\nbit of like a, what do you call it, a, uh, an atonement, a, uh, confession, uh, when,\n\n01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:08.280\nwhen, when it's, uh, uh, making up for, like, like, I, like, I, uh, amendments.\n\n01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.280\nYeah.\n\n01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.280\nBut wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.280\nPenance, she said.\n\n01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.280\nPenance, but amendments also.\n\n01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:18.280\nDo you think it's, but do you think if people, but my word also, that rhymed with your word.\n\n01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:22.360\nWell, but do you think, do you think that if people start talking about Trump, right?\n\n01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.840\nAnd it's sort of the thing of like, all right, we all got to talk about Trump.\n\n01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.560\nDo you think then it becomes like a fad and like people just start doing it for the sake\n\n01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.560\nof doing it.\n\n01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:30.560\nAnd then it kind of loses it.\n\n01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.560\nSure.\n\n01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.560\nWhen you see.\n\n01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.560\nBut I think, yeah, I think that's the danger with all.\n\n01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.560\nYeah.\n\n01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.880\nThat danger always looms with every, any issue that everyone's talking about is that I think\n\n01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:44.040\npeople who are like, it's, it's, it's so, so hard to unbraid from like, if I were to,\n\n01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:50.320\nif I were to say, hey, Trump's a piece of shit, and let's say I get three people booing.\n\n01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:55.080\nOne person might be booing because they're like, your comedy's lazy.\n\n01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.720\nAnother person might be booing because they're like, I voted for him and I want to forget\n\n01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.120\nabout it.\n\n01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:03.680\nI was wrong and I came out to drown my sorrows and laughter.\n\n01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:07.000\nStop reminding me I'm an idiot.\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.960\nAnd then a third person might be a ghost.\n\n01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:18.160\nWho's trying to give me a treasure map, and I don't know, it's, it's, it's, it's sort\n\n01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:23.000\nof like, it's making me very curious because it's not like I'm like haunting the stand-up\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nclubs these days.\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.520\nI'm, I'm kind of like, I'm, I'm vastly approaching the threshold where it's like, like, according\n\n01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.320\nto my predecessors, the baby boomers, it's like, I'm getting to an age where I can kind\n\n01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.520\nof clock out and be like, ah, world's a mess.\n\n01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.520\nGive me some ice cream.\n\n01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:43.840\nYou know, funny enough, like a lot of people I know kind of don't even really do the Brexit\n\n01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.840\nthing anymore.\n\n01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:48.400\nBecause I think a lot of them feel it's been like played out a lot of them.\n\n01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.600\nOh, that's the third boo.\n\n01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:54.760\nThe third boo is the person like, like, like my audience might, like a lot of us are like,\n\n01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:59.800\nI, I, please, like, I watched John Oliver, I watched, I watched, I watched, I watched my\n\n01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.500\nTwitter feed, like, like, like, like, just keep talking about how you jerked off of the\n\n01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:06.480\nsharpie in your butt once, like, like, you know, like, like, like, like, you don't have\n\n01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.840\nanything new to say about it, but yeah, continue.\n\n01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.760\nNo, no, no, no, no, you've pretty much summed up, man, that's it.\n\n01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.160\nI mean, I'm done.\n\n01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.160\nNo.\n\n01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:19.040\nYeah, like, you know, it's such, it's such, it's just, I've never, and like, and you know,\n\n01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.960\nI've not been in comedy for that many years, but I can't, you know, remember a time where\n\n01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.960\nit's been like this.\n\n01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:24.960\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.760\nLike, this is, this is, this is a weird fucking time, and it's hard navigating as a human\n\n01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.920\nbeing and navigating as a comedian, you know what I'm saying, and sort of what, what my\n\n01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:38.720\narts got to reflect, you know, and, you know, as what I do see a lot of is, and I don't\n\n01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:43.240\nknow if this is right, but, you know, I think there's some great comedians who do it, and\n\n01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:48.600\nI've sort of done it sometimes myself is people kind of see what the issue was of why maybe\n\n01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:53.520\nTrump got elected or why Brexit happened and attack that, and not necessarily attack the\n\n01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:59.000\nthing or the voters or the, the, you know, the image of what, you know, Trump as this\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.040\nis that one dude, you know, they're trying to attack the things of why that happened,\n\n01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.840\nyou know, because there's so many reasons of why that this is happening, you know, and\n\n01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:10.720\nit's, and I think, I think some of it lies on economics and all of that stuff that I'm\n\n01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:15.200\nnot intelligent enough to understand, but I think it also lies in social shit, you know,\n\n01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:20.400\nI think, I think, you know, we, we spent a long time of telling people to, to, to shut\n\n01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.760\nup if we don't agree with them.\n\n01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.360\nI think that's happened for a little while now, but being honest, there's-\n\n01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:27.640\nIt's crazy how the internet is what actually has made that the most possible.\n\n01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:28.640\nYeah.\n\n01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.760\nI mean, I well thought, if you told me, if a Martian came down and pitched the technology\n\n01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:34.720\nto me and said, everyone will be connected, I'd be like, oh, so there will be a little\n\n01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.720\nless binary thing.\n\n01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:38.720\nYeah.\n\n01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:39.720\nNo.\n\n01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.720\nThis act, it's crazy.\n\n01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.040\nIt's, it's, it's like, like, we are obsessed now with firing this person, get rid of that\n\n01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.040\nprayer.\n\n01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.040\nLike, we, we, we really-\n\n01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.040\nWords hurt.\n\n01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.040\nYeah.\n\n01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.120\nThe thing is that we live in this weird spectrum where it's like, it's like, it's like, it's\n\n01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.840\nlike, you know, you've got to, you've got one side of just like, say nothing, words hurt.\n\n01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.840\nRight.\n\n01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.840\nIt's like, why can't I say nigger?\n\n01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.560\nAnd it's like, why can't there be a middle ground though?\n\n01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:01.560\nLike, you know what I'm saying?\n\n01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.560\nLike, why can't we-\n\n01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.560\nLook, say nothing.\n\n01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.560\nWords hurt.\n\n01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.560\nI'm just saying the words.\n\n01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.560\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:07.560\nThat's the problem.\n\n01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:12.560\nAlso, in England, that word means diaper.\n\n01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.560\nIt's just a, it's a form of marble.\n\n01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:16.560\nYeah.\n\n01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.560\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.560\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:19.560\nThat as well.\n\n01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.560\nYeah.\n\n01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.320\nBut yeah, that, that, it's the, it's this, we, we, we, we were having all these debates\n\n01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:27.000\nabout like what you can say, what you can't say, and all it's like, that, that was the\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.240\nother thing about that documentary that I, that you have to watch.\n\n01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.240\nIt's 9-11.\n\n01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:36.840\nWas that, was that an accusation or something?\n\n01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:42.880\nHe has a lot of stand-up bits driven by how he, he looks a little bit like Osama bin\n\n01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880\nLaden.\n\n01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.880\nYeah.\n\n01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.560\nBut we, we probably should have, I probably should have done that concept rather than\n\n01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.680\na cool guy to sing that no one's ever seen.\n\n01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:58.800\nBut yeah, I don't know, I was, I, I, it's, it's, god damn it, it's, it's fucking, it's\n\n01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.920\nsomething that nobody could have predicted is the fact that we would actually connect\n\n01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:07.080\nto each other telepathically and that that would actually usher in an age of, of like\n\n01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:12.200\na really kind of weird like pre-Columbus suspicion of the other.\n\n01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:18.480\nLike it's, it's almost, it's like, it, it, we're, we're, I feel it in my own bones.\n\n01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:25.720\nLike I, I'm a really bright open minded guy that grew up on the internet, but we now just\n\n01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:35.320\nlike, we've, I feel like I have been indoctrinated into scanning information on screens through\n\n01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:40.840\na, a, a, a chip of, is this person an enemy or an ally?\n\n01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:47.480\nAnd if so, and then the flow chart proceeds from there, which is so dangerous and, and\n\n01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:54.160\nso profits only the worst of the bad guys probably some level of coexisting, I guess\n\n01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.160\nthat.\n\n01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.240\nI mean, because, because that's the thing is that in that documentary, there's these\n\n01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:03.960\nyoung black activists who are sitting across from this guy and one, and, and, and he says,\n\n01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.520\ndo you think these people can change?\n\n01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.440\nDo you think a white racist can change?\n\n01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.640\nAnd one of the guys kind of reflexively goes like, no.\n\n01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.040\nAnd they're like, whole fuck, because that's how we all feel about the enemy.\n\n01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:18.920\nDon't approach them as if they're people that can change because like liberals in America\n\n01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:24.040\nare like, I'm fucking so sick of this goddamn fucking suck in the dick of these fucking like,\n\n01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:28.000\nlike the, what are the fuck people you told me I forgot and Trump's my punishment for\n\n01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nforgetting them?\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nOoh, can I listen to you some more?\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.440\nWell, they abuse us and go like, ooh, snowflake, that feeling's meekie boo boo.\n\n01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:35.440\nYou won.\n\n01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:36.440\nFuck you.\n\n01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.440\nI'm the troll now.\n\n01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.440\nYou Nazi pick.\n\n01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.440\nAll right.\n\n01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.440\nAll right.\n\n01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:43.520\nBut yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's heightened times.\n\n01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:51.040\nWe are in more danger of a, we revert to fight or flight or really fight and to fight.\n\n01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.520\nLike we have nowhere to go.\n\n01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:56.840\nBut so I asked you a question and then I answered it.\n\n01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.840\nYeah.\n\n01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.840\nGreat budget.\n\n01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.840\nI mean, you asked the question and you answered it way more articulate and I will work.\n\n01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.840\nI'll probably do one word on that.\n\n01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.840\nI don't know.\n\n01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:05.840\nI'm upset.\n\n01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:09.040\nI feel like, is this, is this interesting for you guys?\n\n01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.040\nSeriously.\n\n01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.040\nYou are great audience.\n\n01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.600\nI could, usually they go like, it's 9-eleven and then like sometimes when there's like\n\n01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.800\na thoughtful guest, they're like, it's, it's 9-eleven.\n\n01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.800\nThey're, they're, they're, they're mostly engrossed.\n\n01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:20.800\nIt's weird.\n\n01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.960\nI got, you know, I don't want to be thrown in this spectrum now of faultfulness.\n\n01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.400\nYou know, like I still, I still, you know, because it's, because I, what you said, the\n\n01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.040\nworld was like, what do you think your role is?\n\n01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:31.680\nLike I still want to talk about, you know, like weird places I've come.\n\n01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.200\nLike I still want to, you know, I still want to, you know, talk about.\n\n01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.200\nWell, I have a great idea.\n\n01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.200\nWhy don't you come back?\n\n01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.680\nYou're here for a while working on your ratio.\n\n01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:38.680\nYou should come back.\n\n01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.680\nYeah.\n\n01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.680\nI'm going to talk about all kinds of stuff.\n\n01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.680\nLet's hear it for Jamali Maddox coming out here.\n\n01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:45.680\nJamali Maddox.\n\n01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:56.760\nWatch his show, Hate Thy Neighbor.\n\n01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.520\nWe really have to promote that show or we violate his visa.\n\n01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.520\nYou have to watch Hate Thy Neighbor.\n\n01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.520\nYeah.\n\n01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.520\nIt sounds awesome.\n\n01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.520\nHate Thy Neighbor.\n\n01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.520\nIt's a great title.\n\n01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.520\nThe visa thing is really complicated.\n\n01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.440\nYou ever talked to a, a, a UK person that comes over here.\n\n01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.760\nLike, I remember when John Oliver would come over to do community, it was like so fucking\n\n01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:11.760\ncomplicated.\n\n01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.760\nIt's weird.\n\n01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.760\nIt's weird.\n\n01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.760\nWho can get, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, who gets citizenship?\n\n01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.760\nYeah.\n\n01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:22.080\nBecause the last time people just left England, they started, they started another country\n\n01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.560\nand told them to go, fuck off.\n\n01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.160\nThey've been, they've been hurt before.\n\n01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:30.600\nI had Ludwig Gorinsson who did all the scorer for communities, Swedish, Swedish, am I going\n\n01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.600\nto offend him?\n\n01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:32.600\nIs that where he's from?\n\n01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.600\nSwedish.\n\n01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:40.560\nAnd I had to keep, I had to, like, sign a thing that, that verified that he was a genius\n\n01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.000\nbecause he was in a genius visa because he was like a visa that said, like, like, he's\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.360\nnot stealing a jarb, you know, like, like, like, you can't find a composer like this\n\n01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:50.360\nin the States.\n\n01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:52.360\nYou know, you have to, like, sign a letter.\n\n01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:57.200\nThis guy remakes music that I can't believe.\n\n01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.200\nThat's how we got Spencer.\n\n01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.200\nYeah.\n\n01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.200\nExactly.\n\n01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.760\nSpencer's here in a dungeon master visa.\n\n01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:04.760\nYeah.\n\n01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:09.120\nI was going to say a genius bar because he worked at the Apple store.\n\n01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.120\nOkay.\n\n01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:18.200\nSo, let's, let's, let's get Levy up here, shall we, Steve Levy, you in the house?\n\n01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:26.840\nHi, everybody, what's going on?\n\n01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:27.840\nHow'd you think that went, Steve?\n\n01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:28.840\nI thought it went great.\n\n01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.840\nIt went great.\n\n01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.840\nYeah, I really like him.\n\n01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:32.840\nYeah.\n\n01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:33.840\nWe, we, like, hit it off as soon as he, as soon as we met.\n\n01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.840\nI know.\n\n01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:35.840\nI'm glad I set that meeting.\n\n01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:36.840\nYeah.\n\n01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:37.840\nOh, you did.\n\n01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:38.840\nThat was me?\n\n01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:39.840\nOkay.\n\n01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:46.040\nWell, maybe I don't like him.\n\n01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.040\nToo late.\n\n01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:51.240\nI control my fate is what I'm saying, like, all right.\n\n01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.240\nWhat's going down?\n\n01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.360\nI'm going to start exercising.\n\n01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.360\nStart exercising.\n\n01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.360\nGet back on the trip.\n\n01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.360\nI'm going to.\n\n01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.360\nI'm going to.\n\n01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:00.880\nI, I saw myself from the side.\n\n01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:02.520\nI saw, I saw it.\n\n01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.520\nWhich video?\n\n01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.520\nDon't do that.\n\n01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:08.960\nThe Ryan Elder, this guy just music for Rick and Morty, there's a shot of me talking on\n\n01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:17.480\nthe phone from the side sitting and I am a, just a ball of, and that's, if, if you are,\n\n01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.480\nyou're fine.\n\n01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:24.720\nDon't think about, oh, I have to, like, if you're happy, like, like fucking, you're perfect.\n\n01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:31.840\nLike, I have an issue and I'm old and I need to, like, it's about cholesterol for me.\n\n01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.960\nIt's not about how I look.\n\n01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:35.040\nI have a fucking perfect life.\n\n01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:41.640\nIf I, if I, if I thought I could live for a thousand years, I wouldn't do anything physically.\n\n01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.640\nIt's that I'm worried about.\n\n01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:47.120\nI don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to make it to 69.\n\n01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.120\nI believe you.\n\n01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.120\nYes.\n\n01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.120\nNot for the bit.\n\n01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.120\nOh.\n\n01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:58.120\nI can see that roughly people, men who, in America, who have achieved a little bit, like,\n\n01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:01.000\nthey're tending to drop off at 69.\n\n01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000\nNice.\n\n01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:09.080\nLike, it's, it's, it's, and then it's like, yeah, I don't want to live to 80 if it means\n\n01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.440\nI never did acid.\n\n01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:11.520\nI did lots of acid.\n\n01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.560\nI can take 69.\n\n01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.720\nHow much acid?\n\n01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.720\nWhat kills you at 69?\n\n01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.720\nI don't know.\n\n01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.720\nNo.\n\n01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.840\nI did acid, let's say, eight times in my life.\n\n01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.040\nDid it, did it change your life?\n\n01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:30.320\nI had a friend who, he did acid and he was a different person after that experience.\n\n01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.800\nIn a good way or a bad way?\n\n01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.320\nIn the best way, yeah.\n\n01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.320\nOh really?\n\n01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:35.320\nYeah.\n\n01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.560\nHe, he joined the, my buddy, Rangers.\n\n01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.560\nHis name is Matthew.\n\n01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.560\nMy friend, finally.\n\n01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:40.560\nNo, no.\n\n01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.840\nHe's like, I got to get out, I got a country to serve and he like left.\n\n01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:48.720\nMy friend, Jeremy, he, he grew up in a house.\n\n01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:55.240\nHe had two chiropractors and his mom wouldn't let him take any like prescription.\n\n01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.240\nWait, I'm sorry.\n\n01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.640\nDid you say he lived between two chiropractors?\n\n01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.760\nNo, no.\n\n01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.400\nHis parents are two chiro, whatever.\n\n01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:04.800\nOkay, I got, I got, yeah, I don't know.\n\n01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.240\nHe wasn't allowed to take prescription medication, so he always lived in fear and we lived in\n\n01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:13.120\na bubble town and he always thought he was going to get sick and, and die and we went\n\n01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:20.000\nto college and there was a day where he did acid with a couple friends of mine and like\n\n01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nthe world opened up to him.\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.720\nHe started asking questions about like society and religion and like the education system\n\n01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:30.840\nand just things he never thought about and, you know.\n\n01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:35.080\nI mean, you see a lot of talk on intervention about, well, you know, pots or gateway and\n\n01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:40.400\nall this stuff, but I'm like, you know, I will say that I don't want any lawsuits because\n\n01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.680\nI'm talking to anyone 20 and over.\n\n01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:50.320\nI'm like, acid is a, it's a decent truck stop to stop at, like, just to check out before\n\n01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:56.160\nyou turn 30 because after 30, you're, you, you're going to be like, you're going to\n\n01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:01.280\ntake acid and you're going to be like, I haven't done my taxes.\n\n01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:04.800\nWhy am I doing acid if I didn't do my taxes?\n\n01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.040\nBut when you're 23, like, like, like I, I'm only speaking from my experience.\n\n01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.720\nIt was just like, I, I'm the biggest, the word pussy's not really, I'm trying to out\n\n01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:21.440\nmode that, but like, I was the biggest pussy in the world about, about, about like, like\n\n01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:27.680\ndrugs and stuff, but, but, but, but when I was in my 20s, I was like, what, what, what,\n\n01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:36.000\nhow might this kill me and as a result, plus being lucky, I, I, I, I did acid and mushrooms\n\n01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:45.760\nand stuff like that and I do think they, they give mushrooms to PTSD people, like PTSD people.\n\n01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:50.200\nIt's like the fucking Fraggle Rock, like there's PTSD people in the corner.\n\n01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.560\nThey're like dozers or whatever.\n\n01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:59.600\nPeople with PTSD, they've, they've clinically, I get all my news from NPR, but yeah, that,\n\n01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:04.520\nthat, that, that Silo Simon, like it, it clinically gives you a sense of perspective that until\n\n01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:09.600\nyou get it, you don't have it and that can actually be incredibly helpful for things\n\n01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.160\nthat we haven't otherwise figured out how to treat.\n\n01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.720\nUh, anyways, explained it to you, explained it to you.\n\n01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.200\nSpencer, did you ever do the, uh, the acids or the mushrooms?\n\n01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.280\nNo, I haven't done my taxes.\n\n01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:26.640\nNo, I was just, what if you do your taxes and then take acid and then it's like, that's\n\n01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.640\nthe best advantage to dream.\n\n01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:28.640\nYou get so high.\n\n01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.640\nYeah.\n\n01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:30.640\nI don't know.\n\n01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:34.320\nYou can act, you can actually fly.\n\n01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.320\nThat's awesome.\n\n01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.320\nIt's the only way to celebrate doing your taxes.\n\n01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:39.560\nThe first time I did it, I did it with our friend Matt Young and a little back house\n\n01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:43.320\nin Echo Park and it was like, it was surrounded by trees and it was really safe and he's like\n\n01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.320\nthe perfect guy.\n\n01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.320\nMushrooms or acid?\n\n01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:46.320\nAcid.\n\n01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.520\nAnd we, he goes, just do a little bit and he walked me through and he's like the most\n\n01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:52.160\nlike caring, nicest guy and we just, we just sat there and listened to music and it went\n\n01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:55.000\noutside and like, like looked at the trees and it was like the greatest.\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000\nIt was really amazing.\n\n01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.080\nI did it, I did it in, uh, well, my friend Sean McKenna, like we were doing Coke and\n\n01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:03.160\nhe gave me a tiny piece of paper to put this under your tongue and then I asked him what\n\n01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:09.800\nit was and he said it was, it was acid and that was my first acid trip, but it turned\n\n01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:10.800\nout okay.\n\n01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:15.120\nAnd then the second time I did it, I just, I remember being with Frito, my high school\n\n01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:18.960\nbuddy, Dave Frito, who you've met on the show maybe, and we were in Milwaukee and we were\n\n01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:29.240\nlike, we're on acid in my house in Milwaukee and I rented a house and I remember like ending\n\n01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:35.560\nthe night with like, just at the stack of newspapers and we were going through the Family\n\n01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:40.600\nCircus, uh, comics on acid, it was fucking fantastic.\n\n01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:41.600\nThat's good.\n\n01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:48.720\nIt was like, what do you mean, why, why do you, why does it matter if Billy spilt these\n\n01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.720\ncookies or not?\n\n01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:53.840\nLike, I don't know, it's just kind of like blows your mind and then, and then Price's\n\n01:18:53.840 --> 01:19:00.760\nRight comes out and you're like, what, Price's Right is the most important drug experience\n\n01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:04.360\nthat any young American can have.\n\n01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:11.600\nWhen Drew first got it, I went on his advice, he's like, go a little high, go to the audience\n\n01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.600\nand watch it high.\n\n01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:19.640\nI went to, I went to a Price's Right taping so high, my mom knew I was high from watching\n\n01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:29.560\nthe Price's Right because I was in the audience right between two bidders, that's like that\n\n01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:36.160\nhigh, but I'm probably a standard deaf TV because this is my mom in the early 2000s.\n\n01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:41.040\nBut you were amazing because she could still see how red my eyes were and how amazed I\n\n01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.880\nwas at the savings.\n\n01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:47.240\nI was sitting right next to you.\n\n01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:51.240\nI was sitting with you and you were kind of being like, I don't know if it was weed paranoia\n\n01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:56.720\nor social anxiety, but on the way, you looked a little tense, you weren't like, you didn't\n\n01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:57.720\nseem totally comfortable.\n\n01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:58.720\nYeah, it was very high.\n\n01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:03.720\nAnd then when people were yelling out, I'm like, yeah, you know how much this thing costs.\n\n01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:07.600\nAnd he's like, I don't know, I'm like, I don't know, I'm yelling, I'm like, I'm like,\n\n01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:08.600\nyou can get in there.\n\n01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:13.480\nAlso, I think I told you mistakenly, the reason why they sit the guests of Drew or whoever\n\n01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:17.200\nright behind the bidder's row is because it's actually not a great place to be seen on camera.\n\n01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.760\nYou must have been right in the hole between.\n\n01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:24.960\nNo, I was after my mom showed me, she put it on DVD, I was like, whoops, I looked like\n\n01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:29.720\na Jim Brewer character, but I looked like the Jim Brewer character.\n\n01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:33.680\nBut at one point, Dan got swept into it and I think they were bidding on the on the on\n\n01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:37.000\nthe Plinko chips and they didn't know how much this costs or how much that costs.\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.440\nAnd Dan was like, it's the kitty litter, it's the kitty litter, it's the kitty litter,\n\n01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:41.440\nit's cheaper.\n\n01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:47.840\nI tell her, it's the kitty litter, the kitty litter, you started yelling at the kitty litter\n\n01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.560\nand then she won it and you were so happy, it was really great.\n\n01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:52.920\nIt was really, really good.\n\n01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:57.200\nIt is like, especially through the lens of like now after the elections and stuff and\n\n01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:01.000\nnow the world that we can see that could happen, like, whereas before it might have been like,\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.240\nyou're a tool of the state if you're saying it's fun to sit and get high and watch prices\n\n01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:07.200\nright, but like, unless you're laughing at the capitalism.\n\n01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:11.360\nBut now I look back and I go, no, that was a wonderful guppy tank for capitalists.\n\n01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:16.440\nIt was like, you could be 20 and get high and pretend shop for the same shit.\n\n01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.200\nLike, when you're, when you're that age, you're like, you're, you're about to go to\n\n01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.680\nTarget and, and comparison shop plungers and stuff.\n\n01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:27.920\nYou're going to buy your first plunger and start thinking about what, oh, this plunger\n\n01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:31.440\nis cheaper, but I might need more later.\n\n01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:35.560\nAnd it's kind of exciting the, the, the, the anyways, but I went there high as a, as a\n\n01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.560\ngrown man.\n\n01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:41.880\nAnd he's like, when that fucking yodeling dude came out and it was like, oh man, when\n\n01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:46.080\nHans comes out, as I told you, cause I said, like, we don't know what's going to happen\n\n01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.960\nbecause you don't know what the games are going to be.\n\n01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:50.800\nBut I was like, we're praying that, that Cliffhanger comes out.\n\n01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:51.800\nIs it Cliffhangers?\n\n01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:52.800\nCliffhanger.\n\n01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.800\nYeah.\n\n01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.120\nAnd when, when he came out, you and I, I think we, we embraced.\n\n01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:01.280\nThat is some fucking, that was designed by like an SS officer that was trying to exploit\n\n01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:08.080\nTHC influence or something, I was like, I said Alpine climber and I'll design the yodels\n\n01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:13.320\nand like, it was, it's all designed to like freak you out if you're high, but if you're\n\n01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:18.240\nwatching a TV and it's like, cause Bob Barker would go, let's, well, you thought this, let's\n\n01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:26.800\ntake a look and there'd be a pause and then this fucking puppet would go, for no reason.\n\n01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.200\nThere was never any reason for any of the conceits.\n\n01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:34.040\nIt would, he'd just be like, let's go to moon of savings and it would only be guessing\n\n01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.040\nprices of shit, but there'd be craters.\n\n01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.040\nFucking genius.\n\n01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:43.200\nBut the one that we went to, she like got the first two like really short, like Hans didn't\n\n01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.200\ndo fucking anything.\n\n01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:48.000\nHe was still at base camp and then the second one went a little bit longer and she missed\n\n01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nby a lot.\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.640\nBut like stopped about half way up, she's got, Hans had half the mountain to go with\n\n01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:58.680\nthe final thing and she bid and it wasn't like the crowd kind of went, ooh, I don't\n\n01:22:58.680 --> 01:22:59.680\nknow about that.\n\n01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:03.680\nAnd I was like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.\n\n01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:06.000\nAnd you and I were just freaking out.\n\n01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:14.080\nAnd he went right to the fucking last one and stopped on the very edge and it was bedlam.\n\n01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:17.960\nIt was, it's so loud in there, cause I got to host that for a little while, I announced\n\n01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.560\nit like to come on down shit and like, you go home with nightmares in your head cause\n\n01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:28.920\nit's, it's, it's like, it's like the noise of a Beatles concert, but about kitty littering\n\n01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:29.920\npleasures.\n\n01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:33.640\nThe most fucked up thing about going to a Price is Right taping, the most fundamentally\n\n01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:40.560\nfucked up thing is that you're sitting in chairs and your angle of view is so different\n\n01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:41.560\nfrom the cameras.\n\n01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:47.440\nYou, you have to go like this to remind yourself that there's that linoleum with the 70s flowers\n\n01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.440\non it.\n\n01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:53.160\nLike it's like, it's above your line of sight and the whole, it's like, that's, that's\n\n01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:56.840\nif only if you're sitting in the first couple rows, like the stage is like, yeah, humble\n\n01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:57.840\nbrag.\n\n01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:58.840\nAll right.\n\n01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:07.040\nWell, speaking of getting really high Spencer, you want to play some, some D&D right now?\n\n01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:12.280\nAnd can you have some, can you have some recap lenience and because we, we haven't say, say\n\n01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.280\nthat again.\n\n01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:20.640\nCan you have some recap lenience because we, I don't remember anything.\n\n01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:21.640\nJeff and I re-listened.\n\n01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:22.640\nYeah.\n\n01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.280\nThis is going to be the strictest recap all year.\n\n01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.280\nYeah.\n\n01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:30.680\nWe, we didn't do a whole lot, but it took us eight hours to do it.\n\n01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:32.280\nSo it's, it's, it's going to be a pretty easy.\n\n01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:33.280\nOkay.\n\n01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.280\nRight.\n\n01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:35.280\nI got it.\n\n01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:40.160\nYou're going to have to drop and give me 30 while I do it because I'm being strict,\n\n01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:43.680\nwhich is a quality of recaps.\n\n01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:45.680\nAll right.\n\n01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:53.840\nLast time they met doctor, no, not a doctor, farmer, Manille and a diarrhea junior ingratiated\n\n01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:59.160\nhim with some carefully timed snacks with Manille on their side.\n\n01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:06.560\nThey spent a good 25 minutes haggling over the price of cow carcasses and then eventually\n\n01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:13.920\nsettled on, I think too gold a piece, I don't know, it was a bad deal, but it was good for\n\n01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.880\nthe farmer.\n\n01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:21.680\nYou guys, you made a costume of the cows and went out to be bait towards a creature that\n\n01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:26.720\nseemed to be attacking at the cows and eating them or killing them.\n\n01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:32.080\nAnd then it came and, and you guys made a noise, I think and scared it off.\n\n01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:34.800\nI jumped and yelled.\n\n01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:38.160\nIt was going off away towards a church and we were towards the church.\n\n01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:41.040\nWe were in hot pursuit of this robed flying figure.\n\n01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.040\nHot pursuit.\n\n01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.040\nNow.\n\n01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.040\nOkay.\n\n01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.040\nAll right.\n\n01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.720\nSo I'll go ahead.\n\n01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.720\nIt's evening time.\n\n01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.840\nYou're headed, you're, I mean, you're, you're facing the direction that the creature kind\n\n01:25:54.840 --> 01:26:01.200\nof took off in, which is again towards, towards the priory, the church.\n\n01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.760\nAnd yeah, it, it, it didn't make too much noise or anything.\n\n01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.480\nYou basically only heard it's footsteps.\n\n01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:12.160\nSo we know the direction it went, we're running after it, where we can still kind of see it,\n\n01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:13.160\neven though it's dark out.\n\n01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:17.960\nAnd I, I say we run as fast as we can and not slow ourselves down by dwelling on the\n\n01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:25.440\nfact that you kind of, he was like 30 feet away from when you sprung your attack.\n\n01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.360\nI won't, I won't explain my reasoning until later.\n\n01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:29.360\nOkay.\n\n01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:30.360\nOkay.\n\n01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.360\nThat's fine.\n\n01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.360\nYeah.\n\n01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.880\nTold, told you to wait, told you to wait for it.\n\n01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.960\nI just had that feeling.\n\n01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:38.960\nI just felt like we were going to wait and wait and wait.\n\n01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.520\nAnd then it was going to go away.\n\n01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:44.320\nAnd then Spencer would be like, what do you think happens if you wait that long?\n\n01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:47.080\nAnd that's the thing is that that's the same thought I had that caused us to end up burning\n\n01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.560\ndown the poor family's house.\n\n01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.320\nLike I, it's called metagaming.\n\n01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.320\nRight.\n\n01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:56.440\nI'm not even trying to punish it, but I'm doing what I do in real life.\n\n01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:02.280\nBut the good news is even though it took us all day and some of the night to get practice\n\n01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:06.760\nand looking like cows, we did find a flying robed figure.\n\n01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:08.240\nSo that's a lead.\n\n01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:11.440\nSo let's, let's, let's, let's, let's asses and elbows towards that figure.\n\n01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:14.840\nWe had that whole conversation like Hannah Barbera style.\n\n01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:18.040\nBackgrounds are the same.\n\n01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.480\nJust keep passing the same burning door.\n\n01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:21.640\nAll right.\n\n01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:23.480\nYou make it back to the priory.\n\n01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:25.320\nIt's that old stone building.\n\n01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.320\nIt's pretty old.\n\n01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:29.440\nOnce again, you see, it seems to be boarded up.\n\n01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:34.320\nIt seems that it's more reinforced than it was before and sitting outside is a Patchens\n\n01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:35.320\nagain.\n\n01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:36.320\nHe's sleeping.\n\n01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.320\nIt looks like patches.\n\n01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.320\nYeah.\n\n01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:39.320\nHe was the first guy.\n\n01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:42.880\nThat's the kind of kind of weird faced dude that we met before.\n\n01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:48.760\nPatchens was a young church boy who is guarding the front exit when he was, that's not the\n\n01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:52.320\none that Carlos threw the water on, right?\n\n01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.960\nNo, that was the prior.\n\n01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:59.280\nThat's the episode that we did in a tent at Chris Hardwick's cult.\n\n01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.480\nThe best one.\n\n01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:03.080\nThat was a crazy place, huh?\n\n01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.080\nIt was.\n\n01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:05.080\nWhatever.\n\n01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:06.080\nAll right.\n\n01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.280\nSo are we at Patchens right now?\n\n01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:10.280\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:12.640\nI mean, let's say you're in the clearing outside of the church.\n\n01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:15.560\nI'll put you at 20 feet off, but he's asleep in a chair.\n\n01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.640\nBut we lost sight of the creature.\n\n01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:18.640\nYeah.\n\n01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.400\nIt took, it was really fast.\n\n01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:24.840\nLike you were running in the direction it went, but it disappeared pretty quick.\n\n01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:26.800\nBut in the direction of the priory.\n\n01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.800\nRight.\n\n01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:30.160\nThe only buildings in that direction in town.\n\n01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:31.160\nYeah.\n\n01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:32.160\nOkay.\n\n01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:34.280\nI go up and I rouse Patchens out of his sleep.\n\n01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:35.280\nAll right.\n\n01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.280\nYou do that.\n\n01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:37.280\nHe wakes up.\n\n01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.280\nHey, what's up?\n\n01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:39.280\nYou guys.\n\n01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.280\nHey.\n\n01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:43.720\nWe're in hot pursuit of a robed flying figure.\n\n01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:46.560\nWe have reason to believe he's entered the priory.\n\n01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:47.560\nSo we need access.\n\n01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:48.560\nWe need to get in.\n\n01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:49.680\nI can't get in right now.\n\n01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:55.720\nThey wanted me to guard this place and they kind of just boarded it up inside with me outside.\n\n01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:00.800\nWhen they told you to guard it, what did they tell you to do if anyone attacked the place\n\n01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.200\nor if you had to give them any news of an impending attack?\n\n01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.760\nJust not to let anyone in that we were under attack.\n\n01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:11.560\nSo they sentenced you to death, really?\n\n01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:14.680\nI feel like I should be understanding what you're saying, but I don't.\n\n01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.600\nWe're saying if an attack happens, can you get in yourself?\n\n01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:18.600\nNo, no.\n\n01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:19.600\nWait.\n\n01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.600\nNo.\n\n01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.560\nSo you've been left out here to die?\n\n01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.160\nWell, no, I'm guarding.\n\n01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:28.440\nI mean, in a way, guard duty is always being left out to die somewhere.\n\n01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.480\nNo, that's not true at all.\n\n01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:36.640\nGuard duty usually, by default, would be someone, that person would have egress, ingress.\n\n01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:38.360\nYou could be guarding from the inside.\n\n01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:39.360\nNo, I'm not.\n\n01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:40.880\nI'm not super thrilled about this.\n\n01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:41.880\nI'm on your side.\n\n01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:44.280\nI mean, I'm locked out of the church.\n\n01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:47.840\nWhat is the priors' name again?\n\n01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:48.840\nThat's a great name.\n\n01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:49.840\nBerthold Abernathy.\n\n01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:50.840\nWas that it?\n\n01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:51.840\nUrkel?\n\n01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:52.840\nFather Abernathy.\n\n01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:53.840\nBerthold.\n\n01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:54.840\nFather Urkel Abernathy.\n\n01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:55.840\nOr Berthold.\n\n01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:56.840\nBerthold.\n\n01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.160\nCan I tell you something, Patches?\n\n01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.080\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:07.480\nYour management, which is a lower rung of a church we represent, someone in there is\n\n01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:08.480\nspooky.\n\n01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.480\nYeah, probably.\n\n01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:11.320\nSomething ain't right.\n\n01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:14.640\nAnd we the good guys, I don't mean to get urban on you.\n\n01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:16.040\nAll right.\n\n01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:22.200\nBut I'm saying to you, like, if you were our ally and told us how to get in there to investigate,\n\n01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:30.000\nbecause we just followed a cattle mutilating floating man right to this spot.\n\n01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000\nHe's wearing a robe.\n\n01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.500\nI didn't see that.\n\n01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:33.500\nOf course you didn't see it.\n\n01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:34.500\nYou were sleeping.\n\n01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:35.500\nOh, right.\n\n01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:36.500\nRight.\n\n01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:37.500\nGood point.\n\n01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:38.500\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:39.500\nNo one's cut.\n\n01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.500\nWell, the door's fucked up.\n\n01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:42.000\nI mean, we can break it down.\n\n01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000\nI'll break it down.\n\n01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.320\nNo, there's got to be a quieter way in, Patches.\n\n01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:46.320\nCan we go back?\n\n01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.320\nCan we go back?\n\n01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.840\nYou seem pretty proud of your guard duty status.\n\n01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.240\nYou were asleep when we got here.\n\n01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:55.280\nSo get off your, I'm not, you know, I'm not good at my job.\n\n01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.520\nI'm just trying to help.\n\n01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.520\nOkay.\n\n01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.520\nWell, you know what?\n\n01:30:58.520 --> 01:30:59.520\nYou want to really do something good?\n\n01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.120\nWant to make up for that?\n\n01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:03.440\nWork with the A team over here.\n\n01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:04.960\nWe'll never judge you.\n\n01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.960\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:10.040\nI thought I was already on your side.\n\n01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.960\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:13.960\nWhat do you want?\n\n01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:16.400\nYou know what I like about you, Patches, is you're kind of stealthy.\n\n01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:20.120\nYou were stealthy about your guarding, and you're also, you know, all the quiet ways\n\n01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.120\nto get into the...\n\n01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:24.920\nYeah, that rogue figure probably thought you were just another corpse out in this wasteland.\n\n01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:26.880\nThat was, that was, that was smart of you.\n\n01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.080\nLike, where are the sewers?\n\n01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:35.800\nWhere's the, where are the, the, the, the, the underage girl shoots?\n\n01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:36.800\nHuh.\n\n01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:41.040\nThings you'd expect in an organized religion building.\n\n01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:44.240\nUm, well, we don't have those.\n\n01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.240\nImpressive.\n\n01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:51.920\nUh, we, uh, can you, can you call out to, uh, Father Abernathy?\n\n01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.920\nYeah, yeah, sure.\n\n01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:56.600\nNo, wait, wait, wait.\n\n01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.600\nWe want, we want in, don't we?\n\n01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:01.320\nYeah, but we could, I mean, I would...\n\n01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:02.320\nYou should, you should light the door on fire.\n\n01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.320\nThat's your move.\n\n01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:04.320\nIt's your signature move.\n\n01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:06.320\nFather Abernathy!\n\n01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:08.320\nFather Abernathy!\n\n01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.240\nI say you should light it on fire.\n\n01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.560\nLet's, let's, let's give, let's give him a minute.\n\n01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.680\nIt's a big priory.\n\n01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:15.680\nWhat happens?\n\n01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:18.200\nYou wait, let's say, three minutes or less if you choose to.\n\n01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.200\nOkay.\n\n01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:25.520\nI just think you guys, I think that the odds of it being someone inside the priory, and\n\n01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:31.840\nthe odds therefore of it being a church official are high, making this a, uh, a sensitive mission.\n\n01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:32.840\nA stealth operation.\n\n01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:36.840\nLess of a hack and slash, more of a infiltrate and celebrate.\n\n01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:37.840\nAll right.\n\n01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:38.840\nMakes sense.\n\n01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:48.360\nUh, I, I exempt, I, should we all kind of split up or examine the, the, the church?\n\n01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:51.880\nWell Patch is here, I think is holding out on us in ways to get into the priory.\n\n01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:55.640\nI think there's, I think there's milkshoots, I think there's mail drops, I think there's\n\n01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.640\nchimneys.\n\n01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:57.640\nWell, you need to talk.\n\n01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:59.560\nYeah, I, I would agree.\n\n01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:02.960\nWell, yeah, we could go in the inside.\n\n01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:07.160\nThis, there's, there's multiple buildings that kind of form a perimeter, perimeter around\n\n01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:11.360\nthe inner yard, but then the inner yards, it's got smaller doors.\n\n01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.960\nThey're just kind of people doors.\n\n01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:17.120\nThey're not, they're not so public, you know, they're probably less reinforced.\n\n01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:18.120\nWho knows.\n\n01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:19.600\nLet's do that.\n\n01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:23.000\nPatches, who's the weirdest of your bosses?\n\n01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.680\nLike the one who's been behaving recently, the most strangely, the father, he's been\n\n01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:28.680\nsuper suspicious.\n\n01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:32.440\nI mean, the prior, he's also the father.\n\n01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:33.680\nThere's a lot of redundant church.\n\n01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:37.440\nIs he the father prior to being the prior?\n\n01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.440\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:39.440\nWe'll be right back.\n\n01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.440\nAll right.\n\n01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.440\nWell, that goes both ways.\n\n01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:50.280\nI mean, if you were the father of an infiltrated church, you'd be paranoid, but it also, if\n\n01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:54.320\nyou were a Dracula, you'd be like, does anyone know?\n\n01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:55.320\nRight.\n\n01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:56.320\nAll right.\n\n01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:01.040\nPatches, lead us into the, the perimeter buildings.\n\n01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.040\nAll right.\n\n01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:08.160\nHe takes you around the right side of the building into, there's kind of a narrow, narrow passage\n\n01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:09.160\nway.\n\n01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:14.040\nIt's, it's, let's say it's three feet wide and it's covered in like, what do you call\n\n01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.040\nit?\n\n01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:19.600\nThere's like barrels and all sorts of thing, like, like storage items, boxes that are, that\n\n01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:26.360\nare holding kind of stuff for horses and yard work, but it's all just piled in kind of precariously\n\n01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:30.160\nand then over it is a big iron net that's made out of iron chain links.\n\n01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:36.120\nSo it all looks kind of noisy, but there is, you know, you could go through it, it'll just\n\n01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:40.480\nbe loud or you got to be real careful or something.\n\n01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:44.840\nSo it's like, it's like an attached garage with a lot of loud stuff in it.\n\n01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:48.080\nIt's like a side yard with a lot of loud stuff in it.\n\n01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:50.320\nPatches, is there a quieter way to get in here?\n\n01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:54.200\nDo we, do we have to go be a one man band as we walk in here?\n\n01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:59.760\nNo, we, the cellar access is on the inside, but yeah.\n\n01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:04.640\nWe go in another door, but most of these doors are boarded up.\n\n01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.480\nLet's see, I'm pretty, I'm pretty stealthy.\n\n01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:11.280\nMy spell loadout was, I did offensive to your number.\n\n01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.280\nYeah, I believe so.\n\n01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:13.280\nThe third one.\n\n01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:14.280\nYeah.\n\n01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:15.280\nI'm not very stealthy.\n\n01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.280\nYeah.\n\n01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:19.480\nI don't really have any magic that can help us.\n\n01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.480\nI mean, I'm a gnome.\n\n01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:25.400\nIs it easy for me because I'm smaller to kind of like shimmy through this noisy box and\n\n01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:26.400\nchain area?\n\n01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:27.400\nYou are smaller.\n\n01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:28.400\nYeah.\n\n01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.400\nAll right.\n\n01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:30.400\nIt's too much easier.\n\n01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:33.720\nGuys, do you want to try some of these boarded doors first, try to pry these off, or do you\n\n01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.720\nwant to go?\n\n01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:35.720\nI guess one more question.\n\n01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:40.280\nPatches, is there, are there any functions coming up where, I mean, these doors are boarded\n\n01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:45.080\nup like these guys are relegated to, they're just going to stay in there and never come\n\n01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:46.080\nout.\n\n01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:49.160\nAre they, are there any town hall meetings coming up where?\n\n01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:54.680\nWell, there was a big ceremony, but I don't know anything about that.\n\n01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:57.880\nTell us about the ceremony.\n\n01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:59.760\nI don't know anything about that.\n\n01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:02.000\nThey just said, said it needed to be guarded.\n\n01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.640\nI mean, the ceremony happened in there.\n\n01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:05.640\nI don't know, man.\n\n01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:10.440\nI think you don't know if the ceremony happened in the, I don't think it's happened yet.\n\n01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.080\nThere's a ceremony about to happen.\n\n01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:13.080\nI don't know, man.\n\n01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:14.440\nThey don't tell me nothing.\n\n01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:17.240\nThis guy, they locked me out of the fucking church.\n\n01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.240\nWe should light that door on fire.\n\n01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.240\nWe got to just get in there.\n\n01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.240\nYeah.\n\n01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:21.240\nAnd the fire isn't loud, right?\n\n01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.400\nI, I, fire isn't loud.\n\n01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:24.400\nWhat do you wait?\n\n01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:25.400\nWhat are you suggesting?\n\n01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:26.400\nI don't know.\n\n01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.120\nWe'll light that door on fire and they're like in the basement.\n\n01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:33.080\nWe can't light, we tried lighting doors on fire.\n\n01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:34.080\nIt's mostly stuff.\n\n01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:35.080\nIt got us here.\n\n01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:40.240\nI have the feeling we don't know if here is better than where we were before we started\n\n01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:41.240\nlighting doors on fire.\n\n01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:42.240\nHow about this?\n\n01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:43.240\nI'm an optimist.\n\n01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:46.240\nWhy don't we just stay in this passageway and just dress up like cows again and wait?\n\n01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:47.240\nAll right.\n\n01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:48.240\nAll right.\n\n01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:49.240\nLet's, let's, who's stealthy?\n\n01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:50.240\nWho's stealthy?\n\n01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:51.240\nI am a four.\n\n01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:52.240\nI'm not very stealthy, but real quick.\n\n01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.840\nI have the feeling this, this boxes and chain kind of situation is kind of a crude alarm\n\n01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:56.840\nsystem, right?\n\n01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:57.840\nSure.\n\n01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:58.840\nWell, I mean, it's a de facto one.\n\n01:36:58.840 --> 01:36:59.840\nYeah.\n\n01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:00.840\nDe facto.\n\n01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:01.840\nIt's like in a video game where, but I'm metagaming.\n\n01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:02.840\nAll right.\n\n01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:03.840\nBut that's accurate metagaming.\n\n01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:04.840\nOkay.\n\n01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:07.840\nI mean, it's like a, it's like a tough place to crawl through.\n\n01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:11.840\nYou're going to have to impress us like Katherine Stena Jones and you know, I, I, I don't have.\n\n01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:16.080\nYou're going to have to do your little booty move through the, I, I, I have a lot of dexterity,\n\n01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.080\nnot a lot of stealth.\n\n01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:18.080\nDo you have acrobatics?\n\n01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:19.080\nUh, you, you know.\n\n01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.080\nOh.\n\n01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.080\nAll right.\n\n01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.080\nWell, dexterity is good.\n\n01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:33.080\nI have some stealth for what's your dexterity to top left 15, I got to teach you how to\n\n01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.080\nread that.\n\n01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.080\nPaches.\n\n01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:38.480\nHe's more dexterous than me and he's more stealthy than me.\n\n01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:39.480\nYeah.\n\n01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.480\nNo, he should go.\n\n01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:41.480\nYeah.\n\n01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:42.480\nWhat, what, what do you think I should do?\n\n01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:45.240\nI think you start, try to get through and like just see what you see on the opposite\n\n01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:46.480\nside of this debris here.\n\n01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:47.480\nAll right.\n\n01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:51.080\nI want to, and then you can tross us a tross as a rope.\n\n01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:55.680\nIt's a, it's a, uh, uh, from an upstairs window, I bet.\n\n01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:56.680\nOh.\n\n01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:57.680\nOkay.\n\n01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:06.880\nI want to dexterously and stealthily make my way across the room past all the loud metal\n\n01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:07.880\nstuff.\n\n01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:10.080\nYou said your dexterity was 15, right?\n\n01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:11.080\nYeah.\n\n01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:12.080\nThe roll of dice.\n\n01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:13.080\n15 plus anything?\n\n01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.080\nPlus two.\n\n01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:15.080\nOoh.\n\n01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.080\n17.\n\n01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:19.480\nUh, the roll of dice will be on my phone.\n\n01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:21.080\nYou're not just being a loof.\n\n01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:22.080\nNo.\n\n01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:25.480\nJohn Favreau needs a GM and you're like, dude.\n\n01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:26.980\nAll right.\n\n01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:27.980\nYou successfully, yeah.\n\n01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:29.480\nNo, I left my dice somewhere.\n\n01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:30.480\nSorry.\n\n01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:34.480\nUh, you successfully sneak through the passageway and make it to the other side.\n\n01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:40.600\nYou're in a large kind of, uh, inner, inner sanctum kind of inner, inner yard area.\n\n01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:43.480\nIt's a large inner sanctum yard area.\n\n01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:47.480\nWhat do, what else would you go find out?\n\n01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:52.760\nThere's a place where you can throw us a rope that we can climb up.\n\n01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.400\nIt's a, what's the answer?\n\n01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:55.400\nI want to cross, right?\n\n01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:56.400\nI didn't go up.\n\n01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.480\nNo, you're right now.\n\n01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:58.480\nYou're just across.\n\n01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:59.480\nYeah.\n\n01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.480\nHow far, how far away is he from us right now?\n\n01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:02.480\nUh, 20 feet.\n\n01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:03.480\nOkay.\n\n01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:04.480\nSo he's right by us.\n\n01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:05.480\nYeah.\n\n01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:06.480\nIt's just a, it's like a side yard.\n\n01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.480\nOkay.\n\n01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:08.480\nDo you want to try it too?\n\n01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:09.480\nShould we?\n\n01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:10.480\nDid it look easy?\n\n01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:11.480\nOr did you just?\n\n01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:12.480\nIs there a cellar door nearby?\n\n01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:15.480\nUh, not that you can see.\n\n01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.480\nDo you see it?\n\n01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:19.480\nDo you see any, any other doors over there?\n\n01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:20.480\nLook around.\n\n01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:21.480\nLook around.\n\n01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:22.480\nFeel around too.\n\n01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:23.480\nExamine your surroundings.\n\n01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:24.480\nThere's always secret stuff.\n\n01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:25.480\nAll right.\n\n01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:26.480\nAll right.\n\n01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:30.480\nI walk around the perimeter and look for doors.\n\n01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:31.480\nUm, okay.\n\n01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:32.480\nAround the perimeter.\n\n01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:33.480\nYou walk around the perimeter.\n\n01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:35.480\nYou see, you see a door and a staircase.\n\n01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:36.480\nYep.\n\n01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:37.480\nThat's all you see in the yard.\n\n01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:42.480\nThere's a two, two, uh, horses that are tied up and, uh, they look great.\n\n01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:43.480\nLook real nice horses.\n\n01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:46.480\nThe nicest horses you've seen several days.\n\n01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:50.480\nUm, you guys, they're the nicest horses I've ever seen out here.\n\n01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:51.480\nStay, stay focused.\n\n01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:53.480\nYou don't, you don't understand.\n\n01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:56.480\nWe have to let, we have to take these horses with us.\n\n01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:00.480\nIf we, if we can hear you, people inside can hear you.\n\n01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:03.480\nYou can't, you don't have a walkie-talkie.\n\n01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.480\nWhatever that will end up being.\n\n01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.480\nThey're beautiful.\n\n01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:09.480\nI can't hear you because you're being quiet.\n\n01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:12.480\nDoes the staircase go up or down?\n\n01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:16.480\nIt goes up.\n\n01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:20.480\nYou guys, I'm just going to go exploring.\n\n01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:21.480\nShhh.\n\n01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:28.480\nI, I, I, I'm sorry.\n\n01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:31.480\nI, I'm going to go up.\n\n01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:32.480\nYes, go.\n\n01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.480\nBut they're so beautiful.\n\n01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:35.480\nStop talking about it.\n\n01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:36.480\nJust go.\n\n01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:37.480\nYou have to see.\n\n01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:39.480\nIf you get caught in there.\n\n01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:42.480\nBeautiful golden fur.\n\n01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:44.480\nSpencer, I go up the stairs.\n\n01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:45.480\nAll right.\n\n01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:46.480\nYou do that.\n\n01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:47.480\nUm, you do that.\n\n01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:48.480\nYou go up into a room.\n\n01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:53.480\nIt looks kind of like the room of a, a tavern or an inn kind of.\n\n01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:55.480\nUh, it's, it's like from a video game.\n\n01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:59.480\nIt's a narrow hallway and each side of the hallway is flanked by three doors.\n\n01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:03.480\nIt seems like it's like a sleeping quarters kind of upstairs room.\n\n01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:07.480\nThere's so many doors.\n\n01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:08.480\nSix even.\n\n01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:13.480\nSix, six, six doors.\n\n01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:18.480\nLet's, let's see what's behind door number three.\n\n01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:19.480\nOkay.\n\n01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:24.480\nGo with your gut, man.\n\n01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.480\nGo with your gut.\n\n01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.480\nAll right.\n\n01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:29.480\nYou open the door.\n\n01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.480\nWait.\n\n01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.480\nSorry.\n\n01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:32.480\nYou open the door.\n\n01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:33.480\nOh, it's nice.\n\n01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:34.480\nYou see a chest.\n\n01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:37.480\nThere's a chest at the floor of a bed.\n\n01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:38.480\nLike a treasure chest.\n\n01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:43.480\nWell, there's just chests as a more standard form of storage in this world.\n\n01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:45.480\nOh, that's not exciting.\n\n01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:52.480\nSo there's a chest and there's a bed and there's a person in the bed and they're asleep because\n\n01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:54.480\nyou're still pretty quiet.\n\n01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:58.480\nHow can we, can we, can, can we have a turnout here?\n\n01:41:58.480 --> 01:41:59.480\nYeah.\n\n01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:00.480\nYeah.\n\n01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:03.480\nPatience is like, Hey, remember when I held outside the front door?\n\n01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:07.480\nCan we, are we, because aren't you kind of, you may not be stealthy, but you are acrobatic,\n\n01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:08.480\nright?\n\n01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:09.480\nIs there, is there a way for you to get in?\n\n01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:10.480\nI'm not, I'm dexterous.\n\n01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:11.480\nI'm not, I'm not super acrobatic.\n\n01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:14.480\nI have a fly.\n\n01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:15.480\nThat sounds promising.\n\n01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:16.480\nNo.\n\n01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:17.480\nFly to anyone.\n\n01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:18.480\nThat's misleading.\n\n01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:20.480\nI have a, I'm good at climbing.\n\n01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.480\nI'm a great climber.\n\n01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.480\nGreat.\n\n01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:24.480\nIs there, what's the outside of this building look like?\n\n01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:26.480\nIt's like rough, hewn stone bricks.\n\n01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:27.480\nRuff, hewn.\n\n01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:28.480\nIt may as well be a ladder.\n\n01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.480\nYeah.\n\n01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.480\nExactly.\n\n01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:33.480\nYou made this place out of ladders.\n\n01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.480\nYeah.\n\n01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:39.480\nI, I, I won't, remember when I climbed the porcelain tower of Benithra Hall?\n\n01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:40.480\nYeah.\n\n01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.480\nYes, I do.\n\n01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:42.480\nYeah.\n\n01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:44.480\nThat was, it was made of porcelain.\n\n01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:45.480\nYeah.\n\n01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:46.480\nAll right.\n\n01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:48.480\nHow high is the, is this wall?\n\n01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:49.480\nIt's 40 feet.\n\n01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.480\nOkay.\n\n01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:51.480\nI'm going to start climbing that motherfucker.\n\n01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.480\nOh yeah.\n\n01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:53.480\nYou do that.\n\n01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:54.480\nYou easily make it on.\n\n01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:55.480\nDid I say 40 feet?\n\n01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:56.480\nLet's say 25 feet.\n\n01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:57.480\nOkay.\n\n01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:02.480\nYou make it on to what looks like a kitchen as you can see in the windows climbing on.\n\n01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:06.480\nAnd if you get in trouble up there, you guys just start yelling and I'll come blazing in\n\n01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:10.480\nbecause sadly, relative to this party, I'm what the millennials call a tank.\n\n01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.480\nWait, so I made it up into a kitchen?\n\n01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:16.480\nNo, you're on top of a kitchen.\n\n01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:17.480\nHow do I know it's a kitchen?\n\n01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:18.480\nBecause you saw in the windows.\n\n01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:19.480\nOkay.\n\n01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:23.480\nIs there any way to tie off a rope and, and, and, and let him climb up?\n\n01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:24.480\nYeah.\n\n01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:25.480\nThere's a gargoyle.\n\n01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:26.480\nOkay.\n\n01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:27.480\nI'd, I'd, I'd sweet.\n\n01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:28.480\nYeah.\n\n01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:30.480\nAnd those Batman games and gargoyles.\n\n01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:31.480\nOkay.\n\n01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:32.480\nThat's fucking.\n\n01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:38.480\nI tie off my rope and toss it down and, and, and, and say, hey, we got a kitchen up here.\n\n01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.480\nThanks.\n\n01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:40.480\nAll right.\n\n01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:44.480\nI'm going to come up with my climb of zero.\n\n01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:46.480\nWhat's your deck?\n\n01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:49.480\nThis is going to be great.\n\n01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.480\nDexterity.\n\n01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.480\nGo ahead.\n\n01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:52.480\nDexterity.\n\n01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:53.480\nDexterity is 12.\n\n01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:54.480\nAll right.\n\n01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:56.480\nYou do it.\n\n01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.480\nIt's easy to climb up a rope.\n\n01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:01.480\nTell that to me.\n\n01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:02.480\nNo, I don't.\n\n01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:04.480\nIt's hard.\n\n01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:07.480\nThese are, these are knotted ropes meant to be climbed up easily.\n\n01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:10.480\nI'm on top of this my entire childhood.\n\n01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:11.480\nI look around.\n\n01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.480\nCan I see into the inner area?\n\n01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.480\nYeah.\n\n01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:15.480\nYou can see the yard.\n\n01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:16.480\nOh man.\n\n01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:17.480\nYou see two horses.\n\n01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:18.480\nThey're like real nice.\n\n01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:19.480\nOh.\n\n01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:20.480\nOh fuck.\n\n01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:22.480\nWait, wait, we saw.\n\n01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:26.480\nNo, no, look, you're not going to believe these horses.\n\n01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:27.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:29.480\nHe was, he wasn't exaggerating.\n\n01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:30.480\nLook at these things.\n\n01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:32.480\nWait, how are we looking at the horses?\n\n01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:34.480\nI'm picturing us like we climbed up something.\n\n01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:35.480\nYeah.\n\n01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:36.480\nYou're on top of the kitchen.\n\n01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:37.480\nOh, because he went up the stairs.\n\n01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:38.480\nYeah.\n\n01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:41.980\nSo the buildings kind of, the buildings like a big square with a big square in the middle\n\n01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:42.980\nof it.\n\n01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:46.480\nSo you're kind of on the peripheral square and you're looking into the yard and the\n\n01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.480\ninside of it in the middle square.\n\n01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:50.480\nOh, there's horses down there.\n\n01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:51.480\nDown there.\n\n01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:52.480\nThose are beautiful horses.\n\n01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:53.480\nYeah.\n\n01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:59.480\nAlso, across the yard, you can see, you can see like a, what are you, it looks like an,\n\n01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:00.480\nlike an abbey.\n\n01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:01.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:03.480\nIt looks like a fucking mission building, you know, those long kind of mission.\n\n01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:08.080\nAnd in the window, you can see Steve opens the door and he's like, he's, he's walking\n\n01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:10.840\ninto one of these bedrooms and you can kind of see him.\n\n01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:12.480\nYou don't, you don't really see too well.\n\n01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:13.480\nYou just see him over there.\n\n01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:14.480\nOkay.\n\n01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:16.480\nHe's walking one of the doors.\n\n01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:17.480\nLet's go.\n\n01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:20.480\nCan we, can we walk around on the rooftops all the way around this to where he is?\n\n01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:25.480\nYeah, but it'll end, you'll end up on top of his roof, on top of the roof that he's\n\n01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:26.480\nunder.\n\n01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:28.480\nSo you'll be on top of him.\n\n01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:30.480\nBut is there access through that roof?\n\n01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:32.480\nLike to that staircase or anything like that?\n\n01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.480\nCould we get to the staircase?\n\n01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:36.480\nYou'd have to climb back down on the inside of the yard kind of.\n\n01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:37.480\nOkay.\n\n01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:38.480\nRight.\n\n01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:39.480\nWell, he saw the horses and walked past the horses.\n\n01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:41.480\nI said, we just, we just get in there and everyone's asleep.\n\n01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:42.480\nLet's be quiet.\n\n01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.480\nOr do you want to go rooftop?\n\n01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:46.480\nWait, I'm, I'm sorry.\n\n01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:50.480\nWe're kind of like walking the guard wall around a courtyard, right?\n\n01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:51.480\nRight.\n\n01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:52.480\nAnd within the courtyard, there's an abbey.\n\n01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:53.480\nYeah.\n\n01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.480\nAnd the abbey is now we're leaving.\n\n01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:57.480\nWell, no, actually the buildings are like the courtyard.\n\n01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:02.480\nThey, like, or the buildings form the guard wall, like all these buildings form a perimeter,\n\n01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:03.480\nbut the buildings themselves.\n\n01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:04.480\nYeah.\n\n01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:06.480\nSo why don't we just go to the roof of the building that we saw diarrhea.\n\n01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:07.480\nOkay.\n\n01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:08.480\nAll right.\n\n01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:12.480\nAnd well, I'm waking, it seems to me like at least all the video games I play, that's\n\n01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.480\nthe, you know, may as well do that.\n\n01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:15.480\nOkay.\n\n01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:16.480\nI keep my rope.\n\n01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:17.480\nOkay.\n\n01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:18.480\nYou get it.\n\n01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:19.480\nOkay.\n\n01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:21.480\nYou think, you think it's quieter to walk on people's roofs while they're sleeping or\n\n01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:23.480\njust to tiptoe across the courtyard?\n\n01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:24.480\nNo, I do not.\n\n01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:25.480\nNo.\n\n01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:27.480\nWhen you put it to me that way, I do not think that way.\n\n01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:28.480\nAll right.\n\n01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.480\nI, I keep my rope tied to the gargoyle and leave it there in case we need to get out that\n\n01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:33.480\nway.\n\n01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:34.480\nI'm going to leave that rope there.\n\n01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.480\nAre you, are you going to climb down into the courtyard now?\n\n01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:38.480\nOkay.\n\n01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:39.480\nWe'll get down in the courtyard.\n\n01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:40.480\nYeah.\n\n01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:41.480\nWe'll pass the horses into the abbey.\n\n01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:42.480\nYeah.\n\n01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:44.480\nBut my rope's going to have to stay there because there's no one to get the rope off.\n\n01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:45.480\nOkay.\n\n01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:46.480\nRight?\n\n01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:47.480\nYeah.\n\n01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:48.480\nOkay.\n\n01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:49.480\nYeah.\n\n01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:50.480\nIt's a good, it's a good rope to have.\n\n01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:51.480\nOkay.\n\n01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:52.480\nYeah.\n\n01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:53.480\nAll right.\n\n01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:54.480\nThere.\n\n01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.480\nOkay.\n\n01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:56.480\nSo we, we climbed down.\n\n01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:57.480\nOh yeah.\n\n01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.480\nWait.\n\n01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.480\nYou climbed down the rope.\n\n01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:00.480\nYes.\n\n01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.480\nYes.\n\n01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:02.480\nGot it.\n\n01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:03.480\nOkay.\n\n01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:04.480\nYou're in the courtyard.\n\n01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:05.480\nHorses, like storage equipment, staircase, one door.\n\n01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:06.480\nOkay.\n\n01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:07.480\nWe go up that staircase.\n\n01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:08.480\nSteve's hall.\n\n01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:09.480\nYou see the door.\n\n01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:10.480\nIt's still open.\n\n01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:11.480\nYou see Steve.\n\n01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:12.480\nHe's looking at you.\n\n01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:13.480\nHey.\n\n01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:14.480\nHey.\n\n01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:16.480\nWe need the horses.\n\n01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:18.480\nWe don't need horses.\n\n01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:19.480\nI just.\n\n01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:20.480\nYeah.\n\n01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:22.480\nThis is the problem with your generation.\n\n01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:23.480\nI want it.\n\n01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:24.480\nIt's conspicuous consumption.\n\n01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.480\nYou don't need those horses.\n\n01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:27.480\nYou only just saw that.\n\n01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:28.480\nThey're so beautiful.\n\n01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:30.480\nIt could hold all of my armor and swords.\n\n01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:33.480\nI have, I have a perfect horse for you.\n\n01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:38.480\nIt's called two legs and, and, and self-reliance.\n\n01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.480\nOkay.\n\n01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.480\nLook, I'll make you a deal.\n\n01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:43.480\nOkay.\n\n01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:50.480\nIf the shit, it's the medieval equivalent of a fan.\n\n01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:51.480\nYeah.\n\n01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:53.480\nJust a different fan.\n\n01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:55.480\nA front.\n\n01:47:55.480 --> 01:48:01.480\nWe, of course, when we leave, we'll take the horses.\n\n01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:03.480\nIt's a perfect escape vehicle.\n\n01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.480\nGreat.\n\n01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:05.480\nYeah.\n\n01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.480\nBut we're not, right now, we need to focus.\n\n01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:08.480\nOkay.\n\n01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:10.480\nI go over and, can I see the face of the sleeping person in this room?\n\n01:48:10.480 -->

go to the library for some reason.\n\n01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:40.480\nNo, because the library is where the, where the priors, his, his bedrooms in, or it's\n\n01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:41.480\nnear the library.\n\n01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:42.480\nIt's in the library.\n\n01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:45.480\nIs there, is there an underground, like kind of like, like a, like a dungeony kind of,\n\n01:53:45.480

option.\n\n01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:03.480\nWhere's that event happening?\n\n01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:04.480\nThe ceremony?\n\n01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:05.480\nThe ceremony.\n\n01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:06.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:08.480\nProbably somewhere in the church that they boarded up.\n\n01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:09.480\nI'll go in there.\n\n01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:10.480\nLike in the non-existent cellar.\n\n01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:11.480\nWe should have lit that door on fire.\n\n01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:13.480\nWhy do you want us to split up right now?\n\n01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:16.480\nBecause we've thrown out like nine places to go.\n\n01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:19.480\nAnd I, I think somebody should go down.\n\n01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:23.480\nI'm not going to say who I think it should be, but someone should go examine those horses\n\n01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:27.480\nand see if there's any like identifying like, you know, like saddlebag stuff.\n\n01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:28.480\nI'll do it.\n\n01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:31.480\nLet me examine those horses.\n\n01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:33.480\nAnd you're going to check on the prioritor?\n\n01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:34.480\nThe church.\n\n01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:36.480\nYou're going to go to the library and check out on the.\n\n01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:37.480\nOh, okay.\n\n01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:39.480\nYou want to, you take the church.\n\n01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:40.480\nWait.\n\n01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:41.480\nThe church is the church.\n\n01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:42.480\nRight.\n\n01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:45.480\nThe library is a different place and that's where the prior sleeps.\n\n01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:49.480\nIf you're stealthier, you should, the sleeping prior, you should go check on him.\n\n01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:50.480\nI'll take sleeping prior.\n\n01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:51.480\nYeah.\n\n01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:52.480\nSee if there's any signs that he's been out and about.\n\n01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:53.480\nYeah.\n\n01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:54.480\nIf he's there.\n\n01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:55.480\nIf he's not there.\n\n01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:56.480\nJackpot.\n\n01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:57.480\nOkay.\n\n01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:58.480\nMeat.\n\n01:54:58.480 --> 01:54:59.480\nLet's all meat.\n\n01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:00.480\nLet's meet back at the church.\n\n01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:01.480\nLet's meet back at my rope.\n\n01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:02.480\nAt your rope.\n\n01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:04.480\nLet's meet back at your rope in.\n\n01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:06.480\nWhy did you look at your wrist?\n\n01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:09.480\nWhy did you stop and look at your wrist?\n\n01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:14.480\nHave you guys seen Hudson Hawk?\n\n01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:15.480\nDo you know any show tunes?\n\n01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:16.480\nYes.\n\n01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:17.480\nWe can sing while we check.\n\n01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:18.480\nAll right.\n\n01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:19.480\nAll right.\n\n01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:20.480\nNo, never mind.\n\n01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:21.480\nAll right.\n\n01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:22.480\nLet's meet back.\n\n01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:25.480\nHow did people keep time?\n\n01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:28.480\nWhen the moon.\n\n01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:29.480\nWhen the moon.\n\n01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:33.480\nThe moon is descending over this part of the sky.\n\n01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:35.480\nBefore the moon touches the top of that tree.\n\n01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:37.480\nWhen standing in the middle of the courtyard.\n\n01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:40.480\nIn the middle of the courtyard.\n\n01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:43.480\nWell, let's just meet in the middle of the courtyard.\n\n01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:44.480\nOkay.\n\n01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:45.480\nOkay.\n\n01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:48.480\nIn about five minutey things.\n\n01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:49.480\nYeah.\n\n01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:50.480\nAll right.\n\n01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:51.480\nOkay, guys.\n\n01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:54.480\nPut your hands in the middle because we can't do all this stuff.\n\n01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:58.480\nWe have to make it a dramatic thing like a serialized Netflix show.\n\n01:55:58.480 --> 01:55:59.480\nWe have to turn an ending.\n\n01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:04.480\nYou have to make an ending out of what is otherwise just an 800 minute movie.\n\n01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:05.480\nOkay.\n\n01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:07.480\nYou're the elder of our group.\n\n01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:12.480\nDo you want to say a little prayer to the church of the flame, the silver flame?\n\n01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:16.480\nGuys, I believe in our religion.\n\n01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:19.480\nI don't believe in our church.\n\n01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:20.480\nI said it.\n\n01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:24.480\nYou found it out now.\n\n01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:31.480\nWe're in a fucking mission from the silver flame.\n\n01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:33.480\nYou believe in the silver flame though?\n\n01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:34.480\nFuck yes.\n\n01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:35.480\nYes.\n\n01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:38.480\nThat's why I don't like the church of the silver flame.\n\n01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:44.480\nDude, this is not the best time to be laying this honest, man.\n\n01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:45.480\nYou guys both learned from me.\n\n01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:47.480\nI saw a promise in you.\n\n01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:49.480\nI actually fudged some of the memos.\n\n01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:55.480\nThey sent me here on a suicide mission and I said, I want my two boys with me.\n\n01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:56.480\nWait.\n\n01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:57.480\nWith my right hand?\n\n01:56:57.480 --> 01:56:58.480\nJackpot.\n\n01:56:58.480 --> 01:56:59.480\nSee you in five.\n\n01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:00.480\nWhat?\n\n01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:07.480\nCliffing

Harmon.\n\n01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:51.480\nThere you go.\n\n01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:53.480\nSee ya.\n\n01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:57.480\nThere was the guy from West Virginia that tweeted he came for a rap.\n\n01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:00.480\nHip hop, West Virginia rap.\n\n01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:02.480\nHip hop, West Virginia rap.\n\n01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:03.480\nRap, rap, rap.\n\n01:58:03.480 -->

the stage.\n\n01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:20.480\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.\n\n01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:23.480\nThe Virginias are divided.\n\n01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:26.480\nThey're on different side bits.\n\n01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:28.480\nWest Virginia feels like this.\n\n01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:32.480\nEast Virginia said, just call me this, Virginia.\n\n01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:34.480\nI don't want to be East Virginia.\n\n01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:36.480\nI just want to be Virginia.\n\n01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:38.480\nWest Virginia's like, fuck you then.\n\n01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:40.480\nGonna go over to the West End.\n\n01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:45.480\nAnd then one guy from West Virginia came to the show to hear me rap about it.\n\n01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:47.480\nLame, Lee.\n\n01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:51.480\nSo I did, so I'm a man of my word and a man of my bib.\n\n01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:53.480\nBecause when I eat, I eat like a baby.\n\n01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:55.480\nI eat your mama's pussy.\n\n01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:56.480\nI don't say maybe.\n\n01:58:56.480 --> 01:58:57.480\nNot unbeat.\n\n01:58:57.480 --> 01:58:59.480\nI don't know what I'm doing.\n\n01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:10.480\nI fucked your mama so hard, I started spewing verbally about her experience as a woman.\n\n01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:16.480\nIt's called mansplaining and it's the hot new move.\n\n01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:18.480\nA mansplain to your mama.\n\n01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:19.480\nA mansplain to your daughter.\n\n01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:22.480\nA mansplain to the mountains about the meaning of water.\n\n01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:27.480\nI said, a waterfall goes down because it hates to affect your mama like she was Kathy Bates.\n\n01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:32.480\nAnd I said, body positive.\n\n01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:35.480\nI fucked your mama, explained it to her.\n\n01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:40.480\nAnd she said, well, now that you said it that way, I get it.\n\n01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:41.480\nAnd I left.\n\n01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:43.480\nAnd I explained some more.\n\n01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:46.480\nAnd we'll explain more next week. We're doing the show Saturday next week too.\n\n01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:48.480\nThank you guys.
