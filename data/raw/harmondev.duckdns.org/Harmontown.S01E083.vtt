At one point the entire\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:44.000\nroom is slightly flooded than frozen and we all skate out to the parking lot.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:48.000\nSpecial Christmas wishes, dances\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:52.000\na little Christmas wrap.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:56.000\nAnd then a very heartwarming poem that you improvised at the very end.\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:00.000\nAnd gifts. Gifts for everybody.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:04.000\nWe'll figure it out.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:08.000\nThis would be a good time for a beef steak bill to step into action\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:12.000\nand bring him back full of goodies.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:16.000\nI think it must be said that\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:20.000\nOh god damn it. Forgotten your name.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:24.000\nAnatoly has dressed up like some sort of weird cross between\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:28.000\nSt. Nick and Krampus.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:32.000\nAnatoly, get on stage. Everybody Instagram the shit out of this right now.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:36.000\nI mean\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:40.000\nWhat in the gay porn is going on up here?\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:44.000\nAnatoly wearing a\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:48.000\nkind of a... As Adam Goldberg\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:52.000\nproperly says, he is Anatoly correct.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:56.000\nHe's wearing a red Santa Tuk and little short shorts\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:00.000\nred in some Ugg boots.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:04.000\nHe's really ready for Santa Monica Boulevard at any moment.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:08.000\nAnatoly, is this your way of saying that it's colder in Russia?\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:12.000\nAre you being kind of like home sick and going like\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:16.000\nfuck you weather pussies. Yeah, fuck you almost differently.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:20.000\nYou seem to be engaged\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:24.000\nin your Soviet given right to intoxication\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:28.000\nas usual.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:32.000\nSome kind of red here.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:36.000\nMerry Christmas. Anatoly.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:40.000\nI won't accept it.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:44.000\nYou're committing to the whole atheist thing in Russia still?\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:48.000\nWell, I mean we have just different kind of Christmas.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:52.000\nThere's one like no one cares about which\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:56.000\nwho cares about Christmas? No one. What is it? What's the Russian Christmas?\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:00.000\nWe celebrate Christmas on like old wrong calendar\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:04.000\nso it's like we celebrate Christmas on\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:08.000\nJanuary 7th and it's like mostly religious holidays\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:12.000\nso most people don't care about it. They just\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:16.000\ndrink and eat.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:20.000\nIs it a winter solstice thing? It's honoring the end of the year? No, no. We have\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:24.000\nNew Year for this. New Year in Russia\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:28.000\nhas got to be pretty intense. Yeah, New Year is basically a knuckle from\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:32.000\nEuropean Christmas. It's how it's like\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\norigins of Russian New Year. They like stole Christmas\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:40.000\nfrom Europe and change Santa Claus to the great\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:44.000\nguy who is way better than Santa Claus. What's his name?\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:48.000\nHis name is in Russian it death morose.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:52.000\nDeath morose? Oh, that's great. I mean that can be great.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:56.000\nDeath morose. And it's mean like...\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:00.000\nIn Soviet Russia year ends you.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:04.000\nI don't remember Soviet part of Russia.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:08.000\nI know, I know. You're post-Yakov Smirnov generation. You don't know.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:12.000\nYou don't even know what that is. I barely know what that is.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:16.000\nWhat part of the Russian holiday tradition brought to mind\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:20.000\ncoming to Harmontown nearly naked?\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:24.000\nI mean it's like after your\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:28.000\ndrugs you have to be naked.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:32.000\nAfter drugs you have to be naked.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:36.000\nAre you on ecstasy right now or mushrooms or what's going on?\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:40.000\nIt might or might not be.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:44.000\nOn ecstasy? Yes. That sounds like a resounding da.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:48.000\nSo are you giving a lot of back rubs,\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:52.000\ngrinding your teeth and promising to call people more often?\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:56.000\nOr has ecstasy changed\n\n05:56.000 --> 06:00.000\nsince I was 25?\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:04.000\nNo, I think I took some MDMA\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:08.000\nin...where was I?\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:12.000\nI can't remember.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:16.000\nBut it's been years since I did anything interesting.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:20.000\nSo you're kind of lame now? I'm kind of lame.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:24.000\nAre you afraid to do hallucinogenic drugs again then?\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:28.000\nSometime around your first mortgage payment\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:32.000\nyou take on the sometime way before your first mortgage payment.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:36.000\nYour first mortgage payment is on even too much marijuana.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:40.000\nI have to be very careful even smoking pot or I'll get very...\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:44.000\nMy freak out threshold is very low.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:48.000\nI'll start panicking. I guess that's what they mean by paranoia.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:52.000\nI never realized it until I realized it.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:56.000\nParanoid about why am I getting high, I'm too old to be getting high, and all this weird shit happens to me.\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:00.000\nBecause I'm outside of God's\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:04.000\nstep, I'm out of rhythm and out of the moment\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:08.000\nand making money and being grown up and that's been going on since I was like...\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:12.000\nIs your concern, Dan, at your age right now, that if you did hallucinogens you might come to\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:16.000\nHarmontown wearing red short shorts?\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:20.000\nI would love to think that I had it in me.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:24.000\nI've always thought of you as kind of a shy fellow. Even though you sit in the front row and you are willing to get up on stage,\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:28.000\nyou seem kind of reserved to yourself.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:32.000\nThis is a very different side of you.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:36.000\nI just don't like to talk but I don't have a mic in my hand.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:40.000\nLook, I'll have what you're having, man.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:44.000\nWho is your dealer?\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:48.000\nI mean, would it be strange if I\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:52.000\nwill say that I'm like 100 drug free?\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:56.000\nWhat? 100 drug free?\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:00.000\n100% right? It's supposed to be 100%.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:04.000\nYou're not 100% drug free.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:08.000\nBut I kind of am.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:12.000\nYou can't be kind of 100%.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:16.000\nYou're something to the gills.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:20.000\nAre you high on life?\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:24.000\nIs it like a stupid expression?\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:28.000\nStupid?\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:32.000\nMaybe you're just really in a good mood and that moves you to do that.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:36.000\nI was differently in a pretty good mood.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:40.000\nYou have almost identical shoulder and back hair patterns to me.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:44.000\nHowever, I am, as Darth Vader said to Luke, it is too late for me.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:48.000\nTake your shirt off.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:52.000\nI think we owe it to the live audience.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:56.000\nYou notice that three people clap.\n\n08:56.000 --> 09:00.000\nNot that it's my fantasy that everyone...\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:04.000\nEven the freak show element of it, people are like,\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:08.000\nI don't want to see it.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:12.000\nWell, Anatoly, I'll give you two choices.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:16.000\nYou can take a seat now, enjoy the rest of the show,\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:20.000\nor you can stay up here as Russian Santa Claus.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:24.000\nI do want to know what does it mean.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:28.000\nIt means, like, Grandpa Frost.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:32.000\nGrandpa Frost?\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:36.000\nDoes Grandpa Frost grant wishes? Does he help people achieve what they want in the new year?\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:40.000\nYes, pretty much. He does everything the same as Santa Claus.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:44.000\nExcept he isn't fat.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:48.000\nBecause he isn't American.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:52.000\nWow. The Cold War just got colder.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:56.000\nThat was the last...\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:00.000\nWell, the shot heard round the kitchenette.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:04.000\nI mean, Santa Claus isn't definitely American,\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:08.000\nso that doesn't make any sense.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nRight. I mean, we kind of Americanized him.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:16.000\nI think we took ownership of that.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.000\nGreen until Coca-Cola co-opted that.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nIs that true or is that an urban legend?\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:24.000\nI believe that's true. Coca-Cola is the reason why he's been branded as a guy that was red and white.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:28.000\nMakes sense to me. I don't know. I don't care.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:32.000\nI think people are too sardonic about Christmas\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:36.000\nbecause the truth is that it's...\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:40.000\nwhatever you're celebrating at this time of year,\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:44.000\nwhat you're really celebrating is the solstice. You're really celebrating the fact that the days\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:48.000\nare about to get the shortest that they'll ever get before slowly\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:52.000\nstarting to become longer again. And, you know, old cavemen,\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:56.000\nwhen young cavemen,\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:00.000\nI believe, I think that they were conscious of how long the\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:04.000\ndays were and how long the nights were. And I think that this time of year\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:08.000\nhas a global condition of mankind, like everyone\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:12.000\nall over the place at this time of year. If you have a winter and you have\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:16.000\nthis sort of solstice where it's sort of ingrained in us\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:20.000\nculturally to celebrate the death of the year\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:24.000\nand ask ourselves what that means and then you cycle this beginning\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:28.000\nand stuff. And there's a really matter that, like, I mean,\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:32.000\nyou got your people who stamped their little feet about how Christianity co-opted\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:36.000\nthis time of year. You got your people that stamped their feet about\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:40.000\nthe war on Christmas and trying to politically correctify everything.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:44.000\nIt's all kind of, I think those people just like choosing this time\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:48.000\nof year to be unhappy and I think that you get to spend this time of year doing\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:52.000\nwhatever you want. It's a little fantasy time. Dan, do you love Christmas? I do.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:56.000\nI really like it because it's something that you mark\n\n11:56.000 --> 12:00.000\nit's a time I'm plotting my bravery.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:04.000\nIt's a bold stance this time of year.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:08.000\nIt's a very bold stance. It's probably not fashionable\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:12.000\nand I don't like the only thing that I like about it is just the fact that it is.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:16.000\nThat it happens once a year. That's it. That doesn't really...\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:20.000\nBut Valentine's Day happens once a year and you don't give a fuck about that, probably.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:24.000\nYeah, you're right. It's got little trade marks to it.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:28.000\nIt's like the Christmas lights go up at the bar. I think that's the thing that I really like\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:32.000\nis like these dive bars\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:36.000\nthat put up Christmas lights. If you're not from here, or if you are, and if you haven't been,\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:40.000\nin that water village. And it's a little dumpy dive bar like the drawing room.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:44.000\nBut around Christmas time, they put up really good Christmas lights\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:48.000\nand they make eggnog that will wipe you out. It's got three\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:52.000\nkinds of booze in it. Go to the roost tonight or soon before\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:56.000\nNew Year's and that's a good Christmas thing and a very good jukebox\n\n12:56.000 --> 13:00.000\nas well. Alright, Russian Santa Claus, we're going to give you an elf now.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:04.000\nWe're going to provide you with a Russian elf.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:08.000\nIt doesn't have elves.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:12.000\nI mean, I can have one.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:16.000\nIn the spirit of Perestroika, please, let's meet each other halfway.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:20.000\nYes, this is a Christmas miracle that's happening right now. We have a\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:24.000\nsemi-naked Russian Santa Claus or Death Morose up here.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:28.000\nAlright, let's bring out Duncan Tressel, our friend.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:34.000\nThis is Anatoly's.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:48.000\nThis is a mic under you.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:52.000\nSo it's a... It's a beard fest. Beard fest!\n\n13:52.000 --> 14:04.180\nokay so thank you for coming Duncan my car was parked outside your house cuz I\n\n14:04.180 --> 14:07.620\ndrunk a couple nights ago and you were in your house

for them like it makes them feel like they're alive to be monitored\n\n15:13.200 --> 15:18.320\nDuncan do you have a do you have any special Christmas memories Christmas\n\n15:18.320 --> 15:24.240\nmemories for better or for worse oh man can you think about one while I\n\n15:24.240 --> 15:30.760\ncomplain about something yes okay it's more of a rhetorical question than a\n\n15:30.760 --> 15:40.600\ncomplaint if you're writing if you're if you're a TV critic and and and I think\n\n15:40.600 --> 15:44.880\nall TV critics are great wonderful misunderstood people who should all be\n\n15:44.880 --> 15:52.160\nappreciated as long as they're writing a network television reviews of networks\n\n15:52.160 --> 15:57.920\nsitcoms those people are great the but I have a question for the TV critics who\n\n15:57.920 --> 16:04.680\ndo reviews of SNL episodes which I didn't remember where they where they\n\n16:04.680 --> 16:11.520\nreview each sketch and talk about what whether or not it was funny yeah am I\n\n16:11.520 --> 16:18.400\nsupposed to read that before I watch the comedy sketch or after and in either\n\n16:18.400 --> 16:24.800\ncase dumb like what what kind of life are we supposed to be living I like that\n\n16:24.800 --> 16:34.200\ncomedy sketch mr. farts huh that's funny farted I wonder what Joe Johnson had to\n\n16:34.200 --> 16:41.680\nsay he he didn't think the farts were funny it's a little insane isn't it\n\n16:41.680 --> 16:46.400\nyeah and here's the even weirder thing I wonder what Joe Johnson recommends huh\n\n16:46.400 --> 16:53.520\nlooks like they did a fart sketch on SNL I think I'll read about it seems like\n\n16:53.520 --> 16:58.680\nthe farts came fast and plenty and overall it was no cone heads but a good\n\n16:58.680 --> 17:07.440\ntime was hats I'm gonna give that sketch a look see Joe Johnson was right\n\n17:07.440 --> 17:15.480\nagain I consumed a sketch using the navigation system of a professional\n\n17:15.480 --> 17:20.640\nsketch reviewer how do you take three minutes to watch the fucking sketch and\n\n17:20.640 --> 17:23.720\nsomebody's got a five paragraph theme about it how did you come across this\n\n17:23.720 --> 17:28.640\nreviewer I just I don't know I saw a thing that I clicked a link in it\n\n17:28.640 --> 17:34.400\nI just I was like what is that really a thing but you know what I feel about that\n\n17:34.400 --> 17:38.000\nthe SNL reviewer I feel the exact same way that I feel about the guy who has to\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:45.120\nwatch people playing Xbox at the NSA it's like you're getting it's like instant\n\n17:45.120 --> 17:49.560\nkarma you're getting what you deserve you have to watch SNL sketches\n\n17:49.560 --> 17:55.480\nprofessionally you have to watch like mildly overweight guys laying on their\n\n17:55.480 --> 18:01.600\ncouch yeah vanishing into oblivion event have a report on somebody's desk at 10\n\n18:01.600 --> 18:07.720\na.m. yeah yeah yeah people are still at Steve Mitchell picked his nose and ate\n\n18:07.720 --> 18:14.240\nit yeah exactly that's what happened I'm not hip to this so they watch you play\n\n18:14.240 --> 18:18.560\nXbox in the event that what that you're good at doing like they have the monkey\n\n18:18.560 --> 18:21.880\nbars like a like a it's just it's just biometrics you're being monitored now\n\n18:21.880 --> 18:25.520\nthey have cameras on these things are really cool I went to Comic Con and\n\n18:25.520 --> 18:31.320\nthey showed Justin and I the Xbox one when we did a Xbox interview for their\n\n18:31.320 --> 18:35.400\nlittle channel and they took us behind a curtain and fired one of these things\n\n18:35.400 --> 18:39.760\nup and it was looking at my skeleton I mean not even not my skeleton but it\n\n18:39.760 --> 18:44.440\nwas it put a skeleton over my body because it could recognize my body and\n\n18:44.440 --> 18:48.920\nknow where each of my knuckles were and my and also Justin standing next to me\n\n18:48.920 --> 18:53.280\nand we were like dancing around and it knew and it and then I started I was\n\n18:53.280 --> 18:56.520\nlaughing the whole time because it was amazing and then I started noticing that\n\n18:56.520 --> 19:02.360\nwhen I smiled it said that I was happy next to my head yeah and so the the the\n\n19:02.360 --> 19:09.360\nthe the Nielsen evolution of this system is kind of obvious that you know no\n\n19:09.360 --> 19:13.840\nlonger need people to crank a dial in order to test a TV show ostensibly\n\n19:13.840 --> 19:20.520\nour entertainment will be in the hands of people who are are so weird that they\n\n19:20.520 --> 19:23.440\nactually smile when they enjoy themselves in their privacy of their\n\n19:23.440 --> 19:28.960\nliving room while watching a National Geographic show but to the extent that\n\n19:28.960 --> 19:33.120\nthat doesn't happen everything on National Geographical could cancel but\n\n19:33.120 --> 19:37.040\nyou can stream you know like there's something called Twitch where you can\n\n19:37.040 --> 19:40.760\nstream playing a game like you can stream playing a game and also I guess\n\n19:40.760 --> 19:45.360\nit films you playing too so like there's already been bad accidents where\n\n19:45.360 --> 19:50.840\nsomeone left that on and and that filmed him and his wife was passed out and it\n\n19:50.840 --> 19:58.360\nlike filmed him rubbing her pussy oh yeah oh really oh I see it was on purpose\n\n19:58.360 --> 20:03.160\nyeah I didn't know that I thought he didn't know he's being monitored rubbing\n\n20:03.160 --> 20:11.240\nbus pussy part Russian Santa Claus what are you doing here\n\n20:11.240 --> 20:15.240\nwere you were you were you watching us did someone

rubbed it rubbed his wife's pussy on\n\n20:35.360 --> 20:41.040\ncamera to make it like as though he was doing with something bad well there's\n\n20:41.040 --> 20:44.040\nactually you remember chat roulette I mean it's like like chat roulette very\n\n20:44.040 --> 20:49.080\nquickly became everyone's got their dick out because there's like yeah that's\n\n20:49.080 --> 20:51.760\nreally that's like that's like those people are the opposite of me like the\n\n20:51.760 --> 20:55.800\nidea that you want to that like the people who want to nothing nothing\n\n20:55.800 --> 20:59.120\nagainst them I'm whatever whatever floats your boat well I mean unless you're\n\n20:59.120 --> 21:02.680\nvictimizing people but but but which which these people sometimes often do\n\n21:02.680 --> 21:08.240\nbecause they need to be like seen jerking off and all this stuff that's like so\n\n21:08.240 --> 21:13.240\nthe opposite of me like I'm so sex is too intimate for me I just really boy I\n\n21:13.240 --> 21:18.760\nwish I could just hide from my partner yeah I know what you mean yeah I do\n\n21:18.760 --> 21:23.160\nDoug Stanhope has a really funny joke about how like you know when you watch\n\n21:23.160 --> 21:28.360\nporn if for those of you watch porn like there's the porn where the camera\n\n21:28.360 --> 21:32.040\nguy will start talking and it always sucks because he's like oh yeah you're\n\n21:32.040 --> 21:35.560\nso hot and it's like you just want to hear this lazy guy talking you just want\n\n21:35.560 --> 21:40.680\nthere to be this kind of sacred silence when this thing is happening but you\n\n21:40.680 --> 21:44.800\nwere talking about Instagram now has become a this this thing you're starting\n\n21:44.800 --> 21:49.840\nto go down well Instagram is like a yet Instagram is the kind of like you can\n\n21:49.840 --> 21:54.960\nchat on Instagram now they just added that they open the floodgates yeah it's\n\n21:54.960 --> 22:00.880\nreally it's a danger it's a this is Dustin Dustin's fault for showing me this\n\n22:00.880 --> 22:06.480\nI was fine and then he like tied my mating impulses in with Instagram and I\n\n22:06.480 --> 22:10.960\ncan't staring at the fucking rectangle so take me through how that works like\n\n22:10.960 --> 22:15.320\nyou're on Instagram and you see a do you see a girl's pictures you took a selfie\n\n22:15.320 --> 22:19.520\nas you kids call us and and you like the way she looks and now you can send her\n\n22:19.520 --> 22:23.200\na message which you couldn't do before right yeah so what happens is now what\n\n22:23.200 --> 22:28.000\nhappens is very attractive people very attractive girls they have this instant\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:32.880\nway to melt dopamine out of their brains which is they just take a picture of\n\n22:32.880 --> 22:37.120\nthemselves and put it on Instagram and then thousands of people like the\n\n22:37.120 --> 22:42.200\npicture and that keeps that that makes them feel like they are connected to\n\n22:42.200 --> 22:45.560\nthe universe and that they're alive or something but that was how Instagram\n\n22:45.560 --> 22:48.400\nalways has been you could you post a photo people like it what's what's the\n\n22:48.400 --> 22:51.400\nnew thing with the check now you can contact people right yeah now you can\n\n22:51.400 --> 22:54.680\nsend people like you'd say hello to people and stuff and then they can write\n\n22:54.680 --> 22:59.680\nyou back and then that pulls you into like a darker vortex of community and\n\n22:59.680 --> 23:04.920\nyou can send a private photo obviously you can yeah since Dustin taught me this\n\n23:04.920 --> 23:09.440\nthing about Instagram I have felt like I was gonna be murdered four times like I\n\n23:09.440 --> 23:14.800\nfelt like honestly in danger and cat you said it's combining Instagram with your\n\n23:14.800 --> 23:18.320\nmating impulses what are you what are your mating impulses well no it's a\n\n23:18.320 --> 23:21.480\nmating ritual you know like people go to a bar and they want to meet people like\n\n23:21.480 --> 23:24.520\neveryone's trying to make people are generally trying to reproduce or they're\n\n23:24.520 --> 23:28.680\nthey're in a monogamous relationship but people are generally driven by their\n\n23:28.680 --> 23:33.480\nsex drives and it used to be you would go into the world to try to do that and\n\n23:33.480 --> 23:38.080\nnow this has been digitized and so there's this whole new thing forming\n\n23:38.080 --> 23:42.120\nwhich is like you know like the way it works is like I don't know what was your\n\n23:42.120 --> 23:46.680\nname it's not only what's up not only and it's only like if I wanted to sleep\n\n23:46.680 --> 23:53.760\nwith you I here's it what he said thank you I would look it if you were awesome\n\n23:53.760 --> 24:14.040\nI thought he said I do but in Russian but you know it's a series of likes so\n\n24:14.040 --> 24:17.160\nyou like someone's picture and then they like your picture and then you like\n\n24:17.160 --> 24:20.000\ntheir picture now you're doing the thing where you that's the digital version\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:23.000\nof looking at someone and looking away and then you catch them looking at you\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:29.480\nnow they got you got the the cupids and the the what's all the dating stuff and\n\n24:29.480 --> 24:36.360\nthere's a Christian mingle swiper swiper tinder well I was I was doing a\n\n24:36.360 --> 24:41.120\nI was doing a comedy show in the Midwest and but now I've but since then I

have to go to the greatest tag new\n\n25:29.840 --> 25:36.600\ncommercial of all time the internet really is ubiquitous now that if there's\n\n25:36.600 --> 25:43.320\npockets of it were for non-city folk that's pretty amazing welcome to\n\n25:43.320 --> 25:51.200\nhillbilly.gov we don't cotton a technology round this domain welcome to\n\n25:51.200 --> 26:01.200\nhomeless hookup great idea employed people just don't get it we really did\n\n26:01.200 --> 26:09.200\nit we also don't know how to monetize this\n\n26:09.200 --> 26:14.200\nthe money's coming in from the from the homeless people there's people there\n\n26:14.200 --> 26:17.080\nmight be people who want to date a farmer or a homeless person like do you\n\n26:17.080 --> 26:22.120\nhave to be another farmer like a sexy lady that's like like like like I would\n\n26:22.120 --> 26:26.000\nsay I'm pretty sure there's a certain percentage of traffic on Christian\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:29.160\nmingle or jade date that aren't Christian or Jewish I would say there's lots of\n\n26:29.160 --> 26:33.000\npeople that are sure phoning in and saying like yeah I love the Lord as much\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:37.040\nas the other next guy I heard that Christian mingle has the highest\n\n26:37.040 --> 26:47.880\nassault rate for a dating site I don't know that's the kind of thing that\n\n26:47.880 --> 26:51.600\nwould immediately have traction like you just created you just created that\n\n26:51.600 --> 26:55.960\nlike like idea that's gonna be well it makes sense doesn't it cuz like if you're\n\n26:55.960 --> 27:03.240\na fundamentalist Christian you believe in a death God you believe in a god that's\n\n27:03.240 --> 27:07.320\neventually gonna destroy the planet sacrificed his child and you worship\n\n27:07.320 --> 27:11.240\nthat being you pray to that being so wouldn't it does make sense that you\n\n27:11.240 --> 27:15.280\nwould it's a sacrifice God so some percentage of the people who go on\n\n27:15.280 --> 27:19.720\nChristian mingle probably still believe the old ways and think where you\n\n27:19.720 --> 27:25.320\nsacrifice your date yeah because God in the Old Testament was always telling\n\n27:25.320 --> 27:30.480\npeople like you must kill your son today right yeah so how does like I'm sure\n\n27:30.480 --> 27:34.320\npeople on Christian mingle the same thing happens where the transmission comes\n\n27:34.320 --> 27:37.640\ndown like if you believe in me you will decapitate probably some casual\n\n27:37.640 --> 27:43.200\nChristians I think that use the internet to date like sure like you know\n\n27:43.200 --> 27:48.320\nlike a kid like a nice like you're like yeah I don't have to be a fundamentalist\n\n27:48.320 --> 27:51.880\nthey're not snakes wrapped around their neck most Christians are in the end of\n\n27:51.880 --> 28:03.400\ndecapitation it is an awesome terrifying God the Old Testament God though I\n\n28:03.400 --> 28:09.160\njust gotten a weird conversation about that with Aaron because I was we were\n\n28:09.160 --> 28:13.000\ntalking about my my Hebrew name Daniel and how I like that story in the Bible\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:18.920\nand the Old Testament God and I was kind of talking about how I like that God and\n\n28:18.920 --> 28:22.200\nshe was kind of she's a pastor's daughter so she kind of like I don't know\n\n28:22.200 --> 28:28.200\nshe did she had a differently she wasn't have an objective I was I was I was\n\n28:28.200 --> 28:31.960\nsomehow offending her an accident I didn't mean to I was just being Joseph\n\n28:31.960 --> 28:37.160\nCambly about it like what what offense did she take I don't know we were\n\n28:37.160 --> 28:42.400\nprobably both drunk and she surely not I think that I think that she took it to\n\n28:42.400 --> 28:47.040\nmean somehow that I that I had a that I that I preferred it to the New Testament\n\n28:47.040 --> 28:52.360\nGod I don't know or that God isn't it well I mean meaning that he had a new\n\n28:52.360 --> 28:57.920\nattitude I think I think that part of the appeal of modern Christianity is that\n\n28:57.920 --> 29:02.840\nsome of the barbarism and misogyny and things that were that the Old\n\n29:02.840 --> 29:08.800\nTestament steeped in it have been somehow can be somehow opted out yet by\n\n29:08.800 --> 29:14.280\nway of the Terminator 2 like like movie you know okay well you've heard it this\n\n29:14.280 --> 29:18.680\nway but now it's like this which is a huge value add to the sequel I love the\n\n29:18.680 --> 29:23.880\nNew Testament I like reading it and I sometimes like it's a good thing to read\n\n29:23.880 --> 29:26.200\nwhen you're meditating or something you'll find a little verse but you\n\n29:26.200 --> 29:31.200\nreally do have to wade through like you have to have a big filter to read any\n\n29:31.200 --> 29:34.640\npart of the New Testament because it's pretty dense it's not just that it's\n\n29:34.640 --> 29:38.400\ndense it's just always it always ends in like there's I was just reading this\n\n29:38.400 --> 29:41.400\nverse in it which is like Christ is sending the disciples out into the\n\n29:41.400 --> 29:47.440\nworld to to spread the message and he says to them you know when go into a\n\n29:47.440 --> 29:51.080\ntown and if they accept you you know give them your blessing and if they\n\n29:51.080 --> 29:54.840\ndon't accept you at the gates of the town shake the dust from your feet and\n\n29:54.840 --> 30:01.480\nsay to them your town is fucked you're so cursed yeah like it's a crater your\n\n30:01.480 --> 30:05.720\ntown is gonna be a crater now so yeah yeah go around go around and check up on\n\n30:05.720 --> 30:09.480\nthem and then if as you're leaving you don't like it give them the yeah it\n\n30:09.480 --> 30:14.280\nmeans like do you're going to get blown up and like I was listening to I like\n\n30:14.280 --> 30:18.840\nlistening to Christian radio it's really fun to listen to Christian radio and\n\n30:18.840 --> 30:23.840\nhighly recommend listening to Christian music and pretending that you're Jesus\n\n30:23.840 --> 30:26.960\nand that the songs\n\n30:29.600 --> 30:38.160\nwhat the fuck how did those wires get crushed no I was very clear about because\n\n30:38.160 --> 30:44.120\nyou will realize how creeped out Jesus would be by Christians if you listen to\n\n30:44.120 --> 30:49.680\nthe way they sing to him I said love each other and they killed me why use\n\n30:49.680 --> 30:53.400\nwhat what is this song about yeah well this I mean this is the this is the\n\n30:53.400 --> 30:58.400\nproblem that I have I that I that I sometimes run into because I'm a I'm a\n\n30:58.400 --> 31:02.680\nrespected person among people who are very intelligent they like their science\n\n31:02.680 --> 31:06.680\nfiction is their personalities that don't typically come with rosary beads\n\n31:06.680 --> 31:13.760\nattached to them and modern Christianity is is you know it's what what\n\n31:13.760 --> 31:18.680\nmodern American Christianity what is that that's not connected at all to to the\n\n31:18.680 --> 31:23.080\nvalue of this mythology which is that there was this guy who was kind of\n\n31:23.080 --> 31:28.720\nawesome he's a heroic figure he really you know it's like we love Martin Luther\n\n31:28.720 --> 31:33.520\nKing Jr. like like like Jesus was like kind of kind of did a lot of that kind\n\n31:33.520 --> 31:38.840\nof shit like sacrifice himself because he believed in people being nice to each\n\n31:38.840 --> 31:43.000\nother and as far as the myth goes it's like it's very empowering the idea of\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:47.520\nthat that that you can be this is Christmas time Christ mess like the\n\n31:47.520 --> 31:52.880\nChrist Christ word means half man half God right like this is a the idea that\n\n31:52.880 --> 31:58.400\nof Christ is supposed to be the idea I thought that we can all do this we can\n\n31:58.400 --> 32:05.480\nall we all have it within us to wield the power of these old Babylonian\n\n32:05.480 --> 32:10.520\nSumerian kind of Mesopotamian like like bogeymen like who make the thunder\n\n32:10.520 --> 32:15.680\ncrack and who make the cancer bloom and who make the cows die overnight like\n\n32:15.680 --> 32:22.360\nall that cosmic chaos that we used to just chalk up to fuck my luck or some\n\n32:22.360 --> 32:28.160\nweird superstition we can start to embody that power take control of it and\n\n32:28.160 --> 32:33.040\nand because as we're doing that we have a responsibility to each other to value\n\n32:33.040 --> 32:37.280\nhuman life and stuff so is that like like like that that what does that have\n\n32:37.280 --> 32:41.960\nto do with Billy Graham yeah nothing that's why that's why the Gnostics say\n\n32:41.960 --> 32:47.400\nthat or I've read that the Gnostics say that in Graham Hancock who's this really\n\n32:47.400 --> 32:51.760\namazing like far out historians like believes that like humans have been\n\n32:51.760 --> 32:58.680\nhere much longer and he up he was telling me that you the Gnostics believe\n\n32:58.680 --> 33:03.920\nthat so Satan the first thing Satan is gonna do is convince everyone that he\n\n33:03.920 --> 33:08.400\nis God or that he is Jesus that's the move you convince people that you're\n\n33:08.400 --> 33:13.640\nyou're the Lord of Love and that's the person that George Bush worshipped is\n\n33:13.640 --> 33:18.720\nactually Satan that modern Christianity is actually Satanism because only it's\n\n33:18.720 --> 33:27.360\nonly Satan would tell a president you should drop bombs no no no lord of\n\n33:27.360 --> 33:32.840\nlove would say that like Jesus is all love Jesus represents love like love at\n\n33:32.840 --> 33:37.520\nall costs love no matter what love everyone and forget about yourself you\n\n33:37.520 --> 33:42.600\nlose yourself completely in love and that's the that's what I think Christianity\n\n33:42.600 --> 33:47.480\nis but somehow it gets diverted and they say this is because of the that Roman\n\n33:47.480 --> 33:51.400\nemperor who recognized that Christianity was spreading and wanted to make it a\n\n33:51.400 --> 33:54.800\nstate religion and that's why I had they had that gathering of people they're\n\n33:54.800 --> 33:58.720\nlike okay this love thing's great but we still need to decapitate and murder\n\n33:58.720 --> 34:03.240\npeople and set things on fire so what just set up all these like weird rules\n\n34:03.240 --> 34:06.920\nlike a country club like about the Trinity and what pants you can wear and\n\n34:06.920 --> 34:12.360\nyeah it's all ridiculous I mean but and and by the way so is so is any like\n\n34:12.360 --> 34:17.600\norganized sect of Taoism Buddhism like if you if you if you let the bread out\n\n34:17.600 --> 34:21.640\nlong enough like all you got you come back ten minutes later and the biggest\n\n34:21.640 --> 34:25.920\ndickhead in the room is in charge like the guy who says like let's all let's\n\n34:25.920 --> 34:29.960\nall do it this way and let's all do it that way go fuck yourself like religion\n\n34:29.960 --> 34:34.800\nis supposed to be a personal tie between an individual or the unknown the very\n\n34:34.800 --> 34:38.520\nconcept of organized religion is incredibly problematic now I'm not\n\n34:38.520 --> 34:43.960\nsaying let's do away with organizing spiritual conversations organizing\n\n34:43.960 --> 34:48.120\nspirit religion at all but what I am saying is that that's it's just like\n\n34:48.120 --> 34:51.440\nthat's not religion things that you're talking to other people about are not\n\n34:51.440 --> 34:56.560\nyour your your relationship with the unknown Jesus said that by the way I\n\n34:56.560 --> 35:00.840\nmean he said a lot of shit but but he talked about how basically prayers that\n\n35:00.840 --> 35:06.440\nyou do in front of other people are they're they're fine and good but\n\n35:06.440 --> 35:10.200\nthey're not they don't really count yeah don't pray on the street corners like\n\n35:10.200 --> 35:13.640\nthe whoever they are do I can't remember you should be in a closet somewhere\n\n35:13.640 --> 35:17.480\nlike like like meditating about this like like like like like really atoning\n\n35:17.480 --> 35:21.120\nwith this thing that can fuck you up you know that book the sacred mushroom in\n\n35:21.120 --> 35:25.400\nthe cross by John Marcus Allegro have you ever heard of that like it I I have a\n\n35:25.400 --> 35:32.640\nquote on the dust jacket got devil in the baked beans is boom by whatever you\n\n35:32.640 --> 35:36.400\njust said that's the devil in the baked beans was a second but I'm largely\n\n35:36.400 --> 35:40.920\nresponsible for that books tremendous sales\n\n35:42.040 --> 35:47.400\nit is theory is that Christianity what started as a mushroom cult and he has\n\n35:47.400 --> 35:51.000\nall these amazing pictures of what do you what do you mean by mushroom cult a\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:55.240\nmushroom cult where the early that Jesus was a mushroom and that the whole thing\n\n35:55.240 --> 35:59.160\nwas like talking about the information they were getting was coming from eating\n\n35:59.160 --> 36:04.600\nmushrooms like the God sacrifice was imbibing mushrooms and the communion was\n\n36:04.600 --> 36:09.360\nactually mushrooms which is why I went like the instruction for communion is\n\n36:09.360 --> 36:13.040\nbefore you take communion you should forgive your enemies you have to make\n\n36:13.040 --> 36:15.960\nsure that you've forgiven everyone because it's if you're gonna go on a\n\n36:15.960 --> 36:19.880\nmushroom trip and you go there in a bad headspace it'll be terrible so the whole\n\n36:19.880 --> 36:24.040\nthing is like a veiled mushroom cult and there's awesome pictures of like in\n\n36:24.040 --> 36:27.480\nthese early Christian churches of Adam and Eve and they're standing\n\n36:27.480 --> 36:31.520\nunderneath clearly a mushroom like they're standing next to there's all\n\n36:31.520 --> 36:37.560\nthese pictures of mushrooms and it's like this is a what's that the tree of\n\n36:37.560 --> 36:40.600\nthe knowledge of good and evil was actually a mushroom and that's Terence\n\n36:40.600 --> 36:46.200\nMcKenna's idea which is like the stoned ape theory that like proto hominids took\n\n36:46.200 --> 36:52.000\nmushrooms and that's what caused this massive expansion of the neocortex way\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:56.480\nback when is because mushrooms grow on the shit of bovine animals which is what\n\n36:56.480 --> 37:00.520\nour early proto hominids would have been hunting and since we're omnivores we\n\n37:00.520 --> 37:03.360\nwould have been eating the mushrooms I could believe that because there's a\n\n37:03.360 --> 37:09.000\nshared experience on mushrooms like Sylas Simon has a sort of set of almost\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:16.720\ninarticulable but by now we've figured out that it's shared the the type of\n\n37:16.720 --> 37:21.760\nconsciousness shift that you have on mushrooms it always happens sometimes you\n\n37:21.760 --> 37:26.520\nhave a bad trip sometimes you think your friend is a Dracula yeah sometimes you\n\n37:26.520 --> 37:30.680\ncome to Harmontown wearing underwear and a Santa hat\n\n37:30.680 --> 37:35.120\noh that's that's the Russian equivalent of home\n\n37:35.120 --> 37:43.920\nthat's it but but but but that because it really is like this weird like people\n\n37:43.920 --> 37:49.880\ntalk about you know like straight lace people who would never like who\n\n37:49.880 --> 37:54.680\nassociate drugs with criminality and but who for one reason or another ended\n\n37:54.680 --> 38:00.280\nup taking this Sylas Simon thing they they report the same experience as a\n\n38:00.280 --> 38:07.000\ngroovy dude they have the same sort of weird momentary realization about\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:11.960\nperspective yeah and an uplifting one not one that makes you feel like a\n\n38:11.960 --> 38:15.640\nmeaningless speck in an infinite universe but one that makes you feel like\n\n38:15.640 --> 38:19.520\nyou're connected to all things yeah and imagine doing that instead of doing it at\n\n38:19.520 --> 38:25.080\na party or in your apartment imagine being in some early ancient Christian\n\n38:25.080 --> 38:29.800\nchurch with incense burning and people saying these weird chants and you're\n\n38:29.800 --> 38:33.480\neating the mushrooms with the intention of connecting with the Godhead that would\n\n38:33.480 --> 38:39.840\nbe a very intense trip but you know it would and it'd be it'd be amazing which\n\n38:39.840 --> 38:43.880\nis why sometimes I think of modern Christianity as people who only like\n\n38:43.880 --> 38:49.200\nit's like people who have stacked wood and they're putting their hands in front\n\n38:49.200 --> 38:53.120\nof the wood and pretending there's a fire there but they haven't lit the wood\n\n38:53.120 --> 38:57.720\non fire and the psychedelic is what ignites the fire and that's what really\n\n38:57.720 --> 39:02.680\ncreates the true feeling of the presence of God by the way you know the\n\n39:02.680 --> 39:06.400\nwhole thing about Christmas of course and Santa Claus is actually a\n\n39:06.400 --> 39:10.560\nrepresentation of the Amanita Muscaria mushroom have you ever heard that no\n\n39:10.560 --> 39:16.800\nyeah man totally like everybody everybody right now reach under your\n\n39:16.800 --> 39:24.760\nseats you'll find a mushroom yeah no 45 minutes it's just gonna get wow there's\n\n39:24.760 --> 39:27.800\na lot of stuff on the internet about it Google search it but the color of the\n\n39:27.800 --> 39:32.520\nAmanita Muscaria mushroom is red and white which is exactly the color that\n\n39:32.520 --> 39:37.280\nSanta Claus wears but that was a later-day thing that he was originally\n\n39:37.280 --> 39:42.080\nnot red and white that was a very later-day 50s 40s Coca-Cola thing like\n\n39:42.080 --> 39:46.440\nthat would he was green and white up until very recently well sometimes the\n\n39:46.440 --> 39:53.040\nAmanita Muscaria is a green and white yeah all right whatever fits into my\n\n39:53.040 --> 40:00.440\nmushroom story asshole you know one thing that academic I love the angle\n\n40:00.440 --> 40:03.320\nthough that like what if we just did prove that Santa and Jesus was just all\n\n40:03.320 --> 40:07.600\nabout mushrooms yeah I don't think it's that big a leap I mean I really don't\n\n40:07.600 --> 40:15.360\nit's yeah well yeah well also also they they say that the druids would hang\n\n40:15.360 --> 40:21.200\nthese mushrooms to dry on pine trees and that that's that that's the whole like\n\n40:21.200 --> 40:26.360\nhey like hanging shit on trees actually comes from drying these mushrooms out to\n\n40:26.360 --> 40:30.720\ndo this like a psychedelic ritual and I'll shut up about mushrooms but there's\n\n40:30.720 --> 40:37.360\none more point I want to make which is that the druids would drink each other's\n\n40:37.360 --> 40:42.920\npiss because if you eat mushrooms this silo-sibon still stays in the urine and\n\n40:42.920 --> 40:46.640\nso just couldn't get enough they couldn't get enough yeah or they drink\n\n40:46.640 --> 40:50.360\ntheir own piss to like start tripping again which you can do and they just\n\n40:50.360 --> 40:55.400\nactually leave out a plate and glass of piss\n\n41:00.440 --> 41:05.720\nyou know one thing one thing that I though when I went through like a like\n\n41:05.720 --> 41:12.640\na heavy-duty kind of like I think getting more into Jesus mythology because of\n\n41:12.640 --> 41:16.200\nCampbell and stuff like that so I started I watched Jesus Christ Superstar\n\n41:16.200 --> 41:21.480\nagain and was like this is this is really cool and and started while I watched\n\n41:21.480 --> 41:24.880\nsome documentaries and stuff and Campbell so compelled you by the myth of\n\n41:24.880 --> 41:28.160\nJesus Christ that you went right out and rented Jesus Christ Superstar they did\n\n41:28.160 --> 41:31.920\nand that's a that's a catchy one man I took Aaron to see that New York she was\n\n41:31.920 --> 41:35.760\nblown away she'd only ever seen God spell man Jesus Christ that will convert\n\n41:35.760 --> 41:41.320\nyou can eat God spells like for breakfast yeah all right so one more\n\n41:41.320 --> 41:44.200\nthing and then we'll get off of Jesus cuz I just got off of him an hour ago you\n\n41:44.200 --> 41:46.640\nknow what I'm saying\n\n41:50.760 --> 41:58.040\nJustin can we can we edit in lightning and thunder or sleigh bells I thought\n\n41:58.040 --> 42:00.920\none of the bit but there's biblical historians you know they're kind of\n\n42:00.920 --> 42:04.920\nlying between academics and you know you know the people that are sort of\n\n42:04.920 --> 42:12.160\nresearching the actual historical person Jesus there's some of them believe\n\n42:12.160 --> 42:20.440\nthat the reason for his personality his character his message that he brought\n\n42:20.440 --> 42:24.480\nwas that as a as a youngster growing up he was an apprentice to his dad who\n\n42:24.480 --> 42:28.560\nprobably would have been a stone mason on a carpenter and I don't know did he\n\n42:28.560 --> 42:32.000\ngrow up in Jerusalem or was it where it was ever so wherever he was like\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:37.000\nspending his his younger years when when you kind of like don't I think wasn't\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:46.040\nhe was yeah thank you sir but but is he Jesus who hung out in Nazareth though he\n\n42:46.040 --> 42:50.880\nwas 38 or is he Jesus who was born in Nazareth and like he was he was he was\n\n42:50.880 --> 42:56.160\nborn in Long Beach yeah and then he lived in that anyways when he was\n\n42:56.160 --> 43:00.600\napprenticing for his dad he would have been in this tremendous port city being\n\n43:00.600 --> 43:04.840\na stone mason would have been exposed if he was going if he was working in\n\n43:04.840 --> 43:10.200\nimports and exports as a stone mason might in that city like like kind of\n\n43:10.200 --> 43:16.440\nbeen exposed to a lot of Eastern philosophy coming coming in off of those\n\n43:16.440 --> 43:20.400\nthose same docs I don't know talking out of my butt but I always thought that\n\n43:20.400 --> 43:39.120\nwas interesting it's the least wonderful time I don't know my wish from\n\n43:39.120 --> 43:43.720\nRussian Santa that's you're really warm you're really warm I'm not gonna touch\n\n43:43.720 --> 43:47.920\nyou anymore you're really warm all right what what what topic do you have\n\n43:47.920 --> 43:54.160\nownership over this evening what is it that we said that made you entitled to\n\n43:54.160 --> 44:00.200\nlook religion the idea that the majority of religion how much of religion did you\n\n44:00.200 --> 44:05.160\nattribute to mushrooms at least all of it or just the big one that the other\n\n44:05.160 --> 44:10.920\nones I didn't I didn't attribute to I was I was citing a book that isn't a\n\n44:10.920 --> 44:15.240\nTed talk or a Senate hearing like nothing's nothing's gonna happen if you\n\n44:15.240 --> 44:23.440\ndon't do anything the worst-case scenario is a good show that's it if you\n\n44:23.440 --> 44:27.120\njust listen no there's no nothing no nobody's gonna kick in your door\n\n44:27.120 --> 44:30.400\ntomorrow night and like go you didn't say anything when Duncan trust also the\n\n44:30.400 --> 44:34.840\nmushrooms were religion they came for Duncan trust when I did nothing and then\n\n44:34.840 --> 44:38.280\nthey came for the stone masons and I did nothing and then they kicked in my\n\n44:38.280 --> 44:43.320\ndoor don't bring the Holocaust into this I was gonna bring in the expulsion that\n\n44:43.320 --> 44:50.160\nhappened 400 years ago in Prague but what ifs so religion is a really\n\n44:50.160 --> 44:54.960\nimportant personal force I believe that a lot of what our spiritual journeys do\n\n44:54.960 --> 44:59.840\ntake place internally but the idea that the representation of religion is\n\n44:59.840 --> 45:05.480\nsomething that people go together to ignore God and just to worship a fire\n\n45:05.480 --> 45:09.800\nthat isn't there just seems problematic as someone who's had a lot of his\n\n45:09.800 --> 45:15.480\nreligious I played the fuck out of Linus when I was in Charlie Brown I did\n\n45:15.480 --> 45:24.040\nnot puke on my director when I was in Charlie I was gonna end my speech by\n\n45:24.040 --> 45:34.440\nsinging Mary we wish you a merry Christmas but alright as someone who's\n\n45:34.440 --> 45:38.280\nhad a lot of wonderful experiences being around people around the Christmas\n\n45:38.280 --> 45:42.920\ntree spending holidays letting them in or doing things like that when you see\n\n45:42.920 --> 45:47.040\nreligion as something that doesn't connect you one way to God but you to\n\n45:47.040 --> 45:51.000\nGod to everyone else that you're willing to spend time with religion can be a\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:54.960\nwonderful social leveler it can be a reason to get out of your house it can\n\n45:54.960 --> 45:59.280\nbe a reason to visit the invalid and charity and especially Christian\n\n45:59.280 --> 46:03.400\ncharity is not something that is easy it is something that we choose to do\n\n46:03.400 --> 46:06.600\nbecause of what we believe to help people out who are less fortunate who\n\n46:06.600 --> 46:14.360\nare more Goldbergian than Harmonian let's say in our society I'm not you're\n\n46:14.360 --> 46:20.160\nbooing me and you prove my point but the losers of people trip over the words the\n\n46:20.160 --> 46:24.000\npeople who have the only tie that we have to them in our society is that they\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:28.400\nhad they have their names written in the same type of book in the beginning of\n\n46:28.400 --> 46:34.560\npages where you keep the family history the same scroll the same commandments\n\n46:34.560 --> 46:46.560\nCrucify him! He's here to save Christmas you guys. Adam Goldberg came on stage to us.\n\n46:46.560 --> 46:49.800\nAnd it's the reason that we go we go away to the cold and the snow when we\n\n46:49.800 --> 46:55.720\nrather be playing Xbox and we sing we wish you a merry Christmas we wish you\n\n46:55.720 --> 47:02.840\na merry Christmas we wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year thank you\n\n47:02.840 --> 47:10.920\nAdam Goldberg! Adam Goldberg everybody. What's your mind, reindeer?\n\n47:10.920 --> 47:15.480\nHe wants to know where his reindeer are. Something about his reindeer.\n\n47:15.480 --> 47:21.440\nDuncan, Anatoly can we can we talk a little bit about this because I have\n\n47:21.440 --> 47:30.240\nsome opinions about this song. In my estimation the shittiest Christmas song\n\n47:30.240 --> 47:35.760\never ever perpetrated on mankind. This is a bad one. I've even heard that Paul\n\n47:35.760 --> 47:39.400\nMcCartney is ashamed of himself for this. Not so ashamed that he's had it\n\n47:39.400 --> 47:42.720\nstricken from the record. I'm proud of you because every year Jeff and I have a\n\n47:42.720 --> 47:46.040\ntradition we try to make it as far as we can without hearing this song. Also I\n\n47:46.040 --> 47:49.160\ndon't like but I heard it with my fucking Uber on the way over here.\n\n47:49.160 --> 47:54.800\nDuncan what is this song? Before we get to it there's another song Jingle Bell Rock\n\n47:54.800 --> 48:00.400\nthe line giddy up jingle horse makes me want to take my own life. Don't fucking\n\n48:00.400 --> 48:04.960\nsay giddy up jingle horse. Jingle horse isn't a fucking thing it's not an icon\n\n48:04.960 --> 48:09.520\nbut it's not an iconic Christmas thing. Jingle horse. Go fuck everybody that\n\n48:09.520 --> 48:14.120\never sang it and wrote it. More importantly can we all just go\n\n48:14.120 --> 48:19.400\ngo after this Harmontown and find Paul McCartney wherever he is and sing this on\n\n48:19.400 --> 48:25.440\nhis doorstep for 72 hours and make him because I walked into a shop when he\n\n48:25.440 --> 48:30.240\nasked us to go away we say why I was good enough for us I was yeah wasn't it\n\n48:30.240 --> 48:34.400\nwhen you wrote this song when you when you wrote down a cocktail napkin on the\n\n48:34.400 --> 48:39.280\nway to the studio the first Christmas Carol I heard because it was it was\n\n48:39.280 --> 48:43.160\nAugust you know I went to see a movie and they started the Christmas carols\n\n48:43.160 --> 48:48.000\nearly of course and the first one I heard I walked in and Duncan treat\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:54.800\nyourself to these rich majestic mythic literally like in the lyrics like he\n\n48:54.800 --> 49:00.840\nsays fuck it like almost almost like it you know fucking I fuck who gives a\n\n49:00.840 --> 49:19.960\nshit fuck it simply having cold out there's lights I don't know simply\n\n49:19.960 --> 49:40.560\nignoring the rules of show don't tell me the Christmas tree is great\n\n49:40.560 --> 49:51.640\nsimply simply yeah how about make it a little more complex I met a guy he was\n\n49:51.640 --> 50:19.120\nhad a moustache okay which feeling okay now what this is because there is a\n\n50:19.120 --> 50:28.120\ndark moment in the song it was it was it was it was it was composed by a kid\n\n50:28.120 --> 50:36.480\nshopping at Sears pressing demo buttons no you know it's I'm surprised green\n\n50:36.480 --> 50:41.200\nsleeves isn't in there somewhere on accident it sounds like what they\n\n50:41.200 --> 50:48.000\nblast to people in Guantanamo Bay this is

stepped it up a\n\n51:27.040 --> 51:30.480\ncouple times somebody needs to play that song backwards is anyone done that yeah\n\n51:30.480 --> 51:36.800\nyeah you get tomorrow never knows it's fucking about somebody that I know said\n\n51:36.800 --> 51:40.960\nthat they were on on a set with Ringo Starr and and they were like the crew was\n\n51:40.960 --> 51:44.480\nlike yeah we got Ringo Starr my favorite Beatles you know George Harrison my\n\n51:44.480 --> 51:47.600\nfavorite Beatles John Lennon and someone's like you know Paul McCartney\n\n51:47.600 --> 51:51.120\nlike a fucking guy like he

out of me out of our poly he goes he wrote a couple good ones too like\n\n52:04.440 --> 52:07.960\nlike like like whatever shit you talk about Paul McCartney you have to feel he\n\n52:07.960 --> 52:13.800\ndid fucking write a lot of fucking goodies now in high relief to the fucking\n\n52:13.800 --> 52:18.800\nbeautiful artwork that he made this happens\n\n52:22.320 --> 52:27.000\nthat's what they're kids if you're gonna go to a minor key it has to go to a\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:31.440\ndark place mythologically you have to say but it wasn't as we but can you back\n\n52:31.440 --> 52:35.080\nit up because I want everyone to hear the entire what the choir of children\n\n52:35.080 --> 52:45.480\nsing this is because there's three parts to it simply\n\n52:45.480 --> 52:48.960\nnothing simple\n\n52:48.960 --> 53:00.160\nchildren sing this song here's their song\n\n53:13.280 --> 53:18.520\nthe kids are as fucked up as McCartney like that I don't know he throws it

always given up on the song long before that happened we're usually\n\n54:10.160 --> 54:17.320\ndeep in conversation but I think he said he wants to lift a glass he doesn't\n\n54:17.320 --> 54:20.320\nknow how\n\n54:24.360 --> 54:41.400\ndon't look are we Santa no no now we're down the rabbit hole now I want my\n\n54:41.400 --> 54:50.280\nit was just plans for D-day or something no one

it like I say like it's all it's your\n\n55:23.960 --> 55:31.640\nplan throw some fucking man for Christmas yeah simply fulfilling a record\n\n55:31.640 --> 55:34.880\nlabel contractual agreement\n\n55:35.520 --> 55:41.200\nfuck him now Dan and now it was maybe two Christmases ago was the last year\n\n55:41.200 --> 55:44.720\nwas the last Christmas three three because it was the first time I kissed\n\n55:44.720 --> 55:50.240\nAaron I remember the night you're talking about because I know the next song\n\n55:50.240 --> 55:55.960\nyou want to play because I love as I think I don't know I just turned 40 I\n\n55:55.960 --> 56:03.720\ngrew up on the the peanuts Christmas specials and brilliantly they chose\n\n56:03.720 --> 56:08.040\nVince Garaldi trio to do all that music and it's like you don't have to like\n\n56:08.040 --> 56:12.880\njazz to love Vince Garaldi trio and and if you don't like jazz listen to Vince\n\n56:12.880 --> 56:18.160\nGaraldi trio and then at least dig him and and and the boys and the music in\n\n56:18.160 --> 56:22.760\nthe the peanut specials is really melancholy like it's really sad it's\n\n56:22.760 --> 56:27.760\nkind of blow your brains out darkness to it but it's also for me the\n\n56:27.760 --> 56:33.000\nChristmas like from like I have really fond Christmas memories I grew up in a\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:36.840\nnice small family and then everybody got along more or less and and Christmas was\n\n56:36.840 --> 56:41.560\nalways fun but the music is sad yeah Charles Schultz had to fight for the\n\n56:41.560 --> 56:47.240\ndarkness and the peanuts specials but we and what a good fight because the whole\n\n56:47.240 --> 56:51.920\npoint of it is it is solstice it's that like everything it's quiet and you put\n\n56:51.920 --> 56:55.800\nup an evergreen tree to convince yourself that the sun will come out tomorrow\n\n56:55.800 --> 57:00.600\nthere's an automatic bubblegum flavor to Christmas that yeah I think it's it's\n\n57:00.600 --> 57:05.560\nlike fun to overcome and counter with the natural like kind of stillness and\n\n57:05.560 --> 57:09.320\ndarkness because I love I'll be home for Christmas because I believe and I'm\n\n57:09.320 --> 57:12.800\nsure that somebody will prove me wrong on this one but as far as I know I'll be\n\n57:12.800 --> 57:16.920\nhome for Christmas was came out during World War two and it's whether it came\n\n57:16.920 --> 57:20.280\nup before that that was a big hit for the troops because the idea that I'll be\n\n57:20.280 --> 57:26.040\nhome if only in my dreams and families heard that song and it's really dark and\n\n57:26.040 --> 57:29.440\nit's the idea that like please have snow mistletoe and they bury the lead at the\n\n57:29.440 --> 57:34.120\nend like I won't be home for Christmas I might be in Italy I might be in in the\n\n57:34.120 --> 57:38.440\nArdennes I might be I'm not be cannon the Kaiser well that's the world war one\n\n57:38.440 --> 57:45.800\nokay I might be Rosie Rivendin but like like and what's the one you like Dan you\n\n57:45.800 --> 57:48.640\nhave your favorite I like that one which is the one that says through the years\n\n57:48.640 --> 57:53.160\nwe all will be together if the fates allow so it's that's it's a it's a\n\n57:53.160 --> 57:58.480\nsimilar thought but it doesn't tie you to military service like it's we are all\n\n57:58.480 --> 58:02.240\nin the military because we're all at war with an uncompromising fucking\n\n58:02.240 --> 58:08.120\nsometimes unpredictable jealous crazy God that like creates ice ages and and\n\n58:08.120 --> 58:13.280\nfreezes your crops and and and and and plays roller coaster with the infant\n\n58:13.280 --> 58:17.960\nmortality rate and and and and has viruses and good grasshoppers eat your\n\n58:17.960 --> 58:24.720\nface the the this this time of atonement with that in personal cosmic force you\n\n58:24.720 --> 58:28.400\nknow yeah going like like we're all we're all in that military service at\n\n58:28.400 --> 58:32.520\ngoing like I'll maybe I'll be you know make Christmas wait it's it's it's the\n\n58:32.520 --> 58:35.800\nhighest suicide rate of the year we all know that like is that true or is that\n\n58:35.800 --> 58:41.160\njust an urban myth that's from gremlins I mean that it is that's from\n\n58:41.160 --> 58:49.400\ngremlins Adam damn it Adam Adam go to bed\n\n58:50.120 --> 58:54.720\nwhat's your take on Adam Duncan like you even I gotta say man I thought it was\n\n58:54.720 --> 58:58.400\nvery sweet what he did when he came up here but what was he doing I don't even\n\n58:58.400 --> 59:01.440\nknow what he's doing I don't know if he was like a man about religion or he came\n\n59:01.440 --> 59:06.760\nup he came up to defend the the the god in Christmas yeah what's he doing that\n\n59:06.760 --> 59:19.960\nfor what am I doing what was it what you don't you don't just hang out with him\n\n59:19.960 --> 59:26.980\nin a hammock like God is it God isn't Superman he doesn't save us from train\n\n59:26.980 --> 59:33.040\ncrashes well that causes them to that's why you need that's why in Hinduism you\n\n59:33.040 --> 59:37.440\nneed a Shiva to make sense of the whole thing like in Christianity things get\n\n59:37.440 --> 59:41.920\nreally weird because you have this apparently all talk about I want to talk\n\n59:41.920 --> 59:48.200\nabout Adam Goldberg and what a dick he is because he only just wanted to come\n\n59:48.200 --> 59:52.040\non stage in order to come on stage he needed a point and his point needed to\n\n59:52.040 --> 59:56.960\nbe contrary to something else but it wasn't like it doesn't because on any\n\n59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.560\nother given day Adam would be coming up here reminding us that we should be\n\n01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:05.080\nskeptical of the Christian God because people got burnt at the stake and got\n\n01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:10.000\nleeches put on him you know that Adam's heart is three sizes too small he just I\n\n01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.360\nmean it like like at least don't don't don't lose the don't lose the moment like\n\n01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:18.560\na few if the if the stage is a big pink box with a red ribbon on it fucking\n\n01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:22.760\nopen it up and thank us for it like like let us get some pictures of you and\n\n01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:27.280\nyou and I agree with you I think that was that as motivation I think so Adam\n\n01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.480\nbut also I think you did come up with the idea that you were trying to defend\n\n01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:35.680\nstrangely Christmas but also I mean nobody up here was really trying to\n\n01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.000\ndefame Christmas I don't think I'm trying to bring that shit back\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.920\nDan you want to bring it back I'm saving Christmas up here can we can we bring\n\n01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.560\nit back with all song that we are good at first like because again like I said\n\n01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.280\nyeah we love the Vince Grawley trio so you all know this I'll play the vocal\n\n01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.160\nversion first so we all know this is the hardest we've ever laughed in our lives\n\n01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:59.040\nso let's just dig the original version first okay so we can hear the kids from\n\n01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:18.440\npeanuts sing it fuck you Paul McCartney this is a fucking good song\n\n01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:24.440\na really really happy beautiful lyrics set against the most minor dark beautiful\n\n01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:29.000\nmelancholic music of all time so what was the setup that we were just sitting\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:36.960\naround and I was in a good mood because I kind of had a crush on this on this\n\n01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:41.880\ngirl that was starting to hang around right and so I played the the instrumental\n\n01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:47.560\nversion so let's see if we can pull this off I think I started this and then we\n\n01:01:47.560 --> 01:02:03.120\ndid this for the next 30 minutes and we laughed for a three hour\n\n01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:27.920\nbecause we were giggling because you were singing Dixon balls and beer to the\n\n01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:33.720\nsong and then it was kind of giggling and just drunk and it was late and and then\n\n01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:43.680\nit was it was 3 p.m. well yeah compared to whenever we were we woke up the\n\n01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:51.720\nfire is warm the perfect storm that's when I lost it balls and beer are the\n\n01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.960\nperfect storm a Christmas time\n\n01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:04.200\nlike some tactician is looking at that on a piece of paper my god get out of\n\n01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:09.320\nhere there's gonna be dick's balls and beer at that party perfect store it's\n\n01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:22.960\nfucking Christmas weird thing for children to sing it's weirder than\n\n01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:31.480\ndick's balls and beer for children to be talking about the perfect storm you can't\n\n01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:37.640\nyou can't tell if the song is in favor of it or just a dire production some shit's\n\n01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.640\ngoing to go down tonight\n\n01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:47.480\nI was like one of the few the second third fourth times I met Erin and she\n\n01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:52.480\nshe came in the door and I was like I'm streaked with tears right now\n\n01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:57.480\nlisteners and we were in there and we were absolutely apoplectic we've been\n\n01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:03.440\ndoing this for an hour we kept doing it and there was many verses to it and\n\n01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:09.880\ngod damn it and she came in and we're like well it's a long story I went on a\n\n01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:13.160\nlittle walk with her that night and I remember the tree that we stopped by\n\n01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:16.760\noutside Dino's place and I kissed her for the first time but we didn't start\n\n01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:22.400\nmaking out or anything it was still I was I I leaned in and I kissed her and\n\n01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:26.500\nit was like I don't think I've ever had this experience where I just like she\n\n01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:31.280\njust accepted the kiss but nothing else happens and it was just sort of like\n\n01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:39.640\nlittle house in the prairie kind of like oh the courtship continues weird like we\n\n01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:45.080\nyeah you know a kiss usually like evolves into something but she was not\n\n01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:51.560\nshe was not ready but was not rebuffing and so it just we just continued to like\n\n01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:57.880\nwe had a little barrel hoop that we ran with a stick made her a crown out of\n\n01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:05.480\ndaisies or something I went went went to read the Bible to my blind grandpa and\n\n01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:11.200\nthen I fucked her deep\n\n01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:21.800\nand she found it all right let's have a special Christmas meeting with the real\n\n01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:31.520\nthe actual father of winter the embodiment of the solstice the the Nordic\n\n01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:39.880\ntraveling cold cold cold immune

that's a good lyric yeah like there's what is there\n\n01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:52.840\nmore to that song which I kind of like I change when I get up here get a mic this\n\n01:06:52.840 --> 01:07:02.760\nis too good if you like ladies and gentlemen Sean Connery\n\n01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:09.440\nthank you so the original version of that song as it was written by whoever\n\n01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:14.600\nSammy Conner whoever wrote it out here through the years we all be together if\n\n01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:19.400\nthe fates allow until then we'll have to muddle through somehow mmm you know\n\n01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:23.520\nmelancholy oh and they change it to hang a shining star up on the high as well\n\n01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:30.400\nthat's a non-secret in your version so yeah wow yeah the hang a shining star\n\n01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.320\nmakes no sense no it's a non-secret I'd be curious to know because I thought maybe\n\n01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:38.720\nSammy Conner one of those one of those great like yeah yeah but like what year\n\n01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.680\nit would be if that were a depression error or something like that because or\n\n01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:48.160\nprobably later than that 40s 40s yeah so but and I don't know exactly when that\n\n01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:53.400\nchange happened I do know that I mean it's but it might be the coolest thing\n\n01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:58.040\nin the world but it's hard to imagine singing that that original lyric in the\n\n01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.440\nway that traditionally you do because if that's that's the point where you\n\n01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:06.880\nreally swell hang a shining star you go crazy you go for it and bring it home\n\n01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:12.480\nwell the but the Ella

01:08:19.800\nshe does a version of it it's but she does the muddle through one or the yeah\n\n01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.760\nshe does the muddle through yes I've heard that but I think Sinatra does it\n\n01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:28.800\nwell yeah I think that's I don't think I have it on here I got a lot of the old stuff that's that's a goodie yeah\n\n01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:33.840\nall right

hands\n\n01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:34.800\nare gone man just a scuttling sound a distant shriek and let BuzzFeed's 25\n\n01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:41.520\nreasons Dan Harmon was interesting yeah be the last you ever hear of that was\n\n01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:47.880\nfast that was fast that was like like new zombie you speed like I was driving\n\n01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:52.640\nthrough an intersection with Schrab once we were like on Highland and Melrose I\n\n01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:59.720\nthink and and this fucking SUV I looked up and there was an SUV coming full\n\n01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:05.320\nspeed that did not say I think we were we were going straight and the SUV was\n\n01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:11.240\nmaking a left turn we had the but and so and so you know like he was we were\n\n01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.640\ngoing straight we had the right of way and this SUV just decided to continue\n\n01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:20.160\nits left turn and and so just we're in the middle of a conversation about Gary\n\n01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:25.680\nShandling or something and and then we were going to die yeah because we were\n\n01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:32.360\ngoing 35 45 miles an hour and and and he so was he and somehow Schrab just went\n\n01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:38.240\njust cranked the wheel all the way and the end result was just somehow I swear\n\n01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:43.040\nlike molecules of the paint on the gun the respective cars must have must have\n\n01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:47.400\nrushed up against each other like but nothing other than it happened it was\n\n01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:51.280\njust like that it was just profound because that that's oh that's what it\n\n01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:55.800\nfeels like to die except for the very end part yeah which is you dying like\n\n01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:03.320\nthat's that's what you see when when in this life is taken away from you it's\n\n01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:06.800\nnothing just garbage just nothing just an Adam

guy\n\n01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:22.520\naround the holidays I mean I like the idea of it but I'm more of a grump\n\n01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:27.120\naround the holidays it's about unfulfilled expectations for me so yeah\n\n01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:32.880\nbut you get to do that that's fun well I get to well no because people are like\n\n01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:37.400\nwell Christmas has never been the same ever since my dad lost his leg it's\n\n01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:41.440\nlike yeah my parents got me a hello kitty digital camera one time I know you\n\n01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:48.040\nfeel what did they really yeah yeah it was that was yeah it would have been\n\n01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.680\nbetter if it was a digital camera that was like worth half a crap but if it's\n\n01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:56.120\nsomething you get for like $15 like the novelty value isn't even worth the\n\n01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:01.640\nutility you know it's not even a joke was that the beginning of the end of\n\n01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:07.200\nyour like if your dashed hopes around the holiday no that was the the lash on the\n\n01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:12.760\ndead horse like I was like okay fuck it I'm gonna make my own happiness which I\n\n01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:15.720\nshould have carried on the rest of my life because I only do that for\n\n01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:19.360\nChristmas is making my only happiness apparently how do you do that now I just\n\n01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:25.560\nget myself the stuff I want and I tell everybody else to go fuck themselves\n\n01:16:25.560 -->

a hallucination but crossing the street was\n\n01:17:51.360 --> 01:18:00.440\na giant mushroom even even we're even weirder even weirder crossing the street\n\n01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:10.640\nwas like a little you know a little buggy with a goat pulling it and a little\n\n01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:17.840\nperson riding in the buggy I still wonder did I dream it was it but I saw it I\n\n01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:22.440\nsaw it quickly went across the street crossing at the crosswalk it was no it\n\n01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:27.280\nwasn't a crosswalk it was just I was like coming down from Fairfax I don't\n\n01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:31.400\nknow where it was a boat and a little person it was a goat pulling a little\n\n01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:36.600\nbuggy with a little person in it was he was the little person doing this\n\n01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:42.320\nvoluntarily was the guy was the little person who was clearly set about this\n\n01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:45.960\narrangement no no there was

merging of dimensions or something like this what sort of goat\n\n01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.600\nthose big those big goats or a little little mini-goats it was enough of a\n\n01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:04.280\ngoat to pull a buggy with a dwarf in it but but also to find buggy because\n\n01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:07.720\nthat's the other thing like a little it almost looked like a baby carriage it\n\n01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:12.760\nwas very gothy man it looked like a goth look baby carriage it was creepy now I\n\n01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:19.040\nnow I'm saying this and I feel like am I lying

attacked from the inside on\n\n01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:03.840\nwhat he could swear was a heart Mulraine attempted to melt the metal monster\n\n01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:09.200\nsteel skin with their blazing armor after their individual attempts failed the\n\n01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:13.840\nheroes outside the golem began attacking the head and unison sawing and\n\n01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:19.200\ncleaving at its neck in true decapitated fashion meanwhile Sharpie and\n\n01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:23.600\nAvenger cracked wise and shrunk the glowing red heart node before diving\n\n01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.880\ninto two holes that were revealed to be the golems legs down there they spied\n\n01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:33.520\nglowing stones and Sharpie shrunk one because he was on a roll shrinking\n\n01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:39.680\nstuff and it caused the golem to shudder and the stones glow to dim it seemed as\n\n01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:56.800\nif it was just a matter of time until the golem was disassembled that's all so you\n\n01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:03.960\nguys know what to do now no no no why would they that doesn't matter where my\n\n01:32:03.960 -->

its sponsor dealing you're not dealing damage in this case\n\n01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:30.480\nbut you share the final bits of metal off this thing's head its head falls off\n\n01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:52.600\nand the head is off and that's enough what's in his neck yeah what's in his\n\n01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:57.320\nneck we look at his neck you see a floating glowing stone it's glowing with\n\n01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:03.360\nthe a topaz I yell down ironically and sarcastically to Sharpie it looks like\n\n01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:11.880\nit's heart you're down enough to grab that topaz thing I scramble up I mean\n\n01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:16.120\nwhat do I perceive what do I know you're in a foot so when the head came off you\n\n01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:20.760\ncould hear the shearing of metal and then like a shaft of light kind of going\n\n01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:28.840\ninto the into the the neck hole there I vomit on the thing you sure do I put my\n\n01:34:28.840 -->

01:37:30.760\nhole yeah yeah is it within reach like it's brain I know how much you hate it\n\n01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:35.080\nwhen I try to get well why would the brain be in his neck hole yeah why well\n\n01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:38.960\nbecause his head's off now but this thing remains yeah it's floating mid-neck\n\n01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:44.560\nhole yeah mid-neck hole could be his Adam's apple where is it or down in the\n\n01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:48.840\nknow like right right at the neck collar yeah guys I think it's the carotid\n\n01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:57.720\namethyst it's a topaz if I know my golem right so you are you up out out of\n\n01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:02.440\nthe neck yeah I'm up in the neck area you burst forth I'd like to touch this\n\n01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:07.640\ntopaz vomit right that was your question um the whole the this hole is\n\n01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:11.840\nabout a five foot radius so you'd have to stretch like pretty pretty far to\n\n01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:16.560\nreach that thing I extend him a hand and let him lean out so he can touch the\n\n01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:23.280\ntopaz all right unless I cast I don't have it why don't you just cast teamwork\n\n01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:29.240\nfine the greatest spell of all\n\n01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:38.640\nanyway working together you manage to reach out and grasp this this is a power\n\n01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:44.360\ncrystal of some sort you grab it it feels like it's being held in place with\n\n01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:48.000\nlike a magnetic kind of force but as you grab it it kind of goes away like it\n\n01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:53.200\nwon't you know get stuck there how big is this thing like a pretty small like\n\n01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:56.920\nmaybe the size of an eyeball oh he puked on it but it's the size of an eye yeah\n\n01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:00.320\nthat's why it didn't like yeah he only puked on it with a little bit of you the\n\n01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:05.400\nrest of it was free to splatter a human eyeball right you shrunk it different\n\n01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:13.040\ndifferent thing not the heart not the heart topaz so this is the gong is the\n\n01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:17.560\ngong moving still or is it doing while we do this to it I mean this hasn't\n\n01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:22.960\ntaken too long I guess vomiting inducing vomiting is only a few seconds true it's\n\n01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:28.760\nbeen a bit momentarily stunned by by the loss of its head you don't it hasn't\n\n01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:36.080\nstarted moving since this fuck up those topaz man yeah can we just grab the\n\n01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:40.560\ntopaz and throw it throw it away he grabbed it so you're you've grabbed it\n\n01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:44.440\nholding on to it is like holding my weight or no no that's the thing oh I\n\n01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:49.840\ngot it yeah you got it I put it back in not to the shoulder area I put it in my\n\n01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:55.240\npocket okay that happens you pull each other in and you pocket the thing is the\n\n01:39:55.240 --> 01:40:01.640\ngong so moving it is so it hasn't moved since being decapitated that's that's\n\n01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:06.400\nfunny over here come on no no nothing nothing are you simply having a\n\n01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:11.280\nwonderful Christmas time yeah I just think it's fine yeah I I climbed down in\n\n01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:14.800\nhis back like is he wearing clothing of some sort as it was skin or what's what\n\n01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:19.800\nhe's got like metal metal shell wearing a ladder\n\n01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:26.800\nno well now we know yeah it's a great question I slide down this back and\n\n01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:29.840\ngrab like grab around the waist and just kind of like as a joke kind of look up\n\n01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:36.760\nit's that kind of dry humping him from behind yeah yeah I get I get out of it\n\n01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:42.520\nand I so now am I in the the keep the where we fought Admiral Darkstar am I\n\n01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:47.280\nyep the level right before the level you were yeah this is the level with all\n\n01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:51.640\nthose bodies I guess all the blood buckets yeah I walk over to a window and\n\n01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:58.640\nI look out of it you do that you can see just like snow and whiteness it's no\n\n01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:06.720\nyeah can I climb down and push the goal golem over yeah wait wait wait I'm\n\n01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:12.680\nstill up here oh I'm sorry come down let's go down together okay okay you walk\n\n01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:16.480\ndown together I stay on I stay on if I want to be on him when he goes over\n\n01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:21.120\nbecause I'm still fucking him you push one ankle I'll push the other so we\n\n01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:26.280\npush over the golem in unison you push the golems ankles and at first it\n\n01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:32.280\nbegins to creak and then totter a bit maybe and then topple in fact topple\n\n01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:40.800\nover in a pile of clanging clanging metal happens happens okay I touch the\n\n01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:45.200\nfrosted glass at the window I'm standing in as I look out at the fresh new\n\n01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:52.960\nfallen snow and I think about family and I think about a little baby born in a\n\n01:41:52.960 --> 01:42:05.960\nmanger I start telling everybody how Christmas comes from mushrooms you make\n\n01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:15.760\nseveral cogent points I examine I examine the room for doors other ways of\n\n01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:22.240\negress the only way through this door is a large metal hatch in the floor I\n\n01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:28.240\nexamine it it's a large and metal Chris de Burgh you're a rogue you're good at\n\n01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:34.720\ndoors get over here and try to open this thing okay I go over to the door and I\n\n01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:42.160\nvomit on it I don't know why wait wait wait wait wait see where he's going with\n\n01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:54.360\nit does it sizzle no I use it's the only way I know I hate to come to your\n\n01:42:54.360 --> 01:43:03.640\nhouse man for you don't want me to cook for you man hey don't get the door I\n\n01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:11.600\nthink my grandmother's coming let the dog out okay I'm expecting a package\n\n01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:20.360\nno no I use what I use my thieving skills to analyze the door to make sure\n\n01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:25.360\nit's not trapped or to see if they if it's a trap door nice certainly not\n\n01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:30.160\ntrapped although you're not quite sure how it opens there's got to be stuff\n\n01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:35.040\nyou'd say when you were investigating and examining this door it seems like a\n\n01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:39.880\nclassic big heavy metal door it doesn't appear to be trapped as many of the\n\n01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:49.120\ndoors that I've seen before the door is fine everybody let's pull it up grab it\n\n01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:56.080\ngrab that door so we I try to pull the door up you try but you fail it it seems\n\n01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:02.240\nlike it's some sort of sliding rather than a swinging actuating hinge like the\n\n01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:08.920\ndoor I slide the door you slide the door and below it you see only lava I\n\n01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:16.960\npuke on it yeah it's sizzles we you enter the hot lava is it hot yeah yeah\n\n01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:25.040\nvery okay good now we know I told you guys yeah puke sizzles when I'm on\n\n01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:33.240\nyour side so we beat Admiral Darkstar and we beat him we came to his place we\n\n01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:37.280\nkicked his ass we're done right we're walking around we're looking through\n\n01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:44.120\nlava doors but the truth is we beat this guy one we you want to celebrate well I\n\n01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:50.080\nknow I'm just saying like like what if we just said to you three weeks later no\n\n01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:59.400\nthey were all found dead I guess we do have to make our way out of this\n\n01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:02.640\nbuilding fine well it just seems like a little expensive the only way out of\n\n01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:06.640\nthis building is the lava door on the floor are there any lava boats no\n\n01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:11.640\nthere's no lava boats yeah the only other thing is a staircase but it goes\n\n01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:15.960\nup ways it doesn't go down ways I go up the staircase and check it out I go up\n\n01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:19.960\nthat's that that floor where you saw Admiral Darkstar there's a dark pillar\n\n01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:26.080\nof black blackened crystal and big hole on the floor where that robot arm came\n\n01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:31.040\nout yeah so what else are we sure Admiral Darkstar is dead I mean who's sure of\n\n01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:35.840\nanything man I don't think he's right I don't think he's dead I think this is\n\n01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:39.120\nonly one way to find out\n\n01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:49.040\nis there a body there's no other no other there's no windows doors in this\n\n01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:54.680\nroom there's just stairs windows yeah there's snow outside yeah well so you\n\n01:45:54.680 --> 01:46:01.720\njust can we go through the window and and down into the snow you try no no\n\n01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:07.720\nthere isn't is there a servant of the floor land conscious I mean I run over\n\n01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:12.520\nto a possible unconscious servant tonight rouse him or her wait why do you rouse\n\n01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:20.680\nwait well you're gonna wake him up right away let's puke on him yeah yeah I\n\n01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:25.120\nwant to I want to go over to one of these windows how far down is it outside it's\n\n01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:33.400\nseveral hundred feet how about how much feather I have 150 feet of rope it says\n\n01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:37.400\non here yeah so we can use the rope to climb down are we trying to get out of\n\n01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:45.760\nhere that's my instinct so we push I take the servants unconscious body and I\n\n01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:51.680\npush him out of the window you don't see the servant there's no sir no there is\n\n01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:59.320\nno servant sir there there certainly was he's gone I mean yeah people move it's\n\n01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:04.560\ncrazy and jump through the window and cast feather fall all right that happens\n\n01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:10.480\nnow I climb down I have a hundred feet of rope and I tie it out to you great\n\n01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:14.640\nyou're the only source of casting feather fall on people and you're the\n\n01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:21.960\nfirst one out the door oh I can I can cast on them the guy who builds parachutes\n\n01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:24.960\nI didn't know I can even cast it on other people\n\n01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:29.720\nhey yeah okay we're good together Chris de Burgh so Sharpie the rope bring him\n\n01:47:29.720 -->

several\n\n01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:43.160\nhundred feet well I've got one hundred and I have a hundred fifty feet we tie\n\n01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:46.720\nthe rope let's just get Sharpie back up here make him build us magic parachutes\n\n01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:51.560\nwell I gotta climb up oh but he's open then your role yeah we don't have enough\n\n01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:55.120\nrope to even get him back up here well he's feather falling he's not falling\n\n01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:59.400\ntoo fast I make a lasso and I throw I throw it down to catch him as he\n\n01:47:59.400 -->

don't\n\n01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:15.480\nit's like fuck it yeah I catch it thank you so we pull him back up because\n\n01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:20.840\nhe's got a cat's feather falling he feels as light as a feather so we pull\n\n01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:25.840\nhim pull him up back to that I don't want to go back up I come up for two\n\n01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:30.560\nseconds and you're the guy that
