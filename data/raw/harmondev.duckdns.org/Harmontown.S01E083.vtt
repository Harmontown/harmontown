00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Saryl Audio

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
Save it! Save it!

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
No, don't save it. Let your freak flags

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
fly, you guys.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Ha ha ha!

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
I love those J-I-M-G-L-E bells

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Oh!

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
This is my favorite Christmas Carol growing up

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Frank Sinatra, this vinyl record. For me, this song

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
is the very, very meaning of Christmas.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
I mean, we've all heard J-I-M-G-L-E bells, but

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
dig this shit.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
Welcome, one and all, to a very special

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Harmontown. For the very last time in the year of our lord

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
in 2013, Harmontown is now in session.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
Once you welcome to the stage

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
the reason for the season, the mayor of

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Happy New Year.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Hello.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah. Happy New Year.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
It's a holiday special, Jeff.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
It's a cavalcade of holiday celebration.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
We're going to have countdowns and years in review.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm ballad sung by children. At one point the entire

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
room is slightly flooded than frozen and we all skate out to the parking lot.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Special Christmas wishes, dances

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
a little Christmas wrap.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
And then a very heartwarming poem that you improvised at the very end.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
And gifts. Gifts for everybody.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
We'll figure it out.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
This would be a good time for a beef steak bill to step into action

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
and bring him back full of goodies.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
I think it must be said that

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Oh god damn it. Forgotten your name.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Anatoly has dressed up like some sort of weird cross between

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
St. Nick and Krampus.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Anatoly, get on stage. Everybody Instagram the shit out of this right now.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
I mean

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
What in the gay porn is going on up here?

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Anatoly wearing a

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
kind of a... As Adam Goldberg

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
properly says, he is Anatoly correct.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
He's wearing a red Santa Tuk and little short shorts

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
red in some Ugg boots.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
He's really ready for Santa Monica Boulevard at any moment.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
Anatoly, is this your way of saying that it's colder in Russia?

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
Are you being kind of like home sick and going like

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
fuck you weather pussies. Yeah, fuck you almost differently.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
You seem to be engaged

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
in your Soviet given right to intoxication

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
as usual.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Some kind of red here.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Merry Christmas. Anatoly.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
I won't accept it.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
You're committing to the whole atheist thing in Russia still?

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
Well, I mean we have just different kind of Christmas.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
There's one like no one cares about which

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
who cares about Christmas? No one. What is it? What's the Russian Christmas?

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
We celebrate Christmas on like old wrong calendar

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
so it's like we celebrate Christmas on

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
January 7th and it's like mostly religious holidays

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
so most people don't care about it. They just

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
drink and eat.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Is it a winter solstice thing? It's honoring the end of the year? No, no. We have

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
New Year for this. New Year in Russia

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
has got to be pretty intense. Yeah, New Year is basically a knuckle from

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
European Christmas. It's how it's like

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
origins of Russian New Year. They like stole Christmas

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
from Europe and change Santa Claus to the great

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
guy who is way better than Santa Claus. What's his name?

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
His name is in Russian it death morose.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Death morose? Oh, that's great. I mean that can be great.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Death morose. And it's mean like...

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
In Soviet Russia year ends you.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
I don't remember Soviet part of Russia.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
I know, I know. You're post-Yakov Smirnov generation. You don't know.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
You don't even know what that is. I barely know what that is.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
What part of the Russian holiday tradition brought to mind

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
coming to Harmontown nearly naked?

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
I mean it's like after your

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
drugs you have to be naked.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
After drugs you have to be naked.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
Are you on ecstasy right now or mushrooms or what's going on?

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
It might or might not be.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
On ecstasy? Yes. That sounds like a resounding da.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
So are you giving a lot of back rubs,

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
grinding your teeth and promising to call people more often?

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Or has ecstasy changed

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
since I was 25?

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
No, I think I took some MDMA

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
in...where was I?

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
I can't remember.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
But it's been years since I did anything interesting.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
So you're kind of lame now? I'm kind of lame.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Are you afraid to do hallucinogenic drugs again then?

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Sometime around your first mortgage payment

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
you take on the sometime way before your first mortgage payment.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
Your first mortgage payment is on even too much marijuana.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
I have to be very careful even smoking pot or I'll get very...

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
My freak out threshold is very low.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
I'll start panicking. I guess that's what they mean by paranoia.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
I never realized it until I realized it.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Paranoid about why am I getting high, I'm too old to be getting high, and all this weird shit happens to me.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
Because I'm outside of God's

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
step, I'm out of rhythm and out of the moment

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
and making money and being grown up and that's been going on since I was like...

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Is your concern, Dan, at your age right now, that if you did hallucinogens you might come to

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Harmontown wearing red short shorts?

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
I would love to think that I had it in me.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
I've always thought of you as kind of a shy fellow. Even though you sit in the front row and you are willing to get up on stage,

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
you seem kind of reserved to yourself.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
This is a very different side of you.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
I just don't like to talk but I don't have a mic in my hand.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
Look, I'll have what you're having, man.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
Who is your dealer?

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
I mean, would it be strange if I

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
will say that I'm like 100 drug free?

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
What? 100 drug free?

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
100% right? It's supposed to be 100%.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
You're not 100% drug free.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
But I kind of am.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
You can't be kind of 100%.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
You're something to the gills.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Are you high on life?

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
Is it like a stupid expression?

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Stupid?

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
Maybe you're just really in a good mood and that moves you to do that.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
I was differently in a pretty good mood.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
You have almost identical shoulder and back hair patterns to me.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
However, I am, as Darth Vader said to Luke, it is too late for me.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
Take your shirt off.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
I think we owe it to the live audience.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
You notice that three people clap.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Not that it's my fantasy that everyone...

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
Even the freak show element of it, people are like,

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
I don't want to see it.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
Well, Anatoly, I'll give you two choices.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
You can take a seat now, enjoy the rest of the show,

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
or you can stay up here as Russian Santa Claus.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
I do want to know what does it mean.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
It means, like, Grandpa Frost.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Grandpa Frost?

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
Does Grandpa Frost grant wishes? Does he help people achieve what they want in the new year?

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
Yes, pretty much. He does everything the same as Santa Claus.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
Except he isn't fat.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
Because he isn't American.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
Wow. The Cold War just got colder.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
That was the last...

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Well, the shot heard round the kitchenette.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
I mean, Santa Claus isn't definitely American,

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
so that doesn't make any sense.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
Right. I mean, we kind of Americanized him.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
I think we took ownership of that.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Green until Coca-Cola co-opted that.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Is that true or is that an urban legend?

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
I believe that's true. Coca-Cola is the reason why he's been branded as a guy that was red and white.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
Makes sense to me. I don't know. I don't care.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
I think people are too sardonic about Christmas

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
because the truth is that it's...

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
whatever you're celebrating at this time of year,

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
what you're really celebrating is the solstice. You're really celebrating the fact that the days

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
are about to get the shortest that they'll ever get before slowly

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
starting to become longer again. And, you know, old cavemen,

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
when young cavemen,

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
I believe, I think that they were conscious of how long the

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
days were and how long the nights were. And I think that this time of year

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
has a global condition of mankind, like everyone

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
all over the place at this time of year. If you have a winter and you have

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
this sort of solstice where it's sort of ingrained in us

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
culturally to celebrate the death of the year

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
and ask ourselves what that means and then you cycle this beginning

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
and stuff. And there's a really matter that, like, I mean,

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
you got your people who stamped their little feet about how Christianity co-opted

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
this time of year. You got your people that stamped their feet about

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
the war on Christmas and trying to politically correctify everything.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
It's all kind of, I think those people just like choosing this time

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
of year to be unhappy and I think that you get to spend this time of year doing

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
whatever you want. It's a little fantasy time. Dan, do you love Christmas? I do.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
I really like it because it's something that you mark

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
it's a time I'm plotting my bravery.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
It's a bold stance this time of year.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
It's a very bold stance. It's probably not fashionable

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
and I don't like the only thing that I like about it is just the fact that it is.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
That it happens once a year. That's it. That doesn't really...

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
But Valentine's Day happens once a year and you don't give a fuck about that, probably.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
Yeah, you're right. It's got little trade marks to it.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
It's like the Christmas lights go up at the bar. I think that's the thing that I really like

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
is like these dive bars

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
that put up Christmas lights. If you're not from here, or if you are, and if you haven't been,

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
in that water village. And it's a little dumpy dive bar like the drawing room.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
But around Christmas time, they put up really good Christmas lights

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
and they make eggnog that will wipe you out. It's got three

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
kinds of booze in it. Go to the roost tonight or soon before

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
New Year's and that's a good Christmas thing and a very good jukebox

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
as well. Alright, Russian Santa Claus, we're going to give you an elf now.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
We're going to provide you with a Russian elf.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
It doesn't have elves.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
I mean, I can have one.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
In the spirit of Perestroika, please, let's meet each other halfway.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
Yes, this is a Christmas miracle that's happening right now. We have a

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
semi-naked Russian Santa Claus or Death Morose up here.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
Alright, let's bring out Duncan Tressel, our friend.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
This is Anatoly's.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
This is a mic under you.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
So it's a... It's a beard fest. Beard fest!

13:52.000 --> 14:04.180
okay so thank you for coming Duncan my car was parked outside your house cuz I

14:04.180 --> 14:07.620

14:07.620 --> 14:14.540
tonight yeah thank you for coming you ripped me away from an Xbox one that I

14:14.540 --> 14:20.300
just bought yeah that's friendship that's friendship don't boo him for coming

14:20.300 --> 14:32.360
to the show is it bad to buy an Xbox one are they are they good I don't know

14:32.360 --> 14:36.960
I don't know I just but aren't you scared you're getting monitored the whole

14:36.960 --> 14:45.600
time by the connect control I don't want to have to unplug a camera that's

14:45.600 --> 14:59.760
watching me all the time what did Anatoly say I don't know I don't know

14:59.760 --> 15:08.160
what he says he said don't you like to be looked at oh it's it's it's it's it's

15:08.160 --> 15:13.200
comforting for them like it makes them feel like they're alive to be monitored

15:13.200 --> 15:18.320
Duncan do you have a do you have any special Christmas memories Christmas

15:18.320 --> 15:24.240
memories for better or for worse oh man can you think about one while I

15:24.240 --> 15:30.760
complain about something yes okay it's more of a rhetorical question than a

15:30.760 --> 15:40.600
complaint if you're writing if you're if you're a TV critic and and and I think

15:40.600 --> 15:44.880
all TV critics are great wonderful misunderstood people who should all be

15:44.880 --> 15:52.160
appreciated as long as they're writing a network television reviews of networks

15:52.160 --> 15:57.920
sitcoms those people are great the but I have a question for the TV critics who

15:57.920 --> 16:04.680
do reviews of SNL episodes which I didn't remember where they where they

16:04.680 --> 16:11.520
review each sketch and talk about what whether or not it was funny yeah am I

16:11.520 --> 16:18.400
supposed to read that before I watch the comedy sketch or after and in either

16:18.400 --> 16:24.800
case dumb like what what kind of life are we supposed to be living I like that

16:24.800 --> 16:34.200
comedy sketch mr. farts huh that's funny farted I wonder what Joe Johnson had to

16:34.200 --> 16:41.680
say he he didn't think the farts were funny it's a little insane isn't it

16:41.680 --> 16:46.400
yeah and here's the even weirder thing I wonder what Joe Johnson recommends huh

16:46.400 --> 16:53.520
looks like they did a fart sketch on SNL I think I'll read about it seems like

16:53.520 --> 16:58.680
the farts came fast and plenty and overall it was no cone heads but a good

16:58.680 --> 17:07.440
time was hats I'm gonna give that sketch a look see Joe Johnson was right

17:07.440 --> 17:15.480
again I consumed a sketch using the navigation system of a professional

17:15.480 --> 17:20.640
sketch reviewer how do you take three minutes to watch the fucking sketch and

17:20.640 --> 17:23.720
somebody's got a five paragraph theme about it how did you come across this

17:23.720 --> 17:28.640
reviewer I just I don't know I saw a thing that I clicked a link in it

17:28.640 --> 17:34.400
I just I was like what is that really a thing but you know what I feel about that

17:34.400 --> 17:38.000
the SNL reviewer I feel the exact same way that I feel about the guy who has to

17:38.000 --> 17:45.120
watch people playing Xbox at the NSA it's like you're getting it's like instant

17:45.120 --> 17:49.560
karma you're getting what you deserve you have to watch SNL sketches

17:49.560 --> 17:55.480
professionally you have to watch like mildly overweight guys laying on their

17:55.480 --> 18:01.600
couch yeah vanishing into oblivion event have a report on somebody's desk at 10

18:01.600 --> 18:07.720
a.m. yeah yeah yeah people are still at Steve Mitchell picked his nose and ate

18:07.720 --> 18:14.240
it yeah exactly that's what happened I'm not hip to this so they watch you play

18:14.240 --> 18:18.560
Xbox in the event that what that you're good at doing like they have the monkey

18:18.560 --> 18:21.880
bars like a like a it's just it's just biometrics you're being monitored now

18:21.880 --> 18:25.520
they have cameras on these things are really cool I went to Comic Con and

18:25.520 --> 18:31.320
they showed Justin and I the Xbox one when we did a Xbox interview for their

18:31.320 --> 18:35.400
little channel and they took us behind a curtain and fired one of these things

18:35.400 --> 18:39.760
up and it was looking at my skeleton I mean not even not my skeleton but it

18:39.760 --> 18:44.440
was it put a skeleton over my body because it could recognize my body and

18:44.440 --> 18:48.920
know where each of my knuckles were and my and also Justin standing next to me

18:48.920 --> 18:53.280
and we were like dancing around and it knew and it and then I started I was

18:53.280 --> 18:56.520
laughing the whole time because it was amazing and then I started noticing that

18:56.520 --> 19:02.360
when I smiled it said that I was happy next to my head yeah and so the the the

19:02.360 --> 19:09.360
the the Nielsen evolution of this system is kind of obvious that you know no

19:09.360 --> 19:13.840
longer need people to crank a dial in order to test a TV show ostensibly

19:13.840 --> 19:20.520
our entertainment will be in the hands of people who are are so weird that they

19:20.520 --> 19:23.440
actually smile when they enjoy themselves in their privacy of their

19:23.440 --> 19:28.960
living room while watching a National Geographic show but to the extent that

19:28.960 --> 19:33.120
that doesn't happen everything on National Geographical could cancel but

19:33.120 --> 19:37.040
you can stream you know like there's something called Twitch where you can

19:37.040 --> 19:40.760
stream playing a game like you can stream playing a game and also I guess

19:40.760 --> 19:45.360
it films you playing too so like there's already been bad accidents where

19:45.360 --> 19:50.840
someone left that on and and that filmed him and his wife was passed out and it

19:50.840 --> 19:58.360
like filmed him rubbing her pussy oh yeah oh really oh I see it was on purpose

19:58.360 --> 20:03.160
yeah I didn't know that I thought he didn't know he's being monitored rubbing

20:03.160 --> 20:11.240
bus pussy part Russian Santa Claus what are you doing here

20:11.240 --> 20:15.240
were you were you were you watching us did someone mention the Russian Santa

20:15.240 --> 20:23.360
Claus equivalent of a plate of milk and cookies I believe in Russia they leave

20:23.360 --> 20:35.360
out a yeah wait so wait wait so a guy rubbed it rubbed his wife's pussy on

20:35.360 --> 20:41.040
camera to make it like as though he was doing with something bad well there's

20:41.040 --> 20:44.040
actually you remember chat roulette I mean it's like like chat roulette very

20:44.040 --> 20:49.080
quickly became everyone's got their dick out because there's like yeah that's

20:49.080 --> 20:51.760
really that's like that's like those people are the opposite of me like the

20:51.760 --> 20:55.800
idea that you want to that like the people who want to nothing nothing

20:55.800 --> 20:59.120
against them I'm whatever whatever floats your boat well I mean unless you're

20:59.120 --> 21:02.680
victimizing people but but but which which these people sometimes often do

21:02.680 --> 21:08.240
because they need to be like seen jerking off and all this stuff that's like so

21:08.240 --> 21:13.240
the opposite of me like I'm so sex is too intimate for me I just really boy I

21:13.240 --> 21:18.760
wish I could just hide from my partner yeah I know what you mean yeah I do

21:18.760 --> 21:23.160
Doug Stanhope has a really funny joke about how like you know when you watch

21:23.160 --> 21:28.360
porn if for those of you watch porn like there's the porn where the camera

21:28.360 --> 21:32.040
guy will start talking and it always sucks because he's like oh yeah you're

21:32.040 --> 21:35.560
so hot and it's like you just want to hear this lazy guy talking you just want

21:35.560 --> 21:40.680
there to be this kind of sacred silence when this thing is happening but you

21:40.680 --> 21:44.800
were talking about Instagram now has become a this this thing you're starting

21:44.800 --> 21:49.840
to go down well Instagram is like a yet Instagram is the kind of like you can

21:49.840 --> 21:54.960
chat on Instagram now they just added that they open the floodgates yeah it's

21:54.960 --> 22:00.880
really it's a danger it's a this is Dustin Dustin's fault for showing me this

22:00.880 --> 22:06.480
I was fine and then he like tied my mating impulses in with Instagram and I

22:06.480 --> 22:10.960
can't staring at the fucking rectangle so take me through how that works like

22:10.960 --> 22:15.320
you're on Instagram and you see a do you see a girl's pictures you took a selfie

22:15.320 --> 22:19.520
as you kids call us and and you like the way she looks and now you can send her

22:19.520 --> 22:23.200
a message which you couldn't do before right yeah so what happens is now what

22:23.200 --> 22:28.000
happens is very attractive people very attractive girls they have this instant

22:28.000 --> 22:32.880
way to melt dopamine out of their brains which is they just take a picture of

22:32.880 --> 22:37.120
themselves and put it on Instagram and then thousands of people like the

22:37.120 --> 22:42.200
picture and that keeps that that makes them feel like they are connected to

22:42.200 --> 22:45.560
the universe and that they're alive or something but that was how Instagram

22:45.560 --> 22:48.400
always has been you could you post a photo people like it what's what's the

22:48.400 --> 22:51.400
new thing with the check now you can contact people right yeah now you can

22:51.400 --> 22:54.680
send people like you'd say hello to people and stuff and then they can write

22:54.680 --> 22:59.680
you back and then that pulls you into like a darker vortex of community and

22:59.680 --> 23:04.920
you can send a private photo obviously you can yeah since Dustin taught me this

23:04.920 --> 23:09.440
thing about Instagram I have felt like I was gonna be murdered four times like I

23:09.440 --> 23:14.800
felt like honestly in danger and cat you said it's combining Instagram with your

23:14.800 --> 23:18.320
mating impulses what are you what are your mating impulses well no it's a

23:18.320 --> 23:21.480
mating ritual you know like people go to a bar and they want to meet people like

23:21.480 --> 23:24.520
everyone's trying to make people are generally trying to reproduce or they're

23:24.520 --> 23:28.680
they're in a monogamous relationship but people are generally driven by their

23:28.680 --> 23:33.480
sex drives and it used to be you would go into the world to try to do that and

23:33.480 --> 23:38.080
now this has been digitized and so there's this whole new thing forming

23:38.080 --> 23:42.120
which is like you know like the way it works is like I don't know what was your

23:42.120 --> 23:46.680
name it's not only what's up not only and it's only like if I wanted to sleep

23:46.680 --> 23:53.760
with you I here's it what he said thank you I would look it if you were awesome

23:53.760 --> 24:14.040
I thought he said I do but in Russian but you know it's a series of likes so

24:14.040 --> 24:17.160
you like someone's picture and then they like your picture and then you like

24:17.160 --> 24:20.000
their picture now you're doing the thing where you that's the digital version

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
of looking at someone and looking away and then you catch them looking at you

24:23.000 --> 24:29.480
now they got you got the the cupids and the the what's all the dating stuff and

24:29.480 --> 24:36.360
there's a Christian mingle swiper swiper tinder well I was I was doing a

24:36.360 --> 24:41.120
I was doing a comedy show in the Midwest and but now I've but since then I have

24:41.120 --> 24:46.160
seen this commercial here in Los Angeles it's a like farmer dates like it's a

24:46.160 --> 24:53.160
what's it called farmer date what state farmer state farmer no it's not

24:53.160 --> 24:59.560
state farmer it's a farmer it's not stink farmer it's a farmer's dating thing

24:59.560 --> 25:04.080
what's that what's that anyone know the name of it huh data farmer and they

25:04.080 --> 25:08.320
go like yeah find a farmer and yeah yeah you're a farmer you want to date a

25:08.320 --> 25:12.800
farmer find farmers and at the end it goes date a farmer city food just do

25:12.800 --> 25:25.200
get it it's Christian mingle but for people that grow soybeans and and there

25:25.200 --> 25:29.840
aren't Christian apparently that they have to go to the greatest tag new

25:29.840 --> 25:36.600
commercial of all time the internet really is ubiquitous now that if there's

25:36.600 --> 25:43.320
pockets of it were for non-city folk that's pretty amazing welcome to

25:43.320 --> 25:51.200
hillbilly.gov we don't cotton a technology round this domain welcome to

25:51.200 --> 26:01.200
homeless hookup great idea employed people just don't get it we really did

26:01.200 --> 26:09.200
it we also don't know how to monetize this

26:09.200 --> 26:14.200
the money's coming in from the from the homeless people there's people there

26:14.200 --> 26:17.080
might be people who want to date a farmer or a homeless person like do you

26:17.080 --> 26:22.120
have to be another farmer like a sexy lady that's like like like like I would

26:22.120 --> 26:26.000
say I'm pretty sure there's a certain percentage of traffic on Christian

26:26.000 --> 26:29.160
mingle or jade date that aren't Christian or Jewish I would say there's lots of

26:29.160 --> 26:33.000
people that are sure phoning in and saying like yeah I love the Lord as much

26:33.000 --> 26:37.040
as the other next guy I heard that Christian mingle has the highest

26:37.040 --> 26:47.880
assault rate for a dating site I don't know that's the kind of thing that

26:47.880 --> 26:51.600
would immediately have traction like you just created you just created that

26:51.600 --> 26:55.960
like like idea that's gonna be well it makes sense doesn't it cuz like if you're

26:55.960 --> 27:03.240
a fundamentalist Christian you believe in a death God you believe in a god that's

27:03.240 --> 27:07.320
eventually gonna destroy the planet sacrificed his child and you worship

27:07.320 --> 27:11.240
that being you pray to that being so wouldn't it does make sense that you

27:11.240 --> 27:15.280
would it's a sacrifice God so some percentage of the people who go on

27:15.280 --> 27:19.720
Christian mingle probably still believe the old ways and think where you

27:19.720 --> 27:25.320
sacrifice your date yeah because God in the Old Testament was always telling

27:25.320 --> 27:30.480
people like you must kill your son today right yeah so how does like I'm sure

27:30.480 --> 27:34.320
people on Christian mingle the same thing happens where the transmission comes

27:34.320 --> 27:37.640
down like if you believe in me you will decapitate probably some casual

27:37.640 --> 27:43.200
Christians I think that use the internet to date like sure like you know

27:43.200 --> 27:48.320
like a kid like a nice like you're like yeah I don't have to be a fundamentalist

27:48.320 --> 27:51.880
they're not snakes wrapped around their neck most Christians are in the end of

27:51.880 --> 28:03.400
decapitation it is an awesome terrifying God the Old Testament God though I

28:03.400 --> 28:09.160
just gotten a weird conversation about that with Aaron because I was we were

28:09.160 --> 28:13.000
talking about my my Hebrew name Daniel and how I like that story in the Bible

28:13.000 --> 28:18.920
and the Old Testament God and I was kind of talking about how I like that God and

28:18.920 --> 28:22.200
she was kind of she's a pastor's daughter so she kind of like I don't know

28:22.200 --> 28:28.200
she did she had a differently she wasn't have an objective I was I was I was

28:28.200 --> 28:31.960
somehow offending her an accident I didn't mean to I was just being Joseph

28:31.960 --> 28:37.160
Cambly about it like what what offense did she take I don't know we were

28:37.160 --> 28:42.400
probably both drunk and she surely not I think that I think that she took it to

28:42.400 --> 28:47.040
mean somehow that I that I had a that I that I preferred it to the New Testament

28:47.040 --> 28:52.360
God I don't know or that God isn't it well I mean meaning that he had a new

28:52.360 --> 28:57.920
attitude I think I think that part of the appeal of modern Christianity is that

28:57.920 --> 29:02.840
some of the barbarism and misogyny and things that were that the Old

29:02.840 --> 29:08.800
Testament steeped in it have been somehow can be somehow opted out yet by

29:08.800 --> 29:14.280
way of the Terminator 2 like like movie you know okay well you've heard it this

29:14.280 --> 29:18.680
way but now it's like this which is a huge value add to the sequel I love the

29:18.680 --> 29:23.880
New Testament I like reading it and I sometimes like it's a good thing to read

29:23.880 --> 29:26.200
when you're meditating or something you'll find a little verse but you

29:26.200 --> 29:31.200
really do have to wade through like you have to have a big filter to read any

29:31.200 --> 29:34.640
part of the New Testament because it's pretty dense it's not just that it's

29:34.640 --> 29:38.400
dense it's just always it always ends in like there's I was just reading this

29:38.400 --> 29:41.400
verse in it which is like Christ is sending the disciples out into the

29:41.400 --> 29:47.440
world to to spread the message and he says to them you know when go into a

29:47.440 --> 29:51.080
town and if they accept you you know give them your blessing and if they

29:51.080 --> 29:54.840
don't accept you at the gates of the town shake the dust from your feet and

29:54.840 --> 30:01.480
say to them your town is fucked you're so cursed yeah like it's a crater your

30:01.480 --> 30:05.720
town is gonna be a crater now so yeah yeah go around go around and check up on

30:05.720 --> 30:09.480
them and then if as you're leaving you don't like it give them the yeah it

30:09.480 --> 30:14.280
means like do you're going to get blown up and like I was listening to I like

30:14.280 --> 30:18.840
listening to Christian radio it's really fun to listen to Christian radio and

30:18.840 --> 30:23.840
highly recommend listening to Christian music and pretending that you're Jesus

30:23.840 --> 30:26.960
and that the songs

30:29.600 --> 30:38.160
what the fuck how did those wires get crushed no I was very clear about because

30:38.160 --> 30:44.120
you will realize how creeped out Jesus would be by Christians if you listen to

30:44.120 --> 30:49.680
the way they sing to him I said love each other and they killed me why use

30:49.680 --> 30:53.400
what what is this song about yeah well this I mean this is the this is the

30:53.400 --> 30:58.400
problem that I have I that I that I sometimes run into because I'm a I'm a

30:58.400 --> 31:02.680
respected person among people who are very intelligent they like their science

31:02.680 --> 31:06.680
fiction is their personalities that don't typically come with rosary beads

31:06.680 --> 31:13.760
attached to them and modern Christianity is is you know it's what what

31:13.760 --> 31:18.680
modern American Christianity what is that that's not connected at all to to the

31:18.680 --> 31:23.080
value of this mythology which is that there was this guy who was kind of

31:23.080 --> 31:28.720
awesome he's a heroic figure he really you know it's like we love Martin Luther

31:28.720 --> 31:33.520
King Jr. like like like Jesus was like kind of kind of did a lot of that kind

31:33.520 --> 31:38.840
of shit like sacrifice himself because he believed in people being nice to each

31:38.840 --> 31:43.000
other and as far as the myth goes it's like it's very empowering the idea of

31:43.000 --> 31:47.520
that that that you can be this is Christmas time Christ mess like the

31:47.520 --> 31:52.880
Christ Christ word means half man half God right like this is a the idea that

31:52.880 --> 31:58.400
of Christ is supposed to be the idea I thought that we can all do this we can

31:58.400 --> 32:05.480
all we all have it within us to wield the power of these old Babylonian

32:05.480 --> 32:10.520
Sumerian kind of Mesopotamian like like bogeymen like who make the thunder

32:10.520 --> 32:15.680
crack and who make the cancer bloom and who make the cows die overnight like

32:15.680 --> 32:22.360
all that cosmic chaos that we used to just chalk up to fuck my luck or some

32:22.360 --> 32:28.160
weird superstition we can start to embody that power take control of it and

32:28.160 --> 32:33.040
and because as we're doing that we have a responsibility to each other to value

32:33.040 --> 32:37.280
human life and stuff so is that like like like that that what does that have

32:37.280 --> 32:41.960
to do with Billy Graham yeah nothing that's why that's why the Gnostics say

32:41.960 --> 32:47.400
that or I've read that the Gnostics say that in Graham Hancock who's this really

32:47.400 --> 32:51.760
amazing like far out historians like believes that like humans have been

32:51.760 --> 32:58.680
here much longer and he up he was telling me that you the Gnostics believe

32:58.680 --> 33:03.920
that so Satan the first thing Satan is gonna do is convince everyone that he

33:03.920 --> 33:08.400
is God or that he is Jesus that's the move you convince people that you're

33:08.400 --> 33:13.640
you're the Lord of Love and that's the person that George Bush worshipped is

33:13.640 --> 33:18.720
actually Satan that modern Christianity is actually Satanism because only it's

33:18.720 --> 33:27.360
only Satan would tell a president you should drop bombs no no no lord of

33:27.360 --> 33:32.840
love would say that like Jesus is all love Jesus represents love like love at

33:32.840 --> 33:37.520
all costs love no matter what love everyone and forget about yourself you

33:37.520 --> 33:42.600
lose yourself completely in love and that's the that's what I think Christianity

33:42.600 --> 33:47.480
is but somehow it gets diverted and they say this is because of the that Roman

33:47.480 --> 33:51.400
emperor who recognized that Christianity was spreading and wanted to make it a

33:51.400 --> 33:54.800
state religion and that's why I had they had that gathering of people they're

33:54.800 --> 33:58.720
like okay this love thing's great but we still need to decapitate and murder

33:58.720 --> 34:03.240
people and set things on fire so what just set up all these like weird rules

34:03.240 --> 34:06.920
like a country club like about the Trinity and what pants you can wear and

34:06.920 --> 34:12.360
yeah it's all ridiculous I mean but and and by the way so is so is any like

34:12.360 --> 34:17.600
organized sect of Taoism Buddhism like if you if you if you let the bread out

34:17.600 --> 34:21.640
long enough like all you got you come back ten minutes later and the biggest

34:21.640 --> 34:25.920
dickhead in the room is in charge like the guy who says like let's all let's

34:25.920 --> 34:29.960
all do it this way and let's all do it that way go fuck yourself like religion

34:29.960 --> 34:34.800
is supposed to be a personal tie between an individual or the unknown the very

34:34.800 --> 34:38.520
concept of organized religion is incredibly problematic now I'm not

34:38.520 --> 34:43.960
saying let's do away with organizing spiritual conversations organizing

34:43.960 --> 34:48.120
spirit religion at all but what I am saying is that that's it's just like

34:48.120 --> 34:51.440
that's not religion things that you're talking to other people about are not

34:51.440 --> 34:56.560
your your your relationship with the unknown Jesus said that by the way I

34:56.560 --> 35:00.840
mean he said a lot of shit but but he talked about how basically prayers that

35:00.840 --> 35:06.440
you do in front of other people are they're they're fine and good but

35:06.440 --> 35:10.200
they're not they don't really count yeah don't pray on the street corners like

35:10.200 --> 35:13.640
the whoever they are do I can't remember you should be in a closet somewhere

35:13.640 --> 35:17.480
like like like meditating about this like like like like like really atoning

35:17.480 --> 35:21.120
with this thing that can fuck you up you know that book the sacred mushroom in

35:21.120 --> 35:25.400
the cross by John Marcus Allegro have you ever heard of that like it I I have a

35:25.400 --> 35:32.640
quote on the dust jacket got devil in the baked beans is boom by whatever you

35:32.640 --> 35:36.400
just said that's the devil in the baked beans was a second but I'm largely

35:36.400 --> 35:40.920
responsible for that books tremendous sales

35:42.040 --> 35:47.400
it is theory is that Christianity what started as a mushroom cult and he has

35:47.400 --> 35:51.000
all these amazing pictures of what do you what do you mean by mushroom cult a

35:51.000 --> 35:55.240
mushroom cult where the early that Jesus was a mushroom and that the whole thing

35:55.240 --> 35:59.160
was like talking about the information they were getting was coming from eating

35:59.160 --> 36:04.600
mushrooms like the God sacrifice was imbibing mushrooms and the communion was

36:04.600 --> 36:09.360
actually mushrooms which is why I went like the instruction for communion is

36:09.360 --> 36:13.040
before you take communion you should forgive your enemies you have to make

36:13.040 --> 36:15.960
sure that you've forgiven everyone because it's if you're gonna go on a

36:15.960 --> 36:19.880
mushroom trip and you go there in a bad headspace it'll be terrible so the whole

36:19.880 --> 36:24.040
thing is like a veiled mushroom cult and there's awesome pictures of like in

36:24.040 --> 36:27.480
these early Christian churches of Adam and Eve and they're standing

36:27.480 --> 36:31.520
underneath clearly a mushroom like they're standing next to there's all

36:31.520 --> 36:37.560
these pictures of mushrooms and it's like this is a what's that the tree of

36:37.560 --> 36:40.600
the knowledge of good and evil was actually a mushroom and that's Terence

36:40.600 --> 36:46.200
McKenna's idea which is like the stoned ape theory that like proto hominids took

36:46.200 --> 36:52.000
mushrooms and that's what caused this massive expansion of the neocortex way

36:52.000 --> 36:56.480
back when is because mushrooms grow on the shit of bovine animals which is what

36:56.480 --> 37:00.520
our early proto hominids would have been hunting and since we're omnivores we

37:00.520 --> 37:03.360
would have been eating the mushrooms I could believe that because there's a

37:03.360 --> 37:09.000
shared experience on mushrooms like Sylas Simon has a sort of set of almost

37:09.000 --> 37:16.720
inarticulable but by now we've figured out that it's shared the the type of

37:16.720 --> 37:21.760
consciousness shift that you have on mushrooms it always happens sometimes you

37:21.760 --> 37:26.520
have a bad trip sometimes you think your friend is a Dracula yeah sometimes you

37:26.520 --> 37:30.680
come to Harmontown wearing underwear and a Santa hat

37:30.680 --> 37:35.120
oh that's that's the Russian equivalent of home

37:35.120 --> 37:43.920
that's it but but but but that because it really is like this weird like people

37:43.920 --> 37:49.880
talk about you know like straight lace people who would never like who

37:49.880 --> 37:54.680
associate drugs with criminality and but who for one reason or another ended

37:54.680 --> 38:00.280
up taking this Sylas Simon thing they they report the same experience as a

38:00.280 --> 38:07.000
groovy dude they have the same sort of weird momentary realization about

38:07.000 --> 38:11.960
perspective yeah and an uplifting one not one that makes you feel like a

38:11.960 --> 38:15.640
meaningless speck in an infinite universe but one that makes you feel like

38:15.640 --> 38:19.520
you're connected to all things yeah and imagine doing that instead of doing it at

38:19.520 --> 38:25.080
a party or in your apartment imagine being in some early ancient Christian

38:25.080 --> 38:29.800
church with incense burning and people saying these weird chants and you're

38:29.800 --> 38:33.480
eating the mushrooms with the intention of connecting with the Godhead that would

38:33.480 --> 38:39.840
be a very intense trip but you know it would and it'd be it'd be amazing which

38:39.840 --> 38:43.880
is why sometimes I think of modern Christianity as people who only like

38:43.880 --> 38:49.200
it's like people who have stacked wood and they're putting their hands in front

38:49.200 --> 38:53.120
of the wood and pretending there's a fire there but they haven't lit the wood

38:53.120 --> 38:57.720
on fire and the psychedelic is what ignites the fire and that's what really

38:57.720 --> 39:02.680
creates the true feeling of the presence of God by the way you know the

39:02.680 --> 39:06.400
whole thing about Christmas of course and Santa Claus is actually a

39:06.400 --> 39:10.560
representation of the Amanita Muscaria mushroom have you ever heard that no

39:10.560 --> 39:16.800
yeah man totally like everybody everybody right now reach under your

39:16.800 --> 39:24.760
seats you'll find a mushroom yeah no 45 minutes it's just gonna get wow there's

39:24.760 --> 39:27.800
a lot of stuff on the internet about it Google search it but the color of the

39:27.800 --> 39:32.520
Amanita Muscaria mushroom is red and white which is exactly the color that

39:32.520 --> 39:37.280
Santa Claus wears but that was a later-day thing that he was originally

39:37.280 --> 39:42.080
not red and white that was a very later-day 50s 40s Coca-Cola thing like

39:42.080 --> 39:46.440
that would he was green and white up until very recently well sometimes the

39:46.440 --> 39:53.040
Amanita Muscaria is a green and white yeah all right whatever fits into my

39:53.040 --> 40:00.440
mushroom story asshole you know one thing that academic I love the angle

40:00.440 --> 40:03.320
though that like what if we just did prove that Santa and Jesus was just all

40:03.320 --> 40:07.600
about mushrooms yeah I don't think it's that big a leap I mean I really don't

40:07.600 --> 40:15.360
it's yeah well yeah well also also they they say that the druids would hang

40:15.360 --> 40:21.200
these mushrooms to dry on pine trees and that that's that that's the whole like

40:21.200 --> 40:26.360
hey like hanging shit on trees actually comes from drying these mushrooms out to

40:26.360 --> 40:30.720
do this like a psychedelic ritual and I'll shut up about mushrooms but there's

40:30.720 --> 40:37.360
one more point I want to make which is that the druids would drink each other's

40:37.360 --> 40:42.920
piss because if you eat mushrooms this silo-sibon still stays in the urine and

40:42.920 --> 40:46.640
so just couldn't get enough they couldn't get enough yeah or they drink

40:46.640 --> 40:50.360
their own piss to like start tripping again which you can do and they just

40:50.360 --> 40:55.400
actually leave out a plate and glass of piss

41:00.440 --> 41:05.720
you know one thing one thing that I though when I went through like a like

41:05.720 --> 41:12.640
a heavy-duty kind of like I think getting more into Jesus mythology because of

41:12.640 --> 41:16.200
Campbell and stuff like that so I started I watched Jesus Christ Superstar

41:16.200 --> 41:21.480
again and was like this is this is really cool and and started while I watched

41:21.480 --> 41:24.880
some documentaries and stuff and Campbell so compelled you by the myth of

41:24.880 --> 41:28.160
Jesus Christ that you went right out and rented Jesus Christ Superstar they did

41:28.160 --> 41:31.920
and that's a that's a catchy one man I took Aaron to see that New York she was

41:31.920 --> 41:35.760
blown away she'd only ever seen God spell man Jesus Christ that will convert

41:35.760 --> 41:41.320
you can eat God spells like for breakfast yeah all right so one more

41:41.320 --> 41:44.200
thing and then we'll get off of Jesus cuz I just got off of him an hour ago you

41:44.200 --> 41:46.640
know what I'm saying

41:50.760 --> 41:58.040
Justin can we can we edit in lightning and thunder or sleigh bells I thought

41:58.040 --> 42:00.920
one of the bit but there's biblical historians you know they're kind of

42:00.920 --> 42:04.920
lying between academics and you know you know the people that are sort of

42:04.920 --> 42:12.160
researching the actual historical person Jesus there's some of them believe

42:12.160 --> 42:20.440
that the reason for his personality his character his message that he brought

42:20.440 --> 42:24.480
was that as a as a youngster growing up he was an apprentice to his dad who

42:24.480 --> 42:28.560
probably would have been a stone mason on a carpenter and I don't know did he

42:28.560 --> 42:32.000
grow up in Jerusalem or was it where it was ever so wherever he was like

42:32.000 --> 42:37.000
spending his his younger years when when you kind of like don't I think wasn't

42:37.000 --> 42:46.040
he was yeah thank you sir but but is he Jesus who hung out in Nazareth though he

42:46.040 --> 42:50.880
was 38 or is he Jesus who was born in Nazareth and like he was he was he was

42:50.880 --> 42:56.160
born in Long Beach yeah and then he lived in that anyways when he was

42:56.160 --> 43:00.600
apprenticing for his dad he would have been in this tremendous port city being

43:00.600 --> 43:04.840
a stone mason would have been exposed if he was going if he was working in

43:04.840 --> 43:10.200
imports and exports as a stone mason might in that city like like kind of

43:10.200 --> 43:16.440
been exposed to a lot of Eastern philosophy coming coming in off of those

43:16.440 --> 43:20.400
those same docs I don't know talking out of my butt but I always thought that

43:20.400 --> 43:39.120
was interesting it's the least wonderful time I don't know my wish from

43:39.120 --> 43:43.720
Russian Santa that's you're really warm you're really warm I'm not gonna touch

43:43.720 --> 43:47.920
you anymore you're really warm all right what what what topic do you have

43:47.920 --> 43:54.160
ownership over this evening what is it that we said that made you entitled to

43:54.160 --> 44:00.200
look religion the idea that the majority of religion how much of religion did you

44:00.200 --> 44:05.160
attribute to mushrooms at least all of it or just the big one that the other

44:05.160 --> 44:10.920
ones I didn't I didn't attribute to I was I was citing a book that isn't a

44:10.920 --> 44:15.240
Ted talk or a Senate hearing like nothing's nothing's gonna happen if you

44:15.240 --> 44:23.440
don't do anything the worst-case scenario is a good show that's it if you

44:23.440 --> 44:27.120
just listen no there's no nothing no nobody's gonna kick in your door

44:27.120 --> 44:30.400
tomorrow night and like go you didn't say anything when Duncan trust also the

44:30.400 --> 44:34.840
mushrooms were religion they came for Duncan trust when I did nothing and then

44:34.840 --> 44:38.280
they came for the stone masons and I did nothing and then they kicked in my

44:38.280 --> 44:43.320
door don't bring the Holocaust into this I was gonna bring in the expulsion that

44:43.320 --> 44:50.160
happened 400 years ago in Prague but what ifs so religion is a really

44:50.160 --> 44:54.960
important personal force I believe that a lot of what our spiritual journeys do

44:54.960 --> 44:59.840
take place internally but the idea that the representation of religion is

44:59.840 --> 45:05.480
something that people go together to ignore God and just to worship a fire

45:05.480 --> 45:09.800
that isn't there just seems problematic as someone who's had a lot of his

45:09.800 --> 45:15.480
religious I played the fuck out of Linus when I was in Charlie Brown I did

45:15.480 --> 45:24.040
not puke on my director when I was in Charlie I was gonna end my speech by

45:24.040 --> 45:34.440
singing Mary we wish you a merry Christmas but alright as someone who's

45:34.440 --> 45:38.280
had a lot of wonderful experiences being around people around the Christmas

45:38.280 --> 45:42.920
tree spending holidays letting them in or doing things like that when you see

45:42.920 --> 45:47.040
religion as something that doesn't connect you one way to God but you to

45:47.040 --> 45:51.000
God to everyone else that you're willing to spend time with religion can be a

45:51.000 --> 45:54.960
wonderful social leveler it can be a reason to get out of your house it can

45:54.960 --> 45:59.280
be a reason to visit the invalid and charity and especially Christian

45:59.280 --> 46:03.400
charity is not something that is easy it is something that we choose to do

46:03.400 --> 46:06.600
because of what we believe to help people out who are less fortunate who

46:06.600 --> 46:14.360
are more Goldbergian than Harmonian let's say in our society I'm not you're

46:14.360 --> 46:20.160
booing me and you prove my point but the losers of people trip over the words the

46:20.160 --> 46:24.000
people who have the only tie that we have to them in our society is that they

46:24.000 --> 46:28.400
had they have their names written in the same type of book in the beginning of

46:28.400 --> 46:34.560
pages where you keep the family history the same scroll the same commandments

46:34.560 --> 46:46.560
Crucify him! He's here to save Christmas you guys. Adam Goldberg came on stage to us.

46:46.560 --> 46:49.800
And it's the reason that we go we go away to the cold and the snow when we

46:49.800 --> 46:55.720
rather be playing Xbox and we sing we wish you a merry Christmas we wish you

46:55.720 --> 47:02.840
a merry Christmas we wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year thank you

47:02.840 --> 47:10.920
Adam Goldberg! Adam Goldberg everybody. What's your mind, reindeer?

47:10.920 --> 47:15.480
He wants to know where his reindeer are. Something about his reindeer.

47:15.480 --> 47:21.440
Duncan, Anatoly can we can we talk a little bit about this because I have

47:21.440 --> 47:30.240
some opinions about this song. In my estimation the shittiest Christmas song

47:30.240 --> 47:35.760
ever ever perpetrated on mankind. This is a bad one. I've even heard that Paul

47:35.760 --> 47:39.400
McCartney is ashamed of himself for this. Not so ashamed that he's had it

47:39.400 --> 47:42.720
stricken from the record. I'm proud of you because every year Jeff and I have a

47:42.720 --> 47:46.040
tradition we try to make it as far as we can without hearing this song. Also I

47:46.040 --> 47:49.160
don't like but I heard it with my fucking Uber on the way over here.

47:49.160 --> 47:54.800
Duncan what is this song? Before we get to it there's another song Jingle Bell Rock

47:54.800 --> 48:00.400
the line giddy up jingle horse makes me want to take my own life. Don't fucking

48:00.400 --> 48:04.960
say giddy up jingle horse. Jingle horse isn't a fucking thing it's not an icon

48:04.960 --> 48:09.520
but it's not an iconic Christmas thing. Jingle horse. Go fuck everybody that

48:09.520 --> 48:14.120
ever sang it and wrote it. More importantly can we all just go

48:14.120 --> 48:19.400
go after this Harmontown and find Paul McCartney wherever he is and sing this on

48:19.400 --> 48:25.440
his doorstep for 72 hours and make him because I walked into a shop when he

48:25.440 --> 48:30.240
asked us to go away we say why I was good enough for us I was yeah wasn't it

48:30.240 --> 48:34.400
when you wrote this song when you when you wrote down a cocktail napkin on the

48:34.400 --> 48:39.280
way to the studio the first Christmas Carol I heard because it was it was

48:39.280 --> 48:43.160
August you know I went to see a movie and they started the Christmas carols

48:43.160 --> 48:48.000
early of course and the first one I heard I walked in and Duncan treat

48:48.000 --> 48:54.800
yourself to these rich majestic mythic literally like in the lyrics like he

48:54.800 --> 49:00.840
says fuck it like almost almost like it you know fucking I fuck who gives a

49:00.840 --> 49:19.960
shit fuck it simply having cold out there's lights I don't know simply

49:19.960 --> 49:40.560
ignoring the rules of show don't tell me the Christmas tree is great

49:40.560 --> 49:51.640
simply simply yeah how about make it a little more complex I met a guy he was

49:51.640 --> 50:19.120
had a moustache okay which feeling okay now what this is because there is a

50:19.120 --> 50:28.120
dark moment in the song it was it was it was it was it was composed by a kid

50:28.120 --> 50:36.480
shopping at Sears pressing demo buttons no you know it's I'm surprised green

50:36.480 --> 50:41.200
sleeves isn't in there somewhere on accident it sounds like what they

50:41.200 --> 50:48.000
blast to people in Guantanamo Bay this is how we got Noriega with this fucking

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
song

51:01.440 --> 51:07.920
minor key for no reason if you go to a minor key if you go to a minor key he

51:07.920 --> 51:12.240
fucking wrote yesterday in blackbird and shit he's Paul McCartney he's a song

51:12.240 --> 51:16.200
writer he wrote some goodies he also wrote fucking Maxwell Silverhammer which

51:16.200 --> 51:24.240
can go fuck itself but he was in a band with fucking John Lennon and George

51:24.240 --> 51:27.040
and George Harrison he could have he could have fucking stepped it up a

51:27.040 --> 51:30.480
couple times somebody needs to play that song backwards is anyone done that yeah

51:30.480 --> 51:36.800
yeah you get tomorrow never knows it's fucking about somebody that I know said

51:36.800 --> 51:40.960
that they were on on a set with Ringo Starr and and they were like the crew was

51:40.960 --> 51:44.480
like yeah we got Ringo Starr my favorite Beatles you know George Harrison my

51:44.480 --> 51:47.600
favorite Beatles John Lennon and someone's like you know Paul McCartney

51:47.600 --> 51:51.120
like a fucking guy like he wrote you know he wrote a lot of bullshit songs

51:51.120 --> 51:53.600
yeah I guess he wrote a couple good ones but like mostly like you fucking like

51:53.600 --> 51:56.960
he had to he wrote this one on that one and and Ringo you know who had every

51:56.960 --> 52:00.440
reason to not like Paul walked up because oh so you're you're taking the

52:00.440 --> 52:04.440
shit out of me out of our poly he goes he wrote a couple good ones too like

52:04.440 --> 52:07.960
like like like whatever shit you talk about Paul McCartney you have to feel he

52:07.960 --> 52:13.800
did fucking write a lot of fucking goodies now in high relief to the fucking

52:13.800 --> 52:18.800
beautiful artwork that he made this happens

52:22.320 --> 52:27.000
that's what they're kids if you're gonna go to a minor key it has to go to a

52:27.000 --> 52:31.440
dark place mythologically you have to say but it wasn't as we but can you back

52:31.440 --> 52:35.080
it up because I want everyone to hear the entire what the choir of children

52:35.080 --> 52:45.480
sing this is because there's three parts to it simply

52:45.480 --> 52:48.960
nothing simple

52:48.960 --> 53:00.160
children sing this song here's their song

53:13.280 --> 53:18.520
the kids are as fucked up as McCartney like that I don't know he throws it to

53:18.520 --> 53:47.920
them and they're like we'll take your word for it

53:48.520 --> 53:56.240
the word is out the word is out the party is down

53:56.240 --> 54:10.160
okay I've always given up on the song long before that happened we're usually

54:10.160 --> 54:17.320
deep in conversation but I think he said he wants to lift a glass he doesn't

54:17.320 --> 54:20.320
know how

54:24.360 --> 54:41.400
don't look are we Santa no no now we're down the rabbit hole now I want my

54:41.400 --> 54:50.280
it was just plans for D-day or something no one had ever heard it yes my

54:50.280 --> 55:14.040
assaults a security number the cure for cancer mix of two-part songs take it kids

55:14.040 --> 55:23.960
oh wait yeah and that's enough that's it like I say like it's all it's your

55:23.960 --> 55:31.640
plan throw some fucking man for Christmas yeah simply fulfilling a record

55:31.640 --> 55:34.880
label contractual agreement

55:35.520 --> 55:41.200
fuck him now Dan and now it was maybe two Christmases ago was the last year

55:41.200 --> 55:44.720
was the last Christmas three three because it was the first time I kissed

55:44.720 --> 55:50.240
Aaron I remember the night you're talking about because I know the next song

55:50.240 --> 55:55.960
you want to play because I love as I think I don't know I just turned 40 I

55:55.960 --> 56:03.720
grew up on the the peanuts Christmas specials and brilliantly they chose

56:03.720 --> 56:08.040
Vince Garaldi trio to do all that music and it's like you don't have to like

56:08.040 --> 56:12.880
jazz to love Vince Garaldi trio and and if you don't like jazz listen to Vince

56:12.880 --> 56:18.160
Garaldi trio and then at least dig him and and and the boys and the music in

56:18.160 --> 56:22.760
the the peanut specials is really melancholy like it's really sad it's

56:22.760 --> 56:27.760
kind of blow your brains out darkness to it but it's also for me the

56:27.760 --> 56:33.000
Christmas like from like I have really fond Christmas memories I grew up in a

56:33.000 --> 56:36.840
nice small family and then everybody got along more or less and and Christmas was

56:36.840 --> 56:41.560
always fun but the music is sad yeah Charles Schultz had to fight for the

56:41.560 --> 56:47.240
darkness and the peanuts specials but we and what a good fight because the whole

56:47.240 --> 56:51.920
point of it is it is solstice it's that like everything it's quiet and you put

56:51.920 --> 56:55.800
up an evergreen tree to convince yourself that the sun will come out tomorrow

56:55.800 --> 57:00.600
there's an automatic bubblegum flavor to Christmas that yeah I think it's it's

57:00.600 --> 57:05.560
like fun to overcome and counter with the natural like kind of stillness and

57:05.560 --> 57:09.320
darkness because I love I'll be home for Christmas because I believe and I'm

57:09.320 --> 57:12.800
sure that somebody will prove me wrong on this one but as far as I know I'll be

57:12.800 --> 57:16.920
home for Christmas was came out during World War two and it's whether it came

57:16.920 --> 57:20.280
up before that that was a big hit for the troops because the idea that I'll be

57:20.280 --> 57:26.040
home if only in my dreams and families heard that song and it's really dark and

57:26.040 --> 57:29.440
it's the idea that like please have snow mistletoe and they bury the lead at the

57:29.440 --> 57:34.120
end like I won't be home for Christmas I might be in Italy I might be in in the

57:34.120 --> 57:38.440
Ardennes I might be I'm not be cannon the Kaiser well that's the world war one

57:38.440 --> 57:45.800
okay I might be Rosie Rivendin but like like and what's the one you like Dan you

57:45.800 --> 57:48.640
have your favorite I like that one which is the one that says through the years

57:48.640 --> 57:53.160
we all will be together if the fates allow so it's that's it's a it's a

57:53.160 --> 57:58.480
similar thought but it doesn't tie you to military service like it's we are all

57:58.480 --> 58:02.240
in the military because we're all at war with an uncompromising fucking

58:02.240 --> 58:08.120
sometimes unpredictable jealous crazy God that like creates ice ages and and

58:08.120 --> 58:13.280
freezes your crops and and and and and plays roller coaster with the infant

58:13.280 --> 58:17.960
mortality rate and and and and has viruses and good grasshoppers eat your

58:17.960 --> 58:24.720
face the the this this time of atonement with that in personal cosmic force you

58:24.720 --> 58:28.400
know yeah going like like we're all we're all in that military service at

58:28.400 --> 58:32.520
going like I'll maybe I'll be you know make Christmas wait it's it's it's the

58:32.520 --> 58:35.800
highest suicide rate of the year we all know that like is that true or is that

58:35.800 --> 58:41.160
just an urban myth that's from gremlins I mean that it is that's from

58:41.160 --> 58:49.400
gremlins Adam damn it Adam Adam go to bed

58:50.120 --> 58:54.720
what's your take on Adam Duncan like you even I gotta say man I thought it was

58:54.720 --> 58:58.400
very sweet what he did when he came up here but what was he doing I don't even

58:58.400 --> 59:01.440
know what he's doing I don't know if he was like a man about religion or he came

59:01.440 --> 59:06.760
up he came up to defend the the the god in Christmas yeah what's he doing that

59:06.760 --> 59:19.960
for what am I doing what was it what you don't you don't just hang out with him

59:19.960 --> 59:26.980
in a hammock like God is it God isn't Superman he doesn't save us from train

59:26.980 --> 59:33.040
crashes well that causes them to that's why you need that's why in Hinduism you

59:33.040 --> 59:37.440
need a Shiva to make sense of the whole thing like in Christianity things get

59:37.440 --> 59:41.920
really weird because you have this apparently all talk about I want to talk

59:41.920 --> 59:48.200
about Adam Goldberg and what a dick he is because he only just wanted to come

59:48.200 --> 59:52.040
on stage in order to come on stage he needed a point and his point needed to

59:52.040 --> 59:56.960
be contrary to something else but it wasn't like it doesn't because on any

59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.560
other given day Adam would be coming up here reminding us that we should be

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:05.080
skeptical of the Christian God because people got burnt at the stake and got

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:10.000
leeches put on him you know that Adam's heart is three sizes too small he just I

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.360
mean it like like at least don't don't don't lose the don't lose the moment like

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:18.560
a few if the if the stage is a big pink box with a red ribbon on it fucking

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:22.760
open it up and thank us for it like like let us get some pictures of you and

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:27.280
you and I agree with you I think that was that as motivation I think so Adam

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.480
but also I think you did come up with the idea that you were trying to defend

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:35.680
strangely Christmas but also I mean nobody up here was really trying to

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.000
defame Christmas I don't think I'm trying to bring that shit back

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.920
Dan you want to bring it back I'm saving Christmas up here can we can we bring

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.560
it back with all song that we are good at first like because again like I said

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.280
yeah we love the Vince Grawley trio so you all know this I'll play the vocal

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.160
version first so we all know this is the hardest we've ever laughed in our lives

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:59.040
so let's just dig the original version first okay so we can hear the kids from

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:18.440
peanuts sing it fuck you Paul McCartney this is a fucking good song

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:24.440
a really really happy beautiful lyrics set against the most minor dark beautiful

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:29.000
melancholic music of all time so what was the setup that we were just sitting

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:36.960
around and I was in a good mood because I kind of had a crush on this on this

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:41.880
girl that was starting to hang around right and so I played the the instrumental

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:47.560
version so let's see if we can pull this off I think I started this and then we

01:01:47.560 --> 01:02:03.120
did this for the next 30 minutes and we laughed for a three hour

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:27.920
because we were giggling because you were singing Dixon balls and beer to the

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:33.720
song and then it was kind of giggling and just drunk and it was late and and then

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:43.680
it was it was 3 p.m. well yeah compared to whenever we were we woke up the

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:51.720
fire is warm the perfect storm that's when I lost it balls and beer are the

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.960
perfect storm a Christmas time

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:04.200
like some tactician is looking at that on a piece of paper my god get out of

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:09.320
here there's gonna be dick's balls and beer at that party perfect store it's

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:22.960
fucking Christmas weird thing for children to sing it's weirder than

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:31.480
dick's balls and beer for children to be talking about the perfect storm you can't

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:37.640
you can't tell if the song is in favor of it or just a dire production some shit's

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.640
going to go down tonight

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:47.480
I was like one of the few the second third fourth times I met Erin and she

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:52.480
she came in the door and I was like I'm streaked with tears right now

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:57.480
listeners and we were in there and we were absolutely apoplectic we've been

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:03.440
doing this for an hour we kept doing it and there was many verses to it and

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:09.880
god damn it and she came in and we're like well it's a long story I went on a

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:13.160
little walk with her that night and I remember the tree that we stopped by

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:16.760
outside Dino's place and I kissed her for the first time but we didn't start

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:22.400
making out or anything it was still I was I I leaned in and I kissed her and

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:26.500
it was like I don't think I've ever had this experience where I just like she

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:31.280
just accepted the kiss but nothing else happens and it was just sort of like

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:39.640
little house in the prairie kind of like oh the courtship continues weird like we

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:45.080
yeah you know a kiss usually like evolves into something but she was not

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:51.560
she was not ready but was not rebuffing and so it just we just continued to like

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:57.880
we had a little barrel hoop that we ran with a stick made her a crown out of

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:05.480
daisies or something I went went went to read the Bible to my blind grandpa and

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:11.200
then I fucked her deep

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:21.800
and she found it all right let's have a special Christmas meeting with the real

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:31.520
the actual father of winter the embodiment of the solstice the the Nordic

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:39.880
traveling cold cold cold immune shorts in Times Square in January wearing

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:58.480
Spencer Crittenden hey hey hey guys you love the cold yeah yeah what's up what

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:02.960
was that Paul McCartney song what was it simply having a wonderful Christmas time

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:07.800
I take my word for it you could change one word of that song and it'd be any

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:14.920
holiday yeah yeah or it's or a day of the week or simply having a wonderful

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:23.040
turkey sandwich yeah son is up the mood is right yeah the mayo's white

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:28.520
rhymes with white the mood can be right for a turkey sandwich like it's it's

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:36.440
just anything yeah back massage a wonderful back massage you like in the

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:40.720
have yourself a little Christmas the idea that if through the years we all be

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:45.920
together if the fates allow that's a good lyric yeah like there's what is there

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:52.840
more to that song which I kind of like I change when I get up here get a mic this

01:06:52.840 --> 01:07:02.760
is too good if you like ladies and gentlemen Sean Connery

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:09.440
thank you so the original version of that song as it was written by whoever

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:14.600
Sammy Conner whoever wrote it out here through the years we all be together if

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:19.400
the fates allow until then we'll have to muddle through somehow mmm you know

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:23.520
melancholy oh and they change it to hang a shining star up on the high as well

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:30.400
that's a non-secret in your version so yeah wow yeah the hang a shining star

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.320
makes no sense no it's a non-secret I'd be curious to know because I thought maybe

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:38.720
Sammy Conner one of those one of those great like yeah yeah but like what year

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.680
it would be if that were a depression error or something like that because or

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:48.160
probably later than that 40s 40s yeah so but and I don't know exactly when that

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:53.400
change happened I do know that I mean it's but it might be the coolest thing

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:58.040
in the world but it's hard to imagine singing that that original lyric in the

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.440
way that traditionally you do because if that's that's the point where you

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:06.880
really swell hang a shining star you go crazy you go for it and bring it home

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:12.480
well the but the Ella Fitzgerald version she does she nails out she does it

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:16.440
really that's the original version of it I don't know if it's the original but

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:19.800
she does a version of it it's but she does the muddle through one or the yeah

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.760
she does the muddle through yes I've heard that but I think Sinatra does it

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:28.800
well yeah I think that's I don't think I have it on here I got a lot of the old stuff that's that's a goodie yeah

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:33.840
all right what's your name young man damn Dan Dan Christmas memory which can

that gladness night the pimps are about to come out at some point that's what I

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:53.640
love about this time of year it's effortless it's supported by an entire

01:10:53.640 --> 01:11:00.360
species history of this time of year being special I don't have to lecture

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:04.880
you guys about it I certainly don't need to be attacked by Adam Goldberg about it

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:11.920
I was I was I was really I was being the hero up here he tried to act like he was

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:21.160
slaying Darth Vader I resent it I resent him are you trying to tee up a

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:27.160
Christmas miracle right now Adam to come down from the he got up and I hope

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:29.400
he would just went to the bathroom I hope we don't hear a single Christmas

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:33.640
gunshot Christmas gunshot that's my favorite

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:48.720
jingle bang jingle by that's the New York New York coast I'd line

01:11:52.600 --> 01:12:01.160
jingle bell clock I honestly felt my life was being correct I got physical I

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:07.320
had an adrenaline rush when a skunk comes out I felt it in my my my third eye

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:11.800
like before I I even saw it was the motion combined with Rob Schrab going no

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:16.920
no no yeah because that's that's I'm sure that's what Rob will sound like if

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:21.720
someone shoots me yeah that's what right that's what it looks like that is what

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:27.360
it looks like it's like a quick shadowy rushing in and that's it your hands

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:34.800
are gone man just a scuttling sound a distant shriek and let BuzzFeed's 25

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:41.520
reasons Dan Harmon was interesting yeah be the last you ever hear of that was

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:47.880
fast that was fast that was like like new zombie you speed like I was driving

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:52.640
through an intersection with Schrab once we were like on Highland and Melrose I

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:59.720
think and and this fucking SUV I looked up and there was an SUV coming full

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:05.320
speed that did not say I think we were we were going straight and the SUV was

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:11.240
making a left turn we had the but and so and so you know like he was we were

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.640
going straight we had the right of way and this SUV just decided to continue

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:20.160
its left turn and and so just we're in the middle of a conversation about Gary

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:25.680
Shandling or something and and then we were going to die yeah because we were

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:32.360
going 35 45 miles an hour and and and he so was he and somehow Schrab just went

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:38.240
just cranked the wheel all the way and the end result was just somehow I swear

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:43.040
like molecules of the paint on the gun the respective cars must have must have

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:47.400
rushed up against each other like but nothing other than it happened it was

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:51.280
just like that it was just profound because that that's oh that's what it

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:55.800
feels like to die except for the very end part yeah which is you dying like

01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:03.320
that's that's what you see when when in this life is taken away from you it's

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:06.800
nothing just garbage just nothing just an Adam Goldberg darting out of the

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:12.280
shadows you won't be you won't you know I won't I won't have time to fix my

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:16.760
posture I won't my I'll have hair in my shoulders I'll be sitting next to a

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:22.280
kind as underwear nothing will be ceremonious about it and on top of that

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:25.600
I won't even be that cool and dramatic only Kennedys get to die that way like

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.840
most of us you know you get a fucking cancer in your nut one day it could it

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.720
could have taken you you could have gone out like that Charles Schultz get

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:37.360
cancer in his butt yeah but cancer the cancer you get time to say goodbye to

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:42.000
everybody when you get a Goldberg that's you don't get to say goodbye it's just

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.560
Adam Adam Rush the stage or my mate of the scene of platoon where the sapper

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:52.520
comes in he's runs into the end of the 10th everything goes up like that

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:56.480
like that's that's all you get yeah that's all you got Adam please don't kill

01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:04.360
us oh thank you we have your word we got a we got a we got a year-long renew that's

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:09.920
what that sounded like it's like through the years we'll all be together if the

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:17.600
fates allow Spencer what's your take on Christmas are you a sentimental guy

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:22.520
around the holidays I mean I like the idea of it but I'm more of a grump

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:27.120
around the holidays it's about unfulfilled expectations for me so yeah

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:32.880
but you get to do that that's fun well I get to well no because people are like

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:37.400
well Christmas has never been the same ever since my dad lost his leg it's

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:41.440
like yeah my parents got me a hello kitty digital camera one time I know you

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:48.040
feel what did they really yeah yeah it was that was yeah it would have been

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.680
better if it was a digital camera that was like worth half a crap but if it's

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:56.120
something you get for like $15 like the novelty value isn't even worth the

01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:01.640
utility you know it's not even a joke was that the beginning of the end of

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:07.200
your like if your dashed hopes around the holiday no that was the the lash on the

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:12.760
dead horse like I was like okay fuck it I'm gonna make my own happiness which I

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:15.720
should have carried on the rest of my life because I only do that for

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:19.360
Christmas is making my only happiness apparently how do you do that now I just

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:25.560
get myself the stuff I want and I tell everybody else to go fuck themselves

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:35.640
make that into a Christmas song man Spencer is mad the beard is long he

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:44.720
bought some gifts so sing a lot there you go see it's not fucking hard Paul

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:49.040
McCartney sir sir Paul McCartney I don't respect you be able to take your

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:54.080
fucking nighthood away for that fucking song there's you should at least make

01:16:54.080 --> 01:17:02.040
you fight a dragon if that's gonna be cuz you didn't get knighted for your

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:06.400
ability to protect the king yeah you got knighted for making for recording

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:11.240
yesterday so now that you recorded that Christmas song fight a dragon we'll call

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:16.000
it even well I don't think you should be I like what you're saying because I

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.960
think people get all victimy around the holidays and they pretend they don't

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:25.840
have control over what's going on but you can it's it's so fun just to oh I'll

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:32.320
tell you my Christmas memory Christmas Day I'm driving I'm I'm by myself and

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:37.040
I'm driving Christmas morning down I'm in West Hollywood driving the streets are

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:42.720
empty it's so fun to drive in Christmas the streets are empty I'm driving a

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:46.840
some kind of like you guys are not probably not gonna believe me and

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:51.360
sometimes I still think was it a hallucination but crossing the street was

01:17:51.360 --> 01:18:00.440
a giant mushroom even even we're even weirder even weirder crossing the street

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:10.640
was like a little you know a little buggy with a goat pulling it and a little

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:17.840
person riding in the buggy I still wonder did I dream it was it but I saw it I

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:22.440
saw it quickly went across the street crossing at the crosswalk it was no it

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:27.280
wasn't a crosswalk it was just I was like coming down from Fairfax I don't

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:31.400
know where it was a boat and a little person it was a goat pulling a little

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:36.600
buggy with a little person in it was he was the little person doing this

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:42.320
voluntarily was the guy was the little person who was clearly set about this

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:45.960
arrangement no no there was paint the picture was it was it was a little

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:52.040
person like did he have reins it was he like it was fucking sinister man it was

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:56.240
like a merging of dimensions or something like this what sort of goat

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.600
those big those big goats or a little little mini-goats it was enough of a

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:04.280
goat to pull a buggy with a dwarf in it but but also to find buggy because

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:07.720
that's the other thing like a little it almost looked like a baby carriage it

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:12.760
was very gothy man it looked like a goth look baby carriage it was creepy now I

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:19.040
now I'm saying this and I feel like am I lying did this really happen I want to

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:25.120
live in a world where this did happen David Lynch now okay were they

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.760
crossing were they crossing the street from sidewalk to sidewalk are they

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.080
going down the street crossing crossing and did it look like they were going

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:34.600
with purpose or did it what was the look on the little person's face yes the

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:41.360
look into the carrot stand for sure the goat look tired no the look was like you

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.960
know like when you would see a squirrel that's trying to get from tree to tree

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:48.960
right it was like that kind of fervent and it knows it's not supposed to get

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:53.320
seen are you describing are you describing are you describing the goat

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:58.280
with a little person right now but every part of them so they were a team they

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:03.200
were a team yes they were together this was a duo yeah this wasn't this wasn't a

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:07.000
goat take making away with a little person this is this was the guy wasn't

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.960
kidnapping a little person this is a goat driven little person found

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:14.880
himself in this situation where they're like this no one's gonna believe this

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.760
and how do I get out of this because no matter how much I wave my arms people

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:24.600
keep waving back and I got I have 300 truth is I found my way into this buggy

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:29.440
this goat toad buggy and now it looks like I'm supposed to be in it have you

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:33.480
ever I can't get out and was that was the little person dressed up as Santa

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:39.000
Claus or or anything elf little person was wearing black black and this is

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.320
Christmas what day Christmas morning and I thought this is some kind of like

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:47.680
satanic art experiment where they know that only lonely people are driving

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:51.640
around on Christmas morning and if he goes by in his carriage it'll freak him

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:57.120
out permanently now and did you did you just drive past and say what the hell

01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:01.600
I did I think I would have pursued them I was so depressed that day that I was

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:11.000
just like of course yeah boy doesn't that sum it all up

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.440
talk about talk about dashed expectations cheese Louise for who you

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:21.560
the goat for everybody no no I think the goat answered a craigslist ad was like

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:29.480
this is not I'd like to think that that was just like the world's most funny

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:35.040
little person just like I'm gonna make everybody's day really complicated my

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:39.920
friend Billford on Fairfax one day on New Year's Day like at noon so everyone's

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:42.560
getting ready to work whatever party they're gonna go to and he's walking up

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:47.520
Fairfax like kind of around Cantor's and Damiano's pizza and he's going up the

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:51.520
street and he sees about two blocks up coming down like from where Fairfax high

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:57.320
would be as a guy maybe homeless maybe not like down on his luck for sure but

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:00.840
like you know not not not not working definitely renting yeah that not not

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:05.280
wearing a Sunday best but kind of a kind of a rag raggedy ragamuffin dude

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:09.560
coming coming at him at a full sprint from about two blocks away and Fred's a

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:13.880
big guy he's like 6 4 6 5 and like he can handle himself but there's a guy

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:20.840
coming down the road at a full clip and like full steam ahead out of and there's

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:23.480
no one else on the sidewalk and Fred's kind of bracing himself and the guy

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:28.000
runs up to him and grabs him by the shoulders he goes happy new year man only

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:42.920
four more to go it was not 1996 or 1998 it was it didn't round up to end like

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:46.120
like my and not 98 but I didn't round up to my own calendars or the end of the

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:54.600
millennium that's like page 23 of a Paul Rudd movie that's how he finds out

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:58.500
yeah but then the guy just got dispensed that happy information only for

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:02.400
when he's happy like we're gonna we're gonna make it and then rent and they

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:08.400
just kept going I had a friend that used to run on the streets he would take a

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:12.240
shirt off like when he'd be in foreign towns and he would take a shirt off and

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:16.960
just run and he just just go charging and he was a giant dude as well and he

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:20.000
would charge down the street and he'd grab somebody go what day is today what

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.720
day is it they got what they wouldn't do it today what day is it the Wednesday

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:30.320
well no no no no the date man the date they got it's June 11th of the year the

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:40.080
year 1998 it worked and then he just run down the street yelling at work in

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.760
his underwear it seems like that's a lot of energy to put into a show for one

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:53.000
person I don't know where where the payoff happens there speaking of payoff

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:59.280

here I can help dungeon master quark what do you want to roll the dice I could

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:48.080
do that Rob you'll be Mulraine Sedona that's Aaron's character Duncan will be

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:54.560

01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:06.920
Christmas yeah I don't have glasses spooky Christmas it doesn't matter Rob it

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:24.320
oh yeah this is great the dice are rolled the dais cast yeah last time on

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:29.120
Harmontown should I do it like spooky Christmas no no I can you can you

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:34.880
structure it like Paul's lyrics is Sharpie remembered for the third time

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:44.440
that he had a hawk he talked to Mitch Hurwitz I had a good time I guess I can't

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:52.560
I guess I can't after pulling off dark Admiral Darkstars darkhead our heroes

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:59.240
were now attacking his metallic golem is Sharpie attacked from the inside on

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:03.840
what he could swear was a heart Mulraine attempted to melt the metal monster

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:09.200
steel skin with their blazing armor after their individual attempts failed the

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:13.840
heroes outside the golem began attacking the head and unison sawing and

01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:19.200
cleaving at its neck in true decapitated fashion meanwhile Sharpie and

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:23.600
Avenger cracked wise and shrunk the glowing red heart node before diving

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.880
into two holes that were revealed to be the golems legs down there they spied

01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:33.520
glowing stones and Sharpie shrunk one because he was on a roll shrinking

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:39.680
stuff and it caused the golem to shudder and the stones glow to dim it seemed as

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:56.800
if it was just a matter of time until the golem was disassembled that's all so you

01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:03.960
guys know what to do now no no no why would they that doesn't matter where my

01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:09.880
Quark are located right now you as well as Duncan and Rob you guys are sitting

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:15.480
imagine sitting on the shoulders of this giant robot man are we still saw sawing

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:19.840
his head off yeah you two are sawing at his head with a wire saw and you are

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:24.880
hacking at it with your sword sword how far away through the neck are we right

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:31.120
now you know about a third on each side so there's about a third left how big is

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:38.200
this guy's neck I take I take my I take my mighty great sword pull it back out

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:47.680
and give it one more big slash one more okay he resents your audacity well

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:51.800
you're not Robert Redford in the natural you're gonna spark this scoreboard

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:59.120
Dennis Fredrick the great said Ladas Ladas to your Ladas did he that's audacious

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:03.320
audacious always I did I heard that Robert the okay said that and Robert the

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:10.760
great took that wait what did you credit Robert Robert the amazing Robert the

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:18.760
yeah so yeah like Robert the amazing you swing your sword did he have one

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:23.480
whatever move past its sponsor dealing you're not dealing damage in this case

01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:30.480
but you share the final bits of metal off this thing's head its head falls off

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:52.600
and the head is off and that's enough what's in his neck yeah what's in his

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:57.320
neck we look at his neck you see a floating glowing stone it's glowing with

01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:03.360
the a topaz I yell down ironically and sarcastically to Sharpie it looks like

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:11.880
it's heart you're down enough to grab that topaz thing I scramble up I mean

01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:16.120
what do I perceive what do I know you're in a foot so when the head came off you

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:20.760
could hear the shearing of metal and then like a shaft of light kind of going

01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:28.840
into the into the the neck hole there I vomit on the thing you sure do I put my

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:32.600
fingers I hold his hair

01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:41.800
you guys are real friends you guys don't understand you guys are not there for

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:49.600
him you're not there for him like I am how does he have to sit in the backseat

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:55.080
are you okay are you all right so is it as much as my character understand maybe

01:34:55.080 --> 01:35:01.960
I could I if I were to go toward the light sure but I gotta were you vomiting

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:11.200
into the neck hole yes okay yeah so you look up towards this light and then you

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:16.680
get you get vomit all splattered around you guys get what's happening I don't

01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:20.920
know how to explain it any better did Christopher just vomit all over Sharpie

01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:25.320
yeah yeah yeah so Christopher can just vomit voluntarily no he showed his

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:30.640
fingers down his mouth yeah all right fingers I don't know no he's the

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:36.880
bulimic well there you go now how does what does it do to the floating thing in

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:40.440
there like how does the vomit interact with the glowing oh you're trying to hit

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:47.480
the glowing yeah I'm trying to see if it's hot well that's wait what just let

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:52.240
him go with this this is actually a really good idea like this the vomit

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:58.880
sizzle okay okay okay the only way to detect temperature I mean it's not the

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:04.800
only it's certainly the most efficient before you answer I start I start peeing

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:11.320
on it but I'm a lady so I have to hike up my skirt or something what do I do

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:16.200
yeah I like your skirt up for you I got my skirt and then I just kind of I I'm

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.440
standing on a shoulder and where the head fell I just pee off the shoulder down

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:23.440
toward the head as I just start peeing on this ever seeing any steam coming up

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:30.440
no okay so well you guys the only you guys both missed your peas so did you

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:33.800
roll about our kids I rolled it you rolled a pee check I rolled it it's a

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:40.720
dexterity but yeah but but Christopher however does vomit directly onto the

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:48.560
surface of this crystal it's not all for nothing it doesn't sizzle really it

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:55.920
doesn't sizzle am I emerging from the neck and seeing this thing oh is that

01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:59.880
was are you gonna yeah you're clampering up on yeah I'd like to yeah

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:06.880
yeah you clamber up it's a bit tough cuz you're all slick with vomit doesn't make

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:09.160
any sense I'm sorry I don't mean to

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:18.000
I was floating in the middle of this neck hole so he puked into the neck

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.620
hole some of it got on this crystal the rest of it spired relative to the

01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:26.880
golems body it's essentially floating hovering in mid-neck hole mid-neck

01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:30.760
hole yeah yeah is it within reach like it's brain I know how much you hate it

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:35.080
when I try to get well why would the brain be in his neck hole yeah why well

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:38.960
because his head's off now but this thing remains yeah it's floating mid-neck

01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:44.560
hole yeah mid-neck hole could be his Adam's apple where is it or down in the

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:48.840
know like right right at the neck collar yeah guys I think it's the carotid

01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:57.720
amethyst it's a topaz if I know my golem right so you are you up out out of

01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:02.440
the neck yeah I'm up in the neck area you burst forth I'd like to touch this

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:07.640
topaz vomit right that was your question um the whole the this hole is

01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:11.840
about a five foot radius so you'd have to stretch like pretty pretty far to

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:16.560
reach that thing I extend him a hand and let him lean out so he can touch the

01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:23.280
topaz all right unless I cast I don't have it why don't you just cast teamwork

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:29.240
fine the greatest spell of all

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:38.640
anyway working together you manage to reach out and grasp this this is a power

01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:44.360
crystal of some sort you grab it it feels like it's being held in place with

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:48.000
like a magnetic kind of force but as you grab it it kind of goes away like it

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:53.200
won't you know get stuck there how big is this thing like a pretty small like

01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:56.920
maybe the size of an eyeball oh he puked on it but it's the size of an eye yeah

01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:00.320
that's why it didn't like yeah he only puked on it with a little bit of you the

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:05.400
rest of it was free to splatter a human eyeball right you shrunk it different

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:13.040
different thing not the heart not the heart topaz so this is the gong is the

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:17.560
gong moving still or is it doing while we do this to it I mean this hasn't

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:22.960
taken too long I guess vomiting inducing vomiting is only a few seconds true it's

01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:28.760
been a bit momentarily stunned by by the loss of its head you don't it hasn't

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:36.080
started moving since this fuck up those topaz man yeah can we just grab the

01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:40.560
topaz and throw it throw it away he grabbed it so you're you've grabbed it

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:44.440
holding on to it is like holding my weight or no no that's the thing oh I

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:49.840
got it yeah you got it I put it back in not to the shoulder area I put it in my

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:55.240
pocket okay that happens you pull each other in and you pocket the thing is the

01:39:55.240 --> 01:40:01.640
gong so moving it is so it hasn't moved since being decapitated that's that's

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:06.400
funny over here come on no no nothing nothing are you simply having a

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:11.280
wonderful Christmas time yeah I just think it's fine yeah I I climbed down in

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:14.800
his back like is he wearing clothing of some sort as it was skin or what's what

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:19.800
he's got like metal metal shell wearing a ladder

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:26.800
no well now we know yeah it's a great question I slide down this back and

01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:29.840
grab like grab around the waist and just kind of like as a joke kind of look up

01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:36.760
it's that kind of dry humping him from behind yeah yeah I get I get out of it

01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:42.520
and I so now am I in the the keep the where we fought Admiral Darkstar am I

01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:47.280
yep the level right before the level you were yeah this is the level with all

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:51.640
those bodies I guess all the blood buckets yeah I walk over to a window and

01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:58.640
I look out of it you do that you can see just like snow and whiteness it's no

01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:06.720
yeah can I climb down and push the goal golem over yeah wait wait wait I'm

01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:12.680
still up here oh I'm sorry come down let's go down together okay okay you walk

01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:16.480
down together I stay on I stay on if I want to be on him when he goes over

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:21.120
because I'm still fucking him you push one ankle I'll push the other so we

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:26.280
push over the golem in unison you push the golems ankles and at first it

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:32.280
begins to creak and then totter a bit maybe and then topple in fact topple

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:40.800
over in a pile of clanging clanging metal happens happens okay I touch the

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:45.200
frosted glass at the window I'm standing in as I look out at the fresh new

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:52.960
fallen snow and I think about family and I think about a little baby born in a

01:41:52.960 --> 01:42:05.960
manger I start telling everybody how Christmas comes from mushrooms you make

01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:15.760
several cogent points I examine I examine the room for doors other ways of

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:22.240
egress the only way through this door is a large metal hatch in the floor I

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:28.240
examine it it's a large and metal Chris de Burgh you're a rogue you're good at

01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:34.720
doors get over here and try to open this thing okay I go over to the door and I

01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:42.160

01:42:54.360 --> 01:43:03.640
house man for you don't want me to cook for you man hey don't get the door I

01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:11.600
think my grandmother's coming let the dog out okay I'm expecting a package

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:20.360
no no I use what I use my thieving skills to analyze the door to make sure

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:25.360
it's not trapped or to see if they if it's a trap door nice certainly not

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:30.160
trapped although you're not quite sure how it opens there's got to be stuff

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:35.040
you'd say when you were investigating and examining this door it seems like a

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:39.880
classic big heavy metal door it doesn't appear to be trapped as many of the

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:49.120
doors that I've seen before the door is fine everybody let's pull it up grab it

01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:56.080
grab that door so we I try to pull the door up you try but you fail it it seems

01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:02.240
like it's some sort of sliding rather than a swinging actuating hinge like the

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:08.920
door I slide the door you slide the door and below it you see only lava I

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:16.960
puke on it yeah it's sizzles we you enter the hot lava is it hot yeah yeah

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:25.040
very okay good now we know I told you guys yeah puke sizzles when I'm on

01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:33.240
your side so we beat Admiral Darkstar and we beat him we came to his place we

01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:37.280
kicked his ass we're done right we're walking around we're looking through

01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:44.120
lava doors but the truth is we beat this guy one we you want to celebrate well I

01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:50.080
know I'm just saying like like what if we just said to you three weeks later no

01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:59.400
they were all found dead I guess we do have to make our way out of this

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:02.640
building fine well it just seems like a little expensive the only way out of

01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:06.640
this building is the lava door on the floor are there any lava boats no

01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:11.640
there's no lava boats yeah the only other thing is a staircase but it goes

01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:15.960
up ways it doesn't go down ways I go up the staircase and check it out I go up

01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:19.960
that's that that floor where you saw Admiral Darkstar there's a dark pillar

01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:26.080
of black blackened crystal and big hole on the floor where that robot arm came

01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:31.040
out yeah so what else are we sure Admiral Darkstar is dead I mean who's sure of

01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:35.840
anything man I don't think he's right I don't think he's dead I think this is

01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:39.120
only one way to find out

01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:49.040
is there a body there's no other no other there's no windows doors in this

01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:54.680
room there's just stairs windows yeah there's snow outside yeah well so you

01:45:54.680 --> 01:46:01.720
just can we go through the window and and down into the snow you try no no

01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:07.720
there isn't is there a servant of the floor land conscious I mean I run over

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:12.520
to a possible unconscious servant tonight rouse him or her wait why do you rouse

01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:20.680
wait well you're gonna wake him up right away let's puke on him yeah yeah I

01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:25.120
want to I want to go over to one of these windows how far down is it outside it's

01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:33.400
several hundred feet how about how much feather I have 150 feet of rope it says

01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:37.400
on here yeah so we can use the rope to climb down are we trying to get out of

01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:45.760
here that's my instinct so we push I take the servants unconscious body and I

01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:51.680
push him out of the window you don't see the servant there's no sir no there is

01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:59.320
no servant sir there there certainly was he's gone I mean yeah people move it's

01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:04.560
crazy and jump through the window and cast feather fall all right that happens

01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:10.480
now I climb down I have a hundred feet of rope and I tie it out to you great

01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:14.640
you're the only source of casting feather fall on people and you're the

01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:21.960
first one out the door oh I can I can cast on them the guy who builds parachutes

01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:24.960
I didn't know I can even cast it on other people

01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:29.720
hey yeah okay we're good together Chris de Burgh so Sharpie the rope bring him

01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:34.280
back up and let's try this again yeah back to one everybody yeah but I'm why

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:38.600
don't we just go down my rope yeah and and then go down my rope it's several

01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:43.160
hundred feet well I've got one hundred and I have a hundred fifty feet we tie

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:46.720
the rope let's just get Sharpie back up here make him build us magic parachutes

01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:51.560
well I gotta climb up oh but he's open then your role yeah we don't have enough

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:55.120
rope to even get him back up here well he's feather falling he's not falling

01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:59.400
too fast I make a lasso and I throw I throw it down to catch him as he

01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:05.240
feather falls are we gonna swing from him falling yeah okay all right you

01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:09.760
throw him the rope and you catch the rope if you want to I mean if you don't

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:15.480
it's like fuck it yeah I catch it thank you so we pull him back up because

01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:20.840
he's got a cat's feather falling he feels as light as a feather so we pull

01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:25.840
him pull him up back to that I don't want to go back up I come up for two

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:30.560
seconds and you're the guy that can get us all down okay just hanging out here

01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:38.240
okay okay also guys I turn them and say look it's it's getting late and it's

01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:44.520
Christmas time and I feel like you know we don't know whether whether or not the

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:47.760
Sun will come out tomorrow whether Admiral Darkstar is gonna come get us

01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:54.240
