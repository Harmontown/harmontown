{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:24.000\nHello and all, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:34.000\nOh yeah, I have a very good feeling about this one.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:40.000\nMy name is Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:50.000\nBut more to the point, let's talk about the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:55.000\nThank you.\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:59.000\nWow, you're a lively crowd. I feel obligated to reciprocate your energy.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:05.000\nI don't want to act how I feel.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:06.000\nHow do you feel?\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:08.000\nIn contrast to their jubilance.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:11.000\nLugubrias, lethargic, laconic.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:18.000\nI feel like Dan Harmon, but you guys feel like Joey from Friends.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:25.000\nYou're like a golden doodle. You want to just fetch the rope in the front yard.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:27.000\nI think you just called them stupid twice.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:30.000\nI'm sorry about that. I'm sorry.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:32.000\nAdorable but stupid.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:36.000\nNo, but I'm convinced that, no, no, no, no, I didn't mean that.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:41.000\nYou're filled with a life that only a god could embody.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:48.000\nI'm not going to let him like, maybe you are stupid. It doesn't matter.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:50.000\nMaybe stupid is what you're supposed to be.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:55.000\nMaybe being smart isn't a good idea. What does being smart mean?\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:57.000\nKnowing more about how we're going to die.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:01.000\nIsn't that what we've all found out as we've gotten smarter?\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:08.000\nDon't we just figure out more and more about how we're dying?\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:12.000\nDidn't dumb people at the beginning of human civilization,\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:17.000\nwhen the life expectancy was 25, didn't everybody think they were going to live forever?\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nIsn't that why they did so much dumb shit?\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:24.000\nBecause they thought that gods walked among them and they thought it was okay to abuse each other and themselves.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:29.000\nBecause they thought that even though they only lived to 30 before they got eaten by a saber-toothed tiger,\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:33.000\nthat they were destined for greater things and that they never really died.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:39.000\nAnd didn't we slowly uncover the fact that we were actually only going to live for a certain amount of time\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:42.000\nand then evaporate into the cosmos?\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:44.000\nAnd didn't we uncover those stones?\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:47.000\nDidn't we figure out ways to keep us alive a little bit longer, ironically?\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:51.000\nLike, oh, also if you take vitamin C, you won't get scurvy.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:57.000\nSo we slowly extended the lifespan of an intelligent species to around 80.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:01.000\nAnd we spend those 80 years knowing that life means nothing.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nOh, shit.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:07.000\nWe evolved from a species of puppy dogs, you know?\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:13.000\nWe used to just be these weird toga-wearing, like, murderers.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:17.000\nJust run around in the dirt alleys just going like,\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:20.000\nAh, Zeus says I can stick a dick in this tree.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:24.000\nJust a bunch of toga-wearing Matt LeBlancs running around.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:27.000\nYeah.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:31.000\nThat's the best character on Friends, right, Joey?\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:33.000\nThat's the guy you want to be.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:38.000\nThat was the Troy, in community terms, like the kind of like, just a dog, you know?\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:43.000\nHe's like, he loves, he's innocent and sort of looks at things in terms of vertically.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:46.000\nSalt must be better than pepper or vice versa.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:48.000\nThere is no salt and pepper.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:50.000\nThat's what I always said about the Troy character.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nI said, this is a guy who you have to imagine.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:59.000\nLike, don't judge any of these characters, but the character of Troy knows that there's 26 letters in the alphabet\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:03.000\nand he knows which letter is more awesome than which.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:06.000\nHe doesn't look at it like, like just a line.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:08.000\nHe has, and it's not A through Z.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:10.000\nIt's like, it's all jumbled up.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:16.000\nLike, he thinks that C is more awesome because it's like shaped like in a more awesome way.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:18.000\nBut D's above it.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:20.000\nAnyways, what am I talking about?\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\nSorry, your energy, your energy.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:24.000\nLet me reward your energy.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:26.000\nWhat do I got to do?\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:28.000\nI'll tell you what you shouldn't do.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:31.000\nYou shouldn't do what you did in the green room.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:34.000\nI came into the green room, ladies and gentlemen, moments ago,\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:38.000\nand could smell Dan's shit from outside the green room though.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:45.000\nAnd I came in there and it was, it was heavy.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:49.000\nI made a boo boo.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:50.000\nAnd you weren't there.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:53.000\nI came in, Dan wasn't there, and I assumed Dan got here,\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:57.000\ntook a shit, and then quit Harmontown.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:02.000\nBecause if I had taken the shit that he took, I would have quit Harmontown.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:05.000\nAnd so would you have.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:12.000\nLike, while I was doing it, I actually looked up and looked around for vents and stuff.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nHave you ever done that?\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:17.000\nThat's like, you have to be 40 or above to like,\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:21.000\nwhile you're taking a crap, like, actually start inspecting the infrastructure.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:25.000\nI bet, I bet this is going to be a problem.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:29.000\nI think I'm pooping in a, in someone's garage.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:32.000\nI think I'm going to ruin the party.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nYeah, it's bad back there.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:35.000\nThe green room is not green.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:36.000\nDo you feel better now? You all right?\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nI feel great.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:46.000\nI feel emotionally bereft and, yeah, but gastrointestinally clear.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:50.000\nAnyways, let's keep, don't do that.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nI'm a bad person. I took stinky shits.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:56.000\nNobody here has ever taken a stinky shit and bummed anybody out, right?\n\n05:56.000 --> 06:00.000\nNo, you're all angels. You're all wonderful millennial angels.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:05.000\nYou believe in civic service. You vote for politicians.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nYou believe in causes. You have Facebook causes.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:12.000\nYou're going to make everything great with your comments and your comment sections.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:15.000\nYou're not Generation X. You're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:19.000\nYou're wonderful people. You don't understand why Instagram would have ads.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:23.000\nShame on them.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:26.000\nYou made Instagram with your Instagrams.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nWhere are these ads going to come from?\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:35.000\nI'm not going to Instagram anymore. I'm a millennial.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nI hate the millennials, Jeff.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.000\nI don't even know if they're millennials or not.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nI hate whoever's younger than them.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:46.000\nI'm a little embarrassed to even admit that I don't know what a millennial is.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nI guess it's just whatever is after it.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:51.000\nBaby boomer, Generation X, millennial. That's what it is.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:56.000\nAbove the baby boomers, it's Graham and Grandpa, the Guadalcanal, the greatest generation.\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:02.000\nThe people that actually did shit and are now dead because they did shit.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:08.000\nAnd if they're left alive, they're going like, so the Japanese are good now?\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:14.000\nAnd I'm supposed to care why? And we're like, Grandpa.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:18.000\nRob Reiner was like, ma-ha, and those are baby boomers.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:22.000\nRob Reiner on All in the Family, Sally Struthers, those are the baby boomers.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:25.000\nNow Generation X is 40, me.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nI'm one of the younger Generation Xers, you two.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:32.000\nWe're actually the Generation X, depending on who you ask, Douglas Copeland, whoever.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:35.000\nThat Generation, you don't pinpoint this stuff.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:39.000\nIt's not like everyone gets together like an Ender's Game and has some brood.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:45.000\nBut you go by these sort of sine waves, and I don't want to buy into this shit anymore than anyone else.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:53.000\nHowever, I do feel like when I listen to today's 13-year-old talk, I do hear my mom.\n\n07:53.000 --> 08:00.000\nAnd I do think that these star children, these fucking new babies that are coming up,\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:03.000\nI do think they're full of shit.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:07.000\nI think that they love, like, unity.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:10.000\nI think they love, they don't have that.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:16.000\nI feel like baby boomers were sort of typified by, oh, we landed on the moon, we wood stocked,\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:19.000\nwe stock hopped, we Billy Joel'd, we did everything.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:22.000\nHey, Billy Joel'd!\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:27.000\nDan, don't include Billy Joel with wood stock in the space program.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:32.000\nAlright, you're right. He did not start the fire.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:37.000\nI listened to that song today, it was like, you had to be a big shot.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:40.000\nRemember that song where it was like, we didn't start the fire?\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nThere's a part where it's like, children of thalidomide.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:47.000\nOw, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:51.000\nIt's just funny to me that there's a song where you follow the phrase children of thalidomide\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:54.000\nwith like a hot sizzling guitar riff.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:57.000\nThalidomide, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:04.000\nAnyways, where was I? Baby boomers with the thing, and we're the David Cross generation.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:08.000\nWe keep our flannel tight, we keep our hands in our pockets, we don't look.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:14.000\nWe were like, fuck you, fuck everything, fuck, fuck, fuck everything that has a gimmick, fuck it all.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:21.000\nThat's not culture either, but we had one thing, we perfected one thing, integrity.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:31.000\nHow dare you scoff at that? I heard a full blown like, yeah, that was Adam Goldberg.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:35.000\nA full blown rap. No, fuck you, yeah, integrity.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:39.000\nAre you talking about Mr. Integrity, Adam Goldberg?\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:49.000\nLike, the idea, like, that's all you have going for you if you sit in the corner of the room and go like, fuck this, fuck that, fuck it.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:53.000\nYou may be part of the problem, you may not be a hero ever in your life,\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:58.000\nbut at least you know, you know who you are and you know what you ain't doing\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:01.000\nand you're not playing into any, like, larger hand.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:06.000\nAnd I think that because now those people are having children and are kind of going,\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nI don't know, what do you want to do?\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nLike, these 13 year olds have these, like, little textures in their hands\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:16.000\nand they're kind of like, they're so excited about this idea that we can all be one\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:21.000\nand we can all unite and we can all recycle and we can all refreeze the polar ice caps\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:27.000\nbut the general, like, result is that they're just intolerable fucking cocks.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nWait, 13 year olds?\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nYeah, yeah, that's right.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:36.000\nFirst, I want to be the Ben Franklin of hating 13 year olds.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:41.000\nI'm telling you, we've got six years left to kick their asses.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:44.000\nThey're going to be driving soon.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:47.000\nWhat was the last encounter you had with a 13 year old?\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nYeah, Dino's kid.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nI don't know.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:54.000\nIt's only what I read online.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nI don't know.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nIt's comment sections, mainly.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:01.000\nI just assume all those people are 12.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:05.000\nI assume everyone online is 12, but they're all 40, just like us.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:08.000\nBut what about Sexy 12?\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:11.000\n42.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:14.000\nOkay, fine, you caught me.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:17.000\nI don't know anything I'm talking about.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:20.000\nThat's a millennial way of thinking, right there.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nI used to play...\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:27.000\nIn Generation X, you used to be able to just say shit and get away with it.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:31.000\nJust shit in an American flag and throw it out the window.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:34.000\nYou're saying that Generation X had integrity?\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nYeah, that's right.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nWe didn't do anything.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:40.000\nThat's right, that's why we had integrity.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nAs you said, and I...\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:45.000\nHere's some things we didn't do. Watergate!\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nWe didn't do that.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nWe wouldn't do it.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:56.000\nWe did allow our country to go to war several times,\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:59.000\nand we kept our flannel tight and our hands in our pockets.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nYeah, but we said it was lame.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.000\nA really flaccid and effectual generation, I would say.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:12.000\nAlso, let's put a fine point on it.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:16.000\nThe 90s, would that be Generation X's music, maybe?\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:17.000\nYeah.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nThe worst music.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.000\nBut it had integrity.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:22.000\nRight now, right now.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:25.000\nNo, it didn't, because right now, if you turn on satellite Sirius XM radio,\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:29.000\nand you turn on the 90s station, a shitty song is playing.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:33.000\nAnd that is a fucking guarantee.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:37.000\nJeff, would a shitty generation have the self-awareness\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:42.000\nand self-effacement to have a pocket full of its own kryptonite?\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nThat's something that millennials won't do.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:50.000\nAll they want to do is bring sexy back.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:53.000\nAnd bringing sexy back, I got a pocket full of kryptonite!\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:56.000\nIt's deep!\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nI don't want to talk about it anymore.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:01.000\nAnd when I don't want to talk about something, we don't talk about it,\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nbecause I'm Generation X,\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:06.000\nand you millennials can go fuck yourselves,\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nbecause you're 13 and you're 25,\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:11.000\nand I don't know what I'm talking about,\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nbut I don't have to,\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:16.000\nbecause I'm 40.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:20.000\nDan, I think what you're trying to say is that you want them to get off your lawn.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nYeah.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\nYeah.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nYou work hard in that lawn every weekend.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:26.000\nYeah, that's right.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nYou're not there with your lawn mower and your mulch?\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nYeah, I earned it.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nYour lawn has integrity.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:33.000\nYeah.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nAnd these millennials are stomping all over it.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.000\nThey're stomping all my lawn with their comments section.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.000\nAnd they're frisbees, and they're hula hoops, and they're whatnot.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:42.000\nWho cares if Instagram's going to have ads?\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:45.000\nWhat did you ever do for Instagram, you fucks?\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nWait, Dan!\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:50.000\nI was disgusted, America.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nI was disgusted.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nInstagram said, we're going to have ads now.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:59.000\nI was disgusted by your response, you guys.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:04.000\nIt sounds like you're the one disgusted by ads on Instagram.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:06.000\nNo, I'm not.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:10.000\nLook, I'm just doing Instagram because I want people to look at my dog.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:13.000\nMy dog's sometimes cute when he's sleeping.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:17.000\nInstagram's where I know that 12,000 people will look at it.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:20.000\nI don't care if it says Nike above it or it doesn't.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:23.000\nIf it does, tough titties for me.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nI guess it's hard to run Instagram.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:26.000\nI'm Generation X.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nI know what's up.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:31.000\nIt's hard to make an Instagram.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nYou guys were born into it.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nIt was Insta for you.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:38.000\nIt's already lame to say you're 40 and Gen X.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nThat's already lame.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:43.000\nHey, baby boomers came up with that name.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:44.000\nDid they?\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nWe just didn't reinvent it.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nWe called Generation Y, Generation Y.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:52.000\nGeneration Y, like baby boomers, went, I prefer millennials.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:53.000\nIs that true?\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nSure, yes.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:58.000\nI don't know what's true.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:01.000\nGeneration X is called Generation X\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:05.000\nbecause the baby boomers said, you're like Generation X.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:08.000\nAnd we went, I don't care.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:11.000\nAnd then the next generation came along and they went, name me.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nAnd we went, I don't know, why?\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:17.000\nAnd they were like, no, no, star babies.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:22.000\nAnd we went on a Trivial Pursuit Edition.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nBecause we have an identity.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:29.000\nWhat would the trivia categories be on the pie of Generation Y?\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:39.000\nConscientiousness, words that hurt,\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:43.000\nfairies, different fairies.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:47.000\nProbably something about vampires and werewolves.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:53.000\nBloodthirsty monsters that don't have fangs anymore.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nAll right, what are we moving on to?\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nI don't know.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:02.000\nYou really are a grumpy old man.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:09.000\nYou took a huge shit and you came at her and you're now here.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\nI think we do have a special guest.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:14.000\nI don't want to put her on the spot, but Erin made a new friend tonight.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:18.000\nShe was at Kamikaze, which is Stan Lee's convention.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nShe did a panel with some ladies.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:23.000\nI don't know what the panel was called, ladies of powerful ladies.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:26.000\nI don't know, sexy ladies, I have no idea.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:27.000\nMy girlfriend was on it.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:32.000\nBut she made friends with a pioneer of what is now a comedic institution,\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nwhich is kind of an interesting thing.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:37.000\nYou don't know if she's here?\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:40.000\nIf I just awkwardly say...\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:46.000\nHillary Clinton, everybody, please bring her up.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nDid Lorraine Newman make it tonight?\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nNo.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nOkay.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nWow.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:59.000\nWho is that guy that's such an expert at her not making it?\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nThis is like a big Mr. Clean guy.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nNo.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nI would know.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:08.000\nThat's Chevy Chase back there.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nI was hoping to talk to her a little bit about our mutual.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nYeah, we both worked with him.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nWait, so Lorraine Newman was going to be here?\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:15.000\nYeah, she made friends with Erin.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:16.000\nShe's a delightful lady.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:17.000\nAnd then she came to the green room.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:18.000\nShe smelled that giant...\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:19.000\nYeah, we made best friends there.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:22.000\nShe smelled your giant shit and she fucking phoned out.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:28.000\nI probably fucking smoked her out with my big gross fucking McDonald's poop.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:31.000\nLorraine Newman, if you're out there, thank you for not coming.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:35.000\nYou would have only smelled my poop.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:38.000\nI would love to meet Lorraine Newman.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nYeah, no, it'd be interesting to talk to her just a little bit.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:46.000\nI don't know how sick she is of talking about SNL, but she was there in 1975\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:50.000\nat the beginning of what is now the exon of comedy.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:54.000\nBut when it wasn't the exon of comedy, when it was a variety show,\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nit was just a variety show.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:57.000\nIt was live.\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:59.000\nIt wasn't meant to be archived and, you know,\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\noh, this is Coneheads number three.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:02.000\nThis is Coneheads number four.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:06.000\nIt was the first NBC show to fire its creator and bring him back.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:10.000\nYes, yes, yes.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nBack when that was cool.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:16.000\nYeah, back when that resulted in success.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:19.000\nThat was the first time.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:24.000\nBut in lieu of that, I don't know, man,\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:27.000\nthis is a Tupperware container in the back of the fridge\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nthat has got a lot of different colors\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:33.000\nthat I can see through the translucent body.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nJeff, I don't go on Reddit anymore,\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nand I don't go on...\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:41.000\nWell, hold your applause,\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nbecause this is a segment of the show\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.000\ncalled Because I Don't Go On Reddit Anymore,\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:48.000\nWhat the Fuck Is Going On On Reddit?\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:51.000\nBecause I get tweeted things.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nI got tweeted, Jeff.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:56.000\nDo you know what a subreddit is?\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:59.000\nLook, I've gone on Reddit twice,\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nand I don't understand what the ups and the downs\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nand there's a little picture of a Martian,\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nand I don't know what's going on.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nIt's millennial shit.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nYeah.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nThey think that's changing the world.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:09.000\nWait, so you're going on...\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nIt's not a regular forum,\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nbecause depending on whether people like what you wrote or not,\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:15.000\nit moves up and down.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\nSo if I look at it one day and then go back the next day,\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:20.000\nit's all in a different order based on its own popularity?\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:21.000\nYeah.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nGay.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nDownvote.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:31.000\nAlright, so...\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:32.000\nAnd I mean gay in a Gen X,\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:35.000\nI don't care if gay is bad gay.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nNot your millennial,\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:41.000\noh, come on, man, bullying shit, man.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nIntegrity.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:46.000\nThat's not integrity, it's just coping a...\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:47.000\nWait, I'm sorry.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nI don't even know what you're talking about.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nNo, we're not good people, but we think...\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:52.000\nNo, I'm not saying we're not good people.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nThat's so retarded.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nThat's not integrity, that's just...\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nIntegrity doesn't mean good person.\n\n19:58.000 --> 19:59.000\nIntegrity means...\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:00.000\nNo, it does, that's exactly what it means.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:01.000\nIntegral.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:02.000\nIntegral.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:03.000\nTo what?\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nTo what?\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nTo oneself.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:07.000\nSelf-contained.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:08.000\nSelf-contained.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:09.000\nIntegrity.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:10.000\nI know who I am.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:12.000\nSo we're self-contained assholes.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:13.000\nYeah, sure.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:14.000\nAlright, so you're not...\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nYou know what, some of us are self-contained good people.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:19.000\nKurt Cobain.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:22.000\nHe seemed alright.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:23.000\nOn the inside?\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:26.000\nSeemed, yeah.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nI don't know, he seemed like a good guy to me.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nHe seemed like he had integrity.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nHow many of today's artists have the balls\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nto blow their brains out?\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nBecause they're popular.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nOr how many artists today have the balls\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nto marry somebody who hires somebody\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nto blow their brains out?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:49.000\nNo.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:52.000\nShe had him killed, come on.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nShe fucking had that dude killed.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:55.000\nIt's not ours to say.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nIt's mine to say.\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:00.000\nBecause you have integrity.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:06.000\nThat's my point.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:10.000\nCherry snacks, baby.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nWe're not going to go down as the coolest generation\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.000\nwhen...\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nWe're not even going to make the top ten\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:18.000\nin this century.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:20.000\nOh, that's true.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:23.000\nBut we did open the roads\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:26.000\nto trade agreements with China\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nin our own way.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nWhen you say we, you mean you and me?\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:31.000\nYeah.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nWell, you and me and Doug Benson.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:36.000\nNo, baby boomers did that on our watch.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:38.000\nWell, they loosened the mayonnaise jar.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:40.000\nBut Generation X really,\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nreally drove it home with China.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nWait, we are the reason why\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\nIron Man 3\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nhad a special segment in it where\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nIron Man lands in China and says,\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nI love China.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nThat was our doing.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nHow was this generation?\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nDoes Gen X like China?\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nWe have now come to terms with the fact\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:02.000\nthat we have to like them.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:04.000\nTo the point where we re-edited Red Dawn\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:07.000\nand airbrushed out all the Chinese flags\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\ninto North Korean flags.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nYeah.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nGeneration X is the generation\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.000\nthat has now come to terms with China.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:16.000\nCome to terms with it.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:19.000\nThe way Newton came to terms with gravity.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:21.000\nThis exists.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nChina exists.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nWe are the Marco Polo of...\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:27.000\nIntegrity.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nPeople in a world where China's\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:31.000\nalready been discovered.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:33.000\nWhat were we talking about?\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:35.000\nA new segment called...\n\n22:35.000 -->

31:29.000\nBecause we thought Kurt Loder was\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nas good as it got.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nNo, we didn't.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nYes, we did, Jeff!\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\nStop, don't be a fucking cell out.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nNo, Dan, stop tying me to fucking Kurt Loder.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nJeff, you loved him.\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nPlease welcome to the stage Kurt Loder.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nI'm here.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nI don't...\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nLAUGHTER\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nKurt Loder.\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nWhat does that guy do wrong?\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nHe did nothing wrong, but he didn't\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nspeak for us.\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nI wasn't saying he was the Walter Cronkite\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nof our generation.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nThat was the implication.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nWhat Adam was saying, what I'm extrapolating\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nfrom that, is that\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\na huge technological\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\nthreshold that we crossed between these\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\ngenerations, depending on where you draw the line,\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nis that we went from passive\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\none-way transmission into\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\ninteractive.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nWe have a generation that's grown up on the internet.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nThat means that they get to say\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nsomething back.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nIt doesn't fucking matter to Rupert Murdoch\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nwhat they have to say,\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nbut we have to all deal with each other\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nin this swirly, eyes-wide shut toilet\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nof everyone saying back\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nto each other.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nAnd Gen Xers are coming from a place of like,\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\na big day.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nYou did what you had to do,\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nand you put yourself out there.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nIf somebody had something to say back,\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nit got back to you\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nthrough less channels,\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nthinner, fiber-optic lines.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nAnd now we're all swimming around\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nin this turd pit.\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nIt used to take real effort to threaten a celebrity.\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nYou need to find out their address.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nYou need to get to the post office, get a stamp.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nAnd now it's just a few\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:07.000\nclicks on your phone.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nThat has a deeper effect\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nthan just being allowing us to yell at each other\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\na little louder.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nMy big concern is the\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\npsychological or philosophical,\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nmaybe you would call it,\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nthe impact of people feeling like\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\nit's revolutionary\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nto use\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nthat medium\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nto police each other\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nwhen\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nin my day, Kurt Loder\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\ntold kids what to dance to.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nAnd there was a president above him\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nwho went to war with all the countries\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nand launched the Tom Hawk missiles.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nNobody ever questioned the politician.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nYou're exactly right.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nThat's not how MTV worked, because it had nothing to do\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nwith what the president did above him.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nBut Kurt Loder told the kids\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nwhat to think and what to feel,\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nand the kids told Kurt Loder whether or not\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nhe was full of shit, and you reacted to Kurt Loder\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nby getting your haircut different from Kurt Loder\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nor getting your haircut the same as Kurt Loder,\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nand nothing ever affected the fucking president.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nFlash forward to today where you have a president,\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nand instead of Kurt Loder,\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nyou have 8 million fucking YouTube channels.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\nYou have a bunch of people swirling around each other.\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nWhat you don't have is anybody\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nasking what the fuck the president is doing.\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nThat's why it's a little infuriating to me\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\nthat the toilet underneath\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nwhat used to be Kurt Loder is now\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nconsumed with policing each other.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nIt's like they've tricked us into\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nlike self-hatred, which is a common thing\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nthat happens all the time.\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nWe're like, are you racist?\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nAre you sexist? Are you...\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nWe're gonna do this dance forever?\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nReally? Like, like, like, like...\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nYeah, everyone wants to squeebsquab everyone else.\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\nYeah. But I'd like to...\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nI'm alarmed about it because\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nthey...\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:47.000\nthey turned the key on the internet.\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:49.000\nThey're like, here we go everybody,\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:51.000\nhere's the internet, and the government\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.000\nmust have been like, holy shit, what the fuck\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\nare they gonna do?\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nAnd they crossed their fingers\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nand closed their eyes, and then they slowly\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nand all they heard was got milk ads.\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nWhat's up? What's up?\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nIt's a super friend's doing what's up.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nBut between Kurt Loder and the internet\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nthere was a show called TRL.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nTotal Request, one woo for TRL,\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nwhich is accurate.\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\nTotal Request Live was the bridge between\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nmass culture and prescribed culture.\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\nYes, because you could totally request. Live.\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nPeople would go to New York and make part of their visits\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nstanding outside MTV Studios\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.000\nsaying, I need to hear bye-bye-bye.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nI need to hear bye-bye-bye.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nTechnology which had never existed on Good Morning America.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nYeah.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nWell, but now there's nothing like that\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nbecause you can watch music videos whenever you want.\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\nYou don't have to hear a snippet\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nof 98 degrees' new hit.\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nAnd you don't have music video\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\ntelevision telling you\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nwhether or not this is a hot record\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nor something that's going to be into the pit.\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\nBut that affects consumption. It doesn't affect\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\nhow we react to the people who live behind these marble walls.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nNo, it's not a wealth\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\npoverty dynamic. It's a person\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nto listener dynamic.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nIsn't that crazy? Isn't that weird?\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nIsn't that weird?\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.000\nThe ability for all of us to talk to each other\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nall of a sudden has absolutely no impact\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nabove a certain level.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nIt didn't.

I think those guys are\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nmaybe some of them were Christian.\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nStephen Colbert is a fucking Christian.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nBut\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nI also think they're logicians.\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:51.000\nThey have to be.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.000\nThey are pragmatic people.\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nDan, can we get back to\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nthe thing I started this all was you saying\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nthat you are now not on subreddit, you're not on\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\nthe internet anymore? Well that's because\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nI'm hurting people every time I get on the internet.\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nSo no Twitter, no Facebook? Twitter is fine.\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nTwitter seems to be doing fine.\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nSo I put\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\npictures of my dog on Instagram and I'm on\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nTwitter and then on Tumblr\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:15.000\nand people can\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.000\nsend me messages and\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.000\nthese kids send me messages\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:21.000\nand sometimes they say\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nI'm gay and I want to kill myself and I can\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:25.000\nwrite them back privately if they wrote privately\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.000\nand go don't do that. Keep being gay.\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nIt sounds like you missed out on everyone\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nafter that episode where you felt that\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nyou were hurting someone. Everyone's like no I want Dan Harmon\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:35.000\nto keep talking. Yeah it was like 98%\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nDan Rose.\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:39.000\nWell there's a polarizing effect of that\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:41.000\nstuff. You know what you have to do\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:43.000\nin those moments? You have to shoot straight through\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nthe middle and I don't want to\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nget warped by that idea.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nI just felt like, I don't know, you follow your\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:51.000\nbliss. My bliss is not\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nhanging out on there. I'm not doing it passive\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\naggressively. How was anybody's bliss\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nliving in a fucking comment\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nsection? I can't understand it. Exactly\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nI mean I was born in 1973\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nI'm an old, funny daddy. Get off my lawn\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nyou whippersnappers. But fucking\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\ncomment sections is just a bunch of fucking\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.000\nanger, a bunch of misguided\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nspleen for no reason. Well I\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nthink it would be sarcastic like me in trying to\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nget a reaction. I will answer that question Jeff.\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:17.000\nAdam you at Mad with Power\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:19.000\nyou were in control of something and the first time\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nsomebody reminded you of\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:23.000\nyourself you\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:25.000\nsnuffed them out like a cigarette. It's an\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.000\nugly, ugly world.\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:29.000\nAnd the reason I looked at Reddit\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:31.000\nI went down a thing and some things\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:33.000\npeople say very sweet things. Sometimes people say\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.000\nI don't like it. Here's wine. It's very\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nsuccinct and very well worded and lovely\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nbut mostly it's just a bunch of spiraling\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nnonsense and I'm not trying to\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\nstop what's going on here\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nbut watching four men talk about religion\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nand politics is like the fucking\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\nlike it's all guys do. Guys get together\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:51.000\nwe have a couple drinks and we try to\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nnot like girls.\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nWe haven't even talked about Jesus's shoes\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:57.000\nwhich are fantastic but I did mention\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:59.000\nyou sure.
