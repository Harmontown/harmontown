00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
Hello and all, Harmontown is now in session.

00:24.000 --> 00:34.000
Oh yeah, I have a very good feeling about this one.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
My name is Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.

00:40.000 --> 00:50.000
But more to the point, let's talk about the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Thank you.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Wow, you're a lively crowd. I feel obligated to reciprocate your energy.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
I don't want to act how I feel.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
How do you feel?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
In contrast to their jubilance.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Lugubrias, lethargic, laconic.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
I feel like Dan Harmon, but you guys feel like Joey from Friends.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
You're like a golden doodle. You want to just fetch the rope in the front yard.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
I think you just called them stupid twice.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Adorable but stupid.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
No, but I'm convinced that, no, no, no, no, I didn't mean that.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
You're filled with a life that only a god could embody.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
I'm not going to let him like, maybe you are stupid. It doesn't matter.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Maybe stupid is what you're supposed to be.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Maybe being smart isn't a good idea. What does being smart mean?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Knowing more about how we're going to die.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Isn't that what we've all found out as we've gotten smarter?

02:01.000 --> 02:08.000
Don't we just figure out more and more about how we're dying?

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Didn't dumb people at the beginning of human civilization,

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
when the life expectancy was 25, didn't everybody think they were going to live forever?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Isn't that why they did so much dumb shit?

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
Because they thought that gods walked among them and they thought it was okay to abuse each other and themselves.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
Because they thought that even though they only lived to 30 before they got eaten by a saber-toothed tiger,

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
that they were destined for greater things and that they never really died.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
And didn't we slowly uncover the fact that we were actually only going to live for a certain amount of time

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
and then evaporate into the cosmos?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
And didn't we uncover those stones?

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Didn't we figure out ways to keep us alive a little bit longer, ironically?

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Like, oh, also if you take vitamin C, you won't get scurvy.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
So we slowly extended the lifespan of an intelligent species to around 80.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
And we spend those 80 years knowing that life means nothing.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Oh, shit.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
We evolved from a species of puppy dogs, you know?

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
We used to just be these weird toga-wearing, like, murderers.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Just run around in the dirt alleys just going like,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Ah, Zeus says I can stick a dick in this tree.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Just a bunch of toga-wearing Matt LeBlancs running around.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Yeah.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
That's the best character on Friends, right, Joey?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
That's the guy you want to be.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
That was the Troy, in community terms, like the kind of like, just a dog, you know?

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
He's like, he loves, he's innocent and sort of looks at things in terms of vertically.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Salt must be better than pepper or vice versa.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
There is no salt and pepper.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
That's what I always said about the Troy character.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
I said, this is a guy who you have to imagine.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
Like, don't judge any of these characters, but the character of Troy knows that there's 26 letters in the alphabet

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
and he knows which letter is more awesome than which.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
He doesn't look at it like, like just a line.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
He has, and it's not A through Z.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
It's like, it's all jumbled up.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
Like, he thinks that C is more awesome because it's like shaped like in a more awesome way.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
But D's above it.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Anyways, what am I talking about?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Sorry, your energy, your energy.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Let me reward your energy.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
What do I got to do?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I'll tell you what you shouldn't do.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
You shouldn't do what you did in the green room.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
I came into the green room, ladies and gentlemen, moments ago,

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
and could smell Dan's shit from outside the green room though.

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
And I came in there and it was, it was heavy.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
I made a boo boo.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
And you weren't there.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
I came in, Dan wasn't there, and I assumed Dan got here,

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
took a shit, and then quit Harmontown.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
Because if I had taken the shit that he took, I would have quit Harmontown.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
And so would you have.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
Like, while I was doing it, I actually looked up and looked around for vents and stuff.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Have you ever done that?

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
That's like, you have to be 40 or above to like,

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
while you're taking a crap, like, actually start inspecting the infrastructure.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
I bet, I bet this is going to be a problem.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
I think I'm pooping in a, in someone's garage.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
I think I'm going to ruin the party.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah, it's bad back there.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
The green room is not green.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Do you feel better now? You all right?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I feel great.

05:38.000 --> 05:46.000
I feel emotionally bereft and, yeah, but gastrointestinally clear.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
Anyways, let's keep, don't do that.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I'm a bad person. I took stinky shits.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Nobody here has ever taken a stinky shit and bummed anybody out, right?

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
No, you're all angels. You're all wonderful millennial angels.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
You believe in civic service. You vote for politicians.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
You believe in causes. You have Facebook causes.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
You're going to make everything great with your comments and your comment sections.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
You're not Generation X. You're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
You're wonderful people. You don't understand why Instagram would have ads.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Shame on them.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
You made Instagram with your Instagrams.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Where are these ads going to come from?

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
I'm not going to Instagram anymore. I'm a millennial.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
I hate the millennials, Jeff.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I don't even know if they're millennials or not.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I hate whoever's younger than them.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
I'm a little embarrassed to even admit that I don't know what a millennial is.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I guess it's just whatever is after it.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Baby boomer, Generation X, millennial. That's what it is.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
Above the baby boomers, it's Graham and Grandpa, the Guadalcanal, the greatest generation.

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
The people that actually did shit and are now dead because they did shit.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
And if they're left alive, they're going like, so the Japanese are good now?

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
And I'm supposed to care why? And we're like, Grandpa.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Rob Reiner was like, ma-ha, and those are baby boomers.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
Rob Reiner on All in the Family, Sally Struthers, those are the baby boomers.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Now Generation X is 40, me.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
I'm one of the younger Generation Xers, you two.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
We're actually the Generation X, depending on who you ask, Douglas Copeland, whoever.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
That Generation, you don't pinpoint this stuff.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
It's not like everyone gets together like an Ender's Game and has some brood.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
But you go by these sort of sine waves, and I don't want to buy into this shit anymore than anyone else.

07:45.000 --> 07:53.000
However, I do feel like when I listen to today's 13-year-old talk, I do hear my mom.

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
And I do think that these star children, these fucking new babies that are coming up,

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
I do think they're full of shit.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
I think that they love, like, unity.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
I think they love, they don't have that.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
I feel like baby boomers were sort of typified by, oh, we landed on the moon, we wood stocked,

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
we stock hopped, we Billy Joel'd, we did everything.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Hey, Billy Joel'd!

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
Dan, don't include Billy Joel with wood stock in the space program.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
Alright, you're right. He did not start the fire.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
I listened to that song today, it was like, you had to be a big shot.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Remember that song where it was like, we didn't start the fire?

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
There's a part where it's like, children of thalidomide.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
It's just funny to me that there's a song where you follow the phrase children of thalidomide

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
with like a hot sizzling guitar riff.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Thalidomide, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

08:57.000 --> 09:04.000
Anyways, where was I? Baby boomers with the thing, and we're the David Cross generation.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
We keep our flannel tight, we keep our hands in our pockets, we don't look.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
We were like, fuck you, fuck everything, fuck, fuck, fuck everything that has a gimmick, fuck it all.

09:14.000 --> 09:21.000
That's not culture either, but we had one thing, we perfected one thing, integrity.

09:21.000 --> 09:31.000
How dare you scoff at that? I heard a full blown like, yeah, that was Adam Goldberg.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
A full blown rap. No, fuck you, yeah, integrity.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
Are you talking about Mr. Integrity, Adam Goldberg?

09:39.000 --> 09:49.000
Like, the idea, like, that's all you have going for you if you sit in the corner of the room and go like, fuck this, fuck that, fuck it.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
You may be part of the problem, you may not be a hero ever in your life,

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
but at least you know, you know who you are and you know what you ain't doing

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
and you're not playing into any, like, larger hand.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
And I think that because now those people are having children and are kind of going,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I don't know, what do you want to do?

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
Like, these 13 year olds have these, like, little textures in their hands

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
and they're kind of like, they're so excited about this idea that we can all be one

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
and we can all unite and we can all recycle and we can all refreeze the polar ice caps

10:21.000 --> 10:27.000
but the general, like, result is that they're just intolerable fucking cocks.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Wait, 13 year olds?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
First, I want to be the Ben Franklin of hating 13 year olds.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
I'm telling you, we've got six years left to kick their asses.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
They're going to be driving soon.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
What was the last encounter you had with a 13 year old?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Yeah, Dino's kid.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I don't know.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
It's only what I read online.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I don't know.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
It's comment sections, mainly.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
I just assume all those people are 12.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
I assume everyone online is 12, but they're all 40, just like us.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
But what about Sexy 12?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
42.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Okay, fine, you caught me.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
I don't know anything I'm talking about.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
That's a millennial way of thinking, right there.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I used to play...

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
In Generation X, you used to be able to just say shit and get away with it.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
Just shit in an American flag and throw it out the window.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
You're saying that Generation X had integrity?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Yeah, that's right.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
We didn't do anything.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
That's right, that's why we had integrity.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
As you said, and I...

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Here's some things we didn't do. Watergate!

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
We didn't do that.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
We wouldn't do it.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
We did allow our country to go to war several times,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
and we kept our flannel tight and our hands in our pockets.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Yeah, but we said it was lame.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
A really flaccid and effectual generation, I would say.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Yeah, yeah.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
Also, let's put a fine point on it.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
The 90s, would that be Generation X's music, maybe?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Yeah.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
The worst music.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
But it had integrity.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Right now, right now.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
No, it didn't, because right now, if you turn on satellite Sirius XM radio,

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
and you turn on the 90s station, a shitty song is playing.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
And that is a fucking guarantee.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
Jeff, would a shitty generation have the self-awareness

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
and self-effacement to have a pocket full of its own kryptonite?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
That's something that millennials won't do.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
All they want to do is bring sexy back.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
And bringing sexy back, I got a pocket full of kryptonite!

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
It's deep!

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
And when I don't want to talk about something, we don't talk about it,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
because I'm Generation X,

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
and you millennials can go fuck yourselves,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
because you're 13 and you're 25,

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
and I don't know what I'm talking about,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
but I don't have to,

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
because I'm 40.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
Dan, I think what you're trying to say is that you want them to get off your lawn.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Yeah.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Yeah.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
You work hard in that lawn every weekend.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah, that's right.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
You're not there with your lawn mower and your mulch?

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Yeah, I earned it.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Your lawn has integrity.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Yeah.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
And these millennials are stomping all over it.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
They're stomping all my lawn with their comments section.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
And they're frisbees, and they're hula hoops, and they're whatnot.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Who cares if Instagram's going to have ads?

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
What did you ever do for Instagram, you fucks?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Wait, Dan!

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
I was disgusted, America.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I was disgusted.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Instagram said, we're going to have ads now.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
I was disgusted by your response, you guys.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
It sounds like you're the one disgusted by ads on Instagram.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
No, I'm not.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Look, I'm just doing Instagram because I want people to look at my dog.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
My dog's sometimes cute when he's sleeping.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
Instagram's where I know that 12,000 people will look at it.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
I don't care if it says Nike above it or it doesn't.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
If it does, tough titties for me.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
I guess it's hard to run Instagram.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
I'm Generation X.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I know what's up.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
It's hard to make an Instagram.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
You guys were born into it.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
It was Insta for you.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
It's already lame to say you're 40 and Gen X.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
That's already lame.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
Hey, baby boomers came up with that name.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Did they?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
We just didn't reinvent it.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
We called Generation Y, Generation Y.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
Generation Y, like baby boomers, went, I prefer millennials.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Is that true?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Sure, yes.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
I don't know what's true.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Generation X is called Generation X

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
because the baby boomers said, you're like Generation X.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
And we went, I don't care.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
And then the next generation came along and they went, name me.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
And we went, I don't know, why?

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
And they were like, no, no, star babies.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
And we went on a Trivial Pursuit Edition.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Because we have an identity.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
What would the trivia categories be on the pie of Generation Y?

15:29.000 --> 15:39.000
Conscientiousness, words that hurt,

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
fairies, different fairies.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Probably something about vampires and werewolves.

15:47.000 --> 15:53.000
Bloodthirsty monsters that don't have fangs anymore.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
All right, what are we moving on to?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I don't know.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
You really are a grumpy old man.

16:02.000 --> 16:09.000
You took a huge shit and you came at her and you're now here.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I think we do have a special guest.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
I don't want to put her on the spot, but Erin made a new friend tonight.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
She was at Kamikaze, which is Stan Lee's convention.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
She did a panel with some ladies.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
I don't know what the panel was called, ladies of powerful ladies.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
I don't know, sexy ladies, I have no idea.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
My girlfriend was on it.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
But she made friends with a pioneer of what is now a comedic institution,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
which is kind of an interesting thing.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
You don't know if she's here?

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
If I just awkwardly say...

16:40.000 --> 16:46.000
Hillary Clinton, everybody, please bring her up.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Did Lorraine Newman make it tonight?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
No.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Okay.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Wow.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
Who is that guy that's such an expert at her not making it?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
This is like a big Mr. Clean guy.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
No.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I would know.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
That's Chevy Chase back there.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
I was hoping to talk to her a little bit about our mutual.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Yeah, we both worked with him.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Wait, so Lorraine Newman was going to be here?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Yeah, she made friends with Erin.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
She's a delightful lady.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
And then she came to the green room.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
She smelled that giant...

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Yeah, we made best friends there.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
She smelled your giant shit and she fucking phoned out.

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
I probably fucking smoked her out with my big gross fucking McDonald's poop.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Lorraine Newman, if you're out there, thank you for not coming.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
You would have only smelled my poop.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
I would love to meet Lorraine Newman.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Yeah, no, it'd be interesting to talk to her just a little bit.

17:40.000 --> 17:46.000
I don't know how sick she is of talking about SNL, but she was there in 1975

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
at the beginning of what is now the exon of comedy.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
But when it wasn't the exon of comedy, when it was a variety show,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
it was just a variety show.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
It was live.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
It wasn't meant to be archived and, you know,

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
oh, this is Coneheads number three.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
This is Coneheads number four.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
It was the first NBC show to fire its creator and bring him back.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
Yes, yes, yes.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Back when that was cool.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
Yeah, back when that resulted in success.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
That was the first time.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
But in lieu of that, I don't know, man,

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
this is a Tupperware container in the back of the fridge

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
that has got a lot of different colors

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
that I can see through the translucent body.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Jeff, I don't go on Reddit anymore,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
and I don't go on...

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
Well, hold your applause,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
because this is a segment of the show

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
called Because I Don't Go On Reddit Anymore,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
What the Fuck Is Going On On Reddit?

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Because I get tweeted things.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I got tweeted, Jeff.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Do you know what a subreddit is?

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Look, I've gone on Reddit twice,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
and I don't understand what the ups and the downs

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
and there's a little picture of a Martian,

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
and I don't know what's going on.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
It's millennial shit.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Yeah.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
They think that's changing the world.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Wait, so you're going on...

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
It's not a regular forum,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
because depending on whether people like what you wrote or not,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
it moves up and down.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
So if I look at it one day and then go back the next day,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
it's all in a different order based on its own popularity?

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Yeah.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Gay.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Downvote.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Alright, so...

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
And I mean gay in a Gen X,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
I don't care if gay is bad gay.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Not your millennial,

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
oh, come on, man, bullying shit, man.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Integrity.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
That's not integrity, it's just coping a...

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Wait, I'm sorry.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I don't even know what you're talking about.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
No, we're not good people, but we think...

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
No, I'm not saying we're not good people.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
That's so retarded.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
That's not integrity, that's just...

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Integrity doesn't mean good person.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Integrity means...

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
No, it does, that's exactly what it means.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Integral.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Integral.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
To what?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
To what?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
To oneself.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Self-contained.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Self-contained.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Integrity.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
I know who I am.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
So we're self-contained assholes.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Yeah, sure.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Alright, so you're not...

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
You know what, some of us are self-contained good people.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
Kurt Cobain.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
He seemed alright.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
On the inside?

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Seemed, yeah.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I don't know, he seemed like a good guy to me.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
He seemed like he had integrity.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
How many of today's artists have the balls

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
to blow their brains out?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Because they're popular.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Or how many artists today have the balls

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
to marry somebody who hires somebody

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
to blow their brains out?

20:42.000 --> 20:49.000
No.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
She had him killed, come on.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
She fucking had that dude killed.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
It's not ours to say.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
It's mine to say.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
Because you have integrity.

21:00.000 --> 21:06.000
That's my point.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
Cherry snacks, baby.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
We're not going to go down as the coolest generation

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
when...

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
We're not even going to make the top ten

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
in this century.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Oh, that's true.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
But we did open the roads

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
to trade agreements with China

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
in our own way.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
When you say we, you mean you and me?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Yeah.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Well, you and me and Doug Benson.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
No, baby boomers did that on our watch.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Well, they loosened the mayonnaise jar.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
But Generation X really,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
really drove it home with China.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Wait, we are the reason why

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Iron Man 3

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
had a special segment in it where

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Iron Man lands in China and says,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I love China.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
That was our doing.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
How was this generation?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Does Gen X like China?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
We have now come to terms with the fact

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
that we have to like them.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
To the point where we re-edited Red Dawn

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
and airbrushed out all the Chinese flags

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
into North Korean flags.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Yeah.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Generation X is the generation

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
that has now come to terms with China.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Come to terms with it.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
The way Newton came to terms with gravity.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
This exists.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
China exists.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
We are the Marco Polo of...

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Integrity.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
People in a world where China's

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
already been discovered.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
What were we talking about?

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
A new segment called...

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
What's on that?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Okay, all right.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
So, subreddit.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
There's a Harmontown subreddit.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
All right.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
So, remember our friend Levi?

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Yes, I do.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
With the shoes?

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Are you kind of cross-dressing?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
So, he tweeted me.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
He's on band now.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Well, Adam,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
you're coming up.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Adam has to come up and talk about this.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Adam is a moderator of the subreddit.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Levi was banned.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Wait, wait. Who elected Adam

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
moderator of the subreddit?

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Adam created the subreddit.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Does that works?

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Okay.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Adam, would you like...

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
You don't have to come up,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
but I'm inviting you up to...

23:25.000 --> 23:35.000
the subreddit maintenance.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
This is a fact-finding mission.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
How is adding scenes

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
to Iron Man 3 Integrity?

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
I was obviously being

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
ironic.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
You guys are really good at irony.

23:47.000 --> 23:55.000
That's why we invented Iron Man.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Wow.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
All right.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
We invented loving him.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Okay.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
After Baywatch,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
there was a wonderful series called

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Baywatch Nights,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
that everybody watched and it went more than six episodes.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
And after Harmontown,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
there was Harmontown.com

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
in the subreddit section

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
to discuss Harmontown.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
So I created it.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Someone annoyed me.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
I gave them a week off.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
They're back now.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
And I learned the depth

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
to which I am disliked.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
I interrupt.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
When you say you gave someone a week off,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
that sounds like you sent somebody to Tahiti.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
On an all-expense paid vacation.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Any other website,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
but our Harmontown is Tahiti.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
What?

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
You sent someone to the cornfield

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
like the kid in Twilight Zone?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
That's a good episode.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
You banned him from it?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Yeah.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I'm going to start.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
It takes one to no one.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Neither do I know, nor do I care.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I don't know what's going on.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I just want to know.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I appreciate.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I'm cognizant of the fact that

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
dragging you up here

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
is...

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
You're up at the plate

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
with two strikes against you, blah, blah, blah.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
But I really do.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
I am actually curious.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
I also think there's some inherent entertainment value.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
At that point, I believed

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
the first two parts. I did not believe that part.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
You don't think that I thought

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
it would be entertaining to talk about it?

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I accept that I would be wrong.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
This is like a DVD commentary

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
about a DVD commentary.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
But I wanted to talk to you.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
What I was really thinking about

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
when I was talking about that

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
was how that...

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
I've been in the Harmontown subreddit

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
and I've seen, as in all of Reddit,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
you see the brackets and it says deleted.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
What does that mean? What happens?

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Sometimes it's user deleted.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Sometimes it's automatically deleted.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Sometimes people delete their own.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
If you say something like Tahiti being

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
something-something, you can be like,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I didn't say that at all.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
But if someone responds to you and says,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
you're full of shit and here's why,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
you can go back and delete your comment

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
and just leave that person hanging there

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
going like,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
you're full of shit, Mr.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
deleted in brackets.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Which is why you have to quote extensively.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
You have to say,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
well, you said this, this and this,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
but actually the capital is Mogadishu,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
so I think you've been

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
welcome to the own zone.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Hashtag own zone.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
So our friend Levi...

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Didn't use that

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
term.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Our friend Levi is

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
in the Harmontown subreddit

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
where let's all

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
admit that

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
nobody's

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
tomorrow's senators are not

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
running through the Harmontown subreddit.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
It is hopefully

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
a place for misfits.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
It's like a field of dreams of glory holes,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
but there's some animals mixed in there.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Right.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Okay,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
now I'm back in.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
It is a place

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
where normal interactions

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
are theoretically possible,

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
but the medium makes them

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
squealier

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
than nearly anything else.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Your internet is a toilet

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
theory. Yes, it is.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
And it's horrendous and I'm speaking to you

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
as a guy who won't even go

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
back there because I realize

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
that even the act of being there

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
can cause harm to people.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
So I'm not attacking you,

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
but I'm definitely curious and think it's an important conversation.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
As we talk about going

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
to form a colony on the moon,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
and you are in this situation,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
appointed or not, where you created the subreddit,

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
which I thought was a... I mean...

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
It's a good discussion venue.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
So it put you in the place of a moderator

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
and now you're in the position, you've got this band button

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
and you clicked on it for this guy

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
who's been on our show with his no shoes

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
and his crazy talk.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
I think his thing was he was barefoot

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
and wanted to be pregnant.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
So what did he do

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
in the subreddit

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
that made the difference

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
between clicking ban

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
and just letting him go?

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I think it was like the 87th post

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
of why did you ban me

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
that retroactively justified everything,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
but if you look at

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
someone's comments on Reddit, it tells you

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
how many times you've downvoted them

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
or how many times you're like,

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
ah, I don't want to read this ever again.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
So his crime was being the Dan Harmon

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
of the Harmontown subreddit?

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
He was being the Adam Goldberg

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
of the Harmontown subreddit.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
But the Adam Goldberg of the Harmontown subreddit

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
banned him, which is why this is so fascinating.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
It isn't.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
At some level, that arbitrary power

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
has the ability to be arbitrary.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
But why did you ban him?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
It was getting to the point

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
where every single comment

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
was him responding to someone,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
and I'm going to take this at personal level.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Back in January,

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
at the show at the Egyptian

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
when I rushed on stage and embarrassed myself,

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
that was because

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
I was thinking about Harmontown almost all the time.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
What am I going to say at Harmontown?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
What should I do for Harmontown? What should I wear for Harmontown?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
That wasn't a very healthy place to be.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
And when you see someone

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
who's all their internet posts are,

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
this relates to Harmontown. This is how I feel about Harmontown.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Is that how you feel about Harmontown?

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
You realize that in someone else

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
is something that's been plaguing you.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
And so giving them,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
it's arbitrary, it's a sign of power,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
and I regret doing it because

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
the entire community's consensus was I shouldn't have done it.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Okay, so this is confessional for you, right?

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
This is the trap you fell into.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
You felt like

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
a nerd and an underdog

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
and you felt like you had

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
done things that you shouldn't have done

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
and then you saw someone else doing them

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
and you were like, yeah,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
and that's what we all do.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
I didn't go about it very eloquently.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Internet is not a venue for eloquence.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
It doesn't have a lot of eye contact.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
It doesn't have pitch.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I have a very high standard for word choice on the internet.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Absolutely.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I demand 100%

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
being sarcastic.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Otherwise, deleted by deleted, we'll get up in there.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
But

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
the fact that we can

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
create communities about communities

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
by someone who created community

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
shows

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
your theory that millennials

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
are a really abstracted

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
pictures of pictures of pictures

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
of frames generation because

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
everything is iterated.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Everything has a comment section.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Everything is a direct response.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
A way to yell at Clint Eastwood,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
hey, at Clint Eastwood, you are

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
tag-worked, lols, hashtag

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
lols.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
The person who reads that can click

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
every other instance of someone misspelling

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
laughs out loud.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
And that's our culture.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
And it may not be Kurt Loder on MTV News,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
but it's...

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
LAUGHTER

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
APPLAUSE

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
A chill shot from...

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
It's everyone thinking they're Daria.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
It's every single Daria in the high school library

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
writing to every other Daria.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
And that's really interesting because nobody

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
would be more into that than Gen Xers.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
That's how we approach it.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
We're like, oh, shit, everyone's a Daria,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
but fuck these Darias using this thing.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
That's interesting.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Because we thought Kurt Loder was

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
as good as it got.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
No, we didn't.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Yes, we did, Jeff!

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Stop, don't be a fucking cell out.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
No, Dan, stop tying me to fucking Kurt Loder.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Jeff, you loved him.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Please welcome to the stage Kurt Loder.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
I'm here.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I don't...

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
LAUGHTER

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Kurt Loder.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
What does that guy do wrong?

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
He did nothing wrong, but he didn't

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
speak for us.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
I wasn't saying he was the Walter Cronkite

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
of our generation.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
That was the implication.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
What Adam was saying, what I'm extrapolating

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
from that, is that

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
a huge technological

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
threshold that we crossed between these

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
generations, depending on where you draw the line,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
is that we went from passive

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
one-way transmission into

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
interactive.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
We have a generation that's grown up on the internet.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
That means that they get to say

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
something back.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
It doesn't fucking matter to Rupert Murdoch

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
what they have to say,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
but we have to all deal with each other

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
in this swirly, eyes-wide shut toilet

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
of everyone saying back

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
to each other.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
And Gen Xers are coming from a place of like,

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
a big day.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
You did what you had to do,

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
and you put yourself out there.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
If somebody had something to say back,

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
it got back to you

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
through less channels,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
thinner, fiber-optic lines.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
And now we're all swimming around

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
in this turd pit.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
It used to take real effort to threaten a celebrity.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
You need to find out their address.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
You need to get to the post office, get a stamp.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
And now it's just a few

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
clicks on your phone.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
That has a deeper effect

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
than just being allowing us to yell at each other

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
a little louder.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
My big concern is the

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
psychological or philosophical,

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
maybe you would call it,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
the impact of people feeling like

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
it's revolutionary

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
to use

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
that medium

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
to police each other

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
when

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
in my day, Kurt Loder

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
told kids what to dance to.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
And there was a president above him

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
who went to war with all the countries

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
and launched the Tom Hawk missiles.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Nobody ever questioned the politician.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
You're exactly right.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
That's not how MTV worked, because it had nothing to do

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
with what the president did above him.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
But Kurt Loder told the kids

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
what to think and what to feel,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
and the kids told Kurt Loder whether or not

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
he was full of shit, and you reacted to Kurt Loder

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
by getting your haircut different from Kurt Loder

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
or getting your haircut the same as Kurt Loder,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
and nothing ever affected the fucking president.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Flash forward to today where you have a president,

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
and instead of Kurt Loder,

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
you have 8 million fucking YouTube channels.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
You have a bunch of people swirling around each other.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
What you don't have is anybody

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
asking what the fuck the president is doing.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
That's why it's a little infuriating to me

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
that the toilet underneath

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
what used to be Kurt Loder is now

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
consumed with policing each other.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
It's like they've tricked us into

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
like self-hatred, which is a common thing

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
that happens all the time.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
We're like, are you racist?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Are you sexist? Are you...

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
We're gonna do this dance forever?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Really? Like, like, like, like...

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Yeah, everyone wants to squeebsquab everyone else.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Yeah. But I'd like to...

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
I'm alarmed about it because

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
they...

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
they turned the key on the internet.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
They're like, here we go everybody,

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
here's the internet, and the government

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
must have been like, holy shit, what the fuck

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
are they gonna do?

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
And they crossed their fingers

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
and closed their eyes, and then they slowly

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
and all they heard was got milk ads.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
What's up? What's up?

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
It's a super friend's doing what's up.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
But between Kurt Loder and the internet

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
there was a show called TRL.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Total Request, one woo for TRL,

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
which is accurate.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Total Request Live was the bridge between

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
mass culture and prescribed culture.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Yes, because you could totally request. Live.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
People would go to New York and make part of their visits

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
standing outside MTV Studios

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
saying, I need to hear bye-bye-bye.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
I need to hear bye-bye-bye.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Technology which had never existed on Good Morning America.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Yeah.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Well, but now there's nothing like that

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
because you can watch music videos whenever you want.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
You don't have to hear a snippet

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
of 98 degrees' new hit.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
And you don't have music video

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
television telling you

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
whether or not this is a hot record

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
or something that's going to be into the pit.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
But that affects consumption. It doesn't affect

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
how we react to the people who live behind these marble walls.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
No, it's not a wealth

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
poverty dynamic. It's a person

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
to listener dynamic.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Isn't that crazy? Isn't that weird?

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Isn't that weird?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
The ability for all of us to talk to each other

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
all of a sudden has absolutely no impact

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
above a certain level.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
It didn't. Do you think the patricians in ancient Rome

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
were like, oh, that guy,

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
these scribblings, these rude

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
frescoes are really...

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
I think that in ancient Rome when somebody

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
announced that there was a new way

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
to measure a rectangle, sometimes

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
that dude got his fucking arms and legs cut off.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Oh, yeah, bad example.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Because it threatened the way we thought about government.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
There was a lot of murder because of people's ideas

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
in ancient Rome.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
I think that the guy that decided the sun

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
was at the center of the solar system,

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
a seemingly benign idea,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
was forced to repent.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
A benign idea that wasn't in the Bible.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Correct.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Because now that we've defeated

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
the Christians,

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
now we have no more power structures

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
to overcome, right?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
We don't have a religion in this world

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
that's telling us what to think about.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
If you go look at Tehran or something,

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
that religion as a powerful societal influence

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
can be extremely

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
restrictive in what people say,

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
but also how they think.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
They found that in some Saharan-African

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
cultures that if there's no past tense

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
there is no words

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
that follow concepts like promise.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
There's no word in Swahili for promise.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Because it requires

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
the past tense of I said I was going

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
to do something now.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
I'm not under that obligation.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Words are directly power

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
and when you give words like the Bible,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
like the Torah, like the Koran,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
the power to be absolutely true

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
and free of the strictures of science

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
and free of the questioning of the man on the street,

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
those words gain eternal power.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Now we don't have that.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
The internet, it was even there at all.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
One of the first websites I visited

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
was called Skeptics Annotated Bible.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
That was when I was a little shit.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
It was 2003. I would sneak off

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
from Swim at a summer camp

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
and look up all these passages of the Bible

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
and then like little pictures on the side.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
It's like, how can that be true?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
That's mathematically false.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
What did it say in Genesis 1?

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
And just the ability to

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
transmit ideas

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
instantly against the strictures of religion

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
has like a Martin Luther

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
effect on changing our culture.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
A Gutenberg effect.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
We beat the Bible a million years ago.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
You can look at the skyline

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
of a city and see

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
the buildings that have to do with money.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Sonic the T-shirt, jacket,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
and a Power Ranger shirt.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
The power combo has now reached a stage.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
How you been?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
You can applaud for Hazy. How you been?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Building rocket ships?

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Hazy just joined us.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Thinking about today has come up on stage.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
I was just thinking about you the other day.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
We squandered our Armenian

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
who was actually building spaceships.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Well, I was just helping people

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
build them.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
You're doing more than Adam

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
in terms of spaceflight.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Once we get to the moon

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
we may need Adam to tell us...

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
What compelled you to come up to the stage?

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
The idea that we beat religion

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
and it's just like a big no.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
No, no, no.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
All I've done is read.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
I'm not going out there.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I'm not actually

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
talking to people.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
It's just things I've read.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
If you go to any kind of area

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
outside of a city

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
things can be hundreds

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
or at least 60 or 50 years

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
behind what we think

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
we've already beaten.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Absolutely.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
When we talk about, oh, that's just rural area.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Well, that's most of the country.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Most of the world places

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
where children can't go to school because of their gender

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
we haven't beaten religion.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
In Los Angeles we have.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
In Los Angeles you could be gay 80 years ago

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
and it wasn't a huge deal.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
But in most of the country that is tantamount to saying

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
the devil has control of your senses,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
motivations and instincts.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
You are a flaw.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Absolutely conceded, you guys.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
However, as a sort of like

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
the people that are making things

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
the people that have constructed

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
the glass in your eyeglasses

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
the people that are, like

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
as a society, the people that have built

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
the skyscrapers that are taller

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
than the churches on the skyline,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
the people that are printing the newspapers,

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
the people that are kind of like, you know,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
secular.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
The people that are in the silent majority.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
It's strong language to say

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
we won, we beat them

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
because that implies there's no more fight

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
to be fought.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
What I mean when I say that is

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
we

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
have to get our shit together.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
We are empowered now.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
We know

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
that logic

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
is important.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I really agree. I think

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
that, and this is something very strongly

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
I guess I'd like to broadcast

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
out to the world, I think everyone needs to

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
pick the path of least resistance.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
You don't argue with people, arguing

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
never convinces someone of anything.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
We just convinced him of something.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Well, he's open.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
No, that's not true. If you guys had told me

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
that I was wrong about something, I would have

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
batted it off because I'm a primate.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
You changed me by

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
saying how you felt about something

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
and I was invited to

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
make sure that you knew that I was also in that

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
water. That's important to know.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
And yet you're open, you're one of the most open

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
people, you're open to people coming up

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
and I just walked up, I had no right to do it

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
and you're fine with that, ish.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
You know,

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
don't do it, you guys.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
But

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
it's fact

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
that

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
I've been

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
trolling ish, the Fox News comment

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
section, and just being like

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Obama's trying to give me gay healthcare,

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
just trying to take it to the

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
extreme, the extreme

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
level to see when they go back

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
and other Republicans will be like, I don't think

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
he's trying to do that, that hasn't happened yet.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
They just kind of agree.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
There's so little

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
resistance to just going into the

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
New York Times Facebook comment section,

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
no matter what the story is, and just saying, God is real.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
And someone will pick a fight with you,

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
someone will pick a fight with you, and then

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
when they do you say, that's a good point, but you

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
forgot that God is real.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
But I can't

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
even remember what

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
it's like this, this is this rabbit hole

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
that we go down. I mean, if you guys want to

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
get in a knife fight with

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
people that are,

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
you know,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
they sort of like have constructed

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
their world view around

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
something that absolutely needs to be

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
argued with.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
But there's a mindset where

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
like, you know, I know

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
atheists that are

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
so immature about their atheism

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
that I sometimes encourage

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
them to just be Christian.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Like, you're so,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
you're such a fucking zealot

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
about how God

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
doesn't exist. Like, I feel like

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
you're protesting too much, and like, I

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
didn't walk into this bar

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
feeling like God didn't exist so

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
much that I needed to get into a knife fight

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
about it. Whereas you do, so

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
maybe you need to go back to the

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
thing. And I also know atheists

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
that are the most compassionate,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
wonderful, like, that's why

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
they're technically, the word atheist

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
almost is. Sorry to cut you off.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Go ahead. I don't

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
think, people think when you become an

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
atheist or a Christian, that's like an achievement, but

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
no, I feel like an asshole will be an asshole

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
in any culture. They're just going to grow

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
up and be like, oh, this

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
is the way I get to be an asshole and tell

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
people what to do. And in some cultures

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
it's easier to be this way or that way.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
It doesn't matter.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
We need to stop thinking of the

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
spectrum between atheism and Christianity.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
It's just, you're a cool dude

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
and you're not a cool dude.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
And so when we talk about

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
subreddits and we talk about

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
AV club, we talk about defamera, we talk about

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
we're living this post internet world, the

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
internet was created by

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
these programmers.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
It was created by the military to

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
communicate ideas really quickly. Yes.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
The military was like, what if you made

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
computers together?

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
It's not helping us kill people. Give it to the

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
libraries.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
But I'm talking

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
about the code

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
that was built.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
What is it? 40 years old now?

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
What is Unix?

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
There's the code that we've built our entire

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
virtual

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
structure on.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I'm pretty sure that those guys

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
didn't go home at night and rubbed rosary beads

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
and stuff. I think those guys are

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
maybe some of them were Christian.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Stephen Colbert is a fucking Christian.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
But

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I also think they're logicians.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
They have to be.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
They are pragmatic people.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Dan, can we get back to

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
the thing I started this all was you saying

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
that you are now not on subreddit, you're not on

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
the internet anymore? Well that's because

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
I'm hurting people every time I get on the internet.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
So no Twitter, no Facebook? Twitter is fine.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Twitter seems to be doing fine.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
So I put

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
pictures of my dog on Instagram and I'm on

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Twitter and then on Tumblr

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
and people can

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
send me messages and

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
these kids send me messages

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
and sometimes they say

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
I'm gay and I want to kill myself and I can

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
write them back privately if they wrote privately

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
and go don't do that. Keep being gay.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
It sounds like you missed out on everyone

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
after that episode where you felt that

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
you were hurting someone. Everyone's like no I want Dan Harmon

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
to keep talking. Yeah it was like 98%

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Dan Rose.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Well there's a polarizing effect of that

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
stuff. You know what you have to do

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
in those moments? You have to shoot straight through

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
the middle and I don't want to

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
get warped by that idea.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
I just felt like, I don't know, you follow your

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
bliss. My bliss is not

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
hanging out on there. I'm not doing it passive

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
aggressively. How was anybody's bliss

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
living in a fucking comment

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
section? I can't understand it. Exactly

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
I mean I was born in 1973

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
I'm an old, funny daddy. Get off my lawn

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
you whippersnappers. But fucking

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
comment sections is just a bunch of fucking

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
anger, a bunch of misguided

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
spleen for no reason. Well I

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
think it would be sarcastic like me in trying to

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
get a reaction. I will answer that question Jeff.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Adam you at Mad with Power

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
you were in control of something and the first time

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
somebody reminded you of

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
yourself you

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
snuffed them out like a cigarette. It's an

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
ugly, ugly world.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
And the reason I looked at Reddit

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
I went down a thing and some things

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
people say very sweet things. Sometimes people say

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
I don't like it. Here's wine. It's very

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
succinct and very well worded and lovely

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
but mostly it's just a bunch of spiraling

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
nonsense and I'm not trying to

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
stop what's going on here

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
but watching four men talk about religion

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
and politics is like the fucking

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
like it's all guys do. Guys get together

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
we have a couple drinks and we try to

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
not like girls.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
We haven't even talked about Jesus's shoes

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
which are fantastic but I did mention

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
you sure. Adam I was talking. Shut the fuck

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
up.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
No women talk about interpersonal things

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
and guys try to solve the world's problems

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
and we get together and we just spiral around

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
and do all this stuff and the internet to me

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
is just this weird spiraling morass

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
of inanity and I look at it

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
and it's just like if I

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
want to just complain I'll type some shit

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
and it's watching people just bicker and I hate

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
bickering.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
It sounds like you hate waste.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Waste of time, waste of energy

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
waste of the

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
English language. I hate

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
the

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
abbreviation of our language

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
into clicks and grunts which

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
H.L. Menken in the 20s or 30s

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
predicted before typewriters

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
and computers and before. I mean not before

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
typewriters but before people

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
wrote through typing.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
He predicted that our language would be reduced

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
to a series of short grunts and clicks

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
and abbreviations

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
and anagrams or

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
what's the acronyms.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
And he's absolutely right. It's like

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
watching people have discourse like that

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
it's

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
shocking, our language is dying

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
and I think there's nothing

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
to be proud of by a culture

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
that communicates through feedback

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
loops like that. I think that

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
there's no art to it, there's no

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
intelligence necessary

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
and I think there's no vetting process

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
and there's no qualifications for someone

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
to go on there and moderate

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
something to ban somebody, to go on there

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
and flame somebody, to go on and torture people

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
to go on and tell you to shut up, for you to

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
feel bad about that, for you to even care about it

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
like

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
I go to restaurants, I look at Yelp

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
because Yelp is great because it tells you where

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
if I travel a lot and I'll type in

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Italian restaurant if I'm in the mood

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
or pizza or Thai food or whatever I want

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
and you look at it and I look for the worst reviews

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
and if I see some cunt or douchebag

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
or some guy going, I went on the first day

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
to Bangkok Thai

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
and my day was pretty unhappy

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
like you had a bad time, you're an asshole

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
if I find the most bad reviews

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
I go to that restaurant because

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
you won't be there

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Yeah, well, so, but

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
listen, so you go to the drawing

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
room, you got your suit on, you play darts

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
you have the same conversation you have

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
with the regulars there, there's some

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
repetition there, there's some inefficiency there

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I'm not standing up for what you're talking about

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
but I'm saying it is human nature

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
there's introverts and extroverts

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
there's people who want to look good

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
and people who are better at making eye contact

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I'm not in that school

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
I'm graduating, I'm being forced to graduate

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
at 40 years old

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
I do not

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
want it to be happening to me

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
but I didn't want to quit smoking either

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
I have to get off the fucking internet

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
and I have to go sit in a corner

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
of a bar and drink

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Let's all get off the internet, let's all throw it in the toilet

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Another last episode everybody

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
You guys were talking about before

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
or not

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
The internet can be revolutionary

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
and the moment there is a protest

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
in Seattle against the World Bank

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
and they

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
turn off your fucking twitter, they turn off your phones

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
so people can't say let's all meet

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
and let's go protest and one person says

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
hey let's all go break some windows

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
that person goes to jail

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
and didn't commit a crime but for inciting

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
a riot

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
the Egyptian Spring

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
they made our telephones illegal

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
because it can be very powerful

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
we do have in our fingertips

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
the ability to take down

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
institutions, governments

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
all kinds of things

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
they are very happy to watch

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
just LOL at LeBron James' tweet

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
about somebody's asshole

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
that's what it all is

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
the moment it becomes effective and we do anything with it

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
it's possible to be great graffiti on walls

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
like the situation is where they would write

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
the graffiti was incredible

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
political screeds and things like that

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
that made sense and were provocative

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
the moment you provoke anything on twitter

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
they just shut off your cell towers

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
and

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
they don't want you to actually communicate

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
so what we've been limited to

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
is pretending that what we're doing

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
when we're typing these things in

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
and thumbing things instead of talking to the people

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
and making eye contact with anybody

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
we're not communicating shit

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
we're inverting

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
like a CQCumber

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
we're not doing anything positive at all

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
I'm going to disagree, communication doesn't have to be revolution

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
and fun can be fun

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
just because we're not

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
marching on Washington or driving our trucks

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
there in some failed attempt

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
to take out people in suits and change things

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
fun is always legal

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
revolution is always illegal

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
that's the point because it's against the law

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
no one is going to outlaw checkers

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
you can play candy crush

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
but the moment you use our ability to communicate

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
with each other for anything that's provocative

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
or possibly revolutionary

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
that's when it's going to be illegal

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
absolutely

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I don't think we're revolutionizing anything

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
in person either

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
and if the feds are the only people that have phones

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
that are capable of twitterizing

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
I don't want to live in that society either

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
I missed the good old days

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
because we were the last people that were actually born

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
I think that

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
born in 1973 I remember

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
no answering machines

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
the answering machine was an invention as I was a child

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
and before then the phone just rang

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
and if you didn't pick it up you weren't home

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
and fuck you ant whoever

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
like I ain't coming

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
and I remember

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
as like being a kid my mom and dad like the phone rang

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
and we all look around and it's like ring

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
and we'd all just like have a fork up

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
my dad would have a cocktail

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
my mom would have a glass of wine

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
and we'd all just look at each other like

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
we ain't doing it

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
and the beauty of

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
solitude and then I remember

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
like I had a pager

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
after people had cell phones

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
I got a pager and I was like I'm anchored

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
to the sea floor now

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I can never ever be alone

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I can never ever be free

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
I think that's my grumpy

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
curmudgeonly grumpy old man thing

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
is like there was a time when

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
you weren't constantly tethered

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
to every fucking person

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
but we're talking about two different things

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
you're as a guy who

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
wears a suit to a bar and talks to people and hangs out

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
you are getting

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
a huge amount of usage out of the fact

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
that everyone's interconnected through the internet

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Yelp is one example that you mentioned

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
you're asking a different question

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
which is why would

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
anyone ever choose

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
to emotionally invest themselves

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
into the conversations that take place

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
on the internet as opposed to the conversations

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
that take place between you and your friends

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
at a dart board and a bar

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
the answer is because in those conversations

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
people like me

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
are rendered completely irrelevant

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
and also look at everything

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
as irrelevant

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
I don't want to talk to those people

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
I've seen those conversations

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
I don't get any joy out of them

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I don't like interpersonal small talk

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
you have an entire book just of things

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
you wrote because the internet gave you

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
a place where you could write them

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
I don't remember a goddamn word of those things

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
my girlfriend published a book of them

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
I was 40 years old walking

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
into my house and

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
I don't remember writing any of that shit

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
and if that medium hadn't existed

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
I would've

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
they'd be in a diary somewhere

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
not even no way

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
because with a diary there would've been no illusion

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
that anyone I was out there reacting to me

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
there was something strange that happened to me

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
when I discovered that thing called blogging

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
which had that dumb word

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
and all my hipster friends were going like

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
blogging blog blog blog

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
blog blog blog blog

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
and I was like you know what

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
I still hate blog

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
hate away

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
also webisode

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
fucking webisode

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
I would come home at the end of the night

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
and I would have a medium

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
in which I could type my thoughts

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
which I somehow felt

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
like

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
someone's going to read this somehow

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
it's just some weird

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
paradoxical thing

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
whatever I want because no one's ever going to read it

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
or care about it

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
but only if people could read it theoretically

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
would I ever write it?

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
why no you're not going to reread it

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
why would you scroll it on an app kit

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
what am I, seer hand seer hand

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
so Dan you're saying that now

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
you foresworn emotional reactions or connections

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
to the comment sections

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
and reddits and things

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
I'm not going to declare policy

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
because I find that

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
I followed my bliss

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
I deleted

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
my reddit client from my phone

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
and I've deleted

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
my only

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
avenues of connection

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
and believe me

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
there's nothing against reddit because

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
it's only against the secondary effects

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
that can happen because reddit actually

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
is such a beneficial medium

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
I think because of its conversational

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
tone

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
that it lends itself

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
to the Gawker Defamer kind of

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
for a guy like me

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
because of celebrity and the intersection

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
between celebrity and technology

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Jeff I'd like to say

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
you having a cell phone is wonderful for your life

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
you're an actor, you don't want to be

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
in your apartment every day hoping

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
that you hear back for a part

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
you can go out, you can live a life

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
you don't have to worry about the answering machine

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
you don't have to worry about not having an answering machine

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
as someone who gets gigs while he's driving

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
or while he's at a party

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
or at a friend's house being able to take

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
work with my pocket is tremendously

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
freeing because there are some days

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
the phone doesn't ring at all but

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
it's 7pm on a Sunday

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
I like to be able to know I'm going to work on Wednesday

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
and not have to be at home

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Adam, why are you mad at me right now?

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
he thinks that you

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
that you might possibly

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
convince everyone in a room full of people

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
to unplug the internet

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
because you have

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
flesh and blood efficacy

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
which is something that Adam and I do not have

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
and so we like to sit

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
in the corners of our dark apartments

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
or in my case mansion

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
because of what I write

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
I love that you just

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
you've committed to being a bad person

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
we get an emotional charge

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
I was going to say it's neither healthy nor unhealthy

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
but I might as well just say it's unhealthy

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
but it's

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
it can't possibly produce good effects

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
I mean none of us are living

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
in the days of Jane Austen

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
and was she nailing it?

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
are we supposed to be going to picnics

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
and doing special dances

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
among the nobles

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
to strengthen some kind of class system

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
and having

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
it's a shame that you go to a dinner

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
and your elbows are on the table

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Adam has just broken into a flask of booze here

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
I don't know what that is

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Harmontown Earth Shine

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
give more than you take is the slogan

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
of Harmontown Earth Shine

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
I don't even know what this is

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
who made this booze

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
sorry we should have whoever is responsible

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
come up and take credit for it

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
get up here

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
I'm holding a

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
I didn't know I think somebody must have

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
hello

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
what's your name sir

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
I'm holding a bottle of

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
it says

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
it's Harmontown Earth Shine

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
and the slogan is give more than you take

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
so

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
tell us about this

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
so

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I started making

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
I started home brewing about 20 years ago

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
it's moonshine

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
what kind of liquor is it

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
130 proof

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
oh I can't drive home now

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
but yeah the base liquor is actually

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Santa Monica tomorrow

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
I have to write like three episodes of community tonight

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
just that sip is going to make the third one

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
about like socks

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
it's distilled from mead

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
so I mix

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
basket honey and maple syrup

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
pass that shit down Adam

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
fermented out with

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
champagne yeast

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
and then doubled and tripled distilled

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
wow we

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
I love that

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Dan took a sip and became a lyric from George

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
George Jones white lightning

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
sounds bugged out and his face turned blue

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
yeah I had immediate

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
sensory memory of that Nashville show

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
but I

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
that's delicious

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
I love that it's earth shines

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
it carries a lot of flavor

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
from the honey

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
forward

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
when did you first start brewing alcohol

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
you could run your fucking car on that stuff

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
so it's strong

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
it's like paint thinner if a paint thinner

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
it'll take sharpie off

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
it's actually the base

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I use I keep some of it

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
pure like this but I usually actually

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
as a base for an absence that I make

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
every year

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
I can't believe it took us this many episodes

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
for people to start making us our own booze

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I love that

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
it's earth shine because we'll be living on the moon

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
that's brilliant

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
so Glenn how does somebody get into that

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
so like somebody you're into ships and bottles

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
and you're so it's funny

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
so I actually I started

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
actually making a beer homebrew

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
about 20 years ago

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
we're not breaking so many federal laws by passing this booze around

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
we didn't sell it

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
it's not being sold it's being sold

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
hey give that back

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
so I'm actually

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I'm a scientist

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I'm a scientist

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I have a phd

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
metallurgical engineering

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
and this is

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
it's a hobby

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
but it's a hobby there

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
we're all going to jail tonight I love this

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
organ related

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
something good is about to happen right now

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
it's already happening

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
9-11!

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
it makes someone

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
good is about to happen

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
why were they storing so much smoke in the World Trade Center

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Glenn, alright

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
everybody calm down

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
this is interesting

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Glenn

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Dan have more moonshine because I want that natural energy

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
you had back

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
because at one point

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
you started dipping cheese sticks into ranch

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
smaring the ranch

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
shave cream

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
you can cut it

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
put it on the rocks cut it with a little bit of water

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
it's over here

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
it's back in the house right now

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
so Glenn it's an interest that started with you

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
with making a homebrew beer

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
so you're making stuff in your garage

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
that's designed to

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
sip and get fucked up on

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
but with homebrew beer

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
you have that sort of logical

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
out of like well it's beer

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
it tastes good

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
when you branch out into moonshine

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
you're sort of like

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
you're becoming more of a Timothy Leary figure

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I'm just curious about

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
it's really

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
for me it's more about the absence

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
I also have an herb garden

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I grow all my own herbs that go into the absence

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
and then it's something that I offer to friends

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
every year

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
you're on the guest list for the rest of your life

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
you are all my friends

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
let's have a hand for Glenn

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
and let's say goodbye to Adam Goldberg

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
too

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
thank you Adam

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I mean

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I think we had an

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
that wasn't a show killer right

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
we had an interesting conversation about

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
the future of the internet

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I think it's something that

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
it's not going to get solved here

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I think we all have different reactions

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
you make a good point that you

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
you have a relationship with the internet

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
that I don't have because I'm more of

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I'm a more gregarious person

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
and when I look at people

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
having fake or what I perceive to be

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
that's not overstated

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
there's lots of stuff I've seen on forms

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
and non subreddits and stuff

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
the two times I've gone to it or whatever

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
people are having discourse

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
it is actual conversation

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
it so quickly dissolves

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
into ego

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
and me me me me me me me me me

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
kind of stuff

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
there's just so much bickering and fighting

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
that I can't dig it but

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I like to go

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
be alone in public

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I love being around people and not talking to them

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I don't need that much interaction

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I think it's awesome

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
if you said

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
you don't want to have that much of an emotion

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
you don't want to tie your ego

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
to the internet as much as you do

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
well I can't anymore

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I'm not allowed to anymore

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
you are allowed to

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I was talking to a community writer

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
tonight at the drawing room before the show

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
and he was talking about some guy

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
a professor at some college

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
he was using an example

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
a phrase he used

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
where he said

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
this guy was a critic of literature

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
and so

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
he became prominent

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
and he didn't become prominent because he was good

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
it wasn't because he was bad

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
he just became prominent

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
he was a critic of literature

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
and then he would

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
criticize Hamlet

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
and then there were people that would go

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
holy shit this guy

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
wow Hamlet even

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
he can criticize

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
he's the best and then there were other people that would go

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
are you fucking kidding me

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
you lock you in a coffin

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
and throw it in the ocean criticizing Hamlet

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
go fuck yourself

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
and it was polarization

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
this guy

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
and the phrase he said

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
this community writer telling me about this guy

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
that really hit home with me was

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
oh it kind of warped this guy

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
which made me realize oh you know why it warped him

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
because he was thinking about

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
both of those things

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
because neither of those things are true

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
he should be allowed to just have an opinion

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
about Hamlet

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
and if he's prominent because of it

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
that's just tough titties for him

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
and tough titties for anybody that listens to him

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
he's not allowed anymore

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
to base his identity

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
on what people think about him

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
because he has entered the business of being prominent

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
whether he liked it or not

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
and boy oh boy

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I'm sure he looks forward to the day when he's not prominent anymore

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
but until then he's going to steer between

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
those columns

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
and affect it by the gravity on either side

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
there's some people saying he's a god

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
and some people saying he's a devil

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
and they're all full of shit

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
they're not talking about a person anymore

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
they're not talking about a guy who read Hamlet

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
that has a feeling about it

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
how does that relate to you

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
it means that I have to stay off of

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
forums, reddit, comment sections

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
all that stuff

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
because that's where people will say that I am a god

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
or a devil

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I cannot let that stuff affect me anymore

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
you're great

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
speaking of great, let's bring Spencer on stage

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
hey guys

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
how are you guys doing tonight

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
I'm not you audience

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
the two on stage

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Spencer's gotten mad with power

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
so do you ever

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
when a friend or a roommate or a family member

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
takes a shower

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
and right when the door opens

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
or right after

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
they open the door and it's like

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
hot and wet air

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
that's what's going into the green room tonight

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
was like

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
I'm sorry

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
it was certainly hot and wet

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
it was wet, that wasn't even Dan's fault

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
it was humid

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
it was my fault

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
the orchids were growing

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
it was

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
I sprayed a lot of Lysol

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
that always made it worse

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I think the poop rode on the Lysol particles

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
and distributed

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
out into the room

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
the thing that makes

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Lysol effervescent

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
cruise throughout the air, just carried your poop

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
like a magic carpet ride around the room

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:39.000
and your poop was wearing cheap cologne

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
nah, it's funny because

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
it smelled like shit

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
it takes a big man

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
to take that bigger shit

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
and an even bigger man to say

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I'm so sorry

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
here's why I don't think you're a big man about it

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
it was right before showtime

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
and you weren't there

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
part of you was there

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
a certain essence of you was there

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
that's not my fault

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
various molecules that you created were in there

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
but you were gone

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
like you left a scene of a crime

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
that's all at Aaron's doorstep

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
you can ask her about why I wasn't in there

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
she took the shit

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
are you covering for her shit?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
no, I'm throwing her under the bus

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
and then she can

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I'm leaving it up to her if she wants to talk about it or not

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
are you saying that that was her shit

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
no, it was my shit

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I swear to God

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I was sitting in that room

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
and actually feeling like in a weird medieval way

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
like I deserved to be sitting in here

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Neil, the documentary guy

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
over here

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
came in and I didn't say anything to him

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I don't have that kind of relationship with him

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I didn't say, sorry I took a huge shit

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
you might want to go

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
insert shot of the fucking specs

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
on the

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
look, fuck all of you

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I'm telling you my thought process

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I didn't

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
welcome him into that world but I knew that he was

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
probably sitting there going, why does meltdown

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
comics smell like human

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
fecal matter

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
and I was just kind of sitting there thinking, I deserve this

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
and then a conversation

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
came up between me and Neil

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
and Aaron had an emotional

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
reaction to it and took me out to the parking lot

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
that she wanted to talk to me about

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
and that's why I wasn't in the room

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
because otherwise I would have sat there

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
and owned it

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
and I deserved to inhale all of it

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
participated in our agony

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
and then it was only when I came back

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
because

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
you know how you leave a room and then

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
when you come back into it

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
it's like, holy shit

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:49.000
that's when I knew I had done a bad thing

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
maybe did a bad, bad thing

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
what was the

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
we should bring Aaron out

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Erin McGathy, join us

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
now

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
because honestly I'll leave it up to you

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
if you want to talk about it or not

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
really quick, you know when all of your friends

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
see a horror movie and they're like, oh god you gotta

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
see this movie, it's so scary, it's so terrifying

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
and you see it and you're like, I don't get it

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
that was like me walking into the bathroom after you had

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
I can't smell it anymore

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
wow

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Stockholm Syndrome

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
yeah, she's

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
you've identified

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
with the terrorism of Dan's asshole

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
as far as the parking lot incident

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
I'm not a proud person

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I'm not

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
proud of this but I don't

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
see Dan very often

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I was out of town

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
and I heard about

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
whenever I see Dan I'm always

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
asking him how was work, how was this thing

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
how was your walk to the store

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
what was that thing

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
and Dan's understandably tired

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
and doesn't tell me things

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Neil knew something that I didn't

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
that I was very excited about

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
so I got bummed out because I felt like

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
he didn't share with me

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I don't talk about work when I come home

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
there's so much going on

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
I'm semi-conscious of

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
how much I'm not telling you

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
kind of a little bit

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
it's not a big deal, I had a big reaction

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
to it because I was like

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
and it was unexpected that Neil came in

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
because Neil's making this documentary

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
the Harmontown documentary

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Neil Berkeley, fantastic filmmaker

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
the Harmontown documentary

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
is sort of

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
it tracks Spencer a little bit

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
as it should

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
a representative

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
of fans

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I don't know, whatever, he's interesting

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I'm a metaphor

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
it really has nothing to do with the documentary

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
my feelings, I just wanted to know

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I'm not explaining

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
anything about it

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I'm catching people up

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
on something

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
so because Neil's making this

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
movie that has to do with Spencer

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I told Spencer

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I think yesterday

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
something that I hadn't told anybody

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
which was that

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
I had recently, willy-nilly

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
in order to save myself some work

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I had cast Spencer in a role on Community

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
and so I told Neil

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I said, oh, Spencer's going to be shooting

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
next week

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
so you could come for your documentary

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
that would make a good final image

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:47.000
and see Spencer at it

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
so Jeff doesn't know that

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
you guys don't know that

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Neil knew that yesterday

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
and then Erin was in the green room smelling my shit

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Dan, can I go talk to you in the parking lot?

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
and

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
and Erin

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
felt like she was

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
she just feels locked out of my life

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
only because we had been talking, yeah because I just don't see him

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
it really has nothing to do with the information

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
it could have been

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
it's really not a big deal

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
it was a big deal at the time

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I mean we had to go to the parking lot

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I just wanted to

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
talk to you

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
well also because we had talked about it

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
before because it was something

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
that I was hoping was going to happen

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
so I felt like I was the last person to know

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
but I guess I wasn't, it's not a big deal

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
so anyways, that's why I wasn't in there when you were smelling my shit

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
it's because

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Erin didn't know I cast Spencer

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
well, alright

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
whatever

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
now I feel weird

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
well

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I understand at least so, Spencer

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
it's super super not about you, I just felt

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I'm making it about me

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
no, no, please do

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I feel embarrassed, I feel a little

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I don't know, I'm kind of, I don't know

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
jealous, it's kind of a personal thing

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
no, I mean I feel jealous

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
because Dan

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
works at community all hours of the day

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I feel a little thrown under the bus

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
right now, I just

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
want to talk to you, it really has nothing to do with anything

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
no, I don't, yeah

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
you didn't know that I had done this thing

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Lorraine Newman, come on up here

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
ugh

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
uh, no

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
the guy, the Lorraine Newman

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Genie

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
committed to his role, no

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
I like that guy

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
who is the guy, I picture him

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
as this giant bald

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Mr. Clean, like white t-shirt guy

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
with his arms folded, biceps as big as his head

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
going, no

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
925

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
what does that mean

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I think it means, I think it means

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
the dungeons are alive

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
there's a gentleman in the front row handing

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Aaron a gift

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
oh, thank you, it's like

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
it's a game, it's a geek eye game, because I like games

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
thank you sir

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
ah

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
I mean, this is a bummer, I've been so happy all day

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I mean, nothing is wrong

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
I'm happy

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
no one, no one watched the way that I put it

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
you can really feel the happiness

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
no, I'm fine

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
if it was my show, there would be a whole thing

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
with Dan in the parking lot and

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
I'm just kidding, it's totally fine

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Lorraine

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
no

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
she promised you would be here

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
alright, Spencer

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
what's up you guys

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
why don't you hand out our character sheets

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
give the people what they may or may not want

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
a little D&D

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
they go from the top down

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
it's yours and then hers and then his

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I know how character sheets go

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I see you pass them out every day

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000
you clearly do not

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
yeah

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
thanks by the way to Glenn Cook

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
for that earth shine

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
is the bottle still there

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
can we fireman line that down to me

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I want another sniff

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
you can just say pass

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Instagram the label, it's great

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
I love the concept of earth shine

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Spencer you have all handed that to

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
oh Jeffrey

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
this is probably what I do

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
you guys he's been sober for 20 years

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
he's a bad moment

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
he's a very sad moment

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
he lost his kids

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
he lost his kids

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
the camera blurs and becomes a documentary

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
about Andy Dick

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
okay

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
that gulp I took was ambitious

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
no that was, I saw bubbles come up

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
how do you

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
I was like a Pepsi commercial

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
done skateboarding, time to take a swig

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
how do you

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
how do you open that

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
I'm gonna fuck so many creatures of D&D

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
I've got that moonshine rage going on

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I just cringe watching it

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
why are you looking at me this way

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
you don't love me enough

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.000
this show got white trashy real fast

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Spencer if you would

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
okay

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Kumail's not here I guess

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
he's always got call types

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
he misses you guys so much and I hope you back as soon as you can

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
I miss Kumail so much

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
are we casting a Chris de Burgh this one

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
a durak

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
moustache

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
a friend of yours

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I was looking at character sheets when he came up

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I would have called it out earlier

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
how do you know Spencer

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Ian how do you know Spencer

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I live in a house with his brother

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
I've known Spencer for years

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
sounds freaky

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
sounds freaky

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
I have the thin moustache

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
cause I was just in a play

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
it was a dinner theater play we played it in Oxnard

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
at a place called the kitchen

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
and I will be the other character

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
and in post

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
and things like that

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000

I'm passing the schematics for a jet pack

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
across the bar

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
it doesn't matter

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
if the Nazis get a hold of it

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
we're all dead

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
you got it

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
I want this to go on for the rest of my life

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
I think we should end there

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
yeah we'll stop it there

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:09.000
that's probably better

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Ian that was very satisfying for all concerns

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Ian are you familiar

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
with Kumail's character Chris de Burgh

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I am familiar

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
he likes to throw a knife with a string attached

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
correct he has a ribbon dagger now

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
he's a rogue

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
don't worry about it follow your heart Ian

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
he's a rogue

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
he's good at picking locks

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
he likes trouble

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
and he's very cautious about tying weapons

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
to strings and shit

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
one more time if you will take us back

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
he likes trouble

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
he loves trouble

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
here we are

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
when we last met

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
our heroes had slain breffi

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
in his metal web in dark stars evil lair

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
that's right

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
they climbed up and out

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
of the lava to higher ground

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
before surveying the above

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
surveying their surroundings above

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
they were in a new room

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
full of horrifically slaughtered corpses

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
the dead bodies of

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Admiral Darkstars dark cultist

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
then coincidentally

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
yurch the knoll showed up

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
the smelly savage was acting suspiciously

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
drawing the attention of quark and sharpie

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
using powerful magic

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
sharpie read the knoll's mind

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
and covered his evil thoughts

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
apparently yurch had been practicing blood magic

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
he used his blood magic

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
to attack the party but the a party

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
attacked back

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
whatever

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
after dodging his blood spells

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
quark let loose a

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
yeah quark let loose a mighty

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
far sword blast that cut yurch

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
clean in two slaying the evil

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
knoll but as the party

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
headed onward a voice rang out

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
you'll pay for what you've done

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
to our blood brother

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
swore a shadowy figure in the darkness

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
but before the gang could pursue

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
this figure it dispersed

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
confused our heroes charged up the stairs

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
and into the top of dark stars

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
dark tower where they found

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
the man himself

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Admiral Darkstar

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
cut the music

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
yeah

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
see

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
yeah so

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
so you just ran up to the top of these stairs

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
and you see in the middle of this room

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
you don't see anything but a massive

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
pillar of black crystal and standing

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
atop that black crystal

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
is Admiral Darkstar fully

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
clad in his black plated armor

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
in a black cape

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
on his body and he screams

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
out at you as soon as you come up he

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
you fools have played

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
right into my plan

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I mean

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
it would be easy to get you to gather

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
all the shards but I never

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
expected you to bring them right

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
to my layer

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
now I will collect your shards and

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I'll just run a dawn of the dark star

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
oh boy

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
kind of gave all our shards away on the way

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
here

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
you don't have them

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
here's the thing about elaborate

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
plans like yours

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
they involve too much

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
choice on the part of the

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
people being drawn in we kind of

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
on the way here we felt like we needed

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
skeletons

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
well no matter I still have

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
at the rope that's binding us

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
okay they're tentacles

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000

do I have any broken glass

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:19.000
you have actual weapons

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
designed for

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
hurting other things

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
more realizes that

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
she's not going to win with

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
using crafts

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
my brain shattering

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I pull the knife

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
out of my knife holder

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
hacking away at the

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
at the ropes

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
now that's not

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
some crowd reaction

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000

where are these tentacles that are holding us

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
coming out of the very ground itself

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
I try to like grapple

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000

I gotta put it at Dan's turn

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000

being to entangle yeah

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
could I assume

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
control of an entangling vine

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
it's not really a vine

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
all right okay

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
130 proof

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
I saw that was

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
those impressive it was really good

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
all right well then I'll

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
can I I can't recast reduced

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
person on myself can I you could

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
and it slipped out of the

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
the serpentine grasp of these

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
things sure all right

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
reductum self

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
them

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
reducing yourself

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
to a gnome sized size

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
you quickly

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
jump out of your binds and away

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
from the grasping

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
tentacles

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
so

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
so so dark star

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
he tries to get up

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
with Mulraine on him

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
do you want to try to like

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
hold him down or yeah

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
yeah for sure

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I try to make him think

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
that he's in a

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
I'm just gonna to punish myself

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
and complete my sentence

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
I

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I'm going to try to make him think that he's

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
in a different biome by the way

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
that I am sitting on his head

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
wait

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
take that to me

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
come again

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
I want him to believe

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
that he's in a different place

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
let's see

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
roll it

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
wait what

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
he tries to pull himself up and goes

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I feel like I'm in a swamp or some

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
biome

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
it's nothing to brag about

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
and he

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
he tries to get up

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
but he doesn't so and said he

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
kind of swings his arm and tries to punch

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
you in the kidney

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
tries

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
little does he know I have no kidneys

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
well

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
either that or he just missed

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
but in any case

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
your kidneys are fine

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
they've not been impacted by anything

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
great I continue to

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
sit on his face

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
putting it up

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Jeff's turn

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
I go into a barbarian rage to get myself free

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
from these tentacles

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
throwing yourself into a barbarian rage

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
you strain against your binds

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
yeah

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
you free yourself

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
yeah

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
thank you

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
thank you for that

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
do I have an action now

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
you burst forth in a show of energy

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
it was a really fast style

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I take my mighty sword and I slash

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
at

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Admiral Darkstar

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
alright

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
you charge at Admiral Darkstar and slash

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
with your mighty sword

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
and you critically fail

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
oops

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
so running towards him

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
you swing your sword back

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
and you let go of it

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
and it just flies behind your back

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
being a gnome this weight difference

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
affects you greatly

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
and you topple on to your face

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
and you do like three

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
somersault kind of spins before

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
landing on your back

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
wow

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
I get up and I go

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
oopsie

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
you take three damage from skidding on the ground

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Jesus Christ

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
alright I have a quick question so

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
if I have this what is bluefin poison

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
is that like bad sushi

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
what's more like

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
puffer fish

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
can I put that on my knife

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
yep sweet

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
you can do anything you want in this game

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
give him a sneak attack

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
it's your rogue

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
so I'm going to

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
sneak attack this guy

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
with the bluefin poison on my knife

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
use the poison dagger

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
through my heart

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
attacking at his back

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
with your poison dagger

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
you plunge it directly between two

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
you know plates of his armor

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
thrusting it into the spot

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
where his meat is

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
wow

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
that's not cool

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
well I mean that's what Christopher does right

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
he is right for the meat

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
dealing

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
what's 5 divided by 2

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
round it down

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
thank you

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
2 damage plus sneak attack damage

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
which is 4

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
and 5 what's that you guys

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
13 15 damage

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
he doesn't seem too bothered by the poison

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
for whatever reason

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
otherwise it's been hurt

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
never saw it coming

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I'm super racist

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
must be nice

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
black people problems

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
I know

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
I mean if I'm racist for one second

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
it's like

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
it's okay I give you permission

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I'll even give you a black card

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
do you want one

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
what would I do with that

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
would I just like imply

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
for one minute

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
just give it back

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
to the arresting officer

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
just say I don't need it

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
I like this

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
I'm enjoying this

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I'll put it at more

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
okay

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
from my position

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I take

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
two of my

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
arrows

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
and I

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
because I'm sitting on his head

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
I take my two arrows

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
and I try to stab them through his ears

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
into his brain

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
that's vicious

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
that's a combat maneuver

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
it's called the brain poke

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
the brain poke

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
brain poke

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
I don't know how I could possibly miss

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
well I mean in this case

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
it would be because he's wearing a helmet

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
no no I guess you mistook my meeting

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
you hit with one of your arrows

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
in his head but not the other

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
one of them pierces through his helmeted head

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
and stabs him right in the

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
ear right ear

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
yeah yeah but inside

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
inside inside

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
goes through the ear

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
into his head parts

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
to his brain

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
to his head meat

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
right into his head meat

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
and maybe now he's like the cheerleader who can only run backwards

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
you know what I mean

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
yeah he can't sing anymore or something

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
I like that

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
but that doesn't happen to him

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
he just gets hit for six damage

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
I'll take it

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
blood flows out of his ear

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
I drink it

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
that's what you guys were thinking right

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I spear it on my face

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I write like a big okay

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
on my forehead

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.000
oh god

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Mulraine

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
have more moonshine

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
earth shines

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
you're gonna need to see a doctor after this

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
that's Dan's turn then

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
all right Sharpie

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
so I have this level three spell

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
and it's called major image

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
illusion with sound

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
smell and heat

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
so that's a pretty convincing

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
I think you cast that

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
in the green room before the show

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
you dealt my nose

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
14 damage

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
it was a critical shit

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
that's our show right

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:21.000
after the show

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
that's the end of Harmontown

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
not just the show

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
that's been our show goodnight

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
I'm kidding

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I'm kidding

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
they want it out of here

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
but that's the show title for sure right

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
it was a critical shit

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
that was a boss

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
yeah

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
I

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
I want to create an illusion

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
yeah of a woman

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
that looks 20 years older

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
than Admiral Darkstar

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
is making its rounds again

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
guys remember when Jeff said critical shit

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
that was so

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
that was so good

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
I mean

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
basket it

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
oh

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
the beautiful thing is

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I made that guy's fictional mom

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
yelling him for peeing

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:17.000
after when

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Dan are you talking about the fictional mom

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
that threatened to bite off her son's penis

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
with her dentures

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
a little bit of red dragon

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
a little bit of autobiography in there

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I'll let you figure out which

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
sorry so

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Spencer have you rolled that

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
what no no

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
he cast angry mommy memory

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
yeah come on

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
angry mommy memory

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
yeah so you

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Admiral Dexter you knock it off

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
he looks at this illusion

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
and he's like I don't have a mom

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
I mean

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
it's

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
it's yeah

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
he says that out loud

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
yeah I go

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
everyone has a mom

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
maybe you didn't know yours

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
maybe you don't understand

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
the cosmology of all the different planes

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
in the multiverse

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
maybe

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
maybe I don't but

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
maybe the one thing

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
that all of them share

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
is that everyone comes from a mama

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
and maybe

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
when you don't know yours you get a little

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
angry

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
and you want to make the cosmology

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
more significant than it is

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
when it really comes down to simple realities

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
right Gertrude

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
and then I make her go that's right

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
this little shit

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
go to your room

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
and I go yeah if you didn't

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
know her I just

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
I think that suggests

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
sure maybe he

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
remember better if you sang

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
your song everybody comes

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
from a mama

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
it's a great song it's a great song I've heard it

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
anyway

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
just roll for it

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
yeah

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I don't want to negate that but it'll just be bad

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
I'll drop you a beat if you want

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
