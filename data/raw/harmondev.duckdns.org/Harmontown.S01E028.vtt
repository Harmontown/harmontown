{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:02.000\nThere.\n\n00:11.000 --> 00:13.000\nCharlotte, North Carolina.\n\n00:13.000 --> 00:14.000\nWelcome.\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:18.000\nHarmontown is now officially in session everybody.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:20.000\nOh yeah.\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:23.000\nWhat is this? Day 5?\n\n00:23.000 --> 00:24.000\nDay 6? I have no idea.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:28.000\nWe've been on tour and it feels like we're members of the Donner party. It's wild.\n\n00:28.000 --> 00:31.000\nI woke up and Spencer was gnawing on my leg.\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:35.000\nPlease welcome the mayor of Harmontown to the stage, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:42.000\nThank you. Thank you very much.\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:46.000\nEverybody calm down. Calm down.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:49.000\nSorry. No, it's okay. I didn't mean to yell at you.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:54.000\nWell, tonight's going to be a very interesting night. I promise you that.\n\n00:54.000 --> 01:00.000\nLast night in Nashville, the episode was only just being uploaded.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:02.000\nI almost hope none of you heard it.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:10.000\nControl was lost. Things broke down. The audience was fantastic. They were wonderful.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:16.000\nMy drinking was unforgivable.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:21.000\nThe audience was loaded in and nice and early to escape the cold.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:24.000\nWe did Jagger bombs with them in the back.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:28.000\nI took the stage already pretty sloshy.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:30.000\nWe went up to the stage pretty tipsy.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:44.000\nThen about 20 minutes into it, we had a representative self-proclaimed hillbilly come up and treat us to moonshine out of a jar.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:52.000\nThen I took a sip and then everything else was sort of a blackout until I listened to the recording today.\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:58.000\nI was editing it. I'll tell you this. I'll confide in you, Charlotte, because I'm relying on you to be a confidant tonight.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:02.000\nWe're going to have a quiet, dignified, thoughtful, mature show.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:05.000\nI want to start with this confession to you.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:12.000\nAs an editor of Harmontown, I have never made more shame-based edits to a Harmontown recording.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:17.000\nUsually, if there's any editing of a Harmontown recording, what you're hearing is I'll just lift, like, you know, I'll go,\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nhey, welcome to Harmontown.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:22.000\nAnd some lady in the back will go, how is Zuckie Dick?\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:24.000\nAnd I'll go, what did you say?\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:25.000\nAnd the mic won't pick her up.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:28.000\nShe said she wants a Zuckie Dick, Jeff.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:31.000\nAnd then it'll be kind of a weird, like, we'll bring her up here.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:35.000\nAnd then you'll hear kind of like a burp, burp, burp, burp.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:37.000\nOkay, take that mic.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:38.000\nI'll lift that stuff.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:42.000\nSo we'll just cut, you know, we'll just, a nice tight, I want a Zuckie Dick.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:43.000\nHey, what's your name?\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:44.000\nNancy?\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:50.000\nI'll just lift things to keep the podcast listener happy.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:55.000\nBut this morning in the hotel room as I was listening to the Nashville show, I was editing things because it was like,\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:57.000\nI sound like a monster.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:01.000\nI don't want anyone or their mother to hear it.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:05.000\nThere were some very long raps and very long songs that...\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:12.000\nI don't know if any of you are Beach Boys fans, but Brian Wilson had a period following that raps.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:14.000\nPost Kokomo.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:16.000\nYeah.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:22.000\nWhere if you were hearing the words Brian Wilson, it was because he was just popping up at some venue and just sort of like,\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:25.000\njust kind of Gary Busey-ing all over the place.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:28.000\nI became Gary Busey last night. It was uncomfortable.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:32.000\nThere was a documentary crew there to film it, so when this movie comes out for $5 online,\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:36.000\nI'm sure you can watch me make an ass of myself. I'm sure that'll be what the movie's about.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:40.000\nBut that's why I decided that tonight is going to be...\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:47.000\nI picked this spot because for you podcast listeners, the comedy zone here in Charlotte is...\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:51.000\nit couldn't be a better place to have an undersold show.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:54.000\nIt's sort of a concrete construction.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:58.000\nI think Hitler killed himself here.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:01.000\nWe're in a day of the dead bunker.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:05.000\nWe are absolutely safe from anything that might happen outside.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nI don't think cell phones work down here.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:10.000\nThere's a lot of concrete around us.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:16.000\nWe're in our parents' basement. It's time to make stained glass and get hit with belts.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:19.000\nAnd get to know each other.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:23.000\nAnd I respect you guys, and I'm coming to you on my knees.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nPlease forgive me for what happened in Nashville.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:28.000\nPlease let me find a new home here in Charlotte.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:34.000\nPlease let's get to know each other in an intelligent, sophisticated, mature way, Jeff.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:41.000\nI want to have a decent show, a show you could bring your parents to a little bit.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:48.000\nAnd I think one of the serious things that we have to talk about is this Harmontown government that we're forming.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:54.000\nI think it's time to cross the threshold, Jeff, of actually getting serious about this.\n\n04:54.000 --> 05:01.000\nBecause we're going to colonize the moon or we're not. In any case, I think it's time for Harmontown and its followers to say,\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:04.000\nthis is who we are, this is what we believe.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:12.000\nLet's separate ourselves from the United States and everything else and just become a criminal organization.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:17.000\nWhat if I don't believe in government? What if I don't like government?\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:21.000\nWell, you shouldn't. Government's bad. Government's somebody telling somebody else what to do.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:26.000\nI don't agree with that. That's what the United States is founded on, the principle that people telling people what to do is a bad idea.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:29.000\nThen somehow we got all caught up in doing it again.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:37.000\nSome people that defend it, they have to reduce themselves to weird mental riddles by going like,\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:40.000\noh, you don't believe that? Well, what if someone was stepping out of baby's head?\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:44.000\nWell, I'm not in favor of stepping out of baby's head. You got me.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:49.000\nWell, then you should vote for so-and-so, because otherwise the baby's head doesn't step down.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:54.000\nThat's silly. You're stepping on a theoretical baby's head. You're bullying me.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:58.000\nEveryone should be allowed to do whatever they want to do, right?\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:02.000\nWe all agree with that. Everyone should be allowed to do whatever they want to do.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:11.000\nThen there's this problem that we run up against where what if me wanting to do whatever I want to do interferes with someone else wanting to do whatever they want to do.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:20.000\nA tiny example, I want to smoke in this room. I want to light up a cigarette, because that's what I want to do.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:25.000\nThen there's a bunch of people going, I don't want to inhale your secondhand smoke.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:36.000\nA very classic example. There's got to be a way, Jeff, to create a rule, a system of thinking, where we could walk through that scenario\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:45.000\nin the same way, apply it to a serial killer. We don't have to have 8,000 laws.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:50.000\nThere's got to be a way, Jeff, to create a little logarithm.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:57.000\nI think it's a thing called courtesy. Self-awareness. Awareness of your surroundings and awareness of the needs and desires of other people.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:01.000\nThat's something that people don't have enough of. People just don't consider other people.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:07.000\nDo we have anybody here tonight that has sort of a, well, okay, this might be embarrassing.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:10.000\nI understand you don't want to participate in this.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.000\nRaise your hand if you came alone. Okay.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:14.000\nThe whole audience?\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:17.000\nThere's a whole table for the people that came alone.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:20.000\nSo you guys just got sat together because you're, okay.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:27.000\nAll right, so all of you guys came alone. Everyone look at them. They all came alone.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nBut they're not leaving alone.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:32.000\nNo, they're not. You're all getting laid tonight.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:35.000\nWe're going to do a square dance at the end of the show.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nRemember square dancing?\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nNo, I'm from Southern California. That's not a thing.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:43.000\nDid you guys do square dancing in your Phi Ed classes?\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nYes.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nOkay, yeah.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:50.000\nIt was a weird thing where they took everybody and forced them to touch each other.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:55.000\nIt was always so that people like me could make physical contact with girls\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:59.000\nand with sweaty, gross hands would touch theirs.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nDosey dough and promenade.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:04.000\nYou're just being forced to touch people that would never touch you.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:07.000\nI had fancy square dancing. We had Catillion.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nDid anybody have that?\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:10.000\nYeah, it's really, yeah.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:11.000\nCatillion was weird.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nThere was a lady and she had castanets for some reason.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nThat's how she got your attention.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nEverybody!\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nThat was our thing.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:25.000\nAll right, who's having the worst time tonight?\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:26.000\nOkay, good.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nWe just started.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nThey're all having a really bad time.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nAll right, one of you guys that came here alone,\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:36.000\nI need you to be like the secretary for tonight,\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:39.000\nbecause we're going to make a system of laws.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nI actually have a parent paper.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nOkay, all right.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nYour name's Ben, right? We met you before the show.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:49.000\nBen, could you come up here and introduce yourself to the audience?\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:52.000\nBen's kind of an interesting guy.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nI think you'll see that.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nSure.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:59.000\nBefore he told me what he did for a living,\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:03.000\nmy guess was surveillance.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:07.000\nHe's dressed a bit like a magician.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nHe's got a shaved head.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:13.000\nHis face doesn't change expression much.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:16.000\nHe could be either about to hug you or kill you.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\nThank you.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nHe looks a little like Anton LeVe.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nAnton LeVe?\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nI've gotten Lenin, too, actually.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nYeah, you look a little bit like that.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:26.000\nYeah, all right.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nWell, can you take some notes for us?\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:31.000\nWe're going to try to figure this out throughout the night,\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:33.000\nwhat our system of laws should be.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nAll right, take this down.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nTake dictation.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:42.000\nWe, the people of Harmontown, blah, blah, blah.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:47.000\nPut some fancy shit in there.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:51.000\nNobody should ever have to do anything they don't want to do.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:54.000\nEveryone should be able to do whatever they want to do.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:57.000\nIf you wanted to do whatever you want to do,\n\n09:57.000 --> 10:00.000\ninterferes with someone wanting to do whatever they want to do, dot, dot, dot.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:01.000\nThat's what we have to figure out.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nWe'll figure that out by the end of the night.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nNow, we were in Atlanta and somebody said,\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:06.000\ntrial by death or something like that.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:07.000\nFight to the death.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nIt doesn't really work, because if I want to punch you in the face,\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nyou don't want to get punched in the face,\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nyou just punch you in the face and then say,\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:16.000\ntrial by death, and that's just bullying.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.000\nIt doesn't work.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nYou just have people that want to punch people,\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nwalking up to people and punching them.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:25.000\nI think the idea of making a bubble throat.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:26.000\nYeah, you don't want that.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nYou can't do a bubble throat around Dan Harmon\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:31.000\nbecause he comes down and you're like a sack of bricks.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:32.000\nI don't think there should be a Constitution.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:33.000\nHow about that?\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nI think the moment you start writing down any sort of law,\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nthen that's when you're screwed.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:40.000\nYou can say, are we guarantee free speech?\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nThat's the last time there is such a thing as free speech,\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nbecause then for the rest of time,\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:48.000\nlawyers start closing like a big net around what makes free speech.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nYou'll fire in a private thing and you can't say something.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:51.000\nI heard somebody's feeling free.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:52.000\nSpeech is never free again.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.000\nI think what you're doing right now is dangerous.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:55.000\nYeah, no, it's illegal.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:57.000\nI'm a terrorist.\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nI'm declaring myself a terrorist.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:02.000\nBen used to work for an organization to fight terrorism.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:03.000\nOh yeah, that's right.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:04.000\nWe met Ben at the bar earlier.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:05.000\nWhat's it called?\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:09.000\nIt's called the NIFA Foundation, 9-Eleven Finding Answers.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\n9-Eleven Finding Answers.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:15.000\nIt's a non-governmental agency you said that's dedicated to.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:18.000\nAre you going to get in trouble saying what you're saying?\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:20.000\nI don't think so.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:23.000\nI don't think anyone involved in the organization actually carries a gun\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:27.000\nin an official capacity, so they'll have to get creative\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nif they want to come after me.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:32.000\nAnd you're a substitute teacher now, right, Pat?\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nYes.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:37.000\nDoes that explain a lot about growing up in your schools?\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:40.000\nAnd we came into the bar and he had one headphone in,\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nand that's why Dan thought he worked in surveillance,\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:45.000\nand we said, no, it's much nerdier than what you think it was.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:48.000\nIt was me listening to the works of Tacitus.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:49.000\nYes.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:50.000\nAwesome.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:52.000\nPart one of the annals.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:54.000\nYeah, the good one.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:55.000\nOh yeah.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:58.000\nPart two drags a bit.\n\n11:58.000 --> 11:59.000\nThat's our fans.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nIt's a guy at a bar who looks like Vladimir Lenin,\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:04.000\nand he's listening to Tacitus.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:05.000\nThat's awesome.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:08.000\nNicknames for Charlotte, Jeff.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:10.000\nWant me to make one up?\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nThe Queen City.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:16.000\nA little offensive.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:18.000\nCrown Town.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nObviously a reference to Queen City.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nThe Hornets Nest.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nOoh.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nThat's a political one.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nThe Home of NASCAR.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nThat's a nickname for that.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:30.000\nThe Gem of the South.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nThat's adorable.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nThat goes with Queen City.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nWhy is it called Queen City?\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nYeah, I couldn't understand it.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nQueen Charlotte.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nNow, who was Queen Charlotte?\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nShe was the Queen.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:43.000\nRight, okay.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nThat's a good guess.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nAnd also, wasn't Charlotte the home,\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nor was it just North Carolina?\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:52.000\nI was reading something about the only successful\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nU.S. coup d'etat\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nthat happened here\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:57.000\nin the 1860s.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nNot in a good way, really.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nIt was like a bunch of white dudes\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:05.000\nthat were pretty mad about the way things shook out\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:06.000\nin the Civil War,\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nand they just kind of took something over.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nIt was very complicated stuff\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:12.000\nthat I did not have time to research over a drink.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:16.000\nI try to Wikipedia every city that we go to.\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nIncredibly boring town you have here.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:22.000\nIt's very, very complicated.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\nEverything's very nuanced.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nYou have to have like a 300 IQ\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:28.000\nto understand the history of Charlotte.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:29.000\nIn Atlanta, we were like,\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:31.000\nah, there's railroads, and everyone's racist,\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:34.000\nor, you know, it was fun in Nashville,\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.000\nand you're like, oh, Elvis was invented here.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:39.000\nCharlotte, like, you got to really put the glasses on\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:40.000\nand roll up your sleeves.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:41.000\nYou should be proud of that fact,\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nand that's why we're going to have a quiet, thoughtful evening\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:47.000\nin a military bunker here at the Comedy Zone.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:50.000\nAre you guys from here, or is this like a commuter town?\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nI'm definitely not from here.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:53.000\nYou're not from here?\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nWhere are you from?\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nFlorida.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\nFlorida, you have an accent that I can't play.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nNo, I grew up in Newcastle.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nNewcastle, okay.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:07.000\nNewcastle, like the English Stephen King company?\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:08.000\nYeah, that's bad.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:09.000\nHe grew up in a Stephen King company.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nThat's Castle Rock, sorry.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nI don't know, look, just...\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nI think you're making the show too dignified.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.000\nOkay.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:20.000\nAll right, well, you want to spice it up with a...\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:21.000\nI don't know.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:24.000\nYou want to do a quick rap about Charlotte?\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:26.000\nYes.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:34.000\nYeah, let's kick this shit into overdrive.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nYo, yo, yo, Charlotte.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:39.000\nYo, gateway to Carolina.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nAll the mountains couldn't look fine.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nLooking like Titty's gonna stroke him.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nI fucked your mama.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nI like to poke him in the butt.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nFucked her in the butt.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nFucked your mama all the way down and up.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nThrew her in the sky.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nFucked her in the eye.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nPut my dick in her nose till she died.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:58.000\nFucked your mama to death.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nFucked your mama till she ran out of breath.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:01.000\nDon't you're in the pool.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nLifted her out.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.000\nFucked your mama.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nI got that clout.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:07.000\nAll right.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:08.000\nOkay, all right.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:09.000\nThanks.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:10.000\nThanks, guys.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:12.000\nThanks, Charlotte.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:13.000\nThanks.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:14.000\nThanks.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:17.000\nIt's a classy show.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:21.000\nI need like a big Masterpiece Theater armchair up here.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:25.000\nJust a shelf of books.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nHow are you holding up on this trip so far, Daniel?\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:30.000\nWhat are we, like, a third of the way, fourth of the way through?\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:31.000\nI'm good.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:32.000\nI like all the cities we're going to.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:33.000\nAnd everybody's been delightful.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:37.000\nAnd everywhere we go, it's just like, you know, the Harmontown fans.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nYou guys all listen to the podcast, right?\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:45.000\nI'm trying to, I'm scanning the audience for people who don't.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:48.000\nI feel like I have to ask this every, because we go to these comedy clubs,\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:51.000\nand I know some of the comedy clubs, like, they fill seats.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:56.000\nIs there anybody here, be honest, that just got convinced to come here,\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:59.000\nand then thought that you were going to be seeing stand up?\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:00.000\nUh-oh.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:01.000\nOkay.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:02.000\nAll right.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nI'm sorry, you guys.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:15.000\nDan Harmon created a television show called Community, right now.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:19.000\nAnd now he thinks that he has a right to travel the country and stand up,\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:24.000\nget drunk on stage, and have no plans, and no act to speak of.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:25.000\nSorry.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:31.000\nBut in my defense, you'd get the same from Rob Schneider.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:34.000\nHe's still working off the same 10 minutes from 1989.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:35.000\nI bet you.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:36.000\nHe's going to do Elvis on a fish hook,\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:39.000\nand then he's going to be talking about the government for 90.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:40.000\nThat's not true.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:41.000\nRob Schneider's here next week.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:42.000\nCome see him.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:49.000\nBut I do apologize to the, by my count,\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:53.000\nsix people that were duped into coming here under the impression that I might be\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:56.000\nlike a sort of Bobby Lee figure.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nI do apologize.\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nI could try to do stand up.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:03.000\nGive me a topic.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:04.000\nHockey.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:08.000\nWhat is with this sport, huh?\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nIt's certainly not for black people.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nOh.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:15.000\nThat was my bad.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:19.000\nYou can't do a Chris Rock mic drop during somebody else's act.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:22.000\nFor the listeners, that wasn't me dropping the Mike Chris Rock style.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:26.000\nThat was Ben, Ben, Ben dropped his mic.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:28.000\nAnd I want answers.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nI mean, you got a bunch of ice and they're out there,\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:33.000\nand it's like, like, like what are you, you're hitting a puck back and forth\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nand a puck.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:35.000\nWell, what is that?\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:36.000\nA Shakespeare reference?\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:37.000\nAll right.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:42.000\nSorry.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nIt probably won't work.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:47.000\nIf it was that easy, I think everybody would do it.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nI apologize again.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nI'll be apologizing throughout the night.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:54.000\nI'm certainly sorry to the city of Nashville for what we did there.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:55.000\nI drank too much.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nI think at one point I was naked.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:00.000\nI'll do it tonight too for you guys if you want.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:05.000\nYou wouldn't believe what my body looks like.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:08.000\nIt's covered in hair.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:15.000\nThe weirdest thing about my naked body is that I'm covered shoulder to ankle in\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nthis Chewbacca coat.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:22.000\nBut it looks like I'm wearing skin socks.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nDoes anyone else have that condition?\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nI don't have any hair.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nYou're like a reverse hobbit.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:28.000\nYeah.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:31.000\nDoes anyone else have that happening?\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:32.000\nNobody.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nOkay.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nActually, yeah, kind of.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nOh, yeah?\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:37.000\nOkay.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nKeep taking notes, Ben.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:45.000\nWe, the people of Harmontown, such and such, et cetera, et cetera, having been\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:51.000\nappalled by the state of this nation here in this bunker where Hitler killed himself\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:58.000\nwith sound, mind and body, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, make it sound fancy.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:03.000\nWe choose to be terrorists and criminals.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:06.000\nYou guys don't have to follow me on this if you don't want to.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:09.000\nYou can choose to apt out on your way out.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:12.000\nBut please buy a t-shirt.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:14.000\nAll right, let's work the crowd, Jeff.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.000\nAll right.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\nDo you want some music for this?\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nYeah, just some transitional music.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:22.000\nOkay, let me force up some transitional up.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:29.000\nWorking the crowd going outside.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:32.000\nYou thought I was on the stage, but now I'm nationwide.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:35.000\nI'm in your face, in the darkness, sticking mics in your face.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nIt's starkness.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:37.000\nOh, shit.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:38.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:39.000\nTrevor.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:40.000\nFuck you.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nOh, shit.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:43.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:44.000\nBlair.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:45.000\nMy condolences.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:46.000\nOh, shit.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:47.000\nWhere are you from?\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:48.000\nWilmington.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nHow do you know when you're finished?\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nWhoa.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:55.000\nGet a look at this guy's hat.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nMake fun of his hat.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\nGo.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:04.000\nWhere'd you get that hat?\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:06.000\nFuck you for wearing a hat.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:10.000\nFuck you for wearing a hat.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:11.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:12.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:13.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:14.000\nSorry.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:15.000\nI ran into music.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.000\nAll right.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:17.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.000\nYeah, take us out of the music.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:21.000\nThis is not the kind of show I wanted to do.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:26.000\nJust so you guys know, this is Dan not being drunk.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nI got out of control last night in Nashville.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:32.000\nI'm making up for it with a quiet, dignified show.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nWhat's your name, ma'am?\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:34.000\nKatie.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:35.000\nKatie.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nDo you live here in Charlotte?\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:38.000\nYeah.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:39.000\nYou didn't drive that far.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:43.000\nStill have your coat on in case you need to bolt.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:44.000\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nCan I ask?\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:46.000\nI don't have a job.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:47.000\nOkay.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:51.000\nHow do you know when you're finished, blah, blah, blah?\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:52.000\nCan we get you a job?\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nWhat do you want to do?\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:57.000\nWhat do you want me to do?\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:02.000\nI want you to rap.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nRap down.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nBreak, break down.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:05.000\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:10.000\nNo, seriously, what would you do if you could do anything?\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.000\nI want to be a TV writer.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:13.000\nAll right.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:14.000\nAll right.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:15.000\nLet's give her a job writing TV.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:18.000\nYeah, you got a couple new shows coming up.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:21.000\nYeah, I should be writing them right now.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:24.000\nAre you stuck in any script points that maybe she could help you out?\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nYou could test her chops right now?\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:27.000\nYeah, I guess so.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:28.000\nProbably.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.000\nWould that work?\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nYeah.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:31.000\nDo you like consulting with other people while you're writing a script?\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:32.000\nSure, sure, sure.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:33.000\nI guess so.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:34.000\nWe could figure out something.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.000\nIt was Katie?\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:36.000\nYeah.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:37.000\nAll right.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nKatie, come on up.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:39.000\nLet's rate a TV show together.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:44.000\nOkay, we're going to walk around this way.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:47.000\nYou don't have to run.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:48.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:52.000\nI just do it because I'm like a little baby.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:53.000\nOkay.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:56.000\nAll right.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:59.000\nMost important thing, Katie, is write what you know.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:04.320\nLike TV executives, they're suspicious of people who actually want to pitch them ideas\n\n22:04.320 --> 22:05.320\nand stuff.\n\n22:05.320 --> 22:10.880\nThey want to hear from people who actually are talking from a place of ownership.\n\n22:10.880 --> 22:16.240\nSo if you go, when I was growing up in Puerto Rico, I had a mother that was so crazy and\n\n22:16.240 --> 22:18.080\nthen they go, holy shit, this guy's the real deal.\n\n22:18.080 --> 22:19.680\nWe're going to have like a flavorful show.\n\n22:19.680 --> 22:22.200\nIt's going to be spicy and amazing.\n\n22:22.200 --> 22:23.200\nThat guy could be lying.\n\n22:23.200 --> 22:24.200\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n22:24.200 --> 22:28.880\nBut so let's start with, were you born in Charlotte?\n\n22:28.880 --> 22:29.880\nNo.\n\n22:29.880 --> 22:30.880\nOkay.\n\n22:30.880 --> 22:31.880\nWhere were you born?\n\n22:31.880 --> 22:32.880\nNew Orleans.\n\n22:32.880 --> 22:33.880\nNew Orleans.\n\n22:33.880 --> 22:34.880\nSo why'd you come to Charlotte?\n\n22:34.880 --> 22:35.880\nMy family brought me.\n\n22:35.880 --> 22:36.880\nOkay.\n\n22:36.880 --> 22:37.880\nSo it's like a kidnapping.\n\n22:37.880 --> 22:41.380\nYou could say that.\n\n22:41.380 --> 22:43.880\nHow old were you when your family brought you to Charlotte?\n\n22:43.880 --> 22:44.880\nA little.\n\n22:44.880 --> 22:45.880\nOkay.\n\n22:45.880 --> 22:46.880\nIs that Mike on, Katie?\n\n22:46.880 --> 22:47.880\nWhat?\n\n22:47.880 --> 22:48.880\nIs that Mike on?\n\n22:48.880 --> 22:49.880\nOr are you just very soft-spoken?\n\n22:49.880 --> 22:50.880\nIt might not be.\n\n22:50.880 --> 22:51.880\nCheck.\n\n22:51.880 --> 22:52.880\nCheck.\n\n22:52.880 --> 22:53.880\nIt is on.\n\n22:53.880 --> 22:54.880\nOkay.\n\n22:54.880 --> 22:55.880\nI'll speak louder.\n\n22:55.880 --> 22:56.880\nOkay.\n\n22:56.880 --> 22:57.880\nGreat.\n\n22:57.880 --> 22:59.880\nSo when you were two years old, your parents came from New Orleans to Charlotte?\n\n22:59.880 --> 23:00.880\nYes.\n\n23:00.880 --> 23:01.880\nWhy?\n\n23:01.880 --> 23:02.880\nBecause your dad's job, whatever?\n\n23:02.880 --> 23:03.880\nIt was what?\n\n23:03.880 --> 23:05.880\nDoes it have something to do with your dad's work?\n\n23:05.880 --> 23:09.880\nNo, I think we just had to get out, kind of thing.\n\n23:09.880 --> 23:12.880\nI think we had family here, so we had to come here.\n\n23:12.880 --> 23:13.880\nOkay.\n\n23:13.880 --> 23:14.880\nI was a child.\n\n23:14.880 --> 23:15.880\nIt wasn't explained to me.\n\n23:15.880 --> 23:17.880\nI would just put in the car and go.\n\n23:17.880 --> 23:18.880\nAll right.\n\n23:18.880 --> 23:19.880\nWell, let's...\n\n23:19.880 --> 23:20.880\nThat sounds like a good show.\n\n23:20.880 --> 23:21.880\nYeah.\n\n23:21.880 --> 23:22.880\nI'd watch that.\n\n23:22.880 --> 23:23.880\nLet me do it.\n\n23:23.880 --> 23:24.880\nIt's called Child Abduction.\n\n23:24.880 --> 23:25.880\nLet's brainstorm.\n\n23:25.880 --> 23:32.880\nTake a seat for a second, Katie, and let me just workshop like a first scene from a show\n\n23:32.880 --> 23:33.880\nabout your life.\n\n23:33.880 --> 23:34.880\nYeah.\n\n23:34.880 --> 23:35.880\nI'm making this up as I go.\n\n23:35.880 --> 23:36.880\nYeah.\n\n23:36.880 --> 23:37.880\nGo ahead.\n\n23:37.880 --> 23:38.880\nI'm sorry.\n\n23:38.880 --> 23:39.880\nNo, no.\n\n23:39.880 --> 23:40.880\nYou can keep the mic.\n\n23:40.880 --> 23:41.880\nIt's yours to keep.\n\n23:41.880 --> 23:44.880\nEverybody here gets to take something from the comedy club tonight.\n\n23:44.880 --> 23:45.880\nYeah.\n\n23:45.880 --> 23:46.880\nWe're giving everything away.\n\n23:46.880 --> 23:47.880\nYeah.\n\n23:47.880 --> 23:48.880\nYou all get to keep your chair.\n\n23:48.880 --> 23:52.880\nThere's like 500 empty chairs we're going to be giving away.\n\n23:52.880 --> 23:53.880\nYeah.\n\n23:53.880 --> 23:54.880\nEach of you gets 50.\n\n23:54.880 --> 23:56.880\nIt's a comedy zone chair giveaway night.\n\n23:56.880 --> 23:57.880\nAll right.\n\n23:57.880 --> 23:59.880\nJeff, you're a professional improviser.\n\n23:59.880 --> 24:02.880\nWould you do the first scene of the Katie pilot?\n\n24:02.880 --> 24:04.880\nIs this a cold open?\n\n24:04.880 --> 24:05.880\nYeah, yeah.\n\n24:05.880 --> 24:06.880\nOkay.\n\n24:06.880 --> 24:12.880\nKatie, your mother's dead.\n\n24:12.880 --> 24:13.880\nWe're leaving.\n\n24:13.880 --> 24:15.880\nDon't ask any questions.\n\n24:15.880 --> 24:17.880\nSmash cut to the car.\n\n24:17.880 --> 24:20.880\nKatie was born in New Orleans.\n\n24:20.880 --> 24:23.880\nNow she's on the run to Charlotte.\n\n24:23.880 --> 24:25.880\nShe doesn't know why.\n\n24:25.880 --> 24:28.880\nDad, where are we going?\n\n24:28.880 --> 24:30.880\nI got some terrible news for you.\n\n24:30.880 --> 24:32.880\nWe're both werewolves.\n\n24:32.880 --> 24:34.880\nBut I'm too.\n\n24:34.880 --> 24:35.880\nNo.\n\n24:35.880 --> 24:39.880\nNew Orleans was going to build the world's biggest moon.\n\n24:39.880 --> 24:41.880\nAnd we would be werewolves all the time.\n\n24:41.880 --> 24:42.880\nWe're going through it.\n\n24:42.880 --> 24:43.880\nWe have to move north.\n\n24:43.880 --> 24:46.880\nWe have to get away from the moon, honey.\n\n24:46.880 --> 24:50.880\nMeanwhile, at the New Orleans government anti-werewolf facility.\n\n24:50.880 --> 24:52.880\nDa, da, da.\n\n24:52.880 --> 24:53.880\nPshh.\n\n24:53.880 --> 24:54.880\nPshh.\n\n24:54.880 --> 24:55.880\nPshh.\n\n24:55.880 --> 24:56.880\nPshh.\n\n24:56.880 --> 24:59.880\nAgent Henderson reported for duty, sir.\n\n24:59.880 --> 25:01.880\nYou're late, Henderson.\n\n25:01.880 --> 25:05.880\nThat's because I go by the phases of the moon.\n\n25:05.880 --> 25:08.880\nThe scheme of yours to create a larger moon\n\n25:08.880 --> 25:10.880\nto out all of New Orleans' werewolves\n\n25:10.880 --> 25:12.880\nis going to cost us a pretty penny.\n\n25:12.880 --> 25:14.880\nSir, with all due respect.\n\n25:14.880 --> 25:17.880\nI want you off of this moon case.\n\n25:17.880 --> 25:21.880\nYou're dismissing me from this unit that I created?\n\n25:21.880 --> 25:24.880\nYou have exactly 12 episodes to catch Katie and her father\n\n25:24.880 --> 25:29.880\nbefore they make it to Charlotte and create a werewolf colony up there.\n\n25:29.880 --> 25:32.880\nThen I'm going to do it my own way.\n\n25:32.880 --> 25:33.880\nPshh.\n\n25:33.880 --> 25:36.880\nGil Gerard is agent Henderson.\n\n25:36.880 --> 25:37.880\nHenderson?\n\n25:37.880 --> 25:38.880\nYes.\n\n25:38.880 --> 25:40.880\nI don't like you, but I like your methods.\n\n25:40.880 --> 25:42.880\nActually, no, I don't like either of them.\n\n25:42.880 --> 25:43.880\nI don't like you or your methods.\n\n25:43.880 --> 25:46.880\nBut I like the fact that you sometimes get results.\n\n25:46.880 --> 25:48.880\nI want those werewolves back.\n\n25:48.880 --> 25:51.880\nWell, I'm going to get them and I'll show everybody\n\n25:51.880 --> 25:53.880\nin this whole government facility.\n\n25:53.880 --> 25:56.880\nI'm a man's man usually, but when it comes to these situations,\n\n25:56.880 --> 25:58.880\nI get a little cry baby-ish.\n\n25:58.880 --> 25:59.880\nPshh.\n\n25:59.880 --> 26:00.880\nWow.\n\n26:00.880 --> 26:03.880\nWhat a complicated, richly-developed character that was.\n\n26:03.880 --> 26:06.880\nYou have too many doors.\n\n26:06.880 --> 26:13.880\nMeanwhile, at a comfort suites just outside of Charlotte.\n\n26:13.880 --> 26:18.880\nHere in the news today, New Orleans had a gas leak.\n\n26:18.880 --> 26:20.880\nDad, it says New Orleans...\n\n26:20.880 --> 26:21.880\nOh, no!\n\n26:21.880 --> 26:24.880\nOh!\n\n26:24.880 --> 26:26.880\nRun!\n\n26:26.880 --> 26:28.880\nRun, Katie!\n\n26:28.880 --> 26:30.880\nThe moon is following us.\n\n26:30.880 --> 26:34.880\nI'll spite you in another episode.\n\n26:34.880 --> 26:38.880\nI got to tuck myself in a crib and tip it into a river.\n\n26:38.880 --> 26:39.880\nPshh.\n\n26:42.880 --> 26:44.880\nI got to get away from that moon.\n\n26:44.880 --> 26:47.880\nSay, little girl, what are you doing in a river at night all alone?\n\n26:47.880 --> 26:52.880\nOh, Italian gondolier.\n\n26:52.880 --> 26:55.880\nMy daddy got werewolved by the moon.\n\n26:55.880 --> 26:58.880\nThe Charlotte River's no place for a little lady like yourself.\n\n26:58.880 --> 27:00.880\nI don't know what to think no more.\n\n27:00.880 --> 27:05.880\nYou've got a strangely ethnically ambiguous mentor to deal with now.\n\n27:05.880 --> 27:10.880\nI'll show you how to survive the Charlotte wave.\n\n27:10.880 --> 27:12.880\nI got to tell you something, though.\n\n27:12.880 --> 27:13.880\nWhat's your name?\n\n27:13.880 --> 27:15.880\nSamantha.\n\n27:15.880 --> 27:19.880\nI got to tell you, Samantha, I'm a werewolf.\n\n27:19.880 --> 27:22.880\nOh, we don't judge around here.\n\n27:22.880 --> 27:25.880\nWe're not like those assholes in Atlanta.\n\n27:25.880 --> 27:30.880\nMontage of Katie learning to hone her werewolf abilities\n\n27:30.880 --> 27:33.880\nthrough Samantha's weird, multi-ethnic tutelage.\n\n27:33.880 --> 27:35.880\nRawr.\n\n27:35.880 --> 27:37.880\nRawr.\n\n27:37.880 --> 27:39.880\nRawr.\n\n27:39.880 --> 27:40.880\nRawr.\n\n27:40.880 --> 27:41.880\nRawr.\n\n27:41.880 --> 27:42.880\nRawr.\n\n27:42.880 --> 27:43.880\nRawr.\n\n27:43.880 --> 27:44.880\nRawr.\n\n27:44.880 --> 27:50.880\nOver the years, she crows from a toddler to a new biol adolescent.\n\n27:50.880 --> 27:54.880\nKatie, I don't have much longer to live.\n\n27:54.880 --> 27:59.880\nI feel that I did everything I could for you to turn you into a woman werewolf.\n\n27:59.880 --> 28:02.880\nBut I'm just getting sexy.\n\n28:02.880 --> 28:04.880\nI know, but I can't always be here for you.\n\n28:04.880 --> 28:09.880\nBut I will be involved in later episodes via voiceover.\n\n28:09.880 --> 28:12.880\nI guess that's cool.\n\n28:12.880 --> 28:15.880\nIt could use punch-up.\n\n28:15.880 --> 28:19.880\nWell, I'm going back to Charlotte.\n\n28:19.880 --> 28:21.880\nWait, no, I'm sorry.\n\n28:21.880 --> 28:23.880\nDid you hear that?\n\n28:23.880 --> 28:25.880\nRawr.\n\n28:25.880 --> 28:27.880\nNo!\n\n28:27.880 --> 28:30.880\nWerewolf hunting ninjas.\n\n28:30.880 --> 28:32.880\nI'm going back to New Orleans.\n\n28:32.880 --> 28:34.880\nAnd that's the end of the pilot.\n\n28:34.880 --> 28:36.880\nShe goes back to New Orleans.\n\n28:36.880 --> 28:37.880\nSo you went to Charlotte.\n\n28:37.880 --> 28:39.880\nThat's probably not how it worked, though, right?\n\n28:39.880 --> 28:41.880\nNo.\n\n28:41.880 --> 28:44.880\nYou say that wasn't an accurate depiction of your childhood?\n\n28:44.880 --> 28:46.880\nIt was close.\n\n28:46.880 --> 28:48.880\nYou are a werewolf?\n\n28:48.880 --> 28:51.880\nThat's none of your business.\n\n28:51.880 --> 28:52.880\nWow.\n\n28:52.880 --> 28:53.880\nAll right.\n\n28:53.880 --> 28:59.880\nWell, thank you, Katie, for helping us make that pilot.\n\n28:59.880 --> 29:04.880\nI still feel like we haven't really gotten you any work as a TV writer.\n\n29:04.880 --> 29:10.880\nIn my urgency to entertain the audience, I sort of forgot that goal.\n\n29:10.880 --> 29:14.880\nRight what you know?\n\n29:14.880 --> 29:16.880\nRight what you know?\n\n29:16.880 --> 29:17.880\nYeah.\n\n29:17.880 --> 29:19.880\nWhat do you know?\n\n29:19.880 --> 29:22.880\nObviously, I know werewolves and...\n\n29:22.880 --> 29:23.880\nI don't know.\n\n29:23.880 --> 29:24.880\nNo, I'm just trying to...\n\n29:24.880 --> 29:25.880\nIs that how you wrote community?\n\n29:25.880 --> 29:27.880\nBecause you went to community college for a while, right?\n\n29:27.880 --> 29:29.880\nWas that where that came from?\n\n29:29.880 --> 29:31.880\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n29:31.880 --> 29:36.880\nSo my next pilot is going to be about a guy that has no idea what he's doing,\n\n29:36.880 --> 29:41.880\nand just wanders around being sad, drinking a lot,\n\n29:41.880 --> 29:46.880\nand doing shows in concrete rooms.\n\n29:46.880 --> 29:47.880\nHey, what's that?\n\n29:47.880 --> 29:54.880\nOkay, so if this were a zombie attack, who would be our leader?\n\n29:54.880 --> 30:00.880\nEverybody point at somebody immediately, one, two, three, point.\n\n30:00.880 --> 30:02.880\nA lot of people point at the English guy.\n\n30:02.880 --> 30:05.880\nWell, the guys that came alone pointed at me.\n\n30:05.880 --> 30:08.880\nThen there's some people pointing at this guy in the front,\n\n30:08.880 --> 30:10.880\nand then there's this guy, I don't know.\n\n30:10.880 --> 30:12.880\nThis guy looks like he's pretty tough.\n\n30:12.880 --> 30:14.880\nHey, he's got tattoos, he's got a bald head.\n\n30:14.880 --> 30:15.880\nWhat's your name?\n\n30:15.880 --> 30:17.880\nWhat's your name?\n\n30:17.880 --> 30:18.880\nJohn.\n\n30:18.880 --> 30:22.880\nJohn, Senna, you big guy?\n\n30:22.880 --> 30:23.880\nYeah, he's the one.\n\n30:23.880 --> 30:24.880\nYeah.\n\n30:24.880 --> 30:27.880\nHe's got a little tattoo showing from underneath his sleeves.\n\n30:27.880 --> 30:30.880\nI think that speaks larger tattoos underneath that shirt.\n\n30:30.880 --> 30:34.880\nJohn, take your shirt off.\n\n30:34.880 --> 30:37.880\nBen, what do we got on the Constitution of Harmontown?\n\n30:37.880 --> 30:40.880\nYeah, read back what we have so far, Ben.\n\n30:40.880 --> 30:44.880\nIt's mostly interesting pitches for Katie's first TV show,\n\n30:44.880 --> 30:47.880\nand zombie emergency leadership protocols.\n\n30:47.880 --> 30:48.880\nOkay.\n\n30:48.880 --> 30:51.880\nBut also, people should be allowed to do whatever they want to do, right?\n\n30:51.880 --> 30:55.880\nYeah, everybody should, drunk and ramblings,\n\n30:55.880 --> 30:57.880\nnobody should do what they don't want to do.\n\n30:57.880 --> 30:58.880\nRight.\n\n30:58.880 --> 31:02.880\nAnd we're appalled by the state of this nation,\n\n31:02.880 --> 31:03.880\nwe're obliged to become criminals.\n\n31:03.880 --> 31:04.880\nAppalled?\n\n31:04.880 --> 31:05.880\nYes.\n\n31:05.880 --> 31:06.880\nOkay, good.\n\n31:06.880 --> 31:07.880\nAll right, we'll figure it out.\n\n31:07.880 --> 31:09.880\nWe'll narrow it down before we leave Charlotte.\n\n31:09.880 --> 31:10.880\nAnd terrorists.\n\n31:10.880 --> 31:12.880\nRight, terrorists, something about terrorists.\n\n31:12.880 --> 31:13.880\nAnd terrorists.\n\n31:13.880 --> 31:16.880\nWho's the most patriotic person in the audience?\n\n31:16.880 --> 31:17.880\nYou are?\n\n31:17.880 --> 31:19.880\nThe guy from Newcastle.\n\n31:19.880 --> 31:22.880\nYeah, are you patriotic about American citizenship\n\n31:22.880 --> 31:24.880\nor about your British heritage?\n\n31:24.880 --> 31:25.880\nIt's actually born here.\n\n31:25.880 --> 31:27.880\nSorry, I'm as American as you are.\n\n31:27.880 --> 31:31.880\nYou have such a pronounced Newcastle accent, though.\n\n31:31.880 --> 31:32.880\nYeah?\n\n31:32.880 --> 31:33.880\nYou're born here and you still...\n\n31:33.880 --> 31:35.880\nIs it your parents or what?\n\n31:35.880 --> 31:38.880\nWe moved to Newcastle when I was like six months old.\n\n31:38.880 --> 31:41.880\nAh, so you were born an American and you lived there?\n\n31:41.880 --> 31:42.880\nI got you.\n\n31:42.880 --> 31:43.880\nI see.\n\n31:43.880 --> 31:44.880\nKind of.\n\n31:44.880 --> 31:46.880\nI'm a charming vampire.\n\n31:46.880 --> 31:48.880\nWhat about you?\n\n31:48.880 --> 31:49.880\nAre you a patriot?\n\n31:49.880 --> 31:52.880\nCan you come up here for a second?\n\n31:52.880 --> 31:54.880\nWe don't bully anybody at Harmontown.\n\n31:54.880 --> 31:56.880\nHere, take Ben's mic.\n\n31:56.880 --> 31:59.880\nFuck that guy.\n\n31:59.880 --> 32:01.880\nI was actually talking to Ben before the show.\n\n32:01.880 --> 32:02.880\nWe went to high school together.\n\n32:02.880 --> 32:03.880\nNo.\n\n32:03.880 --> 32:04.880\nDidn't fucking know it.\n\n32:04.880 --> 32:05.880\nYou're kidding, really?\n\n32:05.880 --> 32:06.880\nNo.\n\n32:06.880 --> 32:07.880\nWhat high school?\n\n32:07.880 --> 32:08.880\nClover High School.\n\n32:08.880 --> 32:09.880\nClover High School.\n\n32:09.880 --> 32:10.880\nThe town with love in the middle.\n\n32:10.880 --> 32:12.880\nWhere the only culture is agriculture.\n\n32:12.880 --> 32:15.880\nWhat was the Clover High School football team?\n\n32:15.880 --> 32:17.880\nThe Blue Eels.\n\n32:17.880 --> 32:18.880\nThe Blue Eagles.\n\n32:18.880 --> 32:21.880\nWeird because they're out at their clovers.\n\n32:21.880 --> 32:23.880\nThe Eagle is what makes my patriotism.\n\n32:23.880 --> 32:25.880\nYou just have to go lateral and just go fuck it.\n\n32:25.880 --> 32:28.880\nWear worms or a thing because we can't be clovers.\n\n32:28.880 --> 32:30.880\nIt's too obvious.\n\n32:30.880 --> 32:33.880\nAll right, so you're a patriot.\n\n32:33.880 --> 32:34.880\nAre you like a conservative?\n\n32:34.880 --> 32:35.880\nWould you call yourself a right wing?\n\n32:35.880 --> 32:36.880\nFuck no.\n\n32:36.880 --> 32:39.880\nDon't be fooled because I look like Mitt Romney's son.\n\n32:39.880 --> 32:41.880\nAll right.\n\n32:41.880 --> 32:44.880\nSo you're liberal as probably a lot of Harmontown listeners,\n\n32:44.880 --> 32:46.880\nbut you're an America lover.\n\n32:46.880 --> 32:47.880\nYou love America.\n\n32:47.880 --> 32:48.880\nI do.\n\n32:48.880 --> 32:49.880\nYeah.\n\n32:49.880 --> 32:51.880\nWhy don't you marry it?\n\n32:51.880 --> 32:55.880\nBecause they don't allow gay marriages in North Carolina.\n\n32:55.880 --> 32:57.880\nAnd America's a dude.\n\n32:57.880 --> 32:59.880\nWe know that for sure.\n\n32:59.880 --> 33:06.880\nBecause it's got Florida hanging down.\n\n33:06.880 --> 33:08.880\nAll right, so you're a patriot.\n\n33:08.880 --> 33:13.880\nSo how can you help refine my constitution?\n\n33:13.880 --> 33:14.880\nAmend it.\n\n33:14.880 --> 33:17.880\nOkay, if two people want to do whatever they want to do\n\n33:17.880 --> 33:22.880\nand it interferes, if I want to smoke a cigarette\n\n33:22.880 --> 33:24.880\nand you don't want to breathe my second-hand smoke,\n\n33:24.880 --> 33:26.880\nhow do we resolve this?\n\n33:26.880 --> 33:28.880\nI keep going back to Lord of the Flies.\n\n33:28.880 --> 33:29.880\nI mean, you shouldn't just be like,\n\n33:29.880 --> 33:31.880\nsuck your ass more, Piggy.\n\n33:31.880 --> 33:33.880\nWe got to figure something out so we don't end up\n\n33:33.880 --> 33:34.880\nlike Lord of the Flies.\n\n33:34.880 --> 33:36.880\nI mean, do you want the conch?\n\n33:36.880 --> 33:37.880\nShould we pass that around?\n\n33:37.880 --> 33:38.880\nWell, I've had the conch.\n\n33:38.880 --> 33:41.880\nI'm trying to pass it around, yeah.\n\n33:41.880 --> 33:44.880\nI mean, the problem is human courtesy\n\n33:44.880 --> 33:45.880\nhas just gone out the window, so...\n\n33:45.880 --> 33:46.880\nRight.\n\n33:46.880 --> 33:48.880\nWe don't think that people are important anymore.\n\n33:48.880 --> 33:49.880\nAm I right?\n\n33:49.880 --> 33:50.880\nWhat's your name?\n\n33:50.880 --> 33:51.880\nDid I get your name?\n\n33:51.880 --> 33:52.880\nNo, Nathan.\n\n33:52.880 --> 33:53.880\nNathan, okay.\n\n33:53.880 --> 33:55.880\nHuman courtesy has gone out the window.\n\n33:55.880 --> 33:58.880\nWe're not starting with the idea\n\n33:58.880 --> 34:00.880\nthat people are the most important thing.\n\n34:00.880 --> 34:03.880\nI do it too.\n\n34:03.880 --> 34:05.880\nIf there's dudes sitting on the street,\n\n34:05.880 --> 34:06.880\nyou step over them.\n\n34:06.880 --> 34:08.880\nYou've got shit to do.\n\n34:08.880 --> 34:10.880\nI'm not going to be the first guy to stop\n\n34:10.880 --> 34:12.880\nand go like, okay, I'm not going to work today.\n\n34:12.880 --> 34:13.880\nLike, hey, get up.\n\n34:13.880 --> 34:15.880\nLet's get you some soup.\n\n34:15.880 --> 34:16.880\nThen I'm going to get fired,\n\n34:16.880 --> 34:18.880\nand I'll be laying next to him,\n\n34:18.880 --> 34:20.880\nand then everyone's afraid of that happening.\n\n34:20.880 --> 34:23.880\nSo we have to form a new society where you go,\n\n34:23.880 --> 34:26.880\nokay, there's a guy laying in the street.\n\n34:26.880 --> 34:27.880\nEveryone stop.\n\n34:27.880 --> 34:28.880\nStop it.\n\n34:28.880 --> 34:30.880\nEveryone stop what they're doing.\n\n34:30.880 --> 34:31.880\nBut in order to do that,\n\n34:31.880 --> 34:33.880\nyou have to kind of like extract yourself\n\n34:33.880 --> 34:36.880\nfrom this machine that we've got going on, right?\n\n34:36.880 --> 34:38.880\nIt's not a question, I guess.\n\n34:38.880 --> 34:40.880\nIt should be a people first thing,\n\n34:40.880 --> 34:41.880\nbut we don't care about that,\n\n34:41.880 --> 34:42.880\nbecause we just don't.\n\n34:42.880 --> 34:44.880\nAnd it's not how we got where we are.\n\n34:44.880 --> 34:46.880\nI mean, we built a country\n\n34:46.880 --> 34:50.880\non largely unpaid physical labor.\n\n34:50.880 --> 34:52.880\nWe couldn't afford to care about people.\n\n34:52.880 --> 34:54.880\nWe took over the world by like\n\n34:54.880 --> 34:56.880\nnot giving a shit about people.\n\n34:56.880 --> 34:58.880\nSo we can't stand here on stage\n\n34:58.880 --> 35:00.880\nas a big fat, rich asshole\n\n35:00.880 --> 35:03.880\nand say, let's start caring about each other.\n\n35:03.880 --> 35:05.880\nIt's kind of hypocritical, isn't it?\n\n35:05.880 --> 35:06.880\nYeah.\n\n35:06.880 --> 35:08.880\nSo what the fuck am I talking about?\n\n35:08.880 --> 35:09.880\nI don't know.\n\n35:09.880 --> 35:10.880\nI mean...\n\n35:10.880 --> 35:12.880\nHow do we punish me for my insolence?\n\n35:12.880 --> 35:13.880\nI'm an asshole.\n\n35:13.880 --> 35:15.880\nI'm an idiot.\n\n35:15.880 --> 35:17.880\nYou really are too hard on yourself, man.\n\n35:17.880 --> 35:19.880\nOkay, well, how do we punish me for that?\n\n35:19.880 --> 35:21.880\nWe shouldn't punish you.\n\n35:21.880 --> 35:23.880\nI think when we punish you, that's the problem.\n\n35:23.880 --> 35:24.880\nWe can't punish you.\n\n35:24.880 --> 35:26.880\nI mean, we just need to...\n\n35:26.880 --> 35:27.880\nI don't know.\n\n35:27.880 --> 35:28.880\nHug it out.\n\n35:28.880 --> 35:29.880\nHug it out, yeah.\n\n35:29.880 --> 35:30.880\nI mean, connect you.\n\n35:30.880 --> 35:32.880\nI think you're pretty well connected.\n\n35:32.880 --> 35:34.880\nI mean, you're one of the more generous people.\n\n35:34.880 --> 35:37.880\nLike, you have the courtesy to respond to your fans\n\n35:37.880 --> 35:39.880\nvia Twitter and Reddit and all that shit.\n\n35:39.880 --> 35:40.880\nI do give a lot.\n\n35:40.880 --> 35:41.880\nI give a lot.\n\n35:48.880 --> 35:50.880\nI give a lot\n\n35:53.880 --> 35:55.880\nto you.\n\n35:57.880 --> 35:59.880\nYou're welcome.\n\n35:59.880 --> 36:02.880\nYou

it.\n\n36:19.880 --> 36:22.880\nBut I get caught up\n\n36:22.880 --> 36:24.880\nin\n\n36:24.880 --> 36:26.880\nsongwriting.\n\n36:26.880 --> 36:28.880\nGood.\n\n36:28.880 --> 36:30.880\nOkay, that's a good song.\n\n36:30.880 --> 36:32.880\nYou really do give a lot.\n\n36:32.880 --> 36:33.880\nYeah.\n\n36:33.880 --> 36:35.880\nNo, please.\n\n36:35.880 --> 36:39.880\nLet me give you the right to not applaud that.\n\n36:39.880 --> 36:41.880\nI'm very generous.\n\n36:41.880 --> 36:43.880\nI'm a very generous person.\n\n36:43.880 --> 36:45.880\nRap break!\n\n36:45.880 --> 36:47.880\nOh,

seeing if this would make me\n\n37:55.880 --> 37:56.880\nextra powerful.\n\n37:59.880 --> 38:02.880\nBen, tell us a story about\n\n38:02.880 --> 38:04.880\nsomebody pooping their pants in your class\n\n38:04.880 --> 38:05.880\nor something.\n\n38:05.880 --> 38:07.880\nLike, what's the weirdest thing that happened\n\n38:07.880 --> 38:09.880\nwhen you were substitute teaching a class?\n\n38:09.880 --> 38:11.880\nWeirdest thing.\n\n38:13.880 --> 38:14.880\nJust a random story.\n\n38:14.880 --> 38:17.880\nSome girl puked in her purse.\n\n38:18.880 --> 38:20.880\nSome kid took a crap.\n\n38:20.880 --> 38:21.880\nI can tell you something that happened\n\n38:21.880 --> 38:23.880\nat one of the schools I do substitute at.\n\n38:23.880 --> 38:26.880\nAt the school, me and Nathan both went to high school at.\n\n38:26.880 --> 38:28.880\nClover High School.\n\n38:28.880 --> 38:30.880\nAccording to Coach Roach,\n\n38:30.880 --> 38:34.880\nbecause we can't hire actual social studies teachers.\n\n38:34.880 --> 38:35.880\nWait, Coach Roach?\n\n38:35.880 --> 38:36.880\nCoach Roach.\n\n38:36.880 --> 38:37.880\nThat's awesome.\n\n38:37.880 --> 38:41.880\nYeah, we live in South Carolina.\n\n38:41.880 --> 38:45.880\nWe can't afford to hire actual social studies,\n\n38:45.880 --> 38:49.880\nscience teachers, per se.\n\n38:49.880 --> 38:51.880\nSo we hire athletic coaches\n\n38:51.880 --> 38:53.880\nto cover the social studies\n\n38:53.880 --> 38:55.880\nand most of the cultural stuff.\n\n38:55.880 --> 38:59.880\nCoach Roach taught a certain slant\n\n38:59.880 --> 39:01.880\non American history.\n\n39:05.880 --> 39:09.880\nAccording to him, he was teaching a class.\n\n39:09.880 --> 39:11.880\nHe was standardized testing.\n\n39:12.880 --> 39:15.880\nApparently, one of the female students\n\n39:15.880 --> 39:19.880\nsat through the entire test\n\n39:19.880 --> 39:21.880\nand then asked to be let out.\n\n39:22.880 --> 39:24.880\nHe said, yeah, fine, if you're done.\n\n39:24.880 --> 39:25.880\nAnd she said she was done.\n\n39:25.880 --> 39:26.880\nSo she started to go.\n\n39:26.880 --> 39:28.880\nAnd she was moving very carefully,\n\n39:28.880 --> 39:33.880\njust kind of shuffling her feet one together.\n\n39:33.880 --> 39:36.880\nAnd she was almost to the door.\n\n39:36.880 --> 39:37.880\nShe had almost made it.\n\n39:37.880 --> 39:44.880\nShe was almost home safe when a turd falls right about there,\n\n39:44.880 --> 39:45.880\nright behind her.\n\n39:45.880 --> 39:47.880\nHe's pointing at the stage.\n\n39:47.880 --> 39:50.880\nIt falls right about there.\n\n39:52.880 --> 39:53.880\nThat's it.\n\n39:53.880 --> 39:56.880\nThat's the story I wanted.\n\n39:56.880 --> 39:58.880\nThe story about a turd falling down your pants.\n\n39:58.880 --> 40:02.880\nI thought that Coach Roach wasn't the bad guy in the story.\n\n40:02.880 --> 40:04.880\nThat was going in a very different direction.\n\n40:04.880 --> 40:05.880\nYeah, I thought.\n\n40:05.880 --> 40:07.880\nHe taught a very specific type of history.\n\n40:07.880 --> 40:09.880\nDid he teach turd history?\n\n40:09.880 --> 40:12.880\nDid he?\n\n40:12.880 --> 40:14.880\nWas he just really a racist?\n\n40:14.880 --> 40:17.880\nWell, Clover High School is the kind of high school\n\n40:17.880 --> 40:22.880\nwhere you learned that FDR deliberately kept the fleet\n\n40:22.880 --> 40:25.880\nin Pearl Harbor so that the Japanese would bomb it\n\n40:25.880 --> 40:27.880\nso that we could go into World War II.\n\n40:27.880 --> 40:28.880\nWow.\n\n40:28.880 --> 40:29.880\nAgain, South Carolina.\n\n40:29.880 --> 40:31.880\nSouth Carolina.\n\n40:31.880 --> 40:35.880\nOh yeah, because it was so different.\n\n40:35.880 --> 40:39.880\nDid you know, Jeff, that North Carolina did not secede\n\n40:39.880 --> 40:41.880\nfrom the Union until we were in Tennessee\n\n40:41.880 --> 40:44.880\nand we were talking about how Tennessee was supposed to.\n\n40:44.880 --> 40:47.880\nThere was some contention there of who was the last,\n\n40:47.880 --> 40:49.880\nwhich was the last state, because it happened\n\n40:49.880 --> 40:50.880\nlike within days of each other.\n\n40:50.880 --> 40:53.880\nBut what we do know is that North Carolina did not leave\n\n40:53.880 --> 40:58.880\nthe Union until Abraham Lincoln asked them to attack South Carolina.\n\n40:58.880 --> 41:01.880\nThat's got to be an awkward situation.\n\n41:01.880 --> 41:03.880\nI guess that would be a deal breaker for me too\n\n41:03.880 --> 41:06.880\nif there had been a North and South Wisconsin.\n\n41:06.880 --> 41:09.880\nI would have not wanted to.\n\n41:09.880 --> 41:11.880\nDo we have any racists in the audience?\n\n41:11.880 --> 41:15.880\nIs there anybody racist?\n\n41:15.880 --> 41:17.880\nIt would be weird if there was somebody that was like,\n\n41:17.880 --> 41:20.880\nI'm racist and came up and wanted to talk about it.\n\n41:20.880 --> 41:22.880\nI don't know how we'd handle that,\n\n41:22.880 --> 41:26.880\nbut we've been having a complicated time of things.\n\n41:26.880 --> 41:29.880\nWe're these Yankee doodles, whatever you call us,\n\n41:29.880 --> 41:31.880\nand we're coming through the South.\n\n41:31.880 --> 41:35.880\nObviously, you guys are going to tend to be progressive,\n\n41:35.880 --> 41:37.880\nlike liberal.\n\n41:37.880 --> 41:40.880\nIt's not like my crowd is the tractor pull\n\n41:40.880 --> 41:42.880\nand a crowd necessarily.\n\n41:42.880 --> 41:46.880\nNothing against anybody that wants to pull a tractor anywhere.\n\n41:46.880 --> 41:48.880\nI'm not saying that at all.\n\n41:48.880 --> 41:49.880\nI'm not an elitist.\n\n41:49.880 --> 41:50.880\nYou don't pull a tractor.\n\n41:50.880 --> 41:52.880\nTractors pull things.\n\n41:52.880 --> 41:53.880\nWell, they call them tractor pulls.\n\n41:53.880 --> 41:58.880\nGet your shit together.\n\n41:58.880 --> 42:02.880\nIt's weird when we start talking about the racial stuff\n\n42:02.880 --> 42:04.880\nand the history of stuff.\n\n42:04.880 --> 42:06.880\nThere's this swirl of weird...\n\n42:06.880 --> 42:09.880\nIt's difficult to talk about down here,\n\n42:09.880 --> 42:15.880\nbecause people feel a compulsion to compensate for the history\n\n42:15.880 --> 42:17.880\nand say, well, we're not...\n\n42:17.880 --> 42:19.880\nThat's not who we are anymore.\n\n42:19.880 --> 42:22.880\nIt's like, I don't know what my point is.\n\n42:22.880 --> 42:24.880\nI don't have one.\n\n42:24.880 --> 42:26.880\nMy point is I don't have a point.\n\n42:26.880 --> 42:28.880\nHe killed himself down here.\n\n42:28.880 --> 42:30.880\nThis is where Hitler died.\n\n42:30.880 --> 42:33.880\nHe just got tired of being Hitler.\n\n42:33.880 --> 42:37.880\nHe wrote his final diary entry.\n\n42:37.880 --> 42:41.880\nDear diary, still Hitler.\n\n42:41.880 --> 42:44.880\nI can hear the war ending above me.\n\n42:44.880 --> 42:48.880\nNot much use for old Hitler anymore.\n\n42:48.880 --> 42:51.880\nGuess I'll just tuck it in.\n\n42:51.880 --> 42:55.880\nIs it true that he tried the poison on his dog first?\n\n42:55.880 --> 42:58.880\nYeah, he had a dog and he had the cyanide capsule\n\n42:58.880 --> 43:01.880\nand he gave it to his dog to make sure it was the real McCoy.\n\n43:01.880 --> 43:04.880\nHe killed old Blondie first before he had it.\n\n43:04.880 --> 43:06.880\nHis dog's name was Blondie.\n\n43:06.880 --> 43:09.880\nDo you think his dog had a little dog mustache?\n\n43:09.880 --> 43:13.880\nDo you think Hitler's car had a little mustache on it?\n\n43:13.880 --> 43:15.880\nDo you think his pencils and things?\n\n43:15.880 --> 43:18.880\nHe did give the world one lasting gift, though.\n\n43:18.880 --> 43:20.880\nBecause of that funny mustache,\n\n43:20.880 --> 43:22.880\nanytime anybody hates the current president,\n\n43:22.880 --> 43:25.880\nall you got to do is drop it on the front on George Bush\n\n43:25.880 --> 43:28.880\nor on Obama and you've really made your point.\n\n43:28.880 --> 43:32.880\nYeah, Obama, Hitler.\n\n43:32.880 --> 43:34.880\nObama.\n\n43:34.880 --> 43:37.880\nI got a few things to rap about him.\n\n43:46.880 --> 43:48.880\nYo, Obama's rap.\n\n43:48.880 --> 43:52.880\nHey, Obama, I fucked your mama. That's it.\n\n43:55.880 --> 43:56.880\nThank you.\n\n43:56.880 --> 43:57.880\nWow.\n\n43:57.880 --> 43:59.880\nThank you, Charlotte.\n\n44:01.880 --> 44:04.880\nThat was biting social commentary.\n\n44:04.880 --> 44:08.880\nI invite the American government to come down here\n\n44:08.880 --> 44:12.880\nand seize this bunker if they don't like what they're hearing.\n\n44:12.880 --> 44:15.880\nWe'll be well out of here.\n\n44:15.880 --> 44:19.880\nRob Schneider will be doing his act in this.\n\n44:19.880 --> 44:22.880\nSwat teams will come in.\n\n44:22.880 --> 44:24.880\nI'll haul him off to Guantanamo.\n\n44:24.880 --> 44:27.880\nRight now, you could edit together a version of what we've done so far\n\n44:27.880 --> 44:29.880\nand make a case that you're a bad, bad guy.\n\n44:29.880 --> 44:31.880\nBad citizen, for sure.\n\n44:31.880 --> 44:33.880\nYou hate the government. You want to be a terrorist.\n\n44:33.880 --> 44:35.880\nYou try to fuck the president's mama.\n\n44:35.880 --> 44:38.880\nI don't want to be a terrorist. I don't want to blow anything up.\n\n44:38.880 --> 44:40.880\nThat's bad.\n\n44:40.880 --> 44:43.880\nI feel like I'm protesting too much.\n\n44:43.880 --> 44:45.880\nI don't think you should ever have to see that.\n\n44:45.880 --> 44:48.880\nI don't want to blow anything up.\n\n44:48.880 --> 44:50.880\nI did a pipe bomb when I was a kid.\n\n44:50.880 --> 44:51.880\nYeah.\n\n44:51.880 --> 44:52.880\nAre you two?\n\n44:52.880 --> 44:53.880\nYeah.\n\n44:53.880 --> 44:55.880\nOh, yeah.\n\n44:55.880 --> 44:57.880\nYou got too proud of that night.\n\n44:57.880 --> 45:01.880\nI used to like, my friend Matt Gorley is on the Super Ego podcast.\n\n45:01.880 --> 45:03.880\nWe were friends in the junior high school.\n\n45:03.880 --> 45:08.880\nHe had replica guns, like actual working, looking, fired blanks,\n\n45:08.880 --> 45:11.880\nlike Luger's and Walther's and stuff like that.\n\n45:11.880 --> 45:14.880\nWe'd go, we'd walk into the Whitwood Mall in Whittier, California\n\n45:14.880 --> 45:16.880\nwith guns in our belts.\n\n45:16.880 --> 45:18.880\nThey really looked like the real thing\n\n45:18.880 --> 45:21.880\nbecause they basically were without the firing pin was gone or something like that.\n\n45:21.880 --> 45:23.880\nAnd we'd make bombs and stuff like that.\n\n45:23.880 --> 45:25.880\nWe were terrible people.\n\n45:25.880 --> 45:27.880\nWe would be doing a lot of time now.\n\n45:27.880 --> 45:30.880\nActually, detectives came to our school\n\n45:30.880 --> 45:34.880\nand a plainclothes detective pulled me out for a bomb threat\n\n45:34.880 --> 45:38.880\nbecause I drew some girl that was a junior park in senior parking.\n\n45:38.880 --> 45:42.880\nSo Matt and I drew a picture of her car exploding and a soccer ball flying out\n\n45:42.880 --> 45:44.880\nbecause she played soccer.\n\n45:44.880 --> 45:47.880\nAnd the fucking LAPD, like the detectives came\n\n45:47.880 --> 45:49.880\nbecause it's a terrorist threat.\n\n45:49.880 --> 45:54.880\nI remember my friend Dan Ramstack and I made a...\n\n45:54.880 --> 45:55.880\nRamstack?\n\n45:55.880 --> 45:58.880\nWe figured out how to make lights blink with batteries\n\n45:58.880 --> 46:00.880\nand we took electrical tape and like wrapped it around\n\n46:00.880 --> 46:03.880\nand we made this thing that had like blinking lights on them\n\n46:03.880 --> 46:07.880\nand we taped it to our neighbor's front screen door\n\n46:07.880 --> 46:09.880\nand it just ran away.\n\n46:09.880 --> 46:11.880\nAnd I don't know what we were thinking.\n\n46:11.880 --> 46:12.880\nI don't think we thought...\n\n46:12.880 --> 46:14.880\nWe weren't trying to say this is a bomb.\n\n46:14.880 --> 46:17.880\nWe thought maybe they would think it was like a robot or something.\n\n46:17.880 --> 46:19.880\nBut the fucking bomb squad showed up\n\n46:19.880 --> 46:21.880\nbecause Google...\n\n46:21.880 --> 46:23.880\nI had a crush on the girl.\n\n46:23.880 --> 46:25.880\nThis is how I expressed it.\n\n46:25.880 --> 46:27.880\nBut he showed up and looked at it\n\n46:27.880 --> 46:29.880\nand went like, okay, all right, 9-1-1.\n\n46:29.880 --> 46:32.880\nAnd then there were just guys in white pajamas running around\n\n46:32.880 --> 46:35.880\ndiffusing this Christmas light.\n\n46:35.880 --> 46:38.880\nThat was before 9-11, Jeff. Everything changed on 9-11.\n\n46:38.880 --> 46:40.880\nI don't know if you guys knew that.\n\n46:40.880 --> 46:43.880\nEverything changed on 9-11.\n\n46:43.880 --> 46:45.880\nRight, Ben?\n\n46:45.880 --> 46:47.880\nSo they kept telling me when I worked for that place.\n\n46:47.880 --> 46:49.880\nAnd then they downsized you.\n\n46:49.880 --> 46:50.880\nYes.\n\n46:50.880 --> 46:53.880\nNow you're teaching kids how to roll turds out of their pants.\n\n46:53.880 --> 46:56.880\nYou used to be America's first line of defense\n\n46:56.880 --> 46:59.880\nagainst more 9-11s happening.\n\n46:59.880 --> 47:03.880\nAgainst chiefly 18- and 19-year-olds from Damascus, apparently.\n\n47:03.880 --> 47:04.880\nRight.\n\n47:04.880 --> 47:06.880\nSee, I used to give...\n\n47:06.880 --> 47:08.880\nMe and my friends were terrible people.\n\n47:08.880 --> 47:10.880\nWe used to give substitute teachers a lot of shit.\n\n47:10.880 --> 47:12.880\nBut you seem like a pretty intimidating guy.\n\n47:12.880 --> 47:14.880\nI don't know if I would mess with you.\n\n47:14.880 --> 47:18.880\nThe way it usually goes is they come in\n\n47:18.880 --> 47:21.880\nand they're being little shits because they're teenagers, right?\n\n47:21.880 --> 47:27.880\nAnd then it takes one good excuse me.\n\n47:27.880 --> 47:29.880\nCan you give us an example?\n\n47:29.880 --> 47:31.880\nThat wasn't an example, right?\n\n47:31.880 --> 47:33.880\nNo, that was not an example. Really?\n\n47:33.880 --> 47:34.880\nBecause a kid...\n\n47:34.880 --> 47:36.880\nCan you make this to your chalkboard here\n\n47:36.880 --> 47:39.880\nand I'll be in the back of the

would get some kind of wisdom on how to get out of here.\n\n53:26.880 --> 53:29.760\nI'm always with you, Katie.\n\n53:29.760 --> 53:32.800\nI quit my job at the coffee place.\n\n53:32.800 -->

you think it is.\n\n54:05.080 --> 54:07.880\nThink it is.\n\n54:07.880 --> 54:11.000\nRhymes with stink-a-mizz.\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.760\nThe company that makes this bolt on the ceiling.\n\n54:13.760 --> 54:17.040\nA hatch opens.\n\n54:17.040 --> 54:18.560\nThat was easy.\n\n54:18.560 --> 54:21.480\nTime to kick-box my way to the end of the episode.\n\n54:21.480 --> 54:34.920\nI know there'll be more like you in episodes two through twelve.\n\n54:34.920 --> 54:39.400\nIt's in the way that you use it.\n\n54:39.400 --> 54:41.400\nBack to the school.\n\n54:41.400

what?\n\n54:48.880 --> 54:52.600\nI heard you went to jail, probably for being a werewolf.\n\n54:52.600 --> 54:56.000\nMaybe I learned it's worth sticking things out and fighting for what I believe in.\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:58.000\nCan I ask you a question?\n\n54:58.000 --> 54:59.000\nYeah.\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.280\nIt's kind of personal, though.\n\n55:01.280 --> 55:02.280\nI'm 13.\n\n55:02.280 --> 55:03.280\nI can take it.\n\n55:03.280 --> 55:11.280\nI just want to know, when the moon comes out, like, are you hairy everywhere?\n\n55:11.280 --> 55:15.280\nDick Wolf, free-spray.\n\n55:15.280

writer.\n\n55:26.040 --> 55:29.280\nIs there a reason why werewolves have metal shidnguards?\n\n55:29.280 --> 55:31.280\nI don't know.\n\n55:31.280 --> 55:33.280\nI don't know, man.\n\n55:33.280 --> 55:35.280\nIs that a vulnerable part of a werewolf?\n\n55:35.280 --> 55:37.280\nAsk yourself that.\n\n55:37.280 --> 55:39.280\nLet's bring Spencer up, our Dungeon Master.\n\n55:39.280 --> 55:41.280\nOh, shit, yeah.\n\n55:41.280 --> 55:47.280\nWe're going to have to say goodbye to Ben for a moment so Spencer can take his place.\n\n55:47.280 --> 55:49.280\nYeah, Ben's been using the Spencer table.\n\n55:49.280 --> 55:50.280\nAll right, Spencer, our Dungeon Master.\n\n55:50.280 --> 55:54.280\nFor those of you who don't know, we play D&D on this show, and Spencer has traveled

56:04.280\nRight?\n\n56:04.280 --> 56:07.280\nSpencer, what do you think of how the show's been going?\n\n56:07.280 --> 56:09.280\nIt's been really good.\n\n56:09.280 --> 56:10.280\nI've been laughing.\n\n56:10.280 --> 56:11.280\nCan you hear me back there?\n\n56:11.280 --> 56:13.280\nYou don't think it's a little weird?\n\n56:13.280 --> 56:14.280\nI like weird?\n\n56:14.280 --> 56:15.280\nOh, OK.\n\n56:15.280 --> 56:16.280\nThat makes sense.\n\n56:16.280 --> 56:18.280\nSpencer's toes are fused together.\n\n56:18.280 --> 56:19.280\nWe found out.\n\n56:19.280 --> 56:22.280\nAnd you can go on Instagram and you can see a picture of his toes.\n\n56:22.280 --> 56:23.280\nHe has a thing.\n\n56:23.280 --> 56:24.280\nDo you...\n\n56:24.280 --> 56:25.280\nYes,

--> 57:42.920\nwe have is that we're better than South Carolina.\n\n57:42.920 --> 57:44.640\nIs there anyone from South Carolina here?\n\n57:44.640 --> 57:45.640\nOh, Jesus.\n\n57:45.640 --> 57:46.640\nHoly shit.\n\n57:46.640 --> 57:51.040\nDude, he's surrounded by South Carolinans.\n\n57:51.040 --> 58:03.800\nI'm going to go out and- Okay, you've got this whole table of South Carolina.\n\n58:03.800 --> 58:04.800\nAll right.\n\n58:04.800 --> 58:06.680\nWhat do you have to say in South Carolina's defense over here?\n\n58:06.680 --> 58:08.560\nSouth Carolina's a shit.\n\n58:08.560 --> 58:14.640\nNow, it's hard to argue with that.\n\n58:14.640 --> 58:15.640\nYeah.\n\n58:15.640 --> 58:21.240\nYou guys, you can't be proud that you're 50th in education, probably, right?\n\n58:21.240 --> 58:24.240\nNo, but our education system is broken anyway, so.\n\n58:24.240 --> 58:25.240\nYeah.\n\n58:25.240 --> 58:33.320\nBob Jones University, which is like a conservative Christian university there in South Carolina.\n\n58:33.320 --> 58:38.000\nActually, even Jeff, when Christians talk about making South Carolina a homeland and\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:41.360\nsucceeding from the Union once again, it's a messed up place.\n\n58:41.360 --> 58:42.360\nAll right.\n\n58:42.360 --> 58:45.160\nJeff, we have a serious human conflict here.\n\n58:45.160 --> 58:49.240\nOn the night that I decided we have to figure out a new way to resolve human conflict.\n\n58:49.240 --> 58:50.240\nYou know what?\n\n58:50.240 --> 58:54.120\nI'm going to be the representative for South Carolina, and I'm going to-\n\n58:54.120 --> 58:55.280\nThat's not very brave of you.\n\n58:55.280 --> 58:56.280\nYou're surrounded by-\n\n58:56.280 --> 58:57.280\nYeah.\n\n58:57.280 --> 59:03.080\nDan, Dan, I got to tell you, it's the shit.\n\n59:03.080 --> 59:08.840\nBut Abraham Lincoln wanted North Carolina to attack South Carolina, and the Carolinas\n\n59:08.840 --> 59:11.120\npulled together and said, look, we're both Carolinas.\n\n59:11.120 --> 59:13.240\nIt seems like a logical thing.\n\n59:13.240 --> 59:18.040\nNow there's all this division again, just because of a simple direction on a compass.\n\n59:18.040 --> 59:19.040\nYeah.\n\n59:19.040 --> 59:22.560\nHow do you guys feel about Virginia, or do you guys care about that, or is it just because\n\n59:22.560 --> 59:23.560\nyou share a name?\n\n59:23.560 --> 59:25.040\nHenry, how do you feel about Virginia?\n\n59:25.040 --> 59:27.360\nI think Virginia is slightly better than North Carolina.\n\n59:27.360 --> 59:28.360\nOh, really?\n\n59:28.360 --> 59:29.360\nYeah.\n\n59:29.360 --> 59:30.360\nWait, better than North?\n\n59:30.360 --> 59:31.360\nYeah.\n\n59:31.360 --> 59:33.360\nOh, so you're self-loathing, Carolina.\n\n59:33.360 --> 59:34.360\nOkay.\n\n59:34.360 --> 59:35.360\nWell, we can't-\n\n59:35.360 --> 59:40.640\nIt's not that you love North Carolina so much, it's just that it is just a little bit better\n\n59:40.640 --> 59:41.640\nthan South Carolina.\n\n59:41.640 --> 59:42.640\nIt's our little thing.\n\n59:42.640 --> 59:43.640\nIt could be worse.\n\n59:43.640 --> 59:49.160\nYou just want to hop on our tour bus and come smoke weed in California, and be liberal\n\n59:49.160 --> 59:50.160\nand cosmopolitan.\n\n59:50.160 --> 59:51.160\nI understand that.\n\n59:51.160 --> 59:56.160\nWell, you probably, yeah, you probably grow it a lot here, right?\n\n59:56.160 --> 59:58.160\nYeah, something in the back.\n\n59:58.160 --> 59:59.680\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.\n\n59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.680\nLook, this is a-\n\n01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:05.040\nWe're not talking about your exact right about a simple direction of North Carolina and South\n\n01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.040\nCarolina.\n\n01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.560\nThere is a plot that we can't do.\n\n01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:09.560\nOkay, okay.\n\n01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.360\nJeff, I'm handing her the mic.\n\n01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.360\nOkay.\n\n01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:18.680\nI'm Adrienne, and I'm from North Carolina, and there's a lot to be proud of for North\n\n01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:19.680\nCarolina.\n\n01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.120\nWe have a ton of awesome things here.\n\n01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.640\nEverybody loves North Carolina.\n\n01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.120\nSouth Carolina has awesome things.\n\n01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.120\nWhat are you guys proud of?\n\n01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.120\nIt's just a-\n\n01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.120\nHuh?\n\n01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.120\nEverything.\n\n01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.200\nI mean, we have great people.\n\n01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.960\nNorth Carolina has, no, not just NASCAR.\n\n01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.640\nThat's everything that people pick on.\n\n01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.680\nDon't you guys have like peanut butter pie here?\n\n01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.680\nIs that a thing here?\n\n01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:41.680\nWe're not just-\n\n01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.680\nYeah.\n\n01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.680\nYeah, there we go.\n\n01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.680\nThat's pretty good.\n\n01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:45.680\nPeople don't just have-\n\n01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.680\nI like what you've been saying about getting people together.\n\n01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:48.680\nWell, I'm a-\n\n01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:49.680\nHey, how are you?\n\n01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.680\nI forgot your name already.\n\n01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.680\nI'm Adrienne.\n\n01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.680\nNice to meet you.\n\n01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.680\nIt's nice to meet you.\n\n01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.680\nNice to meet you.\n\n01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.680\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.680\nAdrienne.\n\n01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.680\nAdrienne, all right.\n\n01:00:57.680 -->

Schneider was going to be here?\n\n01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.680\nBruh, no.\n\n01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.680\nYou're way better.\n\n01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:10.320\nSo, I'm excited to be here, and

my fault.\n\n01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.320\nThat's my fault.\n\n01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.320\nNo, but you're an awesome guy.\n\n01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.320\nWe appreciate you

01:03:54.520\nDo you work here, Adrienne?\n\n01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:55.520\nNo, I just came out.\n\n01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.520\nBecause it's cold.\n\n01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:57.520\nThat's a laugh.\n\n01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.520\nOh, it won't.\n\n01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.520\nYeah.\n\n01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.520\nYou know, Dan, actually, it's weird.\n\n01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:07.520\nAdrienne actually died 15 years ago.\n\n01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.520\nThat's her ghost?\n\n01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.520\nYeah.\n\n01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:13.520\nShe had snakes for hair.\n\n01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.520\nThat's a ghost story.\n\n01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.520\nThe comedy zone is haunted by the most positive ghost in the world.\n\n01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:22.520\nIt makes sense, because Hitler died here.\n\n01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:29.520\nSo, of course, it would be haunted by a very happy lady.\n\n01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.520\nSo the Hitler's bunker is haunted by a Jewish ghost.\n\n01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.520\nHappy Jew.\n\n01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:34.520\nHappy Jew.\n\n01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.520\nHey.\n\n01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.520\nIt could be worse.\n\n01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:41.520\nThat's Hitler's purgatory, is he has to walk around his death bunker.\n\n01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.520\nAnd Adrienne is just like, hey, hug it out.\n\n01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.520\nHug it out, Hitler.\n\n01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.520\nHitler, have a sandwich.\n\n01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:46.520\nCome on, Hitler.\n\n01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.520\nWould you eat something?\n\n01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.520\nI forgive you, Hitler.\n\n01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.520\nHey, let the bygones be the bygones.\n\n01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:56.520\nAnd Hitler's like, this is a way to live your life.\n\n01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.520\nThis is a place to die.\n\n01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.520\nWe went to the Anne Frank Museum in, what do you call it, Amsterdam?\n\n01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.520\nThat was some heavy shit.\n\n01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.520\nMe and Aaron, I don't know.\n\n01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.520\nI'm done with that conversation.\n\n01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.520\nBut it was weird.\n\n01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.520\nYou know, you can't help when you're somewhere that serious.\n\n01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.520\nIs the house still there?\n\n01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.520\nDo you get to go up into the attic and stuff?\n\n01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:21.520\nYeah, but everything is reinforced with stainless steel to keep everyone from farting on something\n\n01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.520\nimportant.\n\n01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:32.520\nAnd her dad demanded out of deference to, because once the Frank family got turned in,\n\n01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.520\nthe Nazis came there and they cleared all the shit out.\n\n01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:40.520\nAnd her dad said, don't ever furnish it as a museum.\n\n01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:43.520\nAll the rooms should be empty as a symbolic thing.\n\n01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.520\nSo you're really just, I mean, good for him.\n\n01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:50.520\nI'm certainly not going to tell him how to run an Anne Frank Museum.\n\n01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:53.520\nBut the customer is always right.\n\n01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.520\nA little boring.\n\n01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.520\nCould use a couple sofas.\n\n01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:05.520\nYou really are just walking through and reading stuff in the wall that you could probably Google.\n\n01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:09.520\nYou could Google a lot of it.\n\n01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.520\nThey should call it the pre-Google Memorial Museum.\n\n01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:20.520\nI think they literally went on Google, printed the stuff, put it in a plexiglass frame,\n\n01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:25.520\nhung it on the wall, you walk through, look at the stuff that they Googled.\n\n01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.520\nFuck you, Anne Frank Museum.\n\n01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.520\nSorry.\n\n01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.520\nThat's a bold stance, man.\n\n01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.520\nSomeone's got to take it.\n\n01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.520\nIt sounds like you really suffered.\n\n01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:39.520\nSpeaking of suffering, I think it's time to play a little D&D.\n\n01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.520\nHow do you guys feel?\n\n01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520\nLet's do it.\n\n01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.520\nWhat are you guys going for?\n\n01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:46.520\nWe're going to need Aaron up here, though.\n\n01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:50.520\nErin McGathy to the stage, please. Erin McGathy.\n\n01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:54.520\nI wish we had a mic.\n\n01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:58.520\nI don't know that idea, because we have a mic pointed at the audience,\n\n01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.520\nand it's right in front of your face.\n\n01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.520\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.520\nDrew.\n\n01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.520\nDrew, would you take this mic and, like, we never do this for D&D.\n\n01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:13.520\nSound effects for anything, like if they say a horse gallops up,\n\n01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.520\nlike you might do.\n\n01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:18.520\nYou can come up and share my mic, Drew.\n\n01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:22.520\nIf you're in Amsterdam, still check out the Anne Frank Museum.\n\n01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:25.520\nIt's pretty moving.\n\n01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.520\nThe explanation for the furniture not being there was that so many people were lost,\n\n01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.520\nso there can't be anything in the building.\n\n01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.520\nIt was a little silly.\n\n01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:37.520\nThere must have been something else that was going on there.\n\n01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.520\nNo, no, I'm not.\n\n01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.520\nI know.\n\n01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:45.520\nI would hate for anyone here to be in Amsterdam to be like,\n\n01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.520\nwell, Dan Harmon said to not go to the museum.\n\n01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.520\nGo, still go.\n\n01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.520\nIs there a gift shop there?\n\n01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.520\nThere is, yeah.\n\n01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.520\nWhat's for sale, like a t-shirt?\n\n01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.520\nHer hair, all of her hair.\n\n01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:02.520\nI know, different copies of the book.\n\n01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.520\nI bought a bunch of postcards.\n\n01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:07.520\nI was really moved. I was the only one in our party that was super into it.\n\n01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:10.520\nThere's beautiful, like little shampoo bottles shaped like Anne Frank.\n\n01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.520\nThey're flashlights and blankets for hiding.\n\n01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.520\nSee, when you connect the dots, that's when they boo.\n\n01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.520\nAll right, Spencer, get us up to date.\n\n01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.520\nAll right.\n\n01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:31.520\nWhen we last met, our group had just split up.\n\n01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.520\nMulraine flamed the scene to meditate at the sacred grove.\n\n01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.520\nQuark thrown onto the back of a deadly Candroid.\n\n01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:43.520\nAnd Sharpie left to clean up the dead after the great battle of Buttsalot Camp.\n\n01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.520\nQuark infiltrated the great black ship of Dark Star's fleet,\n\n01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:51.520\nchecking out various rooms while Sharpie had the moment he'd always desired with his father.\n\n01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:55.520\nReaching a new understanding, his father bestowed upon Sharpie the greatest gift of all.\n\n01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.520\nHis magic cloak, the symbol of leadership of the Buttsalot Drive.\n\n01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.520\nI'm sorry, can you pause there? I keep thinking about Adrienne in the back,\n\n01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.520\nnot knowing what the fuck's going on.\n\n01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.520\nNow I can't stop thinking about her point of view.\n\n01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:12.520\nShe just came in and we're playing Dungeons & Dragons in front of her.\n\n01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:15.520\nI'm almost certain that she's going to be good with it then.\n\n01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.520\nAdrienne, are you on board?\n\n01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.520\nI was told by the staff that she's the Adam Goldberg of this place.\n\n01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.520\nHe becomes every chef.\n\n01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.520\nAdrienne, we're playing a make-believe game where...\n\n01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.520\nI'm worried about what you said about fucking my mama from the distance.\n\n01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.520\nShe's the easiest and now I'm going to be embarrassed.\n\n01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.520\nOh no, we'll edit out where I fucked your mama.\n\n01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.520\nHe's not really going to fuck your mama.\n\n01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:47.520\nNo, she's worried her mama will hear it and she'll...\n\n01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.520\nShe's cute. I mean, don't...\n\n01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.520\nOh, then I'll fuck her.\n\n01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.520\nWe'll all fuck her.\n\n01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.520\nOkay, now we're going to fuck your mama.\n\n01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.520\nNow it's for real.\n\n01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.520\nI don't discriminate on mamas.\n\n01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.520\nAlright.\n\n01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.520\nOkay, Adrienne, Adrienne?\n\n01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.520\nAlright, here we go.\n\n01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:17.520\nNo, I was concerned about her not having an eye into the...\n\n01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.520\nAlright, sorry, Spencer, continue.\n\n01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.520\nJust making sure.\n\n01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:24.520\nMeanwhile, deep in meditation, Mulraine was disturbed by the sounds of a troubled horse.\n\n01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:28.520\nInspecting further, he discovered a dead woman wearing a belt of gender switching,\n\n01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.520\nas well as a tight-up horse.\n\n01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:34.520\nMulraine put it on and regained her original, feminine form.\n\n01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.520\nSwiftly, she rode, rejoining Sharpie at Yellow Camp,\n\n01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.520\nand together, with the magic of his father's cape, the two teleported,\n\n01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.520\nrejoining Quark in the hold of the Black Ship,\n\n01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.520\njust in time to hear the loud claxons of a warning alarm going off.\n\n01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:50.520\nShit was about to go down.\n\n01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.520\nGo!\n\n01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.520\nI was in a blackout drunk.\n\n01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.520\nYou put your magic cloak on, and you joined me on the ship.\n\n01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.520\nI'd been kicking some ass and killing some dudes with some cannons.\n\n01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.520\nYellow creatures and some black creatures.\n\n01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:11.520\nRight, and I intimidated a black creature, and it was pretty cool.\n\n01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:17.520\nAnd then you guys teleported up to join me on the mother ship, presumably of Admiral Darkstar.\n\n01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.520\nBoth of us?\n\n01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.520\nYeah, you're both together. You were that fucked up?\n\n01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.520\nI was that fucked up, dude.\n\n01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.520\nYou know I'm a woman now.\n\n01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:28.520\nI mean, you guys have no idea. This show is ten times better than Nashville.\n\n01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:33.520\nThey were having a better time, it sounded like, because they were fucked up, too.\n\n01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.520\nYou hear, like, oh, we're laughing, we're having a good time, but I'm telling you, I sound like a maniac.\n\n01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:45.520\nThat's why I came in here low-key and was like, you know, I wanted to, like, I wanted to mellow it out a little bit.\n\n01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.520\nWell, you've certainly done that.\n\n01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.520\nBut then we ended up kickboxing with werewolves.\n\n01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.520\nYeah, that's true.\n\n01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:54.520\nAlright, so I examine the surrounding Spencer.\n\n01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:57.520\nYou're in a long room. Behind you stands a row of cannons.\n\n01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:03.520\nTheir position is fixed, but the housing they're mounted on looks like it can be swung around 360 degrees.\n\n01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.520\nThe alarm blares, and you know it's only a matter of time before someone comes to check it out.\n\n01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:14.520\nThe remaining yellow demon is sliding across the floor towards a large yellow grate in the far wall.\n\n01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.520\nTurtle what?\n\n01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.520\nA grate in the far wall. The door in front of you remains closed.\n\n01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.520\nCould I take the cannon and swivel it around and shoot the door?\n\n01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:24.520\nOh, totally.\n\n01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:29.520\nAlright, I swivel the cannon. Stand back, everybody! I'm gonna blow the door open!\n\n01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.520\nThat's true, everybody.\n\n01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.520\nThis is great.\n\n01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.520\nThe door blasts open with a loud explosion.\n\n01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.520\nYou see the main room.\n\n01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.520\nThis room is covered in pipes, tubes, metal gauges, and all manner of valves and knobs.\n\n01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:51.520\nAside from the door you just came through, you see doors on your left and on your right,\n\n01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:54.520\nand a large open hatch on the floor before you.\n\n01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:57.520\nIf you remember, Quark, that's how you got into this room.\n\n01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.520\nAlright, so I'm back where I came in.\n\n01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:59.520\nYeah.\n\n01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.520\nGot it.\n\n01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.520\nAnd so there's the two doors that I did not go through the first time.\n\n01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:07.520\nThe door to your right has a large sign in a language you can't read.\n\n01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:10.520\nDoes anybody here have a power to read languages?\n\n01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.520\nCan you tell us more about that language? Like, what does it look like?\n\n01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.520\nI'll tell you it's a Bissell, and you recognize it as a Bissell.\n\n01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.520\nLike, so I can...\n\n01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:18.520\nYou speak a Bissell.\n\n01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:19.520\nI do?\n\n01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.520\nYeah.\n\n01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.520\nWell, what does it say?\n\n01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.520\nUh, what does it say?\n\n01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.520\nBridge.\n\n01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.520\nOoh.\n\n01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.520\nIt says bridge. It's written in a Bissell.\n\n01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:33.520\nI say we go to the bridge and take this mother down.\n\n01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.520\nYeah, let's do it.\n\n01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.520\nThe door seems to be locked.\n\n01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.520\nSorry, I just did a quick walkie-talkie check.\n\n01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.520\nSwitch the channel through, you guys.\n\n01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:53.520\nThe corridor that we're in is lined with doors on either side.\n\n01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.520\nThere's another door that, besides the one I mentioned,\n\n01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:59.520\nand there's a hatch in the floor that would go down a floor.\n\n01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.520\nRight, I try to open the other door.\n\n01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.520\nThe metal door opens with a whoosh,\n\n01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.520\nand you can see a large pool of yellowy, liquid flesh swirling around.\n\n01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.520\nWhat is this?\n\n01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.520\nOccasionally, you see a face contorted in agony,\n\n01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.520\ndrift up to the surface,\n\n01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.520\nbefore giving a heart-sreaking wail\n\n01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.520\nand sinking down to the bottom of the fluid.\n\n01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.520\nThis looks like a party we don't want to join, gentlemen.\n\n01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.520\nYou see several buttons on the far wall.\n\n01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.520\nThere's a grate on the floor, on the left side of the room,\n\n01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.520\nand a small door to your right.\n\n01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.520\nSo there's a big puddle, a yellow flesh goo,\n\n01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.520\nand a face occasionally is bubbling around in it?\n\n01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.520\nYep.\n\n01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.520\nAnd there are buttons, and there's a grate.\n\n01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.520\nYou see a coalescing figure.\n\n01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.520\nIt's one of those yellow demons that rises out of the mush\n\n01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.520\nand slides past it across the door.\n\n01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:52.520\nIt doesn't seem to be giving you any notice.\n\n01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.520\nCreature!\n\n01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.520\nName yourself!\n\n01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:00.520\nIt doesn't seem to give you any notice.\n\n01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.520\nWhat is it doing?\n\n01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.520\nIt just slid out of the room.\n\n01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.520\nOh, he's left?\n\n01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:07.520\nYep.\n\n01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.520\nThat was easy.\n\n01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.520\nDid the buttons say anything?\n\n01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:15.520\nThe buttons aren't labeled.\n\n01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:16.520\nThere's five of them.\n\n01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.520\nAre they different colors?\n\n01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.520\nThey are not.\n\n01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.520\nWhat color are they?\n\n01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.520\nThey're gray.\n\n01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.520\nOkay.\n\n01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.520\nAnd there's a door to your right.\n\n01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.520\nCan I cast knock on it?\n\n01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:34.520\nIsn't that like a spell that opens locked doors?\n\n01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.520\nYeah, knock is a spell that'll unlock any...\n\n01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.520\nany locker, you know.\n\n01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.520\nYeah, I see.\n\n01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:42.520\nIf it's not magical.\n\n01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:45.520\nYou cast it, right?\n\n01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.520\nYeah, it casts knock like the dickens.\n\n01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:48.520\nThe door blasts open.\n\n01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.520\nThis hall is empty.\n\n01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.520\nThe human...\n\n01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:56.520\nThe human standing in front of a door down the hall.\n\n01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:59.520\nAt the sound of the knock spell, he takes notice of you.\n\n01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.520\nThe man is almost naked, wearing only an orange wrap around his waist\n\n01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.520\nand holding a wicked looking metal whip.\n\n01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:08.520\nHe seems to be guarding something.\n\n01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:11.520\nHe cracks his whip with menace.\n\n01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.520\nDrew is killing it.\n\n01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.520\nSo this guy looks like a bad guy, probably, right?\n\n01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.520\nCombat is happening.\n\n01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.520\nCombat is happening.\n\n01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.520\nWhose turn is it?\n\n01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.520\nThe first person to react, I suppose.\n\n01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.520\nI react with a power attack.\n\n01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:33.520\nCharging through the door, you leap towards the foe with a power attack.\n\n01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.520\nOne, two, or three?\n\n01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:36.520\nTwo.\n\n01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.520\nTwo.\n\n01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.520\nYou hit!\n\n01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:45.520\nStriking the arm, holding the whip.\n\n01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.520\nYou're fl...\n\n01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.520\nFuck.\n\n01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.520\nYour sword cuts into his arm.\n\n01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.520\nThe man is almost felled.\n\n01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:58.520\nHe responds by snapping his whip at you.\n\n01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.520\nIt's a critical hit.\n\n01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:05.520\nThanks, Drew.\n\n01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:11.520\nYou take 18 damage and pull to your feet.\n\n01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:13.520\nFuckin' hell.\n\n01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.520\nSo I'm down

map.\n\n01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:46.520\nTake the keys.\n\n01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:49.520\nI pick up the keys and try to...\n\n01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.520\nNice.\n\n01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:56.520\nI jingle them around it just because I lock my Prius.\n\n01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:01.520\nAnd I go to try to open the lockers with the keys.\n\n01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.520\nYou unlock all the lockers.\n\n01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:04.520\nWhat do you get?\n\n01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:05.520\nA loot of charming.\n\n01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.520\nI'll take it.\n\n01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.520\nA power bracelet.\n\n01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.520\nEight good arrows.\n\n01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:11.520\nEight sleep arrows.\n\n01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.520\nTwenty V arrows.\n\n01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:14.520\nA chime of opening.\n\n01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:16.520\nFour beads of force.\n\n01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:20.520\nAnd a quadringe and a pair of teeth.\n\n01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.520\nMay I have the arrows, gentlemen?\n\n01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:24.520\nOf course.\n\n01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.520\nYeah, go ahead.\n\n01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.520\nThank you.\n\n01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.520\nThank you.\n\n01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.520\nLet me just pick these up slowly.\n\n01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.520\nArrow sound.\n\n01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:35.520\nWhat was that?\n\n01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.520\nCharm of opening?\n\n01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:37.520\nWhat was that?\n\n01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.520\nThe chime of opening.\n\n01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:39.520\nChime of opening?\n\n01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:42.520\nIt's a small metal tube.\n\n01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.520\nRight.\n\n01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:47.520\nIs this like a dick joke?\n\n01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.520\nNo.\n\n01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.520\nI should have went there.\n\n01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.520\nIt's just a small metal tube that opens things?\n\n01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.520\nOkay.\n\n01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.520\nThere's a little tag tied to it.\n\n01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:56.520\nA little tag?\n\n01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:57.520\nTo use.\n\n01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.520\nRing this chime.\n\n01:21:58.520 --> 01:21:59.520\nOh.\n\n01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.520\nOkay.\n\n01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.520\nIt's a chime of opening.\n\n01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.520\nOkay.\n\n01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:04.520\nAll right.\n\n01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.520\nIt probably works like my knock spell, right?\n\n01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:07.520\nI don't know.\n\n01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.520\nAll right.\n\n01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:14.520\nSo we gather up all that booty and we probably take these maps.\n\n01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.520\nAre there other doorways in this room?\n\n01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:20.520\nYou see a hatch in the ceiling and there's no ladder leading up to it.\n\n01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:24.520\nHowever, a silver staff lies in the corner of the room.\n\n01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:28.520\nI approach the staff and grab the staff.\n\n01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:32.520\nGrabbing the staff, you hold the staff.\n\n01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:43.520\nHolding the staff, I use it to pivot my beautiful woman body up to the hatch.\n\n01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:49.520\nAs you strike this bottom of the rod against the floor, it begins to grow in length.\n\n01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.520\nSoon, the rod is at the top of the hatch.\n\n01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.520\nNow, this is a dick joke, right?\n\n01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.520\nYeah, it is.\n\n01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.520\nI have the weirdest boner.\n\n01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:03.520\nI stroke the staff to thank it.\n\n01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:08.520\nIt pulses?\n\n01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.520\nSo can we climb that staff now to get up to the hatch?\n\n01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:13.520\nYou get the sense it would be easy to climb such a staff.\n\n01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:14.520\nAll right.\n\n01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:15.520\nI climb the staff.\n\n01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.520\nWe all climb the staff.\n\n01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.520\nYou all?\n\n01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.520\nYes, Adrienne.\n\n01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.520\nOh, shit.\n\n01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.520\nIt's all right.\n\n01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.520\nAdrienne's got a question.\n\n01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:23.520\nOkay.\n\n01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:26.520\nI have a question.\n\n01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.520\nI just got sleepy.\n\n01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:31.520\nIt's kind of hot in here.\n\n01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:34.520\nDo you want to talk about something else?\n\n01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:43.520\nAdrienne just gave a justifiable critique of how the evening's going.\n\n01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.520\nAdrienne, what do you do?\n\n01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.520\nWhat do you do, Adrienne?\n\n01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.520\nLet's not talk about you.\n\n01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.520\nThat's not fair.\n\n01:23:51.520 --> 01:24:00.520\nIf you're bored with us, I want to see you present something.\n\n01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:04.520\nYou just stretch out, Adrienne, do your thing.\n\n01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:09.520\nI don't want to be a bitch, but I don't care how Adrienne feels.\n\n01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:16.520\nI care how everyone else feels.\n\n01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:19.520\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.520\nI mean, but it is rude.\n\n01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.520\nIt's okay.\n\n01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.520\nI'm sure you're a sweetheart.\n\n01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.520\nMaybe you're a little drunk, but it is a little rude.\n\n01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.520\nIt's okay.\n\n01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.520\nYou're pretty.\n\n01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.520\nJust fucking bury your prettiness and other things.\n\n01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.520\nThis is going wild.\n\n01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.520\nHitler died in this room.\n\n01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.520\nIt's fine.\n\n01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:37.520\nI mean, I come up here and I just flounder and flounder.\n\n01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.520\nI don't care about you disrespecting me.\n\n01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:41.520\nI care about you disrespecting everybody else.\n\n01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.520\nOkay.\n\n01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.520\nWell, then just stop fucking talking.\n\n01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.520\nFine.\n\n01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.520\nYou're going to be fine.\n\n01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.520\nShe's fine.\n\n01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:48.520\nShe's going to be fine.\n\n01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:49.520\nI adore you.\n\n01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:50.520\nYou're going to be fine.\n\n01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.520\nJust stop talking.\n\n01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.520\nDo I have to make the sound effects?\n\n01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:54.520\nYes.\n\n01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.520\nYes.\n\n01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.520\nDrew wants to know if they fight, should you make the sound effect?\n\n01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:00.520\nAdrienne, we're climbing a magical staff into a different room.\n\n01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:05.520\nWhich sounds very boring, but it's happening.\n\n01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:10.520\nI'm so happy I'm here.\n\n01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:16.520\nThe American citizen guy with a completely foreign accent just expressed his total happiness\n\n01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:17.520\nwith being here.\n\n01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:18.520\nWhat's your name again, sir?\n\n01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.520\nClayton.\n\n01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:20.520\nClayton?\n\n01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.520\nYeah.\n\n01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:22.520\nIt's even a foreign name.\n\n01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.520\nSo British, or Australian, or...\n\n01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.520\nApparently, too.\n\n01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:26.520\nIs it Southern?\n\n01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:27.520\nYeah.\n\n01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:28.520\nWhere is Newcastle?\n\n01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:29.520\nI still don't...\n\n01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.520\nIs it Northern?\n\n01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:31.520\nNo.\n\n01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.520\nYou don't know?\n\n01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.520\nI'm not good at geography.\n\n01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:34.520\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:35.520\nThere's coal there, I think, right?\n\n01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.520\nIt's, yeah.\n\n01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:37.520\nYeah.\n\n01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:38.520\nYeah, beer and a soccer team.\n\n01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:39.520\nAll right.\n\n01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.520\nWe take a little break.\n\n01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.520\nLet's wrap this adventure up with that.\n\n01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.520\nOkay, so we'll leave that as a cliffhanger.\n\n01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.520\nThank you very much.\n\n01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.520\nOkay.\n\n01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:46.520\nDrew.\n\n01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:47.520\nThank you, everybody.\n\n01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.520\nDrew.\n\n01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.520\nAndrew.\n\n01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:54.520\nHitler's ghost, or the ghost of the Hans Hitler, Adrian, back there.\n\n01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:56.520\nThank you, Drew, on sound effects.\n\n01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:57.520\nThank you, yeah.\n\n01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.520\nThank you, Spencer.\n\n01:25:58.520 --> 01:25:59.520\nThank you, Erin McGathy.\n\n01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.520\nI'm really looking for the bad.\n\n01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.520\nThank you.\n\n01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:02.520\nThank you.\n\n01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:03.520\nA very angry Erin McGathy all of a sudden.\n\n01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.520\nI really...\n\n01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.520\nI'm trying to get the voice down.\n\n01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:07.520\nNice.\n\n01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:08.520\nT-shirt.\n\n01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:11.520\nTwo for 25.\n\n01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.640\nShe has some support from some parts of the room.\n\n01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:16.640\nThere's a Carolina conflict in here.\n\n01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.640\nIt's like, you know, when we grow up close to each other, we rub elbows.\n\n01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:25.640\nThe people that are closest to each other, Jeff, they can really hurt each other the\n\n01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:26.640\nmost.\n\n01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.640\nYeah.\n\n01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:30.640\nThat's what we learned in North Carolina tonight.\n\n01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.640\nI forced it, but it's a lesson.\n\n01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:37.640\nNow I think it's time for the...\n\n01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.640\nIt's time to find the best singers in the audience.\n\n01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:41.640\nShe can sing.\n\n01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:42.640\nYeah?\n\n01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:43.640\nYeah.\n\n01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:44.640\nWhat's up?\n\n01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:45.640\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:46.640\nI'm a tough guy.\n\n01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:47.640\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:59.640\nYou don't have to sing well because you were the only...\n\n01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.640\nYeah, we really had to pull teeth to get...\n\n01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.640\nYeah, so you're in the clear.\n\n01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:04.640\nYou're fine.\n\n01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:05.640\nAwesome.\n\n01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:09.640\nHave you been listening to the podcast as we've been on the road?\n\n01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:10.640\nI haven't, but I don't know the song.\n\n01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:11.640\nOh, okay.\n\n01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:12.640\nAll right.\n\n01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:13.640\nIt's really good, I think.\n\n01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:14.640\nPlease.\n\n01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:15.640\nIs there a melody?\n\n01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.640\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:17.640\nIt's like...\n\n01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:24.640\nCome on down to Harmontown Turn that frown upside down\n\n01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:30.640\nPea is yellow, poop is brown Come on down to Harmontown\n\n01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:31.640\nI think you got it.\n\n01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:32.640\nSomething like that, right?\n\n01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:33.640\nYeah.\n\n01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:34.640\nAll right.\n\n01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:35.640\nI'll help you out with the first one.\n\n01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:37.640\nAnd if anyone else knows it out there, please join it.\n\n01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:38.640\nAll right.\n\n01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:39.640\nWho knows it, right?\n\n01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:40.640\nAll right.\n\n01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:41.640\nClayton, you know it, right?\n\n01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:42.640\nYeah.\n\n01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:43.640\nYeah.\n\n01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:44.640\nYeah.\n\n01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:45.640\nYeah.\n\n01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:46.640\nYeah.\n\n01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:47.640\nYeah.\n\n01:27:47.640
