WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
There.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Charlotte, North Carolina.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
Welcome.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Harmontown is now officially in session everybody.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Oh yeah.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
What is this? Day 5?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Day 6? I have no idea.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
We've been on tour and it feels like we're members of the Donner party. It's wild.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
I woke up and Spencer was gnawing on my leg.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
Please welcome the mayor of Harmontown to the stage, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Everybody calm down. Calm down.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Sorry. No, it's okay. I didn't mean to yell at you.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Well, tonight's going to be a very interesting night. I promise you that.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
Last night in Nashville, the episode was only just being uploaded.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I almost hope none of you heard it.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
Control was lost. Things broke down. The audience was fantastic. They were wonderful.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
My drinking was unforgivable.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
The audience was loaded in and nice and early to escape the cold.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
We did Jagger bombs with them in the back.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
I took the stage already pretty sloshy.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
We went up to the stage pretty tipsy.

01:30.000 --> 01:44.000
Then about 20 minutes into it, we had a representative self-proclaimed hillbilly come up and treat us to moonshine out of a jar.

01:44.000 --> 01:52.000
Then I took a sip and then everything else was sort of a blackout until I listened to the recording today.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
I was editing it. I'll tell you this. I'll confide in you, Charlotte, because I'm relying on you to be a confidant tonight.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
We're going to have a quiet, dignified, thoughtful, mature show.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
I want to start with this confession to you.

02:05.000 --> 02:12.000
As an editor of Harmontown, I have never made more shame-based edits to a Harmontown recording.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
Usually, if there's any editing of a Harmontown recording, what you're hearing is I'll just lift, like, you know, I'll go,

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
hey, welcome to Harmontown.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
And some lady in the back will go, how is Zuckie Dick?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
And I'll go, what did you say?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
And the mic won't pick her up.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
She said she wants a Zuckie Dick, Jeff.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
And then it'll be kind of a weird, like, we'll bring her up here.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
And then you'll hear kind of like a burp, burp, burp, burp.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Okay, take that mic.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
I'll lift that stuff.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
So we'll just cut, you know, we'll just, a nice tight, I want a Zuckie Dick.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Hey, what's your name?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Nancy?

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
I'll just lift things to keep the podcast listener happy.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
But this morning in the hotel room as I was listening to the Nashville show, I was editing things because it was like,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
I sound like a monster.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
I don't want anyone or their mother to hear it.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
There were some very long raps and very long songs that...

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
I don't know if any of you are Beach Boys fans, but Brian Wilson had a period following that raps.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Post Kokomo.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
Where if you were hearing the words Brian Wilson, it was because he was just popping up at some venue and just sort of like,

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
just kind of Gary Busey-ing all over the place.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
I became Gary Busey last night. It was uncomfortable.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
There was a documentary crew there to film it, so when this movie comes out for $5 online,

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
I'm sure you can watch me make an ass of myself. I'm sure that'll be what the movie's about.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
But that's why I decided that tonight is going to be...

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
I picked this spot because for you podcast listeners, the comedy zone here in Charlotte is...

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
it couldn't be a better place to have an undersold show.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
It's sort of a concrete construction.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
I think Hitler killed himself here.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
We're in a day of the dead bunker.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
We are absolutely safe from anything that might happen outside.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I don't think cell phones work down here.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
There's a lot of concrete around us.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
We're in our parents' basement. It's time to make stained glass and get hit with belts.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
And get to know each other.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
And I respect you guys, and I'm coming to you on my knees.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Please forgive me for what happened in Nashville.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Please let me find a new home here in Charlotte.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
Please let's get to know each other in an intelligent, sophisticated, mature way, Jeff.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
I want to have a decent show, a show you could bring your parents to a little bit.

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
And I think one of the serious things that we have to talk about is this Harmontown government that we're forming.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
I think it's time to cross the threshold, Jeff, of actually getting serious about this.

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
Because we're going to colonize the moon or we're not. In any case, I think it's time for Harmontown and its followers to say,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
this is who we are, this is what we believe.

05:04.000 --> 05:12.000
Let's separate ourselves from the United States and everything else and just become a criminal organization.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
What if I don't believe in government? What if I don't like government?

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
Well, you shouldn't. Government's bad. Government's somebody telling somebody else what to do.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
I don't agree with that. That's what the United States is founded on, the principle that people telling people what to do is a bad idea.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Then somehow we got all caught up in doing it again.

05:29.000 --> 05:37.000
Some people that defend it, they have to reduce themselves to weird mental riddles by going like,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
oh, you don't believe that? Well, what if someone was stepping out of baby's head?

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
Well, I'm not in favor of stepping out of baby's head. You got me.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
Well, then you should vote for so-and-so, because otherwise the baby's head doesn't step down.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
That's silly. You're stepping on a theoretical baby's head. You're bullying me.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Everyone should be allowed to do whatever they want to do, right?

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
We all agree with that. Everyone should be allowed to do whatever they want to do.

06:02.000 --> 06:11.000
Then there's this problem that we run up against where what if me wanting to do whatever I want to do interferes with someone else wanting to do whatever they want to do.

06:11.000 --> 06:20.000
A tiny example, I want to smoke in this room. I want to light up a cigarette, because that's what I want to do.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
Then there's a bunch of people going, I don't want to inhale your secondhand smoke.

06:25.000 --> 06:36.000
A very classic example. There's got to be a way, Jeff, to create a rule, a system of thinking, where we could walk through that scenario

06:36.000 --> 06:45.000
in the same way, apply it to a serial killer. We don't have to have 8,000 laws.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
There's got to be a way, Jeff, to create a little logarithm.

06:50.000 --> 06:57.000
I think it's a thing called courtesy. Self-awareness. Awareness of your surroundings and awareness of the needs and desires of other people.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
That's something that people don't have enough of. People just don't consider other people.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
Do we have anybody here tonight that has sort of a, well, okay, this might be embarrassing.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
I understand you don't want to participate in this.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Raise your hand if you came alone. Okay.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
The whole audience?

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
There's a whole table for the people that came alone.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
So you guys just got sat together because you're, okay.

07:20.000 --> 07:27.000
All right, so all of you guys came alone. Everyone look at them. They all came alone.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
But they're not leaving alone.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
No, they're not. You're all getting laid tonight.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
We're going to do a square dance at the end of the show.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Remember square dancing?

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
No, I'm from Southern California. That's not a thing.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Did you guys do square dancing in your Phi Ed classes?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Yes.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Okay, yeah.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
It was a weird thing where they took everybody and forced them to touch each other.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
It was always so that people like me could make physical contact with girls

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
and with sweaty, gross hands would touch theirs.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Dosey dough and promenade.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
You're just being forced to touch people that would never touch you.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
I had fancy square dancing. We had Catillion.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Did anybody have that?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah, it's really, yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Catillion was weird.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
There was a lady and she had castanets for some reason.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
That's how she got your attention.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Everybody!

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
That was our thing.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
All right, who's having the worst time tonight?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Okay, good.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
We just started.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
They're all having a really bad time.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
All right, one of you guys that came here alone,

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
I need you to be like the secretary for tonight,

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
because we're going to make a system of laws.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I actually have a parent paper.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Okay, all right.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Your name's Ben, right? We met you before the show.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Ben, could you come up here and introduce yourself to the audience?

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Ben's kind of an interesting guy.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I think you'll see that.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Sure.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Before he told me what he did for a living,

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
my guess was surveillance.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
He's dressed a bit like a magician.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
He's got a shaved head.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
His face doesn't change expression much.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
He could be either about to hug you or kill you.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Thank you.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
He looks a little like Anton LeVe.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Anton LeVe?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I've gotten Lenin, too, actually.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Yeah, you look a little bit like that.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Yeah, all right.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Well, can you take some notes for us?

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
We're going to try to figure this out throughout the night,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
what our system of laws should be.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
All right, take this down.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Take dictation.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
We, the people of Harmontown, blah, blah, blah.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
Put some fancy shit in there.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Nobody should ever have to do anything they don't want to do.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Everyone should be able to do whatever they want to do.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
If you wanted to do whatever you want to do,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
interferes with someone wanting to do whatever they want to do, dot, dot, dot.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
That's what we have to figure out.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
We'll figure that out by the end of the night.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Now, we were in Atlanta and somebody said,

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
trial by death or something like that.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Fight to the death.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
It doesn't really work, because if I want to punch you in the face,

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
you don't want to get punched in the face,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
you just punch you in the face and then say,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
trial by death, and that's just bullying.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
It doesn't work.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
You just have people that want to punch people,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
walking up to people and punching them.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I think the idea of making a bubble throat.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Yeah, you don't want that.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
You can't do a bubble throat around Dan Harmon

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
because he comes down and you're like a sack of bricks.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I don't think there should be a Constitution.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
How about that?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I think the moment you start writing down any sort of law,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
then that's when you're screwed.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
You can say, are we guarantee free speech?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
That's the last time there is such a thing as free speech,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
because then for the rest of time,

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
lawyers start closing like a big net around what makes free speech.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
You'll fire in a private thing and you can't say something.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
I heard somebody's feeling free.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Speech is never free again.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I think what you're doing right now is dangerous.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah, no, it's illegal.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I'm a terrorist.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
I'm declaring myself a terrorist.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Ben used to work for an organization to fight terrorism.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Oh yeah, that's right.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
We met Ben at the bar earlier.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
What's it called?

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
It's called the NIFA Foundation, 9-Eleven Finding Answers.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
9-Eleven Finding Answers.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
It's a non-governmental agency you said that's dedicated to.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Are you going to get in trouble saying what you're saying?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I don't think so.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
I don't think anyone involved in the organization actually carries a gun

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
in an official capacity, so they'll have to get creative

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
if they want to come after me.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
And you're a substitute teacher now, right, Pat?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Yes.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Does that explain a lot about growing up in your schools?

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
And we came into the bar and he had one headphone in,

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
and that's why Dan thought he worked in surveillance,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
and we said, no, it's much nerdier than what you think it was.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
It was me listening to the works of Tacitus.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Yes.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Awesome.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Part one of the annals.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Yeah, the good one.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Oh yeah.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Part two drags a bit.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
That's our fans.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
It's a guy at a bar who looks like Vladimir Lenin,

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
and he's listening to Tacitus.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
That's awesome.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Nicknames for Charlotte, Jeff.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Want me to make one up?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
The Queen City.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
A little offensive.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Crown Town.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Obviously a reference to Queen City.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
The Hornets Nest.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Ooh.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
That's a political one.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
The Home of NASCAR.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
That's a nickname for that.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
The Gem of the South.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
That's adorable.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
That goes with Queen City.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Why is it called Queen City?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Yeah, I couldn't understand it.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Queen Charlotte.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Now, who was Queen Charlotte?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
She was the Queen.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Right, okay.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
That's a good guess.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
And also, wasn't Charlotte the home,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
or was it just North Carolina?

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
I was reading something about the only successful

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
U.S. coup d'etat

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
that happened here

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
in the 1860s.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Not in a good way, really.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
It was like a bunch of white dudes

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
that were pretty mad about the way things shook out

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
in the Civil War,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
and they just kind of took something over.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
It was very complicated stuff

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
that I did not have time to research over a drink.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
I try to Wikipedia every city that we go to.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Incredibly boring town you have here.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
It's very, very complicated.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Everything's very nuanced.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
You have to have like a 300 IQ

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
to understand the history of Charlotte.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
In Atlanta, we were like,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
ah, there's railroads, and everyone's racist,

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
or, you know, it was fun in Nashville,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
and you're like, oh, Elvis was invented here.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Charlotte, like, you got to really put the glasses on

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
and roll up your sleeves.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
You should be proud of that fact,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
and that's why we're going to have a quiet, thoughtful evening

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
in a military bunker here at the Comedy Zone.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Are you guys from here, or is this like a commuter town?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I'm definitely not from here.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
You're not from here?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Where are you from?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Florida.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
Florida, you have an accent that I can't play.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
No, I grew up in Newcastle.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Newcastle, okay.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
Newcastle, like the English Stephen King company?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Yeah, that's bad.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
He grew up in a Stephen King company.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
That's Castle Rock, sorry.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
I don't know, look, just...

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I think you're making the show too dignified.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Okay.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
All right, well, you want to spice it up with a...

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
I don't know.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
You want to do a quick rap about Charlotte?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Yes.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
Yeah, let's kick this shit into overdrive.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Yo, yo, yo, Charlotte.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Yo, gateway to Carolina.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
All the mountains couldn't look fine.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Looking like Titty's gonna stroke him.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
I fucked your mama.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I like to poke him in the butt.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Fucked her in the butt.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Fucked your mama all the way down and up.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Threw her in the sky.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Fucked her in the eye.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Put my dick in her nose till she died.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
I'm sorry.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Fucked your mama to death.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Fucked your mama till she ran out of breath.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Don't you're in the pool.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Lifted her out.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Fucked your mama.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I got that clout.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
All right.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Okay, all right.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Thanks.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Thanks, guys.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Thanks, Charlotte.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Thanks.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Thanks.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
It's a classy show.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
I need like a big Masterpiece Theater armchair up here.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
Just a shelf of books.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
How are you holding up on this trip so far, Daniel?

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
What are we, like, a third of the way, fourth of the way through?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
I'm good.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
I like all the cities we're going to.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
And everybody's been delightful.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
And everywhere we go, it's just like, you know, the Harmontown fans.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
You guys all listen to the podcast, right?

15:39.000 --> 15:45.000
I'm trying to, I'm scanning the audience for people who don't.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
I feel like I have to ask this every, because we go to these comedy clubs,

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
and I know some of the comedy clubs, like, they fill seats.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
Is there anybody here, be honest, that just got convinced to come here,

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
and then thought that you were going to be seeing stand up?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Uh-oh.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Okay.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
All right.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I'm sorry, you guys.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I'm sorry.

16:06.000 --> 16:15.000
Dan Harmon created a television show called Community, right now.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
And now he thinks that he has a right to travel the country and stand up,

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
get drunk on stage, and have no plans, and no act to speak of.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Sorry.

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
But in my defense, you'd get the same from Rob Schneider.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
He's still working off the same 10 minutes from 1989.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
I bet you.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
He's going to do Elvis on a fish hook,

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
and then he's going to be talking about the government for 90.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
That's not true.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Rob Schneider's here next week.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Come see him.

16:42.000 --> 16:49.000
But I do apologize to the, by my count,

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
six people that were duped into coming here under the impression that I might be

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
like a sort of Bobby Lee figure.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I do apologize.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I could try to do stand up.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Give me a topic.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Hockey.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
What is with this sport, huh?

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
It's certainly not for black people.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Oh.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
That was my bad.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
You can't do a Chris Rock mic drop during somebody else's act.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
For the listeners, that wasn't me dropping the Mike Chris Rock style.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
That was Ben, Ben, Ben dropped his mic.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
And I want answers.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I mean, you got a bunch of ice and they're out there,

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
and it's like, like, like what are you, you're hitting a puck back and forth

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
and a puck.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Well, what is that?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
A Shakespeare reference?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
All right.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
Sorry.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
It probably won't work.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
If it was that easy, I think everybody would do it.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I apologize again.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I'll be apologizing throughout the night.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
I'm certainly sorry to the city of Nashville for what we did there.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
I drank too much.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I think at one point I was naked.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
I'll do it tonight too for you guys if you want.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
You wouldn't believe what my body looks like.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
It's covered in hair.

18:08.000 --> 18:15.000
The weirdest thing about my naked body is that I'm covered shoulder to ankle in

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
this Chewbacca coat.

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
But it looks like I'm wearing skin socks.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Does anyone else have that condition?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I don't have any hair.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
You're like a reverse hobbit.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Yeah.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
Does anyone else have that happening?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Nobody.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Okay.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Actually, yeah, kind of.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Oh, yeah?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Okay.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Keep taking notes, Ben.

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
We, the people of Harmontown, such and such, et cetera, et cetera, having been

18:45.000 --> 18:51.000
appalled by the state of this nation here in this bunker where Hitler killed himself

18:51.000 --> 18:58.000
with sound, mind and body, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, make it sound fancy.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
We choose to be terrorists and criminals.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
You guys don't have to follow me on this if you don't want to.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
You can choose to apt out on your way out.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
But please buy a t-shirt.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
All right, let's work the crowd, Jeff.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
All right.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Do you want some music for this?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Yeah, just some transitional music.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Okay, let me force up some transitional up.

19:22.000 --> 19:29.000
Working the crowd going outside.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
You thought I was on the stage, but now I'm nationwide.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
I'm in your face, in the darkness, sticking mics in your face.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
It's starkness.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Oh, shit.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
What's your name?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Trevor.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Fuck you.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Oh, shit.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
What's your name?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Blair.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
My condolences.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Oh, shit.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Where are you from?

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Wilmington.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
How do you know when you're finished?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Whoa.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Get a look at this guy's hat.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Make fun of his hat.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Go.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
Where'd you get that hat?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Fuck you for wearing a hat.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
Fuck you for wearing a hat.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
I'm sorry.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
I'm sorry.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
I'm sorry.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Sorry.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
I ran into music.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
All right.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
No, no, no.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Yeah, take us out of the music.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
This is not the kind of show I wanted to do.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
Just so you guys know, this is Dan not being drunk.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I got out of control last night in Nashville.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
I'm making up for it with a quiet, dignified show.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
What's your name, ma'am?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Katie.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Katie.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Do you live here in Charlotte?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Yeah.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
You didn't drive that far.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
Still have your coat on in case you need to bolt.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
What do you do for a living?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Can I ask?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
I don't have a job.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Okay.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
How do you know when you're finished, blah, blah, blah?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Can we get you a job?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
What do you want to do?

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
What do you want me to do?

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
I want you to rap.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Rap down.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Break, break down.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
No, I'm kidding.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
No, seriously, what would you do if you could do anything?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I want to be a TV writer.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
All right.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
All right.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Let's give her a job writing TV.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Yeah, you got a couple new shows coming up.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
Yeah, I should be writing them right now.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Are you stuck in any script points that maybe she could help you out?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
You could test her chops right now?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Yeah, I guess so.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Probably.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Would that work?

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Yeah.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Do you like consulting with other people while you're writing a script?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Sure, sure, sure.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
I guess so.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
We could figure out something.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
It was Katie?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Yeah.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
All right.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Katie, come on up.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Let's rate a TV show together.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
Okay, we're going to walk around this way.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
You don't have to run.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
I'm sorry.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
I just do it because I'm like a little baby.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Okay.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
All right.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
Most important thing, Katie, is write what you know.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.320
Like TV executives, they're suspicious of people who actually want to pitch them ideas

22:04.320 --> 22:05.320
and stuff.

22:05.320 --> 22:10.880
They want to hear from people who actually are talking from a place of ownership.

22:10.880 --> 22:16.240
So if you go, when I was growing up in Puerto Rico, I had a mother that was so crazy and

22:16.240 --> 22:18.080
then they go, holy shit, this guy's the real deal.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.680
We're going to have like a flavorful show.

22:19.680 --> 22:22.200
It's going to be spicy and amazing.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.200
That guy could be lying.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.200
It doesn't matter.

22:24.200 --> 22:28.880
But so let's start with, were you born in Charlotte?

22:28.880 --> 22:29.880
No.

22:29.880 --> 22:30.880
Okay.

22:30.880 --> 22:31.880
Where were you born?

22:31.880 --> 22:32.880
New Orleans.

22:32.880 --> 22:33.880
New Orleans.

22:33.880 --> 22:34.880
So why'd you come to Charlotte?

22:34.880 --> 22:35.880
My family brought me.

22:35.880 --> 22:36.880
Okay.

22:36.880 --> 22:37.880
So it's like a kidnapping.

22:37.880 --> 22:41.380
You could say that.

22:41.380 --> 22:43.880
How old were you when your family brought you to Charlotte?

22:43.880 --> 22:44.880
A little.

22:44.880 --> 22:45.880
Okay.

22:45.880 --> 22:46.880
Is that Mike on, Katie?

22:46.880 --> 22:47.880
What?

22:47.880 --> 22:48.880
Is that Mike on?

22:48.880 --> 22:49.880
Or are you just very soft-spoken?

22:49.880 --> 22:50.880
It might not be.

22:50.880 --> 22:51.880
Check.

22:51.880 --> 22:52.880
Check.

22:52.880 --> 22:53.880
It is on.

22:53.880 --> 22:54.880
Okay.

22:54.880 --> 22:55.880
I'll speak louder.

22:55.880 --> 22:56.880
Okay.

22:56.880 --> 22:57.880
Great.

22:57.880 --> 22:59.880
So when you were two years old, your parents came from New Orleans to Charlotte?

22:59.880 --> 23:00.880
Yes.

23:00.880 --> 23:01.880
Why?

23:01.880 --> 23:02.880
Because your dad's job, whatever?

23:02.880 --> 23:03.880
It was what?

23:03.880 --> 23:05.880
Does it have something to do with your dad's work?

23:05.880 --> 23:09.880
No, I think we just had to get out, kind of thing.

23:09.880 --> 23:12.880
I think we had family here, so we had to come here.

23:12.880 --> 23:13.880
Okay.

23:13.880 --> 23:14.880
I was a child.

23:14.880 --> 23:15.880
It wasn't explained to me.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.880
I would just put in the car and go.

23:17.880 --> 23:18.880
All right.

23:18.880 --> 23:19.880
Well, let's...

23:19.880 --> 23:20.880
That sounds like a good show.

23:20.880 --> 23:21.880
Yeah.

23:21.880 --> 23:22.880
I'd watch that.

23:22.880 --> 23:23.880
Let me do it.

23:23.880 --> 23:24.880
It's called Child Abduction.

23:24.880 --> 23:25.880
Let's brainstorm.

23:25.880 --> 23:32.880
Take a seat for a second, Katie, and let me just workshop like a first scene from a show

23:32.880 --> 23:33.880
about your life.

23:33.880 --> 23:34.880
Yeah.

23:34.880 --> 23:35.880
I'm making this up as I go.

23:35.880 --> 23:36.880
Yeah.

23:36.880 --> 23:37.880
Go ahead.

23:37.880 --> 23:38.880
I'm sorry.

23:38.880 --> 23:39.880
No, no.

23:39.880 --> 23:40.880
You can keep the mic.

23:40.880 --> 23:41.880
It's yours to keep.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.880
Everybody here gets to take something from the comedy club tonight.

23:44.880 --> 23:45.880
Yeah.

23:45.880 --> 23:46.880
We're giving everything away.

23:46.880 --> 23:47.880
Yeah.

23:47.880 --> 23:48.880
You all get to keep your chair.

23:48.880 --> 23:52.880
There's like 500 empty chairs we're going to be giving away.

23:52.880 --> 23:53.880
Yeah.

23:53.880 --> 23:54.880
Each of you gets 50.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.880
It's a comedy zone chair giveaway night.

23:56.880 --> 23:57.880
All right.

23:57.880 --> 23:59.880
Jeff, you're a professional improviser.

23:59.880 --> 24:02.880
Would you do the first scene of the Katie pilot?

24:02.880 --> 24:04.880
Is this a cold open?

24:04.880 --> 24:05.880
Yeah, yeah.

24:05.880 --> 24:06.880
Okay.

24:06.880 --> 24:12.880
Katie, your mother's dead.

24:12.880 --> 24:13.880
We're leaving.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.880
Don't ask any questions.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.880
Smash cut to the car.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.880
Katie was born in New Orleans.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.880
Now she's on the run to Charlotte.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.880
She doesn't know why.

24:25.880 --> 24:28.880
Dad, where are we going?

24:28.880 --> 24:30.880
I got some terrible news for you.

24:30.880 --> 24:32.880
We're both werewolves.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.880
But I'm too.

24:34.880 --> 24:35.880
No.

24:35.880 --> 24:39.880
New Orleans was going to build the world's biggest moon.

24:39.880 --> 24:41.880
And we would be werewolves all the time.

24:41.880 --> 24:42.880
We're going through it.

24:42.880 --> 24:43.880
We have to move north.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.880
We have to get away from the moon, honey.

24:46.880 --> 24:50.880
Meanwhile, at the New Orleans government anti-werewolf facility.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.880
Da, da, da.

24:52.880 --> 24:53.880
Pshh.

24:53.880 --> 24:54.880
Pshh.

24:54.880 --> 24:55.880
Pshh.

24:55.880 --> 24:56.880
Pshh.

24:56.880 --> 24:59.880
Agent Henderson reported for duty, sir.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.880
You're late, Henderson.

25:01.880 --> 25:05.880
That's because I go by the phases of the moon.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.880
The scheme of yours to create a larger moon

25:08.880 --> 25:10.880
to out all of New Orleans' werewolves

25:10.880 --> 25:12.880
is going to cost us a pretty penny.

25:12.880 --> 25:14.880
Sir, with all due respect.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.880
I want you off of this moon case.

25:17.880 --> 25:21.880
You're dismissing me from this unit that I created?

25:21.880 --> 25:24.880
You have exactly 12 episodes to catch Katie and her father

25:24.880 --> 25:29.880
before they make it to Charlotte and create a werewolf colony up there.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.880
Then I'm going to do it my own way.

25:32.880 --> 25:33.880
Pshh.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.880
Gil Gerard is agent Henderson.

25:36.880 --> 25:37.880
Henderson?

25:37.880 --> 25:38.880
Yes.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.880
I don't like you, but I like your methods.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.880
Actually, no, I don't like either of them.

25:42.880 --> 25:43.880
I don't like you or your methods.

25:43.880 --> 25:46.880
But I like the fact that you sometimes get results.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.880
I want those werewolves back.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.880
Well, I'm going to get them and I'll show everybody

25:51.880 --> 25:53.880
in this whole government facility.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.880
I'm a man's man usually, but when it comes to these situations,

25:56.880 --> 25:58.880
I get a little cry baby-ish.

25:58.880 --> 25:59.880
Pshh.

25:59.880 --> 26:00.880
Wow.

26:00.880 --> 26:03.880
What a complicated, richly-developed character that was.

26:03.880 --> 26:06.880
You have too many doors.

26:06.880 --> 26:13.880
Meanwhile, at a comfort suites just outside of Charlotte.

26:13.880 --> 26:18.880
Here in the news today, New Orleans had a gas leak.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.880
Dad, it says New Orleans...

26:20.880 --> 26:21.880
Oh, no!

26:21.880 --> 26:24.880
Oh!

26:24.880 --> 26:26.880
Run!

26:26.880 --> 26:28.880
Run, Katie!

26:28.880 --> 26:30.880
The moon is following us.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.880
I'll spite you in another episode.

26:34.880 --> 26:38.880
I got to tuck myself in a crib and tip it into a river.

26:38.880 --> 26:39.880
Pshh.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.880
I got to get away from that moon.

26:44.880 --> 26:47.880
Say, little girl, what are you doing in a river at night all alone?

26:47.880 --> 26:52.880
Oh, Italian gondolier.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.880
My daddy got werewolved by the moon.

26:55.880 --> 26:58.880
The Charlotte River's no place for a little lady like yourself.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.880
I don't know what to think no more.

27:00.880 --> 27:05.880
You've got a strangely ethnically ambiguous mentor to deal with now.

27:05.880 --> 27:10.880
I'll show you how to survive the Charlotte wave.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.880
I got to tell you something, though.

27:12.880 --> 27:13.880
What's your name?

27:13.880 --> 27:15.880
Samantha.

27:15.880 --> 27:19.880
I got to tell you, Samantha, I'm a werewolf.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.880
Oh, we don't judge around here.

27:22.880 --> 27:25.880
We're not like those assholes in Atlanta.

27:25.880 --> 27:30.880
Montage of Katie learning to hone her werewolf abilities

27:30.880 --> 27:33.880
through Samantha's weird, multi-ethnic tutelage.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.880
Rawr.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.880
Rawr.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.880
Rawr.

27:39.880 --> 27:40.880
Rawr.

27:40.880 --> 27:41.880
Rawr.

27:41.880 --> 27:42.880
Rawr.

27:42.880 --> 27:43.880
Rawr.

27:43.880 --> 27:44.880
Rawr.

27:44.880 --> 27:50.880
Over the years, she crows from a toddler to a new biol adolescent.

27:50.880 --> 27:54.880
Katie, I don't have much longer to live.

27:54.880 --> 27:59.880
I feel that I did everything I could for you to turn you into a woman werewolf.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.880
But I'm just getting sexy.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.880
I know, but I can't always be here for you.

28:04.880 --> 28:09.880
But I will be involved in later episodes via voiceover.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.880
I guess that's cool.

28:12.880 --> 28:15.880
It could use punch-up.

28:15.880 --> 28:19.880
Well, I'm going back to Charlotte.

28:19.880 --> 28:21.880
Wait, no, I'm sorry.

28:21.880 --> 28:23.880
Did you hear that?

28:23.880 --> 28:25.880
Rawr.

28:25.880 --> 28:27.880
No!

28:27.880 --> 28:30.880
Werewolf hunting ninjas.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.880
I'm going back to New Orleans.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.880
And that's the end of the pilot.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.880
She goes back to New Orleans.

28:36.880 --> 28:37.880
So you went to Charlotte.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.880
That's probably not how it worked, though, right?

28:39.880 --> 28:41.880
No.

28:41.880 --> 28:44.880
You say that wasn't an accurate depiction of your childhood?

28:44.880 --> 28:46.880
It was close.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.880
You are a werewolf?

28:48.880 --> 28:51.880
That's none of your business.

28:51.880 --> 28:52.880
Wow.

28:52.880 --> 28:53.880
All right.

28:53.880 --> 28:59.880
Well, thank you, Katie, for helping us make that pilot.

28:59.880 --> 29:04.880
I still feel like we haven't really gotten you any work as a TV writer.

29:04.880 --> 29:10.880
In my urgency to entertain the audience, I sort of forgot that goal.

29:10.880 --> 29:14.880
Right what you know?

29:14.880 --> 29:16.880
Right what you know?

29:16.880 --> 29:17.880
Yeah.

29:17.880 --> 29:19.880
What do you know?

29:19.880 --> 29:22.880
Obviously, I know werewolves and...

29:22.880 --> 29:23.880
I don't know.

29:23.880 --> 29:24.880
No, I'm just trying to...

29:24.880 --> 29:25.880
Is that how you wrote community?

29:25.880 --> 29:27.880
Because you went to community college for a while, right?

29:27.880 --> 29:29.880
Was that where that came from?

29:29.880 --> 29:31.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:31.880 --> 29:36.880
So my next pilot is going to be about a guy that has no idea what he's doing,

29:36.880 --> 29:41.880
and just wanders around being sad, drinking a lot,

29:41.880 --> 29:46.880
and doing shows in concrete rooms.

29:46.880 --> 29:47.880
Hey, what's that?

29:47.880 --> 29:54.880
Okay, so if this were a zombie attack, who would be our leader?

29:54.880 --> 30:00.880
Everybody point at somebody immediately, one, two, three, point.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.880
A lot of people point at the English guy.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.880
Well, the guys that came alone pointed at me.

30:05.880 --> 30:08.880
Then there's some people pointing at this guy in the front,

30:08.880 --> 30:10.880
and then there's this guy, I don't know.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.880
This guy looks like he's pretty tough.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.880
Hey, he's got tattoos, he's got a bald head.

30:14.880 --> 30:15.880
What's your name?

30:15.880 --> 30:17.880
What's your name?

30:17.880 --> 30:18.880
John.

30:18.880 --> 30:22.880
John, Senna, you big guy?

30:22.880 --> 30:23.880
Yeah, he's the one.

30:23.880 --> 30:24.880
Yeah.

30:24.880 --> 30:27.880
He's got a little tattoo showing from underneath his sleeves.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.880
I think that speaks larger tattoos underneath that shirt.

30:30.880 --> 30:34.880
John, take your shirt off.

30:34.880 --> 30:37.880
Ben, what do we got on the Constitution of Harmontown?

30:37.880 --> 30:40.880
Yeah, read back what we have so far, Ben.

30:40.880 --> 30:44.880
It's mostly interesting pitches for Katie's first TV show,

30:44.880 --> 30:47.880
and zombie emergency leadership protocols.

30:47.880 --> 30:48.880
Okay.

30:48.880 --> 30:51.880
But also, people should be allowed to do whatever they want to do, right?

30:51.880 --> 30:55.880
Yeah, everybody should, drunk and ramblings,

30:55.880 --> 30:57.880
nobody should do what they don't want to do.

30:57.880 --> 30:58.880
Right.

30:58.880 --> 31:02.880
And we're appalled by the state of this nation,

31:02.880 --> 31:03.880
we're obliged to become criminals.

31:03.880 --> 31:04.880
Appalled?

31:04.880 --> 31:05.880
Yes.

31:05.880 --> 31:06.880
Okay, good.

31:06.880 --> 31:07.880
All right, we'll figure it out.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.880
We'll narrow it down before we leave Charlotte.

31:09.880 --> 31:10.880
And terrorists.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.880
Right, terrorists, something about terrorists.

31:12.880 --> 31:13.880
And terrorists.

31:13.880 --> 31:16.880
Who's the most patriotic person in the audience?

31:16.880 --> 31:17.880
You are?

31:17.880 --> 31:19.880
The guy from Newcastle.

31:19.880 --> 31:22.880
Yeah, are you patriotic about American citizenship

31:22.880 --> 31:24.880
or about your British heritage?

31:24.880 --> 31:25.880
It's actually born here.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.880
Sorry, I'm as American as you are.

31:27.880 --> 31:31.880
You have such a pronounced Newcastle accent, though.

31:31.880 --> 31:32.880
Yeah?

31:32.880 --> 31:33.880
You're born here and you still...

31:33.880 --> 31:35.880
Is it your parents or what?

31:35.880 --> 31:38.880
We moved to Newcastle when I was like six months old.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.880
Ah, so you were born an American and you lived there?

31:41.880 --> 31:42.880
I got you.

31:42.880 --> 31:43.880
I see.

31:43.880 --> 31:44.880
Kind of.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.880
I'm a charming vampire.

31:46.880 --> 31:48.880
What about you?

31:48.880 --> 31:49.880
Are you a patriot?

31:49.880 --> 31:52.880
Can you come up here for a second?

31:52.880 --> 31:54.880
We don't bully anybody at Harmontown.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.880
Here, take Ben's mic.

31:56.880 --> 31:59.880
Fuck that guy.

31:59.880 --> 32:01.880
I was actually talking to Ben before the show.

32:01.880 --> 32:02.880
We went to high school together.

32:02.880 --> 32:03.880
No.

32:03.880 --> 32:04.880
Didn't fucking know it.

32:04.880 --> 32:05.880
You're kidding, really?

32:05.880 --> 32:06.880
No.

32:06.880 --> 32:07.880
What high school?

32:07.880 --> 32:08.880
Clover High School.

32:08.880 --> 32:09.880
Clover High School.

32:09.880 --> 32:10.880
The town with love in the middle.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.880
Where the only culture is agriculture.

32:12.880 --> 32:15.880
What was the Clover High School football team?

32:15.880 --> 32:17.880
The Blue Eels.

32:17.880 --> 32:18.880
The Blue Eagles.

32:18.880 --> 32:21.880
Weird because they're out at their clovers.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.880
The Eagle is what makes my patriotism.

32:23.880 --> 32:25.880
You just have to go lateral and just go fuck it.

32:25.880 --> 32:28.880
Wear worms or a thing because we can't be clovers.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.880
It's too obvious.

32:30.880 --> 32:33.880
All right, so you're a patriot.

32:33.880 --> 32:34.880
Are you like a conservative?

32:34.880 --> 32:35.880
Would you call yourself a right wing?

32:35.880 --> 32:36.880
Fuck no.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.880
Don't be fooled because I look like Mitt Romney's son.

32:39.880 --> 32:41.880
All right.

32:41.880 --> 32:44.880
So you're liberal as probably a lot of Harmontown listeners,

32:44.880 --> 32:46.880
but you're an America lover.

32:46.880 --> 32:47.880
You love America.

32:47.880 --> 32:48.880
I do.

32:48.880 --> 32:49.880
Yeah.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.880
Why don't you marry it?

32:51.880 --> 32:55.880
Because they don't allow gay marriages in North Carolina.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.880
And America's a dude.

32:57.880 --> 32:59.880
We know that for sure.

32:59.880 --> 33:06.880
Because it's got Florida hanging down.

33:06.880 --> 33:08.880
All right, so you're a patriot.

33:08.880 --> 33:13.880
So how can you help refine my constitution?

33:13.880 --> 33:14.880
Amend it.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.880
Okay, if two people want to do whatever they want to do

33:17.880 --> 33:22.880
and it interferes, if I want to smoke a cigarette

33:22.880 --> 33:24.880
and you don't want to breathe my second-hand smoke,

33:24.880 --> 33:26.880
how do we resolve this?

33:26.880 --> 33:28.880
I keep going back to Lord of the Flies.

33:28.880 --> 33:29.880
I mean, you shouldn't just be like,

33:29.880 --> 33:31.880
suck your ass more, Piggy.

33:31.880 --> 33:33.880
We got to figure something out so we don't end up

33:33.880 --> 33:34.880
like Lord of the Flies.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.880
I mean, do you want the conch?

33:36.880 --> 33:37.880
Should we pass that around?

33:37.880 --> 33:38.880
Well, I've had the conch.

33:38.880 --> 33:41.880
I'm trying to pass it around, yeah.

33:41.880 --> 33:44.880
I mean, the problem is human courtesy

33:44.880 --> 33:45.880
has just gone out the window, so...

33:45.880 --> 33:46.880
Right.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.880
We don't think that people are important anymore.

33:48.880 --> 33:49.880
Am I right?

33:49.880 --> 33:50.880
What's your name?

33:50.880 --> 33:51.880
Did I get your name?

33:51.880 --> 33:52.880
No, Nathan.

33:52.880 --> 33:53.880
Nathan, okay.

33:53.880 --> 33:55.880
Human courtesy has gone out the window.

33:55.880 --> 33:58.880
We're not starting with the idea

33:58.880 --> 34:00.880
that people are the most important thing.

34:00.880 --> 34:03.880
I do it too.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.880
If there's dudes sitting on the street,

34:05.880 --> 34:06.880
you step over them.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.880
You've got shit to do.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.880
I'm not going to be the first guy to stop

34:10.880 --> 34:12.880
and go like, okay, I'm not going to work today.

34:12.880 --> 34:13.880
Like, hey, get up.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.880
Let's get you some soup.

34:15.880 --> 34:16.880
Then I'm going to get fired,

34:16.880 --> 34:18.880
and I'll be laying next to him,

34:18.880 --> 34:20.880
and then everyone's afraid of that happening.

34:20.880 --> 34:23.880
So we have to form a new society where you go,

34:23.880 --> 34:26.880
okay, there's a guy laying in the street.

34:26.880 --> 34:27.880
Everyone stop.

34:27.880 --> 34:28.880
Stop it.

34:28.880 --> 34:30.880
Everyone stop what they're doing.

34:30.880 --> 34:31.880
But in order to do that,

34:31.880 --> 34:33.880
you have to kind of like extract yourself

34:33.880 --> 34:36.880
from this machine that we've got going on, right?

34:36.880 --> 34:38.880
It's not a question, I guess.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.880
It should be a people first thing,

34:40.880 --> 34:41.880
but we don't care about that,

34:41.880 --> 34:42.880
because we just don't.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.880
And it's not how we got where we are.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.880
I mean, we built a country

34:46.880 --> 34:50.880
on largely unpaid physical labor.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.880
We couldn't afford to care about people.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.880
We took over the world by like

34:54.880 --> 34:56.880
not giving a shit about people.

34:56.880 --> 34:58.880
So we can't stand here on stage

34:58.880 --> 35:00.880
as a big fat, rich asshole

35:00.880 --> 35:03.880
and say, let's start caring about each other.

35:03.880 --> 35:05.880
It's kind of hypocritical, isn't it?

35:05.880 --> 35:06.880
Yeah.

35:06.880 --> 35:08.880
So what the fuck am I talking about?

35:08.880 --> 35:09.880
I don't know.

35:09.880 --> 35:10.880
I mean...

35:10.880 --> 35:12.880
How do we punish me for my insolence?

35:12.880 --> 35:13.880
I'm an asshole.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.880
I'm an idiot.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.880
You really are too hard on yourself, man.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.880
Okay, well, how do we punish me for that?

35:19.880 --> 35:21.880
We shouldn't punish you.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.880
I think when we punish you, that's the problem.

35:23.880 --> 35:24.880
We can't punish you.

35:24.880 --> 35:26.880
I mean, we just need to...

35:26.880 --> 35:27.880
I don't know.

35:27.880 --> 35:28.880
Hug it out.

35:28.880 --> 35:29.880
Hug it out, yeah.

35:29.880 --> 35:30.880
I mean, connect you.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.880
I think you're pretty well connected.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.880
I mean, you're one of the more generous people.

35:34.880 --> 35:37.880
Like, you have the courtesy to respond to your fans

35:37.880 --> 35:39.880
via Twitter and Reddit and all that shit.

35:39.880 --> 35:40.880
I do give a lot.

35:40.880 --> 35:41.880
I give a lot.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.880
I give a lot

35:53.880 --> 35:55.880
to you.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.880
You're welcome.

35:59.880 --> 36:02.880
You and you.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.880
Every time I see

36:09.880 --> 36:11.880
something

36:12.880 --> 36:15.880
I try to figure out how I can give

36:15.880 --> 36:17.880
myself to it.

36:19.880 --> 36:22.880
But I get caught up

36:22.880 --> 36:24.880
in

36:24.880 --> 36:26.880
songwriting.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.880
Good.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.880
Okay, that's a good song.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.880
You really do give a lot.

36:32.880 --> 36:33.880
Yeah.

36:33.880 --> 36:35.880
No, please.

36:35.880 --> 36:39.880
Let me give you the right to not applaud that.

36:39.880 --> 36:41.880
I'm very generous.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.880
I'm a very generous person.

36:43.880 --> 36:45.880
Rap break!

36:45.880 --> 36:47.880
Oh, shit!

36:52.880 --> 36:53.880
Nathan!

36:53.880 --> 36:55.880
Dan!

36:55.880 --> 36:57.880
I fucked your mama.

36:57.880 --> 36:58.880
That ain't no lie.

36:58.880 --> 37:01.880
I fucked your mama like Jim in American Pie.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.880
Yo!

37:03.880 --> 37:05.880
I fucked your mama in the butt.

37:05.880 --> 37:08.880
I fucked your mama said, what, what?

37:08.880 --> 37:10.880
I fucked your mama.

37:10.880 --> 37:11.880
That's what I'm talking about.

37:11.880 --> 37:13.880
I fucked her in the back so hard.

37:13.880 --> 37:14.880
Dave Matthews came out.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.880
Whoa!

37:18.880 --> 37:20.880
That one was for Jim.

37:20.880 --> 37:22.880
All right, Nathan, thank you.

37:22.880 --> 37:23.880
Thank you very much.

37:23.880 --> 37:24.880
Thank you.

37:24.880 --> 37:26.880
Give me both microphones.

37:26.880 --> 37:27.880
Wow.

37:27.880 --> 37:28.880
He did good.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.880
What a deep reservoir of talent

37:30.880 --> 37:31.880
out in the audience today.

37:31.880 --> 37:33.880
Charlotte, that's why they call Charlotte

37:33.880 --> 37:35.880
the Paris of North Carolina.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.880
It's the Gem of the South.

37:39.880 --> 37:40.880
What was your name again?

37:40.880 --> 37:41.880
I'm sorry.

37:41.880 --> 37:42.880
That was Nathan.

37:42.880 --> 37:43.880
Nathan, yeah.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.880
Nathan, you'll have to sign a release form

37:45.880 --> 37:47.880
so we can sell that on CD.

37:47.880 --> 37:50.880
Nathan, the patriotic mama fucker.

37:52.880 --> 37:53.880
Wait, what's going on here?

37:53.880 --> 37:55.880
I was just seeing if this would make me

37:55.880 --> 37:56.880
extra powerful.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.880
Ben, tell us a story about

38:02.880 --> 38:04.880
somebody pooping their pants in your class

38:04.880 --> 38:05.880
or something.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.880
Like, what's the weirdest thing that happened

38:07.880 --> 38:09.880
when you were substitute teaching a class?

38:09.880 --> 38:11.880
Weirdest thing.

38:13.880 --> 38:14.880
Just a random story.

38:14.880 --> 38:17.880
Some girl puked in her purse.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.880
Some kid took a crap.

38:20.880 --> 38:21.880
I can tell you something that happened

38:21.880 --> 38:23.880
at one of the schools I do substitute at.

38:23.880 --> 38:26.880
At the school, me and Nathan both went to high school at.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.880
Clover High School.

38:28.880 --> 38:30.880
According to Coach Roach,

38:30.880 --> 38:34.880
because we can't hire actual social studies teachers.

38:34.880 --> 38:35.880
Wait, Coach Roach?

38:35.880 --> 38:36.880
Coach Roach.

38:36.880 --> 38:37.880
That's awesome.

38:37.880 --> 38:41.880
Yeah, we live in South Carolina.

38:41.880 --> 38:45.880
We can't afford to hire actual social studies,

38:45.880 --> 38:49.880
science teachers, per se.

38:49.880 --> 38:51.880
So we hire athletic coaches

38:51.880 --> 38:53.880
to cover the social studies

38:53.880 --> 38:55.880
and most of the cultural stuff.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.880
Coach Roach taught a certain slant

38:59.880 --> 39:01.880
on American history.

39:05.880 --> 39:09.880
According to him, he was teaching a class.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.880
He was standardized testing.

39:12.880 --> 39:15.880
Apparently, one of the female students

39:15.880 --> 39:19.880
sat through the entire test

39:19.880 --> 39:21.880
and then asked to be let out.

39:22.880 --> 39:24.880
He said, yeah, fine, if you're done.

39:24.880 --> 39:25.880
And she said she was done.

39:25.880 --> 39:26.880
So she started to go.

39:26.880 --> 39:28.880
And she was moving very carefully,

39:28.880 --> 39:33.880
just kind of shuffling her feet one together.

39:33.880 --> 39:36.880
And she was almost to the door.

39:36.880 --> 39:37.880
She had almost made it.

39:37.880 --> 39:44.880
She was almost home safe when a turd falls right about there,

39:44.880 --> 39:45.880
right behind her.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.880
He's pointing at the stage.

39:47.880 --> 39:50.880
It falls right about there.

39:52.880 --> 39:53.880
That's it.

39:53.880 --> 39:56.880
That's the story I wanted.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.880
The story about a turd falling down your pants.

39:58.880 --> 40:02.880
I thought that Coach Roach wasn't the bad guy in the story.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.880
That was going in a very different direction.

40:04.880 --> 40:05.880
Yeah, I thought.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.880
He taught a very specific type of history.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.880
Did he teach turd history?

40:09.880 --> 40:12.880
Did he?

40:12.880 --> 40:14.880
Was he just really a racist?

40:14.880 --> 40:17.880
Well, Clover High School is the kind of high school

40:17.880 --> 40:22.880
where you learned that FDR deliberately kept the fleet

40:22.880 --> 40:25.880
in Pearl Harbor so that the Japanese would bomb it

40:25.880 --> 40:27.880
so that we could go into World War II.

40:27.880 --> 40:28.880
Wow.

40:28.880 --> 40:29.880
Again, South Carolina.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.880
South Carolina.

40:31.880 --> 40:35.880
Oh yeah, because it was so different.

40:35.880 --> 40:39.880
Did you know, Jeff, that North Carolina did not secede

40:39.880 --> 40:41.880
from the Union until we were in Tennessee

40:41.880 --> 40:44.880
and we were talking about how Tennessee was supposed to.

40:44.880 --> 40:47.880
There was some contention there of who was the last,

40:47.880 --> 40:49.880
which was the last state, because it happened

40:49.880 --> 40:50.880
like within days of each other.

40:50.880 --> 40:53.880
But what we do know is that North Carolina did not leave

40:53.880 --> 40:58.880
the Union until Abraham Lincoln asked them to attack South Carolina.

40:58.880 --> 41:01.880
That's got to be an awkward situation.

41:01.880 --> 41:03.880
I guess that would be a deal breaker for me too

41:03.880 --> 41:06.880
if there had been a North and South Wisconsin.

41:06.880 --> 41:09.880
I would have not wanted to.

41:09.880 --> 41:11.880
Do we have any racists in the audience?

41:11.880 --> 41:15.880
Is there anybody racist?

41:15.880 --> 41:17.880
It would be weird if there was somebody that was like,

41:17.880 --> 41:20.880
I'm racist and came up and wanted to talk about it.

41:20.880 --> 41:22.880
I don't know how we'd handle that,

41:22.880 --> 41:26.880
but we've been having a complicated time of things.

41:26.880 --> 41:29.880
We're these Yankee doodles, whatever you call us,

41:29.880 --> 41:31.880
and we're coming through the South.

41:31.880 --> 41:35.880
Obviously, you guys are going to tend to be progressive,

41:35.880 --> 41:37.880
like liberal.

41:37.880 --> 41:40.880
It's not like my crowd is the tractor pull

41:40.880 --> 41:42.880
and a crowd necessarily.

41:42.880 --> 41:46.880
Nothing against anybody that wants to pull a tractor anywhere.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.880
I'm not saying that at all.

41:48.880 --> 41:49.880
I'm not an elitist.

41:49.880 --> 41:50.880
You don't pull a tractor.

41:50.880 --> 41:52.880
Tractors pull things.

41:52.880 --> 41:53.880
Well, they call them tractor pulls.

41:53.880 --> 41:58.880
Get your shit together.

41:58.880 --> 42:02.880
It's weird when we start talking about the racial stuff

42:02.880 --> 42:04.880
and the history of stuff.

42:04.880 --> 42:06.880
There's this swirl of weird...

42:06.880 --> 42:09.880
It's difficult to talk about down here,

42:09.880 --> 42:15.880
because people feel a compulsion to compensate for the history

42:15.880 --> 42:17.880
and say, well, we're not...

42:17.880 --> 42:19.880
That's not who we are anymore.

42:19.880 --> 42:22.880
It's like, I don't know what my point is.

42:22.880 --> 42:24.880
I don't have one.

42:24.880 --> 42:26.880
My point is I don't have a point.

42:26.880 --> 42:28.880
He killed himself down here.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.880
This is where Hitler died.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.880
He just got tired of being Hitler.

42:33.880 --> 42:37.880
He wrote his final diary entry.

42:37.880 --> 42:41.880
Dear diary, still Hitler.

42:41.880 --> 42:44.880
I can hear the war ending above me.

42:44.880 --> 42:48.880
Not much use for old Hitler anymore.

42:48.880 --> 42:51.880
Guess I'll just tuck it in.

42:51.880 --> 42:55.880
Is it true that he tried the poison on his dog first?

42:55.880 --> 42:58.880
Yeah, he had a dog and he had the cyanide capsule

42:58.880 --> 43:01.880
and he gave it to his dog to make sure it was the real McCoy.

43:01.880 --> 43:04.880
He killed old Blondie first before he had it.

43:04.880 --> 43:06.880
His dog's name was Blondie.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.880
Do you think his dog had a little dog mustache?

43:09.880 --> 43:13.880
Do you think Hitler's car had a little mustache on it?

43:13.880 --> 43:15.880
Do you think his pencils and things?

43:15.880 --> 43:18.880
He did give the world one lasting gift, though.

43:18.880 --> 43:20.880
Because of that funny mustache,

43:20.880 --> 43:22.880
anytime anybody hates the current president,

43:22.880 --> 43:25.880
all you got to do is drop it on the front on George Bush

43:25.880 --> 43:28.880
or on Obama and you've really made your point.

43:28.880 --> 43:32.880
Yeah, Obama, Hitler.

43:32.880 --> 43:34.880
Obama.

43:34.880 --> 43:37.880
I got a few things to rap about him.

43:46.880 --> 43:48.880
Yo, Obama's rap.

43:48.880 --> 43:52.880
Hey, Obama, I fucked your mama. That's it.

43:55.880 --> 43:56.880
Thank you.

43:56.880 --> 43:57.880
Wow.

43:57.880 --> 43:59.880
Thank you, Charlotte.

44:01.880 --> 44:04.880
That was biting social commentary.

44:04.880 --> 44:08.880
I invite the American government to come down here

44:08.880 --> 44:12.880
and seize this bunker if they don't like what they're hearing.

44:12.880 --> 44:15.880
We'll be well out of here.

44:15.880 --> 44:19.880
Rob Schneider will be doing his act in this.

44:19.880 --> 44:22.880
Swat teams will come in.

44:22.880 --> 44:24.880
I'll haul him off to Guantanamo.

44:24.880 --> 44:27.880
Right now, you could edit together a version of what we've done so far

44:27.880 --> 44:29.880
and make a case that you're a bad, bad guy.

44:29.880 --> 44:31.880
Bad citizen, for sure.

44:31.880 --> 44:33.880
You hate the government. You want to be a terrorist.

44:33.880 --> 44:35.880
You try to fuck the president's mama.

44:35.880 --> 44:38.880
I don't want to be a terrorist. I don't want to blow anything up.

44:38.880 --> 44:40.880
That's bad.

44:40.880 --> 44:43.880
I feel like I'm protesting too much.

44:43.880 --> 44:45.880
I don't think you should ever have to see that.

44:45.880 --> 44:48.880
I don't want to blow anything up.

44:48.880 --> 44:50.880
I did a pipe bomb when I was a kid.

44:50.880 --> 44:51.880
Yeah.

44:51.880 --> 44:52.880
Are you two?

44:52.880 --> 44:53.880
Yeah.

44:53.880 --> 44:55.880
Oh, yeah.

44:55.880 --> 44:57.880
You got too proud of that night.

44:57.880 --> 45:01.880
I used to like, my friend Matt Gorley is on the Super Ego podcast.

45:01.880 --> 45:03.880
We were friends in the junior high school.

45:03.880 --> 45:08.880
He had replica guns, like actual working, looking, fired blanks,

45:08.880 --> 45:11.880
like Luger's and Walther's and stuff like that.

45:11.880 --> 45:14.880
We'd go, we'd walk into the Whitwood Mall in Whittier, California

45:14.880 --> 45:16.880
with guns in our belts.

45:16.880 --> 45:18.880
They really looked like the real thing

45:18.880 --> 45:21.880
because they basically were without the firing pin was gone or something like that.

45:21.880 --> 45:23.880
And we'd make bombs and stuff like that.

45:23.880 --> 45:25.880
We were terrible people.

45:25.880 --> 45:27.880
We would be doing a lot of time now.

45:27.880 --> 45:30.880
Actually, detectives came to our school

45:30.880 --> 45:34.880
and a plainclothes detective pulled me out for a bomb threat

45:34.880 --> 45:38.880
because I drew some girl that was a junior park in senior parking.

45:38.880 --> 45:42.880
So Matt and I drew a picture of her car exploding and a soccer ball flying out

45:42.880 --> 45:44.880
because she played soccer.

45:44.880 --> 45:47.880
And the fucking LAPD, like the detectives came

45:47.880 --> 45:49.880
because it's a terrorist threat.

45:49.880 --> 45:54.880
I remember my friend Dan Ramstack and I made a...

45:54.880 --> 45:55.880
Ramstack?

45:55.880 --> 45:58.880
We figured out how to make lights blink with batteries

45:58.880 --> 46:00.880
and we took electrical tape and like wrapped it around

46:00.880 --> 46:03.880
and we made this thing that had like blinking lights on them

46:03.880 --> 46:07.880
and we taped it to our neighbor's front screen door

46:07.880 --> 46:09.880
and it just ran away.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.880
And I don't know what we were thinking.

46:11.880 --> 46:12.880
I don't think we thought...

46:12.880 --> 46:14.880
We weren't trying to say this is a bomb.

46:14.880 --> 46:17.880
We thought maybe they would think it was like a robot or something.

46:17.880 --> 46:19.880
But the fucking bomb squad showed up

46:19.880 --> 46:21.880
because Google...

46:21.880 --> 46:23.880
I had a crush on the girl.

46:23.880 --> 46:25.880
This is how I expressed it.

46:25.880 --> 46:27.880
But he showed up and looked at it

46:27.880 --> 46:29.880
and went like, okay, all right, 9-1-1.

46:29.880 --> 46:32.880
And then there were just guys in white pajamas running around

46:32.880 --> 46:35.880
diffusing this Christmas light.

46:35.880 --> 46:38.880
That was before 9-11, Jeff. Everything changed on 9-11.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.880
I don't know if you guys knew that.

46:40.880 --> 46:43.880
Everything changed on 9-11.

46:43.880 --> 46:45.880
Right, Ben?

46:45.880 --> 46:47.880
So they kept telling me when I worked for that place.

46:47.880 --> 46:49.880
And then they downsized you.

46:49.880 --> 46:50.880
Yes.

46:50.880 --> 46:53.880
Now you're teaching kids how to roll turds out of their pants.

46:53.880 --> 46:56.880
You used to be America's first line of defense

46:56.880 --> 46:59.880
against more 9-11s happening.

46:59.880 --> 47:03.880
Against chiefly 18- and 19-year-olds from Damascus, apparently.

47:03.880 --> 47:04.880
Right.

47:04.880 --> 47:06.880
See, I used to give...

47:06.880 --> 47:08.880
Me and my friends were terrible people.

47:08.880 --> 47:10.880
We used to give substitute teachers a lot of shit.

47:10.880 --> 47:12.880
But you seem like a pretty intimidating guy.

47:12.880 --> 47:14.880
I don't know if I would mess with you.

47:14.880 --> 47:18.880
The way it usually goes is they come in

47:18.880 --> 47:21.880
and they're being little shits because they're teenagers, right?

47:21.880 --> 47:27.880
And then it takes one good excuse me.

47:27.880 --> 47:29.880
Can you give us an example?

47:29.880 --> 47:31.880
That wasn't an example, right?

47:31.880 --> 47:33.880
No, that was not an example. Really?

47:33.880 --> 47:34.880
Because a kid...

47:34.880 --> 47:36.880
Can you make this to your chalkboard here

47:36.880 --> 47:39.880
and I'll be in the back of the class?

47:39.880 --> 47:41.880
Alright.

47:41.880 --> 47:43.880
Shit, fuck school.

47:43.880 --> 47:45.880
Fuck education.

47:45.880 --> 47:49.880
All I care about is 2 plus pussy.

47:49.880 --> 47:52.880
Donald, we're in class.

47:52.880 --> 47:54.880
No, I demand you misbehave like me.

47:54.880 --> 47:56.880
It's peer pressure.

47:56.880 --> 47:58.880
Alright, fuck you.

47:58.880 --> 47:59.880
Fuck everybody.

47:59.880 --> 48:03.880
Excuse me!

48:03.880 --> 48:06.880
There's my fucking mic drop.

48:06.880 --> 48:10.880
Excuse me.

48:10.880 --> 48:13.880
Jeff mined walking away pooping his pants.

48:13.880 --> 48:14.880
We're having a lot more fun in Charlotte

48:14.880 --> 48:17.880
than you can hear on the podcast.

48:17.880 --> 48:18.880
You really have to feel the...

48:18.880 --> 48:20.880
Alright, second episode of Katie's CW show

48:20.880 --> 48:26.880
about werewolves in New Orleans.

48:26.880 --> 48:29.880
Episode 2, what's the title?

48:29.880 --> 48:32.880
Does somebody say a noun?

48:32.880 --> 48:33.880
Ants.

48:33.880 --> 48:34.880
Umbrella.

48:34.880 --> 48:38.880
Episode 2, umbrella.

48:38.880 --> 48:41.880
A new biol adolescent, Katie,

48:41.880 --> 48:47.880
walks down the halls of New Orleans High School.

48:47.880 --> 48:50.880
Excuse me.

48:50.880 --> 48:52.880
Bump into people much?

48:52.880 --> 48:54.880
Sorry, I was on the way to football practice.

48:54.880 --> 48:56.880
You need to learn some man's.

48:56.880 --> 49:01.880
That's just we can talk for manners.

49:01.880 --> 49:04.880
Wait, aren't you that werewolf girl?

49:04.880 --> 49:05.880
Shut the fuck up.

49:05.880 --> 49:07.880
Everybody knows.

49:07.880 --> 49:08.880
Shut up!

49:08.880 --> 49:09.880
What are you going to do?

49:09.880 --> 49:10.880
Eat my chickens at night?

49:10.880 --> 49:11.880
Shut up!

49:11.880 --> 49:12.880
It's a metaphor.

49:12.880 --> 49:13.880
Chicken lover?

49:13.880 --> 49:14.880
Werewolf lady?

49:14.880 --> 49:21.880
It's such an apt metaphor for my period.

49:21.880 --> 49:28.880
I'm going to the only coffee shop where I feel okay to be me.

49:28.880 --> 49:32.880
I'll have a coffee, because I'm 16.

49:32.880 --> 49:35.880
Hello, Katie.

49:35.880 --> 49:38.880
The ghost of Samantha.

49:38.880 --> 49:43.880
After I died, I became a barista at this coffee place.

49:43.880 --> 49:50.880
Would you like a haunted cappuccino?

49:50.880 --> 49:51.880
This is crazy.

49:51.880 --> 49:54.880
Listen, if anybody starts teasing you, remember what I taught you.

49:54.880 --> 49:56.880
You've got to be who you are, Katie.

49:56.880 --> 49:58.880
Oh, this came for you.

49:58.880 --> 50:00.880
It's a letter.

50:00.880 --> 50:03.880
I don't know why it comes to the coffee place.

50:03.880 --> 50:09.880
Follow the umbrella?

50:09.880 --> 50:11.880
I've got to get back to work.

50:11.880 --> 50:13.880
See, it really worked out.

50:13.880 --> 50:14.880
I'm in the weeds, Katie.

50:14.880 --> 50:16.880
It's slammed in here right now.

50:16.880 --> 50:23.880
Okay, well, I'm going to go to this patern address and see if I can track down 355 for the cappuccino.

50:23.880 --> 50:24.880
Shit.

50:24.880 --> 50:25.880
God damn it.

50:25.880 --> 50:27.880
I was your mentor.

50:27.880 --> 50:29.880
I didn't take advantage of me like an asshole.

50:29.880 --> 50:35.880
Two, three, one, pickle boulevard.

50:35.880 --> 50:40.880
Knocking on the door.

50:40.880 --> 50:42.880
Action set piece.

50:42.880 --> 50:49.880
Got your metal shin guards on, I see.

50:49.880 --> 50:52.880
The sword's meaningless and...

50:52.880 --> 50:53.880
Knock, knock.

50:53.880 --> 50:54.880
Who's there?

50:54.880 --> 50:55.880
Wolfwoman.

50:55.880 --> 51:00.880
C.G. shot.

51:00.880 --> 51:01.880
Wolfwoman.

51:01.880 --> 51:02.880
Wolfwoman.

51:02.880 --> 51:03.880
Wolfwoman.

51:03.880 --> 51:04.880
Wolfwoman.

51:04.880 --> 51:05.880
Wolfwoman.

51:05.880 --> 51:06.880
Wolfwoman.

51:06.880 --> 51:07.880
Wolfwoman.

51:07.880 --> 51:08.880
Wolfwoman.

51:08.880 --> 51:09.880
Wolfwoman.

51:09.880 --> 51:10.880
Wolfwoman.

51:10.880 --> 51:11.880
Wolfwoman.

51:11.880 --> 51:12.880
Wolf knight.

51:12.880 --> 51:13.880
Wolf knight.

51:13.880 --> 51:14.880
Wolf knight.

51:14.880 --> 51:15.880
Wolf knight.

51:15.880 --> 51:16.880
Wolf knight.

51:16.880 --> 51:17.880
Wolf knight.

51:17.880 --> 51:18.880
Wolf knight.

51:18.880 --> 51:19.880
Wolf knight.

51:19.880 --> 51:20.880
Wolf knight.

51:20.880 --> 51:21.880
Wolf knight.

51:21.880 --> 51:22.880
Wolf knight.

51:22.880 --> 51:23.880
Wolf knight.

51:23.880 --> 51:24.880
Wolf knight.

51:24.880 --> 51:25.880
Wolf knight.

51:25.880 --> 51:26.880
Wolf knight.

51:26.880 --> 51:27.880
Wolf knight.

51:27.880 --> 51:28.880
Wolf knight.

51:28.880 --> 51:29.880
Wolf knight.

51:29.880 --> 51:30.880
Wolf knight.

51:30.880 --> 51:31.880
Wolf knight.

51:31.880 --> 51:32.880
Wolf knight.

51:32.880 --> 51:33.880
Wolf knight.

51:33.880 --> 51:34.880
Wolf knight.

51:34.880 --> 51:35.880
Wolf knight.

51:35.880 --> 51:37.880
Wolf knight.

51:37.880 --> 51:38.880
Wolf knight.

51:38.880 --> 51:39.880
Wolf knight.

51:39.880 --> 51:40.880
Wolf knight.

51:40.880 --> 51:49.240
You see, you've been living under a giant sky umbrella for the last seven months, not knowing

51:49.240 --> 51:53.320
that we've turned the moon red.

51:53.320 --> 51:56.320
All of your kind will be extinct.

51:56.320 --> 51:57.480
No.

51:57.480 --> 51:58.480
Commercial break.

51:58.480 --> 51:59.480
Go-bond powder.

51:59.480 --> 52:04.480
It's the best powder ever.

52:04.480 --> 52:05.480
Yeah, yeah.

52:05.480 --> 52:08.640
Sorry, sorry, he bailed on that commercial.

52:08.640 --> 52:09.640
You deserve a full commercial.

52:09.640 --> 52:11.400
Let's do the gold-bond powder commercial.

52:11.400 --> 52:13.560
Okay, so what was the last line?

52:13.560 --> 52:17.560
Living under the moon is red, and all your kind will be extinct.

52:17.560 --> 52:18.560
No.

52:18.560 --> 52:20.560
Do your balls itch.

52:20.560 --> 52:21.560
Yes.

52:21.560 --> 52:22.560
Try gold-bond powder.

52:22.560 --> 52:23.560
All right.

52:23.560 --> 52:24.560
Holy shit, they don't itch.

52:24.560 --> 52:35.560
Coming up next on Fox, don't miss an all-new episode of Cake Bakers.

52:35.560 --> 52:42.560
Look, I made this thing three cheers, and it's got frosting.

52:42.560 --> 52:44.400
Blimp you, blimp you.

52:44.400 --> 52:46.400
Check it out, Freddy.

52:46.400 --> 52:47.400
Wichita.

52:47.400 --> 52:48.400
Wichita.

52:48.400 --> 52:52.760
Wichita has a glossy coat because of a chuck wagon.

52:52.760 --> 52:57.360
You should give it to your dog.

52:57.360 --> 53:02.240
I'm asked, head.

53:02.240 --> 53:05.360
From Bonanza.

53:05.360 --> 53:10.840
Now back to Teenage Werewolf, New Orleans unit.

53:10.840 --> 53:13.480
Let me out of this cell.

53:13.480 --> 53:21.560
I can sense you with my werewolf powers not uttering me, son of a bitch, if I could just

53:21.560 --> 53:26.880
flash back to Samantha, maybe I would get some kind of wisdom on how to get out of here.

53:26.880 --> 53:29.760
I'm always with you, Katie.

53:29.760 --> 53:32.800
I quit my job at the coffee place.

53:32.800 --> 53:35.120
I work at the jail now.

53:35.120 --> 53:38.120
I'm locked in some kind of cell at some kind of umbrella corporation.

53:38.120 --> 53:45.280
Listen, I didn't raise you up as a young werewolf lady to give up so easily.

53:45.280 --> 53:47.800
I raised a strong-minded woman.

53:47.800 --> 53:49.800
You're 13 now, Katie.

53:49.800 --> 53:50.800
Right?

53:50.800 --> 53:52.800
Yeah, I take the answer.

53:52.800 --> 53:56.680
I was dead for a while, and we lost track.

53:56.680 --> 54:05.080
All right, I'll just tell you, this cell isn't as strong as you think it is.

54:05.080 --> 54:07.880
Think it is.

54:07.880 --> 54:11.000
Rhymes with stink-a-mizz.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.760
The company that makes this bolt on the ceiling.

54:13.760 --> 54:17.040
A hatch opens.

54:17.040 --> 54:18.560
That was easy.

54:18.560 --> 54:21.480
Time to kick-box my way to the end of the episode.

54:21.480 --> 54:34.920
I know there'll be more like you in episodes two through twelve.

54:34.920 --> 54:39.400
It's in the way that you use it.

54:39.400 --> 54:41.400
Back to the school.

54:41.400 --> 54:42.400
Uh-oh.

54:42.400 --> 54:44.400
Hey, watch it.

54:44.400 --> 54:45.400
Sorry.

54:45.400 --> 54:47.880
I thought you were gone.

54:47.880 --> 54:48.880
You know what?

54:48.880 --> 54:52.600
I heard you went to jail, probably for being a werewolf.

54:52.600 --> 54:56.000
Maybe I learned it's worth sticking things out and fighting for what I believe in.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Can I ask you a question?

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
Yeah.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.280
It's kind of personal, though.

55:01.280 --> 55:02.280
I'm 13.

55:02.280 --> 55:03.280
I can take it.

55:03.280 --> 55:11.280
I just want to know, when the moon comes out, like, are you hairy everywhere?

55:11.280 --> 55:15.280
Dick Wolf, free-spray.

55:15.280 --> 55:16.280
All right.

55:16.280 --> 55:17.280
Wow.

55:17.280 --> 55:20.280
That's a good show, Katie.

55:20.280 --> 55:26.040
If I pitch that, you're on board, you're a head writer.

55:26.040 --> 55:29.280
Is there a reason why werewolves have metal shidnguards?

55:29.280 --> 55:31.280
I don't know.

55:31.280 --> 55:33.280
I don't know, man.

55:33.280 --> 55:35.280
Is that a vulnerable part of a werewolf?

55:35.280 --> 55:37.280
Ask yourself that.

55:37.280 --> 55:39.280
Let's bring Spencer up, our Dungeon Master.

55:39.280 --> 55:41.280
Oh, shit, yeah.

55:41.280 --> 55:47.280
We're going to have to say goodbye to Ben for a moment so Spencer can take his place.

55:47.280 --> 55:49.280
Yeah, Ben's been using the Spencer table.

55:49.280 --> 55:50.280
All right, Spencer, our Dungeon Master.

55:50.280 --> 55:54.280
For those of you who don't know, we play D&D on this show, and Spencer has traveled all

55:54.280 --> 55:56.280
the way from California to join us.

55:56.280 --> 56:00.280
Spencer, everyone.

56:00.280 --> 56:02.280
Charlotte.

56:02.280 --> 56:04.280
Right?

56:04.280 --> 56:07.280
Spencer, what do you think of how the show's been going?

56:07.280 --> 56:09.280
It's been really good.

56:09.280 --> 56:10.280
I've been laughing.

56:10.280 --> 56:11.280
Can you hear me back there?

56:11.280 --> 56:13.280
You don't think it's a little weird?

56:13.280 --> 56:14.280
I like weird?

56:14.280 --> 56:15.280
Oh, OK.

56:15.280 --> 56:16.280
That makes sense.

56:16.280 --> 56:18.280
Spencer's toes are fused together.

56:18.280 --> 56:19.280
We found out.

56:19.280 --> 56:22.280
And you can go on Instagram and you can see a picture of his toes.

56:22.280 --> 56:23.280
He has a thing.

56:23.280 --> 56:24.280
Do you...

56:24.280 --> 56:25.280
Yes, ma'am?

56:25.280 --> 56:27.280
People in our family have that also.

56:27.280 --> 56:28.280
Yeah.

56:28.280 --> 56:30.280
It's called syndactyly.

56:30.280 --> 56:31.280
Yeah.

56:31.280 --> 56:32.280
That's what it's called?

56:32.280 --> 56:34.280
Syndactyly family members from South Carolina.

56:34.280 --> 56:36.280
I have two other ones.

56:36.280 --> 56:37.280
South Carolina.

56:37.280 --> 56:38.280
Yeah, yeah.

56:38.280 --> 56:40.280
You guys really hate South Carolina, don't you?

56:40.280 --> 56:42.280
They do not want it.

56:42.280 --> 56:44.280
South Carolina.

56:44.280 --> 56:47.280
What is the difference between North and South?

56:47.280 --> 56:48.280
T.

56:48.280 --> 56:49.280
T.

56:49.280 --> 56:50.280
T.

56:50.280 --> 56:51.280
T.

56:51.280 --> 56:52.280
T.

56:52.280 --> 56:53.280
T.

56:53.280 --> 56:54.280
T.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.280
T.

56:55.280 --> 56:56.280
T.

56:56.280 --> 56:58.280
T.

56:58.280 --> 56:59.280
T.

56:59.280 --> 57:02.280
So, out of the 50 states, South Carolina is 50th.

57:02.280 --> 57:04.280
They are dead last.

57:04.280 --> 57:05.280
You guys here are 48.

57:05.280 --> 57:06.280
Whoo!

57:06.280 --> 57:07.280
We're all right.

57:07.280 --> 57:09.280
Are you like the governor?

57:09.280 --> 57:11.280
You're so invested.

57:11.280 --> 57:12.280
What's your name?

57:12.280 --> 57:13.280
My name is Henry.

57:13.280 --> 57:15.280
Henry...

57:15.280 --> 57:18.280
I don't know, I want to uncork this guy.

57:18.280 --> 57:19.280
I want to rub this genie's lamp.

57:19.280 --> 57:21.280
I want to know more about North Carolina from like,

57:21.280 --> 57:23.280
what...?

57:23.280 --> 57:26.600
If I just stick the microphone in your face, will you say interesting things or do I have

57:26.600 --> 57:28.400
to be a good interviewer?

57:28.400 --> 57:29.400
Okay.

57:29.400 --> 57:38.640
There's not a lot to be proud of when you live in North Carolina, but the few things

57:38.640 --> 57:42.920
we have is that we're better than South Carolina.

57:42.920 --> 57:44.640
Is there anyone from South Carolina here?

57:44.640 --> 57:45.640
Oh, Jesus.

57:45.640 --> 57:46.640
Holy shit.

57:46.640 --> 57:51.040
Dude, he's surrounded by South Carolinans.

57:51.040 --> 58:03.800
I'm going to go out and- Okay, you've got this whole table of South Carolina.

58:03.800 --> 58:04.800
All right.

58:04.800 --> 58:06.680
What do you have to say in South Carolina's defense over here?

58:06.680 --> 58:08.560
South Carolina's a shit.

58:08.560 --> 58:14.640
Now, it's hard to argue with that.

58:14.640 --> 58:15.640
Yeah.

58:15.640 --> 58:21.240
You guys, you can't be proud that you're 50th in education, probably, right?

58:21.240 --> 58:24.240
No, but our education system is broken anyway, so.

58:24.240 --> 58:25.240
Yeah.

58:25.240 --> 58:33.320
Bob Jones University, which is like a conservative Christian university there in South Carolina.

58:33.320 --> 58:38.000
Actually, even Jeff, when Christians talk about making South Carolina a homeland and

58:38.000 --> 58:41.360
succeeding from the Union once again, it's a messed up place.

58:41.360 --> 58:42.360
All right.

58:42.360 --> 58:45.160
Jeff, we have a serious human conflict here.

58:45.160 --> 58:49.240
On the night that I decided we have to figure out a new way to resolve human conflict.

58:49.240 --> 58:50.240
You know what?

58:50.240 --> 58:54.120
I'm going to be the representative for South Carolina, and I'm going to-

58:54.120 --> 58:55.280
That's not very brave of you.

58:55.280 --> 58:56.280
You're surrounded by-

58:56.280 --> 58:57.280
Yeah.

58:57.280 --> 59:03.080
Dan, Dan, I got to tell you, it's the shit.

59:03.080 --> 59:08.840
But Abraham Lincoln wanted North Carolina to attack South Carolina, and the Carolinas

59:08.840 --> 59:11.120
pulled together and said, look, we're both Carolinas.

59:11.120 --> 59:13.240
It seems like a logical thing.

59:13.240 --> 59:18.040
Now there's all this division again, just because of a simple direction on a compass.

59:18.040 --> 59:19.040
Yeah.

59:19.040 --> 59:22.560
How do you guys feel about Virginia, or do you guys care about that, or is it just because

59:22.560 --> 59:23.560
you share a name?

59:23.560 --> 59:25.040
Henry, how do you feel about Virginia?

59:25.040 --> 59:27.360
I think Virginia is slightly better than North Carolina.

59:27.360 --> 59:28.360
Oh, really?

59:28.360 --> 59:29.360
Yeah.

59:29.360 --> 59:30.360
Wait, better than North?

59:30.360 --> 59:31.360
Yeah.

59:31.360 --> 59:33.360
Oh, so you're self-loathing, Carolina.

59:33.360 --> 59:34.360
Okay.

59:34.360 --> 59:35.360
Well, we can't-

59:35.360 --> 59:40.640
It's not that you love North Carolina so much, it's just that it is just a little bit better

59:40.640 --> 59:41.640
than South Carolina.

59:41.640 --> 59:42.640
It's our little thing.

59:42.640 --> 59:43.640
It could be worse.

59:43.640 --> 59:49.160
You just want to hop on our tour bus and come smoke weed in California, and be liberal

59:49.160 --> 59:50.160
and cosmopolitan.

59:50.160 --> 59:51.160
I understand that.

59:51.160 --> 59:56.160
Well, you probably, yeah, you probably grow it a lot here, right?

59:56.160 --> 59:58.160
Yeah, something in the back.

59:58.160 --> 59:59.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.680
Look, this is a-

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:05.040
We're not talking about your exact right about a simple direction of North Carolina and South

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.040
Carolina.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.560
There is a plot that we can't do.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:09.560
Okay, okay.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.360
Jeff, I'm handing her the mic.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.360
Okay.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:18.680
I'm Adrienne, and I'm from North Carolina, and there's a lot to be proud of for North

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:19.680
Carolina.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.120
We have a ton of awesome things here.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.640
Everybody loves North Carolina.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.120
South Carolina has awesome things.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.120
What are you guys proud of?

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.120
It's just a-

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.120
Huh?

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.120
Everything.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.200
I mean, we have great people.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.960
North Carolina has, no, not just NASCAR.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.640
That's everything that people pick on.

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.680
Don't you guys have like peanut butter pie here?

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.680
Is that a thing here?

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:41.680
We're not just-

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.680
Yeah.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.680
Yeah, there we go.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.680
That's pretty good.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:45.680
People don't just have-

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.680
I like what you've been saying about getting people together.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:48.680
Well, I'm a-

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:49.680
Hey, how are you?

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.680
I forgot your name already.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.680
I'm Adrienne.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.680
Nice to meet you.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.680
It's nice to meet you.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.680
Nice to meet you.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.680
What's your name?

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.680
Adrienne.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.680
Adrienne, all right.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.680
Adrienne.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.680
I came out on a crappy weather night.

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:01.680
They've been after-

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.680
You thought Rob Schneider was going to be here?

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.680
Bruh, no.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.680
You're way better.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:10.320
So, I'm excited to be here, and everything you guys have said has been awesome.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:14.320
But we all are here together, North Carolina, South Carolina, who cares, have friends all

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.320
over the world.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.320
Yeah.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.320
And everybody's just here to have fun.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.320
It's a comedy.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.320
Good job.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.320
Adrienne, everybody.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.320
Wow.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.320
All right.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.320
We're just having a good time.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.320
We don't need to talk about the Civil War and-

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.320
Well, that's my fault.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.320
That's my fault.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.320
No, but you're an awesome guy.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.320
We appreciate you coming.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.520
We get awesome comedy.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.520
We have museums.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:35.520
We have history.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.520
We have the mountains.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.520
We have awesome stuff in North Carolina.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.520
She's like an awesome Sesame Street character.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.520
She's just back.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.520
She's the only one seated behind the wall.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:45.520
She was like, just popped out of a little trash can.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.520
Why don't y'all just love each other?

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.520
I'm like the cute version of the Grouch.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.520
I'm like, I love America.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.520
I love everybody.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.520
Yeah, you popped up to help us love each other.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.520
That's right.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.520
They all know me here.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.520
This is a lot.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.520
Hey, Blair.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.520
Hey, Patrick.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.520
Wait, if she knows you, why is she taking secret pictures of you?

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.520
These are okay.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.520
It's an Instagram later.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.520
Hey, these are all comedians here.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.520
They want to be up there, but I'm not a comedian.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.520
I just want to tell everybody to love each other.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.520
You know what I think?

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.520
It's time for a dance.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.520
What?

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.520
I think it's time for you and Adrienne to do the happiness wrap.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.520
Yeah, let's hug it out.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.520
All right.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.520
You're cute.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.520
Come on.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:20.520
Hug it up.

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.520
Are we going to dance?

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.520
Yeah.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.520
Happiness wrap with Adrienne.

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:28.520
Wrap it in the back.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:29.520
Shit.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.520
Happiness wrap.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:37.520
We're at the Comedy Zone, an NC music factory.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.520
How can we dance so fast?

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.520
I'm a little baby.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.520
I'm a little toddler.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.520
Adrienne, wrap it in the back.

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.520
I fucked your mama like she was on crack.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:50.520
I put my dick in her butt, put it in her mouth.

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.520
Carolina, north and south.

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.520
Whoa.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.520
No.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.520
No, they're the same.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:56.520
Carolina.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.520
It's all just game.

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.520
The government.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.520
The government.

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:01.520
Welcome me to the front.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.520
Oh, no.

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.520
I just called you.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.520
The Carolinas, they're all the same.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.520
It's just a big government game.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.520
Try to make it feel different, put you against each other.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.520
People fighting brother-brother.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.520
Brother-brother.

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.520
Civil war.

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.520
Bullshit.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.520
Bullshit.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.520
Put your mama up.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.520
No.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.520
Love it up.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.520
Now, Carolina.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.520
South Carolina.

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.520
Woo.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.520
Everybody.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.520
Love it out.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:30.520
What's up?

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:31.520
Love it out.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.520
Who cares?

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.520
Love it out.

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.520
Love it out?

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.520
I don't know.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.520
Do it.

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.520
No shit.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.520
It's all right.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:39.520
It's all right.

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.520
It's all right.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.520
Love it out.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.520
Party foul.

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.520
Thank you.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.520
Thank you, Adrienne.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.520
All right.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.520
Adrienne, everybody.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.520
This mic's a lot less hot than this mic.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.520
Thank you.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.520
You're wrong.

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.520
Thank you for coming here to show us.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.520
Do you work here, Adrienne?

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:55.520
No, I just came out.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.520
Because it's cold.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:57.520
That's a laugh.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.520
Oh, it won't.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.520
Yeah.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.520
You know, Dan, actually, it's weird.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:07.520
Adrienne actually died 15 years ago.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.520
That's her ghost?

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.520
Yeah.

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:13.520
She had snakes for hair.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.520
That's a ghost story.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.520
The comedy zone is haunted by the most positive ghost in the world.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:22.520
It makes sense, because Hitler died here.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:29.520
So, of course, it would be haunted by a very happy lady.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.520
So the Hitler's bunker is haunted by a Jewish ghost.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.520
Happy Jew.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:34.520
Happy Jew.

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.520
Hey.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.520
It could be worse.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:41.520
That's Hitler's purgatory, is he has to walk around his death bunker.

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.520
And Adrienne is just like, hey, hug it out.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.520
Hug it out, Hitler.

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.520
Hitler, have a sandwich.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:46.520
Come on, Hitler.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.520
Would you eat something?

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.520
I forgive you, Hitler.

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.520
Hey, let the bygones be the bygones.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:56.520
And Hitler's like, this is a way to live your life.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.520
This is a place to die.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.520
We went to the Anne Frank Museum in, what do you call it, Amsterdam?

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.520
That was some heavy shit.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.520
Me and Aaron, I don't know.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.520
I'm done with that conversation.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.520
But it was weird.

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.520
You know, you can't help when you're somewhere that serious.

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.520
Is the house still there?

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.520
Do you get to go up into the attic and stuff?

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:21.520
Yeah, but everything is reinforced with stainless steel to keep everyone from farting on something

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.520
important.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:32.520
And her dad demanded out of deference to, because once the Frank family got turned in,

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.520
the Nazis came there and they cleared all the shit out.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:40.520
And her dad said, don't ever furnish it as a museum.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:43.520
All the rooms should be empty as a symbolic thing.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.520
So you're really just, I mean, good for him.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:50.520
I'm certainly not going to tell him how to run an Anne Frank Museum.

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:53.520
But the customer is always right.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.520
A little boring.

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.520
Could use a couple sofas.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:05.520
You really are just walking through and reading stuff in the wall that you could probably Google.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:09.520
You could Google a lot of it.

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.520
They should call it the pre-Google Memorial Museum.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:20.520
I think they literally went on Google, printed the stuff, put it in a plexiglass frame,

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:25.520
hung it on the wall, you walk through, look at the stuff that they Googled.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.520
Fuck you, Anne Frank Museum.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.520
Sorry.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.520
That's a bold stance, man.

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.520
Someone's got to take it.

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.520
It sounds like you really suffered.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:39.520
Speaking of suffering, I think it's time to play a little D&D.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.520
How do you guys feel?

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520
Let's do it.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.520
What are you guys going for?

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:46.520
We're going to need Aaron up here, though.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:50.520
Erin McGathy to the stage, please. Erin McGathy.

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:54.520
I wish we had a mic.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:58.520
I don't know that idea, because we have a mic pointed at the audience,

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.520
and it's right in front of your face.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.520
What's your name, sir?

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.520
Drew.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.520
Drew, would you take this mic and, like, we never do this for D&D.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:13.520
Sound effects for anything, like if they say a horse gallops up,

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.520
like you might do.

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:18.520
You can come up and share my mic, Drew.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:22.520
If you're in Amsterdam, still check out the Anne Frank Museum.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:25.520
It's pretty moving.

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.520
The explanation for the furniture not being there was that so many people were lost,

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.520
so there can't be anything in the building.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.520
It was a little silly.

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:37.520
There must have been something else that was going on there.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.520
No, no, I'm not.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.520
I know.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:45.520
I would hate for anyone here to be in Amsterdam to be like,

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.520
well, Dan Harmon said to not go to the museum.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.520
Go, still go.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.520
Is there a gift shop there?

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.520
There is, yeah.

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.520
What's for sale, like a t-shirt?

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.520
Her hair, all of her hair.

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:02.520
I know, different copies of the book.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.520
I bought a bunch of postcards.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:07.520
I was really moved. I was the only one in our party that was super into it.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:10.520
There's beautiful, like little shampoo bottles shaped like Anne Frank.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.520
They're flashlights and blankets for hiding.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.520
See, when you connect the dots, that's when they boo.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.520
All right, Spencer, get us up to date.

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.520
All right.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:31.520
When we last met, our group had just split up.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.520
Mulraine flamed the scene to meditate at the sacred grove.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.520
Quark thrown onto the back of a deadly Candroid.

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:43.520
And Sharpie left to clean up the dead after the great battle of Buttsalot Camp.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.520
Quark infiltrated the great black ship of Dark Star's fleet,

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:51.520
checking out various rooms while Sharpie had the moment he'd always desired with his father.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:55.520
Reaching a new understanding, his father bestowed upon Sharpie the greatest gift of all.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.520
His magic cloak, the symbol of leadership of the Buttsalot Drive.

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.520
I'm sorry, can you pause there? I keep thinking about Adrienne in the back,

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.520
not knowing what the fuck's going on.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.520
Now I can't stop thinking about her point of view.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:12.520
She just came in and we're playing Dungeons & Dragons in front of her.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:15.520
I'm almost certain that she's going to be good with it then.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.520
Adrienne, are you on board?

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.520
I was told by the staff that she's the Adam Goldberg of this place.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.520
He becomes every chef.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.520
Adrienne, we're playing a make-believe game where...

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.520
I'm worried about what you said about fucking my mama from the distance.

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.520
She's the easiest and now I'm going to be embarrassed.

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.520
Oh no, we'll edit out where I fucked your mama.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.520
He's not really going to fuck your mama.

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:47.520
No, she's worried her mama will hear it and she'll...

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.520
She's cute. I mean, don't...

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.520
Oh, then I'll fuck her.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.520
We'll all fuck her.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.520
Okay, now we're going to fuck your mama.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.520
Now it's for real.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.520
I don't discriminate on mamas.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.520
Alright.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.520
Okay, Adrienne, Adrienne?

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.520
Alright, here we go.

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:17.520
No, I was concerned about her not having an eye into the...

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.520
Alright, sorry, Spencer, continue.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.520
Just making sure.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:24.520
Meanwhile, deep in meditation, Mulraine was disturbed by the sounds of a troubled horse.

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:28.520
Inspecting further, he discovered a dead woman wearing a belt of gender switching,

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.520
as well as a tight-up horse.

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:34.520
Mulraine put it on and regained her original, feminine form.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.520
Swiftly, she rode, rejoining Sharpie at Yellow Camp,

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.520
and together, with the magic of his father's cape, the two teleported,

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.520
rejoining Quark in the hold of the Black Ship,

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.520
just in time to hear the loud claxons of a warning alarm going off.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:50.520
Shit was about to go down.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.520
Go!

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.520
I was in a blackout drunk.

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.520
You put your magic cloak on, and you joined me on the ship.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.520
I'd been kicking some ass and killing some dudes with some cannons.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.520
Yellow creatures and some black creatures.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:11.520
Right, and I intimidated a black creature, and it was pretty cool.

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:17.520
And then you guys teleported up to join me on the mother ship, presumably of Admiral Darkstar.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.520
Both of us?

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.520
Yeah, you're both together. You were that fucked up?

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.520
I was that fucked up, dude.

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.520
You know I'm a woman now.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:28.520
I mean, you guys have no idea. This show is ten times better than Nashville.

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:33.520
They were having a better time, it sounded like, because they were fucked up, too.

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.520
You hear, like, oh, we're laughing, we're having a good time, but I'm telling you, I sound like a maniac.

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:45.520
That's why I came in here low-key and was like, you know, I wanted to, like, I wanted to mellow it out a little bit.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.520
Well, you've certainly done that.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.520
But then we ended up kickboxing with werewolves.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.520
Yeah, that's true.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:54.520
Alright, so I examine the surrounding Spencer.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:57.520
You're in a long room. Behind you stands a row of cannons.

01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:03.520
Their position is fixed, but the housing they're mounted on looks like it can be swung around 360 degrees.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.520
The alarm blares, and you know it's only a matter of time before someone comes to check it out.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:14.520
The remaining yellow demon is sliding across the floor towards a large yellow grate in the far wall.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.520
Turtle what?

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.520
A grate in the far wall. The door in front of you remains closed.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.520
Could I take the cannon and swivel it around and shoot the door?

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:24.520
Oh, totally.

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:29.520
Alright, I swivel the cannon. Stand back, everybody! I'm gonna blow the door open!

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.520
That's true, everybody.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.520
This is great.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.520
The door blasts open with a loud explosion.

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.520
You see the main room.

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.520
This room is covered in pipes, tubes, metal gauges, and all manner of valves and knobs.

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:51.520
Aside from the door you just came through, you see doors on your left and on your right,

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:54.520
and a large open hatch on the floor before you.

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:57.520
If you remember, Quark, that's how you got into this room.

01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.520
Alright, so I'm back where I came in.

01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:59.520
Yeah.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.520
Got it.

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.520
And so there's the two doors that I did not go through the first time.

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:07.520
The door to your right has a large sign in a language you can't read.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:10.520
Does anybody here have a power to read languages?

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.520
Can you tell us more about that language? Like, what does it look like?

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.520
I'll tell you it's a Bissell, and you recognize it as a Bissell.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.520
Like, so I can...

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:18.520
You speak a Bissell.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:19.520
I do?

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.520
Yeah.

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.520
Well, what does it say?

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.520
Uh, what does it say?

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.520
Bridge.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.520
Ooh.

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.520
It says bridge. It's written in a Bissell.

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:33.520
I say we go to the bridge and take this mother down.

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.520
Yeah, let's do it.

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.520
The door seems to be locked.

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.520
Sorry, I just did a quick walkie-talkie check.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.520
Switch the channel through, you guys.

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:53.520
The corridor that we're in is lined with doors on either side.

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.520
There's another door that, besides the one I mentioned,

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:59.520
and there's a hatch in the floor that would go down a floor.

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.520
Right, I try to open the other door.

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.520
The metal door opens with a whoosh,

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.520
and you can see a large pool of yellowy, liquid flesh swirling around.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.520
What is this?

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.520
Occasionally, you see a face contorted in agony,

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.520
drift up to the surface,

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.520
before giving a heart-sreaking wail

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.520
and sinking down to the bottom of the fluid.

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.520
This looks like a party we don't want to join, gentlemen.

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.520
You see several buttons on the far wall.

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.520
There's a grate on the floor, on the left side of the room,

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.520
and a small door to your right.

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.520
So there's a big puddle, a yellow flesh goo,

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.520
and a face occasionally is bubbling around in it?

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.520
Yep.

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.520
And there are buttons, and there's a grate.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.520
You see a coalescing figure.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.520
It's one of those yellow demons that rises out of the mush

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.520
and slides past it across the door.

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:52.520
It doesn't seem to be giving you any notice.

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.520
Creature!

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.520
Name yourself!

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:00.520
It doesn't seem to give you any notice.

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.520
What is it doing?

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.520
It just slid out of the room.

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.520
Oh, he's left?

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:07.520
Yep.

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.520
That was easy.

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.520
Did the buttons say anything?

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:15.520
The buttons aren't labeled.

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:16.520
There's five of them.

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.520
Are they different colors?

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.520
They are not.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.520
What color are they?

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.520
They're gray.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.520
Okay.

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.520
And there's a door to your right.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.520
Can I cast knock on it?

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:34.520
Isn't that like a spell that opens locked doors?

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.520
Yeah, knock is a spell that'll unlock any...

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.520
any locker, you know.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.520
Yeah, I see.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:42.520
If it's not magical.

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:45.520
You cast it, right?

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.520
Yeah, it casts knock like the dickens.

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:48.520
The door blasts open.

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.520
This hall is empty.

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.520
The human...

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:56.520
The human standing in front of a door down the hall.

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:59.520
At the sound of the knock spell, he takes notice of you.

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.520
The man is almost naked, wearing only an orange wrap around his waist

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.520
and holding a wicked looking metal whip.

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:08.520
He seems to be guarding something.

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:11.520
He cracks his whip with menace.

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.520
Drew is killing it.

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.520
So this guy looks like a bad guy, probably, right?

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.520
Combat is happening.

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.520
Combat is happening.

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.520
Whose turn is it?

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.520
The first person to react, I suppose.

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.520
I react with a power attack.

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:33.520
Charging through the door, you leap towards the foe with a power attack.

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.520
One, two, or three?

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:36.520
Two.

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.520
Two.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.520
You hit!

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:45.520
Striking the arm, holding the whip.

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.520
You're fl...

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.520
Fuck.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.520
Your sword cuts into his arm.

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.520
The man is almost felled.

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:58.520
He responds by snapping his whip at you.

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.520
It's a critical hit.

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:05.520
Thanks, Drew.

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:11.520
You take 18 damage and pull to your feet.

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:13.520
Fuckin' hell.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.520
So I'm down to... I've tried 40 hit points, so I'm done.

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:17.520
I'm done at 22?

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.520
Correct.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.520
Shitballs.

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.520
The man seems wounded.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.520
Do I still have my amulet of heal, thingy?

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:27.520
It's around your neck, yes, but it takes a while to boot up.

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:33.520
I hit control, alternate, delete, and reboot it.

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.520
It starts booting.

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:38.520
Sharpier, more rain.

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.520
I cast Charm Person on this googa.

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.520
You cast Charm Person.

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.520
He's entitled to a will-save.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.520
Shit, he's kicking ass.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.520
The Charm unaffects him.

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:50.520
It fails to affect him.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:58.520
I boldly and bravely shoot two arrows...

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.520
at the creature.

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.520
One of the arrows strikes him right in the neck.

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.520
Aha!

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:08.520
It does 10 damage.

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.520
He falls to the floor, bleeding out.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.520
He's dead.

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.520
He's dead?

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.520
We got him.

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.520
Aha!

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.520
Search him. Search his ass.

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:23.520
He's wearing an orange wrap and holding a wicked whip.

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.520
It might be magical.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:30.520
I hand the whip to Quirk, and I take off his orange wrap,

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.520
if only just to see his privates.

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.520
You feel better about yourself.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.520
I point at them and laugh.

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:42.520
It's hilarious.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:49.520
There's a door behind him.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.520
Yeah, there's a door behind him.

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:54.520
I wrap the orange wrap around me and go,

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.520
I'm a guy with a whip!

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.520
I'm dying!

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.520
You're a human. He was a human.

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:02.520
You should maybe put on the orange wrap,

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.520
take your shirt off and take the whip,

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.520
and you can go in and pretend you're that guy

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.520
and do a little switch around.

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:11.520
He just looks like a scrawny, pale human.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.520
So do I, right?

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.520
What's your strength?

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:16.520
What's your constitution?

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.520
You're pretty scrawny.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.520
My strength is 9, my constitution is 16.

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.520
I'd say you're a well-built chap.

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.520
So I don't look like this guy with my clothes off?

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:29.520
I mean, you look more like him than an elf or a gnome.

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.520
I say it's worth a try.

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.520
I'm going to assume, yeah, just what the hell, you know?

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.520
Yeah, I mean, what can't hurt?

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.520
I fold up my magic robes, put it inside his orange wrap,

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.520
wrap the orange wrap around me,

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:41.520
and then walk around with his dumb-ass whip.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.520
You make a passable disguise.

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.520
What's that?

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.520
You make a passable disguise.

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.520
You're not sure, but you're pretty sure it'll work.

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.520
My attraction lessons.

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:57.520
Standing at the door.

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:00.520
After you, Sharpie.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.520
I open the door.

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:04.520
This room is full of metal lockers.

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.520
They appear to be locked.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:09.520
You also see a large key ring on a small wooden table littered with maps.

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:11.520
Snatch.

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:16.520
He saved every one of us.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:17.520
I take the key ring.

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:18.520
What was the first thing you said?

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:19.520
This room is filled with what?

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:20.520
Lockers.

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:21.520
Metal lockers.

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:22.520
And maps on a table.

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:23.520
Let's get that key ring.

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.520
Hey, check out these maps.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:29.520
The maps depict the butt's expanse and the axe-beard mountains,

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:34.520
as well as a large land mass you're not familiar with.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:39.520
Where's the land mass in relation to the butt's butt's butt's butt's a lot?

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:40.520
It's in the water.

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:45.520
You can't see any other landmarks that you'd recognize on the map.

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:46.520
Take the keys.

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:49.520
I pick up the keys and try to...

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.520
Nice.

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:56.520
I jingle them around it just because I lock my Prius.

01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:01.520
And I go to try to open the lockers with the keys.

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.520
You unlock all the lockers.

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:04.520
What do you get?

01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:05.520
A loot of charming.

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.520
I'll take it.

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.520
A power bracelet.

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.520
Eight good arrows.

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:11.520
Eight sleep arrows.

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.520
Twenty V arrows.

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:14.520
A chime of opening.

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:16.520
Four beads of force.

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:20.520
And a quadringe and a pair of teeth.

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.520
May I have the arrows, gentlemen?

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:24.520
Of course.

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.520
Yeah, go ahead.

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.520
Thank you.

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.520
Thank you.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.520
Let me just pick these up slowly.

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.520
Arrow sound.

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:35.520
What was that?

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.520
Charm of opening?

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:37.520
What was that?

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.520
The chime of opening.

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:39.520
Chime of opening?

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:42.520
It's a small metal tube.

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.520
Right.

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:47.520
Is this like a dick joke?

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.520
No.

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.520
I should have went there.

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.520
It's just a small metal tube that opens things?

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.520
Okay.

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.520
There's a little tag tied to it.

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:56.520
A little tag?

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:57.520
To use.

01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.520
Ring this chime.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:21:59.520
Oh.

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.520
Okay.

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.520
It's a chime of opening.

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.520
Okay.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:04.520
All right.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.520
It probably works like my knock spell, right?

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:07.520
I don't know.

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.520
All right.

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:14.520
So we gather up all that booty and we probably take these maps.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.520
Are there other doorways in this room?

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:20.520
You see a hatch in the ceiling and there's no ladder leading up to it.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:24.520
However, a silver staff lies in the corner of the room.

01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:28.520
I approach the staff and grab the staff.

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:32.520
Grabbing the staff, you hold the staff.

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:43.520
Holding the staff, I use it to pivot my beautiful woman body up to the hatch.

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:49.520
As you strike this bottom of the rod against the floor, it begins to grow in length.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.520
Soon, the rod is at the top of the hatch.

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.520
Now, this is a dick joke, right?

01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.520
Yeah, it is.

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.520
I have the weirdest boner.

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:03.520
I stroke the staff to thank it.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:08.520
It pulses?

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.520
So can we climb that staff now to get up to the hatch?

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:13.520
You get the sense it would be easy to climb such a staff.

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:14.520
All right.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:15.520
I climb the staff.

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.520
We all climb the staff.

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.520
You all?

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.520
Yes, Adrienne.

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.520
Oh, shit.

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.520
It's all right.

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.520
Adrienne's got a question.

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:23.520
Okay.

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:26.520
I have a question.

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.520
I just got sleepy.

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:31.520
It's kind of hot in here.

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:34.520
Do you want to talk about something else?

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:43.520
Adrienne just gave a justifiable critique of how the evening's going.

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.520
Adrienne, what do you do?

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.520
What do you do, Adrienne?

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.520
Let's not talk about you.

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.520
That's not fair.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:24:00.520
If you're bored with us, I want to see you present something.

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:04.520
You just stretch out, Adrienne, do your thing.

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:09.520
I don't want to be a bitch, but I don't care how Adrienne feels.

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:16.520
I care how everyone else feels.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:19.520
Jesus Christ.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.520
I mean, but it is rude.

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.520
It's okay.

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.520
I'm sure you're a sweetheart.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.520
Maybe you're a little drunk, but it is a little rude.

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.520
It's okay.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.520
You're pretty.

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:30.520
Just fucking bury your prettiness and other things.

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.520
This is going wild.

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.520
Hitler died in this room.

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.520
It's fine.

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:37.520
I mean, I come up here and I just flounder and flounder.

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.520
I don't care about you disrespecting me.

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:41.520
I care about you disrespecting everybody else.

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.520
Okay.

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.520
Well, then just stop fucking talking.

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.520
Fine.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.520
You're going to be fine.

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.520
She's fine.

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:48.520
She's going to be fine.

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:49.520
I adore you.

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:50.520
You're going to be fine.

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.520
Just stop talking.

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.520
Do I have to make the sound effects?

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:54.520
Yes.

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.520
Yes.

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.520
Drew wants to know if they fight, should you make the sound effect?

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:00.520
Adrienne, we're climbing a magical staff into a different room.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:05.520
Which sounds very boring, but it's happening.

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:10.520
I'm so happy I'm here.

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:16.520
The American citizen guy with a completely foreign accent just expressed his total happiness

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:17.520
with being here.

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:18.520
What's your name again, sir?

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.520
Clayton.

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:20.520
Clayton?

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.520
Yeah.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:22.520
It's even a foreign name.

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.520
So British, or Australian, or...

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.520
Apparently, too.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:26.520
Is it Southern?

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:27.520
Yeah.

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:28.520
Where is Newcastle?

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:29.520
I still don't...

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.520
Is it Northern?

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:31.520
No.

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.520
You don't know?

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.520
I'm not good at geography.

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:34.520
Yeah, I know.

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:35.520
There's coal there, I think, right?

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.520
It's, yeah.

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:37.520
Yeah.

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:38.520
Yeah, beer and a soccer team.

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:39.520
All right.

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.520
We take a little break.

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.520
Let's wrap this adventure up with that.

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.520
Okay, so we'll leave that as a cliffhanger.

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.520
Thank you very much.

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.520
Okay.

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:46.520
Drew.

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:47.520
Thank you, everybody.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.520
Drew.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.520
Andrew.

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:54.520
Hitler's ghost, or the ghost of the Hans Hitler, Adrian, back there.

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:56.520
Thank you, Drew, on sound effects.

01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:57.520
Thank you, yeah.

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.520
Thank you, Spencer.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:25:59.520
Thank you, Erin McGathy.

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.520
I'm really looking for the bad.

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.520
Thank you.

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:02.520
Thank you.

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:03.520
A very angry Erin McGathy all of a sudden.

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.520
I really...

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.520
I'm trying to get the voice down.

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:07.520
Nice.

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:08.520
T-shirt.

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:11.520
Two for 25.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.640
She has some support from some parts of the room.

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:16.640
There's a Carolina conflict in here.

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.640
It's like, you know, when we grow up close to each other, we rub elbows.

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:25.640
The people that are closest to each other, Jeff, they can really hurt each other the

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:26.640
most.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.640
Yeah.

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:30.640
That's what we learned in North Carolina tonight.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.640
I forced it, but it's a lesson.

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:37.640
Now I think it's time for the...

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.640
It's time to find the best singers in the audience.

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:41.640
She can sing.

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:42.640
Yeah?

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:43.640
Yeah.

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:44.640
What's up?

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:45.640
What's your name?

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:46.640
I'm a tough guy.

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:47.640
What's your name?

01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:59.640
You don't have to sing well because you were the only...

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.640
Yeah, we really had to pull teeth to get...

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.640
Yeah, so you're in the clear.

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:04.640
You're fine.

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:05.640
Awesome.

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:09.640
Have you been listening to the podcast as we've been on the road?

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:10.640
I haven't, but I don't know the song.

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:11.640
Oh, okay.

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:12.640
All right.

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:13.640
It's really good, I think.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:14.640
Please.

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:15.640
Is there a melody?

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.640
Yeah, yeah.

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:17.640
It's like...

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:24.640
Come on down to Harmontown Turn that frown upside down

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:30.640
Pea is yellow, poop is brown Come on down to Harmontown

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:31.640
I think you got it.

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:32.640
Something like that, right?

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:33.640
Yeah.

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:34.640
All right.

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:35.640
I'll help you out with the first one.

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:37.640
And if anyone else knows it out there, please join it.

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:38.640
All right.

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:39.640
Who knows it, right?

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:40.640
All right.

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:41.640
Clayton, you know it, right?

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:42.640
Yeah.

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:43.640
Yeah.

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:44.640
Yeah.

Yeah.

01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:48.640
Yeah.

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:54.640
North Carolina came to the stage, got a lot of drunken ladies expressing rage, got people

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.640
turning against each other for no reason.

01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:59.640
I fucked your mama every year and every season.

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:02.640
I put some salt on her pussy, pepper on her nuts.

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:05.640
I fucked your mama in seven of her butts.

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:08.640
She's got seven butts because she's a mythical creature.

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:11.640
I fucked your mama like the Hobbit feature.

01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:13.640
It's three movies.

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:14.640
Why?

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:15.640
It was one book.

01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:16.640
I fucked your mama.

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:17.640
Don't even look.

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:18.640
Turn your head.

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.640
Well, I fucked her dead.

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.640
I fucked your mama.

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:23.640
I'm sorry.

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:24.640
Your dad instead.

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:25.640
I fucked your dad.

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:26.640
A nuzzle does nuts.

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:29.640
I fucked your dad in all of his butts.

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:30.640
Do it.

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:36.640
Come on down to Harmontown Turn that frown upside down

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:39.640
Drink, eat his yellow, poop his brown.

01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:44.640
Come on down to Harmontown Urban plight, feeling my eyes.

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:47.640
My mind goes across the horizon, surprise.

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:50.640
I got concrete jungle, graffiti in my veins.

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.640
Motherfucker, gonna go in the rain.

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:56.640
I got pylons and storm drains.

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:59.640
Got your mama in the fucking lanes.

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:02.640
I tried to pass her, but her ass was too big.

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.640
I fucked your mama.

01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:05.640
She's a Newton, a fig.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.640
A fig Newton is what I meant.

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.640
I fucked your mama so hard, she put it into the cement pocket.

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:18.640
Come on down to Harmontown Turn that frown upside down

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:21.640

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:26.640
Adrienne in the back, hoppin' off.

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.640
Does she have a right?

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.640
Do you have a right to cough?

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:33.640
If someone sneezes, do you say gazoon tight?

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:36.640
I said some shit, but Erin wasn't alright.

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.640
She said shut the fuck up.

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.640
She said I could talk.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:42.640
If I can do this, then anyone can speak and walk.

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:43.640
I walk around the room.

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:45.640
Your mama's got a womb.

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:48.640
I'm back inside it and it's gonna be my tomb, Hitler.

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:54.640
Come on down to Harmontown Turn that frown upside down

Put her in a dungeon key

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.640
I took my shoes off and hit her in the face

01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:12.640
I fucked your mama regardless of her race

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:14.640
I went to the moon and colonized it

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:17.640
I took your mama outside and squeezed both of her tits

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.640
Had some milk come out, put it all in my coffee

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:25.640
I said hey bitch, you turned me off with me

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:28.640
And then I started to save other shit

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:33.640
It didn't really matter because it had been a long night

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:36.640
I fucked your mama alright

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:39.640
Come on down to Harmontown

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:42.640

He is yellow, poop his brown

01:30:57.640 --> 01:31:00.640
Come on down to Harmontown

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:02.640

I just wanna stroke it, be gentle and kind

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:11.640
I want all of my brothers to hit, pause and rewind

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:14.640
And go back to a time when we can love each other

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:17.640
Don't want Caroline and brothers to fight

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:20.640
All the mountains are the same out our window

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:22.640
I fucked your mama

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.640
It's okay, see?

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:25.640
Oh shit

01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:27.640
It's Adrienne

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:31.640
I found Adrienne crying in the bathroom

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:36.640
Explain to her what happened

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:38.640
We'll say it in front of you

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:40.640
I'm sorry I made you feel bad

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.640
It's okay, apology accepted

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:46.640

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:50.640
Women hugging, everyone loving

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:55.640
Go out to your cars, put the tires as a nugget

01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:58.640
I don't know about automotive terminology

01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:03.640
Starting over

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:06.640
Fucked your mama like her name was Rover

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:09.640
Turned her to sit down and roll

01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:11.640
Fucked your mama in a Gallipol

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.640
I said

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:14.640
What do you think?

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:16.640
She said, I'm a Democrat

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:18.640
I put her ass in the kitchen sink

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.640
And put it in a cup

01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:22.640
But fuck your mama so hard

01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:24.640
She got all fucked up

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:26.640
She was crying the next day

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:28.640
I said, why? She said, I love you

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.640
You're my special guy

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:33.640

01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:36.640
I'm just trying to wrap I get so abusive

01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.640

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:43.640
