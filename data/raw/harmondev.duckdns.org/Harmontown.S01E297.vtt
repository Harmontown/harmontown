WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Yeah!

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
Make some noise for yourself for coming into downtown Los Angeles.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session. How are you tonight?

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
You look so much better than that. How are you tonight?

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Yeah!

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
Let me bring to the stage the master king of all he surveys.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
It's a gamer king, Spencer Crittenden.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
Yeah!

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Couldn't do a show without him. Lord knows he needs to hear you.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Give him some claps when he gets out here.

00:46.000 --> 00:56.000
Ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
I am Brandon Jackson.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah, wrap to the east, wrap to the west, wrap to your knees, wrap to your chest, wrap to your feet, wrap to your shoes, wrap to the rhythm, and the news.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
What?

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
You thought I was going to say blues, but I mixed it up. Ain't it the same thing, Dan?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
No.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
That was just me realizing how offbeat I was the whole time.

01:19.000 --> 01:32.000
Like, no. Okay. Thank you for coming.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
All right, well.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Let's get down.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah. Not a lot to share. I don't know.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
It's been working hard. You know, it's fun.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Yeah, you're back, back, back. Right?

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
What week is this? Is this like four weeks in of Rick and Morty?

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
It's a little more than that, but now it's like really like in stage of like, oh, it's good to be back to work.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
But now it's really like, I mean, we're, we're, things are running like a fucking machine.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Yeah.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm not going to lie. It is a new thing for me.

02:02.000 --> 02:10.000
Like, I, like, it's, it's just, it really is continuing to be this thing where I'm like, are you going to fuck this up?

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Like, it's up to you to fuck this up.

02:12.000 --> 02:24.000
Like, just like what, and that's when your religion comes into it. You're like, do I believe that the universe is structured in a way that if everything is going okay for a week that it has to go to fucking shit and get all fucked up?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Like, you either have to believe that.

02:27.000 --> 02:36.000
And it's like, like, is it okay to just be like, well, maybe, maybe your definition of things getting fucked up will elevate or something.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
I don't know.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Yes.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
I haven't figured it out.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Higher end fucking up.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
And I do know that it's not, it's not, it's not supposed to be you.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
If you have, if you have no shoes for a week, I'm going to riff a metaphor.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
It's going to go good.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
It's going to, I'm going to nail this.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
You have no shoes for a week.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
And then you're like, this is pretty fucked up, but it's normal.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
So during that week, you're like, I got no shoes and Maggie likes me.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
And she's like, hi, Lloyd.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
And you're like, no shoes, Lloyd.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
That's what they call me.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
We don't have really caveman names.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Who said we were cavemen?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
What kind of image?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Just because I have no shoes.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
There's lots of people that don't have them.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Maybe we're in a weird country.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
A weird country.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Our names are Maggie and Lloyd.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Can we not get into this, Maggie?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
You fucking bitch.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
You have to pick everything apart and problematize it.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I got no shoes.

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
And so then you go home and go, you say to your living girlfriend who always knew Maggie

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
was probably an issue, but also you guys have an understanding because you knew it was like

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
you moved in actually more out of convenience.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
And so anyways, you're not dishonest.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
But she's like, how was your day?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Like shitty, gotten a little tussle.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
What was it, Maggie?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Because you want to fuck her?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
No.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
And I got no shoes.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
And then she's like, this is starting about names.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
And you're like, so you had a bad week, right?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
And you go like, OK, I had a bad week.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
No shoes guy had a bad week.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
OK.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
I think this metaphor is still going to work.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
You got this.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
So then the next week you wake up.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
There's shoes.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
Let's say you have a caveman holiday called Shoemus.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
All the cavemen get shoes.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
No, correction.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
None of the cavemen get shoes.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Most of them get a BB gun.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
You get shoes.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
You know why?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Because you're a good caveman.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
You did your fucking time.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
You deserve shoes.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
What are you going to do with a BB gun?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
There's mammoth out there.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I know my history.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
I know my anthropology.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Don't fuck with me.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
So you put on the shoes.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Now you're fucking rolling.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
These are the Tesla of cavemen shoes.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Yes.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
And you're like, wow, feels good.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Like rattlesnakes can't bite me.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Sabertooth tigers can't outrun me.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
OK.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
I'm sure they can outrun me.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
That's how you know why.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
You know what?

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
I don't owe you this explanation, but I'll say this.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
90% of sabertooth tiger deaths happen because the caveman

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
in the midst of creeping by the sabertooth tiger,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
went ow, because he stepped on a sharp stone.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
That's a fact.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
So shoes means life.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
It means you're lucky.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
You're privileged.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I had no shoes.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I was, what was my name?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Lloyd?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Yep.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
The caveman.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
I now have shoes.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
So if Lloyd starts to think, OK, now I got shoes.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
So now that means, right, that I'm going to get caveman cancer.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
That doesn't do anybody any good.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
That's not a good thing for him to think.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
That's not even his expertise.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
We'd rather him think about other things.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Like the light bulb hasn't been invented.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
You're saying when Lloyd had no shoes, his fear was the tiger,

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
the sabertooth.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
But then when Lloyd got shoes, his new fear was cancer.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Yeah.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Caveman cancer.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
And I think, you know, look, I am the first person to agree

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
that Lloyd's podcast is going to get a little less entertaining.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
Once he stops going to the ins and outs of his fear of sabertooth tigers.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
I do agree that that was a big part of the appeal.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
But, you know, assuming the podcasts aren't what keep us happy and alive.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
Like, you shouldn't be like, oh, God, a cave anvil is going to fall on my head.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
That's what, but Lloyd lived with a girlfriend.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Well, that sounds like a happy relationship.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
What do they mean they're living together, but they're what?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
What?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Come on.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
That sounded like they needed to take that to a cave couple therapist.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
Perhaps perhaps the thing that will keep Lloyd from worrying about cancer is the fact

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
that he's got people around him who are also worried.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Oh, wait.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Oh, you that was a left turn.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Okay.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
That was a left turn.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
I thought I was going to say blue.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Did you?

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
To take his shoes and run as far away that he had to go to a place where there's no tigers

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
or people and just be in a field and like lay down and die from sleeping too much.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
And make great television.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
That's always been a part of it.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
And I have never, ever, ever said like, I've never, look, I've been doing this for 20 years.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
I have never made the television.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I make part of anyone's problem.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
I've never done that.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
Like I, I, I, I, you find me an episode of a TV thing I produce where it's like, oh,

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
I can see someone's upset about Twinkies.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
You know, I don't, I don't fucking, that's to hack shit.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
I don't fucking like blow your mind.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
I tell you timeless stories about struggles and humanity.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Shoes.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
I use these great metaphors to like reveal things about.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I don't even remember where I'm going.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
I'm trying to, I'm just saying this is part, part three.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
I think since, since I revealed that I'm too happy.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
It's a problem.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Okay.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
But you're getting, here's the good thing about getting happy is you're getting happier

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
as your problem grows.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Well, I'm excited to talk about it.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Because it feels like also in your therapist goes, you need to learn how to be happy.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
You're like, you mean brag?

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
Because I was told that's how you get cancer.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
And she's like, no, that's not how you get cancer.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
Do you mean like Jack Ruby comes to the prison and like, or wait, no, Jack Ruby got injected

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
with cancer, right?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Because he, Kennedy.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Okay.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Do you think you're going to win?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Jack Ruby?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Do you think you're going to win the happiness battle?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Because it sounds like.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
No.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Because you know what, you know what, I have a feeling, you know what I think is going

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
to happen?

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
I think my body is going to start dying.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
And we'll dress it up.

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
We'll call it a stroke or a, or a lung collapse or a, or a gout.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Right.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
And then, oh, and then everybody would go, oh, he's dying.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
And then I'll go, oh, don't worry about me.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I lived a good life.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Why are you all talking like that?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
I don't know.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Because, you know, I don't want to, I don't want to mock it.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
I said, you're home, I want you to drink my flowers.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I heard you were dying.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Don't you think winning is, I guess I, I guess I'm like nine years old.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Like, don't you think winning is like, you don't die?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
That's what, like, that's every game you play.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Like tag, you're it.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
You lost.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Tag, I'm never it.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I won forever.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
So if you play hide-and-seek and you stick yourself into a storm drain,

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
it doesn't matter if snails are crawling over your face, you won hide-and-seek.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
But you lost it life.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
Well, tell that to the person who said life was about being sought.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
Tell that to Professor Seekman and his fucking model of the universe.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
I just want to see you coming out from under a bush with slugs on your face going, I won!

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh man, I was the king of that shit.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Like, they play flashlight tag.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
I'm like, I will go where no light will go.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
See, it's easy for you to brag.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
See, it's easy for you to crash in my lungs and a smile on my face.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
We won flashlight tag and we lost.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
We sure did, buddy, we sure did.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
You hid somewhere, some people were afraid to shine a flashlight.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
Congratulations, the joke's on you, everyone just wants to stop playing.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
There's girls here.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah, I would hide.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
I knew how to hide.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
We talked about this.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
You guys think when you're kid, you're not claustrophobic, right?

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
We used to hide in fucking weird cupboards and shit.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
We'd be like, the weirder the better.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
You'd tuck your leg and be like, man, I wish I could lock this from the outside

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
so that nobody would swallow the key.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Because your instinct is to never be found.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
And I think it's because you're a kid and you don't know that that's a coffin.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
Like, you're at a certain age, I'm going to say like 17 or something.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
You're not quite like gripping mortality, but you watch your first serpent in the rainbow kind of movie

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
and you're like, how come that guy's going like this and screaming inside of the coffin?

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
And then that forces you to go, well, I'm going to have to decode why this character's acting like this.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
All right, I'm in a box.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
I can't get out.

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
There's nothing but, oh, God, oh, Jesus, God, oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, God, being buried alive, oh, my God.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
We all end up dead.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Oh, my God, being unable to move.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
I got to a point.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Dan's grabbing his sunglasses.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
We do a podcast part two.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
You say that they're $300?

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Oh, they're $300.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Dan threw them into the ice.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I bought them on New Year's Eve.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
I was already high.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
The store wasn't open late.

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
The sun was out, obviously, or I wouldn't...

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
But I was like, I'm high.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
That was a good day.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I like New Year's Eve.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
You started it out getting high and then were like, I'm so high I should get some sunglasses.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
Yeah, I went to Fred Siegel with my girlfriend and I was like, let's get some crazy shit for tonight.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
And then I was like, how about some sunglasses?

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Yeah, but what about being rich?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And I was like, what if they were $300?

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
And I was like, maybe I'll wear them again.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
My $1,000 glasses that helped me see because those are gone.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
I don't know where those are.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
I lost those.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Yeah.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
That's not your problem.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Well, it's hard.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I don't know.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
That's why I wore my glasses all the time.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
I was supposed to just wear them while I was driving.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
But then it's like, you have to carry a case or some shit.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
And it's like, well, I'm not going to do any of this.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
I don't understand, I know the answer is 100%.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
I'm not going to ask how many of my audience wears glasses.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I know it's 100%.

12:39.000 --> 12:48.000
But of you, let's say by applause, how many of you walk around with a case for your glasses?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Yeah, that's a lot.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
That feels healthy.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
I don't think all of those people are serial killers.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
That's good moral applause.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
I understand.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
I lost $1,000.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
I went and got things that cost $1,000.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
And I treat them like they're garbage, but they're not.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
They're $1,000.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
It's almost like the case makes them harder.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
You're just doing it to make them bulkier so that you don't lose them.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
But yeah, I mean, that's so you could put it in your pocket or whatever.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
But I'm never going to do anything like that.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
So it's just like holding a small log or something.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
It's done.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I just feel like an asshole.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
Just figure this shit out or do they, they're rich and we can't see.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Yeah.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
They got us right where they want us.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
Our next guest is we want it by popular demand.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
A lot of people said last episode, they're like, Dan, that was amazing.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Wow.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
Just amazing and wow.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Awesome.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Where were you by the way?

13:52.000 --> 13:58.000
Do you understand that every time you're not here fucking Schrab is out of control?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Is that true?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Yeah.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Did you listen to it?

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
Like he just like, he can't, I'll be, I'll be like, you know what's crazy about mortality

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
is like, mortality.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
And I just like, like, you need that.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
I can't compete with that.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
And then they're all like, he's great.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
And like, I can't argue with that.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I'm a bad guy.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
But then I'm like, what was the quintessential one?

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
I was like, I was like, oh, do you think about death as a human?

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
And he's like, as a human, you're not, you're not an animal.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
You're a human.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
And he just went off for like, you know how he does that thing where it doesn't, you

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
know, it doesn't, he doesn't wait to see if it worked or not.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
He like, he just, he just leans in and that's why it works.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Yeah.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Yeah.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Because if he did it and it didn't work and then he leaned in, you'd be like, no sale.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
But he just fucking leans in.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
He's like, he's like, you go, hey, do you understand?

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
As opposed to over sit, as opposed to over sit, as opposed to over sit.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Understand?

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
Not over sit, over sit, over sit, as opposed to over sit.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
You said understand, but did you say over sit?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
See, it worked on you.

15:11.000 --> 15:20.000
But now, now try this one.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Hey, do you understand?

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
You mean as opposed to over sit?

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
Well, you're laughing because of, you're laughing at the fact that I nailed it.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
My point.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Anyways.

15:31.000 --> 15:38.000
All right.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
All right.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Well, let's bring out the kid from the alley from last week is what I was talking about.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Mr. Jeff Davis is here.

15:46.000 --> 15:56.000
Yes.

15:56.000 --> 16:18.000
Jeff Davis, ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Davis.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Oh, no.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I thought you were going to bring out a trap.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
No, because that wouldn't have worked.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
See, I'm a craftsman.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
I don't care.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Like I'm helping him.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
I'm like, what would help Schrab in terms of timing?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Like, I was like, well, don't do that.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
And then he did that.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I was like, well, let's buffer it.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
I had some work done.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
I had a cool ectomy.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
And I don't want, it hasn't, it's.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
You took the cool out of yourself?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Yeah.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
So I'm, so I don't know why I would just mitigate it.

16:52.000 --> 17:03.000
I told the story on this podcast of like, I had a therapist and

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
and I was telling, I know I told this, but then she, I was like talking about my childhood

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
and then I looked up and she had like tears coming down her face.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
I was like, why are you crying?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
She's like, well, it's a very emotional story.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
I'm like, no, it's not.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
It's not.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Like, and I'm not being a cling on.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I'm like, I'll tell you what's emotional.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
I'm a fucking professional storyteller.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
And, and she's like, well, maybe not to you.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Professional therapist.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
I know, I think I know what's powerful.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
And I was like, all right, well, see you again.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Same time next week.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
I came back next time and she was like, well, how's your thing with your sled?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
No, that's great.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
It says Rosebud on it.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
It was going through.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
I don't, I'm making up that making up a therapy session.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
What if, what if, what if in Citizen Kane, he just had a therapist?

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
Like in the middle of the movie, he's just like, I had this sled as Rosebud.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
And she's like, well, see, it's like, you know what?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
I'm going to go home to my wife.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Tell her it's okay for her to go out.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
She was crying for less than honest reasons.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
So then she, yeah.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
And so she goes like, by the way, really embarrassed about this.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
You asked about the tears coming down my face.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
I had had some work done and I was embarrassed because it's a vanity thing.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
So I lied in the moment and I feel bad about that.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
And I said, well, I probably didn't say, but I said,

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
I said the way we say in our heads when we're just,

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
when we're just going to walk away and never go back.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
You mean you were like?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Yeah.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
I was, I was like.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
You were all like.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
I'm pretty sure.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Were you all like or were you just like?

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
I think I was, I think I was nothing like because I think I was like,

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
okay, sure.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
And just never went back.

18:36.000 --> 18:43.000
But I'm like, you mean you more importantly, you like, like I said,

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
why are you crying?

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
And you're like specifically because of the emotional quality of the story,

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
you pay me to listen to and understand and analyze.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Like that's fucked up.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Yeah.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Like lying is, if your plumber comes over and he's like, oh,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
it looks like you took a big shit and you're like, don't judge.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
And he's like, I won't.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
I'm a plumber.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I'm just going to get the shit out and you give me 50 bucks and I'll be gone.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
I'm sorry to offend plumbers.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
I don't mean to make your occupation sound cheap or fucking craftless.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
I know it's hard.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
But I was in Boston.

19:13.000 --> 19:22.000
And, but while he's doing it, if he's like, and you're like, hey,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
plumber, why are you crying?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
And he's like, nothing.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
And you're like, well, okay, but it's fucked up.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
If he goes, just your shit stinks.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
That's fucked up.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
He doesn't have to do that.

19:39.000 --> 19:48.000
I would say I watched roots last night.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
And then to come back a week later to fix your sink and be like,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
you shit didn't stink that bad.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
I just had had some work done.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
And that one place, maybe I'd be like, well, that's a pretty honest plumber.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
Like you didn't have to, you could have, because all shit stinks.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I'd be like, okay, that's cool.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
He's been punching everything, but the therapy then,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
that's where the metaphor breaks down.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Did you keep her?

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
No.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Oh good.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Okay.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
No, nor did I, like, you know, say, I'm firing you because, like,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I just didn't show up.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
That's what I do with all my therapists is like, I'm just didn't know I can show up.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
How's your current therapist's relationship going right now?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Fantastic.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Yeah.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
So good.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
You guys get along?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
I mean, get along? No, fuck that.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
She's just fucking good.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Did Rocky get along with Burgess Meredith?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Yes.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
No, he made him chase a chicken.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
That's not what a friend does.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
He told him he was going to eat lightning and shit thunder.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Yeah, but he told him that from out of a moving car

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
that he was making him chase.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Like, it's not a friendship.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
It's more valuable than that.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
You're going to do great, kid.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Come on, you're a bum. I'm not a bum.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
Friendship is for pussies.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Has your therapist ever told you that you might get murdered to death?

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
No.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
By Mr. T.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
That's Rocky, too.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
No, but my therapist told me I have a 50% chance of suicide given my...

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
Right, and tonight you said you weren't going to learn how to be happy,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
which was the other alternative, right?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Wait, no. Did I say that? I didn't say that.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I thought you said you weren't going to find out how to be happy.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Who says that? That's crazy.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
So that's why I clocked it.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
I was like, write this down and don't, like, follow up on this.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
Yeah, I don't... I mean, I didn't mean to say...

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Good, because don't die.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
We don't give Spencer that fancy of desks to not remember things.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Right.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
Ask yourself if I've ever done anything cool

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
and before you worry if I'm just going to kill myself without any...

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
You're not going to kill yourself.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
No, I'm not worried about that.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
That isn't cool. What I mean is, have I ever done anything restrained

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
or, like, you know, like, I don't know what I'm going to do next week?

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I'm going to kill myself.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
Like, I'm not capable of that level of...

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
You're not going to kill yourself. You're going to get killed by the alt-right.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
And we all know that.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Spencer's desk is backwards.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Yeah, it's this...

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
We've discussed this.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
Tell me, because this looks like a backwards desk.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
Yeah, but that's the whole point, right?

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Well, think of it this way.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
What do you think is behind, like, on the back of this desk?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Drawers.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Well, what do you think is on the front?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Fake drawers.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
No, he's saying...

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
You think there's drawers on both sides?

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
No, I think there's real drawers in the back where you are.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
I think there's fake drawers on the front.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Well, that's where you're...

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Well, that's where you're wrong.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Oh, shit!

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Wait, what? Why is there...

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Now get ready to have your mind really blown.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Oh, shit.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
Jeff, I think there's fake drawers on the back.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
What?

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
This is just like...

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
Oh, man, this is just like the Neil Patrick Harris Oscars or whatever.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Do you guys remember that?

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
And everyone's like, how did they know when they pre-planned the whole show

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
what would happen on the show?

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
This could never happen.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
How could all these actors do pre-scripted things?

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
On camera.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
This is magic.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
And I was like, why is anyone impressed?

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
And people are like, what the fuck are you talking about?

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
And I was like, you don't see what's happening?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Acting.

23:46.000 --> 23:58.000
Okay, that's been building for years.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
I'm just so glad that you said it inside this time.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Not out in the street like the first time.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
No, I know.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
He closed his own drawers.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
I like our audience because what they applied is the confessional

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
that's been building for years.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
A lesser podcast, they've just been plotting after the rant about the thing.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
But then they liked that and then they waited and he said,

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
that's been building for years and they said, they love you.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
I like them.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Well, okay, and they don't like being praised, fuck you.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I like that too.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
Maybe this is a bad thing to back-control on.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
We haven't brought up an audience member out of the audience on stage in a long time.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
Someone gasped at that.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Probably the worst guest we could ever...

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Don't you think?

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
Because don't you think it's usually good if somebody's like,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
oh, my dad died and I did this, but somebody that's like,

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
I was just saying.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
There's a good chance that person is...

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Is it Adam Goldberg?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
No.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
No, no, it didn't mean that.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
But don't you...

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
What about Schrab?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
What about Schrab?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Oh, shit.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
Rob Schrab!

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Watch it once.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Rob Schrab.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Rob Schrab.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Oh, shit.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Rob Schrab.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Oh, yeah.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Rob Schrab.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Rob Schrab.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Rob Schrab.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Rob Schrab.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Rob Schrab.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Rob Schrab.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
What if Schrab was one of us?

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
That's an obligated visual dip.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
Hard to describe.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Steve Levy in Two Doors.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
Really, really taking me to task earlier.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
I might have deconstructed you a little bit.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
That's all I do is just say things loud.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
I didn't say that.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
I didn't say that.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Did you guys hear how strong my voice was just now

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
when I saw Rob Schrab?

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
I was so worried.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I was like, you can't be doing this, man.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
No, I'm allowed to have a strong voice

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
until I feel like I'm tired.

26:08.000 --> 26:15.000
I'm fucking back.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Well, Levy, can we...

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
Levy, can we get Schrab a sarcastically comfortable

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
easy chair for next week?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
So he can just be my dad.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
The journey can be complete.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
We should have just a bark-a-lounger out here for him.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
Can we just then show you Mel Brooks movies

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
throughout my podcast?

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
And you can just go,

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
Now that's funny.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
I'll do that.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
I'll do that.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Oh, look at this.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Thank you.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
That looks great.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
So let's compare.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
Is this better or worse than the last chair?

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
I'm going to say better.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
Because my feet are on the floor.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
And you're reaching for the stars.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
This could be fun later on in the show.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
This little crack here.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
Looks like it's half-built.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
I think my phone's going to go dead.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
Oh, no.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Now what?

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Now what?

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
The show.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
But with the show.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Quick hurry.

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
Do the show before it runs out.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I'm going to do it now, don't I?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
I just wanted to share that my dad

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
remembered the dad-fished episode.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I texted my dad during the show

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
because everyone's like,

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Oh, yeah.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
He did text back.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
And I wanted to, what did he say?

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
Do it in his voice.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
Now, is this your actual dad that texted you?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Yes.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Because you didn't change Heath back, right?

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
Monday, July 16th, 8.51 p.m.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I was here with you.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
You made me text my dad.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Because apparently the following exchange

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
was standing between me and emotional fulfillment.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
I said, my show got nominated for an Emmy exclamation point.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
And Tuesday, July 17th, he texted back,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Fucking fantastic.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Yeah.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Yeah.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Yeah.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Yeah.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Yeah.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Yeah.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Yeah.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Yeah.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Yeah.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
You're healed.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Yeah.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Did he say, what else is new?

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
No.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
Well, I mean, let's not put, you know, like, let's not,

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
I like, he doesn't have to do more than that.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
No, no.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
No.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
You know.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
My parents don't pick up.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Did you have more of a conversation after that?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Like, did you guys?

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
No.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
Well, because, you know, I put out a little,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Emmy, fantastic.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
And you, what am I supposed to be like?

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
How's the garden?

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Yeah.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
Why not use that as a way to open up a little dialogue

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
between you and your son?

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
It's only if you want the conversation to continue.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Yeah.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
I don't care about gardens.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Not Emmy worthy.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
But what about?

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Okay.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
No, I thought that would get a laugh.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
What?

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Your dad opened up a dialogue.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
He didn't open up a dialogue.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
I did.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
But he furthered it.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
He, he kicked that soccer ball back into play.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Oh, oh, oh, I see what you're saying.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
So this would just continue forever.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Text your dad.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Text your dad.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
Oh, so fun to be part of an emotional epiphany.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Oh, goodwill hunting.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Text your dad.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Hey dad.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Yay.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
We affected something.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Hey dad, this happened.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Good.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Text him more.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Text him more.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
And forever.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
Fuck people.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Give me an Emmy.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Don't applaud that.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Yeah.

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
Don't shit take people's instructions on when to applaud.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
What did I tell you?

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
That is a bull shit.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Don't applaud that.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
You're, you're a flat.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Well, okay.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
We'll talk.

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
Your father who is as emotionally estranged as you are.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Emotionally estranged.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Yeah.

30:18.000 --> 30:24.000
Well, you, you can hold his hand if you want.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
He was mocking you.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
You said problem.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Earlier.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
When there are two, my role changes.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
He speaketh.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
I cosineeth.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
But your dad, your dad said hip hip hooray and you said nothing back.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
That's, that's the end of that.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
No.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
Well, his dad, a normal dad would say hip hip hooray.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Right.

30:47.000 --> 30:53.000
But a, but a cool ponytail dad said, fucking fantastic.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Read a cool thing.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Yeah.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
And so what?

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
It's really surprising.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
How are we trying to spin this into me continuing to be with the old roof withholding guy?

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
It's playing catch.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
It's not going to work.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
It's playing catch with words, Dan.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
It's what you've always wanted.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
All right.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Okay.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
All right.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
All right.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
How about this?

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Well, every night of the week, I'll fucking text my dad.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Oh, wow.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Yeah.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Text him right now.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
Tell him to see, tell him to see Mission Impossible fallout.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
It's supposed to be great.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Yeah.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Tell him to see fallout.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
It's supposed to be great.

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
Have you seen Mission Impossible?

31:30.000 --> 31:36.000
Now, where does the colon go in a title like that?

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Mission colon impossible.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Am I right?

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
I think.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Yeah, you're right.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
Yeah.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Mission colon impossible.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Oh no, no, no.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Mission impossible colon fallout.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Mission, the mission is impossible.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
It's clearly mission colon impossible.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
The colon is baked into the original title.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Okay.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
All right.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Just tell your father you love him, Dan.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
Tell your father you love him, Dan.

31:59.000 --> 32:05.000
Tell him.

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
I prefer to go with a more possible mission.

32:10.000 --> 32:15.000
Have you seen Mission colon impossible colon fallout?

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
This is.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
Peach with ghost protocol.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
As far as I'm concerned.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
It's supposed to be, it's supposed to be really good.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
I haven't seen it.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Well, he's going to ask why I'm asking.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
And the answer is because it's nice to hear from you, Dad.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
I appreciate the.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Oh, you can tell.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Is that what you want me to text?

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
The connection.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
It's nice to hear from you, Dad.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
I appreciate the connection.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
Can we, now that you have given him some information about yourself,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
can we maybe ask about him?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Ask him a question.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Thank you, Brandon.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
What should I ask him?

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
You should ask him if you've seen.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
How's your.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Have you seen mission?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Did you hear?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
You should say.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
Did you hear about these nuts in this Emmy nomination?

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Oh, no, I already come on.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
You're trying to trick me.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
No, no, no, really.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
Maybe you should say, maybe you should ask him what he's been up to.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
What have you been up to?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Oh, yeah.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I miss you, father.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
What?

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
What have you been up to?

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
Question mark, and that ends that segment.

33:16.000 --> 33:22.000
Everyone backseat drives my fucking relationship with my father.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
In spite of me giving you complete fucking control over it,

33:26.000 --> 33:32.000
you will never learn the lesson that the road leads nowhere.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
I think it's fun.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
Drive it off a cliff.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
I don't fucking care.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Thelma and Louise, my life.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
He pieces of shit.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
Maybe love grows on trees where you live.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Don't fucking bully me.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
All right.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
All right.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Everybody's a piece of shit.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
I can turn off my fucking feelings like a light.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Oh, God.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
No, Collins.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
I don't think two women driving a car off a cliff to commit suicide.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
It's exactly the same.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
It's the same as saying, hi, dad.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
It is exactly the same.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
It's not the same.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
Don't you ever try to take that away from me or my gender?

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Don't do it.

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
Here's something I haven't ever seen long his good night.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
And I just watched it recently.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Pretty good.

34:13.000 --> 34:23.000
Let's do a scene from it.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
The long kiss good night.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Hey, what are you doing?

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Hey, what are you doing?

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
Hey, hey, hey, how'd you get it?

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Hey, what are you doing?

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Oh, God.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Oh, God.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Oh, God.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Oh, God.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Oh, yeah.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
It flies backwards.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
And out of the story.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
That was a long kiss.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
Good night.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I have to rewatch that movie.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
It's pretty good.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
I think it might be Dutch.

35:00.000 --> 35:08.000
I don't remember that much Nospiratu in it.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
Have you seen the Franklin Jell-O Dracula?

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Not for a long time.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Let's see a scene from that one.

35:14.000 --> 35:22.000
Let's see a scene from Franklin Jell-O Dracula.

35:22.000 --> 35:28.000
Oh, a wolf man.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
But you have to mention the camera.

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
20% of the movie is a camera facing down the side of a building

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
with Franklin Jell-O moving his hands,

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
green screaming up the side of a building.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
He's either coming for Renford,

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
he's coming for Lucy,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
he's coming for Free Pretzels,

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
he'll Spider-Man.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
That movie should have been called Spider-Man.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Renford.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Renford?

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
What's his name?

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM.

36:01.000 --> 36:08.000
Oh shit, hey, hey, what are you doing up there, what are you doing?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Sanford, you will obey me.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
No, no, I'm Renford.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
Oh, oh, I'm going, I'm going.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
You have no faith Sanford.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
You eat that cockroach.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
I'm eating that cockroach.

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
I expected you to be harder to command.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
You are known for your fortitude.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
That's some lazy improv, I just kind of go, eh, fuck it.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
That was Renford and son.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Renford.

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
You like that, that Trob Nile, just like, uh, Sanford.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
No, I was trying to let them know there was a guy named Sanford once,

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
and you're like, oh, more like Renford, like, yeah, well, we,

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
what do you think the name is of the Dracula's thrall?

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Renfield?

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Oh, shit.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
But you know what, dumb name.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Renford.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
If I had a thrall.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Renford, the big red dog.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
Was, was, was Renfield a vampire or what?

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Why is the-

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
He wanted to become a vampire.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
And in exchange for that, he agreed to eat cockroaches?

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
Why is it baked into his character that he has to eat cockroaches?

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
We've got three movies I could name where he eat cockroaches.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
I think he's just like a mess. Like, he was just kind of like,

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
it's just a, like, Dracula, like, sucks some of his blood.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Yeah, so like, Brom Stoker clearly, like, said, like,

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
oh, when he ate a roach, and then every person that makes a movie is like,

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
well, give the people what they want.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
They want a fucking bat person.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
They don't need no fucking Renfield's eating brother.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Well, that's why they got Dracula.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
It's not Renfield the movie.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
It's not Brom Stoker's Renfield.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
Yeah, some Batman movies have robins, some don't.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Sometimes they have Batgirl, sometimes they don't.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Like, sometimes they have a Batcave, sometimes they don't.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
Every Dracula movie is like, oh, there's a Renfield,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
and he's like, mm, gotta eat that roach.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Otherwise, you wouldn't know who I was.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
And I'm like, why is he eating roaches?

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Does he wish that they were people?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
And he doesn't, he wasn't a vampire?

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Yeah.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
But then he's like...

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Like, it's a, it's, it's, I'm telling you, it's a mess.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
The movie's a mess. The story's a mess.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
They should change it. Then they'd be famous.

38:22.000 --> 38:27.000
I also feel like in a very, in a very nerdy sense,

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
roaches are probably really cheap.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Well, yeah.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
On set.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Oh, on set?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Yeah, so they were like, you get spiders, rats,

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
or you got these roaches for like eight for a dollar.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
And production was like, fucking, he's eating roaches.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
You think that Brom Stoker described him eating

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
in a really expensive spider.

38:47.000 --> 38:52.000
And he ate the most delicious, multi, huge,

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
like peacock spider, rare species from South America.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
And then, and then the first movie got made and they're like,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
well, isn't there really just a roach?

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Like the line producers going, I don't know.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
I mean, like these spiders are pretty expensive.

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
I mean, isn't a roach just a spider missing two legs or something?

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
And we can only afford this leg, man.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
I went to a community college.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
For me, most important building, the cafeteria.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Every scene should happen in there.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
Yeah.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
What's with, what's with all this,

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Abbot's apartment, Annie's apartment.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
People gotta eat.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
Put them in a cafeteria.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
It's half a sound stage.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
It's already painted.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
Hey, can we put it in the cafeteria?

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
I know it's a spaceship, but could it be a cafeteria ship?

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
I don't want anybody inferring from that that Pat Kenlon,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
the line producer of community,

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
was anything less than a wizard and a supportive ninja.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
It just did become a running joke that when we were writing something,

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
I'd be like, can it be in the cafeteria?

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Because he would ask that.

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
That was his job to ask that, but he wasn't stingy or unsupportive.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
Sorry, I'm sensitive to people's legacies.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I'm ready to die.

40:12.000 --> 40:18.000
I'd like to leave a fucking footprint without a turd in it.

40:18.000 --> 40:23.000
Or enough of a turd that the footprint would be shaped like a middle finger.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Who stepped here?

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
Fuck you stepped here.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
You sure did.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Where were they going?

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Your mother.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Why?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
To fuck you, her mother.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Yeah.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Why couldn't you say that?

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
I don't know. I'm getting confused.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Have you been drinking?

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Maybe.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Fuck you.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Oh shit.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Sorry everybody.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
No.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
This bit went over pretty well last time.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
MC gun control.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Thank you.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
I don't have to change the t-shirt now.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Here.

41:15.000 --> 41:20.000
I am a character that is a rapper.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
I have a high voice.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Do we have a beat?

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
That's a good beat.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
It's a very clear and distinct beat.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Okay.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
Opening titles for a David Fincher film.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Or a beat.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Yeah.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
That was a good call.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
I'm here with my white friends.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Making a movie.

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
That sounded like a David Fincher soundtrack.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
MC gun control.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Oh, this is nice.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I just wanted to explain my bit.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
And then we could be done.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I didn't need to rap.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
But that would be ridiculous.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
But if I did, now I'm curious.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
What if I did want to rap?

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
I just want to see.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Is somebody's phone on?

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
This is excellent.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Is that...

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Is that...

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Turn the beat up a bit.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Is that rock?

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
The path of least resistance.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Turn it off.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
You know what I'll do?

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Yeah.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
There you go.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Yeah.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Yeah.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Yeah.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Yeah.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Okay, sarcastic.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Yeah.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
East. West.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
East. West.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
West. West.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
West. West.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
West. Disney, politic.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
West.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
West. West

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
West.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
West West. West.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
West. West. West.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
West. West. West.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
West. West. West.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
West.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
West. West. West.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
West. West. West.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.900
Tell what I'm in favor of.

43:25.900 --> 43:30.900
I fucked your mama so hard, I had to savor her pussy.

43:33.240 --> 43:35.240
I had to savor her pussy.

43:37.680 --> 43:40.880
Yo, I savor her pussy too.

43:40.880 --> 43:42.720
Oh no, I'm a seed.

43:45.320 --> 43:46.420
Hold on.

43:46.420 --> 43:47.460
You can say it.

43:50.060 --> 43:50.900
Dad.

43:50.900 --> 43:55.900
That's right, I'm here to take you home, MC Gun Control.

43:59.200 --> 44:00.200
But.

44:00.200 --> 44:05.200
But nothing, the time of your ambiguity driven sketch character

44:08.480 --> 44:10.880
has come to a close.

44:10.880 --> 44:11.720
No.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.420
No.

44:14.420 --> 44:18.020
Clarity is the new name of the game.

44:18.020 --> 44:21.720
I fucked your mama and you know that I knew her name.

44:21.720 --> 44:25.460
I have the answers on MC Gun Control's dad.

44:25.460 --> 44:29.960
I'd never fuck you in between, and fuck you good or bad.

44:29.960 --> 44:32.800
There's always a clear answer.

44:32.800 --> 44:36.540
I fucked your mama and I am a tiny dancer.

44:38.040 --> 44:39.540
What the fuck are you doing?

44:40.740 --> 44:42.440
I'm taking your throne.

44:42.440 --> 44:44.440
Then I'm suing.

44:44.440 --> 44:46.180
Take me to court.

44:46.180 --> 44:48.180
I will.

44:52.980 --> 44:54.580
The next day in court.

44:57.620 --> 45:01.960
Hear ye, hear ye, I'm MC Judge.

45:03.700 --> 45:07.060
I'm a third character that goes back and forth

45:07.060 --> 45:10.240
between the knob and turning.

45:10.240 --> 45:15.240
All rise for me to have a judgment in the case

45:16.440 --> 45:19.680
of MC Gun Control versus his dad.

45:21.980 --> 45:25.580
Thank you, your honor.

45:25.580 --> 45:30.060
Yo, I'd like to make the case against this motherfucker.

45:30.060 --> 45:33.960
I'd like to talk about how he never raised me right.

45:36.760 --> 45:37.760
I object.

45:38.700 --> 45:39.760
Sustained.

45:39.760 --> 45:40.700
Oh, shit.

45:40.700 --> 45:42.360
Sorry, sorry.

45:42.360 --> 45:43.200
Sustained.

45:44.900 --> 45:47.580
Well, I already wanted to sustain it.

45:48.580 --> 45:51.040
Okay, well, you're still not supposed to say it.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.180
Fine.

45:52.180 --> 45:53.080
Sustained.

45:53.080 --> 45:53.980
Is that good?

45:53.980 --> 45:54.820
For who?

45:54.820 --> 45:55.780
Me. No.

45:58.380 --> 46:00.660
You mean I wanted to be, what's the other thing?

46:00.660 --> 46:01.680
Overruled.

46:01.680 --> 46:03.020
Is it overruled?

46:03.020 --> 46:04.120
Yeah.

46:04.120 --> 46:05.060
Good.

46:05.060 --> 46:06.300
I'm being sarcastic.

46:08.160 --> 46:09.320
I sustained it.

46:09.320 --> 46:11.460
Sustained and a judgment.

46:12.400 --> 46:13.800
Yeah.

46:13.800 --> 46:17.140
And that, you're telling me that's bad for me.

46:18.100 --> 46:20.140
Look, man, I'm just a judge.

46:21.340 --> 46:24.240
My story goes back beyond the ages.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.080
Hit it.

46:29.980 --> 46:30.920
Yo.

46:30.920 --> 46:32.480
Back beyond the ages.

46:32.480 --> 46:33.480
Judge rep.

46:33.480 --> 46:35.480
Yo, backstory judge rep.

46:35.480 --> 46:39.520
Ask not what you can do for your country.

46:39.520 --> 46:43.600
Ask what your country can do for you.

46:43.600 --> 46:44.900
This is the backstory.

46:44.900 --> 46:45.860
I got it backwards.

46:45.860 --> 46:46.700
To the judge.

46:46.700 --> 46:47.960
But you'll figure out what I meant.

46:47.960 --> 46:51.440
Yo, Mr. President, I'm not a judge yet.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.680
I'm still a lawyer, but I gotta warn you.

46:53.680 --> 46:57.140
I find you guilty of about to get shot.

46:57.140 --> 47:00.520
Ask not why I would be shot,

47:00.520 --> 47:02.180
but how I would be shot.

47:02.180 --> 47:03.780
No, he won't listen to me.

47:03.780 --> 47:05.820
Yo.

47:05.820 --> 47:06.660
Yo.

47:07.860 --> 47:10.380
Yo, nobody listen to me.

47:10.380 --> 47:12.460
I'm just a backstory judge.

47:12.460 --> 47:14.400
Listen to my story.

47:15.560 --> 47:19.300
I tried to warn JFK and he didn't listen to me

47:19.300 --> 47:21.800
and he got blown away.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.240
Now I got a gavel in my hand.

47:24.240 --> 47:27.680
I try to meet out justice all across the land.

47:27.680 --> 47:29.500
I try to hammer it here.

47:29.500 --> 47:31.440
Try to hammer it there.

47:31.440 --> 47:34.320
I heard a case the other day about a woman

47:34.320 --> 47:37.080
versus her own hair.

47:37.080 --> 47:40.120
Cut to that, cut to that case.

47:40.120 --> 47:42.620
Otherwise, that was a bad rhyme.

47:44.120 --> 47:45.460
All right, fuck you guys.

47:45.460 --> 47:47.860
You're like my rare, rare part.

47:47.860 --> 47:48.700
You know what?

47:48.700 --> 47:52.300
I'm at the, my hair strangled me

47:52.300 --> 47:56.860
and I'm suing it for damages to my throat.

47:56.860 --> 48:00.340
Ma'am, I'm a man.

48:00.340 --> 48:02.540
I know you've been thinking I was a lady.

48:02.540 --> 48:05.680
It's important to get this across.

48:05.680 --> 48:09.680
But, you know, you shouldn't represent yourself.

48:09.680 --> 48:11.180
No, I know.

48:11.180 --> 48:13.860
That's what my hair said.

48:13.860 --> 48:18.260
I hope that, I hope that I try a case of true importance.

48:18.260 --> 48:20.900
What would that be like?

48:20.900 --> 48:22.900
Excuse me, Your Honor.

48:25.100 --> 48:26.940
Yes?

48:26.940 --> 48:31.940
I have apparently a rap for you

48:31.940 --> 48:36.940
about how I would like to sue my father.

48:38.940 --> 48:40.940
Go on.

48:40.940 --> 48:42.940
Yeah.

48:42.940 --> 48:44.940
What?

48:44.940 --> 48:46.940
Yeah.

48:46.940 --> 48:48.940
Me?

48:48.940 --> 48:50.940
No.

48:50.940 --> 48:52.940
What?

48:52.940 --> 48:54.940
Yeah.

48:54.940 --> 48:56.940
Yeah.

48:56.940 --> 48:58.940
Yeah.

48:58.940 --> 49:00.940
Okay.

49:00.940 --> 49:02.940
Yeah.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.940
Yeah.

49:04.940 --> 49:06.940
Yeah.

49:06.940 --> 49:08.940
Okay.

49:08.940 --> 49:10.940
All right.

49:10.940 --> 49:12.940
Let me explain how the legal system works.

49:12.940 --> 49:14.940
Wait.

49:14.940 --> 49:16.940
If you want to sue somebody, you can just sue somebody.

49:16.940 --> 49:18.940
It's not up to the judge.

49:18.940 --> 49:20.940
I'm not like a barista.

49:20.940 --> 49:22.940
It's not like the genius bar.

49:22.940 --> 49:26.940
And request a lawsuit?

49:26.940 --> 49:28.940
No, it's not going to help.

49:28.940 --> 49:30.940
That would be a terrible structured system.

49:30.940 --> 49:32.940
You can't...

49:32.940 --> 49:34.940
That would mean that you had more recourse to justice

49:34.940 --> 49:36.940
than a normal person.

49:36.940 --> 49:38.940
That would be really fucked up.

49:38.940 --> 49:40.940
Say no more.

49:40.940 --> 49:42.940
Here's a gun.

49:44.940 --> 49:46.940
Uh-oh.

49:46.940 --> 49:48.940
What do you mean?

49:48.940 --> 49:50.940
Why are you giving me a gun?

49:50.940 --> 49:54.940
I may be for or against it.

49:54.940 --> 49:58.940
But I would be ashamed to let it out of control.

49:58.940 --> 50:00.940
Beat.

50:02.940 --> 50:04.940
Oh, God. I'm going to die.

50:04.940 --> 50:06.940
What do you mean, beat?

50:06.940 --> 50:08.940
What a terrible time for a beat.

50:08.940 --> 50:10.940
Don't point at him. You said beat.

50:10.940 --> 50:12.940
He's just...

50:12.940 --> 50:14.940
No beat.

50:14.940 --> 50:16.940
What a terrible...

50:16.940 --> 50:18.940
In a world where there's no wrong answers

50:18.940 --> 50:20.940
when it's time for a rap.

50:20.940 --> 50:22.940
A guy pulls out a gun.

50:22.940 --> 50:24.940
Let's just say, beat.

50:24.940 --> 50:26.940
Oh, I'm going to get shot.

50:26.940 --> 50:28.940
I don't know about it.

50:28.940 --> 50:30.940
Beat.

50:32.940 --> 50:34.940
Look, I'm just trying to fill time

50:34.940 --> 50:36.940
so that you guys can get home.

50:36.940 --> 50:38.940
Hell yeah. You're doing a great job.

50:38.940 --> 50:40.940
Our soup is almost done.

50:42.940 --> 50:44.940
Our cup soup is almost done.

50:44.940 --> 50:46.940
What have you guys been up to this week?

50:46.940 --> 50:48.940
Have you learned how to make that

50:48.940 --> 50:50.940
Mac of yours

50:50.940 --> 50:52.940
download the World Wide Web yet?

50:52.940 --> 50:54.940
Yep.

50:54.940 --> 50:56.940
I would do my vocal exercises

50:56.940 --> 50:58.940
if my voice is getting stronger every day.

50:58.940 --> 51:00.940
What kind of... Are you doing any diphthong

51:00.940 --> 51:02.940
and tripthong slurs?

51:02.940 --> 51:04.940
Oh, shit.

51:04.940 --> 51:06.940
You know I am.

51:06.940 --> 51:08.940
How do they differ?

51:08.940 --> 51:10.940
I couldn't tell you.

51:10.940 --> 51:12.940
Well, no, I mean in number.

51:12.940 --> 51:14.940
The tripthong is three.

51:14.940 --> 51:16.940
I got a little piano app

51:16.940 --> 51:18.940
where I have to see

51:18.940 --> 51:20.940
where my vocal ceiling is every day.

51:20.940 --> 51:22.940
So I start...

51:22.940 --> 51:24.940
I think I'm at

51:24.940 --> 51:26.940
B4.

51:26.940 --> 51:28.940
And I

51:28.940 --> 51:30.940
have to sing that note every day.

51:30.940 --> 51:32.940
That's my ceiling.

51:32.940 --> 51:34.940
And then you're done when you get to after.

51:34.940 --> 51:36.940
Yeah.

51:36.940 --> 51:38.940
It was Brandon's idea.

51:38.940 --> 51:40.940
I saw it in his eyes.

51:40.940 --> 51:42.940
Good job, DH.

51:42.940 --> 51:44.940
B.

51:44.940 --> 51:46.940
Look, I don't need to...

51:46.940 --> 51:48.940
All I do,

51:48.940 --> 51:50.940
I show up, I try to entertain you people.

51:50.940 --> 51:52.940
You're doing great.

51:52.940 --> 51:54.940
No, I don't need that.

51:54.940 --> 51:56.940
Dan, tell you a new favorite joke,

51:56.940 --> 51:58.940
the cancer joke.

51:58.940 --> 52:00.940
What's the difference between me and cancer?

52:00.940 --> 52:02.940
That's your new favorite joke.

52:02.940 --> 52:04.940
Cancer?

52:04.940 --> 52:06.940
Cancer.

52:06.940 --> 52:08.940
Remember this?

52:08.940 --> 52:10.940
What's the difference between me and cancer?

52:10.940 --> 52:12.940
I...

52:12.940 --> 52:14.940
No.

52:14.940 --> 52:16.940
Will go away for $50.

52:20.940 --> 52:22.940
B.

52:22.940 --> 52:24.940
We told this joke.

52:24.940 --> 52:26.940
I don't remember.

52:26.940 --> 52:28.940
What's the difference between me and cancer?

52:28.940 --> 52:30.940
What's the difference between me and cancer?

52:30.940 --> 52:32.940
If you get me,

52:32.940 --> 52:34.940
you

52:34.940 --> 52:36.940
have

52:36.940 --> 52:38.940
some support from your government.

52:38.940 --> 52:40.940
I told...

52:40.940 --> 52:42.940
I told you this joke a few days ago,

52:42.940 --> 52:44.940
it was your favorite joke.

52:44.940 --> 52:46.940
Okay, well...

52:46.940 --> 52:48.940
What's the difference between me and cancer?

52:48.940 --> 52:50.940
Dan's favorite joke.

52:50.940 --> 52:52.940
Clearly, you know that sometimes I drunk.

52:52.940 --> 52:54.940
What's the difference between me...

52:54.940 --> 52:56.940
What's the difference between you

52:56.940 --> 52:58.940
and cancer?

52:58.940 --> 53:00.940
My dad didn't beat cancer.

53:00.940 --> 53:02.940
Yeah!

53:02.940 --> 53:04.940
That is an incredible joke.

53:04.940 --> 53:06.940
It's a fucking great joke.

53:06.940 --> 53:08.940
That's fantastic.

53:08.940 --> 53:10.940
Was that on stage?

53:10.940 --> 53:12.940
No, we didn't...

53:12.940 --> 53:14.940
Me, you and Dina were hanging out.

53:14.940 --> 53:16.940
It's so dark.

53:16.940 --> 53:18.940
But it really is perfect.

53:18.940 --> 53:20.940
You guys, you're hanging out a lot.

53:22.940 --> 53:24.940
I'll see you guys once a month.

53:26.940 --> 53:28.940
From a joke's perspective...

53:28.940 --> 53:30.940
Yeah, it is.

53:30.940 --> 53:32.940
I like it.

53:32.940 --> 53:34.940
It's like a little piece of origami

53:34.940 --> 53:36.940
that's not precious,

53:36.940 --> 53:38.940
but also isn't, like, hack.

53:38.940 --> 53:40.940
I'm sitting at home.

53:42.940 --> 53:44.940
Staring at the ceiling.

53:44.940 --> 53:46.940
We're telling hilarious cancer jokes.

53:48.940 --> 53:50.940
The only thing I have is my dog.

53:52.940 --> 53:54.940
You're married.

53:56.940 --> 53:58.940
She's playing magic cards with you, though.

53:58.940 --> 54:00.940
Yeah, you should learn. It's fun.

54:00.940 --> 54:02.940
I hate games.

54:02.940 --> 54:04.940
You have a dog and you're married.

54:04.940 --> 54:06.940
I have a dog and I'm married.

54:06.940 --> 54:08.940
Well, who needs friends?

54:08.940 --> 54:10.940
What's the difference between your wife and the dog?

54:10.940 --> 54:12.940
Your dog's not going to leave you

54:12.940 --> 54:14.940
when he hears...

54:14.940 --> 54:16.940
That you have cancer.

54:18.940 --> 54:20.940
I'm all alone and I have...

54:22.940 --> 54:24.940
Oh, my God.

54:24.940 --> 54:26.940
We're just riffing up here.

54:26.940 --> 54:32.940
It's a riff.

54:32.940 --> 54:34.940
What if your dog left when he found out you had cancer?

54:34.940 --> 54:38.940
That'd be the fucking shittiest dog in the world.

54:38.940 --> 54:40.940
I told you this. I didn't tell you...

54:40.940 --> 54:42.940
Maybe I didn't tell you this.

54:42.940 --> 54:44.940
On Kate's birthday, the cherry pie story?

54:44.940 --> 54:46.940
No.

54:48.940 --> 54:50.940
It's just an evocative dessert.

54:50.940 --> 54:52.940
Somebody in the crowd knows about it.

54:52.940 --> 54:54.940
A very self-satisfying baker back there.

54:54.940 --> 54:56.940
So it's Kate's birthday.

54:56.940 --> 54:58.940
And we go...

54:58.940 --> 55:00.940
We get up in the morning.

55:00.940 --> 55:02.940
We go to the gym.

55:02.940 --> 55:04.940
And my trainer goes,

55:04.940 --> 55:06.940
Today, we're going to do push-ups

55:06.940 --> 55:08.940
until you can't anymore.

55:08.940 --> 55:10.940
And I go,

55:10.940 --> 55:12.940
Fuck!

55:12.940 --> 55:14.940
And then I do it and I feel like shit.

55:14.940 --> 55:16.940
And I pay him and I leave

55:16.940 --> 55:18.940
and I walk outside. It's hot.

55:18.940 --> 55:20.940
It's awful.

55:20.940 --> 55:22.940
And Kate goes, we need to go to Whole Foods

55:22.940 --> 55:24.940
for some cherry pies for my birthday tonight.

55:24.940 --> 55:26.940
And I'm like, I'm on it.

55:26.940 --> 55:28.940
I'm on that. I'm totally on it.

55:28.940 --> 55:30.940
Feeling a little queasy.

55:30.940 --> 55:32.940
Can we go home immediately after that?

55:32.940 --> 55:34.940
I think I need to lie down after

55:34.940 --> 55:36.940
getting hurt.

55:36.940 --> 55:38.940
And she goes, no problem.

55:38.940 --> 55:40.940
So we get there, we get the groceries,

55:40.940 --> 55:42.940
put it on there.

55:42.940 --> 55:44.940
I'm like, stomach's not feeling all that great.

55:44.940 --> 55:46.940
You're in the car and the traffic's

55:46.940 --> 55:48.940
a little herky-jerky. Stop starting.

55:48.940 --> 55:50.940
And I go, try not to break so hard

55:50.940 --> 55:52.940
because I feel like I might

55:58.940 --> 56:00.940
And I puke all over the birthday pies.

56:02.940 --> 56:04.940
And I look up at Kate

56:04.940 --> 56:06.940
who's going

56:10.940 --> 56:12.940
Happy birthday to me.

56:12.940 --> 56:14.940
You puked all over the birthday pies.

56:14.940 --> 56:16.940
All over the birthday pies. We got new pies.

56:16.940 --> 56:18.940
We got new pies.

56:18.940 --> 56:20.940
We got new pies, but I puked

56:20.940 --> 56:22.940
twice on it.

56:22.940 --> 56:24.940
I'm like, I'm so sorry.

56:24.940 --> 56:26.940
She's like, it's fine.

56:26.940 --> 56:28.940
It was not fine.

56:28.940 --> 56:30.940
It was awful.

56:30.940 --> 56:32.940
I puked all over that.

56:32.940 --> 56:34.940
And I don't know,

56:34.940 --> 56:36.940
something happened when I puked

56:36.940 --> 56:38.940
that I hurt my shoulder.

56:38.940 --> 56:40.940
I mean, your body is doing a thing

56:40.940 --> 56:42.940
that you never thought it would do.

56:42.940 --> 56:44.940
So for the next couple of days,

56:44.940 --> 56:46.940
I have a major pain

56:46.940 --> 56:48.940
and I have to remember that it's because you puked.

56:48.940 --> 56:50.940
Yeah, because I puked all over her birthday.

56:50.940 --> 56:52.940
And so

56:52.940 --> 56:54.940
I go, oh,

56:54.940 --> 56:56.940
when I went back to get the cherry pies,

56:56.940 --> 56:58.940
I bought some

56:58.940 --> 57:00.940
bengay to rub on my shoulder.

57:00.940 --> 57:02.940
And I left it out in the car.

57:02.940 --> 57:04.940
I'm going to go outside.

57:04.940 --> 57:06.940
Lately, it's been a furnace outside.

57:06.940 --> 57:08.940
It was like 122 degrees

57:08.940 --> 57:10.940
in the valley back then.

57:10.940 --> 57:12.940
My car was outside.

57:12.940 --> 57:14.940
Open up the door, grab the bengay.

57:14.940 --> 57:16.940
Oh, it's a hot tube.

57:16.940 --> 57:18.940
I'd better go back inside

57:18.940 --> 57:20.940
because it's so hot. Oh my gosh, it's really hot.

57:20.940 --> 57:22.940
Woo, woo. Thank God for AC.

57:22.940 --> 57:24.940
This is going to feel good.

57:24.940 --> 57:26.940
Haven't used bengay in a while.

57:26.940 --> 57:28.940
How long?

57:28.940 --> 57:30.940
A couple of decades.

57:30.940 --> 57:32.940
I'm so proud of your generation

57:32.940 --> 57:34.940
that you weren't like,

57:34.940 --> 57:36.940
ah, bengay, how long?

57:36.940 --> 57:38.940
That was like,

57:38.940 --> 57:40.940
every time I see a tube of bengay,

57:40.940 --> 57:42.940
I am forced to do this.

57:42.940 --> 57:44.940
I've lived in Los Angeles for 20 years.

57:44.940 --> 57:46.940
I have nothing but shame about this,

57:46.940 --> 57:48.940
but I see the words and I go,

57:48.940 --> 57:50.940
bengay, how long?

57:50.940 --> 57:52.940
And I am so proud of you tonight.

57:52.940 --> 57:54.940
Like, there are some things

57:54.940 --> 57:56.940
that just get solved over time.

57:56.940 --> 57:58.940
Why is it called bengay?

57:58.940 --> 58:00.940
Why? Why is it called bengay?

58:00.940 --> 58:02.940
Is there something in the words

58:02.940 --> 58:04.940
that say, cream that you put on

58:04.940 --> 58:06.940
when it hurts?

58:06.940 --> 58:08.940
Ben Hur said to his

58:08.940 --> 58:10.940
brother bengay,

58:10.940 --> 58:12.940
let's

58:12.940 --> 58:14.940
switch.

58:14.940 --> 58:16.940
What's the joke?

58:16.940 --> 58:18.940
What's the joke?

58:18.940 --> 58:20.940
It's red buttons. What the fuck is the joke?

58:20.940 --> 58:22.940
Never had a dinner.

58:22.940 --> 58:24.940
I didn't know this joke.

58:24.940 --> 58:26.940
Ben Hur who said to his sister

58:26.940 --> 58:28.940
bengay, let's switch.

58:28.940 --> 58:30.940
Never had a dinner.

58:30.940 --> 58:32.940
Never had a dinner.

58:32.940 --> 58:34.940
Alright.

58:34.940 --> 58:36.940
Ben Hur said to his sister

58:36.940 --> 58:38.940
bengay, let's switch.

58:38.940 --> 58:40.940
If we'd be bengay,

58:40.940 --> 58:42.940
never had a dinner.

58:42.940 --> 58:44.940
It's not funny.

58:44.940 --> 58:46.940
We would literally

58:46.940 --> 58:48.940
go up to each other on the playground,

58:48.940 --> 58:50.940
we would walk up to each other

58:50.940 --> 58:52.940
and we would say, say bengay.

58:52.940 --> 58:54.940
That's all we would do.

58:54.940 --> 58:56.940
We would say, say bengay.

58:56.940 --> 58:58.940
And they would say, bengay.

58:58.940 --> 59:00.940
And then we'd say, how long?

59:00.940 --> 59:02.940
That's it.

59:02.940 --> 59:04.940
That's how hard it was to be gay

59:04.940 --> 59:06.940
when I was a kid.

59:06.940 --> 59:08.940
How easy it was to be funny.

59:08.940 --> 59:10.940
Well,

59:10.940 --> 59:12.940
I want to know what happened with the hot bengay.

59:12.940 --> 59:14.940
Okay, so run inside.

59:14.940 --> 59:16.940
Oh, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot.

59:16.940 --> 59:18.940
Kate's off doing something, running errands.

59:18.940 --> 59:20.940
And the bengay's been in the car.

59:20.940 --> 59:22.940
How long?

59:22.940 --> 59:24.940
Couple days, couple days.

59:24.940 --> 59:26.940
Anyway, I go in there

59:26.940 --> 59:28.940
and I open up the thing

59:28.940 --> 59:30.940
and I squeeze it

59:30.940 --> 59:32.940
and because of the heat buildup

59:32.940 --> 59:34.940
it goes, boom!

59:34.940 --> 59:36.940
It splatters all over my head.

59:36.940 --> 59:38.940
It's like, oh, it's like Peter North

59:38.940 --> 59:40.940
all over the place.

59:42.940 --> 59:44.940
And I'm like, oh, shit,

59:44.940 --> 59:46.940
waste not, what not, better rub it in.

59:46.940 --> 59:48.940
Waste not, what not.

59:48.940 --> 59:50.940
This will probably make

59:50.940 --> 59:52.940
my shoulder feel better, quicker.

59:52.940 --> 59:54.940
And I'm rubbing it in and I'm rubbing it in and

59:54.940 --> 59:56.940
and I forgot.

59:56.940 --> 59:58.940
Did you rub it on your face?

59:58.940 --> 01:00:00.940
Look, yes.

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.940
I forgot that

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:04.940
bengay heats up

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:06.940
after a while.

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:08.940
Isn't that a bit in

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.940
Revenge of the Nerds or something?

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:12.940
Well, but

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:14.940
I wanted to pause

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.940
the commentary here because I wanted to say

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:18.940
I thought

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:20.940
it was going to be hot because it was in the car.

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:22.940
It was.

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:24.940
But it was hot and it was

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:26.940
pow!

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:28.940
It built up, it was just a little

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:30.940
and it just exploded.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.940
And you're like, oh, hotter than

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.940
regular, hotter than

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:36.940
first contact with bengay.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.940
Mostly it was like volume.

01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:40.940
It was like, wow, that's a lot.

01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:42.940
It's like a lot of bengay.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.940
And I just rub it in.

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:46.940
And I forget that after a while

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:48.940
it heats up.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:50.940
And somewhere between pop

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:52.940
and it heating up,

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.940
which I'm thinking is like about

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:56.940
two minutes,

01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:58.940
it's called the refractory period.

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:00.940
It's called

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:02.940
the refractory period.

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:04.940
Tell me if you repeat it.

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:06.940
I was ashamed of it the first time.

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:08.940
During the refractory period

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.940
I

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:12.940
must have touched

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:14.940
my shoulder,

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:16.940
my face,

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:18.940
my neck, my balls,

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:20.940
my dick, my asshole, my knees

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.940
or whatever.

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.940
There's just a roadmap

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.940
of what I get to myself

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:28.940
and get rid of all of this bengay.

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:30.940
And I start going

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.940
ooh,

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.940
ah, that's a little uncomfortable.

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:36.940
I hope that doesn't get any worse.

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:38.940
Oh, oh, okay.

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:40.940
Okay, getting real.

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.940
That's gotta be it. No, no, coming more.

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.940
Holy shit. Oh my god.

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.940
Rolling on the floor.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.940
Scream crying.

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:50.940
I'm in living room floor going,

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:52.940
ah, oh my god.

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.940
Help me, help me.

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.940
And I look up

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.940
and I see my dog on the couch

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.940
looking down at me, giving me

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:02.940
the same look that Kate gave me

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.940
when I threw up on her cherry pie.

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:06.940
Just,

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:08.940
you've

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.940
really, this is, this is what I,

01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:12.940
this is what I signed up for.

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.940
And I go, ah,

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:16.940
you don't understand.

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:18.940
Lolly, it hurts so much.

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:20.940
Daddy made a bad mistake.

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.940
Oh, I mean,

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:24.940
he forgot it burned.

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.940
The dog is like, you have the power

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.940
to open and close the door.

01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:30.940
Yeah.

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:32.940
Like,

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:36.940
you, you, the,

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:38.940
he who opens cans,

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:40.940
this is what, this is what you're vulnerable to.

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.940
I know. A tube of,

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:44.940
of something smaller than a cat.

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.940
How did you get from

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.940
an explosion of bengue down to your balls?

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:50.940
Why did that become a thing?

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:52.940
I, I don't know. I just, I guess,

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:54.940
well, it had been three minutes.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.940
And he was alone.

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.940
What do you think he was going to touch?

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:02.940
An atlas? Yeah.

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:04.940
Very true.

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:06.940
The world's been

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:08.940
explored. Yeah.

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:10.940
I, I, I made pickled

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:12.940
eggs one time when I cut up some habanero peppers

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:14.940
and I was making some of the best

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:16.940
pickled eggs of all time. I hope this has nothing to do

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:18.940
with anything.

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:20.940
And then an hour or two later

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:22.940
I masturbated,

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:24.940
but I had forgotten

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.940
to not wash my hands a million

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.940
times. And my

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:30.940
dick was on fire for a week.

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.940
I've masturbated.

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:34.940
It's not a fucking alert.

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:36.940
Like, you, like, you cannot

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.940
cut a habanero pepper and then touch

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.940
anything forever for the rest of your life.

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:42.940
When I was like

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:44.940
15.

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.940
And I'm, so I'm talking fucking

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:48.940
back to PPS jerk it

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:50.940
stories.

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:52.940
It's your tax dollars at work.

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.940
Like I've talked on this show about how when I,

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:56.940
I was like 11, when I hit 11

01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:58.940
it was no turning back. It was

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:00.940
Inspector Gadget. You were going to keep on aging.

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.940
Yeah.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.940
So when, but when I'm

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:06.940
at, I'm, I'm 15 years old

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:08.940
and it's just, there's

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:10.940
no, there's no stopping. It's just, it's

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.940
just a round the clock fucking union

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:14.940
job, like jerk it off.

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:16.940
And, like, I

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.940
literally, I would literally like go in the

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:20.940
my, my own house's basement

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.940
like, you know, 15.

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.940
So I live with my parents like doing so much

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:26.940
that I'm like, just pretending

01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:28.940
I have a reason to be in the basement

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.940
which is so mythical.

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:32.940
Like, like, like, I was

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.940
that, that, that meant that I had jerked

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.940
off so much that everyone knew that's

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:38.940
all I did in my room.

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:40.940
And that I was like, I'm going to change a fuse.

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:42.940
What it was I, like, I had so much jerking off to do.

01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:44.940
And I

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:46.940
just remember like, I

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:48.940
you know, it chafing

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:50.940
and then, like

01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:52.940
trying to employ a product

01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:54.940
because I had seen in the movies or heard in

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:56.940
popular culture that, you know, like the

01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.940
lotions and the things and I remember trying

01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:00.940
to use some product.

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.940
I don't remember what it was. It wasn't

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.940
it wasn't anything comedically harmful

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:06.940
like, like, like

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.940
Ben Gay or mentholiptus like, like, oh it burns

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:10.940
or anything like that. But it also was

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.940
not idealized for

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:14.940
what? What'd you say?

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:16.940
How long?

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:18.940
I thought, I thought you were, I thought

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:20.940
but, but, but all I remember

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:22.940
all I remember

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:24.940
is, uh, is the

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:26.940
result which is that, like, I just after going

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.940
to town forever

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:30.940
uh, uh

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.940
sometime around, who knows why I stopped

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:34.940
long enough to notice anything.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:36.940
Maybe there was a solstice. I don't know.

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:38.940
But I remember

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.940
like, looking at my

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:42.940
little penis and being like

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.940
oh, like, I

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.940
I was, I had to

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:48.940
go to my parents. I didn't have to.

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:50.940
I did. This is how alarmed I was.

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:52.940
And I

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:54.940
I was like, I didn't show them but I was

01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:56.940
like, I think I

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.940
fucked up.

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:00.940
What were they, what were

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:02.940
they doing? What were they doing?

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:04.940
Was your dad, like, building stained glass?

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:06.940
Watching blazing saddles and my mom

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:08.940
was knitting? I don't know.

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:10.940
And I'm like, I, guys,

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:12.940
I need to ask a question

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:14.940
about

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:16.940
what it's possible to do

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:18.940
to your penis

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:20.940
if you do nothing but

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.940
I, and, and, and guys, remember

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:24.940
I, because I was like, I am alarmed

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.940
it, it looks

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:28.940
when I say

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:30.940
shriveled

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:32.940
I want you to understand

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.940
that I'm, it is a pre-shriveled

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.940
penis. Like, I just, it is,

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.940
it was, it was sort of like, there was

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:40.940
a, it, it, I remember

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:42.940
being scared that it had

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:44.940
this like, it was like,

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:46.940
it was like, like, shaped

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.940
like, like, like, there was something wrong.

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:50.940
I was, I was like, God, I broke my dick.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.940
I can't remember what it was. It was

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.940
like, to me at the time I was like, oh God

01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:56.940
I made my dick, like, what would we

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.940
would later, if, if, if

01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:00.940
Game of Thrones was on at the time I would

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:02.940
have been like, oh God, I turned my dick into

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.940
a stone disease. Like,

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:06.940
like, it was like, it was

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.940
like, it had like, it had like, scales.

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.940
Yeah. And I was like, what

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.940
have I done? Is that just a thing that

01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.940
happens when you use the wrong

01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.940
product on your dick? Why, of course

01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:18.940
it does. What was I thinking? Why would it

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:20.940
just put anything on my dick? And the answer

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:22.940
is, you know,

01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:24.940
shoot first, ask questions later. I, is the,

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.940
I, you don't, you're not,

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:28.940
you're not, you're not thinking, you know,

01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:30.940
you're not, you're not, you're not, it's not

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:32.940
a heist. You don't like, roll out a blueprint

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:34.940
and be like, here's how we're going to do it

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:36.940
for the maximum results. You're just, I mean,

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:38.940
if you're, by the time you're going through

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.940
a closet, you're like, a fucking

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:42.940
desperate man. Shoot first.

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:44.940
What, what, what was the, uh,

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:46.940
cure? No.

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:48.940
No, let's go slow. Okay.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.940
How, how did

01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.940
you establish contact? I,

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:54.940
I, I, all I remember is, because

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:56.940
I, I think I blocked a lot

01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:58.940
of it out because it's just so humiliating

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:00.940
to think about, but like, I,

01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:02.940
I remember, I know the fact that I did

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:04.940
because I was so concerned

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:06.940
that I, because I was like, well, this might be

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.940
a thing that, you know, you don't want

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:10.940
the story 20 years from now to be

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:12.940
and then I didn't say anything

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:14.940
and then my dick dissolved.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:16.940
Right. So I was, I was,

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:18.940
I was in my head, the only thing more

01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:20.940
powerful than my horniness

01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:22.940
and later I would find out, you can't

01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:24.940
do anything to a dick to kill it.

01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:26.940
We wish.

01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:28.940
I just wish I had known that. I thought it was

01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:30.940
a unicorn. I'm like, hey friend, what can I do

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:32.940
to keep you alive?

01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:34.940
You can't fucking,

01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:36.940
you can put one of these things in a

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:38.940
pair of pliers and like, it doesn't

01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:40.940
can't, what, what, what, yeah.

01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:42.940
Like, like that's the thing that nature's going to make frail.

01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:44.940
Um,

01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:46.940
all right. I hit a, I hit a,

01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:48.940
I hit a, I hit a nerve.

01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:50.940
Um, the, the, but I was like,

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:52.940
I was like, I was like, I'm worried about it.

01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:54.940
And it's like, I broached the subject with my,

01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:56.940
my mom, I think my dad too.

01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:58.940
Uh, and it was like,

01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:00.940
I think I broke my

01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:02.940
dick. How do you

01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:04.940
know? Is there such a thing as like,

01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:06.940
here's what I used. I can't remember what it was.

01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:08.940
And, and they were just like,

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:10.940
like, like, like so bummed

01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:12.940
out. They weren't

01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:14.940
really, I don't, I want to say they weren't

01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:16.940
of any help. Um,

01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:18.940
because they were probably like, they were

01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:20.940
probably like, well, do you want to go to a hospital or not?

01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.940
Don't tell us about that shit. You know, like, like,

01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:24.940
does it, does it hurt? No.

01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:26.940
It looks weird.

01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.940
Weirder than a dick.

01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:30.940
Yeah.

01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:32.940
I mean, like, I don't, like, does it,

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:34.940
that's why I'm asking. Mine's 15 years old.

01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:36.940
Does it ever, is it,

01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:38.940
if it looks like the following,

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:40.940
is that I, because I used this,

01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:42.940
I, I, I, I,

01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:44.940
after a while, I think the message I'm getting is I

01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:46.940
will wait for it to heal. Fuck you people.

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:48.940
What, what's the product?

01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:50.940
What, what, what did you use? I can't remember.

01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:52.940
I was probably like some kind of, like, really

01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:54.940
specific lotion that I was just like, well,

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.940
all lotions are the same, but it was like,

01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.940
maybe it was, like, a lotion for

01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.940
monkeys or something.

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.940
Like, I don't, I just remember.

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.940
Turtle wax.

01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:06.940
Yeah.

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.940
It really sticks out of my head

01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.940
that I was in the basement using

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.940
it, that I was like, I had gotten to the point

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:14.940
where I was like, I, because they see

01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:16.940
like intervention episodes where like the, the

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:18.940
grown man will just like, they won't even

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:20.940
explain it, but it'll just like, he'll just

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:22.940
have like a little corner in the basement

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.940
where he lights up his crack pipe, you know,

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:26.940
like, it's just like, it's become,

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:28.940
you know, like, and I feel as if it's just

01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.940
like, god damn. You know, this guy likes

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:32.940
jerking off.

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:34.940
You're lucky that you didn't have

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.940
a black mom

01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:38.940
who really coveted her hair

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:40.940
care products.

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.940
Because that

01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:44.940
was a choice that I had to make.

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.940
What a great dress.

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.940
Did that go south?

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.940
That went south because, you know, they become

01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:52.940
sleuths about the shit. You try to be like,

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:54.940
I was, I was in the shower and I was taking a

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:56.940
shower and I got some shampoo

01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:58.940
in my dick and

01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.940
she's not going to buy that shit.

01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:02.940
Wait, are you saying you got it in it?

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.940
Oh, so it burnt?

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:06.940
It's exactly what she said holding a Virginia Slims.

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:08.940
She's like, you got it in your dick?

01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:10.940
So you got it, you got it in your dick somehow.

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:12.940
Okay, Brandon.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:14.940
So now you have to make a choice.

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:16.940
Do you want to fuck with Matlock?

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.940
A little

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.940
super sleuth bitch? Or do you want to get some help?

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:22.940
Do you want your dick to fall off?

01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:24.940
Or do you want to become a bitch

01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:26.940
in front of your mom? Who is ready

01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:28.940
for that shit?

01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:30.940
She knows it's

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.940
indestructible. It's not her first dick.

01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:34.940
She's like, I

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.940
give two shits where my teenage

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:38.940
son's dick stings for a second.

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:40.940
You used my shampoo.

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:42.940
I'm going to shame you out of using my good shit.

01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:44.940
Now, how did it get

01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:46.940
in the tip of your dick?

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:48.940
I'll answer that. You stole it.

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:50.940
Right.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.940
Let's keep your dick out of my shampoo.

01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:54.940
I'm going to help you

01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:56.940
and wait for it to project.

01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:58.940
Is that a thing where you experiment with awful shit

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:00.940
that burns your pussy up?

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:04.940
Pineapple?

01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:06.940
Mariatica.

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.940
No, I don't think women

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:10.940
need lubrication the same way.

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.940
I mean, you always need lubrication.

01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:14.940
Don't get me wrong.

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:16.940
Don't get me wrong.

01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.940
I don't think guys generate

01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:20.940
their own.

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:22.940
I also don't think...

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:24.940
Look,

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:26.940
now we're getting into current events.

01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:28.940
Yeah.

01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:30.940
I don't use

01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:32.940
any soap.

01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:34.940
Bullshit.

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.940
Don't do that.

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:38.940
I only use Brandon's mom's

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:40.940
hair products now.

01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:46.940
Because, fucking, it's top of the line, man.

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:48.940
It's top of the line.

01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:50.940
It's collagen enriched.

01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:54.940
Should we get Levy up here

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:56.940
and find out what he uses?

01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.940
Yeah!

01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:00.940
See, Levy is a Levy man.

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.940
There's a Levy in the house.

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:04.940
Don't worry.

01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:06.940
There's another segue going to happen.

01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:12.940
What's happening, guys?

01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:14.940
What questions have you asked

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:16.940
your parents about your dick?

01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:18.940
What do you put on your dick?

01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:20.940
What questions?

01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:22.940
What do you put on your dick?

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.940
What do you put on your dick?

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:26.940
Oh, boy.

01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:28.940
That's a loaded question.

01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:30.940
Is that the question you want me to answer?

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.940
What weird product did you

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:34.940
use as a child for a moment

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:36.940
made you think you might have lost your dick?

01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:38.940
I got a good one.

01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:40.940
Silly putty?

01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:42.940
Hell yeah.

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:44.940
How do you know when you're finished?

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.940
I'm the only one that volunteered

01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:48.940
information and got totally made fun of for it.

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:50.940
Thank you, Levy.

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.940
For real? Silly putty?

01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:54.940
I had to be three or four years old

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:56.940
because I thought you were going to say

01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:58.940
I had to be at a board meeting

01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:00.940
at three...

01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.940
Four Silly Putty.

01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:04.940
We were meeting at Warner Brothers

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.940
three months ago. I had no time to fuck around.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.940
Did you think, because you saw the commercial

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.940
and you see how the Silly Putty

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:12.940
you put it on like a comic book

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:14.940
and you smear it on and you could peel it up

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:16.940
and you could see the Batman on it?

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:18.940
Yeah, I got bored of that, I guess.

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:20.940
So you think you're going to put it on your dick

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:22.940
and then you could see your dick in the putty?

01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.940
They could make his dick really big.

01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:26.940
He sculpted a vagina.

01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.940
Like a real psychopath.

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:30.940
I was just experimenting as a kid, I guess.

01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:32.940
I took it out of its little red shell

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.940
and it got so horny.

01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:36.940
My mom was working or whatever

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.940
and then I just mushed it on my dick.

01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:40.940
My mom was working or whatever.

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:42.940
I don't know. I just remember

01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:44.940
like, you know, because...

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.940
Way to shamer.

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.940
It is funny, you have to admit

01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:50.940
that there's still an adult impulse to like...

01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:52.940
I don't know.

01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:54.940
There was no supervision.

01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:56.940
Exactly.

01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:58.940
She was in the other room working

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:00.940
and I just mashed

01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.940
some silly putty on my dick

01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:04.940
but I made sure I was totally covered.

01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:06.940
I was in a shell.

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:08.940
You did this motion.

01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:10.940
Yeah, that's the motion I was doing.

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.940
Yeah.

01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:14.940
You made like a string.

01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:16.940
You were being sarcastic.

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:18.940
Yeah.

01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:22.940
It seemed pretty...

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:24.940
So then I just left it on.

01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:26.940
And then I went about my day.

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.940
If it ain't broke.

01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:30.940
I just like didn't think about it

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.940
and I was like, alright.

01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:34.940
And then I moved on to the next activity.

01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:36.940
What was your day?

01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:38.940
Oh, right?

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:40.940
He left it on because he's like, well this actually

01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:42.940
alleviates the pain from a slinky.

01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:44.940
Yeah.

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:46.940
So you got a dick covered in silly putty

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:48.940
and you said, okay, I got meetings.

01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:50.940
I got shit to do.

01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:52.940
I got Super Nintendo's. I got action figures.

01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:54.940
I got Nickelodeon.

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.940
It was a full schedule.

01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:58.940
I can't be wasting my time taking silly putty off of my dick.

01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:00.940
Yeah.

01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:02.940
Yeah.

01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:04.940
You know, like the gun at the beginning

01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:06.940
of a movie that you're going to reveal

01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:08.940
the end...

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:10.940
Did you go about your day

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:12.940
and then you all of a sudden made a bet

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:14.940
with somebody? I bet my dick's where it was yours.

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:16.940
It was there for a while.

01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:18.940
My mom took me out for errands.

01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:20.940
I was in my car seat, driving around.

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:22.940
And then we get back and it's like bath time.

01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:28.940
And so...

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:30.940
So we can call this Act 2.

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:32.940
Yeah.

01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:34.940
Maybe Act 3? Where are we at right now?

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:36.940
Meeting with the goddess.

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:38.940
No, the meeting with the goddess is...

01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:40.940
Yeah, I don't know.

01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:42.940
Having a good time during the day with silly putty.

01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:44.940
Like the best time.

01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:46.940
The silly putty on my dick.

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.940
The atonement is we come back from

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:50.940
a fun time junction

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.940
and

01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:54.940
it's bath time.

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:56.940
And your mom's like,

01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:58.940
we had the best day today.

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.940
Mom, I want you to understand.

01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:02.940
Yeah.

01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.940
Can I tell you a secret?

01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:06.940
Yeah, go ahead.

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:08.940
So obviously, you get undressed.

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:10.940
She's like, Jesus Christ, what the...

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:12.940
What?

01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:14.940
Why does your dick have Archie on it?

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:16.940
Do it.

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:18.940
Yeah.

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:20.940
And

01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:22.940
by that time, it had totally dried.

01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:24.940
So you couldn't get it off.

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.940
That's your deal breaker, everybody?

01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:30.940
You couldn't get it off that easy.

01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:32.940
So I just remember

01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:34.940
I soaked in the tub for a while

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:36.940
and then...

01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:38.940
Now your mom's

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.940
on board and she's like,

01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:42.940
well, we were gonna take a bath.

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:44.940
Why did you tell her?

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:46.940
I was like, I don't know how that happened.

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:48.940
Honestly, I have no recollection.

01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:50.940
You were working.

01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:52.940
You heard him. He threw her under the bus.

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:54.940
I was so young.

01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:56.940
Fucking shout out to moms.

01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:58.940
Goddamn.

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.940
We would not have our dicks without them.

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:02.940
Huh?

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.940
The modern version of that

01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:06.940
is every mom I've talked to

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.940
that's found their kid on the laptop.

01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:10.940
Same age, but they're just typing in

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.940
the craziest...

01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:14.940
Oh, that's how you think

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.940
vagina is spelled.

01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:18.940
Four years old just trying

01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:20.940
to figure shit out and getting rewarded

01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:22.940
by this fucking

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.940
speaking spell.

01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:26.940
So you put a silly party on your dick

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.940
and you left it on there and it congealed

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:30.940
and hardened.

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.940
And then your mom had to go to work

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:34.940
and fucking get it off your dick.

01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:36.940
It was like a...

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:38.940
It was like a...

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:40.940
It was...

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:42.940
A silly party can dry

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:44.940
and then it turns into clay?

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:46.940
That's as much as I remember, yeah.

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:48.940
It was like a cast.

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.940
No one signed it.

01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:54.940
I remember being pretty upset

01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:56.940
and confused.

01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:58.940
She probably let it slip a little bit

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:00.940
that she was a little put off.

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:02.940
You didn't want your mom to be upset.

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:04.940
Yeah, I was in trouble.

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.940
I don't think I grasped why.

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.940
She wasn't like, yay for experimenting.

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:10.940
She was like, overall, what the fuck?

01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:12.940
And then you're like, that's not a good thing

01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:14.940
for our mom to feel, so then you felt bad.

01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:16.940
Throughout the day, do you remember

01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.940
if at any time during the day...

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:20.940
I was so young, but...

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:22.940
I was just curious if you remember

01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:24.940
that at any time during the day, you were like...

01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:26.940
This is gonna...

01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:28.940
Did you just forget it entirely?

01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:30.940
No, I mean, you could...

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:32.940
Being in the car,

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:34.940
in my car seat,

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:36.940
clocking like...

01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:38.940
This is uncomfortable.

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:40.940
Because I have vague memories of shitting my pants,

01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:42.940
and then you just, like, hang out

01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:44.940
and wait to get busted.

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:46.940
I feel like you just wait,

01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:48.940
and then people start smelling, and you're like,

01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:50.940
God damn it.

01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:52.940
But you still feel like maybe there's some version...

01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:54.940
I'd like to know what my four-year-old self thought.

01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:56.940
Man, I don't know.

01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:58.940
Maybe like, giraffes will start attacking.

01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:00.940
I guess I was a strange kid.

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:02.940
I also remember this time where my dad had cut down

01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:04.940
this tree in my backyard.

01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:06.940
This is like... I was so young.

01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:08.940
And I just felt like,

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:10.940
man, that looks like a really great place to take a shit.

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:12.940
Just on this cleanly cut,

01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:14.940
like, stump of a tree.

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:16.940
And my parents were inside,

01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:18.940
and I was outside,

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:20.940
and I just fucking dropped trow

01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:22.940
and took a shit on the stump of the tree.

01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:24.940
I was like, all right, well, that was interesting.

01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:26.940
And then I was like,

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:28.940
well, I gotta go to the bathroom now,

01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:30.940
because I gotta wipe.

01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:32.940
And so I went inside, I wiped,

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:34.940
and like an hour later, my dad,

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:36.940
like...

01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:38.940
He went outside

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:40.940
to do some gardening or something.

01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:42.940
He was like, did you?

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:44.940
He was hoping the answer was no.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.940
He was like, I want

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:48.940
the answer to be no,

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:50.940
because I'm gonna call Bob Saget.

01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:52.940
Well, no, I mean, he...

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:54.940
I was like, no, no.

01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:56.940
Obviously, I was like, no, I didn't do that.

01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:58.940
And he was like, no, you fucking...

01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:00.940
Come on, that's human shit on a fucking tree stump!

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:02.940
He let it slide,

01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:04.940
but he was just like, I'm not...

01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:06.940
Son, you did it, or we have to move.

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:10.940
Like, think about your choices here.

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.940
He didn't...

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:14.940
He didn't shame me for doing it.

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:16.940
It's such a shame.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:18.940
I never got to fucking talk to him about this stuff.

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.940
It's you or it's Jean.

01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:22.940
I don't think...

01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:24.940
I kept that inside my whole life.

01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:26.940
I never talked to anybody about it.

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:28.940
I don't know if my mom remembers that,

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:30.940
but if I knew one of the things,

01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:32.940
I would be like, do you remember one of that?

01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:34.940
That was... I was like, it was me.

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:36.940
I love that it was a clean...

01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.940
Because I'm picturing a really...

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:40.940
Sawdust and pure...

01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:42.940
In my mind,

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:44.940
I see it as perfectly sanded

01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:46.940
and lacquered or whatever.

01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:48.940
With a little bit of dust though, right?

01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:50.940
Because there's a little bit of cat or dog in you

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.940
that was like, plus it's a little bit of...

01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:54.940
We're cousins of other mammals,

01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:56.940
so there's a common link there.

01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:58.940
I bet a cat would feel the same thing.

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.940
There was some kind of excited exhibitionism

01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:02.940
going through my mind, you know?

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:04.940
I also love Levy that if you could

01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:06.940
have another conversation with your departed father,

01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:08.940
it would be that way.

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:10.940
You wouldn't look at you and be like,

01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:12.940
motherfucker, you brought me back from the dead

01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:14.940
to talk about shit stories?

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:16.940
He would find it fitting, I think.

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:18.940
Do you think anybody saw...

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.940
Sawdust?

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:22.940
I remember the excitement being like,

01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:24.940
I'm going to be naked outside

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.940
for a second.

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:28.940
I'm really nervous about it.

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:30.940
My yard is fenced in, but the neighbors

01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.940
and could they see through, I was like,

01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:34.940
I don't want anyone to see this.

01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:36.940
I remember thinking that,

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:38.940
and then I still went through with it.

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:40.940
I don't know.

01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:42.940
That's the most adventurous I'd been

01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:44.940
until I was probably in my 20s.

01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:46.940
Until tonight...

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.940
Bring out the stump!

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:50.940
Tonight, we've got a stump in studio!

01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:54.940
Look on the rock!

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:56.940
I really want to share my sympathies

01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:58.940
because I can really picture this stump.

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.940
It's got even a target.

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:02.940
It's kind of blonde wood.

01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:04.940
I'm picturing a dark bark,

01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:06.940
like a rich yellow wood.

01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:08.940
A white oak.

01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:10.940
It was very...

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:12.940
I've never wanted to shit anywhere,

01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:14.940
except the toilet or my pants

01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:16.940
when I was a kid.

01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:18.940
Me too, except for that one time in my life.

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:20.940
And I did it.

01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:22.940
I'm proud of you.

01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:24.940
That's great.

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:26.940
Did you make it right in the center?

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:28.940
Did it look like a queen?

01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:30.940
I wanted to look like a Hershey's kiss

01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:32.940
in the middle of this giant thing.

01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:34.940
You go to a redwood forest

01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:36.940
and they point at the rings and they go,

01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:38.940
Napoleon invades...

01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:40.940
What? Storm's the best deal?

01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:42.940
The Wright brothers

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:44.940
fly their plane to Kitty Hawk

01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:46.940
with the rings on the tree

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:48.940
in the center of it.

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.940
Steve Levy takes a shit,

01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:52.940
but that's not right,

01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:54.940
because that would be the oldest thing.

01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:56.940
And they have to explain that in the placard.

01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:58.940
They're like, sorry.

01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:00.940
Then Steve Levy took a shit,

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:02.940
but not in the stone age.

01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:04.940
So your dad goes,

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:06.940
hey, Steven,

01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:08.940
did you take a shit on the tree stump?

01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:10.940
And you were like, huh?

01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:12.940
Stacking block.

01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:14.940
Hold on, Dad, hold on.

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.940
Did you take a human shit

01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:18.940
on the fucking tree stump?

01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:20.940
Dad, I don't have time for this.

01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:22.940
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:24.940
Did I take a shit? What am I?

01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:26.940
What am I, a fucking animal? I'm your son.

01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:28.940
Can you excuse me?

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:30.940
I got blocks over here.

01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:32.940
I got the A and the B next to each other.

01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:34.940
I'm trying to put the C.

01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:36.940
I just figured out I can put them in the middle.

01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:38.940
Does that mean in order to get high, I have to make a pyramid?

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:40.940
I'm sorry.

01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:42.940
You're sorry? I'm fucking sorry.

01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:44.940
I just wasted a tenth of my life

01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:46.940
with this shit.

01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:48.940
I'm sorry.

01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:50.940
Everybody's like, oh, you're so young.

01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:52.940
Yeah, no shit. That means you're fucking with me

01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:54.940
and draining my life.

01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:56.940
Like, if I was 40,

01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:58.940
I'd be like, yeah, fuck it.

01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:00.940
Let's do nothing all day. Fuck you.

01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:02.940
I just got here. I'm not a fuck-up.

01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:04.940
I'm gonna shit everywhere.

01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:06.940
But I didn't. I didn't know.

01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:08.940
I didn't.

01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:10.940
You know what?

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:12.940
You need to tend your own garden.

01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:14.940
You know what?

01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:16.940
I'm fucking like, I might be a famous pianist.

01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:18.940
You don't know. Don't fuck with me.

01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:20.940
Fuck you. Fuck you.

01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:22.940
Don't look at me like that.

01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:24.940
It's illegal for you to hit me.

01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:26.940
I've got you by the fucking balls.

01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:28.940
Excuse me. I gotta answer the...

01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:30.940
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:32.940
Hello. My name is Officer Davis.

01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:34.940
We got some reports

01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:36.940
of a two-year-old pooping on tree stumps.

01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:38.940
Really?

01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:40.940
Really?

01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:42.940
What? Excuse me?

01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:44.940
What?

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:46.940
Sorry, I don't hear so good.

01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:48.940
My eardrums are still, like, gelatinous membranes.

01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:50.940
We have a report

01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:52.940
that we...

01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:54.940
Someone matching your description was...

01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:56.940
I'm gonna stop you right there. We have a report.

01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:58.940
You know what? Your problem is,

01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:00.940
your problem is you have reports.

01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:02.940
My problem is I have fucking blocks.

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:04.940
Do you want me to refill that, sir?

01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:06.940
Yes, please.

01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:08.940
Thank you.

01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:10.940
We'd like to bring you down...

01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:12.940
I'm supposed to trust this system?

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:14.940
Can we bring you down to the station

01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:16.940
and ask you some questions, young man?

01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:18.940
You can bring me anywhere. I can't fight you back.

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.940
My muscles are pudding.

01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:22.940
Do you want a lawyer up,

01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:24.940
or do you want me to just answer questions?

01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:26.940
I don't know what a lawyer is. Is that the same as a gorilla?

01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:28.940
I don't know.

01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:30.940
I don't know shit, and that's exactly what a jury's gonna find out.

01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:32.940
If you've got nothing...

01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:34.940
If you have nothing to hide,

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.940
then you have no...

01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:38.940
I got plenty to hide.

01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:40.940
Can you seek it? You don't know?

01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:42.940
Everything's hidden from me.

01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:44.940
I don't have any persistence of motion.

01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:46.940
You can hide from me behind a towel.

01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:48.940
Where were you...

01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:50.940
Where were you two and a half hours ago?

01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:52.940
What's time?

01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:54.940
See ya, dude. See ya, buddy.

01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:56.940
You're fucked, and you know it.

01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:58.940
If you had anything on me, I'd be in cuffs.

01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:02.940
Go fuck yourself.

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:04.940
Davis!

01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:06.940
Get in my office, Davis!

01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:08.940
This department, you cost this department

01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:10.940
a million dollars talking to that shit, baby.

01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:12.940
Oh, chief.

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:14.940
Chief, I...

01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:16.940
You keep messing up,

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.940
and it's gonna beat my ass.

01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:20.940
Chief, I...

01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:22.940
I want you to find out who shit on that stuff.

01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:24.940
Chief, I got this motherfucker, chief.

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.940
I fucking got him.

01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:28.940
No, I fucking...

01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:30.940
You give me fucking two hours, I fucking got this kid.

01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:32.940
You cost this department

01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:34.940
two billion dollars on that last case.

01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:36.940
Now, Ia is up my ass.

01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:38.940
Chief, I will...

01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:40.940
I will wager my fucking badge on this case.

01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:42.940
I fucking got this kid.

01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:44.940
I got him. I got him.

01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:46.940
You go talk to that baby.

01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:48.940
We are gonna get fired.

01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:50.940
All right.

01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:52.940
Did he come here?

01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:54.940
Did he come to the house?

01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:56.940
Um...

01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:58.940
Mr...

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.940
There is no Mr...

01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:02.940
Mr. Lee...

01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:04.940
My name is Pookie, Papa, Chichi, Tony.

01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:06.940
Okay.

01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:08.940
What do you want me to call you?

01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:10.940
That's not up to me.

01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:12.940
His name is Stephen.

01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:14.940
Stephen, what did you have for lunch today?

01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:16.940
Do you remember what you had for lunch?

01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:18.940
What did I want to have for lunch?

01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:20.940
Birthday cake. Sorry, I answered the first question.

01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:22.940
What did you eat for lunch today?

01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:24.940
I fucking strained something.

01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:26.940
Veggie something.

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:28.940
What if I told you...

01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:32.940
A choo-choo train. I ate a bunch of lies.

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.940
That's what I ate.

01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:36.940
Sir, I'm gonna show you a picture of a tree.

01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:38.940
Do you recognize this tree stump, sir?

01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:40.940
Sure. Tee-tee.

01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:42.940
Yeah? Yeah, ta-ta.

01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:44.940
What the fuck, dude? Keep trying.

01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:46.940
Tee-tee, ta-ta, whatever the fuck, bro.

01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:48.940
All right. Do you want a nap?

01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:50.940
Do you want a timeout?

01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:52.940
I'll give you a timeout for fucking five to ten years

01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:54.940
for pooping on a tree.

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:56.940
You talk to me like that?

01:28:56.940 --> 01:28:58.940
What?

01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:00.940
What did you just say?

01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:02.940
You talk...

01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:04.940
You talk to me like that again?

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:06.940
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you got the leverage right now?

01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:10.940
I'm sorry. Do you think you have the leverage right now?

01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:12.940
I'm looking at a picture of a tree stump

01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:14.940
that's right out in front of your yard.

01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:16.940
Ahhhhhhhhhhh.

01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:20.940
Great.

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:24.940
Aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:30.940
Thank you.

01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:32.940
Thank you.

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:34.940
Sir, I think your boss likes to talk to you.

01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:36.940
I think our boss likes to talk to you.

01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:38.940
Chief? Chief?

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:40.940
That is an admission of fucking guilt.

01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:42.940
I don't give a goddamn what it was.

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:45.940
These words he was using, what was all that about?

01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:47.940
We got this son of a bitch.

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:49.940
You better get out there and get this conviction.

01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:55.940
Listen, Mr. Leiby, we can go round and round.

01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:57.940
I'd like that.

01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:58.940
Yeah.

01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:03.940
I'd probably go to sleep.

01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:07.940
Whoa, I'm sorry.

01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:09.940
Do I smell something?

01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:16.940
When you just screamed, I think you made a little chocolate poopy.

01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:18.940
Not a crime.

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:26.940
It's not a crime, but what if I told you that we could match that poopy to the poopy on the tree from earlier today?

01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:28.940
Steven, show him.

01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:37.940
We have your mother in here, Mr. Leiby.

01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:41.940
Okay, sorry, give him one second.

01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:43.940
Show him what?

01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:47.940
Show him that you didn't poop your pants or pooped your pants.

01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:49.940
I pooped my pants all the time.

01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:55.940
I know, but right now, I mean, this is the only way you can prove your innocence.

01:30:55.940 --> 01:31:02.940
What if I told both of you that we found trace elements of silly petty around the poop?

01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:10.940
What if I could match that silly petty to the silly petty that's almost certainly adhered to your penis right now?

01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:15.940
It's my front yard. I've been there a thousand times.

01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:18.940
My advice to you right now is to lawyer up, sir, because we've got you.

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:21.940
Well, my advice to you is it's a little late to tell me that.

01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:23.940
Like, you didn't read me any rights.

01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:26.940
We read you your rights. You just don't know how to read.

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:29.940
Well, you know how to read. I don't know how to listen.

01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:32.940
Yeah, if you knew how to listen, you'd understand what I'm fucking telling you right now.

01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:35.940
You needed to teach me to hear my rights.

01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:36.940
All right.

01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:37.940
And you didn't. You just read up to me.

01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:40.940
I'm going to read you the ABCs of going to jail.

01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:42.940
I'm going to giggle and spit.

01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:47.940
Maybe your pant... Maybe Mr. Panda could be your lawyer.

01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:50.940
Maybe Mr. Panda Pants could be your lawyer.

01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:52.940
Maybe Mr. Panda Pants could be your lawyer.

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:54.940
Hey, Mr. Panda Pants.

01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:57.940
These people can't see Mr. Panda Pants.

01:31:57.940 --> 01:31:59.940
If you believe...

01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:03.940
That's right. If you believe, I'll represent you in court.

01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:12.940
Mr. Panda Pants, I even need to put up with this shit,

01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:16.940
or can I just take another shit, fall asleep, and...

01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:17.940
What?

01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:18.940
...to be a dentist.

01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:22.940
If you can count to five, you can go back to sleep, my man.

01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:24.940
Yeah.

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:28.940
Mr. Levy, if you can count to five, as your lawyer advised you,

01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:30.940
then you can go back to sleep.

01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.940
And this case never happened.

01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:34.940
Talk to five in my sleep.

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:35.940
Well, let's hear it.

01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:36.940
Yeah, that's fine.

01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:38.940
Don't have to do it for you, don't have to do it for anybody.

01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:39.940
No.

01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:40.940
Just say anything on the bottom of it.

01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:42.940
Sir, you don't have to do anything.

01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:43.940
You don't have to do anything.

01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:44.940
That's right, motherfucker.

01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:45.940
Glad you got here.

01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:47.940
Why don't you come here by stroller?

01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:54.940
That's enough apple juice.

01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:56.940
Give me a beat.

01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:57.940
Don't give me a beat.

01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.940
You know, at a certain point, he's going to leave.

01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:00.940
Everyone's going to leave.

01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:02.940
It's going to be me and you.

01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:03.940
You know what?

01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:04.940
I'm going to remember who fucking backed me up.

01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:06.940
I'm going to be a fucking pianist.

01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:07.940
I'm going to write a concerto.

01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:08.940
It's going to tear you to pieces.

01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:11.940
You're going to kill yourself.

01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:13.940
I don't even need lyrics.

01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:15.940
You're going to tell C-Sharp, that's about me.

01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:20.940
Cush.

01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:21.940
That's how good I'm going to be,

01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:23.940
and that's how fucked up you are.

01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:27.940
Are you still here?

01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:30.940
This whole thing's being recorded right now.

01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:36.940
It's all being baby monitored, too.

01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:39.940
I was born recorded.

01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:41.940
I'm part of the fucking new generation, bitch.

01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:44.940
I got no conscience.

01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:46.940
That fucking rapture happened a long time ago.

01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:47.940
I was born without a soul.

01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:48.940
Just say you pooped in the tree.

01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:50.940
Just say you can walk out of here today

01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:51.940
if you say you pooped in the tree.

01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:53.940
Tell me what to say.

01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:56.940
Why don't we just look at the baby cam?

01:33:56.940 --> 01:34:00.940
What?

01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.940
The baby cam is recording everything.

01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:03.940
It will back it up.

01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:04.940
What baby?

01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:05.940
You got a baby cam in the front yard?

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.940
You got them all over the place.

01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:08.940
You fucking prick.

01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:09.940
You fucked us.

01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:10.940
You fucked us.

01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:11.940
We're fucking dead.

01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:12.940
Good job.

01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:13.940
We're fucking dead.

01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:14.940
You're dead.

01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:15.940
We're gonna take you away.

01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:16.940
You think I go down alone?

01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:19.940
You fucking mook?

01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:21.940
Who the fuck put the food in me

01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:23.940
that turned into that shit?

01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:24.940
Who the fuck cut the tree down?

01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:25.940
Whose yard is it?

01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:26.940
Who called the cops?

01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:27.940
You fucked.

01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:28.940
You're fucked.

01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:29.940
You're fucked.

01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:30.940
Oh, you're fucked.

01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:31.940
You want me to count?

01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:33.940
I'm gonna sing.

01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:35.940
Yes, it was me.

01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:36.940
I'd like to talk.

01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:37.940
I got it.

01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:38.940
All right.

01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:39.940
You wanna wrap it up?

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:40.940
What?

01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:41.940
You wanna wrap it?

01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:43.940
No, don't.

01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:47.940
Even as a baby, I know that's not the way to end.

01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:48.940
That's not...

01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:50.940
You can sing it out.

01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.940
No, I sing as like a gangster term for talk.

01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:53.940
Okay.

01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:55.940
I didn't mean I'm gonna sing a song.

01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:57.940
I know what you meant.

01:34:57.940 --> 01:34:58.940
I know what you meant.

01:34:58.940 --> 01:34:59.940
Oh, God.

01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:01.940
All right, we won't look at it.

01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:02.940
We won't look at the police.

01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:03.940
Yeah, don't look at my shit.

01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:05.940
We'll just have the police move in.

01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:08.940
Why don't you just sit down and move in?

01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.940
I never gonna go.

01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:11.940
What do you think being born is?

01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:12.940
It's me moving in.

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:13.940
Give me a fucking break, man.

01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:15.940
I shit on your tree, okay?

01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:16.940
You cut it down.

01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:17.940
How do you get the tree feels?

01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:18.940
Whoa, whoa.

01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:19.940
We just got it.

01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:20.940
Yeah, I know.

01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:21.940
I confess.

01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:22.940
We got it.

01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:23.940
We got a confession.

01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:24.940
You got that baby to tell the truth?

01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:25.940
Don't you lie to me, David?

01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:26.940
I got departments, more departments, and a grocery store.

01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:27.940
No, we have...

01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:28.940
They're yelling at me.

01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:29.940
We have it on baby cancer.

01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:30.940
We have it on baby cancer.

01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:31.940
Bring them into the station and make them confess.

01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:32.940
We got a confession.

01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:33.940
You got that baby to tell the truth?

01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:34.940
Don't you lie to me, David?

01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:35.940
I got departments, more departments, and a grocery store.

01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:40.940
They're yelling at me.

01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:40.940
We have it on baby cancer.

01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:40.940
Bring them into the station and make them confess to me.

01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:43.940
Or it's your ass, David.

01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:44.940
You're boss.

01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:45.940
Mr. Levy, I hate to...

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:46.940
I know you're only two years old.

01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:47.940
I understand.

01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:48.940
I can over here.

01:35:48.940 --> 01:36:00.940
We're in a scene about a baby pooping criminal, and this police commissioner is still in

01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:01.940
the show.

01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:10.940
I want to know more about him, and I'm the baby.

01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:16.940
We could probably take two years off your sentence if you go and confess to him.

01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:18.940
Do you know what they say about babies?

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.940
Two years is a life sentence.

01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:21.940
Yeah.

01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:25.940
Dissolve to police commissioner's office.

01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:29.940
Are these real Skittles?

01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:31.940
I think they're breath mints.

01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:34.940
You can touch anything you want from here.

01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:35.940
Wand around.

01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:41.940
But why did you shit on the tree?

01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:42.940
Why?

01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:47.940
Such an easy question for you, isn't it?

01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:50.940
See from your placard on the wall, you went to what?

01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:51.940
West Point?

01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:52.940
I did.

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:56.940
I suppose all the furniture was where you could hold it.

01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:57.940
Well, you waddled.

01:36:57.940 --> 01:36:59.940
I walk.

01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:03.940
Do you remember there was a time when you couldn't?

01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:05.940
Of course I do.

01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:09.940
I had to ask people for things.

01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:13.940
Accountability is why I yell at David so much.

01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:15.940
Can I smoke?

01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:17.940
Of course.

01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:21.940
I think we both should.

01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:26.940
Commissioner, you and I both have a world of fucking problem here.

01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:28.940
My diaper is a literal one.

01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:30.940
Yours is the city.

01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:32.940
They're both full of shit.

01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:34.940
They both need to change.

01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:37.940
You change me without changing yours.

01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:41.940
You can have a lot of shit on your hands.

01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:44.940
And I'll admit, I'm in no position to stick to my guns.

01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:46.940
Can't pick a gun up.

01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:48.940
Ways as much as I do.

01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:54.940
I wish I could change that, but laws.

01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:56.940
But I have an idea.

01:37:56.940 --> 01:38:02.940
Two days later, at the Statue of Liberty...

01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:19.940
A lot of babies go through the academy.

01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:21.940
But most of them don't make it.

01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:22.940
Make it.

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:28.940
Make it.

01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.940
It's just that a baby becomes a cop.

01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:37.940
And that's how you become a cop, is that the Statue of Liberty?

01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:40.940
Don't touch it.

01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:41.940
Seal it up.

01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:42.940
That's exactly how it happened.

01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:45.940
Verbado.

01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:48.940
I love it when you become a cop no matter where you live,

01:38:48.940 --> 01:39:05.300
the statue of liberty? What's our job? To protect the statue or just liberty? I mean, look, I've

01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:09.820
never seen Family Guy, isn't that just their bit? What, the baby can talk, right? And he's just like,

01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:13.500
oh, I'm a baby. Yeah, who cares? I thought that's what you were doing. Yeah, well, I don't know.

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:21.700
Ask my therapist. I don't watch fucking Family Guy. Shots fired, fired, fired. Shots fired to my

01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:26.580
therapist. I'm like, watch the fucking show. God damn it, I've given you, look, would you just watch

01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:32.500
Rick and Morty? Jesus Christ, fucking therapist. She's just doing it because she knows, we've been

01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:37.340
over this. Why does she not watch the show? I'm like, Jesus Christ, I'm having such a towel,

01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:41.100
I gotta weigh this and then that. And I'm trying to think of, oh, wait a minute. And she's like,

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:45.060
you know, Peter Griffin has the thing in his, I'm like, who the fuck are you talking about? What

01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:51.220
the fuck are you talking about? What are you talking about? Peter Griffin. I want to know,

01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:56.500
what was, I want to know what her example was. She has some example, like he had an angel and a

01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:59.660
devil. I'm like, that's the one reference you don't even have to make. But I don't want to make

01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:07.140
her sound like a bad therapist. She just doesn't understand television. She understands the human

01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:11.900
brain. You know, but then she's like TV. She's like, you know, it's funny. It reminds me of this

01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:22.460
thing. There was this land of the lost. I'm like, bitch, update your Netflix. It's not how Netflix

01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:27.980
works. You don't update it. And then the show's getting newer. It's not how it works. Land of the

01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:39.300
lost update girls, girls. The sleep stacks turn into millennial women finding themselves in New

01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:47.220
York. All right, you know, look, if it's that hard to steal focus, it means the show's going well.

01:40:47.220 --> 01:41:04.060
The soup's almost done. Rob's right. All soup is inevitably almost done. I set you up and you

01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:07.380
were fucking let's end the show. I guess just reminding you this one thing like there's this

01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:13.500
podcast called the no sleep podcast. But it's like it's been on for like 1112 seasons. Like I'm

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:18.260
obsessed with like creepy pasta like podcasts. I was listening to this thing called creepy. But

01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:23.500
then I realized that he keeps referencing but it's for some reason Canadians are like, like as a

01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:28.260
nationality like Canadians like are the ones that are really into creepy pasta like it's sort of

01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:33.740
like like the Irish are into bootlegging in the 20s. Like it's like the Canadian will look back

01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:38.620
when they're the creepy pasta phenomenon of course was being trafficked into podcasting by the

01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:46.540
Canadians for some reason. And it's so funny like when people are I just it's so hard to scare me

01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:54.420
when you say a boot like it's so funny. You can't fucking do it. It's like, oh, and then I looked

01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:59.980
in the monkey paw was a ruined the thing. And it's just like it's so adorable. It's a Canadian.

01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:06.580
What's creepy? What's creepy pasta? It's just I think that's just shorthand for like ghost stories

01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:12.580
that the the in the incarnation of like forum posts and stuff where you are sometimes the line

01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:17.140
between reality is blurred as they always were with with campfire stories but now in the digital age

01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:25.740
creepy pasta. I think it comes from copy paste. So like copy pasta which is a copied and pasted text

01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:35.020
block. I think the earmark of a good one. Just information. Why would you what why would you do

01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:39.820
that? Why would you do no one would do anything? It just evolved. There's just kids like telling each

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:44.100
other ghost stories online. You know, same thing as a campfire, but they don't have campfires anymore

01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:52.140
because the world is on fire. Did they have to do with food? No, because I don't know it just

01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:56.700
derives language fucking thrives. It just fucking turns into other shit. Language just lives a

01:42:56.700 --> 01:43:05.100
creepy text block that's been copied and pasted. Creepy pasta. But I will say this. The one I listen

01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:14.700
to creepy. There's a guy who goes, this is creepy. The biggest collection of the most. Can I just

01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:20.300
pull it up and pull it up because because the thing is the way that the guy says the word pasta in

01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:25.740
creepy pasta. It's like there's something like he can't escape like he's he's and when I say old

01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:31.980
man is my age, but I'm just saying like he's so old that he like he can't say that phrase creepy

01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:40.700
pasta without really making it sound delicious. Where he's like, I never like I just want to I

01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:45.980
did I like live just indulge me and because I'm in a good mood and thank you. Thank you all for

01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:56.940
another week of you know in one of these days I may have something really specific to thank you

01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:01.180
guys for like over the weeks and things there may be certain battles that have to be fought in

01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:05.740
silence and things and I really owe you guys a fucking lot and we'll talk about it on the other

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:16.940
side of of a tunnel that's going to be worth it. But I try to play the the intro of let's hear how

01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:22.460
delicious this pasta is. I'm afraid my battery is going to go out but that'll be just cool. All right

01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:28.700
you know what Schrab? You're just a little bit too batteryy. Didn't you get an expensive one?

01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:33.500
What are they going to make? Didn't you get an expensive power? People that just the podcast

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:40.380
app is so bad and it's fun to watch you go through that live. It's so it's really bad. I just want

01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:45.260
to also I wrote one for the if you're a patreon subscriber that he'll do one that I and I wrote

01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:53.420
one and did he read it? Well he recorded it. Oh cool. Levy can we have a second phone on this?

01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:58.780
Yeah. Spencer's got his phone now. I just set it down though. The only reason is this point.

01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:06.620
I was going to help but I was like nah. Well because you knew it was going to be hard. Well I just

01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:12.940
thought that you were most of the way there but. I think you know I think it's largely like. Oh

01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:16.140
you have bad signal in here huh? My phone's at five percent and there's no signal and it's

01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:21.980
ten o'clock. Well it's just let's. We'll see you for next time. Oh yeah. Sorry if I come back now.

01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:28.060
I have a lot to talk about with creepy pasta podcasts. It's been my new thing.

01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:31.900
Why don't Dan why don't you just cast one spell in D&D right now? Like just like

01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:39.580
let's just say that we're in the middle of a thing and you cast one spell. Do I have any spells left?

01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:48.540
No. Well let's say that Dan had rested in here and he has one. No let's say Dan rested. That's

01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:56.700
fucked up. I'm sick of this resting. You have spell slots. You need to rest. All right. Eight

01:45:56.700 --> 01:46:04.540
hours. Who has a spell among us right now? No one. Well you all have. You don't fucking DM from

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:13.180
the bottom. The PM. You don't DM from the PM. You don't DM from the PM. I'm top of the bottom right

01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:22.620
now. You don't. Well then Dan use a weapon. Like do it do it. I use my cudgel. Oh it's great.

01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:27.340
Yeah. That'll make sense without context. There you go. You hit him right in the dick.

01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:34.140
We're all so lucky I didn't drive here tonight. Yeah man. Why would happen?

01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:47.180
I drank a lot. Tonight. Every night. Okay. I just recently got a car. Okay. Yeah. I got to not

01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:57.580
drive. I feel lucky. I feel so lucky. I feel so lucky that you didn't drive. And your phone is at

01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:14.220
5% I feel lucky. Have a little soup. Hey that people think that takes you home tonight ladies and

01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:19.580
gentlemen. Harmontown is no longer in session. Thank you to so many people but Jeff Davis,

01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:38.860
time. A big round of applause for yourself. I've been your cop killer Brandon Johnson. Good night.

01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:48.860
Church we love you.

01:47:48.860 --> 01:48:00.860
Did you get any of that?
