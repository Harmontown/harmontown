{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:04.000\nYeah!\n\n00:04.000 --> 00:09.000\nMake some noise for yourself for coming into downtown Los Angeles.\n\n00:09.000 --> 00:15.000\nLadies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session. How are you tonight?\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:20.000\nYou look so much better than that. How are you tonight?\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:24.000\nYeah!\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:29.000\nLet me bring to the stage the master king of all he surveys.\n\n00:29.000 --> 00:33.000\nIt's a gamer king, Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:40.000\nYeah!\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:44.000\nCouldn't do a show without him. Lord knows he needs to hear you.\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:46.000\nGive him some claps when he gets out here.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:56.000\nLadies and gentlemen, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:01.000\nI am Brandon Jackson.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:08.000\nYeah, wrap to the east, wrap to the west, wrap to your knees, wrap to your chest, wrap to your feet, wrap to your shoes, wrap to the rhythm, and the news.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:09.000\nWhat?\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:13.000\nYou thought I was going to say blues, but I mixed it up. Ain't it the same thing, Dan?\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:16.000\nNo.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:19.000\nThat was just me realizing how offbeat I was the whole time.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:32.000\nLike, no. Okay. Thank you for coming.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:34.000\nAll right, well.\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:35.000\nLet's get down.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:38.000\nYeah. Not a lot to share. I don't know.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:43.000\nIt's been working hard. You know, it's fun.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:45.000\nYeah, you're back, back, back. Right?\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:48.000\nWhat week is this? Is this like four weeks in of Rick and Morty?\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:53.000\nIt's a little more than that, but now it's like really like in stage of like, oh, it's good to be back to work.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:59.000\nBut now it's really like, I mean, we're, we're, things are running like a fucking machine.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:00.000\nYeah.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:02.000\nI'm not going to lie. It is a new thing for me.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:10.000\nLike, I, like, it's, it's just, it really is continuing to be this thing where I'm like, are you going to fuck this up?\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:12.000\nLike, it's up to you to fuck this up.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:24.000\nLike, just like what, and that's when your religion comes into it. You're like, do I believe that the universe is structured in a way that if everything is going okay for a week that it has to go to fucking shit and get all fucked up?\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:27.000\nLike, you either have to believe that.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:36.000\nAnd it's like, like, is it okay to just be like, well, maybe, maybe your definition of things getting fucked up will elevate or something.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:37.000\nI don't know.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:38.000\nYes.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:39.000\nI haven't figured it out.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:40.000\nHigher end fucking up.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:43.000\nAnd I do know that it's not, it's not, it's not supposed to be you.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:47.000\nIf you have, if you have no shoes for a week, I'm going to riff a metaphor.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:48.000\nIt's going to go good.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:50.000\nIt's going to, I'm going to nail this.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:52.000\nYou have no shoes for a week.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:55.000\nAnd then you're like, this is pretty fucked up, but it's normal.\n\n02:55.000 --> 03:00.000\nSo during that week, you're like, I got no shoes and Maggie likes me.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:01.000\nAnd she's like, hi, Lloyd.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nAnd you're like, no shoes, Lloyd.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:04.000\nThat's what they call me.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nWe don't have really caveman names.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:07.000\nWho said we were cavemen?\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:08.000\nWhat kind of image?\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:10.000\nJust because I have no shoes.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:11.000\nThere's lots of people that don't have them.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:12.000\nMaybe we're in a weird country.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:13.000\nA weird country.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:14.000\nOur names are Maggie and Lloyd.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:15.000\nCan we not get into this, Maggie?\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:16.000\nYou fucking bitch.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:20.000\nYou have to pick everything apart and problematize it.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:22.000\nI got no shoes.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:29.000\nAnd so then you go home and go, you say to your living girlfriend who always knew Maggie\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:33.000\nwas probably an issue, but also you guys have an understanding because you knew it was like\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:35.000\nyou moved in actually more out of convenience.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:37.000\nAnd so anyways, you're not dishonest.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:39.000\nBut she's like, how was your day?\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:41.000\nLike shitty, gotten a little tussle.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:43.000\nWhat was it, Maggie?\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:44.000\nBecause you want to fuck her?\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:45.000\nNo.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nAnd I got no shoes.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:49.000\nAnd then she's like, this is starting about names.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:51.000\nAnd you're like, so you had a bad week, right?\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:53.000\nAnd you go like, OK, I had a bad week.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:56.000\nNo shoes guy had a bad week.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:57.000\nOK.\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:58.000\nI think this metaphor is still going to work.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nYou got this.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:03.000\nSo then the next week you wake up.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nThere's shoes.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:11.000\nLet's say you have a caveman holiday called Shoemus.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:13.000\nAll the cavemen get shoes.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:14.000\nNo, correction.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:16.000\nNone of the cavemen get shoes.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:17.000\nMost of them get a BB gun.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:18.000\nYou get shoes.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:19.000\nYou know why?\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:20.000\nBecause you're a good caveman.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:21.000\nYou did your fucking time.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nYou deserve shoes.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:24.000\nWhat are you going to do with a BB gun?\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.000\nThere's mammoth out there.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:28.000\nI know my history.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:29.000\nI know my anthropology.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nDon't fuck with me.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:33.000\nSo you put on the shoes.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nNow you're fucking rolling.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:37.000\nThese are the Tesla of cavemen shoes.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:38.000\nYes.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nAnd you're like, wow, feels good.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nLike rattlesnakes can't bite me.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:45.000\nSabertooth tigers can't outrun me.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:46.000\nOK.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.000\nI'm sure they can outrun me.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nThat's how you know why.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:51.000\nYou know what?\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:54.000\nI don't owe you this explanation, but I'll say this.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:58.000\n90% of sabertooth tiger deaths happen because the caveman\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:01.000\nin the midst of creeping by the sabertooth tiger,\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:04.000\nwent ow, because he stepped on a sharp stone.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:07.000\nThat's a fact.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nSo shoes means life.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nIt means you're lucky.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:12.000\nYou're privileged.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nI had no shoes.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:15.000\nI was, what was my name?\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:16.000\nLloyd?\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:17.000\nYep.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:18.000\nThe caveman.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:19.000\nI now have shoes.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:24.000\nSo if Lloyd starts to think, OK, now I got shoes.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:30.000\nSo now that means, right, that I'm going to get caveman cancer.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:34.000\nThat doesn't do anybody any good.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:36.000\nThat's not a good thing for him to think.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nThat's not even his expertise.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nWe'd rather him think about other things.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:42.000\nLike the light bulb hasn't been invented.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:46.000\nYou're saying when Lloyd had no shoes, his fear was the tiger,\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:47.000\nthe sabertooth.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nYeah.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nBut then when Lloyd got shoes, his new fear was cancer.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:51.000\nYeah.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:52.000\nCaveman cancer.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:56.000\nAnd I think, you know, look, I am the first person to agree\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:59.000\nthat Lloyd's podcast is going to get a little less entertaining.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:04.000\nOnce he stops going to the ins and outs of his fear of sabertooth tigers.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:08.000\nI do agree that that was a big part of the appeal.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:13.000\nBut, you know, assuming the podcasts aren't what keep us happy and alive.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:19.000\nLike, you shouldn't be like, oh, God, a cave anvil is going to fall on my head.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nThat's what, but Lloyd lived with a girlfriend.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:25.000\nWell, that sounds like a happy relationship.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:28.000\nWhat do they mean they're living together, but they're what?\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:29.000\nWhat?\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:30.000\nCome on.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nThat sounded like they needed to take that to a cave couple therapist.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:38.000\nPerhaps perhaps the thing that will keep Lloyd from worrying about cancer is the fact\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:42.000\nthat he's got people around him who are also worried.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:43.000\nOh, wait.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:44.000\nOh, you that was a left turn.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:45.000\nOkay.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:46.000\nThat was a left turn.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:47.000\nI thought I was going to say blue.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:48.000\nDid you?\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:53.000\nTo take his shoes and run as far away that he had to go to a place where there's no tigers\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:58.000\nor people and just be in a field and like lay down and die from sleeping too much.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nAnd make great television.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nThat's always been a part of it.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:07.000\nAnd I have never, ever, ever said like, I've never, look, I've been doing this for 20 years.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:08.000\nI have never made the television.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nI make part of anyone's problem.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:11.000\nI've never done that.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:16.000\nLike I, I, I, I, you find me an episode of a TV thing I produce where it's like, oh,\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nI can see someone's upset about Twinkies.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:22.000\nYou know, I don't, I don't fucking, that's to hack shit.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:23.000\nI don't fucking like blow your mind.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:27.000\nI tell you timeless stories about struggles and humanity.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:28.000\nShoes.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:33.000\nI use these great metaphors to like reveal things about.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nI don't even remember where I'm going.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:38.000\nI'm trying to, I'm just saying this is part, part three.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:41.000\nI think since, since I revealed that I'm too happy.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:42.000\nYeah.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:43.000\nIt's a problem.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nOkay.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nBut you're getting, here's the good thing about getting happy is you're getting happier\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:48.000\nas your problem grows.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nWell, I'm excited to talk about it.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:53.000\nBecause it feels like also in your therapist goes, you need to learn how to be happy.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nYou're like, you mean brag?\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:59.000\nBecause I was told that's how you get cancer.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:04.000\nAnd she's like, no, that's not how you get cancer.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:09.000\nDo you mean like Jack Ruby comes to the prison and like, or wait, no, Jack Ruby got injected\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:10.000\nwith cancer, right?\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nBecause he, Kennedy.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:13.000\nOkay.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:16.000\nDo you think you're going to win?\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nJack Ruby?\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nYeah.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:22.000\nDo you think you're going to win the happiness battle?\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:23.000\nBecause it sounds like.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:24.000\nNo.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:25.000\nBecause you know what, you know what, I have a feeling, you know what I think is going\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:26.000\nto happen?\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:32.000\nI think my body is going to start dying.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:33.000\nAnd we'll dress it up.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:40.000\nWe'll call it a stroke or a, or a lung collapse or a, or a gout.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:41.000\nRight.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:45.000\nAnd then, oh, and then everybody would go, oh, he's dying.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:48.000\nAnd then I'll go, oh, don't worry about me.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nI lived a good life.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:51.000\nWhy are you all talking like that?\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:52.000\nI don't know.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nBecause, you know, I don't want to, I don't want to mock it.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:58.000\nI said, you're home, I want you to drink my flowers.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.000\nI heard you were dying.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:03.000\nDon't you think winning is, I guess I, I guess I'm like nine years old.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nLike, don't you think winning is like, you don't die?\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:08.000\nThat's what, like, that's every game you play.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nLike tag, you're it.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:11.000\nYou lost.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nTag, I'm never it.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:14.000\nI won forever.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:17.000\nSo if you play hide-and-seek and you stick yourself into a storm drain,\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:22.000\nit doesn't matter if snails are crawling over your face, you won hide-and-seek.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nBut you lost it life.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:29.000\nWell, tell that to the person who said life was about being sought.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:33.000\nTell that to Professor Seekman and his fucking model of the universe.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:37.000\nI just want to see you coming out from under a bush with slugs on your face going, I won!\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nOh man, I was the king of that shit.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nLike, they play flashlight tag.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nI'm like, I will go where no light will go.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nSee, it's easy for you to brag.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:49.000\nSee, it's easy for you to crash in my lungs and a smile on my face.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:52.000\nWe won flashlight tag and we lost.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nWe sure did, buddy, we sure did.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:59.000\nYou hid somewhere, some people were afraid to shine a flashlight.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:05.000\nCongratulations, the joke's on you, everyone just wants to stop playing.\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nThere's girls here.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:10.000\nYeah, I would hide.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:11.000\nI knew how to hide.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nWe talked about this.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:18.000\nYou guys think when you're kid, you're not claustrophobic, right?\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:22.000\nWe used to hide in fucking weird cupboards and shit.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nWe'd be like, the weirder the better.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:29.000\nYou'd tuck your leg and be like, man, I wish I could lock this from the outside\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nso that nobody would swallow the key.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:34.000\nBecause your instinct is to never be found.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:38.000\nAnd I think it's because you're a kid and you don't know that that's a coffin.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:44.000\nLike, you're at a certain age, I'm going to say like 17 or something.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:49.000\nYou're not quite like gripping mortality, but you watch your first serpent in the rainbow kind of movie\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:54.000\nand you're like, how come that guy's going like this and screaming inside of the coffin?\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:58.000\nAnd then that forces you to go, well, I'm going to have to decode why this character's acting like this.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nAll right, I'm in a box.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:01.000\nI can't get out.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:07.000\nThere's nothing but, oh, God, oh, Jesus, God, oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, God, being buried alive, oh, my God.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:10.000\nWe all end up dead.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nOh, my God, being unable to move.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nI got to a point.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:17.000\nDan's grabbing his sunglasses.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:20.000\nWe do a podcast part two.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nYou say that they're $300?\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:25.000\nOh, they're $300.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nDan threw them into the ice.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nI bought them on New Year's Eve.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:36.000\nI was already high.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:39.000\nThe store wasn't open late.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:44.000\nThe sun was out, obviously, or I wouldn't...\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:47.000\nBut I was like, I'm high.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:48.000\nThat was a good day.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nI like New Year's Eve.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:54.000\nYou started it out getting high and then were like, I'm so high I should get some sunglasses.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:59.000\nYeah, I went to Fred Siegel with my girlfriend and I was like, let's get some crazy shit for tonight.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nAnd then I was like, how about some sunglasses?\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:04.000\nYeah, but what about being rich?\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nAnd I was like, what if they were $300?\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:10.000\nAnd I was like, maybe I'll wear them again.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:15.000\nMy $1,000 glasses that helped me see because those are gone.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:16.000\nI don't know where those are.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:17.000\nI lost those.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:18.000\nYeah.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:19.000\nThat's not your problem.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:20.000\nWell, it's hard.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nI don't know.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nThat's why I wore my glasses all the time.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:25.000\nI was supposed to just wear them while I was driving.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nBut then it's like, you have to carry a case or some shit.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:30.000\nAnd it's like, well, I'm not going to do any of this.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:34.000\nI don't understand, I know the answer is 100%.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:38.000\nI'm not going to ask how many of my audience wears glasses.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:39.000\nI know it's 100%.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:48.000\nBut of you, let's say by applause, how many of you walk around with a case for your glasses?\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nYeah, that's a lot.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:51.000\nThat feels healthy.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:55.000\nI don't think all of those people are serial killers.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nThat's good moral applause.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:58.000\nYeah.\n\n12:58.000 --> 12:59.000\nI understand.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:02.000\nI lost $1,000.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:05.000\nI went and got things that cost $1,000.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nAnd I treat them like they're garbage, but they're not.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nThey're $1,000.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:11.000\nIt's almost like the case makes them harder.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:15.000\nYou're just doing it to make them bulkier so that you don't lose them.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:18.000\nBut yeah, I mean, that's so you could put it in your pocket or whatever.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nBut I'm never going to do anything like that.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:23.000\nSo it's just like holding a small log or something.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:24.000\nIt's done.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nI just feel like an asshole.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:31.000\nJust figure this shit out or do they, they're rich and we can't see.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:32.000\nYeah.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nThey got us right where they want us.\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:40.000\nOur next guest is we want it by popular demand.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:43.000\nA lot of people said last episode, they're like, Dan, that was amazing.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:44.000\nWow.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:49.000\nJust amazing and wow.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:50.000\nAwesome.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nWhere were you by the way?\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:58.000\nDo you understand that every time you're not here fucking Schrab is out of control?\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.000\nIs that true?\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\nYeah.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:02.000\nDid you listen to it?\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:06.000\nLike he just like, he can't, I'll be, I'll be like, you know what's crazy about mortality\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nis like, mortality.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:13.000\nAnd I just like, like, you need that.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nI can't compete with that.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nAnd then they're all like, he's great.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:20.000\nAnd like, I can't argue with that.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.000\nI'm a bad guy.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:25.000\nBut then I'm like, what was the quintessential one?\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:29.000\nI was like, I was like, oh, do you think about death as a human?\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:32.000\nAnd he's like, as a human, you're not, you're not an animal.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:33.000\nYou're a human.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:37.000\nAnd he just went off for like, you know how he does that thing where it doesn't, you\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:40.000\nknow, it doesn't, he doesn't wait to see if it worked or not.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:44.000\nHe like, he just, he just leans in and that's why it works.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:45.000\nYeah.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:46.000\nYeah.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:49.000\nBecause if he did it and it didn't work and then he leaned in, you'd be like, no sale.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:50.000\nBut he just fucking leans in.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:53.000\nHe's like, he's like, you go, hey, do you understand?\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:58.000\nAs opposed to over sit, as opposed to over sit, as opposed to over sit.\n\n14:58.000 --> 14:59.000\nUnderstand?\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:05.000\nNot over sit, over sit, over sit, as opposed to over sit.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:09.000\nYou said understand, but did you say over sit?\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nSee, it worked on you.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:20.000\nBut now, now try this one.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:21.000\nHey, do you understand?\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:25.000\nYou mean as opposed to over sit?\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:29.000\nWell, you're laughing because of, you're laughing at the fact that I nailed it.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:30.000\nMy point.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:31.000\nAnyways.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:38.000\nAll right.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:41.000\nAll right.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:44.000\nWell, let's bring out the kid from the alley from last week is what I was talking about.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:46.000\nMr. Jeff Davis is here.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:56.000\nYes.\n\n15:56.000 --> 16:18.000\nJeff Davis, ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Davis.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.000\nOh, no.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nI thought you were going to bring out a trap.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:22.000\nNo, because that wouldn't have worked.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:23.000\nSee, I'm a craftsman.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:24.000\nI don't care.\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:25.000\nLike I'm helping him.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:28.000\nI'm like, what would help Schrab in terms of timing?\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nLike, I was like, well, don't do that.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:31.000\nAnd then he did that.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nI was like, well, let's buffer it.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nWhy are you wearing sunglasses?\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:41.000\nI had some work done.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:44.000\nI had a cool ectomy.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nAnd I don't want, it hasn't, it's.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nYou took the cool out of yourself?\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nYeah.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:52.000\nSo I'm, so I don't know why I would just mitigate it.\n\n16:52.000 --> 17:03.000\nI told the story on this podcast of like, I had a therapist and\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:08.000\nand I was telling, I know I told this, but then she, I was like talking about my childhood\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nand then I looked up and she had like tears coming down her face.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nI was like, why are you crying?\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nShe's like, well, it's a very emotional story.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:15.000\nI'm like, no, it's not.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:16.000\nIt's not.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:17.000\nLike, and I'm not being a cling on.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nI'm like, I'll tell you what's emotional.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nI'm a fucking professional storyteller.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:25.000\nAnd, and she's like, well, maybe not to you.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nProfessional therapist.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nI know, I think I know what's powerful.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nAnd I was like, all right, well, see you again.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nSame time next week.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:37.000\nI came back next time and she was like, well, how's your thing with your sled?\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:38.000\nNo, that's great.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:39.000\nIt says Rosebud on it.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:40.000\nIt was going through.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:43.000\nI don't, I'm making up that making up a therapy session.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:47.000\nWhat if, what if, what if in Citizen Kane, he just had a therapist?\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:50.000\nLike in the middle of the movie, he's just like, I had this sled as Rosebud.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:55.000\nAnd she's like, well, see, it's like, you know what?\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:56.000\nI'm going to go home to my wife.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nTell her it's okay for her to go out.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\nShe was crying for less than honest reasons.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:01.000\nSo then she, yeah.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:05.000\nAnd so she goes like, by the way, really embarrassed about this.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nYou asked about the tears coming down my face.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:12.000\nI had had some work done and I was embarrassed because it's a vanity thing.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:15.000\nSo I lied in the moment and I feel bad about that.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:19.000\nAnd I said, well, I probably didn't say, but I said,\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:23.000\nI said the way we say in our heads when we're just,\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:24.000\nwhen we're just going to walk away and never go back.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nYou mean you were like?\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:26.000\nYeah.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:27.000\nI was, I was like.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:28.000\nYou were all like.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:29.000\nI'm pretty sure.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nWere you all like or were you just like?\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:34.000\nI think I was, I think I was nothing like because I think I was like,\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nokay, sure.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nAnd just never went back.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:43.000\nBut I'm like, you mean you more importantly, you like, like I said,\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:44.000\nwhy are you crying?\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:49.000\nAnd you're like specifically because of the emotional quality of the story,\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:53.000\nyou pay me to listen to and understand and analyze.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:54.000\nLike that's fucked up.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nYeah.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:58.000\nLike lying is, if your plumber comes over and he's like, oh,\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nit looks like you took a big shit and you're like, don't judge.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:01.000\nAnd he's like, I won't.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:02.000\nI'm a plumber.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nI'm just going to get the shit out and you give me 50 bucks and I'll be gone.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nI'm sorry to offend plumbers.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:09.000\nI don't mean to make your occupation sound cheap or fucking craftless.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:10.000\nI know it's hard.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:13.000\nBut I was in Boston.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:22.000\nAnd, but while he's doing it, if he's like, and you're like, hey,\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nplumber, why are you crying?\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nAnd he's like, nothing.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:31.000\nAnd you're like, well, okay, but it's fucked up.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:35.000\nIf he goes, just your shit stinks.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nThat's fucked up.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nHe doesn't have to do that.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:48.000\nI would say I watched roots last night.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:52.000\nAnd then to come back a week later to fix your sink and be like,\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:55.000\nyou shit didn't stink that bad.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:58.000\nI just had had some work done.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:03.000\nAnd that one place, maybe I'd be like, well, that's a pretty honest plumber.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:06.000\nLike you didn't have to, you could have, because all shit stinks.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nI'd be like, okay, that's cool.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:12.000\nHe's been punching everything, but the therapy then,\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nthat's where the metaphor breaks down.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:15.000\nDid you keep her?\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.000\nNo.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:17.000\nOh good.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.000\nOkay.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:23.000\nNo, nor did I, like, you know, say, I'm firing you because, like,\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nI just didn't show up.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:29.000\nThat's what I do with all my therapists is like, I'm just didn't know I can show up.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:32.000\nHow's your current therapist's relationship going right now?\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nFantastic.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:34.000\nYeah.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:35.000\nSo good.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:36.000\nYou guys get along?\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nI mean, get along? No, fuck that.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nShe's just fucking good.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nDid Rocky get along with Burgess Meredith?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:43.000\nYes.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:45.000\nNo, he made him chase a chicken.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nThat's not what a friend does.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:50.000\nHe told him he was going to eat lightning and shit thunder.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:53.000\nYeah, but he told him that from out of a moving car\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nthat he was making him chase.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nLike, it's not a friendship.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nIt's more valuable than that.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:01.000\nYou're going to do great, kid.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:03.000\nCome on, you're a bum. I'm not a bum.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:06.000\nFriendship is for pussies.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:09.000\nHas your therapist ever told you that you might get murdered to death?\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nNo.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nBy Mr. T.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nThat's Rocky, too.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:20.000\nNo, but my therapist told me I have a 50% chance of suicide given my...\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:24.000\nRight, and tonight you said you weren't going to learn how to be happy,\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nwhich was the other alternative, right?\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nWait, no. Did I say that? I didn't say that.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nI thought you said you weren't going to find out how to be happy.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nWho says that? That's crazy.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nSo that's why I clocked it.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:38.000\nI was like, write this down and don't, like, follow up on this.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:42.000\nYeah, I don't... I mean, I didn't mean to say...\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nGood, because don't die.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:47.000\nWe don't give Spencer that fancy of desks to not remember things.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nRight.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:53.000\nAsk yourself if I've ever done anything cool\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:56.000\nand before you worry if I'm just going to kill myself without any...\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nYou're not going to kill yourself.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nNo, I'm not worried about that.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:03.000\nThat isn't cool. What I mean is, have I ever done anything restrained\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:06.000\nor, like, you know, like, I don't know what I'm going to do next week?\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.000\nI'm going to kill myself.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:11.000\nLike, I'm not capable of that level of...\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:14.000\nYou're not going to kill yourself. You're going to get killed by the alt-right.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:16.000\nAnd we all know that.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nSpencer's desk is backwards.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nYeah, it's this...\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:26.000\nWe've discussed this.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:29.000\nTell me, because this looks like a backwards desk.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:32.000\nYeah, but that's the whole point, right?\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nWell, think of it this way.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:38.000\nWhat do you think is behind, like, on the back of this desk?\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nDrawers.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nWell, what do you think is on the front?\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nFake drawers.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:45.000\nNo, he's saying...\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:48.000\nYou think there's drawers on both sides?\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:51.000\nNo, I think there's real drawers in the back where you are.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:53.000\nI think there's fake drawers on the front.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nWell, that's where you're...\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nWell, that's where you're wrong.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nOh, shit!\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nWait, what? Why is there...\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nNow get ready to have your mind really blown.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:03.000\nOh, shit.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:06.000\nJeff, I think there's fake drawers on the back.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nWhat?\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nThis is just like...\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:17.000\nOh, man, this is just like the Neil Patrick Harris Oscars or whatever.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nDo you guys remember that?\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:22.000\nAnd everyone's like, how did they know when they pre-planned the whole show\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:24.000\nwhat would happen on the show?\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nThis could never happen.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:30.000\nHow could all these actors do pre-scripted things?\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:33.000\nOn camera.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nThis is magic.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:38.000\nAnd I was like, why is anyone impressed?\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:41.000\nAnd people are like, what the fuck are you talking about?\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:44.000\nAnd I was like, you don't see what's happening?\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nActing.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:58.000\nOkay, that's been building for years.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:02.000\nI'm just so glad that you said it inside this time.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:05.000\nNot out in the street like the first time.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nNo, I know.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:11.000\nHe closed his own drawers.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:15.000\nI like our audience because what they applied is the confessional\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nthat's been building for years.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:22.000\nA lesser podcast, they've just been plotting after the rant about the thing.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:25.000\nBut then they liked that and then they waited and he said,\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:29.000\nthat's been building for years and they said, they love you.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:30.000\nI like them.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:33.000\nWell, okay, and they don't like being praised, fuck you.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nI like that too.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:39.000\nMaybe this is a bad thing to back-control on.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:44.000\nWe haven't brought up an audience member out of the audience on stage in a long time.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:48.000\nSomeone gasped at that.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:51.000\nProbably the worst guest we could ever...\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nDon't you think?\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:56.000\nBecause don't you think it's usually good if somebody's like,\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:59.000\noh, my dad died and I did this, but somebody that's like,\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:02.000\nI was just saying.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nThere's a good chance that person is...\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nIs it Adam Goldberg?\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:07.000\nNo.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nNo, no, it didn't mean that.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:10.000\nBut don't you...\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nWhat about Schrab?\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nWhat about Schrab?\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nOh, shit.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:19.000\nRob Schrab!\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:20.000\nWatch it once.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:21.000\nRob Schrab.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.000\nRob Schrab.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:23.000\nOh, shit.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:24.000\nRob Schrab.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:25.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:26.000\nRob Schrab.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:27.000\nRob Schrab.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:28.000\nRob Schrab.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:29.000\nRob Schrab.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nRob Schrab.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nRob Schrab.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:34.000\nWhat if Schrab was one of us?\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:37.000\nThat's an obligated visual dip.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:40.000\nHard to describe.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nSteve Levy in Two Doors.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:46.000\nReally, really taking me to task earlier.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:50.000\nI might have deconstructed you a little bit.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:55.000\nThat's all I do is just say things loud.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:56.000\nI didn't say that.\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:57.000\nI didn't say that.\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nDid you guys hear how strong my voice was just now\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:00.000\nwhen I saw Rob Schrab?\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:01.000\nI was so worried.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nI was like, you can't be doing this, man.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nNo, I'm allowed to have a strong voice\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:08.000\nuntil I feel like I'm tired.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:15.000\nI'm fucking back.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:18.000\nWell, Levy, can we...\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:21.000\nLevy, can we get Schrab a sarcastically comfortable\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:25.000\neasy chair for next week?\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nSo he can just be my dad.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:29.000\nThe journey can be complete.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:32.000\nWe should have just a bark-a-lounger out here for him.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:35.000\nCan we just then show you Mel Brooks movies\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:36.000\nthroughout my podcast?\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nAnd you can just go,\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:42.000\nNow that's funny.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:46.000\nI'll do that.\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:47.000\nI'll do that.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:49.000\nOh, look at this.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:50.000\nThank you.\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\nThat looks great.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.000\nSo let's compare.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:56.000\nIs this better or worse than the last chair?\n\n26:56.000 --> 27:01.000\nI'm going to say better.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:04.000\nBecause my feet are on the floor.\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:07.000\nAnd you're reaching for the stars.\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:12.000\nThis could be fun later on in the show.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.000\nThis little crack here.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:18.000\nLooks like it's half-built.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nI think my phone's going to go dead.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:23.000\nOh, no.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:24.000\nNow what?\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:25.000\nNow what?\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:26.000\nThe show.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:27.000\nBut with the show.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:28.000\nQuick hurry.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:33.000\nDo the show before it runs out.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nI'm going to do it now, don't I?\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nI just wanted to share that my dad\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nremembered the dad-fished episode.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.000\nI texted my dad during the show\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:42.000\nbecause everyone's like,\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:43.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:44.000\nHe did text back.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:46.000\nAnd I wanted to, what did he say?\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:49.000\nDo it in his voice.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:52.000\nNow, is this your actual dad that texted you?\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:53.000\nYes.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nBecause you didn't change Heath back, right?\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:58.000\nMonday, July 16th, 8.51 p.m.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\nI was here with you.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:02.000\nYou made me text my dad.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:04.000\nBecause apparently the following exchange\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:08.000\nwas standing between me and emotional fulfillment.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:11.000\nI said, my show got nominated for an Emmy exclamation point.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:14.000\nAnd Tuesday, July 17th, he texted back,\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.000\nFucking fantastic.\n\n28:16.000 --> 28:17.000\nYeah.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:18.000\nYeah.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:19.000\nYeah.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:20.000\nYeah.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:21.000\nYeah.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:22.000\nYeah.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:23.000\nYeah.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:24.000\nYeah.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:25.000\nYeah.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:26.000\nYou're healed.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:27.000\nYeah.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nDid he say, what else is new?\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:30.000\nNo.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:33.000\nWell, I mean, let's not put, you know, like, let's not,\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:36.000\nI like, he doesn't have to do more than that.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:37.000\nNo, no.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:38.000\nNo.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:39.000\nYou know.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:40.000\nMy parents don't pick up.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:42.000\nDid you have more of a conversation after that?\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:43.000\nLike, did you guys?\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:44.000\nNo.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:47.000\nWell, because, you know, I put out a little,\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nEmmy, fantastic.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nAnd you, what am I supposed to be like?\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:52.000\nHow's the garden?\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:53.000\nYeah.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:56.000\nWhy not use that as a way to open up a little dialogue\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:57.000\nbetween you and your son?\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nIt's only if you want the conversation to continue.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:00.000\nYeah.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:01.000\nI don't care about gardens.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:02.000\nNot Emmy worthy.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nBut what about?\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:05.000\nOkay.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:08.000\nNo, I thought that would get a laugh.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.000\nWhat?\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nYour dad opened up a dialogue.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nHe didn't open up a dialogue.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:14.000\nI

you?\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:05.000\nThat is a bull shit.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:06.000\nDon't applaud that.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nYou're, you're a flat.\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:09.000\nWell, okay.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nWe'll talk.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:16.000\nYour father who is as emotionally estranged as you are.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:17.000\nEmotionally estranged.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:18.000\nYeah.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:24.000\nWell, you, you can hold his hand if you want.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:25.000\nHe was mocking you.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nYou said problem.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nEarlier.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:31.000\nWhen there are two, my role changes.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:32.000\nHe speaketh.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:35.000\nI cosineeth.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:40.000\nBut your dad, your dad said hip hip hooray and you said nothing back.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nThat's, that's the end of that.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:43.000\nNo.\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:46.000\nWell, his dad, a normal dad would say hip hip hooray.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:47.000\nRight.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:53.000\nBut a, but a cool ponytail dad said, fucking fantastic.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nRead a cool thing.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:56.000\nYeah.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:57.000\nAnd so what?\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:58.000\nIt's really surprising.\n\n30:58.000 --> 31:02.000\nHow are we trying to spin this into me continuing to be with the old roof withholding guy?\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:03.000\nIt's playing catch.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:04.000\nIt's not going to work.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nIt's playing catch with words, Dan.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:07.000\nIt's what you've always wanted.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:08.000\nAll right.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:09.000\nOkay.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:10.000\nAll right.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:11.000\nAll right.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:12.000\nI'll, I'll, I'll, I'll.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:13.000\nHow about this?\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:14.000\nWell, every night of the week, I'll fucking text my dad.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:15.000\nOh, wow.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:16.000\nYeah.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:17.000\nText him right now.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:21.000\nTell him to see, tell him to see Mission Impossible fallout.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:22.000\nIt's supposed to be great.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:23.000\nYeah.\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:24.000\nTell him to see fallout.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:25.000\nIt's supposed to be great.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:30.000\nHave you seen Mission Impossible?\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:36.000\nNow, where does the colon go in a title like that?\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:37.000\nMission colon impossible.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:38.000\nAm I right?\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:39.000\nI think.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:40.000\nYeah, you're right.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:41.000\nYeah.\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:42.000\nMission colon impossible.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:43.000\nOh no, no, no.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nMission impossible colon fallout.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nMission, the mission is impossible.\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nIt's clearly mission colon impossible.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:52.000\nThe colon is baked into the original title.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:53.000\nOkay.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:54.000\nAll right.\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nJust tell your father you love him, Dan.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:59.000\nTell your father you love him, Dan.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:05.000\nTell him.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:10.000\nI prefer to go with a more possible mission.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:15.000\nHave you seen Mission colon impossible colon fallout?\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:16.000\nThis is.\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:19.000\nPeach with ghost protocol.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:20.000\nAs far as I'm concerned.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nIt's supposed to be, it's supposed to be really good.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:23.000\nI haven't seen it.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nWell, he's going to ask why I'm asking.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:29.000\nAnd the answer is because it's nice to hear from you, Dad.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:30.000\nI appreciate the.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:31.000\nOh, you can tell.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:32.000\nIs that what you want me to text?\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:33.000\nThe connection.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:34.000\nIt's nice to hear from you, Dad.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:35.000\nI appreciate the connection.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:36.000\nWait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:40.000\nCan we, now that you have given him some information about yourself,\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\ncan we maybe ask about him?\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:43.000\nAsk him a question.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:44.000\nThank you, Brandon.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:45.000\nWhat should I ask him?\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:46.000\nYou should ask him if you've seen.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:47.000\nHow's your.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nHave you seen mission?\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:50.000\nDid you hear?\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:51.000\nYou should say.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:54.000\nDid you hear about these nuts in this Emmy nomination?\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nOh, no, I already come on.\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:57.000\nYou're trying to trick me.\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:58.000\nNo, no, no, really.\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:01.000\nMaybe you should say, maybe you should ask him what he's been up to.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nWhat have you been up to?\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:07.000\nI miss you, father.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nWhat?\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:12.000\nWhat have you been up to?\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:16.000\nQuestion mark, and that ends that segment.\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:22.000\nEveryone backseat drives my fucking relationship with my father.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:26.000\nIn spite of me giving you complete fucking control over it,\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:32.000\nyou will never learn the lesson that the road leads nowhere.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:33.000\nI think it's fun.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:34.000\nDrive it off a cliff.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:35.000\nI don't fucking care.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:36.000\nThelma and Louise, my life.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:38.000\nHe pieces of shit.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:41.000\nMaybe love grows on trees where you live.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:42.000\nDon't fucking bully me.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:43.000\nAll right.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:44.000\nAll right.\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:45.000\nEverybody's a piece of shit.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:48.000\nI can turn off my fucking feelings like a light.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:49.000\nOh, God.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:50.000\nNo, Collins.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:54.000\nI don't think two women driving a car off a cliff to commit suicide.\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:55.000\nIt's exactly the same.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nIt's the same as saying, hi, dad.\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nIt is exactly the same.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:00.000\nIt's not the same.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:04.000\nDon't you ever try to take that away from me or my gender?\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:05.000\nDon't do it.\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:10.000\nHere's something I haven't ever seen long his good night.\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\nAnd I just watched it recently.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:13.000\nPretty good.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:23.000\nLet's do a scene from it.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:26.000\nThe long kiss good night.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nHey, what are you doing?\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nHey, what are you doing?\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:33.000\nHey, hey, hey, how'd you get it?\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nHey, what are you doing?\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:36.000\nOh, God.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:37.000\nOh, God.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:38.000\nOh, God.\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nOh, God.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:45.000\nIt flies backwards.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:48.000\nAnd out of the story.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nThat was a long kiss.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:54.000\nGood night.\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nI have to rewatch that movie.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:57.000\nIt's pretty good.\n\n34:57.000 --> 35:00.000\nI think it might be Dutch.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:08.000\nI don't remember that much Nospiratu in it.\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:11.000\nHave you seen the Franklin Jell-O Dracula?\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:12.000\nNot for a long time.\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:14.000\nLet's see a scene from that one.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:22.000\nLet's see a scene from Franklin Jell-O Dracula.\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:28.000\nOh, a wolf man.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nBut you have to mention the camera.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:35.000\n20% of the movie is a camera facing down the side of a building\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:38.000\nwith Franklin Jell-O moving his hands,\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:41.000\ngreen screaming up the side of a building.\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nHe's either coming for Renford,\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nhe's coming for Lucy,\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nhe's coming for Free Pretzels,\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:48.000\nhe'll Spider-Man.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nThat movie should have been called Spider-Man.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\nRenford.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\nRenford?\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.000\nWhat's his name?\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:58.000\nBam, bam, bam, bam, bam.\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:01.000\nBAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:08.000\nOh shit, hey, hey, what are you doing up there, what are you doing?\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.000\nSanford, you will obey me.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.000\nNo, no, I'm Renford.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:15.000\nOh, oh, I'm going, I'm going.\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nYou have no faith Sanford.\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nI'm going, I'm going, I'm going.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nYou eat that cockroach.\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:24.000\nI'm eating that cockroach.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:29.000\nI expected you to be harder to command.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nYou are known for your fortitude.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:35.000\nThat's some lazy improv, I just kind of go, eh, fuck it.\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nThat was Renford and son.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nRenford.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:44.000\nYou like that, that Trob Nile, just like, uh, Sanford.\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:48.000\nNo, I was trying to let them know there was a guy named Sanford once,\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:51.000\nand you're like, oh, more like Renford, like, yeah, well, we,\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:54.000\nwhat do you think the name is of the Dracula's thrall?\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nRenfield?\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nOh, shit.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:02.000\nBut you know what, dumb name.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nRenford.\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nIf I had a thrall.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:08.000\nRenford, the big red dog.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:12.000\nWas, was, was Renfield a vampire or what?\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:13.000\nWhy is the-\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.000\nHe wanted to become a vampire.\n\n37:15.000

it.\n\n01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:36.940\nYeah, that's fine.\n\n01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:38.940\nDon't have to do it for you, don't have to do it for anybody.\n\n01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:39.940\nNo.\n\n01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:40.940\nJust say anything on the bottom of it.\n\n01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:42.940\nSir, you don't have to do anything.\n\n01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:43.940\nYou don't have to do anything.\n\n01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:44.940\nThat's right, motherfucker.\n\n01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:45.940\nGlad you got here.\n\n01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:47.940\nWhy don't you come here by stroller?\n\n01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:54.940\nThat's enough apple juice.\n\n01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:56.940\nGive me a beat.\n\n01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:57.940\nDon't give me a beat.\n\n01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.940\nYou know, at a certain point, he's going to leave.\n\n01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:00.940\nEveryone's going to leave.\n\n01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:02.940\nIt's going to be me and you.\n\n01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:03.940\nYou know what?\n\n01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:04.940\nI'm going to remember who fucking backed me up.\n\n01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:06.940\nI'm going to be a fucking pianist.\n\n01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:07.940\nI'm going to write a concerto.\n\n01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:08.940\nIt's going to tear you to pieces.\n\n01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:11.940\nYou're going to kill yourself.\n\n01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:13.940\nI don't even need lyrics.\n\n01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:15.940\nYou're going to tell C-Sharp, that's about me.\n\n01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:20.940\nCush.\n\n01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:21.940\nThat's how good I'm going to be,\n\n01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:23.940\nand that's how fucked up you are.\n\n01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:27.940\nAre you still here?\n\n01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:30.940\nThis whole thing's being recorded right now.\n\n01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:36.940\nIt's all being baby monitored, too.\n\n01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:39.940\nI was born recorded.\n\n01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:41.940\nI'm part of the fucking new generation, bitch.\n\n01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:44.940\nI got no conscience.\n\n01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:46.940\nThat fucking rapture happened a long time ago.\n\n01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:47.940\nI was born without a soul.\n\n01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:48.940\nJust say you pooped in the tree.\n\n01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:50.940\nJust

up.\n\n01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:04.940\nWhat baby?\n\n01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:05.940\nYou got a baby cam in the front yard?\n\n01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.940\nYou got them all over the place.\n\n01:34:07.940 --> 01:34:08.940\nYou fucking prick.\n\n01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:09.940\nYou fucked us.\n\n01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:10.940\nYou fucked us.\n\n01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:11.940\nWe're

me.\n\n01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:36.940\nI'd like to talk.\n\n01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:37.940\nI got it.\n\n01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:38.940\nAll right.\n\n01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:39.940\nYou wanna wrap it up?\n\n01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:40.940\nWhat?\n\n01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:41.940\nYou wanna wrap it?\n\n01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:43.940\nNo, don't.\n\n01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:47.940\nEven as a baby, I know that's not the way to end.\n\n01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:48.940\nThat's not...\n\n01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:50.940\nYou can sing it out.\n\n01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.940\nNo, I sing as like a gangster term for talk.\n\n01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:53.940\nOkay.\n\n01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:55.940\nI didn't mean I'm gonna sing a song.\n\n01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:57.940\nI know what you meant.\n\n01:34:57.940 --> 01:34:58.940\nI know what you meant.\n\n01:34:58.940 --> 01:34:59.940\nOh, God.\n\n01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:01.940\nAll right, we won't look at it.\n\n01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:02.940\nWe won't look at the police.\n\n01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:03.940\nYeah, don't look at my shit.\n\n01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:05.940\nWe'll just have the police move in.\n\n01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:08.940\nWhy don't you just sit down and move in?\n\n01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.940\nI never gonna go.\n\n01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:11.940\nWhat do you think being born is?\n\n01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:12.940\nIt's me moving in.\n\n01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:13.940\nGive me a fucking break, man.\n\n01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:15.940\nI shit on your tree, okay?\n\n01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:16.940\nYou cut it down.\n\n01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:17.940\nHow do you get the tree feels?\n\n01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:18.940\nWhoa, whoa.\n\n01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:19.940\nWe just got it.\n\n01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:20.940\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:21.940\nI confess.\n\n01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:22.940\nWe got it.\n\n01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:23.940\nWe got a confession.\n\n01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:24.940\nYou got that baby to tell the truth?\n\n01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:25.940\nDon't you lie to me, David?\n\n01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:26.940\nI got departments, more departments, and a grocery store.\n\n01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:27.940\nNo, we have...\n\n01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:28.940\nThey're yelling at me.\n\n01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:29.940\nWe have it on baby cancer.\n\n01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:30.940\nWe have it on baby cancer.\n\n01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:31.940\nBring them into the station and make them confess.\n\n01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:32.940\nWe got a confession.\n\n01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:33.940\nYou got that baby to tell the truth?\n\n01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:34.940\nDon't you lie to me, David?\n\n01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:35.940\nI got departments, more departments, and a grocery store.\n\n01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:40.940\nThey're yelling at me.\n\n01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:40.940\nWe have it on baby cancer.\n\n01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:40.940\nBring them into the station and make them confess to me.\n\n01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:43.940\nOr it's your ass, David.\n\n01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:44.940\nYou're boss.\n\n01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:45.940\nMr. Levy, I hate to...\n\n01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:46.940\nI know you're only two years old.\n\n01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:47.940\nI understand.\n\n01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:48.940\nI can over here.\n\n01:35:48.940 --> 01:36:00.940\nWe're in a scene about a baby pooping criminal, and this police commissioner is still in\n\n01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:01.940\nthe show.\n\n01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:10.940\nI want to know more about him, and I'm the baby.\n\n01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:16.940\nWe could probably take two years off your sentence if you go and confess to him.\n\n01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:18.940\nDo you know what they say about babies?\n\n01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.940\nTwo years is a life sentence.\n\n01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:21.940\nYeah.\n\n01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:25.940\nDissolve to police commissioner's office.\n\n01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:29.940\nAre these real Skittles?\n\n01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:31.940\nI think they're breath mints.\n\n01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:34.940\nYou can touch anything you want from here.\n\n01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:35.940\nWand around.\n\n01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:41.940\nBut why did you shit on the tree?\n\n01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:42.940\nWhy?\n\n01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:47.940\nSuch an easy question for you, isn't it?\n\n01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:50.940\nSee from your placard on the wall, you went to what?\n\n01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:51.940\nWest Point?\n\n01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:52.940\nI did.\n\n01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:56.940\nI suppose all the furniture was where you could hold it.\n\n01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:57.940\nWell, you waddled.\n\n01:36:57.940 --> 01:36:59.940\nI walk.\n\n01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:03.940\nDo you remember there was a time when you couldn't?\n\n01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:05.940\nOf course I do.\n\n01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:09.940\nI had to ask people for things.\n\n01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:13.940\nAccountability is why I yell at David so much.\n\n01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:15.940\nCan I smoke?\n\n01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:17.940\nOf course.\n\n01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:21.940\nI think we both should.\n\n01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:26.940\nCommissioner, you and I both have a world of fucking problem here.\n\n01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:28.940\nMy diaper is a literal one.\n\n01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:30.940\nYours is the city.\n\n01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:32.940\nThey're both full of shit.\n\n01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:34.940\nThey both need to change.\n\n01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:37.940\nYou change me without changing yours.\n\n01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:41.940\nYou can have a lot of shit on your hands.\n\n01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:44.940\nAnd I'll admit, I'm in no position to stick to my guns.\n\n01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:46.940\nCan't pick a gun up.\n\n01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:48.940\nWays as much as I do.\n\n01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:54.940\nI wish I could change that, but laws.\n\n01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:56.940\nBut I have an idea.\n\n01:37:56.940 --> 01:38:02.940\nTwo days later, at the Statue of Liberty...\n\n01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:19.940\nA lot of babies go through the academy.\n\n01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:21.940\nBut most of them don't make it.\n\n01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:22.940\nMake it.\n\n01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:28.940\nMake it.\n\n01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.940\nIt's just that a baby becomes a cop.\n\n01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:37.940\nAnd that's how you become a cop, is that the Statue of Liberty?\n\n01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:40.940\nDon't touch it.\n\n01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:41.940\nSeal it up.\n\n01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:42.940\nThat's exactly how it happened.\n\n01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:45.940\nVerbado.\n\n01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:48.940\nI love it when you become a cop no matter where you live,\n\n01:38:48.940 --> 01:39:05.300\nthe statue of liberty? What's our job? To protect the statue or just liberty? I mean, look, I've\n\n01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:09.820\nnever seen Family Guy, isn't that just their bit? What, the baby can talk, right? And he's just like,\n\n01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:13.500\noh, I'm a baby. Yeah, who cares? I thought that's what you were doing. Yeah, well, I don't know.\n\n01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:21.700\nAsk my therapist. I don't watch fucking Family Guy. Shots fired, fired, fired. Shots fired to my\n\n01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:26.580\ntherapist. I'm like, watch the fucking show. God damn it, I've given you, look, would you just watch\n\n01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:32.500\nRick and Morty? Jesus Christ, fucking therapist. She's just doing it because she knows, we've been\n\n01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:37.340\nover this. Why does she not watch the show? I'm like, Jesus Christ, I'm having such a towel,\n\n01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:41.100\nI gotta weigh this and then that. And I'm trying to think of, oh, wait a minute. And she's like,\n\n01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:45.060\nyou know, Peter Griffin has the thing in his, I'm like, who the fuck are you talking about? What\n\n01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:51.220\nthe fuck are you talking about? What are you talking about? Peter Griffin. I want to know,\n\n01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:56.500\nwhat was, I want to know what her example was. She has some example, like he had an angel and a\n\n01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:59.660\ndevil. I'm like, that's the one reference you don't even have to make. But I don't want to make\n\n01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:07.140\nher sound like a bad therapist. She just doesn't understand television. She understands the human\n\n01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:11.900\nbrain. You know, but then she's like TV. She's like, you know, it's funny. It reminds me of this\n\n01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:22.460\nthing. There was this land of the lost. I'm like, bitch, update your Netflix. It's not how Netflix\n\n01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:27.980\nworks. You don't update it. And then the show's getting newer. It's not how it works. Land of the\n\n01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:39.300\nlost update girls, girls. The sleep stacks turn into millennial women finding themselves in New\n\n01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:47.220\nYork. All right, you know, look, if it's that hard to steal focus, it means the show's going well.\n\n01:40:47.220 --> 01:41:04.060\nThe soup's almost done. Rob's right. All soup is inevitably almost done. I set you up and you\n\n01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:07.380\nwere fucking let's end the show. I guess just reminding you this one thing like there's this\n\n01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:13.500\npodcast called the no sleep podcast. But it's like it's been on for like 1112 seasons. Like I'm\n\n01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:18.260\nobsessed with like creepy pasta like podcasts. I was listening to this thing called creepy. But\n\n01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:23.500\nthen I realized that he keeps referencing but it's for some reason Canadians are like, like as a\n\n01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:28.260\nnationality like Canadians like are the ones that are really into creepy pasta like it's sort of\n\n01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:33.740\nlike like the Irish are into bootlegging in the 20s. Like it's like the Canadian will look back\n\n01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:38.620\nwhen they're the creepy pasta phenomenon of course was being trafficked into podcasting by the\n\n01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:46.540\nCanadians for some reason. And it's so funny like when people are I just it's so hard to scare me\n\n01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:54.420\nwhen you say a boot like it's so funny. You can't fucking do it. It's like, oh, and then I looked\n\n01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:59.980\nin the monkey paw was a ruined the thing. And it's just like it's so adorable. It's a Canadian.\n\n01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:06.580\nWhat's creepy? What's creepy pasta? It's just I think that's just shorthand for like ghost stories\n\n01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:12.580\nthat the the in the incarnation of like forum posts and stuff where you are sometimes the line\n\n01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:17.140\nbetween reality is blurred as they always were with with campfire stories but now in the digital age\n\n01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:25.740\ncreepy pasta. I think it comes from copy paste. So like copy pasta which is a copied and pasted text\n\n01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:35.020\nblock. I think the earmark of a good one. Just information. Why would you what why would you do\n\n01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:39.820\nthat? Why would you do no one would do anything? It just evolved. There's just kids like telling each\n\n01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:44.100\nother ghost stories online. You know, same thing as a campfire, but they don't have campfires anymore\n\n01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:52.140\nbecause the world is on fire. Did they have to do with food? No, because I don't know it just\n\n01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:56.700\nderives language fucking thrives. It just fucking turns into other shit. Language just lives a\n\n01:42:56.700 --> 01:43:05.100\ncreepy text block that's been copied and pasted. Creepy pasta. But I will say this. The one I listen\n\n01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:14.700\nto creepy. There's a guy who goes, this is creepy. The biggest collection of the most. Can I just\n\n01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:20.300\npull it up and pull it up because because the thing is the way that the guy says the word pasta in\n\n01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:25.740\ncreepy pasta. It's like there's something like he can't escape like he's he's and when I say old\n\n01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:31.980\nman is my age, but I'm just saying like he's so old that he like he can't say that phrase creepy\n\n01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:40.700\npasta without really making it sound delicious. Where he's like, I never like I just want to I\n\n01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:45.980\ndid I like live just indulge me and because I'm in a good mood and thank you. Thank you all for\n\n01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:56.940\nanother week of you know in one of these days I may have something really specific to thank you\n\n01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:01.180\nguys for like over the weeks and things there may be certain battles that have to be fought in\n\n01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:05.740\nsilence and things and I really owe you guys a fucking lot and we'll talk about it on the other\n\n01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:16.940\nside of of a tunnel that's going to be worth it. But I try to play the the intro of let's hear how\n\n01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:22.460\ndelicious this pasta is. I'm afraid my battery is going to go out but that'll be just cool. All right\n\n01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:28.700\nyou know what Schrab? You're just a little bit too batteryy. Didn't you get an expensive one?\n\n01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:33.500\nWhat are they going to make? Didn't you get an expensive power? People that just the podcast\n\n01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:40.380\napp is so bad and it's fun to watch you go through that live. It's so it's really bad. I just want\n\n01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:45.260\nto also I wrote one for the if you're a patreon subscriber that he'll do one that I and I wrote\n\n01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:53.420\none and did he read it? Well he recorded it. Oh cool. Levy can we have a second phone on this?\n\n01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:58.780\nYeah. Spencer's got his phone now. I just set it down though. The only reason is this point.\n\n01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:06.620\nI was going to help but I was like nah. Well because you knew it was going to be hard. Well I just\n\n01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:12.940\nthought that you were most of the way there but. I think you know I think it's largely like. Oh\n\n01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:16.140\nyou have bad signal in here huh? My phone's at five percent and there's no signal and it's\n\n01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:21.980\nten o'clock. Well it's just let's. We'll see you for next time. Oh yeah. Sorry if I come back now.\n\n01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:28.060\nI have a lot to talk about with creepy pasta podcasts. It's been my new thing.\n\n01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:31.900\nWhy don't Dan why don't you just cast one spell in D&D right now? Like just like\n\n01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:39.580\nlet's just say that we're in the middle of a thing and you cast one spell. Do I have any spells left?\n\n01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:48.540\nNo. Well let's say that Dan had rested in here and he has one. No let's say Dan rested. That's\n\n01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:56.700\nfucked up. I'm sick of this resting. You have spell slots. You need to rest. All right. Eight\n\n01:45:56.700 --> 01:46:04.540\nhours. Who has a spell among us right now? No one. Well you all have. You don't fucking DM from\n\n01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:13.180\nthe bottom. The PM. You don't DM from the PM. You don't DM from the PM. I'm top of the bottom right\n\n01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:22.620\nnow. You don't. Well then Dan use a weapon. Like do it do it. I use my cudgel. Oh it's great.\n\n01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:27.340\nYeah. That'll make sense without context. There you go. You hit him right in the dick.\n\n01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:34.140\nWe're all so lucky I didn't drive here tonight. Yeah man.
