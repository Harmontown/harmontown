We're in Back to the Future's version of the future.\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:37.000\nAre we all wearing metal hats and things like that?\n\n00:37.000 --> 00:39.000\nYeah, we've got little LEDs.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:45.000\nYou have to choose whether you're a lobo, a squeam squab, or a zip-head.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:47.000\nWhat's the...\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:50.000\nYou're a tranq, a lobo.\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:53.000\nWait, do you actually know what's the...\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:58.000\nLowres, Bojo, and Flapjack? What are the three?\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:01.000\nThat's Back to the Future 2, anyway.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:05.000\nYouTube recommend...\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:09.000\nI recommend YouTube. It's amazing.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:13.000\nIt's videos just direct to your computer.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:19.000\nThe next time you're like, oh boy, I got nothing to do.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:26.000\nI got nothing to think about. My world isn't dark enough.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:29.000\nThis will actually lighten it up.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:33.000\nThere's these videos. Schrab sent me.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:39.000\nThere's this guy. This is my new fascination is the people who are exposing things,\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:43.000\nlike the Illuminati things, the patterns that they see in stuff.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:46.000\nYou've seen the one that's like Angels in the Outfield.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:50.000\nThere's a guy who's proving that Angels in the Outfield is like a pedophile.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:54.000\nIt's like a pedophile spell that it's casting on you.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:56.000\nAnd it just keeps like freeze, right?\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:02.000\nHe's going, look where his eyes are looking, right at the little boy's dick.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:05.000\nThe Back to the Future one is like fucking amazing.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:07.000\nThere's this guy who's just like...\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:10.000\nAnd he throws everything at it.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:23.000\nFirst of all, he sees every moon landing JFK and 9-11 in Back to the Future.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:27.000\nLike he literally says at one point in his video,\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:34.000\nthe movie is crawling with 9-11s as he's pointing them out.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:44.000\nThere is a point, for example, when the DeLorean finally goes back to the future and leaves the trail of 11,\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:47.000\nas it heads for the movie theater, and the camera pans back,\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:52.000\nand there is a fucking god damn if there isn't a god damn 9.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:57.000\nIt's like some kind of Western themed breakfast place or something with a lasso for a logo,\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:59.000\nand it's like 9-11.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:03.000\nI'm a convert, but...\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:12.000\nThe crazy thing about it is that the guy can detect every 9-11 if he sees JFK's head everywhere.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:17.000\nBut he doesn't know that there's a difference between Back to the Future one and two.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:19.000\nHe keeps referring to him as the same movie.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:21.000\nIt's like, no, that's the second one.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nYou're in the splash zone here, my friend.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:25.000\nYou're going to get a little bit of...\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:27.000\nWhat happens is the vodka has a...\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:30.000\nMy mustache has a wick effect.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:34.000\nAnd I take a drink of the vodka capillaries up.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:38.000\nAnd so then whenever I have a splosive...\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:39.000\nA splosive?\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:46.000\nThe other day, I picked a pack of peppers.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:50.000\nIt's just vodka. It's not even spit. It's just pure vodka.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:51.000\nIt's good for you.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:54.000\nSo if you sit in the right place, you can get fucked up?\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nYeah, yeah. Especially him.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:59.000\nLook at him. He's a pretty fresh-faced young man.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:04.000\nI believe you could get drunk off of a little bit of aerosol vodka.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:11.000\nThat's a compliment. You're a very handsome little boy.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:17.000\nIf you want to watch Angels in the Outfield later...\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:23.000\nDan, is it me or is your beard achieving greatness?\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:27.000\nI can actually... I noticed backstage that I can actually grab it with my fist now.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nThere's a thing here I can grab.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nA threshold has been crossed with your beard.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:34.000\nI lost my trimmer at the wedding.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:37.000\nIt's somewhere in the house. I had my beard trimmer.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:40.000\nI trimmed my beard for the wedding and I haven't trimmed it since.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nSo this is...\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:43.000\nSee, it looks trimmed, though.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:49.000\nIt looks like you've manicured a nice gentle-ben kind of beard.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nI haven't.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nAnyways, what...\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:55.000\nYouTube. We're talking about YouTube.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:59.000\nSo, yeah, just check that out.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:01.000\nJust Google YouTube...\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:03.000\nYahoo! Use Yahoo!\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:09.000\nBack to the future, 9-11.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:19.000\nThe JFK stuff is really interesting because the guy is convinced that the Hill Valley is identical to Dealey Plaza\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:24.000\nand that Marty McFly is standing where Kennedy was shot\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:28.000\nwhen he's looking at the Sports Almanac.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:35.000\nAnd in the window where you see the Sports Almanac, you see two different presidents portrayed two-dimensionally,\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:39.000\nbut then you can see a Kennedy head that is three-dimensional,\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:45.000\nthus proving the point which is that Kennedy is a transcendent, multi-dimensional being\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:48.000\nand his assassination has something to do with...\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nBack to the future.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nAnd 9-11.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.000\nHe's in it again.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:56.000\nAnd the guy keeps calling...\n\n05:56.000 --> 06:00.000\nOf course, he's Gaga for the Twin Pines thing.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:03.000\nOf course, he's crazy about the Twin Pines thing.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:06.000\nHe's like, for some reason, now there's one pine.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nMotherfucker, watch the movie that you're...\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nIt's not a hidden message.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nIt's the joke is that the...\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:18.000\nIt's like, why is there now one pine?\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nIt's a bit.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nThat's pine 11.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nThat's been our show. Thanks, guys.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nThanks for coming.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:36.000\nI think it's the biggest...\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nThat wasn't even funny.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:41.000\nYou guys are a real pushover.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nYeah, they're a hot crowd.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nWe got to reward them.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nGot to reward them for this heat.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:50.000\nGot to make some popcorn with this.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nSo, this is the last week, I think,\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:01.000\nthat the music is going to be just a free-for-all, copyright-wise.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:04.000\nShould I just play Beatles all night, then?\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nBut we're asking...\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:11.000\nIf you go to Harmontownmusic.tumblr.com,\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:13.000\nif you're a musician anywhere in the world, really,\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.000\nthere's already people that are giving us stuff\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:19.000\nthat we can use under a term that they can agree to.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:22.000\nWe'll use people's stuff who let us use their music\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.000\nand we'll be able to give you credit stuff.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nThat'll be fun, because I love being able to play whatever I want.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nBut I would love to...\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:32.000\nIf it was all Armenian music, that'd be very cool.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nYeah, yeah. Well, it'd be cool, because, yeah,\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:37.000\nthey do a little thing, especially like...\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:41.000\nStir me up a little hip-hop pudding.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:46.000\nYou little hip-hoppers out there\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:48.000\nwithin the sound of my voice, you know,\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nyou could be really...\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nI'm sure that would be a real honor\n\n07:55.000 --> 08:00.000\nfor your beats to be served up alongside my dropped science.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:06.000\nOkay, so SimCity Build It is going on in the news.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:10.000\nI'm playing it on my iPad,\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:13.000\nand you know how those Sims...\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nYou know how the Sims, like, they talk gibberish,\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nlike SimLanguage, they go, like,\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nR-R-R-B-R, you know?\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:24.000\nThere's a guy, every time you click on a guy\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nthat's going to sell you something\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nor buy something from you,\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nhe goes, he goes,\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:36.000\nPussy whips.

hard name to rhyme.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:26.000\nSelfie sticks.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:29.000\nAre happening in the news.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nYou got back from Paris.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nI was at the Eiffel Tower a couple weeks before you,\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nand everybody had their goddamn selfies.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:38.000\nSelfies be stickin'.\n\n10:38.000 -->

thing when you were in Paris\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nwhere the people walk up, do you speak English?\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:53.000\nThere were women that walk up to you, do you speak English?\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:56.000\nI don't talk to women.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.000\nThat's a hard line.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:01.000\nNo, it's just people, like panhandlers,\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:04.000\nbut the thing is, you look American, do you speak English?\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:09.000\nA previous trip to Paris, I think,\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:12.000\nI encountered somebody came up\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:15.000\nand thrust a note into my hands\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:19.000\nthat was this long, tragic tale of, like,\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nmy child is basically like a global,\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:25.000\nkind of born identity version of,\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nI ran out of gas, my kids are in the car,\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.000\nbut it was much more creepy,\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:34.000\nlike, why do I know where the exits are?\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.000\nWhere's my safety deposit box?\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.000\nI can't even remember how we responded to it.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:40.000\nYou said, yes, that's happened to you.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.000\nDo you remember what it is?\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.000\nWhat's in and out of it?\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:47.000\nThey didn't speak English very well themselves,\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:50.000\nso they kind of broke an English written down\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:53.000\nand it looked like a soft story.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:56.000\nYeah, and you just kind of have to give the note back.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:59.000\nHere's your note back.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nSo, selfie sticks.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nSelfie sticks are happening.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nDo you have one?\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:07.000\nI don't have a selfie stick.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nWhat's the point of a selfie stick?\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nIf you don't have a friend to hold your camera?\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nI don't know.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:17.000\nThe first selfie stick I saw was in Venice,\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nand I thought, oh, this must just be something,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nlike, maybe it's canal-based.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nMaybe there's too many canals here\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:27.000\nand maybe it's an adaptation, like a gondola, you know?\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:30.000\nLike, you can't take a good selfie.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.000\nToo many people lose their phones over the canal, maybe.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:37.000\nBut then it turned out, oh, no, I've just arrived in Europe\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nas the selfie stick has arrived on humanity.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nAre these people walking around by themselves\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:43.000\nwith the selfie stick, or are they with other people?\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:47.000\nI saw a couple, I was walking in Paris behind a couple,\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nnot even in, like, a touristy place,\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:53.000\nand I was behind a couple in an empty street\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nand they were walking and holding hands\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:58.000\nand the man let go of her hand,\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:01.000\ntook the selfie stick, extended it,\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:04.000\nand got, like, a tracking, like,\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:08.000\nlike, like, like, like, selfie stick shot of them walking\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\njust for a little bit, and then put it,\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nthey both, they kept their heads forward\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.000\nwhile he did it, he got the shot,\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:16.000\nand then reteles-\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nSo they're just, like, the, like, survivor man\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:20.000\nwalking down the road, like, just, like, filming themselves?\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:21.000\nI don't know, yeah, it's just, I guess it's just,\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nthey feel it's a better shot.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nIt's like a little jib for them?\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:26.000\nI don't like it.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:27.000\nYeah.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nI'm again it.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:31.000\nI did, was it worth it, Adam?\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:36.000\nAdam, if you had a selfie stick,\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:39.000\nwould that have been easier for you?\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:42.000\nI would, yeah, if everybody, next week,\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\neverybody brings selfie sticks and\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:46.000\nwe'll do something with them, I don't know.\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nIt worked for Ellen.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:50.000\nAll right.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nWould you get a selfie stick?\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nIf you had one, would you use it?\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.000\nIf I was able, would you, would you get a selfie stick?\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\nNo, I would not, I don't, I was, I was,\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nI was definitely, I had a lot of opportunities\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:02.000\nto get a selfie stick.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nIf somebody, if somebody gifted you one at work,\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:05.000\nwould you, would you, would you,\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nironically carry it around and then use it?\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nNo, I would use, I would use it to see\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:10.000\nwhat the hubbub's about.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:12.000\nIt just seems like a stick with your camera\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\non the end of it.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nYeah.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.000\nIt's stupid.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:16.000\nAsk a stranger, ask a stranger,\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nsay take a fucking picture of me.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:20.000\nYeah, well, I mean, maybe that's,\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:22.000\nI don't know, you don't know.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.000\n$800 pump.\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:26.000\nYeah, well, whatever he said, it's true, too.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nYou both have your points.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:29.000\nYour beard has got me mesmerized.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nYour beard is really good.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:34.000\nAlso, the gray is coming in nicely.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nYou now have a properly gray beard.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:38.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:44.000\nHe's, Liam Neeson is,\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nhe's,\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:49.000\nLiam Neeson is in Taken 3\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:52.000\nand he's, he, he,\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:55.000\nthere's a, somebody, somebody sent me a link\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:59.000\nto a LinkedIn like promotion where he's,\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:03.000\nhe sits him doing his character saying like,\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:06.000\noh, my name's Conor McJohnson,\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nwhatever his character's name is.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:11.000\nMe and my friends have a particular set of skills.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:16.000\nSkills like enhanced conversation.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:19.000\nAnd then they'll cut to like a clip from Taken\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nwhere they're like meeting people up.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:24.000\nAerodynamic persuasion\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:27.000\nand then throwing a guy out a window.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:30.000\nAnd then he goes on to say,\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nlike, do you have a particular set of skills?\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:35.000\nIf you send in your LinkedIn profile,\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:39.000\na lucky winner will have me read their resume\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nto their prospective employers explaining\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\ntheir particular set of skills.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nHe keeps saying particular set of skills.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nFor real?\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nYeah.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:48.000\nIt's pretty, it's pretty amazing.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:49.000\nWhy don't we try that?\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:50.000\nWhy don't we get, get on that?\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:51.000\nGo ahead.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:52.000\nYeah.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:53.000\nThat's what you're supposed to do.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:54.000\nDo it.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:57.000\nGet, get, get on LinkedIn and make a profile.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:58.000\nWhat is LinkedIn?\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:02.000\nIt's something that everyone outside LA uses.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:07.000\nI don't understand it at all.\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nIt's job Facebook.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:10.000\nIt's job Facebook.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nWhich is as exciting as it sounds.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:13.000\nIt's a resume.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:16.000\nIt's like a, it's like the internet equivalent of\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:20.000\nwhile someone's driving by you on a, on a, on a road,\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:26.000\nthrowing your resume through their back window.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:31.000\nSo that they have it.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:35.000\nExcept unless you're hiring a backseat person,\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nyou're going to find it and be annoyed.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:40.000\nYou're going to be like, who put this garbage in my car?\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:41.000\nOr my inbox?\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:46.000\nThe cool thing about it is that I'll see every once in a while,\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:49.000\nI'll get a LinkedIn profile, like a LinkedIn request from\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:53.000\nsomebody like, from like 12 years ago that was like a,\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nlike a bigger shot than me.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nAnd like now is like sending me their LinkedIn profile.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nThat's kind of cool.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:02.000\nIt's, it's, it's like seeing them like, like, like, you know,\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:09.000\nselling selfie sticks on a boardwalk or something LinkedIn.\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:13.000\nI'm sure it's, I'm sure LinkedIn is, is great for people that I just,\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nI don't understand.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:18.000\nYou know, so it helps you if maybe if you stain glass,\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:21.000\nbut you don't like to cut glass and you send your LinkedIn profile\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nout and there's some guy that's like, he only likes cutting glass,\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:29.000\nbut it doesn't know how to stain it.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nI think that's the idea.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:32.000\nDid you enjoy your honeymoon?\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:33.000\nWas it fun?\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nYeah.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:35.000\nBecause you guys run everywhere.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nYou guys were in Dublin and Paris and Venice.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nYeah.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nI figured out why I love Dublin and Ireland.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:46.000\nCause we went to like this Irish storytelling night.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nLike it was a very touristy thing.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:53.000\nLike in this, in this bar, it was like you get a dinner and this lady\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:56.000\nstood in front of a fireplace and told Irish stories and sang songs and stuff.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nAnd it was really cool.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:02.000\nAnd she explained Irish history and it kind of dawned on me like listening\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:05.000\nto the stuff, why I fetishize Irish cultures.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:09.000\nCause they're, they're a European culture without, they didn't have a renaissance.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:14.000\nThey don't, they don't have, they didn't participate in this rich people bullshit.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:17.000\nLike they're, they're, they're their own little, little thing.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:21.000\nLike they don't, if you go back in their history, any other like European culture,\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:25.000\nit's like, if you go to their museums or whatever, there's going to be some\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:29.000\nlike red suspenders at some point, like, or some like fancy pointy shoes\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:33.000\nor like a windmill hat or something like, like, oh, and then we did this.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nSo this is what we're famous for.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nHe could do it to do.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nLike, like, like, look at us.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:43.000\nLike we look like flower people are like, like, like, like we got, we got perfume on our,\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:46.000\non our, on our, on our, on our face.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:49.000\nWhat country is that?\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nThe one I just described.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:57.000\nLike all of them except for Dublin, you know, like I, I, I, all the country of Dublin.\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:00.000\nI thought, I thought, I thought you said city.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:05.000\nThe, the, the, the, they're just, they're just poor potato people.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.000\nThey just grew with the potato.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:10.000\nThey just, they're just, they're just dirty little people.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:17.000\nAnd they, and they had to, they, they, they, they, they.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:21.000\nI wish, I wish that was inflammatory enough for you to get letters about that.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:25.000\nNo, they don't care because they've been dirty potato people.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:26.000\nThey're fine with that.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nThey don't care.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nThey, they, they have a great sense of humor.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:31.000\nThey know they're not affected.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:36.000\nI think, I think everybody cares about you when you call them dirty little people.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nYou're wrong.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:43.000\nI, we, we had our Irish friend, Gremlin, I had here last, last, last a couple of weeks ago.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nThat dirty little guy.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nShut up, madam.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:51.000\nIf, if you told him, I, I called Irish people dirty little potato people.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nNot on Twitter though, out of context.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:54.000\nDon't.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:58.000\nBut, like, he, he, like, yeah, that's, that about sums it up.\n\n19:58.000 --> 19:59.000\nYou said it, you said it in context though.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:03.000\nYou, you called Irish people dirty little potato people.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nYes.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:10.000\nAnd so they're, they're, all of their songs and poetry and literature and things like\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:14.000\nthey're, they're not, they don't come out of any kind of nobility or anything.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nIt's kind of like, it's very nice.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:20.000\nThey didn't really, they didn't really dawn on me until I was, until I was really learning\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:25.000\nabout it over, over mashed potatoes.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:28.000\nThey still love potatoes over there too.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:32.000\nThat their, their, their civilization exploded because of the potato.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:37.000\nThe potato became a thing like that they could do and they, they, they grew, they grew in\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:39.000\npopulation quite a bit.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:44.000\nAnd then of course there was the potato blight and then like things got real bad for them\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:52.000\nand you know, the rest is history.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:57.000\nCan you sing a little Irish song for us about it?\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:58.000\nThat's, that's what she would do.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:06.000\nShe would go like, oh, and there's a, there's a, one of the fairies of, of, of the, of the\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:10.000\npotato patch was the shin lanan.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:16.000\nThe shin lanan was a lovely woman or take the form of a very seductive lady.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:20.000\nAnd she would come a call in when the things and blah, blah, blah.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:23.000\nAnd then, and then there's a song about her.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:26.000\nShe know you.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:31.000\nWell, that doesn't sound right.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nShe sounded beautiful.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nI bought her CD.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nThat's how beautiful she sounded.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nI don't even have a CD player.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:44.000\nI just, I just bought it because I'm like, make more music.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\nI don't know.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:47.000\nKeep making it.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nThere's a, there's a fairy of the potato patch?\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:52.000\nNo, I made that all up.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:57.000\nThere's, no, there's a, that was one of the coolest things about Irish folklore was the,\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:00.000\nthe fairy, I don't know, it's the idea of fairies.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:06.000\nLike we, we all, you know, have our understanding of fairies, like the tinkerbells and the whatnot.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:09.000\nThey're always, for us, they're always small and they always have insect wings.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:14.000\nAnd they have like, you know, like, you know, there's a very specific fairy, like kind of image we get in our head.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:23.000\nBut, but, but the word fairy originally just meant it was like, it's just kind of these crazy like magical beings that are kind of one foot in, one foot out.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:35.000\nLike as a, you know, as pre Christian mythology that got a Christianized, but like the way that they Christianized it was to say that when Lucifer,\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:42.000\nLucifer went down from heaven into hell, there were, there were a bunch of angels, you know, who were like totally like hail Lucifer,\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nI'm going to go with them right away.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:48.000\nAnd then there were like the angels that were like fuck Lucifer, I'm going to stay, stay up here.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:53.000\nBut then there were like the kind of like, I don't know, I'm going to see where the action is.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:55.000\nKind of wandering downward.\n\n22:55.000 --> 23:01.000\nAnd then there was like an angel that went to God and said, come on, give those guys a break.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nDon't, don't make them go all the way to hell.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:10.000\nAnd then God like snapped his fingers in at the exact moment, you know, when he, when he called, you know, it's like play it where it lays.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:21.000\nSo some, some, some angels were like, you know, in the ocean and somewhere in a rock and somewhere like had half of their head in a flower and their foot in a, you know, a pork chop or something.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:33.000\nSo, so like that's the kind of fairy you are, you know, like you're the, you're, you're, if you're, if you're going to pork chop for a foot and then like a, like a flower for a hand.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:36.000\nAnd then, but it's just like, you know, their fairies are like, they could be monsters.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:37.000\nThey're like Cinnabites.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:41.000\nThey're, they're angels to some and demons to the two others.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:44.000\nAnd a leprechaun is one of those.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:45.000\nA leprechaun is a fairy, Jeff.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:46.000\nDid you know that?\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nI did not.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:51.000\nWhat, what do they call the one that has half a foot in a pork chop?\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:56.000\nThat's, I don't, that's a sin fire.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nDid you enjoy Venice Italy?\n\n23:58.000 --> 23:59.000\nHow was that for you?\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nDid you know, did you know a banshee is also a fairy?\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:02.000\nI did not know.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:03.000\nThey're all fairies.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nEvery, every monster you could name, werewolves or fairies.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:08.000\nI made that up.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nHow was, how was Venice for you?\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:11.000\nDo you enjoy that?\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nVenice was cool.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:19.000\nI got to walk around Venice like by myself on Christmas Eve.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:23.000\nIt was crazy because I didn't even realize until the daylight,\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:26.000\nlike how crowded that city can get in the winter.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:31.000\nIt's pretty dead, which is why Peter Weller recommended it in his architecture blog,\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nwhich Aaron read.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:37.000\nThe reason we went to Venice is because Aaron read this article by Peter Weller,\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:43.000\nwho is not only Robocop apparently, but is also a PhD in like Renaissance architecture.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nIt's a huge history in that, yeah.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:50.000\nAnd is arguably like more into like Renaissance architecture than being into Robocop.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:56.000\nI don't, like, but, but like, we were joking about,\n\n24:56.000 --> 25:00.000\nbecause in the article he talks about why you should go to Venice in the winter,\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:01.000\nwhy it's so beautiful.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:10.000\nAnd, you know, so Aaron booked all this travel based on this like article that he wrote.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:14.000\nAnd we did, we went, we're going to a lot of the places that he recommended\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:17.000\nand we kept joking like, I will probably run into Peter Weller.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:20.000\nBut so we finished dinner on Christmas, Christmas day.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:23.000\nWas it, was it Christmas, was it Christmas night?\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:28.000\nAnd yeah, finished dinner and went down to get our coats and we're putting on our coats\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:31.000\nand like this kind of coat room and then in walks Peter Weller.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:32.000\nNo.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nYeah.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:37.000\nAnd like, just froze.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:41.000\nAnd Aaron looked at me like gave me this look that was like silently communicating like,\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.000\nlike, should I?\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nAnd I'm like, yeah, fucking go for it.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:48.000\nLike, because I'm not going to talk to him like about like,\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nI'm not going to go like dead or alive.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nYou're coming to Venice.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:55.000\nLike, all I'm going to talk about is Robocop.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:59.000\nTalk to him about fucking this bullshit you read him about.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nAnd she's like, excuse me.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:02.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:07.000\nWe, we, we read, we read your article about about Venice in the winter.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:11.000\nAnd he's like, no, you're here.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:18.000\nHe kind of held his hands out like, and the amazing thing is you have to,\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:22.000\nyou have to understand like Peter Weller like while the beautiful Christmas miracle.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:25.000\nThis is like fucking Peter Weller.\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:32.000\nBut while he's, while he's talking to us, people are, he's speaking in Italian to these,\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:38.000\nyou know, people who are putting his winter clothes back on him.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:46.000\nAnd so as he's speaking to Aaron about Venice, he's becoming this old Italian man because\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:49.000\nlike the cape and the scarf and the hat are going on.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:53.000\nSo it's like, like, like kind of like Robocop kind of came in and it was like,\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:57.000\nand then it talked to, and then he slowly became like, you know, I don't know,\n\n26:57.000 --> 27:01.000\nhe just started, like, he became like one of those cool old guys that walks through\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:05.000\nlike an Italian city like, like, like at night, like looking at a pocket watch\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:08.000\nand eating a, eating a panini.\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:14.000\nBut, but, so, so he just, he just talked to Aaron for like, you know, 15 minutes or so\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:18.000\nabout like, like how cool Venice is and why he wrote that article and\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:24.000\nI just, I just sat there and stared like, yeah, that's it.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:28.000\nThat's all, that's, you know, if Aaron's got a different version of that story, but\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.000\nI love that.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:30.000\nIt was pretty, it was pretty amazing.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:32.000\nIt was like, this is a really magical thing.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:35.000\nLike when you, when you, when something like that happens, you kind of like,\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:40.000\nyou kind of, you kind of gather, gather it up in a little jar and you kind of like\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:44.000\njust want to run out like right away, but you make it last as long as you can.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:46.000\nYou try not to, you know, overkill.\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:50.000\nLike when she was kind of like ran around the corner and we're like skipping,\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:53.000\ngoing like, he's right behind us.\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:57.000\nHe's right behind us, but like, gotta, gotta get somewhere safe so we can like\n\n27:57.000 --> 28:02.000\njust crack up and like roll around on the cobble, like, like, like freaking out.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:06.000\nLike how, like, like repeating every, every, every word.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:07.000\nThat's so good.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:10.000\nHe had a purple cashmere scarf.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nIt had to be a gift.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:17.000\nLike, like, it looked, it looked so odd.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:20.000\nI think someone gave him a purple cashmere scarf.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nHe might have bought it for a dollar.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:24.000\nHe might have bought it for a dollar.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nAdam, let's do it.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:28.000\nWow.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:32.000\nI'm sad that I got that joke.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nDo you ever see the new RoboCop?\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:35.000\nNo.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nYeah, I saw it.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:41.000\nDid they, did they stick with a new outfit or did they, they redid the outfit?\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:42.000\nDid they redo it?\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:43.000\nYeah.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nYeah, and they make a point of redoing it?\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:48.000\nLike, like, they have a scene where a guy goes like, you should make it black.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nI don't understand what they were doing.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:51.000\nI don't get it.\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nI don't like it.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:55.000\nI don't like, I don't like it.\n\n28:55.000 --> 29:00.000\nI did some terrible, terrible movie that never, never was released with Kurt Wood Smith\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nand he was in it, we'd never worked together.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:05.000\nAnd he sat in front of me at the screening and it was so bad.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:10.000\nAnd I just, I was freaking out because RoboCop, Kurt Wood Smith was in front of me.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:15.000\nAnd at the end he grabs me, I was dead on page 40 and at the end of the movie he grabs me\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:22.000\nby my collar, by my tie and pulls me towards me and goes, boy, did they kill you too early.\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:26.000\nI got out where the getting was good.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:29.000\nCabin Times, what was that called?\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:35.000\nIt was called Cabin Times.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:39.000\nWell, it wasn't Cabin Fever because that's a thing, right?\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:42.000\nIt was called...\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:43.000\nIt's something Cabin.\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:44.000\nNo, it's not Cabin.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nDeadly Cabin.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nI wish it was called Deadly Cabin.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nIt's called Evil Remains.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:51.000\nOh, Evil Remains.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:56.000\nColin, it's Cabin Time.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nIt took place in a cabin.\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:01.000\nThere was a cabin for certain.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:02.000\nI've never seen that one.\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nDon't.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:09.000\nIt's a horror movie and I went to the screening of it and Kurt Wood Smith was in front of me\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:14.000\nand the other actors in the film and they brought a bunch of people into the Lemley Theater\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:18.000\nlike in the Sunset Boulevard thingy, whatever the fuck it is.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:20.000\nAnd it's so bad.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:25.000\nI think the audience thought it was a comedy and so then they just started laughing to the whole thing.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:28.000\nBut it's not a comedy either.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nBut nobody thought it was scary either.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:34.000\nSo it became a comedy and we were just sinking down into our seats.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nAnd it was really bad.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nReally, really, really bad.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:41.000\nWell, all right, let's see what else we got here.\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:48.000\nI ran into a kid in Paris that learned English from watching Community and Sopranos.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:51.000\nCan you do an impression of what that would be like?\n\n30:51.000 --> 31:03.000\nWell, no, I mean, there's no, you know, what do you, like he would say, bada-bada-boom, a pop-pop or, you know.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:04.000\nMet about it.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:08.000\nMet about it.\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:11.000\nAnd there was another kid there and he had this, well, whatever.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nNo one's interested in that.\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nNo, I've told it like three times and no one cares.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:19.000\nThere was this other French kid that showed up.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:22.000\nAnd he had an app on his phone that he showed me.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:25.000\nI just thought it was kind of interesting because it's like, I don't know.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:29.000\nForeign people, we don't know anything about them.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:32.000\nWhat are they doing?\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:44.000\nLike how could your show that you write had never having been outside of the country, you know, how could it ever be appealing to like, you know, like people who don't speak the same language when they're in grade school.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nDid he watch it in French or in English?\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:49.000\nWell, I think they watch it in English.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:59.000\nLike I said, one of them would watch it with French subtitles on first and then change them to English subtitles and then eventually turn the subtitles off.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nThat's something they do there.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:11.000\nThey're so steeped in English, like, you know, more so than we are steeped in French, that it's a little, it's a little more natural for them to be able to do that.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:14.000\nBut rest assured, we are a lazy bunch.\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:16.000\nI really am.\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:19.000\nI can't, I can't, I can't just, I can't do it.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:24.000\nLike, I can't, like, like Aaron, Aaron knows definitely more French than me.\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:41.000\nBut like, also, I think there's this crucial thing where it's like, there's just a shamelessness of like, you have to, you can't, you can't like, you have to like just be willing to speak wrong in order to ever successfully speak to someone who speaks a different language.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:46.000\nYou can't be like this held up by this, like, like, there's just fear that like seizes me.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:51.000\nYou know, you just end up going like, oh, oh, oh, bonjour.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:54.000\nLe bacon.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:55.000\nLe bacon.\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:56.000\nLe bacon.\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.000\nLike, like, le bacon.\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nSorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:01.000\nGood day.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:06.000\nThe bacon.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:16.000\nBut, but Aaron would kind of like slide, you know, slide into the French Uber and just be like, and the driver would be like, huh?\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:29.000\nBut, but, but then like a couple minutes later, he'd be like, are they both doing a bit or they're like talking to each other about stuff.\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nAnd then Aaron, Aaron got like bronchitis.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:38.000\nShe thought she might have pneumonia, so she got up in the middle of the night, she's like coughing up a lung and she got on the phone.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:43.000\nAnd then she's like, I can't do an impression of it because it's like fluent French.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:46.000\nI know she's like speaking to somebody about getting a doctor.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:50.000\nLike she called somewhere in Paris, like a regular person trying to get a doctor.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:53.000\nAnd it was like, oh, it's just we train a lot.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nLike, what the fuck?\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:59.000\nJesus Christ, she's speaking French about dying and being sick and stuff.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:04.000\nBecause it was like she took out sticks and made a fire.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:07.000\nAnd then she puked at very size.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:14.000\nWell, I think we'll let her tell that story.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:17.000\nYeah, I mean, you know, what else am I going to talk about?\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:20.000\nWho cares, right?\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:40.000\nI want to bring up my honeymoon wife, Erin McGathy.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:41.000\nDid you guys do it French style?\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:44.000\nYou kiss both cheeks?\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:49.000\nWe didn't.\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:50.000\nI don't know.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:51.000\nYou healthy again?\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:52.000\nI am.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:56.000\nJust recently, though, I still have a little thing in my throat.\n\n34:56.000 --> 35:02.000\nAnd today I did it like a Channel 101 pilot and there was an older woman there.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:05.000\nThis actress who was brought in who I don't think knew anybody.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:09.000\nAnd I coughed and like she had done some very nice women,\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:15.000\nbut she had done some like very like six seeming things earlier that made me kind of worried about her health.\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:20.000\nLike there was a fog machine and she said, Oh, is something on fire?\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:26.000\nAnd I said, Oh, no, that's that's a fog machine and it's just it's just vapor.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:29.000\nAnd she was like, OK, OK, don't want anything to be on fire.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nAnd I was like, yeah, no one does great.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:36.000\nBut then 10 minutes later, she she looked at me like she was looking through the pizza.\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:39.000\nAlso, she was like examining the pizza, which is strange.\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:43.000\nBut she had eaten pizza and was just looking seeing all the pizza.\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nAnd then she looked at me and she said, Is something on fire?\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nAnd I was like, Ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:51.000\nShe was like, Is something on fire?\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\nNo, it's a fog machine.\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:54.000\nIt's vapor.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.000\nAnd she was like, OK.\n\n35:56.000 --> 36:01.000\nBut then five minutes later, I coughed and she said, You need to get some help.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:06.000\nSo I guess I'm still a little sick.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nYeah, you know, you don't sound that good.\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:12.000\nLike in bed at night.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:22.000\nOh, no, we sleep we sleep together.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:27.000\nBut we're not always sleeping.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:33.000\nRight, because she keeps coughing.\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:41.000\nWell, then why don't you start living?\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:47.000\nYeah, no, I got I was very, very sick and I was very proud of myself for calling the French doctor.\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:54.000\nAnd the French doctor came and gave me prescribed me some antibiotics and they made me violently ill.\n\n36:54.000 --> 37:00.000\nAnd I threw up in Versailles after doing a ton of research and trying to convince him to go.\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:05.000\nAnd it was very self-righteous about how great I am about enjoying historical things.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:12.000\nAnd I threw up right on history and was ushered out, escorted out while the tour continued.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:13.000\nAnd I just slept.\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:17.000\nOh, I didn't tell you this because I was very ashamed and I thought you'd be embarrassed.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:21.000\nBut when I was escorted out, I was so sick.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:24.000\nAnd you know, when you're sick, you want to put your face up against something cold.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:33.000\nAnd so I was lying in the courtyard of Versailles with my face just on the stone.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:49.000\nLiterally like behind the golden gates where we were the sixteenth for summary internet and the people of France looked in wanting to be there.\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nBecause that's what the French Revolution is, right?\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nI'm just kidding.\n\n37:53.000 --> 38:01.000\nAnyway, I was lying on the ground at Versailles, but put my very fancy coat over me so people didn't think I was homeless and it worked out.\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:04.000\nHomeless people hate insulation.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:10.000\nWell, I was just like, well, I mean, because I definitely looked like there was something wrong, but I was on the inside of the gate.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:15.000\nSo I clearly bought a ticket, but people don't usually lie on the ground with their face on the stone or Versailles.\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:19.000\nSo you put your coat over yourself so that people just thought you were a corpse?\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:28.000\nWell, I put it over my shoulder and then I had my little guidebook so it looked like I was kind of doing something.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:38.000\nI was very sick. You know, when you position yourself in a sleeping position, when you have to sleep and you want people to think that you're doing it on purpose, it was that kind of thing.\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:40.000\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:46.000\nWell, have you ever tried to fake sleeping in an educational situation?\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:50.000\nLike, you mean like putting your head down?\n\n38:50.000 --> 39:02.000\nYeah, like in school you're sleeping, you have your hand on your face and just your head down and then a book and you learn how to hold a pen while you're sleeping so it looks like you're doing something.\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:05.000\nI'm just glad you didn't make me go.\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.000\nYou didn't go?\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:19.000\nYou said you don't. You're like, why would I want to go to some guy's house?\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:24.000\nAnd the only answer is, oh, this guy was really rich.\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:27.000\nNo, I'm not going to have this argument.\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nHe told everybody what to do.\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:33.000\nYeah, yeah, that's so stupid.\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nSo you didn't go?\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:39.000\nNo, I'm not going to go to Versailles.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nAlso hates Paris.\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:49.000\nWhy is it so absurd because it's like we cut their heads off, like we hated them.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:50.000\nWe didn't do that.\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:56.000\nWe being modern people, we turned our back on the idea of all that shitty fucking.\n\n39:56.000 --> 40:00.000\nYeah, well, I wasn't going because I was like, the way they did the wallpaper.\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:02.000\nYes, shoot.\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:05.000\nThat's exactly why people go.\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:08.000\nNo, that's not why people go.\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:17.000\nI'm walking through and I'm like, oh, this is where the royal court met for the last time when they said,\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:21.000\nyou know, Louis XIV and Marie Antoinette, you have to stay here.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:26.000\nYou have to stay hostage because we have this big list of people who are going to be beheaded.\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:29.000\nAnd there are these moments, so many moments.\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:36.000\nAnd Marie Antoinette is Austrian and she's 14 years old and she's married right away.\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:40.000\nAnd she goes into her room and she's like, ah, this is this is my life.\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:41.000\nAnd my life is perfect.\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nAnd my life is or my life is my life is terrible.\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\nOh, so many dresses and she has no idea what's going on.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:50.000\nAnd you get to be in these halls or people have been.\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:54.000\nI mean, I care more about that stuff, obviously.\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:56.000\nDo you think Peter Weller would have enjoyed that?\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:57.000\nWell, of course.\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:58.000\nYeah, yeah, that's what I mean.\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:05.000\nThat's the amazing thing about Peter Weller is he's he's part Dan, part Aaron, all.\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:06.000\nAll purple scar.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:08.000\nHe cares about architecture.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:09.000\nHe was Robocop.\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:10.000\nYeah.\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:12.000\nI mean, it's also it's also magnificent.\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:15.000\nWhat did you do instead Dan that day?\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:16.000\nAt that.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:21.000\nWell, at that particular time, when she was at Versailles, I found a bar I could drink\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:24.000\nin in Paris because it was a British themed bar.\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:27.000\nSo it was just made to be like a pub.\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nI can't like it's hard.\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:33.000\nThey don't have like a burgeoning cocktail culture in Paris.\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:34.000\nThey do.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:36.000\nI mean, I went to Paris for the first time.\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:38.000\nI never I've never spent any time there like alone.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:43.000\nSo I went there alone in the first week of December and I had friends there that are\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\nthese Parisian rock and rollers.\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:46.000\nThey're very cool.\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\nAnd they kind of showed me around the first night and then it was on my own.\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:51.000\nAnd I kind of like I kind of failed.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:54.000\nLike I wasn't like like doing anything cool.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:57.000\nI was seeing some sites went to went to see the museums and whatnot.\n\n41:57.000 --> 42:02.000\nBut like I was intimidated by the I don't speak any French except the how do you do\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:04.000\nthis and pleases and thank yous and stuff.\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:08.000\nAnd I asked my friends like how come girls here just do not look at you?\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:11.000\nLike as in New York a week before people like flirt with each other.\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:15.000\nThey make eye contact and they look at you and either have a fuck that guy or that guy's\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\ngood looking or they don't care.\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nIn Paris girls are gorgeous.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nEverybody's fucking skinny for some reason.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:24.000\nAnd they all they're all smoking and nobody makes eye contact.\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:28.000\nAnd my friend who's from there he goes he's a girl in Paris.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:32.000\nIf she looks at you one time that means she is very interested in you.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:36.000\nIf she looks at you a second time that means she is going to fuck you.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:40.000\nAnd I said I didn't get the fucking first look yet.\n\n42:40.000 --> 42:43.000\nAnd then the last day I was there I went to this fancy cake place.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:47.000\nLike a gâteau something you know like a what do you call it?\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:48.000\nPâtisserie.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:50.000\nAnd really fancy place.\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:53.000\nI found out a way to get French girls to look at you.\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nWalk around with a really nice box of cake.\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:59.000\nI had a white box of gold lettering and girls just like turning their heads.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:01.000\nThey want to know what's in that fucking box.\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:03.000\nSo did you.\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nSo if they're...\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.000\nOui.\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:18.000\nSo I went to a club one night and there was on the carpet this place is called Che Castel.\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:22.000\nAnd the carpet is all dicks, pussies and tits.\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:26.000\nOrnate carpet if you look at it closely it's all this weird horny thing.\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:28.000\nAnd down in the basement there's this piano.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:32.000\nAnd it was Serge Gainsbourg's old piano where he used to go play it kind of as his second home.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:35.000\nAnd there's a cigarette burns from his cigarettes on it.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nI went there one night and there was nobody there.\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:40.000\nOn the last night I was there I met these people.\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:42.000\nAnd they took me...\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:46.000\nI went to La Peruse this place like right on the scene.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:49.000\nWhich is like from the 1700s and like Victor Hugo used to go there.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:53.000\nAnd I just did my old experiment of just going to a place and posting up.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nSitting at one place all night long.\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nNo one talked to me for two hours.\n\n43:57.000 --> 44:00.000\nAnd at the end they're like they kick everybody else out but they go you can stay.\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:02.000\nAnd then at the end they're like...\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:04.000\nThere was a girl there that I loved. She was so beautiful.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nAnd she actually made eye contact with me.\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:08.000\nAnd she was like the DJ there.\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:10.000\nOr one of the DJs and they took me...\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:12.000\nThey're like you come to this club with us.\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:14.000\nI go should I like meet you there?\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:16.000\nAnd they go no, you walk with me.\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:18.000\nAnd we went there and down in the basement.\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.000\nWhere I'd been before.\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:22.000\nNow it's filled with people smoky. People playing piano.\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nGirls start taking their shirts off.\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:26.000\nAnd guys lighting cigarettes with them.\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:28.000\nThey're dancing with their shirts off.\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:30.000\nIt was so fucking French I couldn't believe it.\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:32.000\nThey're lighting the women on fire?\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:34.000\nNo, no.\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:36.000\nThere was a girl. She took her shirt off.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:39.000\nShe's laying on the piano and a guy that she doesn't know.\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nThere's a picture on my Instagram.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nAnd this guy is a really good looking guy.\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nLights a cigarette and puts it in her mouth.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nAnd on my Instagram she's like who is that guy?\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nThey all took me to this party afterwards.\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:52.000\nWhere there was three girls.\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.000\nThe girl who was one of the DJs.\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:57.000\nAnd these two guys in this crazy house.\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nIt was like if MC Escher and Frank Geary\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:02.000\nmade a really gay Parisian house together.\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.000\nStairways that went nowhere.\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nYou have a push on a wall and the whole thing opens up.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nAnd some floors are glass.\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:10.000\nYou can see down to the bathroom.\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:12.000\nOr you can see through to that room.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\nYou can't see into that room.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:16.000\nYou can look from one room into another.\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:20.000\nAnd the top floor is one giant bed.\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.000\nAnd I get up there and they go,\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:25.000\none of the girls goes, Jeff, you are gay, no?\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.000\nAnd I said, no.\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nI ripped my coat off, ripped my jacket off,\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nripped my tie off.\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nAnd all of them took their fucking shirts off\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:34.000\nand started making eye with me.\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:35.000\nHow is the pastry?\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:38.000\nHuh?\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nAnd then, so while that's happening,\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:41.000\nthis guy comes up.\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:43.000\nThis guy named O'Reilly Austin.\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nHe comes up and he lays down\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nlike 15 feet away from us, lays down sideways\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:48.000\nand smoking a cigarette.\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nAnd one of the girls in France is like,\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nlike, O'Reilly Austin, do you want to come and join?\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:55.000\nAnd he goes, no.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:58.000\nAnd just sat there smoking and digging it.\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:00.000\nWait, he was just...\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nHe wanted to watch.\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:06.000\nSo a couple nights ago, there's this...\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:09.000\nI was telling the story to some friends of mine.\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nAnd because our friend from France was showing up,\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nhis famous hairdresser from Charlie LeMindu,\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nhe does like Lady Gaga's hair.\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:18.000\nHe's like a super duper famous French hairstylist.\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:21.000\nAnd he shows up and I just told the story.\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:23.000\nAnd I said, you know La Peruse?\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:25.000\nAnd he goes, yeah, I do a night show once a month.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.000\nI promote the night there.\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:29.000\nI go, oh, I was just telling them about this girl.\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:31.000\nAnd he goes, was it Amre?\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:32.000\nI go, yeah.\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:35.000\nAnd he goes, yeah, she rapes all the men.\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:44.000\nIt was fucking French.\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\nAnd my car came at 8.30.\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:48.000\nIt was fucking French.\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:52.000\nThey had written all over me.\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:55.000\nI had writing on my arm and on my face and my neck and my shirt.\n\n46:55.000 --> 47:00.000\nThey kept writing on me like this is the back of the pocket square.\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:03.000\nAnd I got to the airport and I was just covered in writing.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:06.000\nAnd the French guys at the airport seemed to like,\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:09.000\nthat was just another day of the office for them.\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:13.000\nIt does get very French in Paris.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:16.000\nIt does.\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:19.000\nIt's like these French have got a different word for everything.\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:23.000\nWe were there on New Year's Eve and in this,\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:26.000\nI had some friends that we ran into from New York\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:30.000\nand we were in this club at like up until 5 a.m.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:33.000\nAnd when we walked in there, we were like, oh, cool, cool club.\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:37.000\nAnd it was all red and the music, the music's terrible.\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:38.000\nParis?\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:41.000\nWell, I mean, I'm sure not, not across the board,\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:43.000\nbut where we were, it was pretty bad.\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:46.000\nIt was like a, whatever the, what it's called,\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:53.000\nwhen you type it words into a website and then it gives it back to you.\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nTranslation?\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:58.000\nYeah, like a translator, but what you want to say.\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:01.000\nLike a Stephen Hawking, like automated.\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:05.000\nI know there are many obvious words that I'm forgetting.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:09.000\nAnyway, we were in this place where this DJ was typing words into like\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:14.000\nsome sort of like child's toy or a deaf person's toy\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:18.000\nand was playing it with like a heavy beat underneath\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:21.000\nand everyone was really into it.\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nExcept for the deaf people.\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:27.000\nIronically, even though their life is a game.\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:29.000\nWe, we, we,\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:34.000\nThis is the one, the one time.\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:36.000\nI mean, it's a choice.\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:41.000\nBut I, we're at the door and I speak very, I speak very little French,\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:44.000\nbut it was at the door and like spoke enough French to the guy\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:47.000\nthat somehow like we got into this club that was like a private party\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:50.000\nand everyone's dancing and then everyone's making out\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:52.000\nand then people are taking people's faces and saying,\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:54.000\nno you make out, no you make out.\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:57.000\nLike we're not a part of this. Like we're very obvious.\n\n48:57.000 --> 49:01.000\nWe're just watching all of this happen.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:05.000\nBut every, everyone is, there's this, just this very free energy\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:08.000\nand it started when I was like, are we at like a very special free club?\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nBut I think it's just like a French thing.\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:15.000\nBut the height of it was when a guy came downstairs who looked like\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:19.000\nA jolly old elf.\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:21.000\nAnd he had this sack full of presents.\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:24.000\nLike when you, when you watch, if you were to watch a 70,\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:28.000\na biopic about a very famous hairdresser from the 70s,\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\nthis would be that guy.\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:35.000\nHe came down wearing a beret, which they, they do.\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:36.000\nThey really, well it was crazy.\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:38.000\nLike it just seems so on their nose.\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:39.000\nThey actually, they do wear berets.\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:40.000\nThey wear berets.\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:45.000\nI actually, I heard one totally non-Iranic, ooh la la.\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:50.000\nI went to McDonald's and they said bon appetit.\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.000\nAnd I was like, ah!\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:55.000\nThey just, they just laughed.\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:56.000\nWait, wait, I have a question.\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:59.000\nWhy did you go to a fucking McDonald's in Paris?\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:02.000\nOh, well because everything was, was, we, we,\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:05.000\nwe went because the kids that Dan met at that bar were talking about it\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:08.000\nlike it was the most amazing restaurant in the world.\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nAnd we just, I just thought, I thought it was funny.\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:11.000\nI did it.\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:13.000\nThe kids call it Macdo.\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:19.000\nBut anyway, this guy, the guy's wearing, the guy's wearing this beret\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:23.000\nand he comes down, he comes down into this dance floor.\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:26.000\nAnd this club, this club is called Bonnie and Clyde\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:30.000\nand it's in the Pigalle and it's like the cool like hipster club.\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:34.000\nAnd the, the bathroom was crazy.\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:40.000\nThe bathroom was crazy because you like wait in line for the bathroom\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:44.000\nand you, you get to where like it would split off into like\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:47.000\nmen's or women's or two stalls or three stalls.\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:51.000\nThere's one stall that has a door and then there's like a trough\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:53.000\nor urinal, but it's like right there.\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:56.000\nSo if you're standing in line and a guy just has to pee\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nlike he'll stand there and pee.\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:01.000\nBut the more shocking thing about this, it became,\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:06.000\nif you were a man who had to shit, you had to wait for this other thing.\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:09.000\nAnd I learned very quick, like I learned a lot of French for,\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nI, I am so sorry.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:15.000\nI am going to shit before you.\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:17.000\nAnyway, this guy comes down with a parade.\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:18.000\nThen you would take someone's butt and go like,\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:22.000\nnow you shit over here and you pee, you pee in his shit.\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:25.000\nNo, it was, it was just weird because like, I mean,\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:27.000\nit was weird for a second.\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:30.000\nBut when I say weird, I mean, it was, it was actually like this,\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:33.000\nthis really like neat human moment where it was like,\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:36.000\nyeah, we're all in this together.\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:39.000\nLike knowing when a man has to shit, but then also the women\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:41.000\nget to maintain this mystery of like,\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:43.000\nyou don't know what's going to happen in there for me.\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:45.000\nBut like for a man, like it's like,\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:47.000\nI poop will be coming out of my butt.\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:49.000\nAnd that is why I am waiting in this line and\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:52.000\npoop will come out of my butt before you do whatever mystery\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nyou'll do in there.\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:55.000\nAnyway, this guy came down.\n\n51:55.000 --> 52:00.000\nYou guys had a very different Paris experience than I had.\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:03.000\nThis guy had a beret and a cape and came to the middle\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:07.000\nof the dance floor and a cape, a long cape and,\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:11.000\nand not, not heels, but men's heels.\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:15.000\nLike when you see pictures of, of like restoration heels,\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:17.000\nlike French restoration heels, like they were clearly men's\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:21.000\nshoes, but he was wearing heels and just started very\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nsincerely voguing.\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:29.000\nAnd I, I was looking around at every, no, no reaction,\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:31.000\nno reaction.\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:33.000\nAnd it was amazing and beautiful.\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:36.000\nAnd like he saw me looking at him and then was like,\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\nall right, this is the time when I do this,\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nwhen I do this for you.\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:43.000\nAnd I just sat there while this man voked for me.\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.000\nWhile you're waiting to take a shit?\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:47.000\nNo.\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:49.000\nThis is in the, yeah.\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:52.000\nThis is in the, this is in the dance, the dance room.\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:53.000\nAll right.\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:54.000\nAll right.\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:55.000\nWell.\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:56.000\nAh, Kelly.\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:57.000\nYeah.\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nDan, Dan, thumbs up, thumbs down on Paris.\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:00.000\nWhat do you, do you like it?\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\nI'm not a Paris man, but, you know, I was,\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:05.000\nI wasn't a New York man for, for several New York visits.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:09.000\nAnd then Dino showed me the, the, the Dino side of New York.\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:10.000\nAnd now I love New York.\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\nI, someone will have to, you know,\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nParis is very intimidating to me.\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:18.000\nIt's, it's, it's for, for no, for, I'm absolutely of no,\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:23.000\nlike, like, I, I don't funnel my fear of Paris into me going,\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:26.000\noh, Paris is shitty.\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nI think the deal with Paris is,\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nif I could totally make a bunch of sweeping generalizations\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:33.000\nand speculations is that, like, even though it's a city\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:36.000\nthat everyone on the planet wants to go to,\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:38.000\nunlike other cities that everyone on the planet\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:41.000\nwants to go to, they have, they've refused to succumb\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.000\nto the tourist industry.\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:45.000\nThey, they're the tourist culture.\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nLike they all know English, but they,\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:49.000\nthat's where you get that, that, that stereotype of like,\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:51.000\nwell, you have to try speaking French,\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:52.000\notherwise they don't like you.\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nI, I finally got that when I was there.\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.000\nIt was like, I think I'm putting myself in their shoes.\n\n53:56.000 --> 54:00.000\nIt was like, oh, suppose you're, suppose you're Paris\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nand you just want to be New York.\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:05.000\nLike, like people in New York don't bend over backwards\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:07.000\nfor people that don't speak English.\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:08.000\nYeah.\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:10.000\nLike, like, in my experience, like going to Italy,\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:12.000\npeople like throw their arms around you as a stranger\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:15.000\nand some, and also Paris is not all of France.\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:18.000\nLike South of France is very different than being in Paris,\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:21.000\nwhere people, like, it's more provincial and it's less,\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:23.000\nlike, in Paris people are busy.\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:24.000\nThey got shit to do.\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\nAnd also being an American doesn't charm them.\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:28.000\nThat's not enough on its own to be interesting to them.\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:29.000\nThey got shit to do.\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:32.000\nI went to go buy a razor because I left my razor in New York\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nand I went to a very busy, like, drug store\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:36.000\nand I found the razor.\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:38.000\nAnd I was hoping that I could just walk up,\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:40.000\nput the razor on the thing.\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:41.000\nShe would type it up.\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:42.000\nI would see a number.\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:45.000\nI would overbid on Euros.\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:47.000\nShe would give me a lot of change and that would be the end of it.\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nAnd she goes, she rings it up.\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:50.000\nI put the money.\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:54.000\nShe goes, I don't know.\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:57.000\nAnd she's like, why not?\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.000\nIn perfect English.\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:03.000\nI go, I don't speak French.\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:06.000\nAnd she goes, like, why?\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:09.000\nAnd I said, one phrase I know.\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nI said, j'espère qu'en jeu je parlerai bien en français.\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nLike, one day I hope I can speak French well.\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:16.000\nAnd she goes, en jeu?\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:19.000\nLike, one day.\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:21.000\nLike, you're fucking, you're here now.\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:25.000\nI go, lady, give me the fucking razor.\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:27.000\nAnd she fucking died laughing.\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:28.000\nLike, she loved it.\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:29.000\nLike, they'll give you shit.\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:31.000\nYou can give them shit back.\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:33.000\nI'm like, I had you said I hope\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:34.000\nI go, one day I'll speak French well.\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:36.000\nAnd then she was giving me shit back.\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:38.000\nThey're not mean.\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:40.000\nThey just got shit to do.\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:42.000\nAnd I think they're quite charming now.\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:44.000\nI think it's a city that people go to\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:46.000\nto have like fantasies and dreams and things.\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:50.000\nLike, like, but it's not, like...\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:52.000\nLike Barfing and Versailles.\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:54.000\nLike when you go to Venice,\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:58.000\nevery other building is either a hotel or a Paris store.\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:04.960\nIt's obvious that, like, there's not, obviously tourism is, like, it's infused to the culture.\n\n56:04.960 --> 56:10.640\nLike, if you're gonna roll your eyes at the idea that you have visitors, then you're an\n\n56:10.640 --> 56:12.400\nidiot as a Venetian, I think.\n\n56:12.400 --> 56:15.400\nLike, the die is cast for them.\n\n56:15.400 --> 56:19.400\nAnd for Paris, they're like, look, I understand that you're an awaking dream, because of the\n\n56:19.400 --> 56:25.320\nEiffel Tower's over my shoulder, but I got shit to do, and I'm not being a prick to\n\n56:25.320 --> 56:26.320\nyou.\n\n56:26.320 --> 56:32.040\nLike, when you wander into my bar, and you're kind of like, you know, you're just in a different\n\n56:32.040 --> 56:37.160\nmindset as a tourist, you're like, like, oh, like, you're off work, you're not working.\n\n56:37.160 --> 56:42.160\nAnd it's, yeah, whatever, we've beat this horse dead, but it's, I think there's just\n\n56:42.160 --> 56:47.440\ncities that make that choice, like, it's a binary thing, almost, they go like, okay,\n\n56:47.440 --> 56:48.440\nlet's face it.\n\n56:48.440 --> 56:49.440\nI think there'll be a trip for you.\n\n56:49.440 --> 56:50.440\nPeople are coming here to visit.\n\n56:50.440 --> 56:54.200\nI could see you liking it, because I think that's kind of the great thing about it, because\n\n56:54.200 --> 56:59.280\nI think that the turn off about the touristy stuff, obviously, is like, the selfie stick,\n\n56:59.280 --> 57:02.120\nyou have to buy the selfie stick, take the selfie stick, but it's kind of neat to just\n\n57:02.120 --> 57:03.120\nkind of...\n\n57:03.120 --> 57:07.520\nIf I got comfortable, it would be, yeah, several, several visits, whatever.\n\n57:07.520 --> 57:15.360\nWhat I was blown away by is I had that box of cake, and I went to a little cafe and said,\n\n57:15.360 --> 57:19.720\nlike, near the Eiffel Tower, I asked a waiter, is it okay if I eat this here?\n\n57:19.720 --> 57:24.040\nAnd he's like, only if you share with me.\n\n57:24.040 --> 57:25.600\nHe wanted it in that fucking cake box.\n\n57:25.600 --> 57:26.600\nI had two little cakes.\n\n57:26.600 --> 57:29.720\nThis is the story that blew Jeff away.\n\n57:29.720 --> 57:38.280\nThe story where he went into a sex dungeon.\n\n57:38.280 --> 57:41.400\nI know he didn't say it, but time travel was applied.\n\n57:41.400 --> 57:49.240\nSo I just like that the cursor to that, the cake story, was, this is what blew me away.\n\n57:49.240 --> 57:50.240\nThis is what blew you.\n\n57:50.240 --> 57:57.280\nYou were at the airport, and it said, like, whore on your forehead.\n\n57:57.280 --> 58:04.400\nYou should write a new manual for men to replace the gay, which is such a pile of bullshit.\n\n58:04.400 --> 58:07.920\nJust called the box of cake.\n\n58:07.920 --> 58:11.760\nAnd we can just see men carrying around beautiful boxes of cake.\n\n58:11.760 --> 58:19.200\nWhat's the museum where all the, like, the Lizen Valides, where all the Napoleon's tomb\n\n58:19.200 --> 58:21.080\nis, where all the armory and all that shit is.\n\n58:21.080 --> 58:25.440\nI walked in there, and then I went, I didn't finish all the cake, and so I went into the,\n\n58:25.440 --> 58:34.640\nyou sat at Napoleon's grave with the cake, and Napoleon was like, oh, you're going to\n\n58:34.640 --> 58:38.600\nshare that with me.\n\n58:38.600 --> 58:43.280\nI was in Napoleon's tomb with my half-eaten cake, and then I had the box, and then I went\n\n58:43.280 --> 58:51.040\nacross the road to the Musée Rodin, and I wanted to see the statue of Honoré de Balzac.\n\n58:51.040 --> 58:55.320\nI walk in there, and these two security guards come charging at me, and I'm assuming they're\n\n58:55.320 --> 58:58.240\ngoing to go, you can't bring food in here.\n\n58:58.240 --> 59:00.800\nAnd they're like, what is this?\n\n59:00.800 --> 59:02.800\nAnd I open it up and show them, and I was like, is it okay?\n\n59:02.800 --> 59:06.680\nAnd they're like, one guy's like, no, it's okay, you can bring food into the thing.\n\n59:06.680 --> 59:14.560\nAnd then the guy's like, no, no, you have to give it to me.\n\n59:14.560 --> 59:20.800\nI was like, for two euro, you walk into the fucking Musée Rodin gallery, and you're out\n\n59:20.800 --> 59:24.240\nin the fucking garden, and there's a fucking Le Pencero, there's this thinker by Rodin,\n\n59:24.240 --> 59:27.360\nand I'm fucking eating my cake, and no one gave a shit, like you couldn't bring cake\n\n59:27.360 --> 59:30.520\ninto a museum in the States, it was the best.\n\n59:30.520 --> 59:33.880\nAnd then girls walk by in the smoke, and they fucking want to know about that cake.\n\n59:33.880 --> 59:37.640\nWas this cake made out of diamonds?\n\n59:37.640 --> 59:40.040\nIt did, oh, it's so good.\n\n59:40.040 --> 59:47.200\nCome on, you guys, we keep a tight schedule on this show, and we got important shit to\n\n59:47.200 --> 59:51.200\ntalk about with Spencer Crittenden, bring him out.\n\n59:51.200 --> 01:00:10.520\nHey guys, you know, wouldn't you believe it, I read a fucking article about men carrying\n\n01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:17.760\ncakes in public, and it's a great way for men to get the female experience of always\n\n01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:23.760\nhaving eyes on them, you know, because men aren't traditionally stared out by everyone,\n\n01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.440\nwhereas women are, and it's really hard to kind of fathom that experience of all this\n\n01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:34.760\nconstant attention, but when a man is holding a cake, they get all that attention.\n\n01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:40.360\nAre you on PCP right now?\n\n01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:45.760\nHis mic's just a little up, I think, but wait, doesn't this imply that all women are\n\n01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.760\nKathy?\n\n01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.880\nNo, no.\n\n01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.320\nDid you say you read an article?\n\n01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.320\nDid you really?\n\n01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.320\nOh yeah, yeah, I read an article.\n\n01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.320\nI love that.\n\n01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.320\nYeah.\n\n01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.840\nAre you being glib, or did you really read an article?\n\n01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:00.600\nWhy would I make up an article that I read?\n\n01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:07.640\nNo, this lady, she was like, it's probably really hard for, you know, guys to fathom\n\n01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:13.080\nwhat it's like to always be contemplating, you know, gazes on you, and to how that changes\n\n01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:17.640\nyour behavior and just the way you hold yourself and the way you walk, and then her partner\n\n01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:22.240\njust was, by chance, carrying a cake, and noticed that everyone was staring at him,\n\n01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:26.480\nand they talked about it, and she made this not exactly scientific test where she got\n\n01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:34.160\nguys to carry various baked goods in public, and like, a plate of cookies, you know, nothing,\n\n01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:40.160\nnothing, an exposed cake, oh boy, look out.\n\n01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.560\nLike a birthday-style cake?\n\n01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.560\nYeah, like on a stand.\n\n01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.080\nDo you think it's, well, does the article talk about, is the idea because it's, because\n\n01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:51.600\nof the psychological ramifications, the mystery behind it, or is it because everyone just\n\n01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.080\nwants that cake?\n\n01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:57.000\nI think that they said it was, it was part of that, it was both, it was, some people\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.960\nwanted the cake and wanted to make jokes about getting the cake, and other people seemed\n\n01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.320\nlike they just wanted to wait for someone to drop the cake.\n\n01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.280\nWell, a lot of times, when men look at women that they want to fuck, it looks like they\n\n01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.680\nwant to eat them.\n\n01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.680\nYeah.\n\n01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.680\nSo, it's comparable.\n\n01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:16.680\nI don't know if you guys, Dan, you don't strike me as a person that buys flowers.\n\n01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.680\n9-11.\n\n01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:25.680\nI love the idea of someone walking in for the first time, and being like, what the fuck\n\n01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:26.680\nwith them?\n\n01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:27.680\nCelebrating night.\n\n01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.120\nDan actually buys flowers very frequently.\n\n01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:37.520\nBut if you walk down, walk down the street, like in a busy, like in New York, or Seattle,\n\n01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:43.400\nor big town, walking down the road with flowers in your hand is aphrodisiac to everybody,\n\n01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:49.040\nlike everybody likes, people just like, oh, that guy thought about somebody else.\n\n01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:56.320\nI was my diet's cheat day yesterday, and I went to a Froyo place, and I got the biggest\n\n01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:03.200\nbucket they had, and I filled it a quarter of the way through, and then I put all peanut\n\n01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:07.800\nbutter cups, and then I filled it another half way through, and then I put all peanut\n\n01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.720\nbutter cups, and a little bit of crushed peanut butter cup, and then I filled it the rest\n\n01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:17.720\nof the way through, and I was just walking through Los Feliz, with, like, it was obvious\n\n01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:23.520\nthat I wasn't, like, taking it to a family, yeah, it had one spoon in it.\n\n01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:29.200\nWell, I went at the side of it, say, I said something like, just for me, you know, treating\n\n01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.200\nmyself today.\n\n01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:37.320\nYeah, special day, or something, I, I, I, I, I, I don't, I think it's a, it's a cousin\n\n01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:42.440\nof the concept, because of the prop I was carrying, I did feel like all of this extra\n\n01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:50.200\nmeaning to every, I wasn't allowed to just be in, in, in a, in a, in a shell as I walked\n\n01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:57.120\npast people, I wasn't allowed to just be anonymous, like I had this prop, and I, and so I was\n\n01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:02.520\na story to any, every, everybody in every window, it was like, yeah, laugh it up, laugh\n\n01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.520\nit up, you fuckers.\n\n01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.000\nThat's, that's just what boobs are.\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.520\nYeah, now you know how I feel, it's like I'm covered in frozen yogurt, all the time,\n\n01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:20.280\nin candies, um, so, so, so, I say in the Garfield dress.\n\n01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:27.400\nSo, I mean, like, I, I, I, I, I, I don't know what's happening to me right now, um,\n\n01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:33.440\nthe, uh, the, I, I wanted to, uh, we, we, we've been talking forever about, uh, you\n\n01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:40.360\nknow, the, the, the, like, trying a different game, from my childhood, my, my high school\n\n01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:47.600\ndays called Shadow Run, and, uh, and Spencer's been like reading the books, and like, I've,\n\n01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.680\nI've seen him outside my, uh, writer's room, like, sitting there, reading the Shadow Run\n\n01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:56.880\nbooks, getting very excited, uh, and you, like, like, we're not, we're not, we're not gonna,\n\n01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.920\nwe're not gonna play it tonight, but we're also not gonna play D&D, and we're, we'll\n\n01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:06.280\nget, hey, fuck you people, if you, if you want to know how it feels to get that kind\n\n01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:12.960\nof reaction, take up Treyah cookies, and wear them like a necklace, and then maybe you'll\n\n01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:20.040\nstart to get it, but they can't be oatmeal, because that's, it's the most masculine.\n\n01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:25.560\nYeah, um, the, uh, put, put, put a pickle behind your ear, like it's a pencil, and you're\n\n01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:31.600\nlike, uh, handy smurf, and then on the other ear, just dangle a piece of pizza.\n\n01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:37.040\nOr wear a sign, wear, wear a sign, uh, around your neck that says, I forgot your cookies.\n\n01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.040\nRight.\n\n01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.040\nYeah.\n\n01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:43.240\nYour pencil was way too big to stay tucked behind that guy's ear.\n\n01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:48.200\nIt's like a giant ass, it's like a microphone-sized pencil behind his ear.\n\n01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.600\nBut you don't know how stiff smurf cartilage is.\n\n01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.680\nIt can't be that tough, like.\n\n01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:59.360\nCan I, can I just point out very quickly that there's a man in the audience, uh, whose\n\n01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:05.560\nlaugh is identical to Judge Dooms laugh, Christopher Lloyd's character, and Roger Rabbit, right\n\n01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:09.880\nafter, when he's, when you find out he's a cartoon, and he's turning into a cartoony,\n\n01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:15.080\nlike has that maniacal laugh, Dustin Marshall, uh, pointed that out backstage a little bit.\n\n01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.560\nWho's, how's that laugh go?\n\n01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.560\nLike that.\n\n01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:23.840\nWell, I don't want to do that, just, that's not what it sounded like, and that sounded\n\n01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.040\nlike I was making fun of you, but you're, that, like that.\n\n01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.040\nIs it a good laugh?\n\n01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.800\nAre you, are you enjoying this laugh, or are you, are you?\n\n01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:33.320\nI mean, I, I mean, I've gone through at first, I was like, huh.\n\n01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:37.520\nAnd then I, and then I was like, oh, and then I was like, oh, neat.\n\n01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.520\nOkay, great.\n\n01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.520\nWe're all.\n\n01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.520\nThat's the truth.\n\n01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.520\nYeah.\n\n01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520\nNow I'm like, now I love it.\n\n01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:48.560\nNow it's like being covered in yogurt, but my yogurt for my own in front of a mirror.\n\n01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:52.200\nI'm not walking down the street, I'm in a room with mirrors and I just am seeing my\n\n01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.200\nown yogurt.\n\n01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.600\nYogurt, yogurt's a lot grosser when it's not frozen.\n\n01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.280\nCovered in my own sugar-free Greek yogurt.\n\n01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:05.720\nSpencer, do you have either logic problems with the Smurfs besides the size of a handy\n\n01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.720\nyeah.\n\n01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.280\nI mean, there's just the one lady Smurf, right?\n\n01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.280\nYeah.\n\n01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.880\nAnd they don't they lay eggs?\n\n01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:12.880\nWhat?\n\n01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:13.880\nOkay.\n\n01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:18.040\nBut you know, the lady Smurf was created by Gilgamesh.\n\n01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.040\nWhat's his name?\n\n01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.040\nThat's even more.\n\n01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.040\nYeah.\n\n01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.040\nIsn't that even Gargamel Gargamel.\n\n01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.040\nWell, he took that from Gilgamesh.\n\n01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:30.680\nIt would have been would be impressive.\n\n01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.000\nDid they come out of the mushrooms?\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.720\nShe was created by Hammurabi Smurf.\n\n01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.720\nWhere did it?\n\n01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:39.720\nDid they come?\n\n01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:40.720\nI don't know.\n\n01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.720\nI don't know.\n\n01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:42.720\nI know they're three apples high.\n\n01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.720\nBut didn't they?\n\n01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.720\nAre they?\n\n01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.720\nWhat?\n\n01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:46.720\nYeah.\n\n01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.720\nThey're supposed to be three apples tall.\n\n01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:48.720\nThose are giant fucking mushrooms.\n\n01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:53.600\nThen they look like they could be easily crushed underfoot, but three apples, man, those are\n\n01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.600\nhuge mushrooms.\n\n01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.600\nYeah, they're up to your knee.\n\n01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.560\nYou can tell from the Pac-Man cartoon that they definitely ripped off Smurfs like they\n\n01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:01.960\nhad a Gargamel figure.\n\n01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.960\nI can't remember.\n\n01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:03.960\nWhat was his name?\n\n01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:04.960\nMesmeron?\n\n01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:05.960\nAre you sure?\n\n01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:06.960\nThe Pac-Man doesn't pre-date?\n\n01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.960\nThe Pac-Man cartoon?\n\n01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:08.960\nOh, the cartoon.\n\n01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:13.480\nI didn't like the Pac-Man had hands and feet and had gloves on for some reason.\n\n01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.720\nWell, what's he supposed to do?\n\n01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.560\nWhat's the cartoon supposed to be?\n\n01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:20.480\nI'm not a rhetorical question, but what would that cartoon be?\n\n01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:25.480\nHe's just floating in space and he's like, well, I ate one dot.\n\n01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:26.480\nTime to eat another one.\n\n01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:28.480\nLike, how do you get 100 episodes out of that?\n\n01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.480\nLike, what do you do at Christmas?\n\n01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:33.480\nHe had to have gloves.\n\n01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.480\nYou have a ton of dots.\n\n01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.480\nYeah.\n\n01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.480\nThey weren't just gloves.\n\n01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.480\nThey were kind of gauntlets.\n\n01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:42.800\nHe had big, fancy gloves.\n\n01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.240\nCartoons always seem to be wearing gloves.\n\n01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.240\nYeah.\n\n01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.600\nBecause hands are scarier.\n\n01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.000\nYou could just draw the hands.\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nThe hands are like nature's gloves.\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.680\nLights the glove.\n\n01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:57.520\nAnd then you could not have the little wristy part of the glove and you'd have a hand.\n\n01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.520\nI didn't realize until we were creating a...\n\n01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.000\nThe hand fills out the glove shape perfectly.\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000\nThat's why it's that shape.\n\n01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nSorry, sorry.\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.240\nWell, I bet I know why they wear gloves, maybe because the old days like cell animation,\n\n01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:17.560\nlike the color, when you were, the way you made things move is by putting like transparency\n\n01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:18.560\non top of transparency.\n\n01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.520\nThere was always like a color differentiation between things that are moving and things\n\n01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.800\nthat are static.\n\n01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:27.360\nSo making sure that anything that's going to be moving a lot is like a different color\n\n01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.920\nthan the thing next to it, maybe, is like a good idea.\n\n01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.920\nJust a thought.\n\n01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:31.920\nRight.\n\n01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:32.920\nRight.\n\n01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:36.080\nSo if it...\n\n01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:43.840\nOf course, because we all grew up on animation, but I'm saying, you're saying what I'm saying\n\n01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:44.840\nthough, right?\n\n01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:48.200\nIs that because it's a different cell, because we've all seen those like Scooby Doo cartoons\n\n01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.920\nwhere it's like, they're walking by a mountain and you're like, gee, I wonder if there's\n\n01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.040\na secret door there, because it's like, you know, it's going to move.\n\n01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.120\nSo it's like different color, different, just slightly different shade, because it's\n\n01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.120\nlike through the...\n\n01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.120\nDid I tell you guys I was...\n\n01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.760\nI drove with an Uber driver who was like a he-man, the second biggest collector of\n\n01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.920\nhe-man cells.\n\n01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:06.920\nThe second biggest?\n\n01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:07.920\nSecond biggest.\n\n01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.400\nI love that he knew he was the second.\n\n01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.400\nI was like, who's the first?\n\n01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.400\nAnd he knew his name.\n\n01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.400\nAnd I was like, are you...\n\n01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.400\nWas he angry?\n\n01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.400\nYeah.\n\n01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.400\nI was like, are you guys enemies?\n\n01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.400\nHe's like, no, no, we are.\n\n01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:19.600\nI was like, he's like your cringer or whatever.\n\n01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:24.760\nSo anyways, I didn't know until we did Rick and Morty that you have to pick the number\n\n01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.880\nof fingers when you do a...\n\n01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:33.040\nYou know, Justin, I had to sit down and Justin's like, okay, it's time for the finger conversation.\n\n01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.160\nHow many fingers are human beings going to have?\n\n01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.720\nAnd the thing was like, well, fucking five, motherfucker.\n\n01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:44.800\nAnd he's like, well, take it easy there, cowboy.\n\n01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.720\nFive fingers runs into money.\n\n01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:51.160\nLike the Simpsons have four fingers, don't they?\n\n01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.160\nAnyway, it's weird.\n\n01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:57.200\nIt's like 25% more fingers you have to draw.\n\n01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.200\nIt adds up.\n\n01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.800\nI mean, this budgetary minded stuff.\n\n01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.800\nYeah.\n\n01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:02.800\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:03.800\nYeah, I'm not...\n\n01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.320\nGarfield has four.\n\n01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:10.560\nSpencer, have you played Shadowrun before?\n\n01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.560\nNo.\n\n01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:16.360\nWhat are your impressions off the bat of Shadowrun?\n\n01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.560\nIt's a great system.\n\n01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.560\nYou don't believe that.\n\n01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.440\nI believe that.\n\n01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:27.520\nThe Shadowrun universe is...\n\n01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.560\nIt sure is, Dan.\n\n01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:34.320\nWe'll be right back.\n\n01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.840\nSquarespace, it helps you make your own website.\n\n01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:43.400\nI'm here to talk about Bonobos.\n\n01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:47.440\nIt takes place in the dark future of mankind.\n\n01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.000\nCorporations have taken over the government.\n\n01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000\nMega corporations, Dan.\n\n01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.080\nImagine that.\n\n01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:58.360\nBut in addition to that, in addition to all that far-flowing future business where there's\n\n01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:03.560\nall the hacking and the laser swords and the implants and the bionic things, there has\n\n01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:09.120\nbeen an awakening, an awakening has happened along the way, in addition to the world going\n\n01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:15.440\nto shit just for regular conventional reasons, there was an awakening where magic returned.\n\n01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:20.640\nPeople started deforming, turning into trolls and elves and goblins and orcs and things.\n\n01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.560\nAnd there's dragons and stuff that are, did I read correctly that there's a dragon that\n\n01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.560\ngave an interview?\n\n01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:31.440\nYeah, that was Dunkels on, I think, from pronouncing that right, Dunkels on.\n\n01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.440\nHe became the first dragon president.\n\n01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.120\nMy mom's made a name.\n\n01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.120\nIt's true.\n\n01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.120\nIt's Dunkel.\n\n01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.120\nIt's a good name.\n\n01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.120\nNo.\n\n01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.120\nZahn means son.\n\n01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:45.640\nNow, before we embark on this, are we saying goodbye to our D&D campaign for Dunkels?\n\n01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:46.640\nDon't say goodbye.\n\n01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:47.640\nI'm glad you asked.\n\n01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:48.640\nSay good journey.\n\n01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:49.640\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:50.640\nOh.\n\n01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.640\nI know.\n\n01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.800\nWhat does good journey mean, Dan?\n\n01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.800\nJust a reference to the Dolph Lunger and He-Man movie from...\n\n01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.800\nIt doesn't.\n\n01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:00.800\nOkay.\n\n01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:06.080\nDan's the third biggest collector of He-Man.\n\n01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.080\nIt's great.\n\n01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:14.920\nIf you actually look at a bird's eye map of Castle Grayskull, it's identical to Dealey\n\n01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:15.920\nPlaza.\n\n01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.920\nYeah.\n\n01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:24.800\nSo, that's a great question, Jeff.\n\n01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.800\nI'm glad you asked.\n\n01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:26.800\nThanks, President.\n\n01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:27.800\nI don't really know the answer to that.\n\n01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:29.080\nI feel like it's easy enough to put out.\n\n01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:32.760\nI mean, we don't have to set our D&D stuff on fire.\n\n01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.480\nThat story's not done, obviously.\n\n01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.720\nYou don't know how I DM, then.\n\n01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:37.720\nOh.\n\n01:13:37.720 -->

happened oh it happened like early oh 94 someone knows it and why\n\n01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:57.720\nwhy was it notable it was just like a bit like a highly publicized like true\n\n01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:02.680\ncrime I read like six or seven stories about crazy mishaps involving penis\n\n01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:07.560\nseverings I mean I was in a mishap and we were she followed through sounds like\n\n01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:13.240\na mishap I heard about a woman I don't know where I heard this maybe this is a\n\n01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.400\nthing everyone knows about or maybe something that just happened if someone\n\n01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:20.240\nthat I like a friend of a friend some a guy the woman didn't like him she was\n\n01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:26.360\nmad at him and she superglued his dick to his stomach I think I think that was\n\n01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:32.560\ndialogue from reservoir dogs that's what you're thinking of I don't know that\n\n01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:36.680\nHarvey Keitel told sorry I well it's that's pretty interesting concept though\n\n01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.520\nthat you could stand that you can pick a random thing or not a random thing a\n\n01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:43.280\nvery decided thing because that's the thing you're looking for that there's a\n\n01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:50.080\nthere there's a there's a momentum to pop cultural zeitgeist and the John Wayne\n\n01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:55.920\nbobbitt thing like the foam of that surf like stops just before the toes of\n\n01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:00.480\nsomeone at a certain age I think that's very do you know about Nancy Kerrigan\n\n01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:05.400\nand Tony Hardin let me tell you about Nancy Kerrigan wait was that figure\n\n01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:11.840\nskating yeah yeah I my roommate watched a documentary about that that I was\n\n01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:15.920\nlistening to it's back in the news but how do you heard about it before the\n\n01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:20.480\ndocumentary thing when I when I heard the incident I was like oh shit this was\n\n01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:25.280\nbig when I was like seven or something like I definitely heard echoes of it\n\n01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:28.800\nbut yeah I don't I don't really yeah doesn't it seem a little bit like and\n\n01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.160\nmaybe this is an illusion of we're in between them like I remember and the\n\n01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.800\nlast one I can remember is like Octo mom like everyone there's like when there's\n\n01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:39.680\nwhen there's this thing that has no stakes to global society at all but it's\n\n01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:42.520\njust like everyone's talking about it because it's just like when you focus\n\n01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:47.440\nin on it it's it's everyone just wants to talk about Octo mom the the like it\n\n01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:53.360\nseems like we've been we've been in this reverse oasis of our sandbar of like like\n\n01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:58.120\nare those days over because I just be working too hard I mean they're there\n\n01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:02.560\na lot I'm not doing it that I mean they're they're a ton of like true crime\n\n01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.960\nthings that are constantly in the news that Casey Anthony was pretty I don't\n\n01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:11.320\nthink Octo mom's yeah crime thing though well she was like I don't know well\n\n01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:18.160\nshe I guess I mean I mean it does count because it's like relative to what\n\n01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.400\nshould be important to anybody it is one human life and it shouldn't it's like\n\n01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:26.200\nyeah our decision to focus in on it yeah Casey Anthony was a thing I guess\n\n01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.760\nthose just pop up once in a while it just feels like we've been through this\n\n01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:33.680\npatch right now it was just fucking like darkness darkness dark like this river\n\n01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:37.840\nsticks of like like oh there's Bill Cosby's head floating I can recognize\n\n01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:42.200\nthat but like like like everything is just more over just kind of like real\n\n01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:45.720\nlike everything's kind of real right well and I didn't want to imply that the\n\n01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:51.920\nCasey Anthony story was fun no no no it's not fun it's not hard to but but no\n\n01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:57.280\nthere's bigger fish to fry than 350 million people focused on one verdict\n\n01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:01.560\nof one case to be sure so those there's like these things that pop up let's just\n\n01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:05.440\nwonder it seemed like in the but I think that's how you remember time like if I\n\n01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:09.800\nlook back through the 80s I'll remember like all of those things these little\n\n01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:14.280\nmaples that we danced around and I won't remember like the lava flow of\n\n01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:19.520\nactual society stuff just also like turns over so much more quickly that I\n\n01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.960\nused to right now it's just like I did with every with every passing day it's\n\n01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:27.480\nlike I don't know where the tipping points are or where they've been but it\n\n01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:32.440\njust it's like it seems like I was one of like either they're gonna invent some\n\n01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:38.720\nphrase for it now or you can't even exist as a as an entertainment like kind of\n\n01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:42.200\nperson like you you have to make a decision in your life whether you're\n\n01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.760\ngonna dip a toe in that river or not like you have to have a relationship with\n\n01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:51.920\nit because it's like there's just too much available reality now you can't you\n\n01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:55.840\ncan't like there's there's a camera on everything everything is documented all\n\n01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:01.480\nof the all of the goo is seeping up it's all available to us I could I

01:26:32.600\nall right yeah for each of the 30 steps back to your seat I will I will\n\n01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:36.760\nrecount a the world in pictures\n\n01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:52.680\nthank you Laura thank you thank you she walked so fast it's just a blur of\n\n01:26:52.680 --> 01:27:02.760\nBill Clinton it's all I remember did you say Bill Clinton is 1999 yeah all right\n\n01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:10.280\nsuspender shadow run late on us you guys are great at segues well what we have\n\n01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:16.080\nto talk about is what kind of characters we would like to play yeah so yeah I mean\n\n01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:20.840\nthere's there's a way you guys got to make the characters so in general there's\n\n01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:26.640\nkind of five roles the roles are kind of like classes but they're not really\n\n01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:32.080\nthere's not strictly classes and shadow runs so the first role is the face you\n\n01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:37.720\nknow he's the guy he's like Jeff Davis he knows people and he tells stories and\n\n01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:42.680\nhe talks and you know he's that guy he know you know that's a role yeah it's\n\n01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.480\nwhenever whenever there's a crew of people in a movie in a caper movie they\n\n01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:52.120\ngo to a guy who knows some people he's a face man that's the face yeah yeah\n\n01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:56.280\nbecause because the words the the title of the game shadow run comes from the\n\n01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:01.640\nidea that that in the future there's the corporations control like the world the\n\n01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:04.600\nmega corporations they can have their own armies and they have their own law\n\n01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:09.440\nand the world is kind of a mishmash of craziness and alliances and and stuff\n\n01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:15.040\nand there's and there's these mercenaries that that dwell in the shadows\n\n01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:19.200\nthat can you know if you if you need something done and you can't do it\n\n01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.080\nthrough legitimate channels like the a team you go you go to these people\n\n01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:28.440\nshadow runners face man's an actual character from a team is there a it's\n\n01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:33.960\nall it's like they can I be be a be a barack yeah you can he's a troll is it\n\n01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:39.880\nin in shadow one is a troll yeah make the rules yeah okay so what else you got\n\n01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:46.760\nthe face man you got the troll you know trolls are a race Jeff you said there\n\n01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:50.840\nweren't no races classes yeah there's no classes okay so the classes are what\n\n01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:56.440\nsorry okay there's the face after the face there's what I hate to refer to as\n\n01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:03.320\nthe street samurai that's a simple essentially a guy who owns weapons yeah\n\n01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:06.480\nthey're they're the muscle you know sometimes they got rocket launchers\n\n01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:10.960\nsometimes they just got swords and sticks and shit but they use them for\n\n01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:16.000\ntasks street samurai street samurai so they're fighters with weapons yeah okay\n\n01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nthen you got you got the Decker that's your hacker that's kind of like the the\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.040\nwhole thing about the future is instead of the internet they got the matrix and\n\n01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:30.040\nthe matrix is like this virtual overlaid world so like if I was looking in the\n\n01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:35.560\nmatrix I'd see like a virtual mic stand and like a virtual table and then it\n\n01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:38.880\nwould be all like this is a mic stand made by Sony corp and you know it's all\n\n01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:43.200\nvirtual reality sort of thing and then the Deckers they they hack that shit they\n\n01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:46.960\nhave these little portable computers that can do illegal stuff and they can\n\n01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:52.400\nsteal money and you know do hacking things gotcha like hackers would I don't\n\n01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:59.680\nknow they could disable your cyber eyes or something you know my cyber eyes yeah\n\n01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:04.800\nif you have them that's a make-up car and shatter you can get cyber eyes lots\n\n01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:09.040\nof people have like implants bionic implants yeah okay so we got we got the\n\n01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:13.800\nface the street samurai the Decker the Decker then you got your rigor a rigor\n\n01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:18.760\nis like a hacker but they work with vehicles and machines cuz in this far\n\n01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:22.760\nflung you future people don't really know how to drive everything just kind of\n\n01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:26.040\ndrives automatically using this thing called grid guide which is essentially\n\n01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:34.400\nlike if you had to do what ways told you to so it's just like that and so no one\n\n01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:38.360\nknows how to drive unless you like spent time learning how to drive and then the\n\n01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:41.760\nadvanced people are rigors where they can actually jump into the into the\n\n01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:47.000\ninternet and control vehicles from the inside like like go in and be the vehicle\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.640\nand they also control drones which are robots and stuff so that's the rigor then\n\n01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:56.760\nyou got your magic users which are broken up into your shamans and your\n\n01:30:56.760 --> 01:31:01.320\nsorcerers as well as your adepts and shamans are like you know they they\n\n01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:05.480\npray to spirits and that's where they get their magic and sorcerers they're\n\n01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:09.240\njust wizards and shit and then adepts are like they're like people that are\n\n01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:13.600\nreally good at stuff in a magical way so like if you were if you could punch\n\n01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:17.560\nthrough a wall that would because you're like magically strong but you couldn't\n\n01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:28.040\nlike shoot fireballs and stuff that's five right yep yeah yeah I have some more\n\n01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:33.680\nquestions about the adepts yeah like so so are you a certain kind of adept would\n\n01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:37.920\nyou be like I am like a muscly adept that punches through walls yeah like there\n\n01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:41.600\ncould be an adept who's like a master with the swordsman so like if you think\n\n01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:45.160\nof a swordsman who could like slice a grasshopper in half with eyes closed\n\n01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:49.320\nthat would be like an almost magical level of skill or if someone could like\n\n01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:54.160\nbe so good at card games or shooting guns or something that it really you know\n\n01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:58.200\nis it like shape-shifting without shape-shifting are you like absorb like you\n\n01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:06.760\nget to absorb it's like it's like Neo in the matrix I would say I tried Adam I\n\n01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:19.720\ntried I got one I tried to help you anyway yeah no adepts like adepts are\n\n01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:24.480\nlike there's a guy you know he's maybe an assassin and he's got magical abilities\n\n01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:29.720\nthat augment his assassin ship okay but maybe there's a better because the the\n\n01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:40.240\nthe like the the there's probably a permutation of of the class system that\n\n01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:45.240\nallows for just about any kind of character you would want to be so it\n\n01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:50.320\nkind of begs the question like what you know yeah so knowing what little I've\n\n01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:54.280\ntold you about the setting if you had a character concept that'd be a great\n\n01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:59.960\nplace to start so like if I was if I was in the world of shadow run I'd be like\n\n01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:06.520\nthe well-mannered nerd who knows enough but not enough to save his own ass or you\n\n01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:13.400\nknow like something like that you start yeah you start with like a tagline as\n\n01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:19.160\nyour character concept yeah you know\n\n01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:26.920\nthat's a character concept I wish you're a big fan of that movie Lucy I\n\n01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:32.600\nremember that's my favorite movie ever the movies though the dumbest piece of\n\n01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:41.780\nwhatever but so exhilarating but ten minutes before the end of that movie\n\n01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:46.280\nAaron said god damn it why does this movie have to be ending I don't know\n\n01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:50.360\nthe last time that I felt that you wanted Scarlett Johansson to keep turning\n\n01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:55.040\ninto I just want to start improvising yeah I like her go through the ground and\n\n01:33:55.040 --> 01:34:00.040\nthen the earth she starts juggling the solar system and then eating it and then\n\n01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:07.760\nquickly in that movie like they make the big deal in that movie which is like\n\n01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:15.360\nAsian guys with guns like a totally no-stakes deal like it's about 20% of\n\n01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:19.760\nher brain she can just make everyone in the world fall down right and then like\n\n01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:23.520\nfor another hour and a half after that it's like now what's she gonna do and\n\n01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:28.400\ncan she you can always make everyone fall down that thing you do where you\n\n01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:34.080\njust kill the planet and then teleport about Aaron is saying is this movie\n\n01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:39.320\ngonna end with her like taking the Sun out of the sky and throwing it at a\n\n01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:51.920\nguy's Lucy you should check it out so the job of these shadow runners is like\n\n01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:56.320\nthey're kind of like guns for hire though the people that like yeah they do\n\n01:34:56.320 --> 01:35:00.200\nillegal stuff the whole thing is okay there is this incident that happened\n\n01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:04.640\nwhere the Native Americans they formed their own state and they stole nuclear\n\n01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:09.200\nwarheads and they're holding the whole world hostage and as a kind of a result\n\n01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:15.400\nof that get Spencer really soon really quick when Spencer sent this email today\n\n01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:18.400\nexplaining all of this and then I had some questions about like the attitudes\n\n01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:21.720\ntowards the other races and in the email you see you said well you know like\n\n01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:26.760\neverybody hates Native Americans and I thought that is not you that is not the\n\n01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:30.600\nday that like your understanding of the world is that everyone it's Native\n\n01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:33.800\nAmericans and I was like holy shit and I would just like let it go but this is\n\n01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:37.800\nit within the world that is not the diction I use I feel like Native\n\n01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:41.600\nAmericans have been getting a free ride in this country for too long no that's\n\n01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.880\nnot that's not what he no he didn't say anything about I thought I think use\n\n01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:51.560\nthose words exactly no no no everyone in the world of shadow run is racist\n\n01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:55.800\nagainst Indians because you know they they they took the world hostage with\n\n01:35:55.800 --> 01:36:01.520\nnuclear weapons okay and what like terrorists I'm not familiar with that\n\n01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:05.680\nand did that resolve to the yeah you know they shot missiles but the missiles\n\n01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:10.440\ndidn't didn't didn't get to where they were going no one knows why oh so then\n\n01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:15.680\nas a result of that the the governments of the various nations were like shit\n\n01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:20.520\nman you companies you need to be able to protect yourselves and so they started\n\n01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:24.200\nhiring private armies and then they got this thing called extra territorial\n\n01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:28.360\nstatus which basically meant that corporations set the rules instead of\n\n01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:31.840\nthe governments and then they formed their own government called the corporate\n\n01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:36.560\ncourt so as of that all the corporations started rewriting the rules and\n\n01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:40.360\nstarted getting all the money and start making everyone kind of into this you\n\n01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:46.360\nknow these dystopian wage slaves so when everyone is is kind of just slaves to\n\n01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:51.080\ncorporations and corporations only have to play by the rules that they set when\n\n01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:54.600\nthey don't want to play within those rules they hire shadow runs or shadow\n\n01:36:54.600 --> 01:37:02.920\nrunners to do stuff like murder politicians or steel hi-tech shoes those\n\n01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:06.320\nare gonna be your first two missions\n\n01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:12.320\nyeah like a shadow run is one of these covert operations and shadow runners are\n\n01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:17.840\nbasically mercenaries yeah so yeah so we have a jacuzzi we're like we moonlight\n\n01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:21.600\nas shadow runners well in this the thing is in the world you need this thing\n\n01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:25.040\ncalled an sion that's essentially like a credit card number that everyone has\n\n01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:27.760\nwell it's like a credit card in the social security number it's what the\n\n01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:31.400\ngovernments used to track you but shadow runners don't have those so they can\n\n01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:35.160\nkind of live outside of the world or outside the law but as a result they\n\n01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:38.520\ncan't actually have jobs in the normal way so the only way they make their\n\n01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:42.880\nliving is with crime and with doing these runs if you got you're outed as a\n\n01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:47.800\nshadow and are you imprisoned like is it illegal to be one it is illegal to be one\n\n01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:50.920\nbut that's why they always use false IDs so you'll probably be running with three\n\n01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:54.400\nor four false IDs so if someone's like oh that's Kyle Robertson where you're\n\n01:37:54.400 --> 01:38:02.000\nlike I'm James Jamerson now it is illegal but they they have ways around it\n\n01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.520\noh you know who would be helpful in this is DeMorge Brown is DeMorge Brown here\n\n01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:15.280\nDeMorge? DeMorge are you here? There is a really big DeMorge Brown fan over there\n\n01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:20.760\nhopefully not too big I thought if we're gonna if we're gonna make character\n\n01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:26.080\nare you gonna be here next week you don't have to I'm scrolling through my\n\n01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:30.400\nschedule right now it doesn't yes I just wanted to get some get some get the\n\n01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:33.400\npudding stirred here a little bit we're making we're making we're making\n\n01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:36.000\ncharacters now do we have to decide right now or should we should we sleep on\n\n01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.640\nthis and go home should I do some more research and think about this more or\n\n01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:44.760\nshould I fire from the hip and pick a character I mean I don't care for the\n\n01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:48.840\npresentation of it maybe we should come up with character ideas and then if you\n\n01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:53.160\nchange your mind we could go from there just for the audience like what you're\n\n01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:59.080\nsaying when you're describing those five roles what you mean by that is is like\n\n01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:03.720\nthat those are kind of skill sets in order for there to be a successful like\n\n01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:08.480\nkind of typical mission like you kind of want those points covered or at least\n\n01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:13.080\na couple of right so so what does the face man again like what he's the guy\n\n01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:18.240\nthat you go to for what he just knows people so if it's all if it's like oh\n\n01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:25.840\nI need to be smuggled into the sewers of Borneo yeah he has a cake box maybe he\n\n01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:30.240\nknows maybe he has a guy who's high up in the business so if you need to get\n\n01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:35.080\nsome business intel he knows what's going on at the Shiawase Corp for instance\n\n01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:41.080\nso he's like Huggy Bear and Starsky and Hutch thank you DeMorge he's like that\n\n01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:46.240\nthing that he said DeMorge your hair has become tremendous as well yeah you have\n\n01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:51.440\nthe Dan Harmon beard of hair right I think it's all it's just letting it fly\n\n01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:56.600\nman it's good stuff is it easy to maintain how is that I just let it sit\n\n01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:02.780\nthere when it needs to be reordered I pull it all out and it curls back in on\n\n01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:07.600\nitself over the course of a month I like it yeah I mean obviously I'm gonna be\n\n01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:12.560\nthe face man of the group that's that's obvious that's obvious I thought that\n\n01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.040\nwould you know I've never I've never been a magic user so I'm tempted to be a\n\n01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:20.240\nmagic user because I've never done it all right so do you want to be a shaman\n\n01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:24.280\nor a sorcerer shaman's kind of they revere spirits whereas sorcerers are\n\n01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:32.080\nlike this is a science to use magic the function who wants me to be a shaman who\n\n01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:41.360\nwants me to be a sorcerer I'll be a rigor who I'm a sorcerer Spencer I'm a\n\n01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:45.360\nsorcerer all right so what who's confused about the vehemence of the\n\n01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:51.760\nopinions oh nobody nobody okay but also there's race so there's dwarf and\n\n01:40:51.760 --> 01:41:02.480\nhuman I want to be a black sorcerer okay or a dirty Irish potato sorcerer I mean\n\n01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:12.800\nso there's human and or control and elf and dwarf who's black too I imagine an\n\n01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:16.960\nelf sorcerer be pretty good at being a sorcerer right who wants me to be an\n\n01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:28.680\nelf sorcerer who has no opinion I'm a Decker we should Spencer could you as a\n\n01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:33.520\nas a GM could you give some advice on like what would be what would make us\n\n01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:41.160\nhappiest as individuals when choosing what we are like should we are you saying\n\n01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:47.680\nwhat character would you like to kill off less quickly than your other character\n\n01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:52.080\nwhat like should we be choosing characters that fit I don't know like\n\n01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:56.080\nyour opinion obviously there's not like right or wrong I mean if you think\n\n01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:01.080\nabout a character in like a TV show it's like that could be summed up in like a\n\n01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:05.760\nthing and then a character like that might be appealing to you so it's like oh\n\n01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:10.880\nshe's the bubbly the girl next door like that could be like a kind of concept so\n\n01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:15.080\nwhatever appeals to you as a concept of a character you might want to play even\n\n01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:18.800\nindependent of abilities and stuff that's what I have an opinion about\n\n01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:22.680\nwhether people are most I mean like because there's two philosophies one is\n\n01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:26.240\nyou play a person who like you could never be in real life and then the other\n\n01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:30.600\nis to like kind of play a mythologized version of what you are in real life yeah\n\n01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:35.080\nand they're both valid like for role-playing but like do you do you\n\n01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:45.280\nwhat what do you do when you play I play as little girls man yeah perfect\n\n01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:57.080\ntoo soon no I play as I play as a character I exclusively play as\n\n01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:06.080\ncharacters that are skinny well okay so do you play they can jump higher do you\n\n01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:10.440\nplay is but I mean like as far as personality goes do your characters\n\n01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:14.360\ntend to be more like what you want to be or what you aren't or what you dare not\n\n01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:21.440\nbe let me utilize intelligence you know like yeah nobody mean as far as the your\n\n01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:27.560\nrelationship to that character what kind would it what should I do I'm gonna\n\n01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:31.240\nmake a decision for myself right now only because I think this will be fun I\n\n01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:36.600\nwant to be a 15 year old girl who is an elf sorcerer all right yeah I want to\n\n01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:42.360\nbe like I got like a like a young high school girl like age well Erin like a\n\n01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:53.880\ndoesn't franchise just like disaffected like a little punk rock chick when we're\n\n01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:58.600\nplaying I mean what do you tend to find yourself doing you know like you you\n\n01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:05.400\nyou you certainly craft a lot of things like you you like to find yeah well I'm\n\n01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:18.480\nI'm I'm torn Adam what yeah I was kind of thinking that like see like taking the\n\n01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:22.600\nexisting world I would agree with that like like like oh can I make that car\n\n01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:29.480\ndo this or yeah okay cool well I mean I mean part of me really wants to play\n\n01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:32.640\nlike so it was like something that I'm not that I would really like to be like\n\n01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:41.080\nlike a really short strong immigrant man I did not expect that to get a laugh I\n\n01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:45.000\nfeel like that's obvious it like deep down inside it's just funny how\n\n01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:51.800\nconvicted you are a lot of phrases that are funny when you just say them but\n\n01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:55.400\nthen obviously like I really like crafting things and coming up with\n\n01:44:55.400 --> 01:45:00.240\ndifferent maybe you should start with a name first what country what country\n\n01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:06.160\ndo you emigrate from oh just like emigrate from an Eastern European\n\n01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:10.440\ncountry well good news most of the Eastern European countries have been\n\n01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:16.760\nburied by radioactive sludge so there's great reason to emigrate from them\n\n01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:24.000\nemigrate is a 21st century form of immigration are you you send yourself to\n\n01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:30.320\na computer what I think I like within the game the things that I enjoy the most\n\n01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:37.440\nare like my character like pretending to be something or trying to talk to people\n\n01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:42.400\nI guess I don't know I just like talking to people about how they feel that could\n\n01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:47.760\nbe which that could be like the the face man you know you'll you'll stroll up to\n\n01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:53.640\nthe security guard and be all like hey man I'm here on an inspection and then\n\n01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:56.880\nyou'll roll some dice and maybe he'll believe it so it's always my favorite\n\n01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:04.920\npart of the adventure is when Aaron is in charge of go ahead Aaron go talk to\n\n01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:09.840\nthe guy okay yeah yeah all right so you just yeah I mean well that yeah that\n\n01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:15.240\nwould probably be a disaster everyone would be really mad I hey entertainment\n\n01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:23.000\nis a disaster it's what you enjoy okay well I enjoy I like talking to the\n\n01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:29.800\nother characters I also like magic can I be a magic face yeah I mean they're like\n\n01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:34.640\nwe were talking about adept there's like an adept face might be like a guy who or\n\n01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:39.680\na girl who's like so charismatic and beautiful that it's beyond you know the\n\n01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:51.040\nnormal world I think we have a way that's a yes that is a yes I mean like\n\n01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:56.440\npeople are like I mean how did that happen I mean look at that face yes yes\n\n01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:08.120\nI would yeah yes I would like that I yes okay okay what do you want to be\n\n01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:13.480\nyeah I'm well I'm just gonna go I'll just go with my my old like when I played\n\n01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:17.680\nshadow run the first time like I you know if his name is Jim Nightblade that's\n\n01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:24.520\nfine like I like us I guess he'd be a street samurai category because it just\n\n01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:27.920\nit's just more like an assassin yeah you probably just have a lot of gear and\n\n01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:34.720\nstuff yeah like a like like specialty in stealth and like kill you know killing\n\n01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:43.320\nkilling yeah yeah quiet five o'clock shadow very very sexy obviously but yeah\n\n01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:48.200\nI'm not totally unintentionally yeah I'm not gonna physically describe them you'll\n\n01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:56.160\nyou'll you'll get there like kind of ripped and you have you have like old\n\n01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:04.080\ndoodles of Jim Nightblade in your journal yeah that is a promise if I find a\n\n01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:15.320\ndude all very yeah world world weary design right down in any of those\n\n01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:19.960\nthings that'll be like your duty to bring to the character you know yeah I'm\n\n01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:26.560\njust gonna write down like six four thirteen you know numbers and shit what's\n\n01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:38.040\nwhat's left to Marge it's you can't be black oh can I be would I be is there\n\n01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:44.160\nsome sort of cross between a street samurai and then almost like a hajira\n\n01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:50.440\ngrab like a person that move read can read a mood can shift with the mood as a\n\n01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:54.880\nsituation changes what can sense a mood change in the situation before it gets\n\n01:48:54.880 --> 01:49:04.880\nthere like he's highly perceptive yes if there was a if we were going from a to\n\n01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:07.480\nbe an in-between that there were several different types of people to\n\n01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:11.800\nencounter or maybe is there somebody would be like since they can't have\n\n01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:25.920\njobs that they would have we said you can't be black I'm not even I don't\n\n01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:30.240\nget it standing perfectly stills for the people who can't read this at home\n\n01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:35.840\nI'm okay sir you know characters in that world sometimes there they have these\n\n01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:41.200\nunderground jobs like they're the greeter at a hotel or they're a greeter at a\n\n01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:45.080\nlike a casino it's an underground casino or something but they have all this\n\n01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:50.440\nother information so for people in that world they have one face for people in\n\n01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:55.960\nthe know they do something completely different and they always have this sort\n\n01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:01.000\nof broad personality for the people in the regular road so hello hi away that\n\n01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000\nkind of thing and then out there out of the other side of their mouth they're\n\n01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.480\nwhispering vital information people are doing something else is that so they're\n\n01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:13.960\nlike well read I don't at the street level maybe\n\n01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:19.200\nI mean a charisma thing or well I mean it sounds what about a street samurai\n\n01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:25.200\nthat could that can kind of convince other people that can change form in\n\n01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:32.360\nfront of other people change like the newspaper guy from men in black\n\n01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:39.480\nI'm a street samurai yeah yeah I mean what you're yeah that's a thing\n\n01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:45.560\ndefinitely it sounds like what you're describing is just a guy who has this\n\n01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:50.760\nlike a precog that can walk around like a what like a precog that can walk around\n\n01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:56.400\noh I don't know if there's anything like that quite there's not really psychic\n\n01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:02.200\nability so much as magic okay sorry so just a street samurai that's all right\n\n01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:08.760\nI'll be in every man we got to figure out your guys is racist what race do you\n\n01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:19.400\nwant to be DeMorge I want to be Norwegian and my name is horde guard so\n\n01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:26.000\nlike there's humans and dwarves and elves and then there's orcs and there's\n\n01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:31.480\ntrolls and any one of those can be from Norway\n\n01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:46.960\nthe second one dwarves I'm a dwarf okay a Norwegian dwarf I once had\n\n01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:55.760\nhe's an L dwarfling what about Dan and Aaron

you're like how did they take that picture but\n\n01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:35.360\nit's a human it doesn't actually look like the guy but your relationship with\n\n01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:47.640\nit is like it's like you're looking at the heavens I'd like to be human all\n\n01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:53.120\nright and I'm gonna be a 15 year old girl named Juno who's an elf sorcerer\n\n01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:59.640\nall right I think we got got got everything settled then yeah all right\n\n01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:04.840\nthat's good so do we have a show next week my character where my character\n\n01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:14.760\nwears converse is there yeah there is a show next week oh my god\n\n01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:18.840\nthat fuck good could put no I guess there's not a show to say yeah we're\n\n01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:22.000\ngetting a rocky start coming back from the new year so there's no show next\n\n01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:28.680\nweek but then there's one one the one the week after that how about that for\n\n01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:33.880\nfor so what what do we have to do between now and the next show Spencer in\n\n01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:36.920\nterms of character do you have to roll stats and stuff like that no I'll take\n\n01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:40.440\ncare of all that just think about the characters you want to create and their\n\n01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:45.440\nbackgrounds and what they their interests might be you know stuff like that now\n\n01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:49.520\nyou're like a super magic guy so you probably don't want a lot of like robot\n\n01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:55.520\nparts girl yeah girl but the rest of you the rest of you guys think about maybe\n\n01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:59.920\nalso what kind of robot parts you want like maybe if you have to have a metal\n\n01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:04.800\nspleen no no you don't what is that based like what how are we making that\n\n01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:08.160\ndecisions why would we want a metal because it's the future man you can\n\n01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:11.760\nhave laser eyes and shit and I don't know it's that's part of it if you want to\n\n01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:18.240\nhave a robot arm that has like a like a laser eye in it if you want like an eye\n\n01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:23.520\nthat shoots laser drinking fountain and your thumb I can't I can't be robotic\n\n01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:30.440\nbecause I'm a magic user yeah fucks up your magics good yeah yeah I love this\n\n01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:35.280\nso think about those things and I'll all work on making the characters you know\n\n01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:42.360\nbackgrounds your histories what what you do on Thursday evenings stuff like\n\n01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:46.840\nthat I eat Lincoln berries what what is what is what does Jim nightblade do on\n\n01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:53.040\na Thursday evening just like he just looks out at the futuristic cityscape\n\n01:54:53.040 --> 01:55:08.280\nand wonders how it got to this over over a vial of blue liquid are we are we\n\n01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:11.440\nreturning in two weeks with a presentation or poetry about our\n\n01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:17.760\ncharacters are you have to write up to me yeah that would be great like like\n\n01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:21.280\nlike we should we should do like old-school like like like mazes and\n\n01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:29.440\nmonsters you have to like introduce your character I am Haryana of the yeah I\n\n01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:34.480\ndon't know we'll figure it out we'll do a minute presentation any medium we would\n\n01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:40.840\nwe would like except PowerPoint except PowerPoint I also feel like structurally\n\n01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:52.240\nI hate PowerPoint we so is the gameplay the same as a D&D like I mean for you\n\n01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:58.760\nguys it probably will be yeah yeah it'll be pretty familiar I would like on our\n\n01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:03.920\nside I will take the step toward like improving things by I'm gonna I think\n\n01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:09.800\nwe'll try to do is move the gameplay session into the middle of the show so\n\n01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:13.800\nthat we're not always like riproar and drunk and it's not like the thing that\n\n01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:18.400\nwe'll save for the end it's like it's like a thing we do at the goddess point\n\n01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:23.600\nof the story and not the not the end so that we can yeah I don't know just the\n\n01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:27.120\nthought all right that way that way it'll maybe we'll get a little it'll have a\n\n01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:31.520\nlittle more consistency I'm always so fucking drunk by the by the time we\n\n01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:37.080\nplay D&D like I never remember anything Dan would it would it be okay if we did\n\n01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:42.520\nand when I say we I mean me would it would it be okay if I if we because I\n\n01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:46.280\ndon't want to speak for everybody but like if we did maybe have a presentation\n\n01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:53.240\nin two weeks of our characters would that be okay that's fine and also it's a\n\n01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:59.080\nvisual medium now so any any incentive to yeah if you have a hat or something\n\n01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:04.920\nthat that you play the character then that's that's all the more reason to I\n\n01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:13.720\nsee Jane is here Brad earth shine and I'm glad I didn't I've been drinking
