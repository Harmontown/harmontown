00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Welcome to Meltdown Commons in Hollywood, California.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
Happy New Year, 2015. We're in Back to the Future's version of the future.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Are we all wearing metal hats and things like that?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Yeah, we've got little LEDs.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
You have to choose whether you're a lobo, a squeam squab, or a zip-head.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
What's the...

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
You're a tranq, a lobo.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Wait, do you actually know what's the...

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Lowres, Bojo, and Flapjack? What are the three?

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
That's Back to the Future 2, anyway.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
YouTube recommend...

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
I recommend YouTube. It's amazing.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
It's videos just direct to your computer.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
The next time you're like, oh boy, I got nothing to do.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
I got nothing to think about. My world isn't dark enough.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
This will actually lighten it up.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
There's these videos. Schrab sent me.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
There's this guy. This is my new fascination is the people who are exposing things,

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
like the Illuminati things, the patterns that they see in stuff.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
You've seen the one that's like Angels in the Outfield.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
There's a guy who's proving that Angels in the Outfield is like a pedophile.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
It's like a pedophile spell that it's casting on you.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
And it just keeps like freeze, right?

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
He's going, look where his eyes are looking, right at the little boy's dick.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
The Back to the Future one is like fucking amazing.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
There's this guy who's just like...

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
And he throws everything at it.

02:10.000 --> 02:23.000
First of all, he sees every moon landing JFK and 9-11 in Back to the Future.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Like he literally says at one point in his video,

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
the movie is crawling with 9-11s as he's pointing them out.

02:34.000 --> 02:44.000
There is a point, for example, when the DeLorean finally goes back to the future and leaves the trail of 11,

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
as it heads for the movie theater, and the camera pans back,

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
and there is a fucking god damn if there isn't a god damn 9.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
It's like some kind of Western themed breakfast place or something with a lasso for a logo,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
and it's like 9-11.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
I'm a convert, but...

03:03.000 --> 03:12.000
The crazy thing about it is that the guy can detect every 9-11 if he sees JFK's head everywhere.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
But he doesn't know that there's a difference between Back to the Future one and two.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
He keeps referring to him as the same movie.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
It's like, no, that's the second one.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
You're in the splash zone here, my friend.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
You're going to get a little bit of...

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
What happens is the vodka has a...

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
My mustache has a wick effect.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
And I take a drink of the vodka capillaries up.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
And so then whenever I have a splosive...

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
A splosive?

03:39.000 --> 03:46.000
The other day, I picked a pack of peppers.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
It's just vodka. It's not even spit. It's just pure vodka.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
It's good for you.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
So if you sit in the right place, you can get fucked up?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah, yeah. Especially him.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Look at him. He's a pretty fresh-faced young man.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
I believe you could get drunk off of a little bit of aerosol vodka.

04:04.000 --> 04:11.000
That's a compliment. You're a very handsome little boy.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
If you want to watch Angels in the Outfield later...

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
Dan, is it me or is your beard achieving greatness?

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
I can actually... I noticed backstage that I can actually grab it with my fist now.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
There's a thing here I can grab.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
A threshold has been crossed with your beard.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
I lost my trimmer at the wedding.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
It's somewhere in the house. I had my beard trimmer.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
I trimmed my beard for the wedding and I haven't trimmed it since.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
So this is...

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
See, it looks trimmed, though.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
It looks like you've manicured a nice gentle-ben kind of beard.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
I haven't.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Anyways, what...

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
YouTube. We're talking about YouTube.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
So, yeah, just check that out.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Just Google YouTube...

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Yahoo! Use Yahoo!

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
Back to the future, 9-11.

05:09.000 --> 05:19.000
The JFK stuff is really interesting because the guy is convinced that the Hill Valley is identical to Dealey Plaza

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
and that Marty McFly is standing where Kennedy was shot

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
when he's looking at the Sports Almanac.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
And in the window where you see the Sports Almanac, you see two different presidents portrayed two-dimensionally,

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
but then you can see a Kennedy head that is three-dimensional,

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
thus proving the point which is that Kennedy is a transcendent, multi-dimensional being

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
and his assassination has something to do with...

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Back to the future.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
And 9-11.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
He's in it again.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
And the guy keeps calling...

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Of course, he's Gaga for the Twin Pines thing.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Of course, he's crazy about the Twin Pines thing.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
He's like, for some reason, now there's one pine.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Motherfucker, watch the movie that you're...

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
It's not a hidden message.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
It's the joke is that the...

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
It's like, why is there now one pine?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
It's a bit.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
That's pine 11.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
That's been our show. Thanks, guys.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Thanks for coming.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I think it's the biggest...

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
That wasn't even funny.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
You guys are a real pushover.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Yeah, they're a hot crowd.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
We got to reward them.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Got to reward them for this heat.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Got to make some popcorn with this.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
So, this is the last week, I think,

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
that the music is going to be just a free-for-all, copyright-wise.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Should I just play Beatles all night, then?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Yeah, yeah.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
But we're asking...

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
If you go to Harmontownmusic.tumblr.com,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
if you're a musician anywhere in the world, really,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
there's already people that are giving us stuff

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
that we can use under a term that they can agree to.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
We'll use people's stuff who let us use their music

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
and we'll be able to give you credit stuff.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
That'll be fun, because I love being able to play whatever I want.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
But I would love to...

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
If it was all Armenian music, that'd be very cool.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Yeah, yeah. Well, it'd be cool, because, yeah,

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
they do a little thing, especially like...

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Stir me up a little hip-hop pudding.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
You little hip-hoppers out there

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
within the sound of my voice, you know,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
you could be really...

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I'm sure that would be a real honor

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
for your beats to be served up alongside my dropped science.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Okay, so SimCity Build It is going on in the news.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
I'm playing it on my iPad,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
and you know how those Sims...

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
You know how the Sims, like, they talk gibberish,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
like SimLanguage, they go, like,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
R-R-R-B-R, you know?

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
There's a guy, every time you click on a guy

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
that's going to sell you something

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
or buy something from you,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
he goes, he goes,

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
Pussy whips. Pussy whips? Yeah. Pussy whips.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Yeah, or lips.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Pussy whips.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Yeah, check it out for yourself.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
It's free to play, so check it out.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
But of course, after a while,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
you might have to buy magic dollars

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
to keep potatoes from taking a year to grow.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Goddamn virus, this style of game.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Terrible.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I was driving here, and I had my iPad plugged in

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
in my car, like, iPod thingy,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
and I forgot someone named Kyle Coberly.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Did anyone know him? Kyle Coberly?

09:13.000 --> 09:27.000
He sent us this.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
That's nice.

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
See, send us cool shit, we'll play it.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
That seems like a little bit of some backdoor shenanigans,

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
like, that guy's a little more into you than me.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Johnny Carson's on the show.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
Now please welcome Edward Anastasia.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
Make man.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Because Davis doesn't even rhyme with anything.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
It's a hard name to rhyme.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Selfie sticks.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Are happening in the news.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
You got back from Paris.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I was at the Eiffel Tower a couple weeks before you,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
and everybody had their goddamn selfies.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Selfies be stickin'.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
People be selfie stickin'.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
You got me, man.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I don't know, man, we're all over Venice.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Did you get the thing when you were in Paris

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
where the people walk up, do you speak English?

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
There were women that walk up to you, do you speak English?

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
I don't talk to women.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
That's a hard line.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
No, it's just people, like panhandlers,

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
but the thing is, you look American, do you speak English?

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
A previous trip to Paris, I think,

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
I encountered somebody came up

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
and thrust a note into my hands

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
that was this long, tragic tale of, like,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
my child is basically like a global,

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
kind of born identity version of,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
I ran out of gas, my kids are in the car,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
but it was much more creepy,

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
like, why do I know where the exits are?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Where's my safety deposit box?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I can't even remember how we responded to it.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
You said, yes, that's happened to you.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Do you remember what it is?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
What's in and out of it?

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
They didn't speak English very well themselves,

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
so they kind of broke an English written down

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
and it looked like a soft story.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Yeah, and you just kind of have to give the note back.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Here's your note back.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
So, selfie sticks.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Selfie sticks are happening.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Do you have one?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
I don't have a selfie stick.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
What's the point of a selfie stick?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
If you don't have a friend to hold your camera?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I don't know.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
The first selfie stick I saw was in Venice,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
and I thought, oh, this must just be something,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
like, maybe it's canal-based.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Maybe there's too many canals here

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
and maybe it's an adaptation, like a gondola, you know?

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Like, you can't take a good selfie.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Too many people lose their phones over the canal, maybe.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
But then it turned out, oh, no, I've just arrived in Europe

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
as the selfie stick has arrived on humanity.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Are these people walking around by themselves

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
with the selfie stick, or are they with other people?

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
I saw a couple, I was walking in Paris behind a couple,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
not even in, like, a touristy place,

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
and I was behind a couple in an empty street

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
and they were walking and holding hands

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
and the man let go of her hand,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
took the selfie stick, extended it,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
and got, like, a tracking, like,

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
like, like, like, like, selfie stick shot of them walking

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
just for a little bit, and then put it,

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
they both, they kept their heads forward

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
while he did it, he got the shot,

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
and then reteles-

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
So they're just, like, the, like, survivor man

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
walking down the road, like, just, like, filming themselves?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
I don't know, yeah, it's just, I guess it's just,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
they feel it's a better shot.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
It's like a little jib for them?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
I don't like it.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Yeah.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I'm again it.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I did, was it worth it, Adam?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Adam, if you had a selfie stick,

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
would that have been easier for you?

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
I would, yeah, if everybody, next week,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
everybody brings selfie sticks and

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
we'll do something with them, I don't know.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
It worked for Ellen.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
All right.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Would you get a selfie stick?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
If you had one, would you use it?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
If I was able, would you, would you get a selfie stick?

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
No, I would not, I don't, I was, I was,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
I was definitely, I had a lot of opportunities

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
to get a selfie stick.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
If somebody, if somebody gifted you one at work,

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
would you, would you, would you,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
ironically carry it around and then use it?

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
No, I would use, I would use it to see

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
what the hubbub's about.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
It just seems like a stick with your camera

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
on the end of it.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Yeah.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
It's stupid.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Ask a stranger, ask a stranger,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
say take a fucking picture of me.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Yeah, well, I mean, maybe that's,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I don't know, you don't know.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
$800 pump.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Yeah, well, whatever he said, it's true, too.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
You both have your points.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Your beard has got me mesmerized.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Your beard is really good.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Also, the gray is coming in nicely.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
You now have a properly gray beard.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
It doesn't matter.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
He's, Liam Neeson is,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
he's,

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Liam Neeson is in Taken 3

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
and he's, he, he,

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
there's a, somebody, somebody sent me a link

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
to a LinkedIn like promotion where he's,

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
he sits him doing his character saying like,

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
oh, my name's Conor McJohnson,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
whatever his character's name is.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Me and my friends have a particular set of skills.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
Skills like enhanced conversation.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
And then they'll cut to like a clip from Taken

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
where they're like meeting people up.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Aerodynamic persuasion

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
and then throwing a guy out a window.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
And then he goes on to say,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
like, do you have a particular set of skills?

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
If you send in your LinkedIn profile,

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
a lucky winner will have me read their resume

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
to their prospective employers explaining

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
their particular set of skills.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
He keeps saying particular set of skills.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
For real?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Yeah.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
It's pretty, it's pretty amazing.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Why don't we try that?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Why don't we get, get on that?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Go ahead.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Yeah.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
That's what you're supposed to do.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Do it.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Get, get, get on LinkedIn and make a profile.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
What is LinkedIn?

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
It's something that everyone outside LA uses.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
I don't understand it at all.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
It's job Facebook.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
It's job Facebook.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Which is as exciting as it sounds.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
It's a resume.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
It's like a, it's like the internet equivalent of

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
while someone's driving by you on a, on a, on a road,

16:20.000 --> 16:26.000
throwing your resume through their back window.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
So that they have it.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
Except unless you're hiring a backseat person,

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
you're going to find it and be annoyed.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
You're going to be like, who put this garbage in my car?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Or my inbox?

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
The cool thing about it is that I'll see every once in a while,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
I'll get a LinkedIn profile, like a LinkedIn request from

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
somebody like, from like 12 years ago that was like a,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
like a bigger shot than me.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
And like now is like sending me their LinkedIn profile.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
That's kind of cool.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
It's, it's, it's like seeing them like, like, like, you know,

17:02.000 --> 17:09.000
selling selfie sticks on a boardwalk or something LinkedIn.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
I'm sure it's, I'm sure LinkedIn is, is great for people that I just,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
I don't understand.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
You know, so it helps you if maybe if you stain glass,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
but you don't like to cut glass and you send your LinkedIn profile

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
out and there's some guy that's like, he only likes cutting glass,

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
but it doesn't know how to stain it.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
I think that's the idea.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Did you enjoy your honeymoon?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Was it fun?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Yeah.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Because you guys run everywhere.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
You guys were in Dublin and Paris and Venice.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Yeah.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I figured out why I love Dublin and Ireland.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
Cause we went to like this Irish storytelling night.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Like it was a very touristy thing.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
Like in this, in this bar, it was like you get a dinner and this lady

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
stood in front of a fireplace and told Irish stories and sang songs and stuff.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
And it was really cool.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
And she explained Irish history and it kind of dawned on me like listening

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
to the stuff, why I fetishize Irish cultures.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
Cause they're, they're a European culture without, they didn't have a renaissance.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
They don't, they don't have, they didn't participate in this rich people bullshit.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Like they're, they're, they're their own little, little thing.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
Like they don't, if you go back in their history, any other like European culture,

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
it's like, if you go to their museums or whatever, there's going to be some

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
like red suspenders at some point, like, or some like fancy pointy shoes

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
or like a windmill hat or something like, like, oh, and then we did this.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
So this is what we're famous for.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
He could do it to do.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Like, like, like, look at us.

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
Like we look like flower people are like, like, like, like we got, we got perfume on our,

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
on our, on our, on our, on our face.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
What country is that?

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
The one I just described.

18:51.000 --> 18:57.000
Like all of them except for Dublin, you know, like I, I, I, all the country of Dublin.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
I thought, I thought, I thought you said city.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
The, the, the, the, they're just, they're just poor potato people.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
They just grew with the potato.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
They just, they're just, they're just dirty little people.

19:10.000 --> 19:17.000
And they, and they had to, they, they, they, they, they.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
I wish, I wish that was inflammatory enough for you to get letters about that.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
No, they don't care because they've been dirty potato people.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
They're fine with that.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
They don't care.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
They, they, they have a great sense of humor.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
They know they're not affected.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
I think, I think everybody cares about you when you call them dirty little people.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
You're wrong.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
I, we, we had our Irish friend, Gremlin, I had here last, last, last a couple of weeks ago.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
That dirty little guy.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Shut up, madam.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
If, if you told him, I, I called Irish people dirty little potato people.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Not on Twitter though, out of context.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Don't.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
But, like, he, he, like, yeah, that's, that about sums it up.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
You said it, you said it in context though.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
You, you called Irish people dirty little potato people.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Yes.

20:04.000 --> 20:10.000
And so they're, they're, all of their songs and poetry and literature and things like

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
they're, they're not, they don't come out of any kind of nobility or anything.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
It's kind of like, it's very nice.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
They didn't really, they didn't really dawn on me until I was, until I was really learning

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
about it over, over mashed potatoes.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
They still love potatoes over there too.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
That their, their, their civilization exploded because of the potato.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
The potato became a thing like that they could do and they, they, they grew, they grew in

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
population quite a bit.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
And then of course there was the potato blight and then like things got real bad for them

20:44.000 --> 20:52.000
and you know, the rest is history.

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
Can you sing a little Irish song for us about it?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
That's, that's what she would do.

20:58.000 --> 21:06.000
She would go like, oh, and there's a, there's a, one of the fairies of, of, of the, of the

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
potato patch was the shin lanan.

21:10.000 --> 21:16.000
The shin lanan was a lovely woman or take the form of a very seductive lady.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
And she would come a call in when the things and blah, blah, blah.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
And then, and then there's a song about her.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
She know you.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
Well, that doesn't sound right.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
She sounded beautiful.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
I bought her CD.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
That's how beautiful she sounded.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I don't even have a CD player.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
I just, I just bought it because I'm like, make more music.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I don't know.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Keep making it.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
There's a, there's a fairy of the potato patch?

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
No, I made that all up.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
There's, no, there's a, that was one of the coolest things about Irish folklore was the,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
the fairy, I don't know, it's the idea of fairies.

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
Like we, we all, you know, have our understanding of fairies, like the tinkerbells and the whatnot.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
They're always, for us, they're always small and they always have insect wings.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
And they have like, you know, like, you know, there's a very specific fairy, like kind of image we get in our head.

22:14.000 --> 22:23.000
But, but, but the word fairy originally just meant it was like, it's just kind of these crazy like magical beings that are kind of one foot in, one foot out.

22:23.000 --> 22:35.000
Like as a, you know, as pre Christian mythology that got a Christianized, but like the way that they Christianized it was to say that when Lucifer,

22:35.000 --> 22:42.000
Lucifer went down from heaven into hell, there were, there were a bunch of angels, you know, who were like totally like hail Lucifer,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
I'm going to go with them right away.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
And then there were like the angels that were like fuck Lucifer, I'm going to stay, stay up here.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
But then there were like the kind of like, I don't know, I'm going to see where the action is.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Kind of wandering downward.

22:55.000 --> 23:01.000
And then there was like an angel that went to God and said, come on, give those guys a break.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Don't, don't make them go all the way to hell.

23:03.000 --> 23:10.000
And then God like snapped his fingers in at the exact moment, you know, when he, when he called, you know, it's like play it where it lays.

23:10.000 --> 23:21.000
So some, some, some angels were like, you know, in the ocean and somewhere in a rock and somewhere like had half of their head in a flower and their foot in a, you know, a pork chop or something.

23:21.000 --> 23:33.000
So, so like that's the kind of fairy you are, you know, like you're the, you're, you're, if you're, if you're going to pork chop for a foot and then like a, like a flower for a hand.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
And then, but it's just like, you know, their fairies are like, they could be monsters.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
They're like Cinnabites.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
They're, they're angels to some and demons to the two others.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
And a leprechaun is one of those.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
A leprechaun is a fairy, Jeff.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Did you know that?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I did not.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
What, what do they call the one that has half a foot in a pork chop?

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
That's, I don't, that's a sin fire.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Did you enjoy Venice Italy?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
How was that for you?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Did you know, did you know a banshee is also a fairy?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
I did not know.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
They're all fairies.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Every, every monster you could name, werewolves or fairies.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
I made that up.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
How was, how was Venice for you?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Do you enjoy that?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Venice was cool.

24:13.000 --> 24:19.000
I got to walk around Venice like by myself on Christmas Eve.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
It was crazy because I didn't even realize until the daylight,

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
like how crowded that city can get in the winter.

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
It's pretty dead, which is why Peter Weller recommended it in his architecture blog,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
which Aaron read.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
The reason we went to Venice is because Aaron read this article by Peter Weller,

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
who is not only Robocop apparently, but is also a PhD in like Renaissance architecture.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
It's a huge history in that, yeah.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
And is arguably like more into like Renaissance architecture than being into Robocop.

24:50.000 --> 24:56.000
I don't, like, but, but like, we were joking about,

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
because in the article he talks about why you should go to Venice in the winter,

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
why it's so beautiful.

25:01.000 --> 25:10.000
And, you know, so Aaron booked all this travel based on this like article that he wrote.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
And we did, we went, we're going to a lot of the places that he recommended

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
and we kept joking like, I will probably run into Peter Weller.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
But so we finished dinner on Christmas, Christmas day.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
Was it, was it Christmas, was it Christmas night?

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
And yeah, finished dinner and went down to get our coats and we're putting on our coats

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
and like this kind of coat room and then in walks Peter Weller.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
No.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Yeah.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
And like, just froze.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
And Aaron looked at me like gave me this look that was like silently communicating like,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
like, should I?

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
And I'm like, yeah, fucking go for it.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
Like, because I'm not going to talk to him like about like,

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I'm not going to go like dead or alive.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
You're coming to Venice.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
Like, all I'm going to talk about is Robocop.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
Talk to him about fucking this bullshit you read him about.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
And she's like, excuse me.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
I'm sorry.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
We, we, we read, we read your article about about Venice in the winter.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
And he's like, no, you're here.

26:11.000 --> 26:18.000
He kind of held his hands out like, and the amazing thing is you have to,

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
you have to understand like Peter Weller like while the beautiful Christmas miracle.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
This is like fucking Peter Weller.

26:25.000 --> 26:32.000
But while he's, while he's talking to us, people are, he's speaking in Italian to these,

26:32.000 --> 26:38.000
you know, people who are putting his winter clothes back on him.

26:38.000 --> 26:46.000
And so as he's speaking to Aaron about Venice, he's becoming this old Italian man because

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
like the cape and the scarf and the hat are going on.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
So it's like, like, like kind of like Robocop kind of came in and it was like,

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
and then it talked to, and then he slowly became like, you know, I don't know,

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
he just started, like, he became like one of those cool old guys that walks through

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
like an Italian city like, like, like at night, like looking at a pocket watch

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
and eating a, eating a panini.

27:08.000 --> 27:14.000
But, but, so, so he just, he just talked to Aaron for like, you know, 15 minutes or so

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
about like, like how cool Venice is and why he wrote that article and

27:18.000 --> 27:24.000
I just, I just sat there and stared like, yeah, that's it.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
That's all, that's, you know, if Aaron's got a different version of that story, but

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
I love that.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
It was pretty, it was pretty amazing.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
It was like, this is a really magical thing.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
Like when you, when you, when something like that happens, you kind of like,

27:35.000 --> 27:40.000
you kind of, you kind of gather, gather it up in a little jar and you kind of like

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
just want to run out like right away, but you make it last as long as you can.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
You try not to, you know, overkill.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
Like when she was kind of like ran around the corner and we're like skipping,

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
going like, he's right behind us.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
He's right behind us, but like, gotta, gotta get somewhere safe so we can like

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
just crack up and like roll around on the cobble, like, like, like freaking out.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
Like how, like, like repeating every, every, every word.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
That's so good.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
He had a purple cashmere scarf.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
It had to be a gift.

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
Like, like, it looked, it looked so odd.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
I think someone gave him a purple cashmere scarf.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
He might have bought it for a dollar.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
He might have bought it for a dollar.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Adam, let's do it.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Wow.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
I'm sad that I got that joke.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Do you ever see the new RoboCop?

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
No.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Yeah, I saw it.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
Did they, did they stick with a new outfit or did they, they redid the outfit?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Did they redo it?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Yeah.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Yeah, and they make a point of redoing it?

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
Like, like, they have a scene where a guy goes like, you should make it black.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
I don't understand what they were doing.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
I don't get it.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
I don't like it.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
I don't like, I don't like it.

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
I did some terrible, terrible movie that never, never was released with Kurt Wood Smith

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
and he was in it, we'd never worked together.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
And he sat in front of me at the screening and it was so bad.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
And I just, I was freaking out because RoboCop, Kurt Wood Smith was in front of me.

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
And at the end he grabs me, I was dead on page 40 and at the end of the movie he grabs me

29:15.000 --> 29:22.000
by my collar, by my tie and pulls me towards me and goes, boy, did they kill you too early.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
I got out where the getting was good.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Cabin Times, what was that called?

29:29.000 --> 29:35.000
It was called Cabin Times.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
Well, it wasn't Cabin Fever because that's a thing, right?

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
It was called...

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
It's something Cabin.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
No, it's not Cabin.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Deadly Cabin.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I wish it was called Deadly Cabin.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
It's called Evil Remains.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Oh, Evil Remains.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
Colin, it's Cabin Time.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
It took place in a cabin.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
There was a cabin for certain.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
I've never seen that one.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Don't.

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
It's a horror movie and I went to the screening of it and Kurt Wood Smith was in front of me

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
and the other actors in the film and they brought a bunch of people into the Lemley Theater

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
like in the Sunset Boulevard thingy, whatever the fuck it is.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
And it's so bad.

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
I think the audience thought it was a comedy and so then they just started laughing to the whole thing.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
But it's not a comedy either.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
But nobody thought it was scary either.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
So it became a comedy and we were just sinking down into our seats.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
And it was really bad.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Really, really, really bad.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
Well, all right, let's see what else we got here.

30:41.000 --> 30:48.000
I ran into a kid in Paris that learned English from watching Community and Sopranos.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
Can you do an impression of what that would be like?

30:51.000 --> 31:03.000
Well, no, I mean, there's no, you know, what do you, like he would say, bada-bada-boom, a pop-pop or, you know.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Met about it.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
Met about it.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
And there was another kid there and he had this, well, whatever.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
No one's interested in that.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
No, I've told it like three times and no one cares.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
There was this other French kid that showed up.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
And he had an app on his phone that he showed me.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
I just thought it was kind of interesting because it's like, I don't know.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
Foreign people, we don't know anything about them.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
What are they doing?

31:32.000 --> 31:44.000
Like how could your show that you write had never having been outside of the country, you know, how could it ever be appealing to like, you know, like people who don't speak the same language when they're in grade school.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Did he watch it in French or in English?

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Well, I think they watch it in English.

31:49.000 --> 31:59.000
Like I said, one of them would watch it with French subtitles on first and then change them to English subtitles and then eventually turn the subtitles off.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
That's something they do there.

32:01.000 --> 32:11.000
They're so steeped in English, like, you know, more so than we are steeped in French, that it's a little, it's a little more natural for them to be able to do that.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
But rest assured, we are a lazy bunch.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I really am.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
I can't, I can't, I can't just, I can't do it.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
Like, I can't, like, like Aaron, Aaron knows definitely more French than me.

32:24.000 --> 32:41.000
But like, also, I think there's this crucial thing where it's like, there's just a shamelessness of like, you have to, you can't, you can't like, you have to like just be willing to speak wrong in order to ever successfully speak to someone who speaks a different language.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
You can't be like this held up by this, like, like, there's just fear that like seizes me.

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
You know, you just end up going like, oh, oh, oh, bonjour.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
Le bacon.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Le bacon.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Le bacon.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Like, like, le bacon.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Good day.

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
The bacon.

33:06.000 --> 33:16.000
But, but Aaron would kind of like slide, you know, slide into the French Uber and just be like, and the driver would be like, huh?

33:16.000 --> 33:29.000
But, but, but then like a couple minutes later, he'd be like, are they both doing a bit or they're like talking to each other about stuff.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
And then Aaron, Aaron got like bronchitis.

33:31.000 --> 33:38.000
She thought she might have pneumonia, so she got up in the middle of the night, she's like coughing up a lung and she got on the phone.

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
And then she's like, I can't do an impression of it because it's like fluent French.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
I know she's like speaking to somebody about getting a doctor.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
Like she called somewhere in Paris, like a regular person trying to get a doctor.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
And it was like, oh, it's just we train a lot.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Like, what the fuck?

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
Jesus Christ, she's speaking French about dying and being sick and stuff.

33:59.000 --> 34:04.000
Because it was like she took out sticks and made a fire.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
And then she puked at very size.

34:07.000 --> 34:14.000
Well, I think we'll let her tell that story.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Yeah, I mean, you know, what else am I going to talk about?

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
Who cares, right?

34:20.000 --> 34:40.000
I want to bring up my honeymoon wife, Erin McGathy.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Did you guys do it French style?

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
You kiss both cheeks?

34:44.000 --> 34:49.000
We didn't.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
I don't know.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
You healthy again?

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
I am.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
Just recently, though, I still have a little thing in my throat.

34:56.000 --> 35:02.000
And today I did it like a Channel 101 pilot and there was an older woman there.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
This actress who was brought in who I don't think knew anybody.

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
And I coughed and like she had done some very nice women,

35:09.000 --> 35:15.000
but she had done some like very like six seeming things earlier that made me kind of worried about her health.

35:15.000 --> 35:20.000
Like there was a fog machine and she said, Oh, is something on fire?

35:20.000 --> 35:26.000
And I said, Oh, no, that's that's a fog machine and it's just it's just vapor.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
And she was like, OK, OK, don't want anything to be on fire.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
And I was like, yeah, no one does great.

35:31.000 --> 35:36.000
But then 10 minutes later, she she looked at me like she was looking through the pizza.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
Also, she was like examining the pizza, which is strange.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
But she had eaten pizza and was just looking seeing all the pizza.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
And then she looked at me and she said, Is something on fire?

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
And I was like, Ha, ha, ha, ha.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
She was like, Is something on fire?

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
No, it's a fog machine.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
It's vapor.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
And she was like, OK.

35:56.000 --> 36:01.000
But then five minutes later, I coughed and she said, You need to get some help.

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
So I guess I'm still a little sick.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Yeah, you know, you don't sound that good.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
Like in bed at night.

36:12.000 --> 36:22.000
Oh, no, we sleep we sleep together.

36:22.000 --> 36:27.000
But we're not always sleeping.

36:27.000 --> 36:33.000
Right, because she keeps coughing.

36:33.000 --> 36:41.000
Well, then why don't you start living?

36:41.000 --> 36:47.000
Yeah, no, I got I was very, very sick and I was very proud of myself for calling the French doctor.

36:47.000 --> 36:54.000
And the French doctor came and gave me prescribed me some antibiotics and they made me violently ill.

36:54.000 --> 37:00.000
And I threw up in Versailles after doing a ton of research and trying to convince him to go.

37:00.000 --> 37:05.000
And it was very self-righteous about how great I am about enjoying historical things.

37:05.000 --> 37:12.000
And I threw up right on history and was ushered out, escorted out while the tour continued.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
And I just slept.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
Oh, I didn't tell you this because I was very ashamed and I thought you'd be embarrassed.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
But when I was escorted out, I was so sick.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
And you know, when you're sick, you want to put your face up against something cold.

37:24.000 --> 37:33.000
And so I was lying in the courtyard of Versailles with my face just on the stone.

37:33.000 --> 37:49.000
Literally like behind the golden gates where we were the sixteenth for summary internet and the people of France looked in wanting to be there.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Because that's what the French Revolution is, right?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
I'm just kidding.

37:53.000 --> 38:01.000
Anyway, I was lying on the ground at Versailles, but put my very fancy coat over me so people didn't think I was homeless and it worked out.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
Homeless people hate insulation.

38:04.000 --> 38:10.000
Well, I was just like, well, I mean, because I definitely looked like there was something wrong, but I was on the inside of the gate.

38:10.000 --> 38:15.000
So I clearly bought a ticket, but people don't usually lie on the ground with their face on the stone or Versailles.

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
So you put your coat over yourself so that people just thought you were a corpse?

38:19.000 --> 38:28.000
Well, I put it over my shoulder and then I had my little guidebook so it looked like I was kind of doing something.

38:28.000 --> 38:38.000
I was very sick. You know, when you position yourself in a sleeping position, when you have to sleep and you want people to think that you're doing it on purpose, it was that kind of thing.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

38:40.000 --> 38:46.000
Well, have you ever tried to fake sleeping in an educational situation?

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
Like, you mean like putting your head down?

38:50.000 --> 39:02.000
Yeah, like in school you're sleeping, you have your hand on your face and just your head down and then a book and you learn how to hold a pen while you're sleeping so it looks like you're doing something.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
I'm just glad you didn't make me go.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
You didn't go?

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
No, I don't.

39:09.000 --> 39:19.000
You said you don't. You're like, why would I want to go to some guy's house?

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000
And the only answer is, oh, this guy was really rich.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
No, I'm not going to have this argument.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
He told everybody what to do.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
Yeah, yeah, that's so stupid.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
So you didn't go?

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
No, I'm not going to go to Versailles.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Also hates Paris.

39:41.000 --> 39:49.000
Why is it so absurd because it's like we cut their heads off, like we hated them.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
We didn't do that.

39:50.000 --> 39:56.000
We being modern people, we turned our back on the idea of all that shitty fucking.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
Yeah, well, I wasn't going because I was like, the way they did the wallpaper.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Yes, shoot.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
That's exactly why people go.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
No, that's not why people go.

40:08.000 --> 40:17.000
I'm walking through and I'm like, oh, this is where the royal court met for the last time when they said,

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
you know, Louis XIV and Marie Antoinette, you have to stay here.

40:21.000 --> 40:26.000
You have to stay hostage because we have this big list of people who are going to be beheaded.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
And there are these moments, so many moments.

40:29.000 --> 40:36.000
And Marie Antoinette is Austrian and she's 14 years old and she's married right away.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
And she goes into her room and she's like, ah, this is this is my life.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
And my life is perfect.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
And my life is or my life is my life is terrible.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Oh, so many dresses and she has no idea what's going on.

40:45.000 --> 40:50.000
And you get to be in these halls or people have been.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
I mean, I care more about that stuff, obviously.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Do you think Peter Weller would have enjoyed that?

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Well, of course.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean.

40:58.000 --> 41:05.000
That's the amazing thing about Peter Weller is he's he's part Dan, part Aaron, all.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
All purple scar.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
He cares about architecture.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
He was Robocop.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
Yeah.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
I mean, it's also it's also magnificent.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
What did you do instead Dan that day?

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
At that.

41:16.000 --> 41:21.000
Well, at that particular time, when she was at Versailles, I found a bar I could drink

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
in in Paris because it was a British themed bar.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
So it was just made to be like a pub.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
I can't like it's hard.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
They don't have like a burgeoning cocktail culture in Paris.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
They do.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I mean, I went to Paris for the first time.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I never I've never spent any time there like alone.

41:38.000 --> 41:43.000
So I went there alone in the first week of December and I had friends there that are

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
these Parisian rock and rollers.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
They're very cool.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
And they kind of showed me around the first night and then it was on my own.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
And I kind of like I kind of failed.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
Like I wasn't like like doing anything cool.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
I was seeing some sites went to went to see the museums and whatnot.

41:57.000 --> 42:02.000
But like I was intimidated by the I don't speak any French except the how do you do

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
this and pleases and thank yous and stuff.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
And I asked my friends like how come girls here just do not look at you?

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
Like as in New York a week before people like flirt with each other.

42:11.000 --> 42:15.000
They make eye contact and they look at you and either have a fuck that guy or that guy's

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
good looking or they don't care.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
In Paris girls are gorgeous.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Everybody's fucking skinny for some reason.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
And they all they're all smoking and nobody makes eye contact.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
And my friend who's from there he goes he's a girl in Paris.

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
If she looks at you one time that means she is very interested in you.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
If she looks at you a second time that means she is going to fuck you.

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
And I said I didn't get the fucking first look yet.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
And then the last day I was there I went to this fancy cake place.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
Like a gâteau something you know like a what do you call it?

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Pâtisserie.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
And really fancy place.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
I found out a way to get French girls to look at you.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Walk around with a really nice box of cake.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
I had a white box of gold lettering and girls just like turning their heads.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
They want to know what's in that fucking box.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
So did you.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
So if they're...

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Oui.

43:13.000 --> 43:18.000
So I went to a club one night and there was on the carpet this place is called Che Castel.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
And the carpet is all dicks, pussies and tits.

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
Ornate carpet if you look at it closely it's all this weird horny thing.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
And down in the basement there's this piano.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
And it was Serge Gainsbourg's old piano where he used to go play it kind of as his second home.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
And there's a cigarette burns from his cigarettes on it.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
I went there one night and there was nobody there.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
On the last night I was there I met these people.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
And they took me...

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
I went to La Peruse this place like right on the scene.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
Which is like from the 1700s and like Victor Hugo used to go there.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
And I just did my old experiment of just going to a place and posting up.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Sitting at one place all night long.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
No one talked to me for two hours.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
And at the end they're like they kick everybody else out but they go you can stay.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
And then at the end they're like...

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
There was a girl there that I loved. She was so beautiful.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
And she actually made eye contact with me.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
And she was like the DJ there.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Or one of the DJs and they took me...

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
They're like you come to this club with us.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I go should I like meet you there?

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
And they go no, you walk with me.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
And we went there and down in the basement.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Where I'd been before.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Now it's filled with people smoky. People playing piano.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Girls start taking their shirts off.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
And guys lighting cigarettes with them.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
They're dancing with their shirts off.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
It was so fucking French I couldn't believe it.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
They're lighting the women on fire?

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
No, no.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
There was a girl. She took her shirt off.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
She's laying on the piano and a guy that she doesn't know.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
There's a picture on my Instagram.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
And this guy is a really good looking guy.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Lights a cigarette and puts it in her mouth.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
And on my Instagram she's like who is that guy?

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
They all took me to this party afterwards.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
Where there was three girls.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
The girl who was one of the DJs.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
And these two guys in this crazy house.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
It was like if MC Escher and Frank Geary

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
made a really gay Parisian house together.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Stairways that went nowhere.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
You have a push on a wall and the whole thing opens up.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
And some floors are glass.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
You can see down to the bathroom.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Or you can see through to that room.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
You can't see into that room.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
You can look from one room into another.

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
And the top floor is one giant bed.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
And I get up there and they go,

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
one of the girls goes, Jeff, you are gay, no?

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
And I said, no.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
I ripped my coat off, ripped my jacket off,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
ripped my tie off.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
And all of them took their fucking shirts off

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
and started making eye with me.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
How is the pastry?

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
Huh?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
And then, so while that's happening,

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
this guy comes up.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
This guy named O'Reilly Austin.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
He comes up and he lays down

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
like 15 feet away from us, lays down sideways

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
and smoking a cigarette.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
And one of the girls in France is like,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
like, O'Reilly Austin, do you want to come and join?

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
And he goes, no.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
And just sat there smoking and digging it.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Wait, he was just...

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
He wanted to watch.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
So a couple nights ago, there's this...

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
I was telling the story to some friends of mine.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
And because our friend from France was showing up,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
his famous hairdresser from Charlie LeMindu,

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
he does like Lady Gaga's hair.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
He's like a super duper famous French hairstylist.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
And he shows up and I just told the story.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
And I said, you know La Peruse?

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
And he goes, yeah, I do a night show once a month.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
I promote the night there.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
I go, oh, I was just telling them about this girl.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
And he goes, was it Amre?

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
I go, yeah.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
And he goes, yeah, she rapes all the men.

46:35.000 --> 46:44.000
It was fucking French.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
And my car came at 8.30.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
It was fucking French.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
They had written all over me.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
I had writing on my arm and on my face and my neck and my shirt.

46:55.000 --> 47:00.000
They kept writing on me like this is the back of the pocket square.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
And I got to the airport and I was just covered in writing.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
And the French guys at the airport seemed to like,

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
that was just another day of the office for them.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
It does get very French in Paris.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
It does.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
It's like these French have got a different word for everything.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
We were there on New Year's Eve and in this,

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
I had some friends that we ran into from New York

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
and we were in this club at like up until 5 a.m.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
And when we walked in there, we were like, oh, cool, cool club.

47:33.000 --> 47:37.000
And it was all red and the music, the music's terrible.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Paris?

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
Well, I mean, I'm sure not, not across the board,

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
but where we were, it was pretty bad.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
It was like a, whatever the, what it's called,

47:46.000 --> 47:53.000
when you type it words into a website and then it gives it back to you.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Translation?

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
Yeah, like a translator, but what you want to say.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
Like a Stephen Hawking, like automated.

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
I know there are many obvious words that I'm forgetting.

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
Anyway, we were in this place where this DJ was typing words into like

48:09.000 --> 48:14.000
some sort of like child's toy or a deaf person's toy

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
and was playing it with like a heavy beat underneath

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
and everyone was really into it.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Except for the deaf people.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
Ironically, even though their life is a game.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
We, we, we,

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
This is the one, the one time.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
I mean, it's a choice.

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
But I, we're at the door and I speak very, I speak very little French,

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
but it was at the door and like spoke enough French to the guy

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
that somehow like we got into this club that was like a private party

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
and everyone's dancing and then everyone's making out

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
and then people are taking people's faces and saying,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
no you make out, no you make out.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
Like we're not a part of this. Like we're very obvious.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
We're just watching all of this happen.

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
But every, everyone is, there's this, just this very free energy

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
and it started when I was like, are we at like a very special free club?

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
But I think it's just like a French thing.

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
But the height of it was when a guy came downstairs who looked like

49:15.000 --> 49:19.000
A jolly old elf.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
And he had this sack full of presents.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
Like when you, when you watch, if you were to watch a 70,

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
a biopic about a very famous hairdresser from the 70s,

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
this would be that guy.

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
He came down wearing a beret, which they, they do.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
They really, well it was crazy.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Like it just seems so on their nose.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
They actually, they do wear berets.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
They wear berets.

49:40.000 --> 49:45.000
I actually, I heard one totally non-Iranic, ooh la la.

49:45.000 --> 49:50.000
I went to McDonald's and they said bon appetit.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
And I was like, ah!

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
They just, they just laughed.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Wait, wait, I have a question.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
Why did you go to a fucking McDonald's in Paris?

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
Oh, well because everything was, was, we, we,

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
we went because the kids that Dan met at that bar were talking about it

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
like it was the most amazing restaurant in the world.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
And we just, I just thought, I thought it was funny.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
I did it.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
The kids call it Macdo.

50:13.000 --> 50:19.000
But anyway, this guy, the guy's wearing, the guy's wearing this beret

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
and he comes down, he comes down into this dance floor.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
And this club, this club is called Bonnie and Clyde

50:26.000 --> 50:30.000
and it's in the Pigalle and it's like the cool like hipster club.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
And the, the bathroom was crazy.

50:34.000 --> 50:40.000
The bathroom was crazy because you like wait in line for the bathroom

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
and you, you get to where like it would split off into like

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
men's or women's or two stalls or three stalls.

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
There's one stall that has a door and then there's like a trough

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
or urinal, but it's like right there.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
So if you're standing in line and a guy just has to pee

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
like he'll stand there and pee.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
But the more shocking thing about this, it became,

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
if you were a man who had to shit, you had to wait for this other thing.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
And I learned very quick, like I learned a lot of French for,

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I, I am so sorry.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
I am going to shit before you.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Anyway, this guy comes down with a parade.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Then you would take someone's butt and go like,

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
now you shit over here and you pee, you pee in his shit.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
No, it was, it was just weird because like, I mean,

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
it was weird for a second.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
But when I say weird, I mean, it was, it was actually like this,

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
this really like neat human moment where it was like,

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
yeah, we're all in this together.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
Like knowing when a man has to shit, but then also the women

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
get to maintain this mystery of like,

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
you don't know what's going to happen in there for me.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
But like for a man, like it's like,

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I poop will be coming out of my butt.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
And that is why I am waiting in this line and

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
poop will come out of my butt before you do whatever mystery

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
you'll do in there.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Anyway, this guy came down.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
You guys had a very different Paris experience than I had.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
This guy had a beret and a cape and came to the middle

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
of the dance floor and a cape, a long cape and,

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
and not, not heels, but men's heels.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
Like when you see pictures of, of like restoration heels,

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
like French restoration heels, like they were clearly men's

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
shoes, but he was wearing heels and just started very

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
sincerely voguing.

52:23.000 --> 52:29.000
And I, I was looking around at every, no, no reaction,

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
no reaction.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
And it was amazing and beautiful.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
And like he saw me looking at him and then was like,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
all right, this is the time when I do this,

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
when I do this for you.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
And I just sat there while this man voked for me.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
While you're waiting to take a shit?

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
No.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
This is in the, yeah.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
This is in the, this is in the dance, the dance room.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
All right.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
All right.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
Well.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Ah, Kelly.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Yeah.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Dan, Dan, thumbs up, thumbs down on Paris.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
What do you, do you like it?

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
I'm not a Paris man, but, you know, I was,

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
I wasn't a New York man for, for several New York visits.

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
And then Dino showed me the, the, the Dino side of New York.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
And now I love New York.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I, someone will have to, you know,

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Paris is very intimidating to me.

53:14.000 --> 53:18.000
It's, it's, it's for, for no, for, I'm absolutely of no,

53:18.000 --> 53:23.000
like, like, I, I don't funnel my fear of Paris into me going,

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
oh, Paris is shitty.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
I think the deal with Paris is,

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
if I could totally make a bunch of sweeping generalizations

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
and speculations is that, like, even though it's a city

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
that everyone on the planet wants to go to,

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
unlike other cities that everyone on the planet

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
wants to go to, they have, they've refused to succumb

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
to the tourist industry.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
They, they're the tourist culture.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Like they all know English, but they,

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
that's where you get that, that, that stereotype of like,

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
well, you have to try speaking French,

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
otherwise they don't like you.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I, I finally got that when I was there.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
It was like, I think I'm putting myself in their shoes.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
It was like, oh, suppose you're, suppose you're Paris

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
and you just want to be New York.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
Like, like people in New York don't bend over backwards

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
for people that don't speak English.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
Yeah.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Like, like, in my experience, like going to Italy,

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
people like throw their arms around you as a stranger

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
and some, and also Paris is not all of France.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
Like South of France is very different than being in Paris,

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
where people, like, it's more provincial and it's less,

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
like, in Paris people are busy.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
They got shit to do.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
And also being an American doesn't charm them.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
That's not enough on its own to be interesting to them.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
They got shit to do.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
I went to go buy a razor because I left my razor in New York

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
and I went to a very busy, like, drug store

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
and I found the razor.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
And I was hoping that I could just walk up,

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
put the razor on the thing.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
She would type it up.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
I would see a number.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
I would overbid on Euros.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
She would give me a lot of change and that would be the end of it.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
And she goes, she rings it up.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
I put the money.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
She goes, I don't know.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
And she's like, why not?

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
In perfect English.

54:59.000 --> 55:03.000
I go, I don't speak French.

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
And she goes, like, why?

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
And I said, one phrase I know.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
I said, j'espère qu'en jeu je parlerai bien en français.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Like, one day I hope I can speak French well.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
And she goes, en jeu?

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
Like, one day.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Like, you're fucking, you're here now.

55:21.000 --> 55:25.000
I go, lady, give me the fucking razor.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
And she fucking died laughing.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
Like, she loved it.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
Like, they'll give you shit.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
You can give them shit back.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I'm like, I had you said I hope

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
I go, one day I'll speak French well.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
And then she was giving me shit back.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
They're not mean.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
They just got shit to do.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
And I think they're quite charming now.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
I think it's a city that people go to

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
to have like fantasies and dreams and things.

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
Like, like, but it's not, like...

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Like Barfing and Versailles.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Like when you go to Venice,

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
every other building is either a hotel or a Paris store.

55:58.000 --> 56:04.960
It's obvious that, like, there's not, obviously tourism is, like, it's infused to the culture.

56:04.960 --> 56:10.640
Like, if you're gonna roll your eyes at the idea that you have visitors, then you're an

56:10.640 --> 56:12.400
idiot as a Venetian, I think.

56:12.400 --> 56:15.400
Like, the die is cast for them.

56:15.400 --> 56:19.400
And for Paris, they're like, look, I understand that you're an awaking dream, because of the

56:19.400 --> 56:25.320
Eiffel Tower's over my shoulder, but I got shit to do, and I'm not being a prick to

56:25.320 --> 56:26.320
you.

56:26.320 --> 56:32.040
Like, when you wander into my bar, and you're kind of like, you know, you're just in a different

56:32.040 --> 56:37.160
mindset as a tourist, you're like, like, oh, like, you're off work, you're not working.

56:37.160 --> 56:42.160
And it's, yeah, whatever, we've beat this horse dead, but it's, I think there's just

56:42.160 --> 56:47.440
cities that make that choice, like, it's a binary thing, almost, they go like, okay,

56:47.440 --> 56:48.440
let's face it.

56:48.440 --> 56:49.440
I think there'll be a trip for you.

56:49.440 --> 56:50.440
People are coming here to visit.

56:50.440 --> 56:54.200
I could see you liking it, because I think that's kind of the great thing about it, because

56:54.200 --> 56:59.280
I think that the turn off about the touristy stuff, obviously, is like, the selfie stick,

56:59.280 --> 57:02.120
you have to buy the selfie stick, take the selfie stick, but it's kind of neat to just

57:02.120 --> 57:03.120
kind of...

57:03.120 --> 57:07.520
If I got comfortable, it would be, yeah, several, several visits, whatever.

57:07.520 --> 57:15.360
What I was blown away by is I had that box of cake, and I went to a little cafe and said,

57:15.360 --> 57:19.720
like, near the Eiffel Tower, I asked a waiter, is it okay if I eat this here?

57:19.720 --> 57:24.040
And he's like, only if you share with me.

57:24.040 --> 57:25.600
He wanted it in that fucking cake box.

57:25.600 --> 57:26.600
I had two little cakes.

57:26.600 --> 57:29.720
This is the story that blew Jeff away.

57:29.720 --> 57:38.280
The story where he went into a sex dungeon.

57:38.280 --> 57:41.400
I know he didn't say it, but time travel was applied.

57:41.400 --> 57:49.240
So I just like that the cursor to that, the cake story, was, this is what blew me away.

57:49.240 --> 57:50.240
This is what blew you.

57:50.240 --> 57:57.280
You were at the airport, and it said, like, whore on your forehead.

57:57.280 --> 58:04.400
You should write a new manual for men to replace the gay, which is such a pile of bullshit.

58:04.400 --> 58:07.920
Just called the box of cake.

58:07.920 --> 58:11.760
And we can just see men carrying around beautiful boxes of cake.

58:11.760 --> 58:19.200
What's the museum where all the, like, the Lizen Valides, where all the Napoleon's tomb

58:19.200 --> 58:21.080
is, where all the armory and all that shit is.

58:21.080 --> 58:25.440
I walked in there, and then I went, I didn't finish all the cake, and so I went into the,

58:25.440 --> 58:34.640
you sat at Napoleon's grave with the cake, and Napoleon was like, oh, you're going to

58:34.640 --> 58:38.600
share that with me.

58:38.600 --> 58:43.280
I was in Napoleon's tomb with my half-eaten cake, and then I had the box, and then I went

58:43.280 --> 58:51.040
across the road to the Musée Rodin, and I wanted to see the statue of Honoré de Balzac.

58:51.040 --> 58:55.320
I walk in there, and these two security guards come charging at me, and I'm assuming they're

58:55.320 --> 58:58.240
going to go, you can't bring food in here.

58:58.240 --> 59:00.800
And they're like, what is this?

59:00.800 --> 59:02.800
And I open it up and show them, and I was like, is it okay?

59:02.800 --> 59:06.680
And they're like, one guy's like, no, it's okay, you can bring food into the thing.

59:06.680 --> 59:14.560
And then the guy's like, no, no, you have to give it to me.

59:14.560 --> 59:20.800
I was like, for two euro, you walk into the fucking Musée Rodin gallery, and you're out

59:20.800 --> 59:24.240
in the fucking garden, and there's a fucking Le Pencero, there's this thinker by Rodin,

59:24.240 --> 59:27.360
and I'm fucking eating my cake, and no one gave a shit, like you couldn't bring cake

59:27.360 --> 59:30.520
into a museum in the States, it was the best.

59:30.520 --> 59:33.880
And then girls walk by in the smoke, and they fucking want to know about that cake.

59:33.880 --> 59:37.640
Was this cake made out of diamonds?

59:37.640 --> 59:40.040
It did, oh, it's so good.

59:40.040 --> 59:47.200
Come on, you guys, we keep a tight schedule on this show, and we got important shit to

59:47.200 --> 59:51.200
talk about with Spencer Crittenden, bring him out.

59:51.200 --> 01:00:10.520
Hey guys, you know, wouldn't you believe it, I read a fucking article about men carrying

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:17.760
cakes in public, and it's a great way for men to get the female experience of always

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:23.760
having eyes on them, you know, because men aren't traditionally stared out by everyone,

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.440
whereas women are, and it's really hard to kind of fathom that experience of all this

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:34.760
constant attention, but when a man is holding a cake, they get all that attention.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:40.360
Are you on PCP right now?

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:45.760
His mic's just a little up, I think, but wait, doesn't this imply that all women are

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.760
Kathy?

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.880
No, no.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.320
Did you say you read an article?

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.320
Did you really?

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.320
Oh yeah, yeah, I read an article.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.320
I love that.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.320
Yeah.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.840
Are you being glib, or did you really read an article?

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:00.600
Why would I make up an article that I read?

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:07.640
No, this lady, she was like, it's probably really hard for, you know, guys to fathom

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:13.080
what it's like to always be contemplating, you know, gazes on you, and to how that changes

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:17.640
your behavior and just the way you hold yourself and the way you walk, and then her partner

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:22.240
just was, by chance, carrying a cake, and noticed that everyone was staring at him,

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:26.480
and they talked about it, and she made this not exactly scientific test where she got

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:34.160
guys to carry various baked goods in public, and like, a plate of cookies, you know, nothing,

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:40.160
nothing, an exposed cake, oh boy, look out.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.560
Like a birthday-style cake?

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.560
Yeah, like on a stand.

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.080
Do you think it's, well, does the article talk about, is the idea because it's, because

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:51.600
of the psychological ramifications, the mystery behind it, or is it because everyone just

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.080
wants that cake?

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:57.000
I think that they said it was, it was part of that, it was both, it was, some people

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.960
wanted the cake and wanted to make jokes about getting the cake, and other people seemed

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.320
like they just wanted to wait for someone to drop the cake.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.280
Well, a lot of times, when men look at women that they want to fuck, it looks like they

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.680
want to eat them.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.680
Yeah.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.680
So, it's comparable.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:16.680
I don't know if you guys, Dan, you don't strike me as a person that buys flowers.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.680
9-11.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:25.680
I love the idea of someone walking in for the first time, and being like, what the fuck

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:26.680
with them?

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:27.680
Celebrating night.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.120
Dan actually buys flowers very frequently.

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:37.520
But if you walk down, walk down the street, like in a busy, like in New York, or Seattle,

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:43.400
or big town, walking down the road with flowers in your hand is aphrodisiac to everybody,

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:49.040
like everybody likes, people just like, oh, that guy thought about somebody else.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:56.320
I was my diet's cheat day yesterday, and I went to a Froyo place, and I got the biggest

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:03.200
bucket they had, and I filled it a quarter of the way through, and then I put all peanut

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:07.800
butter cups, and then I filled it another half way through, and then I put all peanut

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.720
butter cups, and a little bit of crushed peanut butter cup, and then I filled it the rest

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:17.720
of the way through, and I was just walking through Los Feliz, with, like, it was obvious

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:23.520
that I wasn't, like, taking it to a family, yeah, it had one spoon in it.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:29.200
Well, I went at the side of it, say, I said something like, just for me, you know, treating

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.200
myself today.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:37.320
Yeah, special day, or something, I, I, I, I, I, I don't, I think it's a, it's a cousin

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:42.440
of the concept, because of the prop I was carrying, I did feel like all of this extra

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:50.200
meaning to every, I wasn't allowed to just be in, in, in a, in a, in a shell as I walked

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:57.120
past people, I wasn't allowed to just be anonymous, like I had this prop, and I, and so I was

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:02.520
a story to any, every, everybody in every window, it was like, yeah, laugh it up, laugh

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.520
it up, you fuckers.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.000
That's, that's just what boobs are.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.520
Yeah, now you know how I feel, it's like I'm covered in frozen yogurt, all the time,

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:20.280
in candies, um, so, so, so, I say in the Garfield dress.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:27.400
So, I mean, like, I, I, I, I, I, I don't know what's happening to me right now, um,

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:33.440
the, uh, the, I, I wanted to, uh, we, we, we've been talking forever about, uh, you

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:40.360
know, the, the, the, like, trying a different game, from my childhood, my, my high school

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:47.600
days called Shadow Run, and, uh, and Spencer's been like reading the books, and like, I've,

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.680
I've seen him outside my, uh, writer's room, like, sitting there, reading the Shadow Run

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:56.880
books, getting very excited, uh, and you, like, like, we're not, we're not, we're not gonna,

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.920
we're not gonna play it tonight, but we're also not gonna play D&D, and we're, we'll

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:06.280
get, hey, fuck you people, if you, if you want to know how it feels to get that kind

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:12.960
of reaction, take up Treyah cookies, and wear them like a necklace, and then maybe you'll

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:20.040
start to get it, but they can't be oatmeal, because that's, it's the most masculine.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:25.560
Yeah, um, the, uh, put, put, put a pickle behind your ear, like it's a pencil, and you're

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:31.600
like, uh, handy smurf, and then on the other ear, just dangle a piece of pizza.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:37.040
Or wear a sign, wear, wear a sign, uh, around your neck that says, I forgot your cookies.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.040
Right.

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.040
Yeah.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:43.240
Your pencil was way too big to stay tucked behind that guy's ear.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:48.200
It's like a giant ass, it's like a microphone-sized pencil behind his ear.

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.600
But you don't know how stiff smurf cartilage is.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.680
It can't be that tough, like.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:59.360
Can I, can I just point out very quickly that there's a man in the audience, uh, whose

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:05.560
laugh is identical to Judge Dooms laugh, Christopher Lloyd's character, and Roger Rabbit, right

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:09.880
after, when he's, when you find out he's a cartoon, and he's turning into a cartoony,

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:15.080
like has that maniacal laugh, Dustin Marshall, uh, pointed that out backstage a little bit.

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.560
Who's, how's that laugh go?

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.560
Like that.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:23.840
Well, I don't want to do that, just, that's not what it sounded like, and that sounded

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.040
like I was making fun of you, but you're, that, like that.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.040
Is it a good laugh?

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.800
Are you, are you enjoying this laugh, or are you, are you?

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:33.320
I mean, I, I mean, I've gone through at first, I was like, huh.

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:37.520
And then I, and then I was like, oh, and then I was like, oh, neat.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.520
Okay, great.

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.520
We're all.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.520
That's the truth.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.520
Yeah.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520
Now I'm like, now I love it.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:48.560
Now it's like being covered in yogurt, but my yogurt for my own in front of a mirror.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:52.200
I'm not walking down the street, I'm in a room with mirrors and I just am seeing my

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.200
own yogurt.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.600
Yogurt, yogurt's a lot grosser when it's not frozen.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.280
Covered in my own sugar-free Greek yogurt.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:05.720
Spencer, do you have either logic problems with the Smurfs besides the size of a handy

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.720
yeah.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.280
I mean, there's just the one lady Smurf, right?

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.280
Yeah.

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.880
And they don't they lay eggs?

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:12.880
What?

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:13.880
Okay.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:18.040
But you know, the lady Smurf was created by Gilgamesh.

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.040
What's his name?

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.040
That's even more.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.040
Yeah.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.040
Isn't that even Gargamel Gargamel.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.040
Well, he took that from Gilgamesh.

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:30.680
It would have been would be impressive.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.000
Did they come out of the mushrooms?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.720
She was created by Hammurabi Smurf.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.720
Where did it?

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:39.720
Did they come?

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:40.720
I don't know.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.720
I don't know.

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:42.720
I know they're three apples high.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.720
But didn't they?

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.720
Are they?

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.720
What?

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:46.720
Yeah.

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.720
They're supposed to be three apples tall.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:48.720
Those are giant fucking mushrooms.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:53.600
Then they look like they could be easily crushed underfoot, but three apples, man, those are

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.600
huge mushrooms.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.600
Yeah, they're up to your knee.

01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.560
You can tell from the Pac-Man cartoon that they definitely ripped off Smurfs like they

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:01.960
had a Gargamel figure.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.960
I can't remember.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:03.960
What was his name?

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:04.960
Mesmeron?

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:05.960
Are you sure?

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:06.960
The Pac-Man doesn't pre-date?

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.960
The Pac-Man cartoon?

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:08.960
Oh, the cartoon.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:13.480
I didn't like the Pac-Man had hands and feet and had gloves on for some reason.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:14.720
Well, what's he supposed to do?

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.560
What's the cartoon supposed to be?

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:20.480
I'm not a rhetorical question, but what would that cartoon be?

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:25.480
He's just floating in space and he's like, well, I ate one dot.

01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:26.480
Time to eat another one.

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:28.480
Like, how do you get 100 episodes out of that?

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.480
Like, what do you do at Christmas?

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:33.480
He had to have gloves.

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.480
You have a ton of dots.

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.480
Yeah.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.480
They weren't just gloves.

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.480
They were kind of gauntlets.

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:42.800
He had big, fancy gloves.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.240
Cartoons always seem to be wearing gloves.

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.240
Yeah.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.600
Because hands are scarier.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.000
You could just draw the hands.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
The hands are like nature's gloves.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.680
Lights the glove.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:57.520
And then you could not have the little wristy part of the glove and you'd have a hand.

01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.520
I didn't realize until we were creating a...

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.000
The hand fills out the glove shape perfectly.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
That's why it's that shape.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Sorry, sorry.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.240
Well, I bet I know why they wear gloves, maybe because the old days like cell animation,

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:17.560
like the color, when you were, the way you made things move is by putting like transparency

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:18.560
on top of transparency.

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.520
There was always like a color differentiation between things that are moving and things

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.800
that are static.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:27.360
So making sure that anything that's going to be moving a lot is like a different color

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.920
than the thing next to it, maybe, is like a good idea.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.920
Just a thought.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:31.920
Right.

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:32.920
Right.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:36.080
So if it...

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:43.840
Of course, because we all grew up on animation, but I'm saying, you're saying what I'm saying

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:44.840
though, right?

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:48.200
Is that because it's a different cell, because we've all seen those like Scooby Doo cartoons

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.920
where it's like, they're walking by a mountain and you're like, gee, I wonder if there's

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.040
a secret door there, because it's like, you know, it's going to move.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.120
So it's like different color, different, just slightly different shade, because it's

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.120
like through the...

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.120
Did I tell you guys I was...

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.760
I drove with an Uber driver who was like a he-man, the second biggest collector of

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.920
he-man cells.

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:06.920
The second biggest?

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:07.920
Second biggest.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.400
I love that he knew he was the second.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.400
I was like, who's the first?

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.400
And he knew his name.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.400
And I was like, are you...

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.400
Was he angry?

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.400
Yeah.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.400
I was like, are you guys enemies?

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.400
He's like, no, no, we are.

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:19.600
I was like, he's like your cringer or whatever.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:24.760
So anyways, I didn't know until we did Rick and Morty that you have to pick the number

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.880
of fingers when you do a...

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:33.040
You know, Justin, I had to sit down and Justin's like, okay, it's time for the finger conversation.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.160
How many fingers are human beings going to have?

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.720
And the thing was like, well, fucking five, motherfucker.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:44.800
And he's like, well, take it easy there, cowboy.

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.720
Five fingers runs into money.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:51.160
Like the Simpsons have four fingers, don't they?

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.160
Anyway, it's weird.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:57.200
It's like 25% more fingers you have to draw.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.200
It adds up.

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.800
I mean, this budgetary minded stuff.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.800
Yeah.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:02.800
Well, yeah.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:03.800
Yeah, I'm not...

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.320
Garfield has four.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:10.560
Spencer, have you played Shadowrun before?

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.560
No.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:16.360
What are your impressions off the bat of Shadowrun?

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.560
It's a great system.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.560
You don't believe that.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.440
I believe that.

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:27.520
The Shadowrun universe is...

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.560
It sure is, Dan.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:34.320
We'll be right back.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.840
Squarespace, it helps you make your own website.

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:43.400
I'm here to talk about Bonobos.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:47.440
It takes place in the dark future of mankind.

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.000
Corporations have taken over the government.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Mega corporations, Dan.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.080
Imagine that.

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:58.360
But in addition to that, in addition to all that far-flowing future business where there's

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:03.560
all the hacking and the laser swords and the implants and the bionic things, there has

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:09.120
been an awakening, an awakening has happened along the way, in addition to the world going

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:15.440
to shit just for regular conventional reasons, there was an awakening where magic returned.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:20.640
People started deforming, turning into trolls and elves and goblins and orcs and things.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.560
And there's dragons and stuff that are, did I read correctly that there's a dragon that

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.560
gave an interview?

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:31.440
Yeah, that was Dunkels on, I think, from pronouncing that right, Dunkels on.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.440
He became the first dragon president.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.120
My mom's made a name.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.120
It's true.

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.120
It's Dunkel.

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.120
It's a good name.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.120
No.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.120
Zahn means son.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:45.640
Now, before we embark on this, are we saying goodbye to our D&D campaign for Dunkels?

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:46.640
Don't say goodbye.

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:47.640
I'm glad you asked.

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:48.640
Say good journey.

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:49.640
Oh, sorry.

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:50.640
Oh.

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.640
I know.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.800
What does good journey mean, Dan?

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.800
Just a reference to the Dolph Lunger and He-Man movie from...

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.800
It doesn't.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:00.800
Okay.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:06.080
Dan's the third biggest collector of He-Man.

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.080
It's great.

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:14.920
If you actually look at a bird's eye map of Castle Grayskull, it's identical to Dealey

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:15.920
Plaza.

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.920
Yeah.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:24.800
So, that's a great question, Jeff.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.800
I'm glad you asked.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:26.800
Thanks, President.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:27.800
I don't really know the answer to that.

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:29.080
I feel like it's easy enough to put out.

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:32.760
I mean, we don't have to set our D&D stuff on fire.

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.480
That story's not done, obviously.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.720
You don't know how I DM, then.

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:37.720

the the most guaranteed comedy sports suggestion from from during the three

year period it's horrible a few years ago he did a porn did he do that 25

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:19.360
years ago no it's just a funny thing that a friend of mine pointed out that

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:24.120
anyone under like 25 does not know that story that's fascinating I want to know

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:29.880
why well what happened 20 like when people are talking about yeah I know

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:36.360
but when why why aren't they when were they because when you were when it

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.800
happened you were too young for your parents to tell you about a guy who's

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:49.400
dick it happened oh it happened like early oh 94 someone knows it and why

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:57.720
why was it notable it was just like a bit like a highly publicized like true

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:02.680
crime I read like six or seven stories about crazy mishaps involving penis

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:07.560
severings I mean I was in a mishap and we were she followed through sounds like

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:13.240
a mishap I heard about a woman I don't know where I heard this maybe this is a

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.400
thing everyone knows about or maybe something that just happened if someone

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:20.240
that I like a friend of a friend some a guy the woman didn't like him she was

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:26.360
mad at him and she superglued his dick to his stomach I think I think that was

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:32.560
dialogue from reservoir dogs that's what you're thinking of I don't know that

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:36.680
Harvey Keitel told sorry I well it's that's pretty interesting concept though

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.520
that you could stand that you can pick a random thing or not a random thing a

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:43.280
very decided thing because that's the thing you're looking for that there's a

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:50.080
there there's a there's a momentum to pop cultural zeitgeist and the John Wayne

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:55.920
bobbitt thing like the foam of that surf like stops just before the toes of

01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:00.480
someone at a certain age I think that's very do you know about Nancy Kerrigan

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:05.400
and Tony Hardin let me tell you about Nancy Kerrigan wait was that figure

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:11.840
skating yeah yeah I my roommate watched a documentary about that that I was

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:15.920
listening to it's back in the news but how do you heard about it before the

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:20.480
documentary thing when I when I heard the incident I was like oh shit this was

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:25.280
big when I was like seven or something like I definitely heard echoes of it

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:28.800
but yeah I don't I don't really yeah doesn't it seem a little bit like and

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.160
maybe this is an illusion of we're in between them like I remember and the

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.800
last one I can remember is like Octo mom like everyone there's like when there's

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:39.680
when there's this thing that has no stakes to global society at all but it's

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:42.520
just like everyone's talking about it because it's just like when you focus

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:47.440
in on it it's it's everyone just wants to talk about Octo mom the the like it

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:53.360
seems like we've been we've been in this reverse oasis of our sandbar of like like

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:58.120
are those days over because I just be working too hard I mean they're there

01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:02.560
a lot I'm not doing it that I mean they're they're a ton of like true crime

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.960
things that are constantly in the news that Casey Anthony was pretty I don't

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:11.320
think Octo mom's yeah crime thing though well she was like I don't know well

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:18.160
she I guess I mean I mean it does count because it's like relative to what

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.400
should be important to anybody it is one human life and it shouldn't it's like

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:26.200
yeah our decision to focus in on it yeah Casey Anthony was a thing I guess

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.760
those just pop up once in a while it just feels like we've been through this

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:33.680
patch right now it was just fucking like darkness darkness dark like this river

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:37.840
sticks of like like oh there's Bill Cosby's head floating I can recognize

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:42.200
that but like like like everything is just more over just kind of like real

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:45.720
like everything's kind of real right well and I didn't want to imply that the

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:51.920
Casey Anthony story was fun no no no it's not fun it's not hard to but but no

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:57.280
there's bigger fish to fry than 350 million people focused on one verdict

01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:01.560
of one case to be sure so those there's like these things that pop up let's just

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:05.440
wonder it seemed like in the but I think that's how you remember time like if I

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:09.800
look back through the 80s I'll remember like all of those things these little

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:14.280
maples that we danced around and I won't remember like the lava flow of

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:19.520
actual society stuff just also like turns over so much more quickly that I

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.960
used to right now it's just like I did with every with every passing day it's

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:27.480
like I don't know where the tipping points are or where they've been but it

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:32.440
just it's like it seems like I was one of like either they're gonna invent some

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:38.720
phrase for it now or you can't even exist as a as an entertainment like kind of

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:42.200
person like you you have to make a decision in your life whether you're

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.760
gonna dip a toe in that river or not like you have to have a relationship with

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:51.920
it because it's like there's just too much available reality now you can't you

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:55.840
can't like there's there's a camera on everything everything is documented all

01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:01.480
of the all of the goo is seeping up it's all available to us I could I could I

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:05.400

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:11.240
tradition as you walk back to your seat Dan is going to list every major event

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:18.800
that's happened in the last 30 years also spanking machine

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:25.000
which is a dad which we called Jeff's apartment

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:32.600
all right yeah for each of the 30 steps back to your seat I will I will

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:36.760
recount a the world in pictures

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:52.680
thank you Laura thank you thank you she walked so fast it's just a blur of

01:26:52.680 --> 01:27:02.760
Bill Clinton it's all I remember did you say Bill Clinton is 1999 yeah all right

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:10.280
suspender shadow run late on us you guys are great at segues well what we have

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:16.080
to talk about is what kind of characters we would like to play yeah so yeah I mean

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:20.840
there's there's a way you guys got to make the characters so in general there's

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:26.640
kind of five roles the roles are kind of like classes but they're not really

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:32.080
there's not strictly classes and shadow runs so the first role is the face you

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:37.720
know he's the guy he's like Jeff Davis he knows people and he tells stories and

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:42.680
he talks and you know he's that guy he know you know that's a role yeah it's

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.480
whenever whenever there's a crew of people in a movie in a caper movie they

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:52.120
go to a guy who knows some people he's a face man that's the face yeah yeah

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:56.280
because because the words the the title of the game shadow run comes from the

01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:01.640
idea that that in the future there's the corporations control like the world the

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:04.600
mega corporations they can have their own armies and they have their own law

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:09.440
and the world is kind of a mishmash of craziness and alliances and and stuff

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:15.040
and there's and there's these mercenaries that that dwell in the shadows

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:19.200
that can you know if you if you need something done and you can't do it

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.080
through legitimate channels like the a team you go you go to these people

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:28.440
shadow runners face man's an actual character from a team is there a it's

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:33.960
all it's like they can I be be a be a barack yeah you can he's a troll is it

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:39.880
in in shadow one is a troll yeah make the rules yeah okay so what else you got

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:46.760
the face man you got the troll you know trolls are a race Jeff you said there

01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:50.840
weren't no races classes yeah there's no classes okay so the classes are what

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:56.440
sorry okay there's the face after the face there's what I hate to refer to as

01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:03.320
the street samurai that's a simple essentially a guy who owns weapons yeah

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:06.480
they're they're the muscle you know sometimes they got rocket launchers

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:10.960
sometimes they just got swords and sticks and shit but they use them for

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:16.000
tasks street samurai street samurai so they're fighters with weapons yeah okay

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:21.000
then you got you got the Decker that's your hacker that's kind of like the the

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.040
whole thing about the future is instead of the internet they got the matrix and

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:30.040
the matrix is like this virtual overlaid world so like if I was looking in the

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:35.560
matrix I'd see like a virtual mic stand and like a virtual table and then it

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:38.880
would be all like this is a mic stand made by Sony corp and you know it's all

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:43.200
virtual reality sort of thing and then the Deckers they they hack that shit they

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:46.960
have these little portable computers that can do illegal stuff and they can

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:52.400
steal money and you know do hacking things gotcha like hackers would I don't

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:59.680
know they could disable your cyber eyes or something you know my cyber eyes yeah

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:04.800
if you have them that's a make-up car and shatter you can get cyber eyes lots

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:09.040
of people have like implants bionic implants yeah okay so we got we got the

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:13.800
face the street samurai the Decker the Decker then you got your rigor a rigor

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:18.760
is like a hacker but they work with vehicles and machines cuz in this far

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:22.760
flung you future people don't really know how to drive everything just kind of

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:26.040
drives automatically using this thing called grid guide which is essentially

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:34.400
like if you had to do what ways told you to so it's just like that and so no one

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:38.360
knows how to drive unless you like spent time learning how to drive and then the

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:41.760
advanced people are rigors where they can actually jump into the into the

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:47.000
internet and control vehicles from the inside like like go in and be the vehicle

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.640
and they also control drones which are robots and stuff so that's the rigor then

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:56.760
you got your magic users which are broken up into your shamans and your

01:30:56.760 --> 01:31:01.320
sorcerers as well as your adepts and shamans are like you know they they

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:05.480
pray to spirits and that's where they get their magic and sorcerers they're

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:09.240
just wizards and shit and then adepts are like they're like people that are

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:13.600
really good at stuff in a magical way so like if you were if you could punch

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:17.560
through a wall that would because you're like magically strong but you couldn't

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:28.040
like shoot fireballs and stuff that's five right yep yeah yeah I have some more

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:33.680
questions about the adepts yeah like so so are you a certain kind of adept would

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:37.920
you be like I am like a muscly adept that punches through walls yeah like there

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:41.600
could be an adept who's like a master with the swordsman so like if you think

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:45.160
of a swordsman who could like slice a grasshopper in half with eyes closed

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:49.320
that would be like an almost magical level of skill or if someone could like

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:54.160
be so good at card games or shooting guns or something that it really you know

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:58.200
is it like shape-shifting without shape-shifting are you like absorb like you

01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:06.760
get to absorb it's like it's like Neo in the matrix I would say I tried Adam I

01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:19.720
tried I got one I tried to help you anyway yeah no adepts like adepts are

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:24.480
like there's a guy you know he's maybe an assassin and he's got magical abilities

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:29.720
that augment his assassin ship okay but maybe there's a better because the the

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:40.240
the like the the there's probably a permutation of of the class system that

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:45.240
allows for just about any kind of character you would want to be so it

01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:50.320
kind of begs the question like what you know yeah so knowing what little I've

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:54.280
told you about the setting if you had a character concept that'd be a great

01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:59.960
place to start so like if I was if I was in the world of shadow run I'd be like

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:06.520
the well-mannered nerd who knows enough but not enough to save his own ass or you

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:13.400
know like something like that you start yeah you start with like a tagline as

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:19.160
your character concept yeah you know

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:26.920
that's a character concept I wish you're a big fan of that movie Lucy I

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:32.600
remember that's my favorite movie ever the movies though the dumbest piece of

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:41.780
whatever but so exhilarating but ten minutes before the end of that movie

01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:46.280
Aaron said god damn it why does this movie have to be ending I don't know

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:50.360
the last time that I felt that you wanted Scarlett Johansson to keep turning

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:55.040
into I just want to start improvising yeah I like her go through the ground and

01:33:55.040 --> 01:34:00.040
then the earth she starts juggling the solar system and then eating it and then

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:07.760
quickly in that movie like they make the big deal in that movie which is like

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:15.360
Asian guys with guns like a totally no-stakes deal like it's about 20% of

01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:19.760
her brain she can just make everyone in the world fall down right and then like

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:23.520
for another hour and a half after that it's like now what's she gonna do and

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:28.400
can she you can always make everyone fall down that thing you do where you

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:34.080
just kill the planet and then teleport about Aaron is saying is this movie

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:39.320
gonna end with her like taking the Sun out of the sky and throwing it at a

01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:51.920
guy's Lucy you should check it out so the job of these shadow runners is like

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:56.320
they're kind of like guns for hire though the people that like yeah they do

01:34:56.320 --> 01:35:00.200
illegal stuff the whole thing is okay there is this incident that happened

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:04.640
where the Native Americans they formed their own state and they stole nuclear

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:09.200
warheads and they're holding the whole world hostage and as a kind of a result

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:15.400
of that get Spencer really soon really quick when Spencer sent this email today

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:18.400
explaining all of this and then I had some questions about like the attitudes

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:21.720
towards the other races and in the email you see you said well you know like

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:26.760
everybody hates Native Americans and I thought that is not you that is not the

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:30.600
day that like your understanding of the world is that everyone it's Native

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:33.800
Americans and I was like holy shit and I would just like let it go but this is

01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:37.800
it within the world that is not the diction I use I feel like Native

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:41.600
Americans have been getting a free ride in this country for too long no that's

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.880
not that's not what he no he didn't say anything about I thought I think use

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:51.560
those words exactly no no no everyone in the world of shadow run is racist

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:55.800
against Indians because you know they they they took the world hostage with

01:35:55.800 --> 01:36:01.520
nuclear weapons okay and what like terrorists I'm not familiar with that

01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:05.680
and did that resolve to the yeah you know they shot missiles but the missiles

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:10.440
didn't didn't didn't get to where they were going no one knows why oh so then

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:15.680
as a result of that the the governments of the various nations were like shit

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:20.520
man you companies you need to be able to protect yourselves and so they started

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:24.200
hiring private armies and then they got this thing called extra territorial

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:28.360
status which basically meant that corporations set the rules instead of

01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:31.840
the governments and then they formed their own government called the corporate

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:36.560
court so as of that all the corporations started rewriting the rules and

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:40.360
started getting all the money and start making everyone kind of into this you

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:46.360
know these dystopian wage slaves so when everyone is is kind of just slaves to

01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:51.080
corporations and corporations only have to play by the rules that they set when

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:54.600
they don't want to play within those rules they hire shadow runs or shadow

01:36:54.600 --> 01:37:02.920
runners to do stuff like murder politicians or steel hi-tech shoes those

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:06.320
are gonna be your first two missions

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:12.320
yeah like a shadow run is one of these covert operations and shadow runners are

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:17.840
basically mercenaries yeah so yeah so we have a jacuzzi we're like we moonlight

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:21.600
as shadow runners well in this the thing is in the world you need this thing

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:25.040
called an sion that's essentially like a credit card number that everyone has

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:27.760
well it's like a credit card in the social security number it's what the

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:31.400
governments used to track you but shadow runners don't have those so they can

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:35.160
kind of live outside of the world or outside the law but as a result they

01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:38.520
can't actually have jobs in the normal way so the only way they make their

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:42.880
living is with crime and with doing these runs if you got you're outed as a

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:47.800
shadow and are you imprisoned like is it illegal to be one it is illegal to be one

01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:50.920
but that's why they always use false IDs so you'll probably be running with three

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:54.400
or four false IDs so if someone's like oh that's Kyle Robertson where you're

01:37:54.400 --> 01:38:02.000
like I'm James Jamerson now it is illegal but they they have ways around it

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.520
oh you know who would be helpful in this is DeMorge Brown is DeMorge Brown here

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:15.280
DeMorge? DeMorge are you here? There is a really big DeMorge Brown fan over there

01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:20.760
hopefully not too big I thought if we're gonna if we're gonna make character

01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:26.080
are you gonna be here next week you don't have to I'm scrolling through my

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:30.400
schedule right now it doesn't yes I just wanted to get some get some get the

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:33.400
pudding stirred here a little bit we're making we're making we're making

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:36.000
characters now do we have to decide right now or should we should we sleep on

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.640
this and go home should I do some more research and think about this more or

01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:44.760
should I fire from the hip and pick a character I mean I don't care for the

01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:48.840
presentation of it maybe we should come up with character ideas and then if you

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:53.160
change your mind we could go from there just for the audience like what you're

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:59.080
saying when you're describing those five roles what you mean by that is is like

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:03.720
that those are kind of skill sets in order for there to be a successful like

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:08.480
kind of typical mission like you kind of want those points covered or at least

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:13.080
a couple of right so so what does the face man again like what he's the guy

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:18.240
that you go to for what he just knows people so if it's all if it's like oh

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:25.840
I need to be smuggled into the sewers of Borneo yeah he has a cake box maybe he

01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:30.240
knows maybe he has a guy who's high up in the business so if you need to get

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:35.080
some business intel he knows what's going on at the Shiawase Corp for instance

01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:41.080
so he's like Huggy Bear and Starsky and Hutch thank you DeMorge he's like that

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:46.240
thing that he said DeMorge your hair has become tremendous as well yeah you have

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:51.440
the Dan Harmon beard of hair right I think it's all it's just letting it fly

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:56.600
man it's good stuff is it easy to maintain how is that I just let it sit

01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:02.780
there when it needs to be reordered I pull it all out and it curls back in on

01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:07.600
itself over the course of a month I like it yeah I mean obviously I'm gonna be

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:12.560
the face man of the group that's that's obvious that's obvious I thought that

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.040
would you know I've never I've never been a magic user so I'm tempted to be a

01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:20.240
magic user because I've never done it all right so do you want to be a shaman

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:24.280
or a sorcerer shaman's kind of they revere spirits whereas sorcerers are

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:32.080
like this is a science to use magic the function who wants me to be a shaman who

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:41.360
wants me to be a sorcerer I'll be a rigor who I'm a sorcerer Spencer I'm a

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:45.360
sorcerer all right so what who's confused about the vehemence of the

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:51.760
opinions oh nobody nobody okay but also there's race so there's dwarf and

01:40:51.760 --> 01:41:02.480
human I want to be a black sorcerer okay or a dirty Irish potato sorcerer I mean

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:12.800
so there's human and or control and elf and dwarf who's black too I imagine an

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:16.960
elf sorcerer be pretty good at being a sorcerer right who wants me to be an

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:28.680
elf sorcerer who has no opinion I'm a Decker we should Spencer could you as a

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:33.520
as a GM could you give some advice on like what would be what would make us

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:41.160
happiest as individuals when choosing what we are like should we are you saying

01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:47.680
what character would you like to kill off less quickly than your other character

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:52.080
what like should we be choosing characters that fit I don't know like

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:56.080
your opinion obviously there's not like right or wrong I mean if you think

01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:01.080
about a character in like a TV show it's like that could be summed up in like a

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:05.760
thing and then a character like that might be appealing to you so it's like oh

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:10.880
she's the bubbly the girl next door like that could be like a kind of concept so

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:15.080
whatever appeals to you as a concept of a character you might want to play even

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:18.800
independent of abilities and stuff that's what I have an opinion about

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:22.680
whether people are most I mean like because there's two philosophies one is

01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:26.240
you play a person who like you could never be in real life and then the other

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:30.600
is to like kind of play a mythologized version of what you are in real life yeah

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:35.080
and they're both valid like for role-playing but like do you do you

01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:45.280
what what do you do when you play I play as little girls man yeah perfect

01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:57.080
too soon no I play as I play as a character I exclusively play as

01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:06.080
characters that are skinny well okay so do you play they can jump higher do you

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:10.440
play is but I mean like as far as personality goes do your characters

01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:14.360
tend to be more like what you want to be or what you aren't or what you dare not

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:21.440
be let me utilize intelligence you know like yeah nobody mean as far as the your

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:27.560
relationship to that character what kind would it what should I do I'm gonna

01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:31.240
make a decision for myself right now only because I think this will be fun I

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:36.600
want to be a 15 year old girl who is an elf sorcerer all right yeah I want to

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:42.360
be like I got like a like a young high school girl like age well Erin like a

01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:53.880
doesn't franchise just like disaffected like a little punk rock chick when we're

01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:58.600
playing I mean what do you tend to find yourself doing you know like you you

01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:05.400
you you certainly craft a lot of things like you you like to find yeah well I'm

01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:18.480
I'm I'm torn Adam what yeah I was kind of thinking that like see like taking the

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:22.600
existing world I would agree with that like like like oh can I make that car

01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:29.480
do this or yeah okay cool well I mean I mean part of me really wants to play

01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:32.640
like so it was like something that I'm not that I would really like to be like

01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:41.080
like a really short strong immigrant man I did not expect that to get a laugh I

01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:45.000
feel like that's obvious it like deep down inside it's just funny how

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:51.800
convicted you are a lot of phrases that are funny when you just say them but

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:55.400
then obviously like I really like crafting things and coming up with

01:44:55.400 --> 01:45:00.240
different maybe you should start with a name first what country what country

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:06.160
do you emigrate from oh just like emigrate from an Eastern European

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:10.440
country well good news most of the Eastern European countries have been

01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:16.760
buried by radioactive sludge so there's great reason to emigrate from them

01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:24.000
emigrate is a 21st century form of immigration are you you send yourself to

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:30.320
a computer what I think I like within the game the things that I enjoy the most

01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:37.440
are like my character like pretending to be something or trying to talk to people

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:42.400
I guess I don't know I just like talking to people about how they feel that could

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:47.760
be which that could be like the the face man you know you'll you'll stroll up to

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:53.640
the security guard and be all like hey man I'm here on an inspection and then

01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:56.880
you'll roll some dice and maybe he'll believe it so it's always my favorite

01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:04.920
part of the adventure is when Aaron is in charge of go ahead Aaron go talk to

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:09.840
the guy okay yeah yeah all right so you just yeah I mean well that yeah that

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:15.240
would probably be a disaster everyone would be really mad I hey entertainment

01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:23.000
is a disaster it's what you enjoy okay well I enjoy I like talking to the

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:29.800
other characters I also like magic can I be a magic face yeah I mean they're like

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:34.640
we were talking about adept there's like an adept face might be like a guy who or

01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:39.680
a girl who's like so charismatic and beautiful that it's beyond you know the

01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:51.040
normal world I think we have a way that's a yes that is a yes I mean like

01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:56.440
people are like I mean how did that happen I mean look at that face yes yes

01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:08.120
I would yeah yes I would like that I yes okay okay what do you want to be

01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:13.480
yeah I'm well I'm just gonna go I'll just go with my my old like when I played

01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:17.680
shadow run the first time like I you know if his name is Jim Nightblade that's

01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:24.520
fine like I like us I guess he'd be a street samurai category because it just

01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:27.920
it's just more like an assassin yeah you probably just have a lot of gear and

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:34.720
stuff yeah like a like like specialty in stealth and like kill you know killing

01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:43.320
killing yeah yeah quiet five o'clock shadow very very sexy obviously but yeah

01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:48.200
I'm not totally unintentionally yeah I'm not gonna physically describe them you'll

01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:56.160
you'll you'll get there like kind of ripped and you have you have like old

01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:04.080
doodles of Jim Nightblade in your journal yeah that is a promise if I find a

01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:15.320
dude all very yeah world world weary design right down in any of those

01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:19.960
things that'll be like your duty to bring to the character you know yeah I'm

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:26.560
just gonna write down like six four thirteen you know numbers and shit what's

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:38.040
what's left to Marge it's you can't be black oh can I be would I be is there

01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:44.160
some sort of cross between a street samurai and then almost like a hajira

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:50.440
grab like a person that move read can read a mood can shift with the mood as a

01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:54.880
situation changes what can sense a mood change in the situation before it gets

01:48:54.880 --> 01:49:04.880
there like he's highly perceptive yes if there was a if we were going from a to

01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:07.480
be an in-between that there were several different types of people to

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:11.800
encounter or maybe is there somebody would be like since they can't have

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:25.920
jobs that they would have we said you can't be black I'm not even I don't

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:30.240
get it standing perfectly stills for the people who can't read this at home

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:35.840
I'm okay sir you know characters in that world sometimes there they have these

01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:41.200
underground jobs like they're the greeter at a hotel or they're a greeter at a

01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:45.080
like a casino it's an underground casino or something but they have all this

01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:50.440
other information so for people in that world they have one face for people in

01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:55.960
the know they do something completely different and they always have this sort

01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:01.000
of broad personality for the people in the regular road so hello hi away that

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000
kind of thing and then out there out of the other side of their mouth they're

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.480
whispering vital information people are doing something else is that so they're

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:13.960
like well read I don't at the street level maybe

01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:19.200
I mean a charisma thing or well I mean it sounds what about a street samurai

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:25.200
that could that can kind of convince other people that can change form in

01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:32.360
front of other people change like the newspaper guy from men in black

01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:39.480
I'm a street samurai yeah yeah I mean what you're yeah that's a thing

01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:45.560
definitely it sounds like what you're describing is just a guy who has this

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:50.760
like a precog that can walk around like a what like a precog that can walk around

01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:56.400
oh I don't know if there's anything like that quite there's not really psychic

01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:02.200
ability so much as magic okay sorry so just a street samurai that's all right

01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:08.760

01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:18.840
that fuck good could put no I guess there's not a show to say yeah we're

01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:22.000
getting a rocky start coming back from the new year so there's no show next

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:28.680
week but then there's one one the one the week after that how about that for

01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:33.880
for so what what do we have to do between now and the next show Spencer in

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:36.920
terms of character do you have to roll stats and stuff like that no I'll take

01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:40.440
care of all that just think about the characters you want to create and their

01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:45.440
backgrounds and what they their interests might be you know stuff like that now

01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:49.520
you're like a super magic guy so you probably don't want a lot of like robot

01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:55.520
parts girl yeah girl but the rest of you the rest of you guys think about maybe

01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:59.920
also what kind of robot parts you want like maybe if you have to have a metal

01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:04.800
spleen no no you don't what is that based like what how are we making that

01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:08.160
decisions why would we want a metal because it's the future man you can

01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:11.760
have laser eyes and shit and I don't know it's that's part of it if you want to

01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:18.240
have a robot arm that has like a like a laser eye in it if you want like an eye

01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:23.520
that shoots laser drinking fountain and your thumb I can't I can't be robotic

01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:30.440
because I'm a magic user yeah fucks up your magics good yeah yeah I love this

01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:35.280
so think about those things and I'll all work on making the characters you know

01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:42.360
backgrounds your histories what what you do on Thursday evenings stuff like

01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:46.840
that I eat Lincoln berries what what is what is what does Jim nightblade do on

01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:53.040
a Thursday evening just like he just looks out at the futuristic cityscape

01:54:53.040 --> 01:55:08.280
and wonders how it got to this over over a vial of blue liquid are we are we

01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:11.440
returning in two weeks with a presentation or poetry about our

01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:17.760
characters are you have to write up to me yeah that would be great like like

01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:21.280
like we should we should do like old-school like like like mazes and

01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:29.440
monsters you have to like introduce your character I am Haryana of the yeah I

01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:34.480
don't know we'll figure it out we'll do a minute presentation any medium we would

01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:40.840
we would like except PowerPoint except PowerPoint I also feel like structurally

01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:52.240
I hate PowerPoint we so is the gameplay the same as a D&D like I mean for you

01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:58.760
guys it probably will be yeah yeah it'll be pretty familiar I would like on our

01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:03.920
side I will take the step toward like improving things by I'm gonna I think

01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:09.800
we'll try to do is move the gameplay session into the middle of the show so

01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:13.800
that we're not always like riproar and drunk and it's not like the thing that

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:18.400
we'll save for the end it's like it's like a thing we do at the goddess point

01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:23.600
of the story and not the not the end so that we can yeah I don't know just the

01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:27.120
thought all right that way that way it'll maybe we'll get a little it'll have a

01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:31.520
little more consistency I'm always so fucking drunk by the by the time we

01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:37.080
play D&D like I never remember anything Dan would it would it be okay if we did

01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:42.520
and when I say we I mean me would it would it be okay if I if we because I

01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:46.280
don't want to speak for everybody but like if we did maybe have a presentation

01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:53.240
in two weeks of our characters would that be okay that's fine and also it's a

01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:59.080
visual medium now so any any incentive to yeah if you have a hat or something

01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:04.920
that that you play the character then that's that's all the more reason to I

01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:13.720
see Jane is here Brad earth shine and I'm glad I didn't I've been drinking the

01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:20.560
absence and I'm high as a Georgia pine over the shit is fucking wild I have to

01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:38.400

01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:54.560

01:57:54.560 --> 01:58:02.600
to just a just a song it's just a song that that that Brett Britta used to

01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:08.800
