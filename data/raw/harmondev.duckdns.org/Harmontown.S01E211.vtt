WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Music

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
From Hollywood, California, Harmontown is now in session!

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Music

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Spencer Stritton in everybody, Spencer!

00:20.000 --> 00:29.000
Music

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
And the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:31.000 --> 00:42.000
Music

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Alright, is the four-year-old gone?

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Laughter

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
What did I miss last week, Dan?

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
A four-year-old, and so here's the thing about parenting.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Laughter

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Just don't involve me.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Laughter

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
It's not from the back of the room because, like, as Spencer points out,

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
little kids, they need to pee in poop.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
They got tiny bladders at subpoint A1.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Like, there's many, many points we could go into,

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
but just bladders alone.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
I thought you knew way more than you were supposed to about

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
prepubescent digestive systems.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Let me tell you about...

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
At C point A1, at subpoint B sub2,

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
that's where their bladders really just explode in size.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I have a question. When she...

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
I was just listening to an audio yesterday in my car.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
When she sat back down, did she start crying?

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Oh, yeah. Well, she started crying before she sat back down.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
We hooked her on that fucking Hollywood stage magic, man.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
She got a taste of it.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
She's got nothing to compare it to.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
We created a child star.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
But when you gave her a chance...

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
When you gave her a chance...

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
When she had a chance to speak, she was like,

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
Look, man. She was being a refused Nick.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
And then she got back in her seat and she cried.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
She was like, I fucking blew my chance.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
But honestly, she was...

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
She just cried because she was sitting up on stage

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
and she liked it.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I know exactly how that feels.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I would love to not...

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I was the little kid in those pajamas

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
that would come out in the living room.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
I'm sure it's Los Angeles.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Probably half of the audience or more.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
It was the kid in the family

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
that was like, look at me, look at me.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
And it feels good when strangers pay attention to you

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
because you know that while they're doing it,

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
your parents can't hit you.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
It's safe.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
It's like that moment in Texas Chainsaw Massacre

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
when you're flagging down the cop car.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
It's like, nothing bad can happen now.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Oh, it's the cop that makes chili out of people.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Also, second question.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
How old is Timur?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Timur is 16.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I was trying to visualize him

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
because I can't afford the subscription to our show.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah, I love my neighbors.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
The Bootsons, of course, they humanize me.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Of course, I'm all caught up in the Hollywood lifestyle.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I'm a cynical person.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
I'm a Capricorn.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
I'm hierarchical.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
I'm patriarchal.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm self-loathing.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I don't smell the roses.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
I don't notice avocado trees or eucalyptus.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
You know, she makes me muffins.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
It's like, oh, your life is happening right into your nose.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
And she comes on the podcast and everybody loves her.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
She wrote a poem for a dead eucalyptus tree.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
She represents, like, you know, like, oh, this is real life, man.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
It's fucking God is in the moment.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
You know, you're living in the past and the future.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
You got to keep it real, like your neighbor.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
And then, like, I was like, thank you so much for doing the show.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
People love you.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
You should come back any time.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
And she was like, thanks.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I have two screenplays for you to read.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
So I didn't have it that wrong.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
Your son makes horror mazes for a living now, right?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Like, that's a weird thing.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
I think that's pretty interesting.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I'd like to check back in with him.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
I want to go too.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
I want to see...

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Because teenagers have a notoriously small attention span.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Like, you're not supposed to...

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
If you get into something when you're like 12,

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
and you're still into it when you're 16,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
it makes you neither a hero nor a villain,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
but it makes you noteworthy.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
I want to check in with that guy.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Have you ever gone through one of these horror mazes

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
or you just heard them from across the fence?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I only hear whatever he plays on a loop.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
It's about a 30-second loop that goes

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
for about a month and a half.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
On a scale of 1 to 10,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
just by guessing from meeting him

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
and hearing the sounds,

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
how spooktacular do you think they are?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
I don't know.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
I have to imagine a cheap haunted house

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
is a scarier haunted house.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
You've got less restrictions.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
I've been on the Batman ride

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
and the American Eagle at Six Flags

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
got America and Illinois.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
The Batman ride, they strap you in.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I've used this as a metaphor for things.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
There's something less scary

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
about having control totally taken from you

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
by a corporation.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
It's like, oh, you're strapped in.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Worst case scenario is this thing just kind of explodes

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
and it's no one's fault,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
but when you go on the American Eagle,

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
the world's oldest roller coaster,

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
which is just part of the psychological,

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
this is just a mind fuck.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
It's the world's oldest roller coaster.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
You're like, what?

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
It's made out of driftwood.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
It's washed over from Coney Island

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
that was already used for a worse roller coaster

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
that fell apart and that floated over

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
and found its way to the Great Lakes.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
They built a roller coaster out of it

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
and they strap a little jump rope across your lap

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
and ask you to hold it real tight.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
The reason that's terrifying is because

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
you can't let go of your sense of accountability.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Terror, and I think this maybe could be thematic

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
to our guests tonight,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I think a big part of terror is

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
how are you supposed to know

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
when you're really in trouble

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
and can you see death coming

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
and if you do, what are you supposed to do?

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
If a roller coaster starts to go wobbly,

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
is it going to be my fault if I die

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
because I didn't blah blah blah

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
or the people are going to be watching me

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
on a 4chan video, watching my head fly

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
and going like, look at the dick in the back

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
doesn't even move.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I think it's certainly not your responsibility

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
once that thing gets rolling.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
What a therapist would say.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
That's probably not what the theme park people would say.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
If you can blame a kid for getting eaten

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
by a fucking alligator at Disneyland,

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Jesus Christ, the ghost of that kid

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
was more vilified than Richard Nixon

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
because God forbid a fucking corporation admit

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
they had anything to do with a fucking alligator.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Fuck you.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
It's so fucking, and it's not Disney that I'm mad at.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Disney is a system.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
Its job is to not have a heart

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
or a brain or a soul.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Its job is to fucking keep existing.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
We have systems like that in place,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
like the alphabet and medicine

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
that we're very glad aren't like

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
only continued by someone's passion every day.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
So yeah, of course a fucking feeling-less system

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
should just keep going, you know,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
but that's why we have to be on our shit, you know?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Just to have a thing.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
There's a guy that says, like, you don't have to,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
it doesn't open you, it's not admissible in court

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
if you say sorry about the alligator.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
If the president has to visit a flood,

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
you know, otherwise he gets, you know, yelled at,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
like, you don't care about no flood,

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
like, well, somebody visit the fucking...

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Somebody...

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Just say you're sorry.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
What? It said don't go over there.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
It said don't go over there.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Was the alligator on the Disney park?

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Well, the alligator was on.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
In the water.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
That was a prime time alligator.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
What part of the park was...

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
He had a Mickey Mouse hat, though.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
No, he didn't have a Mickey Mouse.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
He had a band made, like, but in an area where

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
guests were supposed to keep out.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Was it part of the animal kingdom part of the park?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Like, it was part of the gators.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
It was swimming anyway.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Oh, yeah.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
It says no swimming.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Here's some other places you're not supposed to go

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
in Disneyland. The cash register.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Do you think they have more than signs

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
keeping you out of those fucking things?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Underground.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
They'll fucking cattle prod you.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
You try to stick your hand in the till.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Don't... Who cares if there was a goddamn...

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I don't care.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
What are the tickets to that place?

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
$8,000?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
The kid probably had to choose between college

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
and Disneyland before it could speak.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
They're like, I'm sorry.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
You're going to have to make this choice to hold

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
jangling a key chain with Mickey Mouse on it

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
and holding up one of those hats

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
that I'd know the name of if I went to college.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Mortar and Pestle.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
What are those things called?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Mortar board hat?

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
It's called a Mortar and Pestle.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
That's where you learn how to make...

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
You don't know, Mikey, but you're making a choice.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
You all live in the moment

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
or be an adult

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
with a stake in our workplace.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And the kid's like, I don't know.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
That mouse looks like...

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
It's so appealing

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
on an instinctive level

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
that for some reason

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
it's exempt from fucking

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
basic copyright law.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Didn't that thing become public domain

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
in like fucking 1990?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And then it was like...

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Obviously that doesn't count.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Mickey Mouse can't become public domain

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
just because it's older than fucking Huck Finn.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
That's not what we meant when we said that.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
We didn't mean that.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Is Dennis Hopper still alive?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Or if anybody we know that can do a perfect

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Dennis Hopper impression,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
I want to hear somebody reread what you just said

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
as Dennis Hopper.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
He's his mind, man.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
He's Mickey Mouse a good mouse.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
No.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
You think you're going on vacation, man?

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
You're going into a slaughterhouse.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Who's on the ride, okay?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
The kids or the fucking animals?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
That didn't sound like me.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
When we get into the frontier land,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Tomorrowland's gonna make

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Fantasyland look like

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Critter Country, man.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Critter Country.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Critter Country.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
They're written out of names that call lands Critter Country.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Well, I didn't finish my thought,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
but I know I've already harped on this,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
but I just want to finish that thought.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
It's not Disney that did or didn't do anything wrong.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Just the people in the comment sections, as always.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Stop sighting with a fucking inhuman system.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
It doesn't need your help!

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
If someone falls off a cliff while playing Pokemon Go,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
it's a tragedy!

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
A guy died!

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
You don't have to make a fucking point

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
about your priorities.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
You're like Paul bearing the American dream.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Piece of shit.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
You put on these masks,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
and you get on the internet,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
and you get...

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
What is it?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Sound effects?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Somebody's phone ring is Crickets.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Which is rude for two reasons.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
It's the bad place to go.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
It's bad?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Yeah, it's bad for a lot of things.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Well, there might be an emergency...

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Turn your phones off, but if it's on,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
make your phone ring laughter.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah, don't...

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I might forget to turn my phone off,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
so just in case I do,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I'll do a fail-safe here.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
My new ringtone...

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I don't know what it is.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I don't know what it is.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I'll do a fail-safe here.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
My new ringtone...

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
You suck!

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Now I'm protected.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I'm going to turn my phone on,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
and make it foghorn.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
All right.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I don't need to talk about

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
any of this other stuff.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
You just found out that...

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
What's happening?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Just keep it in your pants, buddy.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
He said

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Dennis Hopper.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I wanted to remind you

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
we were talking about Dennis Hopper.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Are you saying that you can do

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
a great Dennis Hopper impression?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
I already did.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
You did?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Let's hear it.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
That sounds a little bit more

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
like Bill Paxton from Aliens.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Don't put a nickel in that

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
side of the room anymore.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
That guy,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
the first thing he said was

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
you were kind of siding on the alligator side.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
You were like...

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
You brought up the sign.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
You were like, oh, it said no swimming.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
So, of course, if an alligator eats you,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
you deserve it.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
And then someone over there

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
with the cricket phone,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
and then back to you with this side of the room,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
just trouble, you know?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Just trouble.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Wait.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Spencer, come sit over with me.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
No, I'm good.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I'll show them.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Oh, yeah.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Thank you.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
You had a lot of shit in your plate.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
There was children, and there was...

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Yeah, I really...

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I think Cameron Esposito just said fuck it.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
She got two sentences into the haunted house

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
story, and she goes,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I want to go be with my wife.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Cameron was like,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
no, I could stay

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
and pluck my show, and then she said,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
are you sure I'm going to go and we're married?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Can you stay? Hey, I came late.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Maybe I'll leave late.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Okay, so about the haunted house,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
she's like, you know what?

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
The oven is on right now.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Can't blame her.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Can't blame her.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I was five seconds away

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
from doing the same thing.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
All right.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
So, yeah, I'm going to...

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Look, there's things that I...

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
I mean, look, it doesn't matter.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
We can talk to them. We can talk to them about anything.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Anyone.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
All right, I'm not going to...

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
I'm not going to tailspin interpreting that.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
You just like the show in general.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
That's what that meant. It wasn't...

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
You liked the part where I stopped being the only thing up here.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
I got my eye on you guys.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I can't see you.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
There's lights, but I got my eye on you.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
There are great guests.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Can we talk to Jane for a moment?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Because Jane has gifts for us.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Come on up, Jane.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Jane.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Oh, secret abscess.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Totally illegal.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
And I'm not sharing it with any of you.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Yeah, you're staying at my place,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
but you haven't seen me yet.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Whoa.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
That's how it is with all the ladies.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Let me know if I...

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Thank you.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Did you get in okay?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I got in okay. Thank you.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
What is it like staying at Shea Harmon

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
when it's just like...

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
It's a little weird, right?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Because you don't even see me.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
It's a small hotel.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
But it's like self-serve.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
It's like a Marriott Express.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
It's nice in that way.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I could hear that something was going on upstairs.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
It sounded very important.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
It was probably just the night of.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
It was like you're probably just listening to me

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
watching the night of.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Was that what it was?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
I was hungover in bed with Cody.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
We were watching that.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Okay, yeah.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
There was lots of voices and there was pregnant pauses

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
and then things were going on.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
But yeah, no, it's very nice.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Thank you.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
It kind of sounds like I murdered Cody.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
And I'm now not going to get away with it.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Which is a good time to...

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Is she back there?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Well, we'll find out.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
We haven't seen Cody for 72 hours.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Which is weird.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
We'll thank you so much, Jane.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
How are things going with you?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Are there any headlines?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Is there any drama in your life?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Anything we can consume?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I don't want to take time away from the guests.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I could go on with the drama.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I'm here for 24 hours.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Give us a little tease.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Just be like, I found a head in my trunk.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
And then just go sit out.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
And then we'll bring them up.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
That's a good cue for this.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Yeah, nothing like that.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Jane brought a bottle of absinthe for me today at the drawing room.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
And she also wanted to bring one

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
for Marilyn Manson, who's a big absinthe freak

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
who has his own absinthe.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
You called Manson.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
But you turned me on to that possibility.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Right.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
So we have now handed off your absinthe

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
to someone that will give Marilyn Manson

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
the absinthe of Malice that you make.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
That's my hope.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Do you think he'll talk about it on his blog?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Mansplaining?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Mansplainson.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Which I get so annoyed by,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
but it is his point of view.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Mansplaining.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I was proud of it.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Fuck you guys.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
It got all the applause it deserved.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Yeah.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
All right.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Well, we'll check in with you later.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Let's bring our friends out here.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I appreciate the gifts we've led you.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Also,

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Jane, I have your glass right here too.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Thank you so much.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Dan, do the honors for our guests.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Wait, what?

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I cut you off while you were about to intro our guests.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Okay.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Thank you. Sorry. It's like Thanksgiving dinner

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
and all of a sudden dad's like,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
you're time to cut the turkey.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
And I'm like, what?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Don't fuck this up.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
And then get your car keys in the footing.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Well, our guests are,

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I'm so stoked that we got,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I feel privileged that we could bag these guests

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
because I think there's probably a lot of people

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
that want to talk to them because they're,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
they've got this little hit podcast,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
My Favorite Murder.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
It's like meteorically popular.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Is it true that it's more popular than our podcast?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I have no idea.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I think it's a bigger hit than our own podcast.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I don't see the words.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I think we're doing ourselves a disservice

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
by even bringing these two out here.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Hold up that quarter of the hoopa.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
In a Jewish wedding

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
between the audience

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
and creatives.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I will hold up the

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
one of the two quarters.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
You and I are half a hoopa.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
That's our

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
promise to you.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
And we will sit

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
shiva for you.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Should the hoopa collapse

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
for you?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Maybe one of our guests is Jewish

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
and can help us out.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I know they're going to talk to us about murder

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
and podcasting.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I can almost be certain that

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
with a name like Karen Kilgariff,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
she has to be Jewish.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
She certainly has to host a podcast,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
a murder podcast.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Please welcome Karen Kilgariff

19:02.000 --> 19:08.000
and Karen Kilgariff.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Welcome.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Do you remember the last time I saw you, Karen?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I feel like it was decades ago.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Was it in that bar?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
And we were just talking massive shit

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
on that one person?

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Do you judge me for that?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
It's the way I live my life.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I listen to your podcast

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
and my girlfriend is how I found out

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
about it. She's such a huge fan.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I was like, oh, that's Karen.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I listened to it for a while.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I love her so much.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
She's really wise

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
and has always been an old soul.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I remember that conversation as you being

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
gentle and accepting and all that stuff

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
even though I felt like I was like

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
toxically bagging on a mutual friend

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
because I had axes to grind

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
that I was probably like 27

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
or something.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Who are you talking about?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Do you see what care we've taken?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
We are tiptoeing the shit out of this thing.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Knowing Karen though,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
she loved you even more because of that conversation.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Yes, because I'm filled with hatred.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
The thing that I liked about

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
that stuck with me was like,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I love Karen Kilgariff in that conversation

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
in spite of talking to who

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
you might have been a toxic turd

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
and the jury is still out.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
You were very forthcoming with

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
this very vulnerable part of your life

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
which I don't even know if you share that a lot

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
on your podcast.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
What did I say?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
You had an injury.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I wasn't sure if that was your

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
private life or something.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
You had bouts with epilepsy

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
where you would have these

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Russian novelist

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
seizures and wake up

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
and there would be blood everywhere.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
And an axe in my head?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
That's a Russian novelist.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
She was talking about Raskolnikov.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Cram and punishment, Jack, I got it.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Come on, grad students.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
That's a relief.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Are you still dealing with epilepsy?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Is that a thing that goes on for the rest of your life?

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
It is, but I take medicine

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
that controls it.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Do you have Raskolnikov-style seizures?

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Is that too literary?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
I actually don't know who that is.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I'm not going to pretend.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
My seizures are controlled

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
with medicine, but when I do have them

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
I believe they're

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
grandma. They're the big ones.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I just go for it.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
But that's the reason I stopped drinking.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
If you're going to go big.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Don't fuck around with seizures.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Put the pedal to the metal.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
When you have epilepsy

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
do you stop drinking

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
because

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
is it because

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
you'd be ill prepared to handle a seizure

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
if it happened or is it because it actually increases

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
the seizures?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
The funniest thing is when you have

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
a neurological problem, they have no idea

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
what they're talking about.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
They try to tell you things, but it's all,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
am I right?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Self-loathing neurologist.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Seventh year of grad school.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I don't know what I'm doing.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
But it really is all

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
theory.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
It's all theory.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
I was a huge drinker and drank every day

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
and night and had no problem

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
with it until I started having seizures.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
And then they said,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
you are having seizures because

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
from alcohol withdrawal.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
And I literally said to the doctor,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
but I've never stopped drinking.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Total honest,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
trying to solve the problem.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Obviously you know Dino because

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
you worked on Mr. Show.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
He used to be the Yoda of my drinking.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
He's the greatest.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
We were at the drawing room

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
yesterday at Saturday.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Saturday morning at the drawing room,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
you have these people that

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
they're called the zombies. They're the people that were

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
after hours on Friday night.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
And the drawing room opens at 6am.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
So they're there, but then also

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
maybe me and Dino and Jeff maybe.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
And Dino had this

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
conversation with one of them. It's like they really are

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
zombies. They've been partying

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
just straight through.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
And this guy was like, yeah, I'm really sorry, man.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I didn't, you know,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
look, he did one of those things.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I totally derailed what we were talking about.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I just wanted to say this one quote that that reminded me

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
of from Dino. He's talking to this guy.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
The guy goes like, man, I've been putting it for like 36 hours.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I was at after hours

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
and then it came here. And Dino said, yeah,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
we came here from bed. We're real alcoholics.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Anyone can go from drinking

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
to drinking. So easy.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I came here from the shower and I was like, I don't even

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
shower.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
We woke up and said, what's up?

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Let's go to the bar.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
And you're not like, what did I do? You're like, let's keep going.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
But you know, you're like, you're gonna make it happen.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
You're like, what am I going to do?

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Let's let's do it. Yeah, exactly.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
That's like, like, like,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
like Isaac Newton even said,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
like, if you're drinking and you keep drinking,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
that's nothing.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
That's like the fifth law of thermodynamics.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
He

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
called it no biggie.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Okay.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
So wait, why am I getting this out?

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Because I know everything.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
So I want you guys to guide the path here because

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I'm so fascinated with true crime

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
just as a human being.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I mean, I think we could just nerd out

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
about it a little bit and about murder itself.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
And of course, we're going to do that no matter what.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
But I'm super fascinated.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
But I have this problem.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I'm always running my mouth about gender and all this stuff

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
on the show and like prefacing it

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
by going like, of course, we're all equal

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
and there's no difference.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
And that's all stupid general statements and all that stuff.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
But this is fascinating role I feel like.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
And I think you guys have touched on it.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
And our mutual friend Kat Solin

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
is doing that other thing that's going to be

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
a true crime thing and like talking to her about it.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
It's like, there is this theme arising

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
that's like, well, okay,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
it's totally understandably

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
politically

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
not cool to imply that

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
women are wired differently at all.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And yet there is this beautiful

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
like

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
advanced state

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
that it seems like, I don't know,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
it just seems like women are more into true crime.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
And it seems like

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
now there's all these amazing true crime shows

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
happening because there's a generation

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
that's bringing it out of the gutter

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
and like they're making the dark chocolate,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
the artisanal true crime stuff.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Which is like,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
it's kind of like,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
okay, you don't have to be

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
you don't have to feel like it's a guilty pleasure

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
anymore. It's not like, oh,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I'm trapped in a trailer and I don't like myself

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
so I'm dwelling on the grisly details

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
of people, the only people worse off than me.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
And I'll just keep doing scratch-offs

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
and looking down on murder victims.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
We thought maybe

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
that's what it was, this tabloid-y,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
trashy thing.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
But I just, like now

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
it can be sophisticated

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
and now are we noticing,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
do you, you can

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
please tell me

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
gender means nothing, has nothing to do with this,

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
or tell me women are more into true crime for some awesome reason.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
I think saying gender is something

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
that's, and we are so different.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
We totally wire different.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
There's no shame to say that.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I know, but you know these fucking kids.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Jesus Christ. I know, everyone's

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
like to react. I know.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
But also it's good to be hard against somebody

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
a belushi like me going,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
if I start talking about gender, they're right to set up

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
players and be like, grandpa's talking about women.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Get a rope.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
It's just all, it's all about self-correction.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
It's like we fuck up all the time

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
on the, on the podcast. We say shit

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
because we're just talking. And then later on

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
people are like, hi, just to let you know

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
that was totally wrong and you're racist.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
And then we go like, sorry, that is not what we meant.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
We acknowledge it. We like

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
say beforehand, like trigger warning, like

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
if you're not okay with people being wrong all the time

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
then you're not gonna fucking like this.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
We should do that.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Yeah.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Definitely

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
trigger warning.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Don't listen to this podcast. Yeah.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I mean, honestly, just don't listen to it.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
But there is somebody on our Twitter page

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
that just, did you read that?

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
That somebody wrote an article about

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
exactly this thing, which is

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
why are women so into true crime.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
I'm very sorry that I don't know her name

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
offhand.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Man. But essentially

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
this is her, this is her article.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
It's really brilliantly written, but it's

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
when women watch true crime shows, say for example

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
they can picture themselves being the murderer

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
and the victim.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
And that's the thing where it's not that men

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
don't have bad things happen to them.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Now we have to do this. It's not that men

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
can't be hurt and you give so much

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
to the community. Bad things happen to men too,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
you guys.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
It happens.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
But with women

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
it's

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
you have mirror neurons you're experiencing

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
both positions.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
And I didn't even, when you said that

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I was like, aha, that's it.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
But I didn't even think it was like, oh, because of

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
the cultural ramifications of the whole glass ceiling

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
whatever, that you're always in true crime

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
you're the victim is usually a woman.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I wasn't, there's that too, but I was actually

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
going, aha, it is

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
that is a

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
mythically feminine characteristic

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
is just like, and

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
this could be just as much of a yoke

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
an infantilizing like sexist thing

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
to say, you're more intuitive

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
you're more, you're more acquiescent

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
you get it, you're better scanners when I lose

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
my car keys.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Those are all compliments.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I know, well

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
black people have big dicks as a compliment too.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
But it's also

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
look how they react, they've made it.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
It's also a way to

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
you know, you objectify, dehumanize

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
whatever. You're different, you're little

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
brains, you work different.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
But

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
I feel safe, which I

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
am safely on the side of

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
your big brains, they work different

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
because I think

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
I'm such a Campbell freak

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
and all of this, there's a meeting with the goddess

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
in mythology, at the bottom

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
as low as a hero

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
can go, and depths

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
not low as in down on his luck

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
low down into the

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
exploring the chaos and unconscious of the human condition

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
and beyond, a hero

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
comes to this point in the story

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
where it often involves

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
aqueous things, swampy

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
bogs and wells

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
and womb metaphors

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
and things, and there's a feminine

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
like energy to it, sometimes it's literally

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
a damsel in distress

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
or it's a witch, sometimes it's literally a woman

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
sometimes it's just a destination

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
or whatever, but it's like

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Campbell calls it the meeting with the goddess

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
and it almost feels like when I think of true crime

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
and I think about how when

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Kat Solin, our friend, when she talks

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
about murder

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
and why people are interested

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
in it, I'm like

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I just have to keep making her repeat it

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
because I can't repeat it, because I try to like repeat it

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
to other people and go like, well the thing about murder

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
is it's bad

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
and I'm like, Kat

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
what did you say Kat, what did you say?

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
and it's like she just remembers how

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
she's like, it has something to do with

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
people

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
who murder people

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
or they are

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
closer to death, when I say it

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
it sounds dumb, she

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
says this like amazing thing

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
they're grasping the fact that we're all

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
going to die and they're in control

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
of that death, so like

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
as someone who's had anxiety my entire life

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
and who's also been into true crime and death stories

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
my entire life, it's like

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
proving the fact that my anxiety is legitimate

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
but also at the same time making

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
me prepared on how

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
to avoid certain situations where I could get killed

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
I feel like

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
we're talking about trigger warnings, we're talking about

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
all this stuff, these highway cones and all these things

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
your show is like, part of it is

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
people trust you guys, like

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
whatever that thing is that made me feel

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
when I heard your name again

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
oh fuck, she thinks I'm a piece of shit

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
from 20 years ago, you have some

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
essence about you

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
you're a sage person

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
you're very put together

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I feel like there's not a lot of shit people could throw at you

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
you'd slip up and reveal

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
that you had some fucked up

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
value system

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
people trust you

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
and Georgia, whatever

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
you know, come on

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
how did you guys

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Georgia and Karen get together on this

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
what was the nexus of you guys starting

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
we have to make a podcast

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
about true crime

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
the short

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
version is, we were at a party together

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
and I was telling

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
a terrible story about a terrible

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
violent thing

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
that I witnessed, which was at the

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
South by Southwest, I think it was now three years ago

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
were the car killed everybody?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
yeah, I was on the street

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I was a couple blocks away from this

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
really? I was the last person in line

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
and I fucking love telling stories like this

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
and I never get the response I want

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I was the last person in line

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
and then

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
my friends had walked away to the front

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
because X was playing and they walked up

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
to hear X and then I was like

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
oh fine, why am I waiting in line

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
and I walked up and I walked up to say

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
let's not wait in line, let's just stand out here

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
and that fucking car came broke through the barrier

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
plowed through like 30 people

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
thank god my back was to

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
the crowd, but I mean we were

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
we were mere feet away

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
and I told that story at a party

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
at a Halloween party where most people

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
had eaten a lot of edibles

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
and so everybody around me

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
just kind of went gray

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
and it was like what?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
and then she from like

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
two people back was like wait, tell me the story

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
and like her eyes were like

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
I was dressed like Glenn Danzig too

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
at the Halloween party

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
and I was like what the hell

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
tell me everything

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
did you wear shorter shoes so you could be tiny?

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
had cat litter with me too

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
so that zeal

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
and that

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
the trust or whatever

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
if that's the combination whatever it is

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
is true crime in general

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
is it a safe place

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
from this sort of from our

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
our anxiety about

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
political correctness and stuff because it's simultaneously

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
what could be more sensitive

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
than caring if people got killed

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I mean you guys aren't

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
the insane clown posse, you're not using

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
fear to like

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
to make music?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
look how not scared we are open

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
you're going like oh look at this

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
terrible thing when you indulge in

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
true crime but it's also

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
unmistakably

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
like it's not

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
you can't dress it up

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
as noble

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
it's real people, real people have died

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
and like we're there is on our

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Facebook page there was a woman that got on

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
insisting that she was a fan insisting

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
and it was like a thread

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
that went probably like almost

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
300 comments this woman going

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
look I'm a huge fan of the podcast

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I'm just saying isn't this exploitation

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
isn't this the worst thing you could do

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
and she was arguing with every and people

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
come on and go I really don't think that's the way they're doing it

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
but isn't this entertainment at the cost

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
of a person who died

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
isn't this and she just kept arguing it

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
and finally I went on and I said

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
you're using this word entertainment

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
as if it's all fun

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
a day at the carnival and

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
although this is entertainment to me

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
what it actually is

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
is maybe going into the reality

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
of being murdered

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
being the person that's in the apartment

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
when some fucking dude walks in

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
the family of the fucking people who have to deal

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
with this murder that like isn't going to go to trial

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
because they never find the fucking

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
the killer or they or it goes to trial

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
and they get fucking off in five years

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
the other part of our friendship that I think brings a lot

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
to this is that we kind of

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
bonded over vulnerability

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
being a thing off Brene Brown

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
thank you fucking god

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
when we became friends it was like

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
in this like idea of being super vulnerable

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
around each other and I think talking about

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
how much we're fascinated and scared

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
and have anxiety over

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
true crime and depression

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
is like big part of it

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
so you weren't friends until that night when you guys

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
met at that party and talked about that

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I think we had met like once before but we didn't

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
like hang or but there was not a bond

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
so that's your origin story not just the podcast

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
but if you guys being like a duo

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
like a friendship yes that's great

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
we meet over at lunch

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
and talk about our favorite truth

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
the conversation would go that way

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
can I ask you a question

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
what do you think about Nancy Grace

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I think she is bad

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
for journalism

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I think she is

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
the fact that she focuses

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
it's like any small

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
blonde anything that dies

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
that's when she jumps in front of that camera

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I rarely see her talking

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
about people of race and color

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
which is so many of these murders

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
the more research we do

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
there's that real creepy

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
and this is what we're talking about

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
these are the things we're stumbling on

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
as genuine amateurs

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
when you talk about women

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
of color who are murdered

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
their cases you've never fucking heard of

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
even if you think you're the true crime expert

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
there's like Georgia did one about a murder

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
in DC that was just like

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
it was a bunch of very young black girls

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
and it's like not BTK

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
and it's certainly not Jombani Randy

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Nancy Grace gets vehement about

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
like Jodi Arias

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
I don't even know what the fuck that was

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
except for that she was

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
blonde before and then a brunette

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
afterwards

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
because of Nancy Grace

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Nancy Grace said I like brunettes

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
I also think that when you get that

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
definitive about your opinions

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
about what happened and you get that

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
definitive about what's wrong

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
I think when we talk about these

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
true crimes it's exploring

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
it's exploring the murders and exploring

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
the crime instead of just being like

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
here's what fucking happened and period

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
well isn't that as we

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
make true crime

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
classier in this golden age of TV

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
now and I'm not counting

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
one of your favorites the OJ

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
thing which I love too

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
that felt delightfully

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
that felt delightfully tabling

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Georgia called it The Simpsons

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
The Simpsons

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
You're still the Juice Juice

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Uncle Juice

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Uncle Juice

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I was just listening to you guys talking about

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
do you think what killed him is having to say

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Uncle Juice that many times

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
and like sell it

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
he got Uncle Juice Cancer

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
but talking about

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
the idea that we could make it

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
get past the reenactment footage with the strobing

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
and the male voiceover

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
going like what she didn't know

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
was murder

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
which those always involve

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
a red lace bra

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
if you're obsessed with any of those shows

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
with reenactments talk about exploitive

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
for 15 years

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Keith Harrison was that ghoulish

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Keith Morrison

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
ooh I hate him

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I love him

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Is that 2020 or what is that

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Dateline

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
20 Dateline

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I think it's a Dateline 20s

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
if it's him doing it I can't watch it

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
even though I love true crime

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
and murder of the weak shit

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
I can't do it because he's such a shitty writer

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
well and also he's selling that

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
first of all his nose is very sharp

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
and then he's kind of like

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
he's like staring the camera down like a weird snake

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
where you're like okay just move on

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
but did he know

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
that when she left that would be the last time

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
or did he know that he was going

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
stop asking questions cocksucker

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
you're the fucking journalist give me some answers

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
we don't know

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
also those shows like

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
when they cut back from a commercial break

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
the first half of it is catching you up

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
of what you already fucking saw

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
that show should be 20 minutes

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
so isn't what's for sale there

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
when you flock to true crime

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
because you're like oh a death happened

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I want to know details

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
we are conditioned to be a little bit ashamed of that

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
there's a little bit of like

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
because you're rubber necking on the freeway

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
you're slowing down traffic

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
don't you understand it's your patriotic duty

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
for your species to not be fascinated

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
with the innards that are squirting out

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
of someone that has suffered this horrible fate

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
it's not the fireworks for you

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
you're a terrible person

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
but underneath that is this

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
insidious message of like

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
that is then carried through by serial killers

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
who do these like interviews and they go like

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
I'm a super being because everyone else is ashamed

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
of this stuff and it's like well wait a minute

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
what if we weren't

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
and are we because it should be because

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
when people die and we want to know details

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
and when it's weird that people died

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
I'm so terrified right now

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
thank you sir

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
that could have been a knife

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
what the fuck are you doing

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
you just stood there

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
you sat there

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Jesus

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I don't know it's super weird

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
this dude walked up and really slowly

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
stabbed Georgia and Karen

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
and Dan is weird

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Georgia and Karen you guys

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
you said that as a woman

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
you're watching this and that women

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
you think feel that you can put yourself

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
more in the shoes of the killer and the victim

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
as well

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
how much of it because I watch it

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
is this the same for you too

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
you start trying to craft in your own mind

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
how you would have done it

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
what part of it is like I'm going to kill somebody

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
and all I need is like

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
a backyard

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
what did the opposite where I'm like how would I fucking karate

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
chop this dude who's trying to kill me

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
his parkouring into my fucking apartment

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
and there's a deeper thing there too

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
which is I believe

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
I've been trying to ask

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
my first question

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
and that's on me not anyone else

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
it's

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
aren't we actually

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
kind of memorializing

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
and also honoring

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
isn't our

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
because fucking giraffes don't do it

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
that's for sure

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
and baboons

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
if a person dies

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
the weirder the accident

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
the murder

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
our desire for details

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
that we call ghoulishness

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
it's just a human reaction

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
we're reaching our little tendrils out

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
and we're like to a wound

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
and we're going like

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
okay here's the threshold

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
the threshold has opened up between life and death here

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
and not through the way that have been

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
co-opted and systematized by pharmaceutical companies

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
and hospitals and everything

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
where you don't deal with death

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
we think of death as a disease

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
and one that's weirdly

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
that people

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
we have this crazy relationship

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
or lack of with death

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
and when people are so but we still

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
have

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
someone got impaled

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
with a stop sign and we're just like

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
how does that happen

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
where was he going how much he had

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
how can I not

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
and if it was going to happen to me

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
how would I know it was about to happen

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
one of the first things we ever talked about

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
remember last Halloween

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
or the one before

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
when that guy got in that car accident

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
on the 5 and he ended up

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
it cut in half and up on the exit sign

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
in Glendale

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
it was so intense

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
it's horrible

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
I did not come here for this

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
but it is this like

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
he landed on the sign

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
he was speeding and he was being

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
he was like driving past people

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
it was a horrible horrible thing all together

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
but I mean how many times have you driven

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
in LA on a freeway going like 95

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
because everyone else is going 95

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
and going how is this going to end

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
I'm in a tin box driving

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
95 this could go

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
really badly but it went really badly

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
for that guy

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
how do you not look at that

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
that guy's decision

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
and I think what I concentrate on

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
and I don't murder so much is that

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
it's not fucking fair like you're living your life

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
you're going to college or you're trying to

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
live your own life

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
and then some fucker comes and takes it away from you

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
and he's just some fucking idiot drug addict piece of shit

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
and it's just so unfair

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
it bothers me so much so I want to read about it

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
and find out what their experience was

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
and find out what their family's experience was

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
because their entire circle

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
of people that they know and have cared about

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
and have cared about them

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
their lives are fucking changed forever

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
and they watch all the forensic files

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
and date lines in 2020s and all that stuff

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
and any movie about it

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I hate the journalism

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
because

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
but he was being

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
he was being so cold

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
and not emotional when it was happening

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
but my girlfriend we were watching the staircase again

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
and apparently

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
everybody gets volume but their lawyers are like

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
here take a bunch of volume whenever you're being interviewed

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
so that you seem

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
like so you don't overreact

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
is that a 911 call thing

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
where it's like I panic so much

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
like Gone Girl was

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
like my worst nightmare

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
like the first act of it

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
because it was like

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
it plugged into my fear

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
that I would wake up one day

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
and something with some weird thing

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
would have befallen a loved one

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
and that everyone would start really scrutinizing me

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
they will

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
and then

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I've turned

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
my

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
you talk funny, you act weird

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
you have inappropriate reactions into a fucking goldmine

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
but

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
on the playground

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
when I was in 6th grade

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
and if my wife got murdered

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
it would be

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
back up to life and death stakes

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
people going like

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
we still haven't seen Cody for 72 hours

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
and people going like

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
so here's your 911 call

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I had one

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
with a guy that had a bad accident

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
and I tripped over his leg

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
and it was gone

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
and I was like

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
something clicked inside of me

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
that sealed off all kind of processing

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
of the viscera

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
thank god because if I can't watch

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
I have to go like this when people

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
shoot up in Tarantino movies

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I can't

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I can't stand the

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Dan Ackroyd Julia Child sketch

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
where he cuts his finger

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
and when I talk about it I get nauseous

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
and when I give blood I have to turn my head

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
and they always have to ask if I'm okay

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
because I get lightheaded

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
but I tripped over a guy's

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
severed leg and I

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
didn't save his life or anything

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
but I was James Bond until the paramedics got there

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
I didn't do anything right

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
but I was like

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I didn't faint or puke

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
my point was

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
if I'm calling 911

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
because if you and I are together

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
wrapped around your neck and kills you

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
and I hear tires screeching

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I feel like I'm going to

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
get the belt under your purple

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
and the recording is going to be me going like

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
yeah

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
I was drinking with my friend

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
and a belt wrapped around her neck

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
and she's dead and you should hurry

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
you should hurry sir

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
what's going on where are you

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
you should hurry up and arrest me

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
because I'm going to the big house

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
and it's never like

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
a relationship between people that

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
behave that way

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
well I think they're starting to realize that now

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
that whole thing of like he didn't react

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
correctly he was very cold

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
women get that all the time

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
if it's some mother whose child died

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
she must have done it because she wasn't crying

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
in public

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
I just heard the theory that a lot of times the lawyers

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
they give you sedatives

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
because they don't want you overreacting

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
to the police or to the prosecutors

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
and then they can't anticipate what the press

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
does I've never heard that

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
and that's why they're not relying on witness testimony

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
as much because it's so fucking flawed

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
from our memory to the way we react

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
is so different from person to person

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
there's no way to read into that stuff

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
what's your guys' most

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
if you had to pick one murder

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
mystery trial or thing

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
that is the most

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
the one that you fascinate on the most

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
one, two, three

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
John Wayne Gacy

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
wait did you say John Benet and John Wayne Gacy

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
at the same time?

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
we are so close

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
John Benet Gacy

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
he's the bass player for Marilyn Manson

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
John Benet Gacy

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I heard it was Jane Cook's absence

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
that made him commit all those crimes

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
you can read all about it on mansplaining

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
a joke I came up with

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
that's Marilyn Manson's blog

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
mansplaining

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
I thought it was pretty funny

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
did I have something to do with it?

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
with naming it

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
I wrote the joke

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
I came up with it

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Georgia

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Georgia you were John Benet

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
man I am fascinated

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
didn't they get back in the news

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
there's about to be a big

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
documentary series

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
documentary series about it

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
are there new revelations in the John Benet?

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
supposedly

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
they like to promise that in the promos

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
you have to wait until the very end

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
to find out that nothing is happening

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
we don't know anything

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
which I love

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
I love not knowing because

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
my thing is I'm really into cold cases

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
because you don't find out it's a dick lick

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
drug addict who killed her

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
it's a bigger mystery

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
maybe it's this diabolical thing

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
instead of it's like this ass hole

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
got drunk and killed this woman

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
who was better than him

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
and he took it away

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
so I like unsolved shit

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
I hate when it's like a cold case

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
and then

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
I love when it's a police officer

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
an investigator

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
that finds out oh shit

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
I just never gave up on this

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
and then one day I went back through all the shit

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
and I found a lot of it now

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
oh now we have modern DNA stuff

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
but I like when someone goes no

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
no one ever looked at this one statement

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
it was this guy

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
I love that stuff

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
and you start thinking about how often it must happen

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
because for so long

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
before there were computers or whatever

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
and it was just up to whatever

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
if a policeman was thorough

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
then things would all get checked

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
and if someone was a little sloppy for whatever reason

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
or the policeman didn't have taught

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
he was the only fucking detective in that

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
unit and the other thing is DNA evidence

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
isn't fucking final anymore

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
there was some case

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
in Michigan and they tested

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
the DNA on this cold case and on her jacket

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
and the DNA they found on the jacket

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
was from a perpetrator

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
who was in prison but was four years old

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
when the time of the crime took place

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
so like clearly

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
did he borrow her jacket?

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
he did not borrow her jacket

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
she was uh

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
oh god damn it

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
what do you call the guy that does the bris?

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
a moll

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
she was a moll

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
and wore that jacket

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
do you guys know about the

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
you know the house on Franklin

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
is it Frank Lloyd Wright or Lloyd Wright?

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
yes I know

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
I just did something at that house

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
where I got to go to the house for the first time

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
I was shooting some stupid thing and it went down

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
there's a secret room did you guys have a secret room?

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
I found out it was a secret room

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
wait did you see the secret room?

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
well it's walled off now I think

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
and there's a guy

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
on the other side of the wall

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
he's going like I did it

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
I killed the black doll you see

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
I never know who I am

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
I'm the bee's knees for killing the black doll

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
it's very authentic

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
you can tell he hasn't been out of there

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
the guy that owned that house was a physician

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
a doctor

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
he raped his daughter

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
and supposedly did it but then he died

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
so we'll never know

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
he's not the killer

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
but supposedly they brought in

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
when they were trying to resell Frank Lloyd Wright's awesome house

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
they're on Franklin and whatever it is

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Winona-ish

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
they brought cadaver dogs in

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
and they all hit on the same room

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
wait but it wasn't the secret room

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
it was a different room

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
but he also performed

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
like secret abortions in that room

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
that's why they thought he was attached to the doll

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
did I go somewhere dark?

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
you didn't do it?

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
she's not the secret abortionist

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
you guys have a murder show

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
that was too much

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Karen you're a John Wayne Gacy guy

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
John Wayne Gacy

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
it's so funny

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
there's no way this was from my grammar school

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
but I have this memory of being in the library

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
of my grammar school and opening up a book

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
about John Wayne Gacy

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
and I went to Catholic school so there's no fucking way

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
I was in school

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
but I was somewhere and I opened up a book about John Wayne Gacy

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
and there was

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
an illustrated drawing

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
of where the bodies were

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
in the house

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
and someone just

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
oh yeah yeah yeah

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
that was self-loathing neurologist from over here

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
oh that's right

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
she's just catching up

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
there were so many drawings

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
and it was like underneath it said

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
there were 37 boys

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
or I can't remember if that's the correct total

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
but somewhere around in the 30s

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
and it said found

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
the way they explained it in the house

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
but I thought it meant in the walls

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
and then the way it was drawn

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
it looked like there were

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
people in the walls

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
there at the picture for 10 minutes

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
and before that point in my life

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
I thought everybody

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
was living the exact same life I was living

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
I thought everybody was middle middle class

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I thought everybody had

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
two parents in their house

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
I had no fucking clue

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
what the real world was like at all

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
so it was this real

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
amazing it was like an epiphany

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
but the scary version of an epiphany

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
because I suddenly was like

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
there are grown men out there

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
with boys and put them in the walls of his house

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
but if you hide enough boys

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
in the walls think of the savings

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
on heating cars

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
they are the perfect

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
because they have a vacuum inside of them

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Jeff

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
when you

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
think of the savings

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
why can't we

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
I like the savings

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
when you fixate on the John Wayne Gacy murders

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
so you've probably fixated that

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
on the timelines

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
he's still alive right

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
John Wayne Gacy, he died in jail

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
but after a long while

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
over and over again

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
it's like a rare case of a fountain

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
of knowledge about

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
John Wayne Gacy because he just hung out

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
and kept answering questions

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
and then what

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
and I've read some of that stuff

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
so when you're reading those accounts

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
he kept bringing boys back

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
to his house and then

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
to talk about magic

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
the big thing was

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
the rope trick

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
the handcuff trick

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
when you're hearing that story

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
that for me

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
I'm pouring over that

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
and I'm like

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I am thinking

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
of

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I think I'm getting a glimpse of

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
victim and murderer

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
because

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
the murderer is a boy

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
maybe

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
but I also

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
maybe that's just like

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
do you detect a difference there

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
because the victims are

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
a different gender

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
because that would be valuable data

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
in my dumb thesis from earlier

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
I guess

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
in this case I didn't just because

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
they kept using the word boy

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
so it felt like

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
my school

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
a man murdered boys

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
that would be my age

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
and put them in his house

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
and like what the fuck are we talking about right now

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
it was like getting secret documents

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
but it was just like this book

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
but also

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
what I immediately also went into

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
is like that moment where he's

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
it's the guy that owns the construction company

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
who says hey you did good work today

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
I'll buy you a beer come over to my house

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
we have a whole beer and all the guys come

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
you'll have a great time

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
so you fucking go because you're 16

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
and you're broke and you want to get drunk

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
oh my god the places I went

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
when I was 20

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
with dudes 3 times my age

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
that I looked up to

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
and then when you're there

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
in John Wayne Gacy's den

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
it goes from a super fun cool chill

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
everyone's drunk

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
to let me do the handcuff trick

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
and suddenly your handcuffed

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
and then the bottom fucking drops out

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
and reality switches

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
and it turns into a nightmare

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
but it's still reality

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
that I fixate on

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
and can't get over

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
another you guys talked about

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
we started watching this show

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
because you talked about it on your podcast

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
I survived

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
have you guys seen the show

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
fuck me

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
oh my god

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
the woman who

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
there's an episode

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
that we went through

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
we looked for it first

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
that's the hitchhiker

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
I don't even know

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
why I brought it

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
because

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
that's a person that survived

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
so when you guys are consuming

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
that

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
they're sitting these people and they're the victims

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
and they survived

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
and then they're talking to the camera

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
and they're taking you through

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
every granular detail

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
of an experience that absolutely

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
should have definitely

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
they should not be telling

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
and

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
and so what are we feeling

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
when we're watching that?

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
I will tell you this

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
my sister forced me

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
to watch I Survived one time

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
and I was like I don't want to watch this

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I don't want to get involved in this

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
do not make me and she was like

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
no I swear to god you'll love it

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
and basically made me

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
I was at her house so I couldn't change the channel

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
and she forced me to watch it

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
and so what I'm saying to those

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
is it is the survivor

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
talking slightly off camera

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
to you saying here's what happened to me

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
and as upsetting as it is

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
and insane as it is

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
and there's all kinds of

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
it's not all just these murder attempts

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
or hideous things there's also like

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
there's always some fucking Australian that's like

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
I hike too far up in the mountains

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
shut the fuck up

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
my girlfriend and I are absolutely

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
I mean that's like

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
you're leeching to your surface

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
because you're like you know

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
it became the running joke

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
we're like mocking the Australian that survived a forest fire

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
like there's a lady with her arms and legs cut off

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
you boo

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
that guy chose to go fucking hiking

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
when this chick's like I was walking on the sidewalk

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
and you're like well that didn't you know

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
you weren't like fucking or hitchhiking in the 70s

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
which was like yeah clearly fucking stupid

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
they thought it was like driving

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
but you know the Australian girl that survived

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
a forest fire like they pulled up in their van

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
and we're like you survived

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
let's talk about it and she's like really oh well

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
okay and they're like which episode should we put her in

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
they fucking hung her out to dry

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
well but the other thing that I love

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
that that showed to me

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
the total lack of exploitation

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
is those survivors are telling

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
their own story and almost

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
every time at the end

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
it's some badass woman who's like

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
and then he shot me in the head three times

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
and you're like I'm sorry what the fuck is happening

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
and it's a person

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
these people all different types of people

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
surviving gunshots to the head

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
or being brutally

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
fucking raped and dumped into a ditch

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
or whatever it is and they're sitting there

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
as a whole person telling you what happened

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
to them and saying like I know you didn't

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
mean it this way but like giving voice

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
to a story that nobody wants to hear

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
and being like that's my experience

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
that's why I walk can you then they like

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
show the fucking scar on their

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
neck or whatever it is and at the end

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
usually they've set up some foundation

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
to help victims almost every time

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
it's some badass woman who's like

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
and now I run the crisis center

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
for all the women

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
she does

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
fucking do it

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
that's right well I think that's so much of the murder

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
thing that I'm fascinated by and I think women too

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
because like we're so empathetic and like overly so

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
that like

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
we see this we see like

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
these murders and like

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I think a murder is about to happen

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
it could happen any time

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
it could happen any time

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
I'm on your side

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
it makes perfect sense we understand what you're saying

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
you're saying protect stop killing women

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
all the time

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
please stop killing women

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
I'm sorry to laugh out loud

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
she's pleading too Jeff please stop killing women

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
I don't know if that is true

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
I think look

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
yes am I still under indictment

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
yes but

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
I went golfing recently

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
with my friend Kato Kailin Danza

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
friend

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
this is not a joke

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
we've known Kato for a long long time

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
he is the nicest guy

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
the most lovely, sweetest

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
pleasantest

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
this goofiest, funniest

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
he's so much fun to be around

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
he was in the Simpsons

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
he was in the Simpsons

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
but I've known him for a good

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
long time and we sat down one time

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
maybe we talked about in the show before

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
he told me the whole story

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
about everything that he knew would happen that day

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
when the murders happened

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
oh Jay did it

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
what

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
spoilers

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
look

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
if you want

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I feel like I told the story

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I can tell you what he told me

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
but the other day

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I haven't seen him in a year or two

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I'm a terrible golfer

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I suck at golfing

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
and I had an old ratty ass golf glove

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
with holes in it

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
look at this thing

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
one of my golf clubs

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
had been in the car for a while

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
it was kind of like tar

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
coming off of the grip

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
so it turned all black

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
and he made the joke to cut everybody off

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
at the pass like just don't leave it on the ground

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
so somebody finds that glove

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
I'm like what? and everybody laughs

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
oh right the glove

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
and he goes Jeff every time I go golfing

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
somebody does that joke

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
he'll be out golfing

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
and someone will take the glove off

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
throw it in a bush

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
he says every day of his life

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
for the last 15-20 years

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
however long it's been

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
when I first met him it had been about 12 years

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I think since the murder

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
10

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
he said every single day somebody comes up

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
and says some horrible shit

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
he was friends with Nicole

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
and he was kind of like this baby sitter

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
with his kids because he was

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
he was just a baseball playing

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
surfing dude

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
he's like the guy that was out in the guest house

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
to be in that scenario

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
that he was in

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
it's like one of those things where

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
then suddenly that's your whole life

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
he didn't want to be a witness

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
he told me

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
I was hanging out in the guest house

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
and OJ never came down to the back house

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
never spoke to him

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
but he also felt like OJ would fall him around

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
OJ was having people tail him

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
because he was super jealous of Nicole

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
and Kato was never fucking Nicole

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Nicole was doing her own thing

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
but Kato, if you've ever seen him

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I've been around him like at parties

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
like at Fourth of July parties and stuff like that

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
and he is like this awesome baby sitter

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
the kids love him

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
and he's got the energy of a toddler

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
and he just runs around and piggyback rides

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
and he is the best

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
he was portrayed very well in The Simpsons

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I disagree

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I actually broke my heart

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
because of having met him

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
he seemed like a kind person

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
who didn't have any fucking feelings

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
but they still kind of bimboized him in a way

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
he wanted nothing to do with it

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
and his nervous tension of being up there

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
and not knowing anything

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
he came off like he was just being giggly

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
but it was that generation's first Hollywood murder

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I mean we hadn't had

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
a black dolly or anything

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
and now we had cameras

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
and there was a racial component

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
that was a celebrity murder

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
and he represented

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
this new

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
it was like this amazing thing

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
he had a mullet

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
and he was living in the guest house

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
it was the Midwest's

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
introduction to

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Hollywood

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
and he's from Milwaukee

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
that was a big part of it too

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
like in Milwaukee, birthplace of Jeffrey Dahmer

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
like we were

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I guess we had a personal stake in the OJ thing too

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
that actor staying in the guest house

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
anyways

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I want to go to bedrock

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
because we're talking about

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
true crime

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
grizzly murders

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I don't even know what the statistics are

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
I'm going to assume 99.9%

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
the victims are women

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
the perpetrators are

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
men

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
do we

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
you guys

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
consuming this on a junky level

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
you already stumbled into

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
the class system thing

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
it's like blonde and blue eyes

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
we heard what you said

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
you stumbled into that

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
have you reached any conclusions

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
or had any changes of heart

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
or new affirmations of

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
and I'm not even sure how to pose the question

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
are we doing things

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
from the world of the sane

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
to indoctrinate women

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
into

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
a victim culture

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
are we all

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
participant in some kind of

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
is that a real thing

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
do we somehow

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I think there's a way that that could be

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
true in some general

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
in some general swaths

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I'm definitely not educated enough to speak

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
on this except for

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
an alligator we tend to

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
blame the kid

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
we tend to figure out why it's not that

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
bad an alligator and not that bad

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
of a corporation and I'm sorry but

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I'm trying to be Jonom Chomsky about it

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
but we have a bias there

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
if somebody gets killed

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
by a lawnjerk we tend to side

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
with the lawnjerk

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
especially if it means lawnjerk get recalled

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
we go like another fucking piece of

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
apple pie in americana

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
what are you talking about

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I'm talking about lawnjerk

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
what are lawnjerk

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
we're a deadly weapon

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
that used to be able to play with

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
oh lawnjarts

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
with a J

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
you could throw a javelin at your friends

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
and it would land in somebody's throat

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
and kill them

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
so they did two rounds of these

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
they did lawnjarts and then lawndarts

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
and they were like we gotta stop with lawn

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
it was like if you played

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
cornhole the beanbag game

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I know all about lawndarts I did not know about lawnjarts

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
that's crazy

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
1980 when were you born

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
they were giant lead poles

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
with plastic fins on them

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
that were designed for airtime

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
and for penetrating the human skull

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
right so anyways

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
we tend to side

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
against the victim so I think

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
that it's even before you get into

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
gender politics it's like

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
the potential for bias

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
exists in this like where is

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
it coming from and what is it

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
personally I think it's the journalism

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I think it's what story sells

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
and what's the most exciting

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
you have a child that's

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
in beauty pageants

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
it's a 6 year old dressed up as a 35 year old secretary

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
and she is murdered

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
we've been talking about it

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
for 20 years

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
and that's because that is the ultimate

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
that the news can bring that up and sell

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
2 million magazines easy

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
you see it constantly it's like in touch

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
once a month has a jambanay story

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
and it's the oldest story there is

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
part of the fascination with that is that it was a fucking rich

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
a rich white family

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
and so like

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
part of the reason it's never been solved and was such

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
a big deal is because those people got away

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
with it because they were a rich white family

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
but within that

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
certainly if it bleeds it leads

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
while we're leading the bleeding

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
are we also

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
lacing everything

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
with some kind of fiber optic cable

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
that sends the message that

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
you know

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
well she left her house

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
and isn't that

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
doesn't it just come back to

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
it's a holdover from

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
television as I've always said

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
it's an appliance

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
if you talk to your refrigerator it'll tell you

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
nothing's cold enough and that's not true

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
if you talk to your toaster it'll tell you

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
all bread should be

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
crispy and hot and brown

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
and that's not necessarily true

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I like it's attitude

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
it's just that the television happens to be able

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
to talk to you

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
and does its job as a appliance

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
and the television would tell you

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
not enough people are sitting right in front of me

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
glued to me afraid to ever

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
stop watching me and

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
is that and not so much

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
of course a big help and heapen of misogyny

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
because it's the oldest

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
the actual world's oldest profession

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
hating women

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
you can't beat the hours

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
but

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
it could be just like a thing

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
it's like maybe we can break out of it

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
because that's really

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
specifically about a

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
time

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
broadcast era thing of

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
just be afraid to stop watching your TV

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
ladies be afraid to

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
because this lady left when she stopped watching

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
your TV and she got her head cut off

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
I think because we're not experts

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
and we're not journalists and all we can do

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
is like impart our experiences

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
and part of that is

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
it's so hard to walk the line between

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
victim blaming and telling women

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
you can tell someone to fuck off

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
before

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
they fucking talk to you and you can fucking pepper

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
spray someone before they try to talk to you

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
you don't have to be fucking polite

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
and it's all we can

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
there's I've been in instances where like

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I should have fucking been killed or I shouldn't

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
have been so nice and it's all I can do is say

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
my experiences with that which is

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
is that women

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
are taught to fucking be polite

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
and smiley and cute and fucking

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
accessible there's so many minute by minute

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
repercussions for not being

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
like a perfect little

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
angel that has her perfect social network

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
arranged around her you're going to get punished

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
for that in ways if you live

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
what's beautiful is first of all

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
we know now television is a dying art

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
and that we know that the children of today

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
are online and they're

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
kind of like making their

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
they're forging their own path so they're not

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
in the same way that I feel like I was

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
anyway taking this stuff in

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
like just whole cloth

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
and just accepting whatever they see where it's

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
like oh yeah I better be scared or whatever

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
there's so many more

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
I feel like there's so much more

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
independent thinking when people get

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
on even when it's Facebook like on our

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Facebook page people will fight for

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
seven days about something to go back

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
and forth and that's because it's the

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
kind of love of the discussion

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
and there really is stuff that gets

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
said and learned I think

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
and I think these days people aren't so

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
maybe

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
as willing to just be like accepting

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
of that like most people don't

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
the whole idea of like

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
oh it can't be rude or someone's going to think

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I'm a bitch or resting bitch face or any of that stuff

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
it's like well I think that's cool

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
I love resting bitch face

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I think it's hilarious and I think you can

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
get a lot done with it and resting bitch face

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
comes from years and years of being barbarded

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
with people when you fucking men

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
when you fucking smile at them they think it's an open

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
invitation to talk to you

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
men are allowed to have resting bitch face at all time

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
and it looks aloof

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
what are you the manager of a bank

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
oh

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
cunt

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
oh I'll give you all my money

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
now we see

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I'm so fascinated

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I mean I can't get enough of Ryan Lochte

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
in the news because

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I love that's Colbert and

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Trevor Noah and everybody is just taking

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
a thousand tons of shit on this

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
this dumb dumb

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
if he kills somebody

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I'll watch that forever

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
if we

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
find out that he ever just like murdered a puppy

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
that'll be news because

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
he's just so dopey

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I love watching

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
like entitled

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
rich like protected

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
assholes just getting trouble

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
he won gold medals then he peed

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
on a shell station in Brazil

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
and then he didn't have to go on

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Matt Lauer and talk about it he could have gone home

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
they fucking

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
that's that Olympic thing

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
the only thing I've heard about that was

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
this hilarious comedy of errors that all had to do with

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
you were telling me about that

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
he told his mom

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
and then his mom talked to the thing

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
and they followed up on the story

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
he didn't report it

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
his mom reported it from America

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
she probably don't talk to my parents

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
you never know what will go wrong

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
it sounds like the guys just chill

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
but it was like same relationship

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
with anybody's mom

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
yeah mom and made up a lie

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
and then his mom was at the DMV going

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
you know my son's a gold medalist and

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
he didn't want to say

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
he was out cheating on his girlfriend

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
and he was out banging chicks in Brazil

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
and got super drunk and he should have caught the flight

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
and he peed on a thing and act like an asshole

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
which I'm sure he's done many many times

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
so have I

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
never told my mom

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
always told her I was at Rocky Horror Picture Show

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
and then I came home

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
he told his mom

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
to sound like the outlawed Josie Wales

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
my son's the outlawed Josie Wales

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
he's a hero

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
he was just a drunk tish bag

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
it's fucking hilarious

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
these are kids though right when we think of the

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I guess I tried to kid by our new definition

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
but the Duffer Brothers are kids

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
the swimmers he left behind

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
were kids

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
he was the old guy

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
and then he was like well I got a plan to catch

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
see you dudes later you're going to get in trouble

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
with everybody in South America

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
no details okay

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
so fun though

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I didn't watch a lick of the Olympics

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I feel fine

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
I miss them though

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I love the Olympics

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I didn't think these Olympics would happen

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I don't know why I didn't think they would happen

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I was really excited about all the terrible stories

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
that were going to come out and there was only like five of them

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
it was just like the water turned green

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
also did you guys hear that Ryan Lochte almost got murdered

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
what

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
she was crazy down there

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
you want to rally around a villain

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
that I'm pretty sure is safe to

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
none of us will go to hell for

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
verbally lynching

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
what was the fucking thing

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I read one article about it

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
the dude who did a

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
grinder sting

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
and he was outing people from different

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
countries

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
because he couldn't get into the

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
inner sanctum and do his

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
expose and how they all fucking party and stuff

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
and so he from outside the

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
walls of that inner sanctum

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
was like well what can I do

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
and like I mean this is what I'm hearing but

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
he made a fake grinder account

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
and was like

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
an article

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
that was like about

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
all the dudes that

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
answered his grinder call

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
and countries where like being out is not

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
okay

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
including America if you choose not to be out

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
just to interject that

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
that's what journalism is

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
that's what it's called now so when we're

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
like fucking Nancy Grace can suck it

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
that's what it is they're ruining it

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
for fucking everyone else

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I like the Olympics because if the US

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
women were their own country they would

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
have come in second for gold medals

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
that's how many fucking gold medals the US

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
women did

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I love it

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I cry every goddamn time

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
also there was a fucking

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
me and my girlfriend were watching

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
men's synchronized diving

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
like runway model

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
and one guy's name was Steele Johnson

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
which is fucking

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Steele Johnson

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
there was a woman named Misty Hyman

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
there was

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
there were two guys in the German team named

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Butch and Fuchs and they were standing next to each other all the time

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
it looked like buttfucks it was fucking great

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
if that doesn't make you want to

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
watch the Olympics then maybe

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
you and I aren't friends

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
you worked for Ellen for a long time right

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
first five years

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I'm assuming it was an honorable discharge

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
and you have good things to say about it

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I don't know if we'll go into that on this episode

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
but uh

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
regardless I thought it was

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
did you see the thing where she posted the

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
or whatever her camp posted the photo shop thing

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
of her riding the same bolt

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
the same bolt and it was like

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
am I crazy or was that like

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
she's like this is how I go grocery shopping from now on

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
and people are like you're racist like he's not your mule

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
he's not your donkey

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
no the joke is

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
he's fast yeah the joke is he's fast

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
and I'm lazy this phenomenon

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
of like I mean I guess it's always been around

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
but now you can really look at it and point at it

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
it's like the uh those

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
persons so woke that

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
they can perceive racism

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
all kinds of places

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
how with an uncanny ability

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
to project it

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
and the proof is that you're arguing it

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
that's it

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
proof is that you're fighting back

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
saying no I'm not

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
yeah you're looking at a picture

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
and going like oh I get it

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
you're saying he's a pack animal

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
I just think that's amazing

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I thought it was like

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
I'm gonna now solve racism

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
somewhere else other than myself

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
if Donald Trump photoshopped himself

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
on top of you same bolt then that would cause

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
for alarm but I think

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Ellen's safe

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
she's making a joke

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
I won't answer for her

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
is it true that you gave her a misty hymen?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
yikes

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
boo

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
so

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
knowing that we're

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
definitely not into victim blaming

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
is there a

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
here's a section called victim blaming

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
is there a list

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
of things

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
that you guys

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
are putting together

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
when I watch

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
forensic files I'm like

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
like Jeff and I always say

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
okay so if you're gonna get away with murder

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
have a boat and some

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
yeah

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
do you guys have a list?

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
we don't always say that though

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
we said it once and that was between us

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
don't have a boat and fire a boat

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
I don't even think it counts anymore

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
because there's cameras on the boats now

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
but

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
is there a list of things that you guys have started to acquire

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
kind of like don'ts

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
for people that would like to stay

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
not murder victims?

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
well fucking hitchhiking

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
I mean everyone knows it but you would not believe

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
what went on in the 70s

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
boys and girls were getting murdered

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
there were three freeway

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
killers in Los Angeles

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
between 1970 and 1980

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
three different serial killers killing hitchhikers

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
on the freeway down here

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
so when hitchhiking was popular

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
and all of the

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
hitchhiking can kill you urban legends were happening

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
that wasn't just

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
society coming down on something that

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
threatened the automotive industry

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
no

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
that wasn't a scam of any kind

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
and they weren't urban legends

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
it was a dangerous thing to be doing for everybody

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
and also

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
another kind of victim

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
area that nobody talks about

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
was gay men

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
two of the freeway killers

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
were specifically killing

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
picking up and killing gay men

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
and there was one

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I think a reporter that was in Orange County

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
that found a file

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
that said like the freeway

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
fag killer or something

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
and that's how he put it together

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
that this one person was responsible for killing

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
here and it was the same person responsible

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
for killing in Orange County

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
like nobody gave a shit

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
it's just another one of those things of victims that don't matter

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
well it's like calling it when you're like

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
this guy is killing prostitutes

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
instead of saying this guy is killing women

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
which is like what's really happening

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
people just immediately don't give a shit

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
why are they fucking using it

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
that's the ultimate she asked for it

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
don't be gay

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
yes

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
if you're gay be careful

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
be more careful

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
the main pockets

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
of serial killers is like

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
washington states

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
oh pacific northwest

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I was just up there

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
and they have these little

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
roadside

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
that's where all the serial killers come from

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
they're all born

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
they either do all their killing there or they're all

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
born yeah exactly

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
and they all move along or go somewhere else and do it

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
but there's these little coffee

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
shop places where one girl works there

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
and she's like it's a bikini coffee place

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
or lingerie coffee place

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
and it's in the middle of the countryside

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
and everyone that pulls up

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
is dudes in trucks with guns on the racks

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
and stuff like that

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
you live in the capital of serial killers

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
and you're letting women just work alone

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
in the middle of...

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
well just if those women had guns too

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
it'd all work out

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
let the good girls and bikinis have guns

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
when are we gonna test this theory

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I hope they do

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
until everybody has a gun

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
and we see if all the killing starts

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000
so we all got guns up here are you guys ready?

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I just don't think it's just so fucking

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
it pisses me off and it's so unfair

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
and it will never change it like I can't go for a fucking

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
walk at night without

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
because I weigh and I'm smaller than

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
a fucking dude who just feels like

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
was raised badly and hit his head as a kid

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
and he wants to fucking work

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
you know what's crazy about that is that I have to imagine

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
that probably because you maybe have a fist full

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
of keys in your pocket or something

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
but I have to imagine

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
that if you and I got into a fight

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
I don't even know

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
that's a thing

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
that's double the crime

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
let's find out

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
ladies and gentlemen

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
in this corner

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
say it's an extra crime that it's like

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
the idea that if you're window shopping for a victim

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
it's kind of outrageous

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
me that I'm not an option

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
because I'm a six foot nerd

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
like I'm such an easy kill

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
like and I

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I want to have that

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Dan I would totally kill you

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
and then

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
happy birthday

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
I don't like having my underdog status taken away

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
from me

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
the thing is

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
that's how Gamergate started

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
that was my reenactment

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
that was my masterpiece theater

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
I was already a nerd

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
they're on here

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
they're playing video games

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
no matter how low status or small

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
or whatever you think you are as a guy

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
you've never had to worry about being an elevator

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
you've never had to worry about walking through a parking structure

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
I mean like in certain neighborhoods

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I might get jumped here

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
but I'm not going to get sexually assaulted

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
well now let's add deeper

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
and sadder

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
and add black woman

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
if you're a black woman

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
and you guys mentioned it

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
if you're a

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
niche like you're into murder

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
you know about what's his name

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Sleepyhead

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
that little bear

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
from the motel

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
that's how I take things back

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I try to give him cute names

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
sleepy pants

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
he thought he was a badass

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
but

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I call him pajama man

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
and he's like

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
we know about that

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
I watched that documentary

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
and it was like it's fucking profound

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
and it's profound in a sad way

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
like if you watch an informed documentary about drug policy

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
or something like that

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
if you're in the market for white guilt

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I mean your shopping cart is full already

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
but

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
if you want to really

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
like fill that

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
fucker up

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
because it's just every frame of it from beginning to end

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
is just shining a flashlight

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
on a spot that has no flashlight

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
no camera

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
trained on it nothing

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
do you want to be the most prolific

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
most successful serial killer in the world

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
just live in this neighborhood

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
and kill this demographic

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
it's called living in a

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
high risk

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
you're a high risk demographic

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
so that's why when you kill prostitutes

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
and drug dealers and drug addicts

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
it's their sex worker

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
it's because

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
quote and this is why they don't really

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
worry about it is you're a high risk victim

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
and so

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
somehow it's your fault

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I think we're all watching the night of

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
is there a last episode tonight?

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Don't say anything!

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
I'm so scared

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
John Chaturro has a little monologue in there

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
when he's talking to his little protege

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
and he mentions

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
it culminates in urban women

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
urban women

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
they're like a lotus leaf

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
they're

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
why would that be?

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I'm assuming that that is somehow based in

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
some kind of reality

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
why would you want black women on your jury

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
if they are the most at risk

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
if they are the most

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
is there a horrible

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
is there anything

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
behind that Wheel of Fortune

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
letter?

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
because he was saying you do want black women on your jury?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
that's what the thesis

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
of his monologue was

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
and he didn't really

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
I don't know if that was based on anything

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
I'm scared to incriminate myself

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I don't know

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I guess

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
maybe if I was going to

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
speculate and get a

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
podcast suicide

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
I guess I would be trying to get into

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
the area of

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
is there a victim signal

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
sent through media

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
it's like you deserve it

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
and is that so fucking

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
would that be actually so effective

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
that it would carry over into your outside watching television

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
life and into everything that you do

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
can you really just

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
but I think that it goes

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
to the individual because there's so many

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
even in that grim sleeper documentary

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
that fucking woman Pam

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
he drove around with was such a badass

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
she was

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
she had lived life, she knew that whole neighborhood

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
she knew the guy, I think she had been his victim

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
it was

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
an amazing example of

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I think that the storyline

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
might be victim but I don't think

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
the reality for the average

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
woman is victim and I think that's kind of the

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
I think that's the thing that's bubbling up in all of this

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
is like now that everybody

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
has more of a voice on the internet

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
and people get to kind of say their shit, yes there's fighting

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
yes there's Gamergate, yes people

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
there are people who want to hate

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
other, they want to other people

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
so that they can get away from themselves

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
but ultimately what's coming up

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
out of all of this is strength

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
and a voice and people that are watching

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
other people speak for themselves

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
and then maybe they didn't have a strong mother

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
or a strong father

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
maybe they didn't have any good example

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
but they're watching people online going yeah that's how I feel

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
yeah that's fuck this shit

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
like I don't have to do what I was maybe

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
you had a mother who raised you to be like

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
you be polite no matter what

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
you still are an individual that can make that decision for yourself

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
well I mean

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
yeah we get it

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
that's really it at the end of the day

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
and it's like and so

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
there can be evolution I think

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
because of the way

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
kind of

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
the internet is and just kind of the way

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
people are connected these days

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
you have neuroplasticity my therapist says

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
I can be a douchebag at 27 when I'm talking to you

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
and like I can

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
slowly like force myself

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
to

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
think differently it's actually possible

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
giraffes can't do it, they can't do it

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
but I mean that's the thing is

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
you can see course correction

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
online and people are slowly

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I think slowly learning

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
that you can fuck up badly

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
and still go sorry I was wrong

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
you can oftentimes people do it

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
because they write a think piece or they do whatever

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
but it's like going it's like that

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Lindy West story where the guy was harassing her

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
to the point where he was emailing her

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
asking her what he if he

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
if she thought her dead father was

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
ashamed of her or some really intense

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
really personal trolling

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
she called him on the phone and said

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
hey I found out it's you

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
why did you do this and he had this whole

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
thing of like I'm so sorry

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
and like it's that thing of like internet trolls

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
that's just as real as the internet

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
and the moment and the time that's taking place

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
there's a real human being on the other side of that

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
there's real human beings on the other side

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
of all of these things and I think

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
people are slowly starting to learn that

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
and at first it takes the form

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
of something that feels

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
dehumanizing to the wrong people at the wrong time

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
I think one of the big ironies is

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
you have the Spock demographic

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
let's I'll claim

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
ambassadorship ambassador

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I'll just go ahead and say white privileged

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
spectromy

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
so I can like

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
always felt like an underdog always very

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
prideful about the fact that he always

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
knew how the systems worked and why they were

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
unfair and all these things suddenly being

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
told oh you don't know nothing

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
it's hard being this it's hard being that

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
you have this weird impulse where you're like

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
oh wait a minute logic should rule the day

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
it always has for me in spite of getting beat up

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
in gym class logic always prevails

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
so why are you being so illogical about this

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
and then you're hearing somebody go like

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
that's what the fucking person just said to me

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
that is oppressing me you fucking

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
pig you've asked all you fuckface

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
and you're like well that's not very logical meet meet meet

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
and that's what's happening right now

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
is these like as this water table rises

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
but I do I

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I think I'm hearing an optimistic

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
message here and I share it like I

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
feel I go through these funks where I'm

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
like we're just fucked we're so fucked we're

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
such toxic pigs

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
but I then we're not I mean

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
partly it's like listening to you talk about

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
murders as my girlfriend and I go off to sleep

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
and it's like you know if murder

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
if murder itself which should just

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
be this horrible thing where road flares

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
are set up and traffic is stopped and

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
people are yelling things out about OJ

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
and gloves not fitting throwing Barbie dolls with

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
duct tape on them onto the JonBenét Ramsey's

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
lawn and everything gets gross around

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
at the scene of a death everything gets toxic

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
everything get the it's

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
the actual putrification of the

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
corpse is reflected by a societal

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
rot that was are we all

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
stink with the closer we get to death

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
when we were talking about it but it's

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
it's undone by a podcast

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
where you're hanging out

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
and there's a little bit of coffee and a

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
little bit of shit and you guys are friendly

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
and chatting and you're going like there's

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
a little bit of don't go in that house girl

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
and there's a there and there and then

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
a lot of like depth of like what would

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
it feel like to be in that moment and all

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
this stuff if the

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
listening to stuff like that reminds me that

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
like that's not possible if not for this whole

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
flood like this unfortunate

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
metaphor right now for our friends in the

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
South sorry the the

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
because that's all fear it's all

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
fear it's the fear

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
everything we talk about is

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
managing fear it's dealing with

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
fear with you are dealing with a person

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
online that you fucking hate

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
and you want to tell them how much you hate them

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
that's all well and good and you can

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
do it and you can type it in and it's there

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
forever but at the end of the

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
day it's in you it's your

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
thing and slowly but surely

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
you know it was like we were all in grammar

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
school when the internet started and we're like

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
oh my god they talk bad about me on a

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
fucking you know a page I'm dead

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
forever whatever and then you slowly go oh that was

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
probably a 13 year old in a basement

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
somewhere it's you know what I mean and we're

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
all developing and growing as these

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
conversations are happening

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
at lightning fucking speed

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
and as we do and develop and grow

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
that we're

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
learning to manage ultimately

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
our fear of death and

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
and ultimately it's human connection

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
that makes us happy

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
our fear of each other and our fear of ourselves

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
yeah like what's your worst nightmare in a conversation

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
the part of the irony is

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
tying it to that fear of woman walking alone at

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
night and you are bound in by all these

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
rules that you didn't even know you had until

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
it's too late when it's like somebody is creeping

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
you out it's like you have these instincts

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
kicking in about oh well I don't want to be

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
a bitch if I survive this

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
the this

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
there's a similar thing playing out for everybody

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
online because they're all anonymous

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
there's like some of that stuff is getting there's

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
an uplifting like cowardice being revealed

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
because it's like oh you started

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
an account that is exclusively for trolling

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
but when when then

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
fists still start flying and that person

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
will still express some kind of weird

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
defense of some position

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
no matter how much they think they're like

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
just vandalizing like like some kind

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
of group think they're there they get

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
freaked out when you like come at them

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
and so we all get

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
freaked out when we feel unsafe and

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
so it's like

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
okay if the internet is a cesspool of a

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
bunch of cowardice and toxicity

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
could that give way to a Venice

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
that you go okay so let's put some

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
sticks on top of that and

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
and a gift shop over here and make some

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
good fucking art

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
up above the water that's the whole idea

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
it's just like instead of

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
like yes that's a reality just like

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
fucking Donald Trump's tweets every single

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
day are a reality

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
but that does I have friends who are in full

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
fucking panic about Donald Trump because

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
that's all they see it's all they hear

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
it's all those news networks talk about

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
good right it's like it's called a vaccine

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
it's exposing your system to things that

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
and to go that's not okay with me

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
the idea that this man thinks that he's

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
going to build a wall is not okay with me

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
it's not okay with me that he says all Mexicans

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
are rapists none of this shit's okay

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
and you can't tweet every day as a politician

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
and have that be the reason why you

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
win an election like you can't

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
quite the opposite I would say

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
it's not just like it's not

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
like starting a mattress store and going on TV

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
and going like my prices are crazy

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
like Duncan Trestle's theory

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
on what Trump is doing

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
which scared the shit out of me

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
and also part of the reason why

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
I'm talking about murder makes me feel better

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
even though I have these like fucking crazy issues

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
about being scared of being killed

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
is that when I like when you acknowledge

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
these people that this has happened to

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
and they're still humans

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
and you can still fucking relive their experience

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
and it makes you happy for your life a little bit

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
more I feel like it makes me value

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
life and value the fucking experiences I get

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
and that I haven't been murdered yet

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
and how lucky I am and like acknowledging

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
that this happens all the time

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
and it could go like this or you could live

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
with my grandma and like you just don't have

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
any fucking clue what your experience is or control

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I think your grandma's gonna be murdered any day now

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
how dare you

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
oh shit

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
well let's look into that

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
has that been investigated

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
are you saying you did it

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I'm just saying I suspect foul play

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
are you guys shifting your focus

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
you said you found out

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
oh this demographic and the

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
if you're not the grim sleeper but you're still like

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
are you

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
putting pressure on yourselves

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
to like are you shifting your

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
are you gonna do more episodes

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
about

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
about the less than

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
famous like serial killers

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
and victims and George has always done those

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
ones she likes to do like a deep

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
dive and find those

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
those kind of rare ones that people may have

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
never heard of I imagine the fact that they're rare

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
means that there's less

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
software to run

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
on that platform it's like there's

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
the point is the system is looking

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
at it as a bunch of garbage

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
so it's not every fucking article

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
takes a paragraph from another

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
article and rewrites it

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
so you have to read like 18 of them before

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
you can really pick out the

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
stuff that wasn't

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
rewritten in every other article I hate research

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
so much

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Georgia what do you gravitate towards

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
are you trying to find the off the beaten track ones

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I love unsolved

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
murders I love

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
there aren't big media sensation ones

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
like family murders that are just like

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
they happen in the in

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
67 and they have a clear fucking

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
like a clear motive and a clear suspect

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
and that suspect is still alive

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
and yet it just hasn't found either the right

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
web slews or the right fucking detective

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
to open it back up and it's it's

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
shitty like prosecutor in the first place

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
yeah and then I talk about and then I say

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
the name of the person who's a suspect

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
and then Karen has to say

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
so everyone knows we're not like you have to

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
like have a disclaimer on there because I'm just blaming

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
this person who's like a fucking one

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
off still alive

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
we shouldn't talk about it

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
I do it again

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I've been asked by our producers is this a terrible

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
time to do a me undies ad

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
no it's not

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I mean I think

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
that in this age of murder

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
and

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
I mean

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
whether or not you want to it makes you want to live

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
more or prepare for death

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
as your mother always told you

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
underwear is important

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
I don't know if that's

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
do you have evidence

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
I would go dry on this one musically

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
you want to do it dry?

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
do it dry

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
did you girls know that

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
there is

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
there is a material

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
twice as soft as cotton

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
why no Dan

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
I was

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
I was about to do some dumb metaphor

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
about victims' throats or something

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
it was going to undo

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
and then I shared my work and you guys

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
punished me for it

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
so who's the villain

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
just like the internet

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
yeah I was honest

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
and I censored myself now I'm going to do

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
a mass shooting

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
after a quick manifesto

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
about my underwear

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
by the time you see this

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
I will have murdered a million people

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I love my undies

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
I love

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
me undies

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
now me undies are soft

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
yeah

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
they're made of a space age fabric

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
go back to the part about people's throats

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
people's throats will go

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
oh when they see your underwear

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
if you replace

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
cotton

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
which has a horrible legacy

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
of actual murder

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
with a new synthetic fabric

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
probably the only bad thing

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
that modal ever did

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
was kill you with comfort

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
yeah

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
we probably

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
put lots of people out of a job

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
if it's able to be made by robots

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
but who were those people

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
what's that

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
you know

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Dan

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
if you go to meundies.com

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
you get 20% off your first order

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
and if you don't like them you get to keep them anyway

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I know that's the crazy thing

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
I know it's weird

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
it gives you underwear it doesn't want them back

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
but

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
you can just keep them

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
you can just exploit the system

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
I truly do think

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
this is a golden age of podcasting

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
we're in a sweet spot now

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
I may have to be more shameful in my advertising

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
because I won't be able to say

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I'll be like you know what

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
it's great as General Electric's new cluster drone

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
takes care of those unwannable

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
third world dictators

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
from a distance your family can appreciate

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
it passes the savings on to AT&T

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
but right now it's meundies

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
all they do is cradle

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
your balls, labia

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
and or combination of both

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
fucking American and entitled to have

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
that's right

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
and it's your fucking business too

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
it's called privacy it's different from honesty

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
this is a company that will swath

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
your nethers in fucking like

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
they're soft on your nethers

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
they're also soft on murder which I think

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
that's a problem

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
well the only reason

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
I want to clarify their position about that

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
they were

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
asked do you like murderers

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
and all they said was

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
we believe they are as entitled to comfortable

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
underwear as anyone else

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
in my opinion that is their corporate

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
position I value that

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
I don't want to wear underwear

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
made by a corporation

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
that is dipping their toe in politics

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
I want them

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
I know they wouldn't win a popularity contest

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
saying it but the truth is

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
my favorite underwear company would be the one that said

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
you know maybe if Hitler

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
had had better underwear

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
some lives could have been saved

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
he would have only killed 3 million Jews

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I want my underwear company

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
looking at everything through the lens

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
of underwear

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I want them to put genocide

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
and crime and morals

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
on the hamper

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
as they say

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
on the back burner

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
do they say that?

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
and another company

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
new hamper back burners

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
when you

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
don't want to cook something

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
in the immediate sense and you want it to slowly simmer

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
why not put it on a bag of dirty clothes

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
new hamper back burners

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000

look at our first meundies

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
my audience

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
tell them to fucking show us

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
where the rubber meets the road

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
God

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
I would just like to say

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
as a feral audio podcast

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
I'm never taking another note

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
about the way we read and add again

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
we put a lot of thought into this Karen

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
this is a special bonus for you guys

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
we invited you to the scene

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
of the murder of monetization

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
wait wait

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
there's a chalk outline of all of our income

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
do you two also do meundies ads?

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
we're going to

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
we're going to steal this one

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
we're just going to take it and plug it in

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
something about the holocaust

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Dan Armand's meundie I want a Cleo

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
his meundies ad

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
it hit every base you want to hit

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
with advertising

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
serial killing

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
serial killing

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
shitting in your pants

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
corporation

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
corporation yes

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
but I do want to say

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
but they're so comfortable

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I do want to say

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
this is the thing that crosses the lines between

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
I know we've been indoctrinated in our society

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
when we look at people

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
in pictures who care about their underwear

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
or companies that are selling their underwear

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
it's like a lot of people in my audience

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
who are

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
a larger demographic than

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
people would like to believe

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
I'm talking to you

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Senator Ben

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
I don't know what I'm talking about

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Senator Ben Carson

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
oh shit you're a senator now

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
I'm talking about people who are like

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I don't care about underwear exactly

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
you know why you don't because they don't matter

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
which is why

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
they should be comfortable

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
and you don't have to be like

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
for instance just a couple of bullet points

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
let's say for instance

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
maybe you don't love the way you look

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
in your underwear maybe it's not something you look for

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
this isn't that kind of these are comfortable

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
I'm saying like and also

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
I just want to throw this out and I swear

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
I know this is something that I tell them

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
I tell you people in spite of

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
my sponsors wishes

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I'm sure

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
these things are good for wearing

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
more than once

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
they're better than cotton

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
for fucking being a slob

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I wear my Mia I get

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
way more with

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
wearing me and these longer

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
I got to say as someone who I get so

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
angry at commercials that I yell at them

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
ask my husband I just like can't

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
even fucking deal with this is beautiful

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
and I love this so much

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
and if you go what is it

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
miandistatcom.com

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
is it like a 20% discount something like that

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
you get 20% off in your first pair

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
I think let me double check that

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
20 I think 20 is 20

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
that's fucking crazy

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I say 100% off

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
whoa whoa

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
if you come to my house all underwear

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
100% off

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
but that ties in

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
everything must go

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
that ties into the mattress ad from last week

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
so are women safer now

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
I was just gonna say

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
then they were

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
how much do you pay for a half hour

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
ad on

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I don't want to know because I don't want to feel guilty

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
like if it's $8 I'm gonna be like

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I'm gonna get heartburn tonight

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
I'm pretty sure we only sold two pairs of underwear

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
but they're $400 each

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
yeah but you get to wear

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
you say yeah

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
20% off they're free if you

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
or a dick and pretend you don't like them

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
they're free

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
yes if you go there and go

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
to the hashtag or the slash

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
downtown just buy a bunch of free underwear

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
and then say I'm just satisfied

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
with my underwear

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
that's the new shoplifting

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
I don't want you to do it like remember adobe

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
in the early aughts it was like

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
they knew I was stealing all their software

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
because they knew I'd turn 40 and be unable to

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
steal it anymore and have to buy it

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
but I would have learned all the adobe software

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
what else am I gonna use

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
to photoshop my stuff

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
moto mop

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
no

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
I'm gonna use the thing I learned by stealing

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
when I was 25

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
is the

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
meondies ad still happening right now?

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
meondies

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
we normally end it with a jingle

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
don't we? yes

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
it's a controversial jingle but here it is

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
meondies

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
if you wear them

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
you won't get killed

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I don't know if they make themselves legally

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
kind of a big claim

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
accountable I don't know if that's

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
it's a sign but

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
if you or someone you know does get killed

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
in those undies

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
next pair is free

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
that's actually the part I don't know

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
it's a good deal

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
I'm just spitballing over here

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Spencer what are your thoughts about murder?

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
I'm for it

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
most the time

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
during these two hours

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
during these two hours

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
certainly

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
no it's bad

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
murder is bad you guys

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
and I'm glad that you asked me

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
that question so I could finally

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
tell the audience

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
that I feel that murder is bad

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
no the only thing

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
I could think of during this whole two hours

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
is the fact that

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
women feeling safe is bad

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
for me

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
women not feeling safe

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
oh no

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
whoops

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
is that a Freudian slip

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
whoops

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
go to meondies.com

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
enter the code

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
whoops

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
I could see it either way

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
I wasn't sure if it was a Freudian supernat

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.000
because I was like I could make either argument

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
is this something to think about I thought

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I figured I should bring it up too early

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
that's how we could help women

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
we could do some PSAs where we go

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
you know what I think is hot

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
a safe woman

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
but then we say we don't care

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
she emanates a certain je ne sais quoi

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
that gets this fella

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
ready to propose

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
pepper spray

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
you do the pepper spray Adam

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
I'm doing

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
oh man you could do pepper spray ads

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
oh my god

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
it would be a great tie-in

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
that's sarcasm

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
no in a general sense

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
we talked about

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I think we created

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
an uplifting sunrise that we're looking forward to

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
on the internet

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
in real life

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
8 billion people

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
now it's 9 billion what is it

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
we're just choking the planet

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
you guys are in this crevice

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
where you're breathing

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
oxygen into a pocket

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
that was carbon dioxide

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
you're in the darkness

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
but in general

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
should we just go to the moon

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
and colonize with a couple hundred people

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
that was the premise of this podcast

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
I think it's so fun that we get to watch

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
the downfall

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
it's so exciting

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
it makes me super fucking gets bummed

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
this is so cool we get to watch how

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
something fucking crumbled

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
and laugh at it

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
before it gets really awful in like 2040

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
I feel like I'm older than you are

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
but I feel like I timed this just right

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
totally

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
I'm gonna watch the shit hit the fan

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
and I'll be like 70 fuck it

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
is it possible we're all paying the price

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
for baby boomers feeling that way

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
that they're kind of like oh man

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
we did the Beatles we hit a golf ball in the moon

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
let's fuck up

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
and then we were like but what about

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Cobain and they're like fuck you

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
fuck him and we're like fine

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
I'm gonna not wash my hair and they're like good

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
saves the planet

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
I feel like the baby boomers never had the comfort

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
of modal underwear

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
could make all the difference

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
I mean what do we

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
what do we foresee

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
you're intelligent people like you've studied

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
murder in a consumer way

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
off of Wikipedia

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
community college dropout

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
as our species

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
I think a lot of us even the optimists

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
among us walk around with the

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
idea are the optimistic

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
idea that well

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
we're headed for a gigantic cataclysmic

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
shift that is going to see a lot of

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
I know but you know what

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Dan I think people

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
have always thought that they always think

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
that great it's it happens

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
all the time I think if you're plugged

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
into certain messaging

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
that's the message that you'll get

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
but I just here's the thing

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
maybe it's because I have epilepsy

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I don't have time for all that shit

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
I really don't I'm stoked

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
not to get too dark

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
or whatever but like my mom had

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Alzheimer's for 12 years she died in January

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
it fucking sucked

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
for 12 years straight in my

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
family it blew don't worry about it

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
it blew

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
unbelievably badly it was terrible

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
and it's not terrible anymore

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
and so I don't give one single

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
fuck if they every day report

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
that there's an asteroid coming

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
or this or that because I'm like

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
oh my god we're okay again

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
and things are getting things are only

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
getting better and that's maybe my

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
ridiculous opinion but I'm

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
literally fighting every day to have that opinion

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
because it's one or you

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
choose it's one or the other

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
well I'd rather die feeling that way with you

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
right well

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
I'll take a special bulletproof bomb shelter

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
where we can feel that way because that's it's like if the

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
asteroid whatever the asteroid is

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Donald Trump but the asteroid is fucking

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
the Zika virus

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
whatever this the thing is they wanna

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:54.000
keep

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
their vadert

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
their Jupacabra

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
jupacabra

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
they don't talk about the jupacabra anymore

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
poly chart that's how

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:10.000
jama man

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
but I mean it's always a thing

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
that's just over the

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
mountain that you should be locked down

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.640
tested, we passed, the power went out in New York,

01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:20.980
and it was just like, the ice cream melted,

01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:21.960
and we ate the ice cream.

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:22.800
People are good.

01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:24.920
You look at the micro shit, and you're like,

01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:27.120
if I stop looking at the fucking internet,

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.000
and I'm like, I live in this cute little apartment,

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.600
I have this fucking nice dude that I met,

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:33.560
I have these great cats, everything is actually fine,

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:35.640
and then you look at, you take two steps out,

01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:36.960
and look at fucking Trump and shit,

01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:38.920
and life is ruined.

01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:41.000
It's like newsworthy, it's like,

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:45.440
oh man, newlywed couple plays video game

01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.400
about raising a baby, well they're a real baby,

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:49.240
rats in a crib, eaten by a cat,

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:52.800
there is no way to have a headline,

01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:54.000
and no one would click on it,

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.080
but from a general perspective,

01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:59.920
truly the objective empirical scientific headline

01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:03.520
should be, every day, eight billion people

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:05.440
get through another day,

01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:09.320
having taken back the earth from a merciless god

01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:11.080
that has had them in the crosshairs

01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:13.680
since they learned to stop being monkeys.

01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:15.800
Yeah, that's right.

01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:18.720
And when those eight million people,

01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:21.040
when it comes down to it, yes there's group think,

01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:24.600
and yes there's like, when people do weird shit en masse,

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:26.040
but at the end of the day,

01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:27.320
when you're standing on the street,

01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:28.800
and somebody gets hit by a car,

01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:31.560
everybody runs fucking toward the person that's down.

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:33.200
That it's just human, that's human.

01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:34.800
Cameras out and ready to roll.

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:36.480
Taking it all down, but I mean.

01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:38.320
It's called the nightcrawler spirit.

01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:42.000
We're all gonna make $500.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.760
But I truly believe that I think that

01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:45.520
that's the true instinct of people.

01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:48.400
If you've gone to a certain direction

01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:50.520
to shut that down, that's your choice,

01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:51.880
but that is not common.

01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:54.760
That is not, I don't think that's the common human thing.

01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:56.640
Plaintlets rush toward an open climate.

01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:57.960
That's what's great about it.

01:51:57.960 --> 01:51:59.920
It's healing, we wanna heal.

01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:02.320
We're lucky to be, like all of us here,

01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:05.320
like we are doing a stupid podcast

01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:06.880
and do comedy with microphones up here,

01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:08.760
but the fact that a group of people all come here

01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:11.600
just to sit around in a group of strangers and laugh,

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:13.000
that's really magnificent.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:13.840
It's amazing.

01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:14.680
It really is crazy.

01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:15.880
It says a lot about underwear.

01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:19.440
And the state of it, like these people

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:21.040
had to hang out for two hours

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:23.800
in whatever they left the house in.

01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:27.480
Some of them probably chose cotton from a hains or play text.

01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:29.840
But they didn't know, they didn't know, they couldn't know.

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:31.920
No, they couldn't have known until they came here tonight.

01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:33.120
There's a new thing.

01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:35.080
Cotton is dumb.

01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:36.880
Cotton's dead, Cotton's dead.

01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:39.240
Cotton is the murder victim of fabrics.

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:42.160
You should dismiss it.

01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:42.920
What, did I not get it?

01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:43.680
No, no, yeah, yeah.

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:44.160
Did I?

01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:46.200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Cotton's dead.

01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:47.360
No, I think you get it.

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:51.240
Cotton murders, Cotton murders your comfort.

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:52.080
Cotton's the bad guy.

01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:53.640
It deserves it, and it deserves it.

01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:54.120
Yeah.

01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:55.480
Do you guys remember, we've talked, I think,

01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:56.520
remember the Noid?

01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:58.600
Have you got, remember the Noid thing?

01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:00.280
Oh yeah, from Domino's?

01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:02.760
Domino's Pizza had a Noid, a Noid, and he was like,

01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:05.280
oh, careful of the Noid wants your pizza to be cold.

01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:09.480
There was a guy that worked for, his name was Noid,

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:11.240
and the reason they dropped that ad campaign

01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:15.000
is because that guy thought they were talking about him.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.720
And he went and killed people.

01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:18.040
I don't think that worked.

01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:19.640
Ooh, I'm doing that one.

01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:20.400
So look it up.

01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:23.040
I apologize in advance if he snopes it.

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:26.120
Held up at Domino's and no one died, but uh.

01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:26.920
Wait, sorry, OK.

01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:28.280
He held up at Domino's?

01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:29.440
Was it Domino's, right?

01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:30.840
What are you telling?

01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:31.920
What?

01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:33.760
Was he a Domino's employee?

01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:34.600
No.

01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:36.400
He was a dude whose name was Noid, right?

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:39.520
Yeah, he was like, you guys can't keep telling people

01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:40.360
to avoid me.

01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:41.520
This has gone far enough.

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:42.720
It's that thing of like.

01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:45.440
I'm going to send a message.

01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:47.040
Yeah, you should come toward me.

01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:49.280
That thing of when you're like, the FBI are following me,

01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:51.000
and you're like, make sure the FBI aren't following

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.800
that guy before you tell him that he's crazy.

01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:55.160
And then it's like Noid was like, the fucking TV's talking

01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:56.640
to me, and it's like, no, they're actually talking.

01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:58.080
They're telling people to avoid you.

01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:00.560
Like, legit, and they went crazy.

01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:01.560
Yeah.

01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:02.920
You can't avoid the Noid.

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:05.400
They're talking.

01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:06.960
It's true.

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:09.760
He killed himself.

01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:12.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Well, it's not.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.680
What did we learn tonight that we should face that shit?

01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:19.920
That we should have never gone over to that side of the room.

01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:24.760
Well, I hope you guys come back and just be friends with us,

01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:27.680
because I want to binge listen to every episode of your show,

01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:29.240
because I'm hooked on this shit.

01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:29.720
It's great.

01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:30.240
It's great.

01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:31.160
It's a lot of bullshit.

01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:33.160
Podcasting.

01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:34.160
Thank you.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.080
Is there any while we have you here?

01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:41.960
I mean, because you did us a favor by appearing,

01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:46.760
do you have any other side things you want to pluggy-wug?

01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:48.320
You're appearing at Mr. Chuckles.

01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:49.160
Oh, yes, yes.

01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:51.480
My big gig.

01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:53.480
We're going to be on the podcast festival.

01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:54.480
Oh, yeah.

01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:58.000
LA Podcast Fest, the end of September.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.680
I think that's our next big.

01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:01.560
This was actually our plug for a long time.

01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:03.000
So now we don't have to.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.360
Especially, you've got a plug, Spencer.

01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:05.240
Are you plugging anything?

01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:05.720
Oh, yeah.

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:08.800
I'm going to be at LA Podcast Festival,

01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:11.920
just in the audience.

01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:14.680
You can see a live stream of his night vision photography.

01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:20.840
Thank you so much, everybody.

01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:22.840
That's been Harmon 10.

01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:28.200
Georgia Hardstark, Karen Kilgariff, and Spencer Crittenden.

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:31.200
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:34.040
You may have first, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:36.040
Don't kill anybody.

01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:38.040
Please don't kill anybody.

01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:40.040
This is going to be fun.

01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:58.040
Did you get any of that?

01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:00.040
It's a good show.
