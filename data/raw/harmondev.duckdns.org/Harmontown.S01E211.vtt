When she...\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:31.000\nI was just listening to an audio yesterday in my car.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:33.000\nWhen she sat back down, did she start crying?\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:36.000\nOh, yeah. Well, she started crying before she sat back down.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:40.000\nWe hooked her on that fucking Hollywood stage magic, man.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:42.000\nShe got a taste of it.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:44.000\nShe's got nothing to compare it to.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:47.000\nWe created a child star.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:49.000\nBut when you gave her a chance...\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:51.000\nWhen you gave her a chance...\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:53.000\nWhen she had a chance to speak, she was like,\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:57.000\nLook, man. She was being a refused Nick.\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:59.000\nAnd then she got back in her seat and she cried.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:02.000\nShe was like, I fucking blew my chance.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:04.000\nBut honestly, she was...\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:06.000\nShe just cried because she was sitting up on stage\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:07.000\nand she liked it.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:09.000\nI know exactly how that feels.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:11.000\nI would love to not...\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.000\nI was the little kid in those pajamas\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:15.000\nthat would come out in the living room.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:17.000\nI'm sure it's Los Angeles.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nProbably half of the audience or more.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.000\nIt was the kid in the family\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:23.000\nthat was like, look at me, look at me.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nAnd it feels good when strangers pay attention to you\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.000\nbecause you know that while they're doing it,\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:30.000\nyour parents can't hit you.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:32.000\nIt's safe.\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:34.000\nIt's like that moment in Texas Chainsaw Massacre\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:36.000\nwhen you're flagging down the cop car.\n\n02:36.000 --> 02:38.000\nIt's like, nothing bad can happen now.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:40.000\nOh, it's the cop that makes chili out of people.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:42.000\nAlso, second question.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:44.000\nHow old is Timur?\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:46.000\nTimur is 16.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:48.000\nI was trying to visualize him\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:51.000\nbecause I can't afford the subscription to our show.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.000\nYeah, I love my neighbors.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:55.000\nThe Bootsons, of course, they humanize me.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:58.000\nOf course, I'm all caught up in the Hollywood lifestyle.\n\n02:58.000 --> 02:59.000\nI'm a cynical person.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:00.000\nI'm a Capricorn.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:01.000\nI'm hierarchical.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:02.000\nI'm patriarchal.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nI'm self-loathing.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nI don't smell the roses.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:09.000\nI don't notice avocado trees or eucalyptus.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.000\nYou know, she makes me muffins.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:14.000\nIt's like, oh, your life is happening right into your nose.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:17.000\nAnd she comes on the podcast and everybody loves her.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:19.000\nShe wrote a poem for a dead eucalyptus tree.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:22.000\nShe represents, like, you know, like, oh, this is real life, man.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\nIt's fucking God is in the moment.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nYou know, you're living in the past and the future.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:28.000\nYou got to keep it real, like your neighbor.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:31.000\nAnd then, like, I was like, thank you so much for doing the show.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:32.000\nPeople love you.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:33.000\nYou should come back any time.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:34.000\nAnd she was like, thanks.\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:36.000\nI have two screenplays for you to read.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:44.000\nSo I didn't have it that wrong.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:48.000\nYour son makes horror mazes for a living now, right?\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:49.000\nLike, that's a weird thing.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:50.000\nI think that's pretty interesting.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:51.000\nI'd like to check back in with him.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:52.000\nI want to go too.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:53.000\nI want to see...\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:56.000\nBecause teenagers have a notoriously small attention span.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:57.000\nLike, you're not supposed to...\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nIf you get into something when you're like 12,\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:01.000\nand you're still into it when you're 16,\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:03.000\nit makes you neither a hero nor a villain,\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nbut it makes you noteworthy.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:06.000\nI want to check in with that guy.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:08.000\nHave you ever gone through one of these horror mazes\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:10.000\nor you just heard them from across the fence?\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:12.000\nI only hear whatever he plays on a loop.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:14.000\nIt's about a 30-second loop that goes\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:15.000\nfor about a month and a half.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:19.000\nOn a scale of 1 to 10,\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:21.000\njust by guessing from meeting him\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:22.000\nand hearing the sounds,\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:25.000\nhow spooktacular do you think they are?\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:27.000\nI don't know.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nI have to imagine a cheap haunted house\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nis a scarier haunted house.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:33.000\nYou've got less restrictions.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nI've been on the Batman ride\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:37.000\nand the American Eagle at Six Flags\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:38.000\ngot America and Illinois.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nThe Batman ride, they strap you in.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nI've used this as a metaphor for things.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:44.000\nThere's something less scary\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nabout having control totally taken from you\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.000\nby a corporation.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nIt's like, oh, you're strapped in.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:53.000\nWorst case scenario is this thing just kind of explodes\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:54.000\nand it's no one's fault,\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nbut when you go on the American Eagle,\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:59.000\nthe world's oldest roller coaster,\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:01.000\nwhich is just part of the psychological,\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:02.000\nthis is just a mind fuck.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:04.000\nIt's the world's oldest roller coaster.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:05.000\nYou're like, what?\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:08.000\nIt's made out of driftwood.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:10.000\nIt's washed over from Coney Island\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nthat was already used for a worse roller coaster\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:14.000\nthat fell apart and that floated over\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:16.000\nand found its way to the Great Lakes.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:18.000\nThey built a roller coaster out of it\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nand they strap a little jump rope across your lap\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nand ask you to hold it real tight.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:26.000\nThe reason that's terrifying is because\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:29.000\nyou can't let go of your sense of accountability.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:32.000\nTerror, and I think this maybe could be thematic\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:33.000\nto our guests tonight,\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nI think a big part of terror is\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:37.000\nhow are you supposed to know\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:39.000\nwhen you're really in trouble\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:41.000\nand can you see death coming\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:44.000\nand if you do, what are you supposed to do?\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:47.000\nIf a roller coaster starts to go wobbly,\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:50.000\nis it going to be my fault if I die\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nbecause I didn't blah blah blah\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.000\nor the people are going to be watching me\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:56.000\non a 4chan video, watching my head fly\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nand going like, look at the dick in the back\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\ndoesn't even move.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nI think it's certainly not your responsibility\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nonce that thing gets rolling.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nWhat a therapist would say.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:12.000\nThat's probably not what the theme park people would say.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:14.000\nIf you can blame a kid for getting eaten\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nby a fucking alligator at Disneyland,\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:20.000\nJesus Christ, the ghost of that kid\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nwas more vilified than Richard Nixon\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:26.000\nbecause God forbid a fucking corporation admit\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:29.000\nthey had anything to do with a fucking alligator.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nFuck you.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:35.000\nIt's so fucking, and it's not Disney that I'm mad at.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nDisney is a system.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:41.000\nIts job is to not have a heart\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nor a brain or a soul.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nIts job is to fucking keep existing.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nWe have systems like that in place,\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.000\nlike the alphabet and medicine\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:52.000\nthat we're very glad aren't like\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:55.000\nonly continued by someone's passion every day.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:58.000\nSo yeah, of course a fucking feeling-less system\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nshould just keep going, you know,\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nbut that's why we have to be on our shit, you know?\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nJust to have a thing.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:06.000\nThere's a guy that says, like, you don't have to,\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:08.000\nit doesn't open you, it's not admissible in court\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nif you say sorry about the alligator.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:15.000\nIf the president has to visit a flood,\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:18.000\nyou know, otherwise he gets, you know, yelled at,\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nlike, you don't care about no flood,\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:23.000\nlike, well, somebody visit the fucking...\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:26.000\nSomebody...\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:28.000\nJust say you're sorry.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nWhat? It said don't go over there.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nIt said don't go over there.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nWas the alligator on the Disney park?\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nWell, the alligator was on.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nIn the water.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nThat was a prime time alligator.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nWhat part of the park was...\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:48.000\nHe had a Mickey Mouse hat, though.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nNo, he didn't have a Mickey Mouse.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:54.000\nHe had a band made, like, but in an area where\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nguests were supposed to keep out.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nWas it part of the animal kingdom part of the park?\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nLike, it was part of the gators.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nIt was swimming anyway.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nIt says no swimming.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nHere's some other places you're not supposed to go\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nin Disneyland. The cash register.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nDo you think they have more than signs\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.000\nkeeping you out of those fucking things?\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:16.000\nUnderground.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:18.000\nThey'll fucking cattle prod you.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nYou try to stick your hand in the till.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:25.000\nDon't... Who cares if there was a goddamn...\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nI don't care.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nWhat are the tickets to that place?\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\n$8,000?\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nThe kid probably had to choose between college\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:37.000\nand Disneyland before it could speak.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nThey're like, I'm sorry.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nYou're going to have to make this choice to hold\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:44.000\njangling a key chain with Mickey Mouse on it\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:47.000\nand holding up one of those hats\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:50.000\nthat I'd know the name of if I went to college.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nMortar and Pestle.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.000\nWhat are those things called?\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nMortar board hat?\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:59.000\nIt's called a Mortar and Pestle.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nThat's where you learn how to make...\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nYou don't know, Mikey, but you're making a choice.\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nYou all live in the moment\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nor be an adult\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nwith a stake in our

34:08.000\nbut isn't this entertainment at the cost\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:10.000\nof a person who died\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\nisn't this and she just kept arguing it\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nand

and\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nalthough this is entertainment to me\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nwhat it actually is\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.000\nis maybe going into the reality\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nof being murdered\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nbeing the person that's in the apartment\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nwhen some fucking dude walks in\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nthe family of the fucking people who have to deal\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nwith this murder that like isn't going to go to trial\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:38.000\nbecause they never find the fucking\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nthe killer or they or it goes to trial\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nand they get fucking off in five years\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nthe other part of our friendship that I think brings a lot\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nto this is that we kind of\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nbonded over vulnerability\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nbeing a thing off Brene Brown\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nthank you fucking god\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nwhen we became friends it was like\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nin this like idea of being super vulnerable\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\naround each other and I think talking about\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:00.000\nhow much we're fascinated and scared\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nand have anxiety over\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\ntrue crime and depression\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:06.000\nis like big part of it\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:08.000\nso you weren't friends until that night when you guys\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:10.000\nmet at that party and talked about that\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nI think we had met like once before but we didn't\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:14.000\nlike hang or but there was not a bond\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:16.000\nso that's your origin story not just the podcast\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:18.000\nbut if you guys being like a duo\n\n35:18.000 --> 35:20.000\nlike a friendship yes that's great\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:22.000\nwe meet over at lunch\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nand talk about our favorite truth\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:26.000\nthe conversation would go that way\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.000\ncan I ask you a question\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nwhat do you think about Nancy Grace\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nI think she is bad\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:34.000\nfor journalism\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:36.000\nI think she is\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:38.000\nthe fact that she focuses\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:40.000\nit's like any small\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nblonde anything that dies\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nthat's when she jumps in front of that camera\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.000\nI rarely see her talking\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.000\nabout people of race and color\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nwhich is so many of these murders\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\nthe more research we do\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\nthere's that real creepy\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:56.000\nand this is what we're talking about\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:58.000\nthese are the things we're stumbling on\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:00.000\nas genuine amateurs\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:02.000\nwhen you talk about women\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.000\nof color who are murdered\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:06.000\ntheir cases you've never fucking heard of\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\neven if you think you're the true crime expert\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.000\nthere's like Georgia did one about a murder\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.000\nin DC that was just like\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:14.000\nit was a bunch of very young black girls\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:16.000\nand it's like not BTK\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:18.000\nand it's certainly not Jombani Randy\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nNancy Grace gets vehement about\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nlike Jodi Arias\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nI don't even know what the fuck that was\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nexcept for that she was\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nblonde before and then a brunette\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nafterwards\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:32.000\nbecause of Nancy Grace\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:34.000\nNancy Grace said I like brunettes\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:36.000\nI also think that when you get that\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\ndefinitive about your opinions\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\nabout what happened and you get that\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:42.000\ndefinitive about what's wrong\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.000\nI think when we talk about these\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.000\ntrue crimes it's exploring\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:48.000\nit's exploring the murders and

48:20.000\ngot drunk and killed this woman\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:22.000\nwho was better than him\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nand he took it away\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\nso I like unsolved

how often it must happen\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:56.000\nbecause for so long\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\nbefore there were computers or whatever\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nand it was just up to whatever\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:02.000\nif a policeman was thorough\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:04.000\nthen things would all get checked\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nand if someone was a little sloppy for whatever reason\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:08.000\nor the policeman didn't have taught\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nhe was the only fucking detective in that\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nunit and the other

49:20.000\nthe DNA on this cold case and on her jacket\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nand the DNA they found on the jacket\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nwas from a perpetrator\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nwho was in prison but was four years old\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:28.000\nwhen the time of the crime took place\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:30.000\nso like clearly\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\ndid he

also performed\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:56.000\nlike secret abortions in that room\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nthat's why they thought he was attached to the doll\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\ndid I go somewhere dark?\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:02.000\nyou didn't do it?\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:04.000\nshe's not the secret abortionist\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:06.000\nyou guys have a murder show\n\n51:06.000 -->

51:16.000\nthere's no way this was from my grammar school\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:18.000\nbut I have this memory of being in the library\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:20.000\nof my grammar school and opening up a book\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nabout John Wayne Gacy\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.000\nand I went to Catholic school so there's no fucking way\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:26.000\nI was in school\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.000\nbut I was somewhere and I opened up a book about John Wayne Gacy\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nand there was\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nan illustrated drawing\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.000\nof where the bodies were\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nin the house\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:38.000\nand someone just\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\noh yeah yeah yeah\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nthat was self-loathing neurologist from over here\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:44.000\noh that's right\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:46.000\nshe's just catching up\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:48.000\nthere were so many drawings\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:50.000\nand it was like underneath it said\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:52.000\nthere were 37 boys\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nor I can't remember if that's the correct total\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.000\nbut somewhere around in the 30s\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:58.000\nand it said found\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:00.000\nthe way they explained it in the house\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.000\nbut I thought it meant in the walls\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:04.000\nand then the way it was drawn\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:06.000\nit looked like there were\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:08.000\npeople in the walls\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:10.000\nthere at the picture for 10 minutes\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nand before that point in my life\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:14.000\nI thought everybody\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:16.000\nwas living the exact same life I was living\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nI thought everybody was middle middle class\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nI thought everybody had\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.000\ntwo parents in their house\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\nI had no fucking clue\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nwhat the real world was like at all\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.000\nso it was this real\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\namazing it was like an epiphany\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:32.000\nbut the scary version of an epiphany\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:34.000\nbecause I suddenly was like\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:36.000\nthere are grown men out there\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\nwith boys and put them in the walls of his house\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nbut if you hide enough boys\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nin the walls think of the savings\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:44.000\non heating cars\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.000\nthey are the perfect\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nbecause they have a vacuum inside of them\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:50.000\nJeff\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.000\nwhen you\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:54.000\nthink of the savings\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:56.000\nwhy can't we\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\nI like the savings\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nwhen you fixate on the John Wayne Gacy murders\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\nso you've probably fixated that\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:04.000\non the timelines\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:06.000\nhe's still alive right\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:08.000\nJohn Wayne Gacy, he died in jail\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:10.000\nbut after a long while\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\nover and over again\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nit's like a rare case of a fountain\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:16.000\nof knowledge about\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:18.000\nJohn Wayne Gacy because he just hung out\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:20.000\nand kept answering questions\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:22.000\nand then what\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:24.000\nand I've read some of that stuff\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:26.000\nso when you're reading those accounts\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nhe kept bringing boys back\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nto his house and then\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:32.000\nto talk about magic\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:34.000\nthe big thing was\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:36.000\nthe rope trick\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:38.000\nthe handcuff trick\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:40.000\nwhen you're hearing that story\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:42.000\nthat for me\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:44.000\nI'm pouring over that\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:46.000\nand I'm like\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nI am thinking\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\nof\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\nI think I'm getting a glimpse of\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nvictim and murderer\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.000\nbecause\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:58.000\nthe murderer is a boy\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:00.000\nmaybe\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nbut I also\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:04.000\nmaybe that's just like\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:06.000\ndo you detect a difference there\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:08.000\nbecause the victims are\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:10.000\na different gender\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:12.000\nbecause that would be valuable data\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\nin my dumb thesis from earlier\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:16.000\nI guess\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:18.000\nin this case I didn't just because\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:20.000\nthey kept using the word boy\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.000\nso it felt like\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:24.000\nmy school\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\na man murdered boys\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:28.000\nthat would be my age\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:30.000\nand put

was just like this book\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:38.000\nbut also\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:40.000\nwhat I immediately also went into\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:42.000\nis like that moment where he's\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:44.000\nit's the guy that owns the construction company\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\nwho says hey you did good work today\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:48.000\nI'll buy you a beer come over to my

01:04:26.000\nis that a real thing\n\n01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000\ndo we somehow\n\n01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nI think there's a way that that could be\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000\ntrue in some general\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000\nin some general swaths\n\n01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000\nI'm definitely not educated enough to speak\n\n01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000\non this except for\n\n01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000\nan alligator we tend to\n\n01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nblame the kid\n\n01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000\nwe tend to figure out why it's not that\n\n01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000\nbad an alligator and not that bad\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000\nof a corporation and I'm sorry but\n\n01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000\nI'm trying to be Jonom Chomsky about it\n\n01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000\nbut we have a bias there\n\n01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000\nif somebody gets killed\n\n01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nby a lawnjerk we tend to side\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000\nwith the lawnjerk\n\n01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nespecially if it means lawnjerk get recalled\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000\nwe go like another fucking piece of\n\n01:05:02.000

01:05:10.000\nwhat are lawnjerk\n\n01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000\nwe're a deadly weapon\n\n01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000\nthat used to be able to play with\n\n01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000\noh lawnjarts\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000\nwith a J\n\n01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000\nyou could throw a javelin at your friends\n\n01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nand it would land in somebody's throat\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nand kill them\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000\nso they did two rounds of these\n\n01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000\nthey did lawnjarts and then lawndarts\n\n01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000\nand they were like we gotta stop with lawn\n\n01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nit was like if you played\n\n01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000\ncornhole the beanbag game\n\n01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nI know all about lawndarts I did not know about lawnjarts\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000\nthat's crazy\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000\n1980 when were you born\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000\nthey were giant lead poles\n\n01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nwith plastic fins on them\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000\nthat were designed for airtime\n\n01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nand for penetrating the human skull\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000\nright so anyways\n\n01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000\nwe tend to side\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nagainst the victim so I think\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nthat it's even before you get into\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000\ngender politics it's like\n\n01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nthe potential for bias\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nexists in this like where is\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nit coming from and what is it\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000\npersonally I think it's the journalism\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nI think it's what story sells\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000\nand what's the most exciting\n\n01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000\nyou have a child that's\n\n01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nin beauty pageants\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nit's a 6 year old dressed up as a 35 year old secretary\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nand she is murdered\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nwe've been talking about it\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000\nfor 20 years\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000\nand that's because that is the ultimate\n\n01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000\nthat the news can bring that up and sell\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000\n2 million magazines easy\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nyou see it constantly it's like in touch\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nonce a month has a jambanay story\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000\nand it's the oldest story there is\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000\npart of the fascination with that is that it was a fucking rich\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000\na rich white family\n\n01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nand so like\n\n01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000\npart of the reason it's never been solved and was such\n\n01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000\na big deal is because those people got away\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nwith it because they were a rich white family\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nbut within that\n\n01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000\ncertainly if it bleeds it leads\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000\nwhile we're leading the bleeding\n\n01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000\nare we also\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nlacing everything\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000\nwith some kind of fiber optic cable\n\n01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000\nthat sends the message that\n\n01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nyou know\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nwell she left her house\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nand isn't that\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000\ndoesn't it just come back to\n\n01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nit's a holdover from\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000\ntelevision as I've always said\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000\nit's an appliance\n\n01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nif you talk to your refrigerator it'll tell you\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000\nnothing's cold enough and

brown\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nand that's not necessarily true\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000\nI like it's attitude\n\n01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nit's just that the television happens to be able\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000\nto talk to you\n\n01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000\nand does its job as a appliance\n\n01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000\nand the television would tell you\n\n01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000\nnot enough people are sitting right in front of me\n\n01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nglued to me afraid to ever\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000\nstop watching me

that's really\n\n01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000\nspecifically about a\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000\ntime\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nbroadcast era thing of\n\n01:08:08.000 -->

women on your jury\n\n01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000\nif they are the most at risk\n\n01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000\nif they are the most\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000\nis there a horrible\n\n01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000\nis there anything\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000\nbehind that Wheel of Fortune\n\n01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nletter?\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000\nbecause he was saying you do want black women on your jury?\n\n01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000\nthat's what the thesis\n\n01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000\nof his monologue was\n\n01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nand he didn't really\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000\nI don't know if that was based on anything\n\n01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000\nI'm scared to incriminate myself\n\n01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000\nI don't know\n\n01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000\nI guess\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000\nmaybe if I was going to\n\n01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000\nspeculate and get a\n\n01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000\npodcast suicide\n\n01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000\nI guess I would be trying to get into\n\n01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000\nthe area of\n\n01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nis there a victim signal\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nsent through media\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000\nit's like you deserve it\n\n01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000\nand is that so fucking\n\n01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000\nwould that be actually so effective\n\n01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000\nthat it would carry over into your outside watching television\n\n01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000\nlife and into everything that you do\n\n01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000\ncan you really just\n\n01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000\nbut I think that it goes\n\n01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000\nto the individual because there's so many\n\n01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000\neven in that grim sleeper documentary\n\n01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000\nthat fucking woman Pam\n\n01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000\nhe drove around with was such a badass\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000\nshe was\n\n01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nshe had lived life, she knew that whole neighborhood\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000\nshe knew the guy, I think she had been his victim\n\n01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000\nit was\n\n01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000\nan amazing example of\n\n01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nI think that the storyline\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000\nmight be victim but I don't think\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000\nthe reality for the average\n\n01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000\nwoman is victim and I think that's kind of the\n\n01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000\nI think that's the thing that's bubbling up in all of this\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000\nis like now that everybody\n\n01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000\nhas more of a voice on the internet\n\n01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000\nand people get to kind of say their shit, yes there's fighting\n\n01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000\nyes there's Gamergate, yes people\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000\nthere are people who want to hate\n\n01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nother, they want to other people\n\n01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000\nso that they can get away from themselves\n\n01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000\nbut ultimately what's coming up\n\n01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000\nout of all of this is strength\n\n01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000\nand a voice and people that are watching\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000\nother people speak for themselves\n\n01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000\nand then maybe they didn't have a strong mother\n\n01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000\nor a strong father\n\n01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nmaybe they didn't have any good example\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000\nbut they're watching people online going yeah that's how I feel\n\n01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000\nyeah that's fuck this shit\n\n01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nlike I don't have to do what I was maybe\n\n01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000\nyou had a mother who raised you to be like\n\n01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000\nyou be polite no matter what\n\n01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000\nyou still are an individual that can make that decision for yourself\n\n01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000\nwell I mean\n\n01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000\nyeah we get it\n\n01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000\nthat's really it at the end of the day\n\n01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000\nand it's like and so\n\n01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000\nthere can be evolution I think\n\n01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nbecause of the way\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000\nkind of\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nthe internet is and just kind of the way\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000\npeople are connected these days\n\n01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000\nyou have neuroplasticity my therapist says\n\n01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000\nI can be a douchebag at 27 when I'm talking to you\n\n01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000\nand like I can\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000\nslowly like force myself\n\n01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000\nto\n\n01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000\nthink differently it's actually possible\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000\ngiraffes can't do it, they can't do it\n\n01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000\nbut I mean that's the thing is\n\n01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000\nyou can see course correction\n\n01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000\nonline and people are slowly\n\n01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000\nI think slowly learning\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nthat you can fuck up badly\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nand still go sorry I was wrong\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000\nyou can oftentimes people do it\n\n01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000\nbecause they write a think piece or they do whatever\n\n01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000\nbut it's like going it's like that\n\n01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000\nLindy West story where the guy was harassing her\n\n01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000\nto the point where he was emailing her\n\n01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000\nasking her what he if he\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000\nif she thought her dead father was\n\n01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000\nashamed of her or some really intense\n\n01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000\nreally personal trolling\n\n01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000\nshe called him on the phone and said\n\n01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000\nhey I found out it's you\n\n01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000\nwhy did you do this and he had this whole\n\n01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000\nthing of like I'm so sorry\n\n01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000\nand like it's that thing of like internet trolls\n\n01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000\nthat's just as real as the internet\n\n01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000\nand the moment and the time that's taking place\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000\nthere's a real human being on the other side of that\n\n01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nthere's real human beings on the other side\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000\nof all of these things and I think\n\n01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000\npeople are slowly starting to learn that\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nand at first it takes the form\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000\nof something that feels\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000\ndehumanizing to the wrong people at the wrong time\n\n01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000\nI think one of the big ironies is\n\n01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000\nyou have the Spock demographic\n\n01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000\nlet's I'll claim\n\n01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000\nambassadorship

01:27:46.000\nalways felt like an underdog always very\n\n01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nprideful about the fact that he always\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nknew how the systems worked and why they were\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000\nunfair and all these things suddenly being\n\n01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000\ntold oh you don't know nothing\n\n01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000\nit's hard being this it's hard being that\n\n01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000\nyou have this weird impulse where you're like\n\n01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000\noh wait a minute logic should rule the day\n\n01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000\nit always has for me in spite of getting beat up\n\n01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nin gym class logic always prevails\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nso why are you being so illogical about this\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000\nand then you're hearing somebody go like\n\n01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000\nthat's what the fucking person just said to

not very logical meet meet meet\n\n01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000\nand that's what's happening right now\n\n01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000\nis these like as this water table rises\n\n01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000\nbut I do I\n\n01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000\nI think I'm hearing an optimistic\n\n01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000\nmessage here and I share it like I\n\n01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000\nfeel

01:51:34.800\nCameras out and ready to roll.\n\n01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:36.480\nTaking it all down, but I mean.\n\n01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:38.320\nIt's called the nightcrawler spirit.\n\n01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:42.000\nWe're all gonna make $500.\n\n01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.760\nBut I truly believe that I think that\n\n01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:45.520\nthat's the true instinct of people.\n\n01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:48.400\nIf you've gone to a certain direction\n\n01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:50.520\nto shut that down, that's your choice,\n\n01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:51.880\nbut that is not common.\n\n01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:54.760\nThat is not, I don't think that's the common human thing.\n\n01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:56.640\nPlaintlets rush toward an open climate.\n\n01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:57.960\nThat's what's great about it.\n\n01:51:57.960 --> 01:51:59.920\nIt's healing, we wanna heal.\n\n01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:02.320\nWe're lucky to be, like all of us here,\n\n01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:05.320\nlike we are doing a stupid podcast\n\n01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:06.880\nand do comedy with microphones up here,\n\n01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:08.760\nbut the fact that a group of people all come here\n\n01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:11.600\njust to sit around in a group of strangers and laugh,\n\n01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:13.000\nthat's really magnificent.\n\n01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:13.840\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:14.680\nIt really is crazy.\n\n01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:15.880\nIt says a lot about underwear.\n\n01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:19.440\nAnd the state of it, like these people\n\n01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:21.040\nhad to hang out for two hours\n\n01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:23.800\nin whatever they left the house in.\n\n01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:27.480\nSome of them probably chose cotton from a hains or play text.\n\n01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:29.840\nBut they didn't know, they didn't know, they couldn't know.\n\n01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:31.920\nNo, they couldn't have known until they came here tonight.\n\n01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:33.120\nThere's a new thing.\n\n01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:35.080\nCotton is dumb.\n\n01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:36.880\nCotton's dead, Cotton's dead.\n\n01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:39.240\nCotton is the murder victim of fabrics.\n\n01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:42.160\nYou should dismiss it.\n\n01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:42.920\nWhat, did I not get it?\n\n01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:43.680\nNo, no, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:44.160\nDid I?\n\n01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:46.200\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Cotton's dead.\n\n01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:47.360\nNo, I think you get it.\n\n01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:51.240\nCotton murders, Cotton murders your comfort.\n\n01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:52.080\nCotton's the bad guy.\n\n01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:53.640\nIt deserves it, and it deserves it.\n\n01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:54.120\nYeah.\n\n01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:55.480\nDo you guys remember, we've talked, I think,\n\n01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:56.520\nremember the Noid?\n\n01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:58.600\nHave you got, remember the Noid thing?\n\n01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:00.280\nOh yeah, from Domino's?\n\n01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:02.760\nDomino's Pizza had a Noid, a Noid, and he was like,\n\n01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:05.280\noh, careful of the Noid wants your pizza to be cold.\n\n01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:09.480\nThere was a guy that worked for, his name was Noid,\n\n01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:11.240\nand the reason they dropped that ad campaign\n\n01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:15.000\nis because that guy thought they were talking about him.\n\n01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.720\nAnd he went and killed people.\n\n01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:18.040\nI don't think that worked.\n\n01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:19.640\nOoh, I'm doing that one.\n\n01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:20.400\nSo look it up.\n\n01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:23.040\nI apologize in advance if he snopes it.\n\n01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:26.120\nHeld up at Domino's and no one died, but uh.\n\n01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:26.920\nWait, sorry, OK.\n\n01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:28.280\nHe held up at Domino's?\n\n01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:29.440\nWas it Domino's, right?\n\n01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:30.840\nWhat are you telling?\n\n01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:31.920\nWhat?\n\n01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:33.760\nWas he a Domino's employee?\n\n01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:34.600\nNo.\n\n01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:36.400\nHe was a dude whose name was Noid, right?\n\n01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:39.520\nYeah, he was like, you guys can't keep telling people\n\n01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:40.360\nto avoid me.\n\n01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:41.520\nThis has gone far enough.\n\n01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:42.720\nIt's that thing of like.\n\n01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:45.440\nI'm going to

01:53:51.000\nand you're like, make sure the FBI aren't following\n\n01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.800\nthat guy before you tell him that he's crazy.\n\n01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:55.160\nAnd then it's like Noid was like, the fucking TV's talking\n\n01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:56.640\nto me, and it's like, no, they're actually talking.\n\n01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:58.080\nThey're telling people to avoid
