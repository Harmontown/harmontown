00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, the Nerdist Theater, Melty, Melty Theater,

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Harmontown, is now in session.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Let's just get this thing rolling.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
The mayor of Harmontown is Dan Harmon.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Thank you.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
I'm very, very, very sorry that Spencer is not with us tonight.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Is he okay?

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Well, I mean, he'll be fine.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
You know, he rarely, as you know, he doesn't call in sick.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
He said he had a headache that was so bad.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Like, if he wanted to fake something, he could fake better than a headache.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
But he said, yeah, it's a headache that's so bad that it's actually making him kind of nauseous and stuff.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
So I said, hey man, just as long as you feed the cat.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
He's still under your employee, but he has that.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
He really did still have to. He didn't have to. He could have bowed out of that too.

01:14.000 --> 01:24.000
All he had to do was hand off the cat instructions and medicine regimens and things to the cat sitter.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
I'm writing in a hotel right now with Chris McKenna, like, trying desperately to finish a pilot before I leave for the holidays.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
You guys don't care.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
Why the hotel? Why not the two distracting at home?

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
Well, no. I mean, Chris is allergic to the dogs and stuff.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
So then he starts sneezing and wheezing and there's just dander everywhere.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
It doesn't matter if you lock the dogs out.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
What hotel are you standing at?

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
The Redberry.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
What room?

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Before that, we were at a place in West Hollywood.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
We keep getting hotel suites and trying to finish this thing.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
I'm sure we've spent more on hotel suites than we would ever make on the TV show.

02:09.000 --> 02:17.000
But anyways, continuing the apology department, I'm very sorry about last week's show.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I thought it was a good show.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
I listened to it. I was a little embarrassed.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
I was just one of those really, really drunk shows.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I thought Rob was very funny.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
I was a little obnoxious.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I was a little combative, you pointed out.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I was a little angry.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
I was picking fights and stuff.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
I was definitely slurring my words and it was kind of like out of it.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
So tonight you've made a vow to not drink during the show.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Well, if I started...

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
Jeff said to stand hoisted a red solo cup to his mouth.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
I only get that kind of drink if I've been drinking since like 9am.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
So you're just kicking off right now?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah, exactly.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Put the pedal to the metal, baby.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Yeah, we could butt chug and I would be fine.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Kids don't butt chug.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Adults do butt chug.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
It's Christmastime in Los Angeles, all of the...

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
Oh my God, please just go into like a burr alive song right now.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
I heard myself sounding too...

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
They say prancer and dancer.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
All the assistants are gone already.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
That's how you can tell it's Christmastime in Los Angeles.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Some things are just desolate and...

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
I really like LA.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Who's staying in town for the holidays?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
You guys are lucky.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Don't get tricked into thinking that you have to go places.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
I've been going places every Christmas for the last four or five years probably.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
It's been a million years since I...

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Or four or five, which just caught me in my math.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
If you just stay still in Los Angeles, it's one of the most beautiful holidays you'll ever have.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Go to the roost, have an eggnog, as we always say.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Everywhere you go, it's just like...

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Because everybody else fucks off and then you just like...

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
It's LA the way it probably...

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
It's like a two week long Coachella where all the assholes are gone.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
It's probably nice in New York too, where I'm going.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
And where you'll be joining me.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I'll be there too?

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Are you going to be there for Christmas or after Christmas?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah, I'm coming just after.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
The whole Shibootz.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
The whole Shibootz?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I didn't know you spoke Yiddish.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Yep.

04:32.000 --> 04:41.000
All the Mishigas.

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
Jeff, are you aware of Snapchat?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
I would be lying if I said I knew anything about it.

04:51.000 --> 05:03.000
Snapchat is a new thing for millennials that empowers them by virtue of temporary media

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
storage to show their impulsive side.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
How often have you been at Disneyland and been drunk with your friends on turkey leg

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
and just wanted to express that and then thought...

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
You know that most of the turkey leg is Facebook?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
It's emu.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
A lot of that turkey leg is emu.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
That was not where it's interrupting me.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
Yeah, but Dan, you're in the pocket of big turkey.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Yes, it's emu.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
The turkey leg's emu.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Sorry, go ahead.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
We'll get back to the emus.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Say, if the kids are out there and you're feeling good and you're having a good time,

05:37.000 --> 05:46.000
you're at one of your foam parties or your hologram jerk-offs.

05:46.000 --> 05:57.000
Where the hologram jerks you off into a cup that's off the grid.

05:57.000 --> 06:07.000
Before you take a bike ride with your dog and put your phone in a box.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
You might think, oh, I just want to express this, but you put it on Facebook.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
And how do you know if 20 years from now when you're running for senator,

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
you know, it's not going to be politically incorrect to say,

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
What's up, G-Hards?

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
I'm riding a bike with my dog.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
Is the dog on his own bike or is he in a basket like 18?

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
Dog's in the basket with your phone.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
Snapchat lets you say stuff like that and then it's like, oh, it'll be gone in a little bit.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
How long does it exist?

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, there's a lot of different functionality that they've been adding to Snapchat, Jeff.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
There's your standard foundational dick pic technology, which is not dick pic proof.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
We're not talking about dick pics. That's always been a zero sum game.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
People can screen grab your dick pics.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Snapchat will notify you that your dick pic has been grabbed.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
And it will say who grabbed your dick pic?

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
It'll say Jeff Davis grabbed your pic, yes, and you'll go like, hmm, interesting.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
And then we're not friends anymore unless we have a conversation.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Oh, maybe I wanted you to grab my dick.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
The night is very young.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
These new courtship rituals are erupting out of this stuff.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
So it's videos, pictures, both? Either one?

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
And then it lives, how long does it live?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
10 seconds?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
24 hours, depending on how you...

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Well, like I said, there's two different functionalities.

07:38.000 --> 07:47.000
I can just take a picture or a video, and I can send it to as many of my friends' followers as I want.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
Those people can watch it once or now if they pay a nominal fee.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Wait, what?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Twice.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
You can monetize your Snapchats?

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Well, no. Snapchat can monetize Snapchat.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
The other functionality is something I find very interesting called My Story.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
That's what I've been snapping.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
Because you sent me a text that was you opening your mouth in a video and a rainbow barfing out of your mouth.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
That was just an example of Snapchat's amazing add-ons, like visual effects.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
But does that go away off of my phone in 24 hours?

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
No, no, no, I saved that. I made that. You can save your own shit.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Ah, gotcha.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
But my story thing is like a 24-hour buffer.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
It's like a treadmill, and so anything that you made 24 hours ago, that goes off the end of the treadmill.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
You never see that again.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
So you just, like, anything you make in 24 hours, that's available to...

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
That's your story. People can click on that and go,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Oh, look what Marissa's been doing over the last...

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Great, I'm glad you could make it.

08:48.000 --> 08:58.000
Well, I'm sure I did the most horrifying entrance and exits at the same time.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
I'm up here talking about fucking Snapchat, waiting for this prick.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah, you're up here making podcast dynamite.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
I hope that Rob just kept that movement and he's walking out to his car and never returns.

09:12.000 --> 09:19.000
That he was in the audience and now he's calling an Uber?

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
That's his story.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
That's his story.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
That's Rob's Snapchat story.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
He has become Snapchat.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
He really is.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
He's self-srobbing, self-snapchatting.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
We call Schrab Snapchat now.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
I don't know why I have this open.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
The bad part is comedy works in threes, so we know that's coming back.

09:48.000 --> 09:55.000
I've subscribed to Pornhub Premium.

09:55.000 --> 10:01.000
I gotta say, Dan...

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
Can I just say this?

10:05.000 --> 10:13.000
As much as we love Erin McGathy and Misser, single you is a lot more exciting.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Snapping your chats?

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
Oh, by the way, I hope you don't think that he's divorced since he's Snapchatting

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
because he's trying to creep on.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I don't know if Snapchat you can use.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Can you creep on Snapchat?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
I don't know.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
That's not what I'm doing at all.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
It's narcissistic.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
I have eight followers on Snapchat.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
I've been Snapchatting. If you caught my story in the last 24 hours,

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
you would have seen the process of me trying to write a pilot with Chris McKenna

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
in a hotel room for 48 hours.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
But now it's gone.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Because I blew it. I didn't write it.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
What is the allure? Do you follow anybody on Snapchat?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Are you following Chris McKenna or anybody else?

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
I follow my dog, Bordr.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
The guy I'm leaving my dogs with when I go to New York.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
He has a Snapchat.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
You want to know what he's up to?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Well, you click on him and he's like,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I'm in Laurel Canyon.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
And the dogs are like,

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
Can I write down that guy's Snapchat address?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
This sounds like good shit.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I don't know how that works.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Is that private?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I don't know.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
What would be the allure of me as a friend of yours following you on Snapchat?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
What's for sale there?

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
The inside look into the comings and goings of my comings and goings?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Like, I don't know.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Which brings us back to porn.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
It's like a video Twitter feed.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
And I haven't been on Twitter in weeks.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
The only bad thing about not being on Twitter has been that

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
it's the only place you would go to say something like,

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
my life is going so well not being on Twitter.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
It really is something you want to just express to the world,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
which Twitter is really good for.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Not being on Twitter is awesome.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
What am I doing?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
It's the disposable nature of Snapchat.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
The fact that things don't exist for good unless somebody screen grabs your dick.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
I assume that's the allure for millennials.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I'm a Gen Xer.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Died in the wool.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
I love archiving.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
I'd like to think that all my stuff lasts forever.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
But you know what?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
You gotta recognize.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Jeff, CDs, VHS.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
And also, here's another thing that's fleeting,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
because I have some sad news for everybody.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Well, it's sad news for me.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
It'll be fodder for you.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
I, as you know, have had a 15-year...

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Je ne sais quoi.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
You know, a relationship,

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
my longest sexual relationship with a bent plastic mannequin leg,

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
size six-foot, made for hosiery displays,

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
in some golden age where hosiery displays needed to be anatomically perfect.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Bent to what degree?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
What posture is that leg?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Bent at the knee, like...

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
How many degrees?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Like, paleo.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
It was like bouncing a...

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
I mean, what do you...

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Really?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Okay.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
I got you.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Weirdest question to have, I think.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
I feel that's the weirdest question you could have.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Is it slightly bent, or is it bent like 45 degrees?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
It's bent, like 90 degrees.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Okay.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Basically, 90 degrees.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Okay, got you.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
So, you guys know the drill.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
You put the hosiery on the leg.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
You take your shirt off,

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
exposing your gigantic, ursine, oily, zip-covered,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
hut-like frame.

13:41.000 --> 13:48.000
You warble into bed, like a pasty cloud.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
We have our episode title.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
Like a beached albino porpoise.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
And then you either watch some porn.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Maybe you even don't.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Maybe you're kind of feeling like a little crazy,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
and you just want to focus on the leg.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Sometimes you combine the leg with the porn?

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Yeah.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Okay.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
But it doesn't really work if you're watching,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
like, people go fully at it, and then you're like,

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
and then there's this leg.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
I usually, what I'll do is, if I'm watching something

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
with the leg, I will watch a YouTube channel

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
called Legs Lavish.

14:29.000 --> 14:37.000
It's your one-stop shop for honest reviews of hosiery

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
for women by women.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
It's by women.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
The comment section is like fake women's names

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
and just honest guys' names.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Talking about...

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Those are great.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Try it some more.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
Review some more hosiery for me.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Legs Lavish.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Check it out on YouTube.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Alright, so sometimes you're watching the movie,

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
sometimes it's just you and the leg.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
I recommend Alicia.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
She's got a professional edge,

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
and she has some winter outfits that are like...

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
She puts on a little yarn cap and gloves

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
and a cashmere scarf and a sweater,

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
a short skirt, but not slutty short.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Like a little bit above the knee,

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
and then these little boots,

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
and then these, of course, the tights that she's reviewing,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
these winter tights.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
And then I might...

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
Maybe I'll rub a mannequin leg on my nipple while I watch that.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
And I'll go, that's a good review, Alicia.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Do you prefer...

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
Do you prefer or favor one nipple over the other?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
That's usually going to end up being my left nipple.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Who knows why?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Maybe because I'm right-brained.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
No, it's because you're jerking off with your right hand

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
because you're right-handed.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Oh, yeah!

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
All right, I can't remember.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Okay, so here's the bad news.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
The bad news!

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Yeah.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Fucking...

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Buckle your holy shitbelts, everybody.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
This is the part where you're going to feel sorry for him.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
Up until now, you've been Abraham Lincoln.

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
My life's going to take a dark turn in a minute.

16:29.000 --> 16:39.000
I haven't used, you know, old faithful since I got it out after the divorce.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
And during the marriage, I adopted two dogs.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
And so I...

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Hello, Spaghetti-o!

16:48.000 --> 16:56.000
So Nigel, who loves eating underwear and shoes and pens and cat food cans

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
and ninja stars and rocks and cat shit

17:01.000 --> 17:08.000
and fucking leaf blower wires and couches and his own shit

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
but not enough paper towels on the roll

17:13.000 --> 17:20.000
and the fucking window cells and blankets and the stairs.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
He eats everything.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
Why would I think it was okay to rub a mannequin leg on my nipple and then go to work?

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Just leave it there, laying on the bed.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Nigel took old faithful down?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
He chewed...

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
He chewed exactly precisely.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
He chewed the big toe.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
That's your nipple toe!

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
That's your nipple toe!

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Turning it into a gnarled...

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
Like, the look of it...

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Not the texture, because this would be soft

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
but the look of it is like a corn cob with no corn on it.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Like, because it's just all...

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Yeah.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
But it's all hard-chewed plastic.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Have you tried that out?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
No, I can't even...

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
It's gross to even look at.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
Everything that's sexy about this whole thing is just smoothness and softness

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
and, of course, autonomy and creepiness.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
But now it's a gnarled, like, an enemy.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
Was there ever a time that Nigel walked in on you while you were doing that?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Was there some sort of jealousy?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
It was like, pay more attention than me.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
I'm going to eat this toe off of this fucking guy.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Like, I told you, he eats everything.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Okay.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
He cast a white net.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
That's so sad.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
No, I don't think I can replace it.

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
That thing, like I told you, I had to humiliate myself at a weird West Covino warehouse

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
or something.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
All right.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Let's move on.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
One more question.

18:48.000 --> 18:54.000
How often do you, like, go in and restock the hosiery?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Like, you go into...

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Never.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
Like, I'm saying, like, before this happened, like, is this a monthly, weekly, yearly...

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Well, it depends.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
I mean, what do you mean?

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
Because the question should be how much do I buy when I buy it.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Right, yeah.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Like, there was a time before Amazon Prime...

19:08.000 --> 19:14.000
Andy?

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Lethal weapon?

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Lethal weapon.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
The, you know, you would have to...

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
If it's just a pervert going into Albertsons, you're...

19:28.000 --> 19:35.000
You got to walk out with, like, a little package of something and, like, it looks like maybe

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
you could be buying it for a wife that's waiting at home and then you also have to do the fake

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
toothpaste and the fake, like, paper towel roll or something, like, oh, boy, I need so

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
many random things.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
But you can't get 30 of those stockings.

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
I'm a better man than I could, maybe, and look at the cashier and say, I like to jerk

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
off on a mannequin, like, I'll see you next summer.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Because I'm buying in bulk.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Did we talk about...

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
But with Amazon, I just...

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Cha-ching.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
But no more.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
No more.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
No more.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Because the things...

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
You're not going to try to replace it?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Look, man, just...

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
What did I...

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
We're talking in circles.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
No, no, I'm saying...

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
There's no replacing it.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
It's one of a kind.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
Did you ever see Cherry 2000, the movie with Melanie Griffith and...

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I lost my Cherry 2000.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
I would have to go fight Tim Thomerson in the wasteland to get...

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
Just watch it and get some culture.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
If Harmontown can leave you with one message, just get some culture.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
These poor kids, they have nothing.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
What do you got?

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
Thumb drives full of Wi-Fi's.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Isn't it possible to...

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
And again, I'm not trying to...

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
Tim Thomerson, look him up.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
You're saying now it's hard to go out and replace that because it's hard for you to

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
go into a store in West Covina and buy that mannequin leg.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
Or are you saying that was just so singular and special that it's irreplaceable?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
No, I would...

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
No, I'm podcasting about it.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
I would walk in with a marching band if I could find another model.

21:10.000 --> 21:18.000
I would go, sir, I'm here for one thing alone, for one reason.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
But I just think I'm busy now and trying to develop TV shows and stuff.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
So who's got the time?

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Interesting.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
All right.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
The end of an era.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
How many years was Old Faithful with you?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Fifteen years.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
It's got to be like fifteen, I think.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Fourteen, something.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Longest relationship I've ever had with anything.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
Was Old Faithful in the menagerie at your old Hollywood place?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Absolutely.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Yeah.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
It was the only one that survived because everything else didn't do anything.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
Full mannequins.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Sorry, ladies.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
There's nothing to you.

21:54.000 --> 22:00.000
If you could restore and have Old Faithful back without the gnarled corn cob toe,

22:00.000 --> 22:09.000
or five real dolls, kind of like an endless supply of real dolls,

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
would you rather have the fleeting experience of the latex real doll

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
or have Old Faithful back in its pristine form?

22:17.000 --> 22:24.000
I mean, come on, you're talking about like a $30,000 real doll value that could probably be,

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
I don't know, that's crazy.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
That's a crazy question.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
I'm sure I could, I would really have to think about it because...

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
It's a good question then.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
Especially if I could get the fully extended one back,

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
because remember I had the fully extended one and then the bent one.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
What happened to the fully extended one?

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
Over the years it just, you make sacrifices because girlfriends go,

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
what are these?

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
And you go, I rub them on my nipple.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I used to.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Are you going to again?

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Do you want me to rub them on your nipple?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
No.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Do you want to keep them?

23:00.000 --> 23:06.000
Well, that would be to imply the possibility of life after you.

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
But maybe the smaller one that's...

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
You make up very much storage space and...

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
Hide that in your golf bag.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
Let's bring out Rob Schrab.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Oh, yeah.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
Coming over, baby, in and by you.

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
Turned out she's somebody else's touch.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Could be trouble, but could be fun.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
Could be fun, baby.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
Even if you're hot.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Oh, Rob has a mysterious bag.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Snapchat.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Snapchat.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Hey, Rob, how you doing, man?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
I'm doing okay.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
How are you?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
I'm very well, thank you.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Brought to you by Lassens.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
You have a bag from Lassens?

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
The Mormon health food store in Los Feliz?

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Yes.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
They keep very weird hours and there's 17 aisles that have chips in it.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
There's no...

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
Oh, sorry.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
I did not try to tee you up for that.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
But that's not what's in the bag.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Am I right?

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I ran out of chips, so I'm here.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
What's in the bag?

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Is this a reveal that we have to say for later?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
What's in the bag?

24:33.000 --> 24:40.000
I was cleaning up and I found all of the models from the G.I. Joe episode commercial.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
I was going to give it to Steve Levy or Spencer and neither one of them are here.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
So I can't trust it with you because it'll be in an Uber somewhere.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
So I'm going to have to take this home.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
So I took an Uber somewhere the other day.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Okay.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Yesterday.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Yes.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
I took it to the Redberry Hotel.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Redberry.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Ah, the Redberry.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
Where the celebrities sleep.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
The Redberry.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
You're already home.

25:13.000 --> 25:19.000
And as we pulled up to the location, welcome to the Redberry.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
The guy...

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
Should we reenact your arrival at the Redberry?

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
I'd prefer to tell my story first.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
And then we'll reenact it.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
And then we'll reenact it.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Yeah, yeah.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
And then we'll get different periods in history and we'll do your Redberry story as that was

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
set during a while.

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
All I ask is to be able to just tell my story.

25:39.000 --> 25:48.000
The driver, as we pulled up to the Redberry, he started saying over and over again, pull

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
up the Uber map.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
Pull up the Uber map and give to me.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I put in code.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
I put in code.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
He's just repeating these phrases.

26:00.000 --> 26:08.000
He wanted me to give him my phone so he could put in a promotional code so as he put it,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
he could give me a 20% discount.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
And I kept saying, I don't want.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I don't like this.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Tell me the code.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
20% discount.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
And I said, but I don't...

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
You can tell me the code.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Give me the idol.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
They can't just give me phone.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
I put in code.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Give me the idol.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
I was like, I don't want to give you my phone.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I don't know you.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
It's my phone.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
And he's like, 20%.

26:37.000 --> 26:48.000
I said, I would like to pay you 40% extra to stop asking me for my personal property after

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
giving me a ride to a hotel.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
It's close to a mugging.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
If I felt like I needed to give it to you, then you'd be mugging me.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
His concern was that if he tells you the code, you're going to tell everybody at Harmontown

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
what the code is?

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Well, I've heard stories and maybe somebody can...

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Rumors.

27:09.000 --> 27:15.000
I thought I heard a story from somebody that I couldn't recall.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
But I had this post-it note in my head about this whole give me your phone.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I'm going to put in a code thing.

27:22.000 --> 27:29.000
I thought I remembered the story being they upgrade your ride to lux or looper-duper or

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
something.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
They do some weird shit.

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
There can't be a system in place where they need to touch your phone.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Shit.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
If it's one thing, it's another.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I tell you, man.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Yeah, man.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Shit, man.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
Those Uber drivers are really getting me down, too.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
It's oppressive.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
So oppressive.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Ah, man.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Trump.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
This shit.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Still going on.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Uber drivers.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Promotional cozy.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
24, man.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Door-dash.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Tinder.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Snapchat.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Door-dash.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Door-dash.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
Door-dash, jeans, all that stuff.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Man.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
You don't use Snapchat, do you?

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
I don't even know what that is.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
I consider myself a snappist.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
You brought me out.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Why again?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Because you brought, let's bring out Rob.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Hey, how are you doing?

28:34.000 --> 28:43.000
Let me tell you something about my day yesterday.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
Well, what is the proper way to use you in a show?

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
You asked me to come.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
What?

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Yeah, you're very...

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
That's not my issue.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
The kids like you.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
The kids like you.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Then use me.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Use me properly.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
That's not my problem.

28:59.000 --> 29:08.000
Using you properly is bringing you out and letting you disrespect me and the show.

29:08.000 --> 29:16.000
You're talking like if you went to a rodeo and it's like, get that clown out of there.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
He's just rolling the ball up.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
He's just making it...

29:19.000 --> 29:26.000
I thought the goal was to...

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
I came here to see a ball asleep.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
I came here to see the pacification of a ball.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
The ideal rodeo, I would show up and the ball would be laying there.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Vanquished.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
Who's this guy with the hair running around in barrels?

29:44.000 --> 29:55.000
Yeah, I just thought you're a caustic, destructive, parasitic, symbiotic influence on the show

29:55.000 --> 30:01.000
that the kids enjoy because they like to see me angry.

30:01.000 --> 30:06.000
So, talk about your day.

30:06.000 --> 30:13.000
I got all this GI Jeff stuff here and that's what I got.

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
Oh boy, that GI Jeff stuff.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
What's going on with that?

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
This doesn't work when I do it.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Was that you doing him or?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Yeah, I was trying to...

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Okay.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
That was me doing me doing him.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
All right, well, we know...

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
What was the hotel?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
The Redbury.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
The Redbury.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Welcome to the Redbury.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Oh, you want to do the scene?

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Welcome to the Redbury.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
Let me get that door for you, Mr. Harmon.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Let me get that door for you.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Let me open up that door.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Got any baggage today?

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
All right, well, let me help you out here.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Watch your step.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
There's a puddle.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
All right.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
The Uber driver says the Uber driver...

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Uber driver wants your phone.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
If I could have your phone so the Uber driver could get your...

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
Please, we want to get this vehicle out of the way.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
If you could just give me your phone so the Uber driver can punch...

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
It's a promotional code if you could give me your phone so the Uber driver...

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
Jerome, Jerome, leave Mr. Harmon at peace, please.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
A valued guest here at the Redbury, Jerome.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
I am sorry.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
Jerome, can I talk to you at my office for just one minute?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Okay.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Mr. Harmon, I'm sorry.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Mr. Harmon, please.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
I'm going to have to let you go for a second.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
I've got to go talk to my boss.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
Stay.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Okay.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Please.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Avail yourself of the free coconut...

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Excuse me.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
...cucumber water that we have, Mr. Harmon.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Yes.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Yeah, let me...

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Camelia will check you in.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Yeah, bathe yourself in the coconut water.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Camelia will see to you.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Would you roam in my office at once?

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
Uber driver, please, Uber, please, get...

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
Mr. Uber driver, get into my office as well.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Yes.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
Jerome, Uber driver, come into my office.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Alright, Jerome, Uber driver?

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Yes.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Did you get the phone?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
He wouldn't give me the phone.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
Get the phone!

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
He won't open map!

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
Uber driver, what country are you fucking from?

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Open map, I show you!

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
I know, sir, I know!

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
Alright.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Here's my phone.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Okay.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Okay, here's my phone.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Launch codes initiated.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Oh, shit!

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Ah-ha.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Now send five stars to my offshore account.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
What?

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
What?

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Oh, what?

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
And now call off the airstrike.

32:47.000 --> 32:52.320
Tell me what country you're from who do you work for beeswax none of you

32:54.760 --> 32:56.760
Republic

32:58.280 --> 33:00.280
I hold the cards here

33:00.840 --> 33:07.400
Did you say you're collecting stars and putting them in your offshore to a shore account like

33:07.760 --> 33:14.960
Like it's Switzerland. You've got like all these like five-star reports like in another count these stars are symbolic

33:14.960 --> 33:16.960
They don't there's no currency

33:19.960 --> 33:27.100
We can't get at it we can't get at that rating more stars more business more business more life

33:29.440 --> 33:31.440
Was that are you kissing me

33:36.440 --> 33:37.920
Oh

33:37.920 --> 33:39.920
Leave the office for a moment. All right. I'm good

33:39.920 --> 33:45.600
Turn the lights down on the way out. Okay here. I'm gonna go to the arcade over driver

34:10.160 --> 34:12.800
What what what what what what what what what what?

34:13.960 --> 34:15.960
With just

34:15.960 --> 34:17.960
go the distance

34:17.960 --> 34:19.960
go the distance

34:19.960 --> 34:21.960
shut up

34:21.960 --> 34:23.960
you're a bad boy

34:23.960 --> 34:25.960
you're a bad boy

34:31.960 --> 34:33.960
I

34:35.960 --> 34:37.960
live in

34:37.960 --> 34:39.960
the tunnel

34:40.960 --> 34:42.960
inside Pac-Man

34:42.960 --> 34:44.960
and

34:44.960 --> 34:46.960
don't go into the tunnel, boys

34:46.960 --> 34:48.960
first level

34:48.960 --> 34:50.960
I told you never to go into the tunnel

34:50.960 --> 34:52.960
the tunnel's a metaphor for your subconscious mind

34:56.960 --> 34:58.960
are you gonna keep playing that game?

35:00.960 --> 35:02.960
don't you see all the fucking quarters that are lined up here?

35:04.960 --> 35:06.960
buddy, those are bottle caps

35:06.960 --> 35:08.960
bottle caps

35:12.960 --> 35:14.960
and you're standing in front of a refrigerator

35:18.960 --> 35:20.960
and it's the year 2037

35:24.960 --> 35:26.960
and I'm

35:26.960 --> 35:28.960
a medusa lady

35:28.960 --> 35:30.960
I

35:32.960 --> 35:34.960
do a stretch

35:42.960 --> 35:44.960
Mr. Harmon

35:44.960 --> 35:46.960
sorry for the delay

35:46.960 --> 35:48.960
Camille has you all checked into your room?

35:48.960 --> 35:50.960
yes

35:50.960 --> 35:52.960
I love the cucumber water

35:52.960 --> 35:54.960
wouldn't mind getting the recipe

35:54.960 --> 35:56.960
if you would

35:56.960 --> 35:58.960
hand me your phone

35:58.960 --> 36:00.960
I'd be very happy to give you the recipe

36:00.960 --> 36:02.960
well, everything's worth a risk

36:04.960 --> 36:06.960
Jerome

36:06.960 --> 36:08.960
yes

36:08.960 --> 36:10.960
I'm sorry Mr. Harmon

36:10.960 --> 36:12.960
I have to take Jerome into my office

36:12.960 --> 36:14.960
one more time

36:14.960 --> 36:16.960
one second

36:16.960 --> 36:26.960
yes

36:26.960 --> 36:28.960
I have what you wanted

36:28.960 --> 36:30.960
I have Dan Harmon's phone

36:34.960 --> 36:36.960
I'm going to give you Dan Harmon's phone Jerome

36:36.960 --> 36:38.960
under one condition

36:38.960 --> 36:40.960
that you use it for good and not for evil

36:42.960 --> 36:44.960
I give you the phone

36:44.960 --> 36:46.960
and I

36:46.960 --> 36:48.960
I evaporate into a mist

36:50.960 --> 36:52.960
I was never here

37:10.960 --> 37:12.960
welcome to porn hub prime

37:12.960 --> 37:14.960
MC

37:16.960 --> 37:18.960
it's premium

37:18.960 --> 37:20.960
thanks

37:20.960 --> 37:22.960
alright

37:22.960 --> 37:24.960
the mighty Harmon art players

37:26.960 --> 37:28.960
you never know when they're going to burst into their stage craft

37:30.960 --> 37:32.960
let's take things up a notch

37:32.960 --> 37:34.960
our next guest is a

37:34.960 --> 37:36.960
technical writer

37:36.960 --> 37:38.960
for video game user guides

37:38.960 --> 37:40.960
he's

37:40.960 --> 37:42.960
he's worked at

37:42.960 --> 37:44.960
you can stay Rob

37:44.960 --> 37:46.960
stay here

37:46.960 --> 37:48.960
moving over a chair

37:48.960 --> 37:50.960
that's good

37:50.960 --> 37:52.960
do that

37:52.960 --> 37:54.960
but

37:54.960 --> 37:56.960
you can come out

37:56.960 --> 37:58.960
please welcome Fred

37:58.960 --> 38:08.960
Oliva

38:08.960 --> 38:10.960
alright

38:10.960 --> 38:12.960
hello Fred

38:12.960 --> 38:14.960
alright so I think a lot of us

38:14.960 --> 38:16.960
when we buy video games

38:16.960 --> 38:18.960
the first thing we do is we read

38:18.960 --> 38:20.960
the user manual

38:20.960 --> 38:22.960
no

38:22.960 --> 38:24.960
no exactly

38:24.960 --> 38:26.960
I wasted my entire life

38:26.960 --> 38:28.960
no but you've been doing this since 2005

38:28.960 --> 38:30.960
your first game

38:30.960 --> 38:32.960
that you wrote a technical manual for

38:32.960 --> 38:34.960
was Narnia

38:34.960 --> 38:36.960
yes the chronicles of Narnia

38:36.960 --> 38:38.960
and it was for Disney

38:38.960 --> 38:40.960
the same company for which you work today

38:40.960 --> 38:42.960
that's true

38:42.960 --> 38:44.960
your second game was chicken little

38:44.960 --> 38:46.960
another adaptation

38:46.960 --> 38:48.960
Zach Brab's big hit

38:48.960 --> 38:50.960
but most recently

38:50.960 --> 38:52.960
and you've brought this work with you

38:52.960 --> 38:54.960
you've written a user guide

38:54.960 --> 38:56.960
for Disney's Infinity

38:56.960 --> 38:58.960
and I thought maybe you could

38:58.960 --> 39:00.960
read a couple excerpts

39:00.960 --> 39:02.960
there was

39:02.960 --> 39:04.960
a troubleshooting section

39:04.960 --> 39:06.960
that I thought really captured

39:06.960 --> 39:08.960
wait so when you buy a video game

39:08.960 --> 39:10.960
this will be in the box

39:10.960 --> 39:12.960
that you get and you look through this

39:12.960 --> 39:14.960
okay gotcha and you are the person

39:14.960 --> 39:16.960
that creates, writes all the texts

39:16.960 --> 39:18.960
this is my life's work

39:18.960 --> 39:20.960
this is your work

39:20.960 --> 39:22.960
so everybody just quiet down

39:22.960 --> 39:24.960
can we dim the lights?

39:24.960 --> 39:26.960
yeah

39:26.960 --> 39:28.960
perfect thank you very much

39:32.960 --> 39:34.960
setting up the Disney

39:34.960 --> 39:36.960
Infinity base

39:40.960 --> 39:42.960
once removed

39:42.960 --> 39:44.960
from the packaging

39:44.960 --> 39:46.960
the Disney Infinity base

39:46.960 --> 39:48.960
I wish you'd take this seriously

39:48.960 --> 39:50.960
this is your life's work Fred

39:50.960 --> 39:52.960
pictured below

39:56.960 --> 39:58.960
needs to be placed on a stable

39:58.960 --> 40:00.960
secure and even surface

40:00.960 --> 40:02.960
a table

40:06.960 --> 40:08.960
could have just said table

40:08.960 --> 40:10.960
near the console

40:10.960 --> 40:12.960
do not place a Disney Infinity base

40:14.960 --> 40:16.960
on the console

40:16.960 --> 40:18.960
or

40:18.960 --> 40:20.960
on metal surfaces

40:22.960 --> 40:24.960
or have metallic

40:24.960 --> 40:26.960
objects nearby

40:26.960 --> 40:28.960
what about a giant magnet

40:32.960 --> 40:34.960
can I put it in a microwave

40:38.960 --> 40:40.960
nah that wouldn't work either

40:40.960 --> 40:42.960
there's a few pages of that but then it goes on

40:42.960 --> 40:44.960
and it's in all the different languages from around the world

40:44.960 --> 40:46.960
but you don't have to do that

40:46.960 --> 40:48.960
you just hand that off and then someone else translates

40:48.960 --> 40:50.960
I'm actually fluent in Portuguese

40:50.960 --> 40:52.960
do you want to do the Portuguese version?

40:54.960 --> 40:56.960
I think I over-set my batteries on that

40:56.960 --> 40:58.960
how about this Rob

40:58.960 --> 41:00.960
you have just purchased

41:00.960 --> 41:02.960
Disney's Infinity and you have some

41:02.960 --> 41:04.960
trouble that you need to have shot

41:06.960 --> 41:08.960
but you've made a huge

41:08.960 --> 41:10.960
error and you've called up a guy who

41:10.960 --> 41:14.960
only troubleshoots in Portuguese

41:18.960 --> 41:20.960
and you are being portrayed

41:20.960 --> 41:22.960
by Billy Zane

41:30.960 --> 41:32.960
sorry Fred I didn't know

41:32.960 --> 41:34.960
that you would be required to do improv

41:34.960 --> 41:36.960
I'm happy to be next to Billy Zane

41:36.960 --> 41:38.960
okay

41:38.960 --> 41:40.960
I don't have my hair shaved close enough

41:40.960 --> 41:42.960
to do this

41:42.960 --> 41:44.960
I would love to hear the

41:44.960 --> 41:46.960
troubleshooting that you just read

41:46.960 --> 41:48.960
in the Portuguese language

41:48.960 --> 41:50.960
I was actually snapchatting my big toe

41:50.960 --> 41:52.960
to Uber

41:52.960 --> 41:54.960
sorry about that

41:54.960 --> 41:56.960
so yes

42:00.960 --> 42:02.960
sorry I was lost

42:02.960 --> 42:04.960
I just found where I am

42:04.960 --> 42:06.960
okay

42:10.960 --> 42:12.960
that's in French

42:12.960 --> 42:14.960
that was in Portuguese

42:14.960 --> 42:16.960
I am a little bit

42:16.960 --> 42:18.960
that wasn't the troubleshooting guide

42:18.960 --> 42:20.960
alright well let's talk about your craft

42:24.960 --> 42:26.960
so obviously

42:26.960 --> 42:28.960
you get a video game

42:28.960 --> 42:30.960
and then you play it

42:30.960 --> 42:32.960
now when you get it I'm assuming

42:32.960 --> 42:34.960
the people that made the game

42:34.960 --> 42:36.960
they must have scribbles of how the game works

42:36.960 --> 42:38.960
right the dev team and actually QA

42:38.960 --> 42:40.960
and all the people that worked on the game

42:40.960 --> 42:42.960
quality assurance

42:42.960 --> 42:44.960
nice

42:48.960 --> 42:50.960
so basically what you want to do

42:50.960 --> 42:52.960
is you're kind of like the conduit

42:52.960 --> 42:54.960
between the dev team

42:54.960 --> 42:56.960
and QA

42:56.960 --> 42:58.960
make sure you eat that mic

42:58.960 --> 43:00.960
you're kind of like the conduit between

43:00.960 --> 43:02.960
you know

43:02.960 --> 43:04.960
between the dev team

43:04.960 --> 43:06.960
and QA

43:06.960 --> 43:08.960
and the user

43:08.960 --> 43:10.960
so is there somebody at QA

43:10.960 --> 43:12.960
saying how do you play the game

43:12.960 --> 43:14.960
ask them

43:14.960 --> 43:16.960
they're kind of relying on you

43:16.960 --> 43:18.960
so then you talk to the dev team and the dev team goes like

43:18.960 --> 43:20.960
X is crouch and Y is jump

43:20.960 --> 43:22.960
and then you go X is crouch

43:22.960 --> 43:24.960
and Y is jump and you type that up

43:24.960 --> 43:26.960
and then the QA person goes like

43:26.960 --> 43:28.960
that's not clear enough what does that mean

43:28.960 --> 43:30.960
is that the process

43:30.960 --> 43:32.960
because what happens is

43:32.960 --> 43:34.960
what happens is especially if you have

43:34.960 --> 43:36.960
depending on the demographic that you're dealing with

43:36.960 --> 43:38.960
it's like

43:38.960 --> 43:40.960
maybe they might not be

43:40.960 --> 43:42.960
very well versed in games

43:42.960 --> 43:44.960
so what you have to do is kind of like show them

43:44.960 --> 43:46.960
you know this is

43:46.960 --> 43:48.960
how do you get out of

43:48.960 --> 43:50.960
out of Hannah Montana's tour bus

43:50.960 --> 43:52.960
shout out to Hannah Montana

43:52.960 --> 43:54.960
the movie video game

43:54.960 --> 43:56.960
I heard it out there

43:56.960 --> 43:58.960
you're saying that particular consumer

43:58.960 --> 44:00.960
we should probably cast a wider net

44:00.960 --> 44:02.960
in terms of explanation

44:02.960 --> 44:04.960
right right right exactly

44:04.960 --> 44:06.960
you write that to make

44:06.960 --> 44:08.960
that crowd

44:08.960 --> 44:10.960
Rob what are you doing

44:10.960 --> 44:12.960
he's going to lessons

44:12.960 --> 44:14.960
stay here

44:14.960 --> 44:16.960
I think my phone might be charged

44:18.960 --> 44:20.960
what's that

44:20.960 --> 44:22.960
you're on a show

44:22.960 --> 44:24.960
are you going to make phone calls

44:24.960 --> 44:26.960
I don't want to forget it

44:26.960 --> 44:28.960
it's in the charger right now

44:28.960 --> 44:30.960
and I wanted to

44:30.960 --> 44:32.960
sit sit

44:32.960 --> 44:34.960
do you want me to get you your phone

44:34.960 --> 44:36.960
I'm close

44:36.960 --> 44:38.960
here's your phone

44:38.960 --> 44:40.960
it's got a Legos on it

44:40.960 --> 44:42.960
adorable

44:42.960 --> 44:44.960
let's try to escape

44:44.960 --> 44:46.960
the episode

44:46.960 --> 44:48.960
alright anyways

44:48.960 --> 44:50.960
I was just going to sneak off

44:50.960 --> 44:52.960
do a quick sneak off

44:52.960 --> 44:54.960
just

44:54.960 --> 44:56.960
I don't want to forget it

44:56.960 --> 44:58.960
he was trying to leave

44:58.960 --> 45:00.960
no I wasn't trying to leave

45:00.960 --> 45:02.960
my phone was there

45:02.960 --> 45:04.960
I wasn't making up that

45:04.960 --> 45:06.960
I can hear you

45:06.960 --> 45:08.960
I wasn't making up an excuse

45:08.960 --> 45:10.960
I just felt like

45:10.960 --> 45:12.960
I was trying not to still focus

45:14.960 --> 45:16.960
by standing up

45:16.960 --> 45:22.960
and creeping off the stage

45:22.960 --> 45:24.960
what is the

45:24.960 --> 45:26.960
what's the hardest video game

45:26.960 --> 45:28.960
you've ever had to write a manual for

45:30.960 --> 45:32.960
that definitely has to be

45:34.960 --> 45:36.960
Lizzie McGuire on the go

45:38.960 --> 45:40.960
that was the hardest one you ever had to do

45:40.960 --> 45:42.960
what was the biggest challenge

45:42.960 --> 45:44.960
of Lizzie McGuire

45:44.960 --> 45:46.960
for the user

45:46.960 --> 45:48.960
how many lockers you can open in that school

45:48.960 --> 45:50.960
and show people how to do that

45:50.960 --> 45:52.960
that was

45:52.960 --> 45:54.960
what's the answer

45:54.960 --> 45:56.960
the answer is

45:58.960 --> 46:00.960
I don't know what the answer is

46:00.960 --> 46:02.960
the answer was six but anyways

46:02.960 --> 46:04.960
that's a lot of lockers

46:04.960 --> 46:06.960
that's a lot of lockers

46:06.960 --> 46:08.960
what's the gameplay of Lizzie McGuire

46:08.960 --> 46:10.960
I don't even know what that means

46:10.960 --> 46:12.960
it's a girl runs around and she just goes through people's shit

46:12.960 --> 46:14.960
that's

46:14.960 --> 46:16.960
I shit you not

46:16.960 --> 46:18.960
that's exactly what it is

46:18.960 --> 46:20.960
I remember a poster for a movie

46:20.960 --> 46:22.960
about her

46:26.960 --> 46:28.960
and she was kind of leaping in the air

46:28.960 --> 46:30.960
and

46:30.960 --> 46:32.960
she had a pair of keds on

46:32.960 --> 46:34.960
and

46:34.960 --> 46:36.960
I think maybe she was going to Europe

46:36.960 --> 46:38.960
she seemed very happy about it

46:38.960 --> 46:40.960
her arms were outstretched

46:40.960 --> 46:42.960
how was it revealed that she was going to Europe

46:42.960 --> 46:44.960
in the poster

46:44.960 --> 46:46.960
Big Ben was in the background

46:46.960 --> 46:48.960
and the title was Lizzie McGuire

46:48.960 --> 46:50.960
sounds like she's running away from Europe

46:50.960 --> 46:52.960
if it's in the background

46:52.960 --> 46:54.960
I mean if her arms are outstretched

46:54.960 --> 46:56.960
and Big Ben's behind her

46:56.960 --> 46:58.960
she's trying to escape

46:58.960 --> 47:00.960
get me out of Europe

47:00.960 --> 47:02.960
or at least out of England

47:02.960 --> 47:04.960
anyways

47:04.960 --> 47:06.960
seemed like a good role model for kids

47:06.960 --> 47:08.960
I took an interest

47:08.960 --> 47:10.960
while I was driving by

47:10.960 --> 47:12.960
she looks like a good kid

47:16.960 --> 47:18.960
Kim Possible also

47:18.960 --> 47:20.960
wow Kim Possible

47:20.960 --> 47:22.960
seems like a good kid

47:22.960 --> 47:24.960
wow I worked on Kim Possible too

47:24.960 --> 47:26.960
remember that

47:26.960 --> 47:28.960
e-surance commercial girl

47:28.960 --> 47:30.960
with the pink hair

47:30.960 --> 47:32.960
remember them

47:32.960 --> 47:34.960
you know why they stopped

47:34.960 --> 47:36.960
on the Facebook this weekend

47:36.960 --> 47:38.960
in between

47:38.960 --> 47:40.960
renders

47:40.960 --> 47:42.960
they stopped doing those

47:42.960 --> 47:44.960
commercials because people kept doing

47:44.960 --> 47:46.960
fake porn of her

47:46.960 --> 47:48.960
because she was just too sexy

47:48.960 --> 47:50.960
right

47:50.960 --> 47:52.960
so the person

47:52.960 --> 47:54.960
who makes money if people are

47:54.960 --> 47:56.960
interested in that image said

47:56.960 --> 47:58.960
oh that's enough

47:58.960 --> 48:00.960
who stepped in

48:00.960 --> 48:02.960
that doesn't

48:02.960 --> 48:04.960
make any sense

48:04.960 --> 48:06.960
did someone write to e-surance

48:06.960 --> 48:08.960
and say yeah

48:08.960 --> 48:10.960
I just googled

48:10.960 --> 48:12.960
e-surance girl rule 34

48:12.960 --> 48:14.960
porn

48:14.960 --> 48:16.960
and I found too many hits

48:16.960 --> 48:18.960
so I'm not going to use your insurance

48:18.960 --> 48:20.960
unless you use a different spokesmodel

48:20.960 --> 48:22.960
that's exactly what happened

48:22.960 --> 48:24.960
okay

48:24.960 --> 48:26.960
seems to me

48:26.960 --> 48:28.960
that they

48:28.960 --> 48:30.960
would be excited

48:30.960 --> 48:32.960
some people were

48:32.960 --> 48:34.960
do you ever

48:34.960 --> 48:36.960
have you ever

48:36.960 --> 48:38.960
Fred have you ever

48:38.960 --> 48:40.960
successfully

48:40.960 --> 48:42.960
reached completion

48:42.960 --> 48:44.960
watching rule 34 porn

48:44.960 --> 48:46.960
what's rule 34

48:46.960 --> 48:48.960
that's like animated

48:48.960 --> 48:50.960
it's usually animated porn

48:50.960 --> 48:52.960
rule 34 is

48:52.960 --> 48:54.960
the mythical internet

48:54.960 --> 48:56.960
rule that if it's

48:56.960 --> 48:58.960
what is it if you can conceive of it

48:58.960 --> 49:00.960
or what's the

49:00.960 --> 49:02.960
if it exists there's porn of it

49:02.960 --> 49:04.960
so Ronald McDonald there's porn of it

49:04.960 --> 49:06.960
why 34

49:06.960 --> 49:08.960
because it sounds like a random number

49:08.960 --> 49:10.960
okay

49:10.960 --> 49:12.960
I'm going to say yes

49:14.960 --> 49:16.960
I got confused about rule 34

49:16.960 --> 49:18.960
what was your question to him Dan

49:18.960 --> 49:20.960
did he ever finish

49:20.960 --> 49:22.960
while watching any of it

49:22.960 --> 49:24.960
in a world where there's nothing but porn available

49:24.960 --> 49:26.960
it's like I did

49:26.960 --> 49:28.960
I did it once too

49:28.960 --> 49:30.960
Velma and Shaggy

49:30.960 --> 49:32.960
saying

49:32.960 --> 49:34.960
there was porn of Velma and Shaggy

49:34.960 --> 49:36.960
no there's porn of Fred and Daphne

49:44.960 --> 49:46.960
give me a break

49:46.960 --> 49:48.960
because everybody wanted to be with ginger

49:48.960 --> 49:50.960
on Gilligan's Island right not Marianne

49:50.960 --> 49:52.960
of course there's porn of Velma

49:52.960 --> 49:54.960
Shaggy

49:54.960 --> 49:56.960
did you stumble across this or were you

49:56.960 --> 49:58.960
no I fucking typed it in

50:00.960 --> 50:02.960
you better believe it

50:02.960 --> 50:04.960
and I was proud of myself because I found

50:04.960 --> 50:06.960
how good was the quality

50:06.960 --> 50:08.960
did it look like Scooby Doo

50:08.960 --> 50:10.960
it wasn't so good

50:10.960 --> 50:12.960
that it wasn't interesting to me

50:12.960 --> 50:14.960
that I

50:14.960 --> 50:16.960
met it halfway you know what I mean

50:16.960 --> 50:18.960
it was bad enough that I was like

50:18.960 --> 50:20.960
something's going on here with me

50:20.960 --> 50:22.960
right now

50:22.960 --> 50:24.960
like it wasn't high quality and I was like

50:24.960 --> 50:26.960
still I was like I want this

50:26.960 --> 50:28.960
was it just like Gonzo

50:28.960 --> 50:30.960
Shaggy and

50:30.960 --> 50:32.960
there's a lot of like cartoon porn where it's like

50:32.960 --> 50:34.960
some enterprising youth

50:34.960 --> 50:36.960
will just use his like

50:36.960 --> 50:38.960
Toon Boom skills

50:38.960 --> 50:40.960
or his whatever too

50:40.960 --> 50:42.960
he'll just take existing cartoons

50:42.960 --> 50:44.960
and then he'll kind of like

50:44.960 --> 50:46.960
mask out heads

50:46.960 --> 50:48.960
and then put a dick in the mouth instead

50:48.960 --> 50:50.960
was there storytelling to it

50:50.960 --> 50:52.960
a little tiny bit

50:52.960 --> 50:54.960
like it'll usually be

50:54.960 --> 50:56.960
the beginning of a cartoon where it's like

50:56.960 --> 50:58.960
Shaggy

50:58.960 --> 51:00.960
you said we were going to

51:00.960 --> 51:02.960
watch a movie

51:02.960 --> 51:04.960
well Zoinks I thought

51:04.960 --> 51:06.960
we'd solve a mystery instead

51:06.960 --> 51:08.960
and then all of a sudden it's just like

51:08.960 --> 51:12.960
boar boar boar boar boar boar

51:12.960 --> 51:14.960
boar boar boar

51:14.960 --> 51:16.960
Jinkies

51:16.960 --> 51:18.960
boar boar

51:18.960 --> 51:20.960
Zoinks

51:20.960 --> 51:22.960
boar boar

51:22.960 --> 51:24.960
Zoinks

51:24.960 --> 51:26.960
it's like the same zoinks in the same

51:26.960 --> 51:28.960
Jinkies but

51:28.960 --> 51:30.960
it got me where I was going

51:30.960 --> 51:32.960
where were you going

51:32.960 --> 51:34.960
after a lifetime of like

51:34.960 --> 51:36.960
I didn't know I didn't know I wanted it

51:36.960 --> 51:40.720
Okay, I'm a sucker for a Velma for sure. Yeah

51:45.000 --> 51:50.720
I met a girl in the somewhere like one of those were you going Rob Rob sit down

51:54.120 --> 51:57.360
Yeah, I met a girl that looks so much like Velma once that it was it was pretty hot

51:57.360 --> 52:03.880
She was she really was a Velma and her friend looked just like Daphne and they weren't doing that on purpose. I

52:03.880 --> 52:07.080
Think it's the turtleneck most of all

52:09.920 --> 52:18.720
What what makes it sexy that shaggy was the one oh nothing. I just because you don't relate to Fred, right?

52:25.640 --> 52:31.640
Yeah, he's dirty like she's supposed to she's yeah, yeah, he's yeah, he likes sandwiches. I was always worried about I

52:31.640 --> 52:33.380
I

52:33.380 --> 52:39.040
Love the big sandwich. I was always bummed out like sandwiches in the wind in the news today

52:40.360 --> 52:46.240
They make these stoner like four foot tall sandwiches and they put the toothpick with the olive on top

52:46.240 --> 52:49.920
And they would eat the whole thing. I was always so bummed out about the toothpick being in there

52:49.920 --> 52:53.560
So you're gonna kill yourself you fucking eat a toothpick

52:54.400 --> 52:56.680
So you just you can't feed a chicken bone to a dog

52:56.680 --> 53:01.400
So you're gonna give Scooby a fucking toothpick. Yeah, you can't do that. You can't you shouldn't do it?

53:02.240 --> 53:05.700
It was distracting to me at my night. I'm a I love a sandwich

53:06.560 --> 53:13.960
Fred I wouldn't jerk off to I don't you think do you think there's slash porn rule 34 a Scooby fucking Velma?

53:13.960 --> 53:18.360
Yes, there's gotta be no definitely drawings of it. There is for sure. Yeah, right

53:19.000 --> 53:23.880
But the yeah the card to the actual animation. It's you know the more work required

53:23.880 --> 53:30.040
I think that's the point of porn is like like so there's a there's a laziness to everything like like that's that's

53:30.120 --> 53:35.720
That's why you know the old cinematic porn is a lost art. It's found porn. Yeah

53:36.120 --> 53:38.380
Yeah, it's really going down here

53:42.280 --> 53:43.880
Man

53:43.880 --> 53:48.520
Man this this this new porn is really getting me down

53:48.520 --> 53:52.640
Now it's cinematic as it used to be

53:56.120 --> 53:58.120
Shit

53:58.400 --> 54:01.200

May I speak to you in the corner booth?

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:45.680
But by all means miles taken off my shirt you'll have to confuse the Red very as of late

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:55.960
it's gone downhill. I still believe in it, for privacy's sake. Have a seat. Mr. Aleeva

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.400
will be to the point where both busy men and the-

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.400
We are.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:10.600
Get those dollars out, gentlemen. Never thought I'd say it.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:17.600
Peril to the stage. She's got to get off that shit.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:24.600
I'm going to put a lit candle up my ass. It's Mondays at the Redberry.

Every Mondays. For the next 45 minutes, Lemon Drops are half off.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:42.360
Mr. Aleeva, you are one of the best technical manual writers in video game history.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.800
Thank you, thank you. High praise, high praise indeed.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:51.960
I run a city. I don't know video games. I don't know technical writing.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:02:03.120
I know craftsmanship and I know fascism. The latter is, I've got it handled.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:11.800
The former sir, I have not seen the like of since looking into your eyes at the G4 summit.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.680
When you press that business card into my hand, now I've been crunching the numbers

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:24.240
and I've been seeing the lights and I've got a proposition for you.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:29.040
What if the whole city were a video game?

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:36.040
Like SimCity. If it's been done, then fuck it.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:46.040
Pardon, Mr. Aleeva, Mr. Mayor. I asked for privacy over here.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:51.440
Please don't leave. I have no way home.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:55.600
Carol and I would like to take Mr. Mayor and Mr. Aleeva up.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:00.120
We'd like to take you upstairs for a moment. We have something rather important to discuss.

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.440
No problem, no problem.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.000
Mr. Aleeva, Mr. Aleeva, what if what I proposed you is actually happening right now?

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.800
What if this is all a simulation? Go.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:21.280
F217, F217, your directors were not to kill the mayor.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.480
My orders were to accommodate him. He needed accoutrements.

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:35.280
My accoutrements include a bullet fired out of a gun.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.480
I reveal twists with every active.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.920
F217, F217, I'm going to give you the week off.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:48.480
I want you to go home and you're suspended from the RedBerry for a while.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:53.280
Carol, Carol, go get some rags. We have to clean up the mayor's corpse.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:58.080
I need a ride home. He goes right by where I live.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.960
If you're sending him home, I mean, I could really use...

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.600
Okay, Carol, yeah, you take Mr. Aleeva home?

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.280
No, the robot, he's driving by my...

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.600
F217?

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.360
The only robot I'm pointing at.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:16.480
F217, get Carol the fuck out of here.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:19.640
Okay, I called you both an Uber.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.160
I live in a very peaceful neighborhood.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:27.040
It is peaceful because there is zero crime.

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:31.400
It has zero crime because we have redefined crime.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:35.960
Once per year, we eliminate rape and murder from our systems

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:39.440
by engaging in it wholesale.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.960
We enjoy it so much, we are peaceful.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.720
I am F127.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:58.640
Yeah, the crazy thing about that improv is that shit could happen.

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.560
Yeah, it might still be happening.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:07.040
Fred, it's still happening. This is all a simulation.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.280
I'll write about it.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:13.040
But you'll be being written about while you do it.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:18.920
What you'll be writing is press X to control Fred.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:22.960
And then you'll look over your shoulder and there will be a giant Fred going...

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:28.640
Or a Carol.

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:34.680
This is all in your manual, Fred.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.640
Well, man, is there anything you'd like to plug?

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:41.520
Do you have a big trade paper back of video game instructions?

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.520
I'd like to plug my band Super Bean.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.520
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're in a band.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.520
Super Bean, yeah, I play a band.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.520
Super Bean?

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.520
Super Bean.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.520
Bean.

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.520
There's human beans and there's Super Bean.

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.520
Oh, there's a bean, like a bean.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.520
Yeah, that's correct.

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.520
Write it down.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.520
Write it down.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.520
Write it down.

01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.520
There's a bean, there's a human bean.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.520
Where are you guys playing next?

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.520
We're playing Cafe Neela.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.520
Hopefully, Marks.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.520
Hopefully.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.520
Okay, Mark.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.520
What are you opening with?

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.520
What do...

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:09.520
Oh, you mean...

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.520
Are you...

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.520
Opening song?

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.520
It's a Super Bean theme.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.520
Oh.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.520
Let's hear it for Super Bean.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.520
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.520
What's your...

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:17.520
What are you closing with?

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.520
What is your closing song?

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.520
Do you guys do any covers?

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.520
Do you guys do any covers?

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.520
The Super Bean reprise.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.520
For real?

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.520
You guys don't know any Fog Hat?

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:24.520
Wow.

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520
I love Fog Hat.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:35.520
All right, well, let's all graciously thank Fred for opening his life to us.

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.520
Thank you.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.520
That's what it's like to be a technical writer.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.520
Hopefully, there's a seat among your friends out there.

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.520
I hope you don't have to go back and sit in the belfry.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.520
All right.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.520
Let's go.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520
Let's go.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.520
Let's go.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.520
Let's go.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.520
Let's go.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.520
Let's go.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.520
Let's go.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.520
Let's go.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.520
Let's go.

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:57.520
I hope you don't have to go back and sit in the belfry.

01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:01.520
Fred, that music means leave.

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:04.960
I was just wondering.

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:14.860
I suppose there's probably another seat for him among his friends.

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.920
The word leave is in his name.

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:24.920
He had a bunch of friends who came, I was wondering if there was a seat among them for him, but there probably isn't.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:28.920
So now I feel bad for our guests because then they have to go and sit in the closet for the rest of the show.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.920
When they have friends that come.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.920
He had a big posse in the grandstand, there was a whole team of people.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:34.920
And they're all watching the show.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:39.920
And now they're friends offstage, and they're friends in a closet, and he can't sit in the show.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.920
I think about these things.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:42.920
Should we have them sit over there?

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:43.920
Oh yeah, he could sit at Spencer's.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.920
Fred, Oliva, get back out here.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.920
Fred?

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.920
That's perfect.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:47.920
Fred, you're brilliant.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:48.920
Where are you?

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.920
Fred, go sit by Spencer's seat.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.920
Yeah, you can sit there.

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:51.920
And now you have a seat in the show.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.920
I'll do something to help me.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.920
No, yeah.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.920
He's sick.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.920
That's perfect.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:07:59.920
I don't have a 20-sided type.

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.920
He might actually make a good game master because he writes explanations.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:03.920
He's the master of games.

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:04.920
He's literally a master of games.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:05.920
Yeah.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:11.920
Fred, do you ever play any role-playing games, like pen and paper kind of stuff?

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.920
Yes, I don't talk about that in public.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:19.920
Wow, you're a real rich tapestry man.

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:28.920
Rob, we're in the room.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.920
What are you doing?

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.920
He's scrolling through something.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.920
It looks like he's just picking a date.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.920
He doesn't even look like he's doing anything.

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.920
Instagram or Facebook?

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:43.920
Yeah, I told somebody I would give him a shout out and I'm trying to, I want to make sure

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:44.920
that I give him a shout out.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.920
All right, shout out to the most memorable person in the world.

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:48.920
Oh, don't do that.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.920
You're very important.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.920
I can't say it now.

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.920
It's serious, so.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:59.920
Oh, are you seeing somebody?

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:00.920
Yes.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.920
Are you seeing me?

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:12.920
Remember a couple weeks ago, you made me feel real bad for missing your birthday?

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:19.920
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.920
Jeff, did you go to my birthday?

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:22.920
I was out of town.

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.920
He was out of town.

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:29.920
He texted me, happy birthday though.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.920
I bought him a bath rubs.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.920
You're leaving for Vancouver?

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:39.920
What?

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:45.920
Beginning of 2017.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.920
That long?

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:47.920
That long?

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.920
Yeah, that's a long way away.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.920
Yeah, that's a long way away.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.920
You'll have another birthday between now and when you leave.

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.920
Yeah.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:00.920
So we'll make it the best one ever.

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.920
All right.

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.920
Moving on, we've got a lot of show to cover.

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:13.920
Our next guest is very handsome and a debonair.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.920
He always gets all dressed up.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.920
He's gotten an extra sexy haircut lately.

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.920
And he's always here.

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:25.920
We're very comforted by his face and his voice.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.920
And we wish him the best of luck.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.920
He has some terrible news for us tonight.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.920
No, he doesn't, I'm kidding.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:33.920
DeMorge Brown.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.920
DeMorge Brown.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.920
Yeah.

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.920
Yeah.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:40.920
Ain't shit some rich man, son.

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:45.920
He got nothing when Sunday.

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.920
Don't talk to him.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:50.920
Don't want none, but he don't.

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:51.920
What's up, DeMorge?

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:52.920
Not much.

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.920
Can I talk to you about physical fitness for a little bit?

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:56.920
All you want.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:57.920
Have you been working out?

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.920
Yes, so I always do, though.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:01.920
But were you ever fat?

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:05.920
Oh, no.

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:06.920
I was uncoordinated.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.920
Yeah, I was like...

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.920
If you lifted up your shirt right now, would there be like a Peter Parker kind of like,

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:13.920
like six pack?

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:14.920
No, absolutely not.

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:15.920
I've done this this year.

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.920
Just a flat, it would just be a flat, delicious.

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.920
Have you ever had abs, like six pack abs?

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:21.920
Yeah, most of the time.

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.920
Most of the time?

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:23.920
For real?

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:29.920
But I played soccer like it's a kid, and if you, by the luck of the draw, because my

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:33.920
brain wasn't like those kids that are just naturally athletic, but I just love playing

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.920
and stuff.

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:39.920
So you ascend pretty high, and at a certain level, you're getting basically pro trainers.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:40.920
You're 11.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.920
The guys that are training you are professional.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.920
So you're getting like that kind of mental conditioning that gets you, you know, they

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.920
basically take the stuff that most people kind of look at running and go, I don't want

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.920
to do that shit.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.920
So can you give Dan some pointers, because Dan was saying the other day that you had a

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.920
pointer is exercise and get a trainer and stuff.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.920
But it's also about like life, like mentally, how you do it.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.920
They tricked us one time.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.920
There was a level where they said everybody there at this camp wanted to be, wanted to

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.920
stay on this team.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:11.920
But the main requirement was that when they timed your runs, you had to come in under a

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.920
certain number of minutes on this one run.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.920
It was be the longest run that you've done at this pace ever.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.920
And so for the first two weeks, they just let you stew with this fear that you were going

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.920
to, you know, not make the grade and have to go home instead of spend the entire summer

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:26.920
running around traveling places and having fun.

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:32.920
And we did a run right before it where nobody felt good and everybody was dogging and everybody

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:33.920
was just, you know, dying.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.920
I was looking at people as we were running and going, what the fuck is wrong with me?

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.920
Because we just felt horrible.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:44.920
And at the end of the run, the guy was like, you guys think that that was a pretty bad

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:45.920
run.

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:48.920
Services were, everything was, all the conditions were optimal.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.920
You should have run better.

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.920
But what you guys don't know is that you ran not the four required time miles, but you

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:55.920
ran eight.

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:56.920
We just didn't tell you what you were doing.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.920
And so, and it's just like, but it was just physical fitness.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:00.920
It's dishonest.

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:02.920
That's like the aerobics ladies.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.920
They always go and 10, nine, eight and 11 and seven.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.920
That's Rosie O'Donnell.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:11.920
It was like that guy in the gym too was looking at his friend when they're lifting weights

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.920
and he's going, come on, do one more, one more, one more.

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:15.920
But it's the same as a director.

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.920
I do like that relationship.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:21.920
I talk to a lot of guys who like, they have personal trainers and then they have like these

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.920
kind of like, you know, they're pretty important relationships.

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:31.920
I talk, I have, I have one friend who's gay and who, I swear to God, and he has a personal

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:37.920
trainer and like, and like the guy is straight and like the trainer straight and like, but

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:41.920
he's like hot and he's always like, you know, when you're a trainer, you're like, you're

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:47.920
servicing like all, you're hitting all these buttons emotionally, you know, you're like,

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:51.920
you're like saying to this guy, everything that a guy would want to hear if he would,

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:54.920
if he wanted to be romantically involved with a guy, you're saying, you're like the wind

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:58.920
beneath that guy's wings, you're going like, you're the best, you're the fucking best,

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:03.920
you know, and it's, it's really weird because, and it's like, because there's a whole, it's

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:10.920
LA and so a lot of these trainers are straight and they're actors and they want to work in

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.920
the industry and then they're like training.

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.920
Plush comes to shove.

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:21.920
Like a lot of like a very powerful gay men getting physically trained by guys that they

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:25.920
know are straight and it's like, it's very interesting to just hear about these things.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:31.920
I have a trainer I go to very infrequently and he's really, really funny.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.920
He's a black guy and he calls me the N word constantly.

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:40.920
That would go, I would pay a million dollars for that. Okay, if that, if that can be a part of

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.920
exercise, I didn't know that.

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:45.920
And then are you fucking kidding me?

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:48.920
He's like, he keeps calling everybody the N word.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.920
He calls me the N word the most.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.920
And then, and probably makes you the happiest the other day.

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.920
Wait, this guy's your trainer?

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:57.920
He's great.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:58.920
Wait, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:14:59.920
Oh, you got to do it.

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:04.920
Is he going to just say that over and put lifting as a, come on, and he calls me that?

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.920
He also recommends that you come to work out a little high.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.920
He wants you to smoke a little bit of weed before you.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.920
And a little late because he wants all the stereotypes.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:14.920
He's like, he wants to like, like, like lean into him.

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.920
Okay, so now you're going too far.

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:17.920
All right, all right.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.920
But when it's leg day, I have a little skinny, little skinny chicken legs.

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.920
And so we do legs and I can't walk.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.920
We do a dance called the wonky honky.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:30.920
And we, we do the wonky honky leg.

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:35.920
Well, see, I don't want the, the whole like, oh, come on, white boy, you're pretty good

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.920
for a white boy.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920
I want, I want to be called.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.920
He calls you, he calls you nigger the whole time.

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.920
Don't, you don't have to say it.

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:42.920
It's hilarious.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:43.920
It was with an A, right?

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:50.920
But I want to be, I was like, I want to like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like DMX.

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:52.920
I want DMX to yell at me.

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:53.920
Yeah.

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.920
Do it number one, do it number two, do it number three, get it.

01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.920
No, it'd be amazing.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.920
Because I wouldn't, it wouldn't feel fraudulent.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.920
It would feel like empowerment to me.

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:04.920
I know.

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.920
Because he'd be like, fuck, you hear it, fucking do it.

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.920
As much as we're laughing because he's so, we've, we've, I've known this guy forever.

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:10.920
We're good friends.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:11.920
He's fucking hilarious.

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:15.920
Also, like, you will want to barf in the middle of it because it's like really hard going.

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:18.920
But like, he keeps it fun and buoyant and it's always different.

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:19.920
It's very good stuff.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.920
Oh man.

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.920
I mean, I'm picturing, I'm picturing him as DMX.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.920
I don't know.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.920
It says it's like, it's just the idea of the, like, the validation that you would be, like,

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.920
like, like, like, he would, he would be like, come on, fuck him.

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:32.920
Yeah.

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.920
Yeah.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:34.920
Yeah.

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:38.920
One of the, one of the, we're at a new gym now because like, it's like he moved to a different

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:39.920
gym.

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:40.920
So I was the first time I went there.

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:43.920
There's this other trainer who looks like, like Cypress Hill.

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:46.920
Like he's like an Irish guy with a big, you know, like red beard.

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:50.920
And he walks up and he, he walks into the field and he goes, Phil, stop looking at the white

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.920
women.

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:52.920
This is a joke.

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:55.920
And he goes, he goes, oh man, you guys are all races.

01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:59.920
You've been calling everybody the N-word the entire time.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:03.920
It's, it's, everybody is just hurling fake racism at each other the whole time.

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:04.920
It's really good.

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:05.920
I just want the N-word.

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:06.920
I don't want any of this.

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.920
I don't want any of this stuff.

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.920
I don't want to be a party to anything.

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:13.920
I want to be called that word sincerely.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:14.920
Like, like, like, like.

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:15.920
Oh, he's your man.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:16.920
He's your man.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:20.920
It's like, like, remember Rob, like, remember when we were kids in Milwaukee?

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.920
Rob, Rob's, but Rob's been bald since the seventies.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:26.920
Nineteen.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:27.920
Nineteen.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.920
And, and, and before Bruce Willis was in Pulp Fiction, it was like not, it was, you know,

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.920
and before Patrick Stewart was the captain of the enterprise.

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:40.920
It's like, like, you know, and when Rob was 22, it was like, you know, there wasn't a lot

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:45.920
of pride involved in Milwaukee with, with the losing of the hair.

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:49.920
I was, I was, I was friends with him when he was going through like a weird phase where

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.920
it was like, it was hitting critical mass.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:56.920
And he was like, he had a, he had a girlfriend who like kind of made it clear that, you know,

01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:59.920
wouldn't be maybe a bad idea for him to go get a toupee.

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.920
And like, he, he went, he went through the whole motion of that.

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.920
Like, like, like, you know, and, and, but, but, and he can, he can talk about that in

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:09.920
a second.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.920
But the, but the, but the thing that I remember you being so excited about, because there was

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:17.920
that day, I think it was like, like when Pulp Fiction was like, he came out.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:21.920
He was like, all of a sudden, like balding men in cinema just started like,

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:22.920
It's fucking hot.

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:23.920
Instead of like,

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:24.920
So hot.

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.920
It went from Hudson Hawk, where it was like CG hair.

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:31.920
And then it was like Pulp Fiction, where if you, even if you had the fucking like, like,

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.920
like, like receding hair, you just fucking shave it off.

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:35.920
Like, why not?

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:36.920
It's more virile than that.

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.920
And so all of a sudden, and then like, Rob got all excited and like came in, I can't

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:44.920
remember where we were, but you were like, I was driving down far well.

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:50.920
And, and, and, and it was, I was at a stoplight and this, and this big like, like, like, like,

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:54.920
scary looking black guy, like, like muscles and like, like, like it was fucking, he looked

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:58.920
like, like, like, like not a guy that would like hang out with me.

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.920
And he's like yelling something at the car.

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:02.920
And I'm like, Oh God, now what?

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:06.920
And I rolled down the windows like, like, what, what, what are you yelling at me?

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:13.920
And the guy said, I'm with you, brother, because he had shaved his head too.

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:17.920
That's awesome.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.920
And he, and he ran in sharing the story because it's like, it's a visceral thing.

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:22.920
Yeah.

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:28.920
Attached to, attached to every little, little ugly, terrible, like, like racist thing.

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:31.920
It's all this, and to tie it all into porn.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:35.920
Look how fucking, look how fucking unracistly racist porn is.

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:39.920
Like, like, like, like, that's so crazy that like in an industry that's just like has no

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:45.920
tact, no accountability, nothing at all, you'd expect it to be a fetid wasteland of

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.920
fucking horrible racist shit.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:50.920
The internet in general is, you can go to websites that are just like, oh, these are

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.920
horrible charts.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.920
And here's a presidential candidate just retweeting them.

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:59.920
Like, but porn itself is just like, yeah, put that big black dick and here's a big,

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:05.920
but it's like, it's not like, it doesn't, it doesn't like, it doesn't, it, it, it, it,

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:10.920
it, it, it, it, it like treats, it treats race as if it's like hair color or height

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:13.920
or like, it's like, it's like, oh, what are you into?

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:14.920
You know?

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:17.920
And so it's like, it's all equivalent.

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:21.920
Who's yelling, yeah, put that big black dick in the room.

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:22.920
It's like an announcement.

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:23.920
Probably Nick Manning.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.920
Big black dick!

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.920
No, I was trying to think of an example.

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:34.920
I'm always like, I always feel like as a child of the 70s, whenever I see like interracial

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:38.920
this or anything like that, I always like brace myself for something that's going to

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.920
like, make me uncomfortable.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:45.920
Like, like even in the privacy of my own bed, like, like with my laptop open, I'm like

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:49.920
still going like, don't, don't, don't make this awkward for me.

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:54.920
Like, like, like, but, but nine times out of ten, it's simply just a celebration of

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.920
like, like, like whatever.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:59.920
It's like, like, like people go to dark places when they're, that's a pun.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:00.920
The.

01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:01.920
Didn't have to be.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:02.920
Didn't have to be.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.920
Didn't have to be.

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.920
People, people, people, people are just like fulfilling themselves.

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.920
And it's like, like, like, like, it's like, there's a, there's a line passage.

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:15.920
Like, like, like things that are like absolutely inappropriate that are like shielding terrible,

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:18.920
terrible, hateful feelings that you're being dishonest about.

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:22.920
And then you go to these crevices where people go to like just pleasure themselves.

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:28.920
These, these public toilets that we consider so non-sacred, but it's, it's remarkable

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:36.920
to me and notable to me that you don't see like a lot of what you would qualify as racism

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:41.920
in these ridiculous circuses, although you see acknowledgment of race.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:42.920
Well, okay.

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.920
So counterpoint.

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:49.920
First of all, that stuff doesn't actually, it's not real.

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:50.920
So it's in there.

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:54.920
So you have people who are in, people who are actively racist, indulging their sort of

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.920
isolated fantasies and that stuff.

01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:02.920
I mean, it's that, the fact that there's this category is exist because we like, well,

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:07.920
well, let's be really specific though, because like, like, like, like, like, wouldn't you

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.920
expect to see like, I don't know.

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:13.920
Well, now I've got, if I riff an example, I'm just going to like fucking like hit all,

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:14.920
like hit all the notes.

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:21.920
There's, there's, there's, uh, uh, Brazzers, which is basically just world famous.

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:26.920
I mean, but it's a, but it's a, it's a touchstone.

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:30.920
It's, it's, it's a comedic touchstone because it's just, it literally is just sanctioned

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:34.920
violence against whoever is the, whether it's women, usually it's women.

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:36.920
Uh, if it's black women, then it's black women.

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:40.920
And then you double by a power of two, the amount of horseshit that you're like putting

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:46.920
into, uh, into, into this, into this, this narrative, um, that is, that is porn.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:51.920
And it's, and it's it because you are, there's a task agreement that because you're clicking

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:55.920
into it and you're doing it or you're watching it or you've bought it or you're, it's being

01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.920
shown somewhere and you're watching it in a community of people.

01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:58.920
That's okay.

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.920
So okay, that exists on the outside of it.

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:04.920
If you look at it and do an inventory of what's going on, it's horrifying.

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:08.920
And it's just that they contributes often to, well, what's horrifying.

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.920
I just want, I want to get more specific.

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:15.920
Like, like, you're very, you're, you, like, like, like, like, can we just like trade

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:20.920
like, like things that are like, you know what, this is part of the problem, not part

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:21.920
of the solution.

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.920
This is, uh, ridiculous, but not actually causing any part of the problem.

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:31.920
And then is there something that's like actively maybe making the world a better place while

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:36.920
still being porn, which, which would be a new category of porn in any respect.

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:40.920
I mean, everything is like, and first of all, inherently misogynist.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:49.920
Yeah, I just don't think that to isolate it as a Disneyland Paris where this kind of stuff

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:55.920
happens where things are a little bit correct, but, uh, lovely things happen, you know.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:56.920
Right.

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.920
Wait, no, I think you might have misunderstood me.

01:23:58.920 --> 01:23:59.920
Okay.

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:03.920
I'm saying like in a world where you can, where Donald Trump is like pulling fucking charts

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:07.920
that are about, there's like, there's a difference between genuine racism and then

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:14.920
this just dumb, like 90 IQ playfulness of like, if you're like, like, we keep thinking that

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:18.920
like, like, like first of all, like ignorance does lead to hatred because if you're ignorant,

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:24.920
you can be like revved up by people who are willing to take advantage of you.

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:31.920
The people who aren't actively invested in your hatred are, for instance, pornographers.

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:40.920
They're invested in your animalistic like release and your indulgence of like crazy taboo fantasies.

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:47.920
So I think it's very notable psychologically that in politics, you will hear more genuinely

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:55.920
problematically racist things put forward in ways that actually last and lead to policies

01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:01.920
and things like that. When if you, if you, if you were to go into the porn world where

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:05.920
supposedly everyone's a fucking idiot and therefore they should be the most racist people

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:10.920
in the world, but no, because they're not incentivized by hatred, they're, they may be

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:11.920
totally inappropriate.

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:15.920
They're not the most stylistically like savvy people in the world.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:18.920
So you have just people going like, hey, click here.

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.920
If you want to watch a white woman take two giant big black cocks because you know how

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.920
black those fucking big cocks are.

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:33.920
Like it's not like, it's, it's, it's, if you're, if you're, if you're like all of those, all

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.920
of these, I mean the only difference between like that example and the other example is

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:45.920
that those guys at the end of their end game is policy, public policy, legislation and porn

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:49.920
people aren't really, their end game isn't that.

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:52.920
I don't know what they're doing either, but I'm fucking locked into you.

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:54.920
All of these words, but there are all of these.

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.920
And your big black mind.

01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.920
Take it down.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:05.920
It's fucking stretching my little white racist hole out.

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:10.920
You'd be shocked what you're capable of.

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:16.920
There are, but these are all sort of microcosms and each one of those has at its core a resonator

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.920
and that resonator hits all of these points.

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:22.920
So all the things you're saying that the politicians doing that Trump is doing also exist

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:25.920
and are in play in the world of porn.

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:33.920
So yes, some of these things and their abstracted way draw people who are going to see this

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.920
and somehow their world is going to open a little bit or whatever.

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:42.920
But again, within that whole idea that of ignorance, there is, there is selective,

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:45.920
there is this ignorance where somebody is ignorant and they are not in control of the fact that

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.920
they don't know anything, they don't know it.

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.920
That's that.

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:55.920
Then there is, there is this sort of selected ignorance where people choose to stay ignorant

01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:01.920
because they know that outside of that fence more information comes that may change the way they are

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.920
or that shakes them from their sort of their pedestal.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.920
And a lot of what you see in porn is that.

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.920
It's just fence building to keep people in a world that allows them to do whatever.

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:16.920
And you know, it's a zero sum game in the sense that if that person never ventures out of their house

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:20.920
then we don't know what ill will they're harboring.

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:26.920
But some of those people and some factor in a one to ten sample, some of those two people do enter out.

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:31.920
And in that sample, there are some people who do things that are not great.

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:35.920
And of that, some of those things become public and then we on the outside look at those people and go,

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:40.920
well, how do we get to this? How do we come to this place? How did this person get here?

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:44.920
So I think that all of it's in play and all of these are, even in music, it's the same stuff.

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:48.920
And we can have the same kinds of debates about people using the n-word and rap

01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:50.920
and people who, you know, with that.

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:55.920
In all manners of entertainment, we have always used that to express like from the time when it was like,

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:58.920
okay, Rob, don't you fucking move.

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:01.920
Oh, he's putting his phone away. Okay. I thought he was leaving again.

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.920
My phone away.

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:13.920
Well, because entertainment is visceral and it's like, yeah, if you take racism into the

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:18.920
world of media, you're probably not going to get disabused of it within media.

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.920
That's what we tend to do wrong.

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.920
And then we applaud things that we go like, you know what, this is so good.

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:28.920
It might like a Norman Lear sitcom or something like that.

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:32.920
You go like, this is so good that you could come into it racist and leave,

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:37.920
possibly somehow having been tricked into your mind opening a little bit.

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:44.920
I'm not, when we're holding the yardstick of whether or not it's doing good or bad

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:50.920
or that it's like, I think we're probably on the same page and looking at it.

01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:55.920
Like the thing that I'm saying is sort of remarkable is just that it's like,

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.920
okay, so compare it to religion.

01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.920
Like, why would there be more racism, more prevalent in religion?

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:06.920
And I know what you're talking about is what you, like, okay, racism is the fences

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:07.920
that you're talking about.

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.920
So any place where you're conscious of race, then you're not helping, right?

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:11.920
That's racism.

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:12.920
That's sexism.

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:18.920
That's bias of learned, like a chosen bias, I would say, selected bias.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:19.920
People who are knowingly.

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:26.920
So like in all porn, you're always watching a woman get like fucked by a guy.

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:27.920
Not in all porn.

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:30.920
No, sometimes just Scooby-Doo.

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:38.920
I'm saying like, for women, women have been dealing with this forever.

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:49.920
It's like pornography tends to involve, it's a difficult highway cone set to navigate taking

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:51.920
your feminism into pornography.

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:55.920
There's a lot of dumb people making a lot of stuff and etc.

01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:02.920
And so the outer edges of how you define it and the people who have a sense of pushing

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:07.920
borders of sexuality and how it's accepted are the ones who are trying to sort of, who

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:12.920
have always tried to sort of make it a thing so that you leave it as a choice for the other

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:15.920
person to decide what it is they want to be comfortable with.

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:19.920
But you also try to take things that people are uncomfortable with and make them understand

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.920
that there are other sensibilities out there.

01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:25.920
But it gets like all things, it gets corrupted and it gets changed by the money makers.

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.920
You look at the things that are, for example, I don't know if this will make any sense,

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:37.920
but there was a time when Walmart or a chain of some sort selected to remove any Rush album

01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:43.920
with the Starman symbol on it because he was nude and that was perceived to be sexual and

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:47.920
trying to force polygram or mercury to take that symbol off of the Rush album covers.

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.920
I sure it just wasn't because Rush sucks.

01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:51.920
All right, let's not get distracted.

01:30:51.920 --> 01:31:01.920
All right, well, let me, I think after the show, DeMorge, after the show.

01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:05.920
Every time we have a conversation of any gravity, I perceive myself as just dragging you back

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:11.920
into a pettiness, but thought of another, just another example, which is that, okay,

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:18.920
on Twitter we have an African American president who I noted at one point, like, he can't tweet

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:20.920
his team can't tweet.

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:22.920
Health care is good.

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:23.920
Going good.

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.920
Gotta keep that Guantanamo going.

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:26.920
Everybody, I'm the president.

01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:27.920
He makes a tweet.

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:32.920
If you look through the replies invariably, at least one use of the end word.

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:35.920
If Flotus' Twitter is worse.

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:39.920
Well, let me just finish my little thing.

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:47.920
So, isn't it a little crazy that if you go to Pornhub Premium, now available for gift

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:48.920
prices.

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:51.920
But for how long?

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:55.920
And they do have, like Pornhuts have comment sections, and they have titles, and they

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:58.920
have editors, and they have directors, and they have writers, and they have actors.

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:03.920
You don't, I don't, you, that seething hatred.

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:07.920
Maybe it's because, like, if you're going, if you're looking at porn, you're usually

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.920
doing it by yourself in the privacy of your own home, and there's no agenda to it.

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:14.920
Well, maybe it's because when you're looking at porn, you already feel like you're doing

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:18.920
something wrong, therefore you're actually in an honest zone.

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:24.920
So, you've actually compartmentalized yourself, and it's like the ambition to be a good person

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:32.920
may be, like, hugely responsible, like, for so many things that we do wrong to each other.

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:36.920
I also think with the president's side, a lot of that stuff, you leave up because you

01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:39.920
want the world to see sort of what is out there.

01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:40.920
You don't want to pretend it.

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:45.920
I don't follow her, but you're saying that Flotus, that she, well, but that's not, but

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:50.920
I mean, it's not just her, because, I mean, Rosa M. Barr gets annihilated.

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.920
I think we're straight from the point, though.

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:56.920
I don't think porn sites cull their comment sections for racism.

01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:01.920
I'm just saying, I hadn't thought about the fact that, you know, Mr. Obama's getting nailed

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:03.920
every time she opens her mouth on Twitter, of course.

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:06.920
About anything, and some of it, and much of it isn't racist.

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:08.920
It's just weird, sexist stuff.

01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.920
Oh, it's terrible.

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.920
But you leave it up.

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:19.920
I mean, you look at, like, so, okay, when Obama was first elected president, there's a song

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:25.920
called, I forget what it's called, it's a country song by...

01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:27.920
Shoot, I can't think of any guys there.

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:28.920
Williams Jr.?

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:29.920
No, sir.

01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:30.920
It's a good guess.

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:33.920
But it's called, I think it's called a monkey president or something like that.

01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:34.920
They came out now.

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:35.920
Here's the trick.

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.920
Hear me out.

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:37.920
Hear me out.

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:40.920
It's a legit country song.

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.920
It is, it's not Roy A. Cuff.

01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.920
It's somebody like, and I'm not, I don't want to attach any names to this, but it's somebody...

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:46.920
It's like Toby Keith.

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:47.920
Is it Toby Keith?

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:48.920
No, no, no.

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:50.920
Your way, this is old school.

01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:53.920
This is in the highwayman era.

01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:57.920
But when you look at the song, and people were great, people were just throwing the song out there,

01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:00.920
posting it everywhere, et cetera, et cetera, and people were appalled in this day and time.

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:02.920
People would write a song like this, et cetera.

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:05.920
The song is from 1975 or 1906, it turns out.

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:07.920
And it was written about Jimmy Carter.

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:10.920
But you have people who are so anxious to do something, and they go,

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.920
remember that song from a long time ago?

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:16.920
And then they pull it out, digitize it, send it out, and just start this chain that goes on.

01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:17.920
Because that's what's out there.

01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:18.920
They love it.

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.920
You know, you go into that wormhole and you see it.

01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:25.920
And there was a time on Myspace where I stumbled onto a clan site.

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.920
Like a guy's page, it just was in the clan.

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:28.920
That was it.

01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:33.920
And the graphic design, when I went through his friends, it occurred to me suddenly that

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:39.920
the clan had their own sort of sub, people who were just their friends

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:41.920
who market their graphic design skills out to them.

01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:43.920
And they're clan-specific.

01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:47.920
Just glittering stars and horses with hoods.

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:49.920
Gifts, gifs, whatever.

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.920
Just riding around the back of your biode.

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.920
Riding in the background.

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:55.920
I mean, this stuff exists out there.

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:56.920
And what do you do?

01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:57.920
You don't wipe it away.

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:00.920
One of the benefits of the world that we live in now is that we see all this,

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:04.920
so that it's not just whispered about and it's not just shadows sort of drifting around in the corners.

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.920
Do you feel that's a good thing?

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:08.920
I mean, it's a thing.

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:11.920
No, it could be seen.

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:15.920
Yeah, and I think that there's enough stuff going on in the world right now that we don't have time to be...

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:16.920
Sorry.

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:23.920
The Rule 34 thing, you think that there's any porn where it's guys dressed up as KKK's fucking Scooby-Doo's?

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:25.920
Well, I was going to say...

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:27.920
If not now, there will be tomorrow.

01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:31.920
There is not a dearth of KKK... I've stumbled onto KKK sites.

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.920
I've stumbled onto cartoons of like...

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.920
Stumbled?

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:35.920
Terrible...

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:39.920
Fair enough.

01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:41.920
Fair enough.

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:48.920
Might as well stay here.

01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:53.920
And I do, because I'm like, holy fuck.

01:35:53.920 --> 01:36:02.920
And I don't stumble into what I would call racist porn.

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:05.920
I stumble into what I would call constantly a...

01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:08.920
I guess what maybe you and I would agree is like a...

01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:12.920
What do you call it?

01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:14.920
A perpetuation of fences in porn.

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.920
I mean, like the idea...

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:21.920
If you want to know that black guys have huge dicks

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.920
and then all this stuff, like you're not going to be...

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:27.920
There's not a lot of activity going on in porn that's supposed to...

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:29.920
That's designed to like below...

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:31.920
Like, like, sophisticate you.

01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:36.920
But what you don't see is like videos where it's like...

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:42.920
Where people are being dehumanized actively in the narrative.

01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:43.920
Except the website.

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:44.920
I'm sorry, what?

01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:45.920
Where is it?

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:50.920
I don't see like white guys saying to black guys in porn

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:55.920
like, hey, you're not a human being, so you should fuck this person.

01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:56.920
Like it's not...

01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:58.920
I don't see like racist shit.

01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:06.920
I see consciousness of race and horrible affirmation of like off the top stereotypes

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:08.920
because they're not brave people.

01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:10.920
I gotta get porn to a premium then.

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:11.920
What are you watching?

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:17.920
Can you at least just say, just tell me a piece of porn that you watched that was like...

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:20.920
I don't even... I just know like, okay, let's say...

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:21.920
Where you're like, this is fucked up.

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:25.920
I'm walking away from this fucking like, this is...

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:26.920
No, I don't...

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:27.920
I think it's...

01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:32.920
The big thing is generally like the abuse of the women and it's like...

01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:34.920
Jeff, please put a sock in it.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.920
I asked him a question.

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:38.920
I was saying like, I don't think...

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:42.920
What you're saying is like, if you want to go into a site and watch little...

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:45.920
I think if you look hard enough, you'll find it.

01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:47.920
Did you look hard enough?

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:48.920
No.

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:49.920
Okay.

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:50.920
It just showed up.

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:51.920
All right.

01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:52.920
I mean, that's what I'm saying.

01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:53.920
What did you see?

01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:54.920
It just showed up.

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:55.920
What did you see that just showed up?

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:56.920
Everything you just described.

01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:57.920
What?

01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.920
Just words, weird, shaming.

01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:00.920
Yeah.

01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:01.920
You saw...

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:03.920
You actually saw like, so like actual...

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:04.920
Yeah, man.

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:08.920
Like status, like where they're low status, like where the black protagonist is low status.

01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:09.920
It's...

01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:10.920
Yes.

01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:11.920
Absolutely.

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:12.920
I mean, it's right there.

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:13.920
It's there.

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:14.920
It's even there.

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:15.920
If you're looking at...

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:19.920
If you're looking at something else and it's linked to porn related stuff,

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.920
it's in the advertising on the side because it's...

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:24.920
Because that world is full of people who just...

01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:28.920
Who in that zone, it's catch, just catch can.

01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:31.920
If you don't want to see it, you're not going to hit click and go through that door.

01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:32.920
If you want to see it, you'll go through the door.

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:36.920
Whether whatever your intentions are, if you're curious and you just want to do field recordings

01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:38.920
in your mind of what's out there, you'll go through there.

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.920
If that's what you need, then you'll go through there.

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:41.920
Right.

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:42.920
Whatever that stuff is.

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:43.920
I mean, that...

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:44.920
Probably a majority of it is it's probably...

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:52.920
It's an extension of the misogyny because it's the gang bang, kind of like, oh, this woman...

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:54.920
It's like where the...

01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:59.920
It's like, oh, no, the black guys are going to come in and they're being...

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:00.920
To be honest with you...

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.920
Characterizes a force of nature rather than...

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:06.920
Feel like there's a lot of stuff and it's in a normal world.

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:11.920
Let's say you work in human resources and there's four or five people in the cubicles section with you.

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:16.920
And you hate Frank and you have some problems with Laurie and this, that, and the other.

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:22.920
But right now we are living in a world where you are constantly reminded that those things are misguided,

01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.920
malintended, you really can't do that in the real world.

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:34.920
It wasn't too long ago that you could print out a list of the ten most sexist jokes you could think of,

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:39.920
ten most racist things you could think of and pass it around and the people that were with you would do it.

01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:40.920
You can't do that shit anymore.

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:44.920
You can't do that shit or you've got to go dark web about it and then if you get fined out you're fired and you can't.

01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.920
But you can and every once in a while you see this happens.

01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:50.920
Now you can't and those people are constantly reminded that they've got to either adjust,

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:55.920
open up their world and figure out a way to be or they've got to calcify themselves and harden,

01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:00.920
ossify and like tighten up and what they're banking on often in these sites I think is that,

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:05.920
you know, you've got to go somewhere, you know, you've got to put yourself someplace.

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.920
They're saying, here's a room and here's a jar, you know, squeeze in whatever...

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:12.920
That was a very compelling argument that I finally registered in my head.

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:14.920
Yeah, I do think that that's what it is.

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:17.920
You're saying that's enabling.

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:22.920
I think what I heard you just say is that there's actually hope for the future in terms of that,

01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:28.920
that as progress happens there's restraint happening and actually these crevices that you can go down

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:33.920
and explore deep darkness that those are actually just enabling like something that maybe should...

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.920
I wonder if the...

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:37.920
We should cut off.

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.920
I wonder if the market model hasn't changed to that now where it's just sort of these things that you...

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:44.920
Trust me, it's a holiday.

01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:48.920
Many of you are going to go home and you're going to have people sitting at the table who are going to say something

01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:51.920
and the whole table is going to stop and look and they're like, what?

01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:54.920
Y'all didn't care about that three years ago.

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:59.920
But those people, imagine being that person and every single day television,

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:07.920
everything, commercials, are reminding you that where you thought you had planted yourself in life is where you're going to stay

01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:10.920
and not only are you behind the curve, but you've been behind for a long time.

01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:13.920
It just didn't get loud enough until now for you to see it.

01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:16.920
So the amount of catch-up work you're going to have to do is...

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.920
That mountain is steep and you've either got to run hard and run fast and run long

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:26.920
or run slowly and probably not live to see your sort of comeuppance.

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:29.920
But it can be an exhausting proposition.

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:35.920
So what do you do? You live day to day to day and under the weight of that thing.

01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:41.920
And I mean, if you read Rick Bass or the authors of the modern...

01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:42.920
And I will.

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:48.920
The modern American authors right now who are writing, who have replaced the Mailers and the Updates and the Carvers,

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:51.920
these are the pressures that they're writing about right now.

01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:58.920
The protagonists, the Carver protagonists, back then, often what they were dealing with was marriage

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:02.920
and relationships and modern relationships and the things that we've been taught

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:06.920
and how those things don't necessarily apply because the world around us is changing.

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:12.920
And so how do suburban dreams continue to exist?

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:15.920
How do we keep that framework up when everything around us is changing?

01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:21.920
You know, that kind of stuff. What's changing now, I think, is affecting people individually who come from that world

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:28.920
because they now have to get out of that neighborhood and they have to deal with a whole other set of principles

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:34.920
and that tension in those people, that coiled tension.

01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:41.920
If you offer a release to somebody and say nobody can see it because it's happening in a world that is gridless, basically.

01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:48.920
You think that's, you're saying that's like the ring of power, that's like giving a piece of heroin.

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:56.920
You're saying there's a lot of that sort of pebble of incentive stuff going on in people.

01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:01.920
I'm having a totally different experience that is absolutely, probably equally valid.

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:09.920
I would even probably go so far as a self-loathing person to say your point of view is way more valid.

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:16.920
But I'm having the exact opposite experience right now because I just got divorced,

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:27.920
which means that I lived in a world like for years where everything was about the obligations that I had to everybody around me.

01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:33.920
And of course, middle-aged men, they get divorced and then they, characteristically, they get the tattoo and the Tesla

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:39.920
and they start saying inappropriate things to their younger coworkers and they just turn into douchey cavemen.

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:47.920
And I think part of that is that it's like this pendulum that swings back and forth between reality and fantasy.

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:55.920
And I think that in a world where we all have like USB slots in our foreheads at this point,

01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:02.920
I think one of our biggest issues that we're contending with that we haven't actually labeled is the division between fantasy and reality.

01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:11.920
Because we are such a successful empire and one of the things that we've successfully done so much is created

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:17.920
like these dreams that we dream together and we don't even really, all we do is go to work and pull levers

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:19.920
and then it's like we watch six hours of TV a day.

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:27.920
So it's like we don't actually, it's like actually a big deal if someone on TV makes us think a certain thing

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:33.920
or represents a certain demographic as a thing, it's like we look at that as the same as a senator voting wrong

01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:40.920
and we get very upset and I think one of the big crucial issues is we have so little respect for ourselves

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:48.920
that we can't actively go, here's reality and here's actually like, here's my biochemistry,

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:55.920
here's like my fucked upness which is this sewer where I like watch dinosaurs chase motorcycles

01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:59.920
but we won't do it because then the guy in the motorcycle goes by the way I'm running for president next week

01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:04.920
and we're like oh really, yeah that makes sense, of course you would, you outran a dinosaur

01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:11.920
and if the dinosaur says like you should buy a Panasonic but Panasonic turns out to make landmines

01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:18.920
we're like oh I'm going to boycott your company, we have no division, because we sit around and just watch,

01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:28.920
we were the third act of WALL-E, like we just sit and watch shit, like that shit actually ironically is

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:37.920
toxically infected with reality, because right now what I'm experiencing is a douchey middle aged divorcee

01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:43.920
is like indulgence in fantasy and it's making me a happier person in my day to day life

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:51.920
because I'm actually actively able to like I go ugh and I come and then I go time to go to work, that was dark

01:45:51.920 --> 01:46:06.920
and then I'm like something got, I feel like something got, now in my mind what my view is something got released

01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:12.920
and what your view is which is equally valid as I said if not more is that maybe something got along the way

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:18.920
depending on what you're indulging maybe there's seeds getting planted, there's things being affirmed or perpetuated

01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:22.920
I just think that people are different, I think that on the other end of that the moneymaker end of it

01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:28.920
the reason somebody, I mean you have no idea the guys programming these sites, people programming these sites

01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:34.920
might be the most liberal, most understanding people in the world but from a moneymaking end of it they understand that

01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:46.920
that's the goose, so that's the golden goose and so they're just going to keep finding ways to maximize that potential

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:55.920
and you can see what you were talking about in this run of GOP debates from the first one up to the last one this past week

01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:00.920
there's no reason any of these debates said anything that anybody needs to think anything about

01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:06.920
there's no reason any of these polls say anything that anybody really needs to think anything about

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:13.920
what's going to happen is in January we're going to wipe all that, anybody who knows anything is going to wipe all that shit out

01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:20.920
Iowa is going to happen, I believe New Hampshire still is going to happen next and so and that's a caucus I think

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:26.920
and so what's going to happen is that whole paradigm is going to fall away and if you ask the question

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:31.920
well why the hell do we spend so much time on it, well there are so many cottage industries that are connected to

01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:38.920
the idea of broadcasting that, making graphics for it, making that sort of Mad Max Fury Road

01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:44.920
flaming guitar theme music for it that scares the shit out of us and all that other stuff

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:48.920
I don't know, that Ted Cruz guy, he's got the goods

01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:56.920
but wait, in January when we start having our first debates that's when it actually really counts, that's when it matters

01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:59.920
and from that point on you can calibrate and in the past that's the way it's been

01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:04.920
but it's interesting how many more debates there are in the lead up to this given this particular situation

01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:09.920
and to watch this happen and watch how many people are talking about it, how many headlines are posted about it

01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:17.920
how many are in gigantic bold, just as if this is the Lindbergh baby resolution and none of this shit is real

01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:22.920
well you've given us the perfect segue into our regular segment Rob Schrab's Politics Corner

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:36.920
music

01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:42.920
yeah yeah sorry I dug my hand in there but you know what I hate

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:51.920
what do you hate Rob? Christmas greed, this game, you ever go to like a family thing

01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:55.920
or like a work thing, it's called like the white elephant game

01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:57.920
oh right yeah we all do that

01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:05.920
that's a stupid game, stupid, everybody's like I don't know, oh god I don't like it

01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:08.920
that was Rob Schrab's Politics Corner

01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:16.920
music

01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:19.920
Rob, that was a good one too

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:26.920
I gotta say, I didn't think you could top your last Politics Corner, that one, it was trenchant, it was biting, it was incisive

01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:30.920
how do you feel about Ted Cruz's shenanigans?

01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:32.920
the skateboard guy?

01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:40.920
music

01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:46.920
I don't know anything, I don't know, I couldn't, if you showed, if Ted Cruz was standing in front of me

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:49.920
I wouldn't know, I've never seen the man

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.920
I don't know what he looks like, I don't know if it's a guy, I don't know

01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:54.920
it was a Mission Impossible 5

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:56.920
was it? God damn it

01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:58.920
oh shit sorry

01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:00.920
just it's for the seat, it's not

01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:04.920
oh my god

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:06.920
sorry

01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:08.920
I've disgraced the seat

01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:12.920
alright, how do we wrap up a show with no Spencer?

01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:14.920
um

01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:21.920
I'll just yell cliffhanger and I'll play this

01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:23.920
music

01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:25.920
come on

01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:30.920
are we doing a show next Sunday or do we have a show, are we gonna be gone?

01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:33.920
no no no, no show next week, wait

01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:36.920
yes, you'll be in New York

01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.920
I'll be in New York next week so there's no show, but also

01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:40.920
what are you doing in New York?

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:44.920
January 3rd, there was gonna be a show, it's my birthday

01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:45.920
it's your birthday

01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:47.920
and I'll still be in New York, so

01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:48.920
have fun

01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:51.920
sorry, so this is our last show of 2015

01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:54.920
oh we should do one of our end of the year recaps

01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:58.920
alright

01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:02.920
Rob, you want to take us through the year in Harmonetown?

01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:06.920
what do you think, what's different from where we started?

01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:10.920
I don't know, I wasn't here at the beginning of the year

01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:12.920
well just make it up

01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:13.920
make it up?

01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:15.920
DeMorge, what do you think?

01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:16.920
I guess we're done with me

01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:21.920
has Harmonetown grown in any way or changed or have we devolved?

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:28.920
yes

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:35.920
Cliff Hanger!

01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:40.920

want to give a shout out for William Metsuka

01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:26.920
spend the rest of the year noticing that pornography is ironically less racist than politics and religion

01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:29.920
it's all I ask

01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:32.920
