{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:10.000\nFrom Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, the Nerdist Theater, Melty, Melty Theater,\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:13.000\nHarmontown, is now in session.\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:20.000\nLet's just get this thing rolling.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:24.000\nThe mayor of Harmontown is Dan Harmon.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:28.000\nThank you.\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:40.000\nI'm very, very, very sorry that Spencer is not with us tonight.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:42.000\nIs he okay?\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:45.000\nWell, I mean, he'll be fine.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:48.000\nYou know, he rarely, as you know, he doesn't call in sick.\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:51.000\nHe said he had a headache that was so bad.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:55.000\nLike, if he wanted to fake something, he could fake better than a headache.\n\n00:55.000 --> 01:01.000\nBut he said, yeah, it's a headache that's so bad that it's actually making him kind of nauseous and stuff.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:08.000\nSo I said, hey man, just as long as you feed the cat.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:11.000\nHe's still under your employee, but he has that.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:14.000\nHe really did still have to. He didn't have to. He could have bowed out of that too.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:24.000\nAll he had to do was hand off the cat instructions and medicine regimens and things to the cat sitter.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:31.000\nI'm writing in a hotel right now with Chris McKenna, like, trying desperately to finish a pilot before I leave for the holidays.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:33.000\nYou guys don't care.\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:37.000\nWhy the hotel? Why not the two distracting at home?\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:41.000\nWell, no. I mean, Chris is allergic to the dogs and stuff.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:45.000\nSo then he starts sneezing and wheezing and there's just dander everywhere.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:48.000\nIt doesn't matter if you lock the dogs out.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:51.000\nWhat hotel are you standing at?\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:55.000\nThe Redberry.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:58.000\nWhat room?\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:02.000\nBefore that, we were at a place in West Hollywood.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:05.000\nWe keep getting hotel suites and trying to finish this thing.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:09.000\nI'm sure we've spent more on hotel suites than we would ever make on the TV show.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:17.000\nBut anyways, continuing the apology department, I'm very sorry about last week's show.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nI thought it was a good show.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:22.000\nI listened to it. I was a little embarrassed.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:25.000\nI was just one of those really, really drunk shows.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.000\nI thought Rob was very funny.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:31.000\nI was a little obnoxious.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\nI was a little combative, you pointed out.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:35.000\nI was a little angry.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:38.000\nI was picking fights and stuff.\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:43.000\nI was definitely slurring my words and it was kind of like out of it.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.000\nSo tonight you've made a vow to not drink during the show.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:49.000\nWell, if I started...\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:53.000\nJeff said to stand hoisted a red solo cup to his mouth.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:57.000\nI only get that kind of drink if I've been drinking since like 9am.\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:59.000\nSo you're just kicking off right now?\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:00.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:02.000\nPut the pedal to the metal, baby.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:06.000\nYeah, we could butt chug and I would be fine.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:08.000\nKids don't butt chug.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:11.000\nAdults do butt chug.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:16.000\nIt's Christmastime in Los Angeles, all of the...\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:23.000\nOh my God, please just go into like a burr alive song right now.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:26.000\nI heard myself sounding too...\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:28.000\nThey say prancer and dancer.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:32.000\nAll the assistants are gone already.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:35.000\nThat's how you can tell it's Christmastime in Los Angeles.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:37.000\nSome things are just desolate and...\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:38.000\nI really like LA.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:41.000\nWho's staying in town for the holidays?\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:43.000\nYou guys are lucky.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:46.000\nDon't get tricked into thinking that you have to go places.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:51.000\nI've been going places every Christmas for the last four or five years probably.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:53.000\nIt's been a million years since I...\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:57.000\nOr four or five, which just caught me in my math.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:02.000\nIf you just stay still in Los Angeles, it's one of the most beautiful holidays you'll ever have.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nGo to the roost, have an eggnog, as we always say.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nEverywhere you go, it's just like...\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nBecause everybody else fucks off and then you just like...\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:10.000\nIt's LA the way it probably...\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:17.000\nIt's like a two week long Coachella where all the assholes are gone.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nIt's probably nice in New York too, where I'm going.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:21.000\nAnd where you'll be joining me.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:22.000\nI'll be there too?\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:25.000\nAre you going to be there for Christmas or after Christmas?\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:26.000\nYeah, I'm coming just after.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:28.000\nThe whole Shibootz.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:29.000\nThe whole Shibootz?\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nI didn't know you spoke Yiddish.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:32.000\nYep.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:41.000\nAll the Mishigas.\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:48.000\nJeff, are you aware of Snapchat?\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:51.000\nI would be lying if I said I knew anything about it.\n\n04:51.000 --> 05:03.000\nSnapchat is a new thing for millennials that empowers them by virtue of temporary media\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:09.000\nstorage to show their impulsive side.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:14.000\nHow often have you been at Disneyland and been drunk with your friends on turkey leg\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:16.000\nand just wanted to express that and then thought...\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:18.000\nYou know that most of the turkey leg is Facebook?\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:19.000\nIt's emu.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nA lot of that turkey leg is emu.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nThat was not where it's interrupting me.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:27.000\nYeah, but Dan, you're in the pocket of big turkey.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nYes, it's emu.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:31.000\nThe turkey leg's emu.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:32.000\nSorry, go ahead.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.000\nWe'll get back to the emus.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:37.000\nSay, if the kids are out there and you're feeling good and you're having a good time,\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:46.000\nyou're at one of your foam parties or your hologram jerk-offs.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:57.000\nWhere the hologram jerks you off into a cup that's off the grid.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:07.000\nBefore you take a bike ride with your dog and put your phone in a box.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:11.000\nYou might think, oh, I just want to express this, but you put it on Facebook.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:16.000\nAnd how do you know if 20 years from now when you're running for senator,\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:19.000\nyou know, it's not going to be politically incorrect to say,\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:24.000\nWhat's up, G-Hards?\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:27.000\nI'm riding a bike with my dog.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:31.000\nIs the dog on his own bike or is he in a basket like 18?\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:35.000\nDog's in the basket with your phone.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:40.000\nSnapchat lets you say stuff like that and then it's like, oh, it'll be gone in a little bit.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nHow long does it exist?\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:47.000\nWell, there's a lot of different functionality that they've been adding to Snapchat, Jeff.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:53.000\nThere's your standard foundational dick pic technology, which is not dick pic proof.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nWe're not talking about dick pics. That's always been a zero sum game.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nPeople can screen grab your dick pics.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:01.000\nSnapchat will notify you that your dick pic has been grabbed.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:04.000\nAnd it will say who grabbed your dick pic?\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:11.000\nIt'll say Jeff Davis grabbed your pic, yes, and you'll go like, hmm, interesting.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:15.000\nAnd then we're not friends anymore unless we have a conversation.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:18.000\nOh, maybe I wanted you to grab my dick.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nThe night is very young.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:23.000\nThese new courtship rituals are erupting out of this stuff.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:27.000\nSo it's videos, pictures, both? Either one?\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:31.000\nAnd then it lives, how long does it live?\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\n10 seconds?\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\n24 hours, depending on how you...\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:38.000\nWell, like I said, there's two different functionalities.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:47.000\nI can just take a picture or a video, and I can send it to as many of my friends' followers as I want.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:52.000\nThose people can watch it once or now if they pay a nominal fee.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:53.000\nWait, what?\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nTwice.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nYou can monetize your Snapchats?\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:00.000\nWell, no. Snapchat can monetize Snapchat.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:06.000\nThe other functionality is something I find very interesting called My Story.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nThat's what I've been snapping.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:14.000\nBecause you sent me a text that was you opening your mouth in a video and a rainbow barfing out of your mouth.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:19.000\nThat was just an example of Snapchat's amazing add-ons, like visual effects.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:22.000\nBut does that go away off of my phone in 24 hours?\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:25.000\nNo, no, no, I saved that. I made that. You can save your own shit.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nAh, gotcha.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nBut my story thing is like a 24-hour buffer.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:35.000\nIt's like a treadmill, and so anything that you made 24 hours ago, that goes off the end of the treadmill.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:36.000\nYou never see that again.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:40.000\nSo you just, like, anything you make in 24 hours, that's available to...\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nThat's your story. People can click on that and go,\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.000\nOh, look what Marissa's been doing over the last...\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nGreat, I'm glad you could make it.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:58.000\nWell, I'm sure I did the most horrifying entrance and exits at the same time.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:02.000\nI'm up here talking about fucking Snapchat, waiting for this prick.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:05.000\nYeah, you're up here making podcast dynamite.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:12.000\nI hope that Rob just kept that movement and he's walking out to his car and never returns.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:19.000\nThat he was in the audience and now he's calling an Uber?\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:22.000\nThat's his story.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:23.000\nThat's his story.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:26.000\nThat's Rob's Snapchat story.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:29.000\nHe has become Snapchat.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nHe really is.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:34.000\nHe's self-srobbing, self-snapchatting.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:37.000\nWe call Schrab Snapchat now.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:42.000\nI don't know why I have this open.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:48.000\nThe bad part is comedy works in threes, so we know that's coming back.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:55.000\nI've subscribed to Pornhub Premium.\n\n09:55.000 --> 10:01.000\nI gotta say, Dan...\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:05.000\nCan I just say this?\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:13.000\nAs much as we love Erin McGathy and Misser, single you is a lot more exciting.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:16.000\nSnapping your chats?\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:20.000\nOh, by the way, I hope you don't think that he's divorced since he's Snapchatting\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:23.000\nbecause he's trying to creep on.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nI don't know if Snapchat you can use.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:26.000\nCan you creep on Snapchat?\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:27.000\nI don't know.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:28.000\nThat's not what I'm doing at all.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:29.000\nIt's narcissistic.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:32.000\nI have eight followers on Snapchat.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:36.000\nI've been Snapchatting. If you caught my story in the last 24 hours,\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:40.000\nyou would have seen the process of me trying to write a pilot with Chris McKenna\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nin a hotel room for 48 hours.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nBut now it's gone.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.000\nBecause I blew it. I didn't write it.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:49.000\nWhat is the allure? Do you follow anybody on Snapchat?\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:52.000\nAre you following Chris McKenna or anybody else?\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:56.000\nI follow my dog, Bordr.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.000\nThe guy I'm leaving my dogs with when I go to New York.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:00.000\nHe has a Snapchat.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:01.000\nYou want to know what he's up to?\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nWell, you click on him and he's like,\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nI'm in Laurel Canyon.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nAnd the dogs are like,\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:13.000\nCan I write down that guy's Snapchat address?\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nThis sounds like good shit.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nI don't know how that works.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nIs that private?\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nI don't know.\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:25.000\nWhat would be the allure of me as a friend of yours following you on Snapchat?\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nWhat's for sale there?\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:32.000\nThe inside look into the comings and goings of my comings and goings?\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:33.000\nLike, I don't know.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nWhich brings us back to porn.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:38.000\nIt's like a video Twitter feed.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:41.000\nAnd I haven't been on Twitter in weeks.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:44.000\nThe only bad thing about not being on Twitter has been that\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:47.000\nit's the only place you would go to say something like,\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:50.000\nmy life is going so well not being on Twitter.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:53.000\nIt really is something you want to just express to the world,\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nwhich Twitter is really good for.\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nNot being on Twitter is awesome.\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nWhat am I doing?\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.000\nIt's the disposable nature of Snapchat.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:06.000\nThe fact that things don't exist for good unless somebody screen grabs your dick.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:10.000\nI assume that's the allure for millennials.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nI'm a Gen Xer.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:13.000\nDied in the wool.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nI love archiving.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:17.000\nI'd like to think that all my stuff lasts forever.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:18.000\nBut you know what?\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:19.000\nYou gotta recognize.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nJeff, CDs, VHS.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:26.000\nAnd also, here's another thing that's fleeting,\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.000\nbecause I have some sad news for everybody.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nWell, it's sad news for me.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nIt'll be fodder for you.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:38.000\nI, as you know, have had a 15-year...\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nJe ne sais quoi.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nYou know, a relationship,\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:51.000\nmy longest sexual relationship with a bent plastic mannequin leg,\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:56.000\nsize six-foot, made for hosiery displays,\n\n12:56.000 --> 13:01.000\nin some golden age where hosiery displays needed to be anatomically perfect.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nBent to what degree?\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:04.000\nWhat posture is that leg?\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nBent at the knee, like...\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nHow many degrees?\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nLike, paleo.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nIt was like bouncing a...\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:10.000\nI mean, what do you...\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:11.000\nReally?\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:12.000\nOkay.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:13.000\nI got you.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.000\nWeirdest question to have, I think.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nI feel that's the weirdest question you could have.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:20.000\nIs it slightly bent, or is it bent like 45 degrees?\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nIt's bent, like 90 degrees.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\nOkay.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:24.000\nBasically, 90 degrees.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:25.000\nOkay, got you.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nSo, you guys know the drill.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:31.000\nYou put the hosiery on the leg.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:34.000\nYou take your shirt off,\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:39.000\nexposing your gigantic, ursine, oily, zip-covered,\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nhut-like frame.\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:48.000\nYou warble into bed, like a pasty cloud.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:52.000\nWe have our episode title.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:57.000\nLike a beached albino porpoise.\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:02.000\nAnd then you either watch some porn.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nMaybe you even don't.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:06.000\nMaybe you're kind of feeling like a little crazy,\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:08.000\nand you just want to focus on the leg.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:10.000\nSometimes you combine the leg with the porn?\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:11.000\nYeah.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nOkay.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nBut it doesn't really work if you're watching,\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nlike, people go fully at it, and then you're like,\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:19.000\nand then there's this leg.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:22.000\nI usually, what I'll do is, if I'm watching something\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:27.000\nwith the leg, I will watch a YouTube channel\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\ncalled Legs Lavish.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:37.000\nIt's your one-stop shop for honest reviews of hosiery\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:40.000\nfor women by women.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:44.000\nIt's by women.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:49.000\nThe comment section is like fake women's names\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nand just honest guys' names.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:52.000\nTalking about...\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nThose are great.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nTry it some more.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:01.000\nReview some more hosiery for me.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:02.000\nLegs Lavish.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:05.000\nCheck it out on YouTube.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nAlright, so sometimes you're watching the movie,\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nsometimes it's just you and the leg.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:13.000\nI recommend Alicia.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nShe's got a professional edge,\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:20.000\nand she has some winter outfits that are like...\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:23.000\nShe puts on a little yarn cap and gloves\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:26.000\nand a cashmere scarf and a sweater,\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:29.000\na short skirt, but not slutty short.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:32.000\nLike a little bit above the knee,\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:33.000\nand then these little boots,\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:36.000\nand then these, of course, the tights that she's reviewing,\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nthese winter tights.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nAnd then I might...\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:44.000\nMaybe I'll rub a mannequin leg on my nipple while I watch that.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:46.000\nAnd I'll go, that's a good review, Alicia.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nDo you prefer...\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:51.000\nDo you prefer or favor one nipple over the other?\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:53.000\nThat's usually going to end up being my left nipple.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nWho knows why?\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nMaybe because I'm right-brained.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nNo, it's because you're jerking off with your right hand\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:00.000\nbecause you're right-handed.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nOh, yeah!\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nAll right, I can't remember.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nOkay, so here's the bad news.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nThe bad news!\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nYeah.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nFucking...\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:14.000\nBuckle your holy shitbelts, everybody.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:19.000\nThis is the part where you're going to feel sorry for him.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:23.000\nUp until now, you've been Abraham Lincoln.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:29.000\nMy life's going to take a dark turn in a minute.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:39.000\nI haven't used, you know, old faithful since I got it out after the divorce.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:42.000\nAnd during the marriage, I adopted two dogs.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:45.000\nAnd so I...\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:48.000\nHello, Spaghetti-o!\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:56.000\nSo Nigel, who loves eating underwear and shoes and pens and cat food cans\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:01.000\nand ninja stars and rocks and cat shit\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:08.000\nand fucking leaf blower wires and couches and his own shit\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:13.000\nbut not enough paper towels on the roll\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:20.000\nand the fucking window cells and blankets and the stairs.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:22.000\nHe eats everything.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:26.000\nWhy would I think it was okay to rub a mannequin leg on my nipple and then go to work?\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:29.000\nJust leave it there, laying on the bed.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nNigel took old faithful down?\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nHe chewed...\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:36.000\nHe chewed exactly precisely.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nHe chewed the big toe.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nThat's your nipple toe!\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nThat's your nipple toe!\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nTurning it into a gnarled...\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:48.000\nLike, the look of it...\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nNot the texture, because this would be soft\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:54.000\nbut the look of it is like a corn cob with no corn on it.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nLike, because it's just all...\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:57.000\nYeah.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:02.000\nBut it's all hard-chewed plastic.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nHave you tried that out?\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:05.000\nNo, I can't even...\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nIt's gross to even look at.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:12.000\nEverything that's sexy about this whole thing is just smoothness and softness\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:15.000\nand, of course, autonomy and creepiness.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:20.000\nBut now it's a gnarled, like, an enemy.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:25.000\nWas there ever a time that Nigel walked in on you while you were doing that?\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:26.000\nWas there some sort of jealousy?\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:27.000\nIt was like, pay more attention than me.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:30.000\nI'm going to eat this toe off of this fucking guy.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:32.000\nLike, I told you, he eats everything.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:33.000\nOkay.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:34.000\nHe cast a white net.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nThat's so sad.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nNo, I don't think I can replace it.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:44.000\nThat thing, like I told you, I had to humiliate myself at a weird West Covino warehouse\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:45.000\nor something.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:46.000\nAll right.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.000\nLet's move on.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nOne more question.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:54.000\nHow often do you, like, go in and restock the hosiery?\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nLike, you go into...\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:56.000\nNever.\n\n18:56.000 --> 19:00.000\nLike, I'm saying, like, before this happened, like, is this a monthly, weekly, yearly...\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:01.000\nWell, it depends.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:02.000\nI mean, what do you mean?\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:05.000\nBecause the question should be how much do I buy when I buy it.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nRight, yeah.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nLike, there was a time before Amazon Prime...\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:14.000\nAndy?\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:17.000\nLethal weapon?\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:20.000\nLethal weapon.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:25.000\nThe, you know, you would have to...\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:28.000\nIf it's just a pervert going into Albertsons, you're...\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:35.000\nYou got to walk out with, like, a little package of something and, like, it looks like maybe\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:39.000\nyou could be buying it for a wife that's waiting at home and then you also have to do the fake\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:44.000\ntoothpaste and the fake, like, paper towel roll or something, like, oh, boy, I need so\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nmany random things.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:49.000\nBut you can't get 30 of those stockings.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:55.000\nI'm a better man than I could, maybe, and look at the cashier and say, I like to jerk\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:59.000\noff on a mannequin, like, I'll see you next summer.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nBecause I'm buying in bulk.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:02.000\nDid we talk about...\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:05.000\nBut with Amazon, I just...\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:06.000\nCha-ching.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:07.000\nBut no more.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:08.000\nNo more.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:09.000\nNo more.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:10.000\nBecause the things...\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:11.000\nYou're not going to try to replace it?\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:12.000\nLook, man, just...\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:13.000\nWhat did I...\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:14.000\nWe're talking in circles.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:15.000\nNo, no, I'm saying...\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:16.000\nThere's no replacing it.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:17.000\nIt's one of a kind.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:21.000\nDid you ever see Cherry 2000, the movie with Melanie Griffith and...\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nI lost my Cherry 2000.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:27.000\nI would have to go fight Tim Thomerson in the wasteland to get...\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:31.000\nJust watch it and get some culture.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:36.000\nIf Harmontown can leave you with one message, just get some culture.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nThese poor kids, they have nothing.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:39.000\nWhat do you got?\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:42.000\nThumb drives full of Wi-Fi's.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:45.000\nIsn't it possible to...\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nAnd again, I'm not trying to...\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:51.000\nTim Thomerson, look him up.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:55.000\nYou're saying now it's hard to go out and replace that because it's hard for you to\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:58.000\ngo into a store in West Covina and buy that mannequin leg.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:02.000\nOr are you saying that was just so singular and special that it's irreplaceable?\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nNo, I would...\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:06.000\nNo, I'm podcasting about it.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:10.000\nI would walk in with a marching band if I could find another model.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:18.000\nI would go, sir, I'm here for one thing alone, for one reason.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:23.000\nBut I just think I'm busy now and trying to develop TV shows and stuff.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nSo who's got the time?\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:26.000\nInteresting.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:27.000\nAll right.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:28.000\nThe end of an era.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nHow many years was Old Faithful with you?\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:31.000\nFifteen years.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nIt's got to be like fifteen, I think.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:34.000\nFourteen, something.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nLongest relationship I've ever had with anything.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:39.000\nWas Old Faithful in the menagerie at your old Hollywood place?\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nAbsolutely.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:41.000\nYeah.\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:45.000\nIt was the only one that survived because everything else didn't do anything.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:50.000\nFull mannequins.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nSorry, ladies.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nThere's nothing to you.\n\n21:54.000 --> 22:00.000\nIf you could restore and have Old Faithful back without the gnarled corn cob toe,\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:09.000\nor five real dolls, kind of like an endless supply of real dolls,\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:14.000\nwould you rather have the fleeting experience of the latex real doll\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:17.000\nor have Old Faithful back in its pristine form?\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:24.000\nI mean, come on, you're talking about like a $30,000 real doll value that could probably be,\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:25.000\nI don't know, that's crazy.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:26.000\nThat's a crazy question.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:30.000\nI'm sure I could, I would really have to think about it because...\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:33.000\nIt's a good question then.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:36.000\nEspecially if I could get the fully extended one back,\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:41.000\nbecause remember I had the fully extended one and then the bent one.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nWhat happened to the fully extended one?\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:47.000\nOver the years it just, you make sacrifices because girlfriends go,\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:48.000\nwhat are these?\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:52.000\nAnd you go, I rub them on my nipple.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.000\nI used to.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:55.000\nAre you going to again?\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nDo you want me to rub them on your nipple?\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:59.000\nNo.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:00.000\nDo you want to keep them?\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:06.000\nWell, that would be to imply the possibility of life after you.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:12.000\nBut maybe the smaller one that's...\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:15.000\nYou make up very much storage space and...\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:20.000\nHide that in your golf bag.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:25.000\nLet's bring out Rob Schrab.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:28.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:33.000\nComing over, baby, in and by you.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:38.000\nTurned out she's somebody else's touch.\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nCould be trouble, but could be fun.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:45.000\nCould be fun, baby.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:49.000\nEven if you're hot.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nOh, Rob has a mysterious bag.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nSnapchat.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nSnapchat.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:56.000\nHey, Rob, how you doing, man?\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:57.000\nI'm doing okay.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:58.000\nHow are you?\n\n23:58.000 --> 23:59.000\nI'm very well, thank you.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nBrought to you by Lassens.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nYou have a bag from Lassens?\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:06.000\nThe Mormon health food store in Los Feliz?\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:07.000\nYes.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:11.000\nThey keep very weird hours and there's 17 aisles that have chips in it.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nThere's no...\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:18.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:22.000\nI did not try to tee you up for that.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:26.000\nBut that's not what's in the bag.\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:27.000\nAm I right?\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:29.000\nI ran out of chips, so I'm here.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:30.000\nWhat's in the bag?\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\nIs this a reveal that we have to say for later?\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.000\nWhat's in the bag?\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:40.000\nI was cleaning up and I found all of the models from the G.I. Joe episode commercial.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:45.000\nI was going to give it to Steve Levy or Spencer and neither one of them are here.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:50.000\nSo I can't trust it with you because it'll be in an Uber somewhere.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nSo I'm going to have to take this home.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:55.000\nSo I took an Uber somewhere the other day.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:56.000\nOkay.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:57.000\nYesterday.\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:58.000\nYes.\n\n24:58.000 --> 24:59.000\nI took it to the Redberry Hotel.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:00.000\nRedberry.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nAh, the Redberry.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:07.000\nWhere the celebrities sleep.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nThe Redberry.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:13.000\nYou're already home.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:19.000\nAnd as we pulled up to the location, welcome to the Redberry.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:20.000\nThe guy...\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:23.000\nShould we reenact your arrival at the Redberry?\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:26.000\nI'd prefer to tell my story first.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nAnd then we'll reenact it.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:29.000\nAnd then we'll reenact it.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:34.000\nAnd then we'll get different periods in history and we'll do your Redberry story as that was\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:35.000\nset during a while.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:39.000\nAll I ask is to be able to just tell my story.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:48.000\nThe driver, as we pulled up to the Redberry, he started saying over and over again, pull\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:51.000\nup the Uber map.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:54.000\nPull up the Uber map and give to me.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:56.000\nI put in code.\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:57.000\nI put in code.\n\n25:57.000 --> 26:00.000\nHe's just repeating these phrases.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:08.000\nHe wanted me to give him my phone so he could put in a promotional code so as he put it,\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:10.000\nhe could give me a 20% discount.\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:13.000\nAnd I kept saying, I don't want.\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nI don't like this.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nTell me the code.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:18.000\n20% discount.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:19.000\nAnd I said, but I don't...\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:21.000\nYou can tell me the code.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nGive me the idol.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nThey can't just give me phone.\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:26.000\nI put in code.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:27.000\nGive me the idol.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:30.000\nI was like, I don't want to give you my phone.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nI don't know you.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:35.000\nIt's my phone.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nAnd he's like, 20%.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:48.000\nI said, I would like to pay you 40% extra to stop asking me for my personal property after\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:52.000\ngiving me a ride to a hotel.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nIt's close to a mugging.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:59.000\nIf I felt like I needed to give it to you, then you'd be mugging me.\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:03.000\nHis concern was that if he tells you the code, you're going to tell everybody at Harmontown\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:04.000\nwhat the code is?\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:07.000\nWell, I've heard stories and maybe somebody can...\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:09.000\nRumors.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:15.000\nI thought I heard a story from somebody that I couldn't recall.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:20.000\nBut I had this post-it note in my head about this whole give me your phone.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\nI'm going to put in a code thing.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:29.000\nI thought I remembered the story being they upgrade your ride to lux or looper-duper or\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:30.000\nsomething.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:33.000\nThey do some weird shit.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:38.000\nThere can't be a system in place where they need to touch your phone.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:39.000\nShit.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:43.000\nIf it's one thing, it's another.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nI tell you, man.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:46.000\nYeah, man.\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:47.000\nShit, man.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:52.000\nThose Uber drivers are really getting me down, too.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:54.000\nIt's oppressive.\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nSo oppressive.\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.000\nAh, man.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\nTrump.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:02.000\nThis shit.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:04.000\nStill going on.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nUber drivers.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nPromotional cozy.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\n24, man.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:11.000\nDoor-dash.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:12.000\nTinder.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:13.000\nSnapchat.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:14.000\nDoor-dash.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:15.000\nDoor-dash.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:18.000\nDoor-dash, jeans, all that stuff.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:19.000\nMan.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nYou don't use Snapchat, do you?\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:25.000\nI don't even know what that is.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:28.000\nI consider myself a snappist.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nYou brought me out.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:31.000\nWhy again?\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nBecause you brought, let's bring out Rob.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:34.000\nHey, how are you doing?\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:43.000\nLet me tell you something about my day yesterday.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:48.000\nWell, what is the proper way to use you in a show?\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nYou asked me to come.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:51.000\nWhat?\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:52.000\nYeah, you're very...\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:53.000\nThat's not my issue.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:54.000\nThe kids like you.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:55.000\nThe kids like you.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:56.000\nThen use me.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:57.000\nUse me properly.\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nThat's not my problem.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:08.000\nUsing you properly is bringing you out and letting you disrespect me and the show.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:16.000\nYou're talking like if you went to a rodeo and it's like, get that clown out of there.\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nHe's just rolling the ball up.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:19.000\nHe's just making it...\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:26.000\nI thought the goal was to...\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:31.000\nI came here to see a ball asleep.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:34.000\nI came here to see the pacification of a ball.\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:38.000\nThe ideal rodeo, I would show up and the ball would be laying there.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.000\nVanquished.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:44.000\nWho's this guy with the hair running around in barrels?\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:55.000\nYeah, I just thought you're a caustic, destructive, parasitic, symbiotic influence on the show\n\n29:55.000 --> 30:01.000\nthat the kids enjoy because they like to see me angry.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:06.000\nSo, talk about your day.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:13.000\nI got all this GI Jeff stuff here and that's what I got.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:18.000\nOh boy, that GI Jeff stuff.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:23.000\nWhat's going on with that?\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:26.000\nThis doesn't work when I do it.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:27.000\nWas that you doing him or?\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nYeah, I was trying to...\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nOkay.\n\n30:29.000 -->

--> 30:38.000\nThe Redbury.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nWelcome to the Redbury.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nOh, you want to do the scene?\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:43.000\nWelcome to the Redbury.\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:46.000\nLet me get that door for you, Mr. Harmon.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nLet me get that door for you.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nLet me open up that door.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nGot any baggage today?\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:55.000\nAll right, well, let me help you out here.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:56.000\nWatch your step.\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:57.000\nThere's a puddle.\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nAll right.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:02.000\nThe Uber driver says the Uber driver...\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nUber driver wants your phone.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:08.000\nIf I could have your phone so the Uber driver could get your...\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:12.000\nPlease, we want to get this vehicle out of the way.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:16.000\nIf you could just give me your phone so the Uber driver can punch...\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:20.000\nIt's a promotional code if you could give me your phone so the Uber driver...\n\n31:20.000

Oliva\n\n57:06.400 --> 57:10.080\nI hope it's not too forward your room. You checked in a little bit early\n\n57:10.080 --> 57:16.080\nWe're checking generally is three o'clock here. It's 1 30 p.m. Maybe we can interest you in a drink in our lounge\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:22.040\nYeah, this is not a this is not really an offer so much as a demand mr.

Here's your lemon drop, sir. Oh\n\n57:59.960 --> 58:01.960\nCarol come into my office\n\n58:03.160 --> 58:08.480\nOne second Carol Jesus Christ Carol are you using again?\n\n58:08.480 --> 58:15.560\nOh, what the fuck are you I just needed a bunch to get through this afternoon.

Thank you. Okay. I hope I come over to that basket. I don't find you've been doing that shit anymore. Yeah, that's what I thought\n\n59:49.680 --> 59:58.560\nOh, oh, oh, Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. We expected you on Thursday. I didn't know you didn't expect yourself. I follow the advice of Mr. Charles Schultz\n\n01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.440\nDraw peanuts\n\n01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:08.320\nBe surprised. Oh\n\n01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:14.040\nVery good, mr. Mayor. I'll leave you and mr. Leave it alone\n\n01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:21.000\nArrive early to check up on the subordinate. I think the meeting was the meeting wasn't it was implicit\n\n01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:25.040\nI'll uh your your your peanuts will be right out. Mm-hmm. Okay\n\n01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.040\nNew Steam\n\n01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.880\nMr. Reliever\n\n01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.880\nMay I speak to you in the corner booth?\n\n01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:45.680\nBut by all means miles taken off my shirt you'll have to confuse the Red very as of late\n\n01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:55.960\nit's gone downhill. I still believe in it, for privacy's sake. Have a seat. Mr. Aleeva\n\n01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.400\nwill be to the point where both busy men and the-\n\n01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.400\nWe are.\n\n01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:10.600\nGet those dollars out, gentlemen. Never thought I'd say it.\n\n01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:17.600\nPeril to the stage. She's got to get off that shit.\n\n01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:24.600\nI'm going to put a lit candle up my ass. It's Mondays at the Redberry.\n\n01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:36.040\nEvery Mondays. For the next 45 minutes, Lemon Drops are half off.\n\n01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:42.360\nMr. Aleeva, you are one of the best technical manual writers in video game history.\n\n01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.800\nThank you, thank you. High praise, high praise indeed.\n\n01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:51.960\nI run a city. I don't know video games. I don't know technical writing.\n\n01:01:51.960 --> 01:02:03.120\nI know craftsmanship and I know fascism. The latter is, I've got it handled.\n\n01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:11.800\nThe former sir, I have not seen the like of since looking into your eyes at the G4 summit.\n\n01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.680\nWhen you press that business card into my hand, now I've been crunching the numbers\n\n01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:24.240\nand I've been seeing the lights and I've got a proposition for you.\n\n01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:29.040\nWhat if the whole city were a video game?\n\n01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:36.040\nLike SimCity. If it's been done, then fuck it.\n\n01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:46.040\nPardon, Mr. Aleeva, Mr. Mayor. I asked for privacy over here.\n\n01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:51.440\nPlease don't leave. I have no way home.\n\n01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:55.600\nCarol and I would like to take Mr. Mayor and Mr. Aleeva up.\n\n01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:00.120\nWe'd like to take you upstairs for a moment. We have something rather important to discuss.\n\n01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.440\nNo problem, no problem.\n\n01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.000\nMr. Aleeva, Mr. Aleeva, what if what I proposed you is actually happening right now?\n\n01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.800\nWhat if this is all a simulation? Go.\n\n01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:21.280\nF217, F217, your directors were not to kill the mayor.\n\n01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.480\nMy orders were to accommodate him. He needed accoutrements.\n\n01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:35.280\nMy accoutrements include a bullet fired out of a gun.\n\n01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.480\nI reveal twists with every active.\n\n01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.920\nF217, F217, I'm going to give you the week off.\n\n01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:48.480\nI want you to go home and you're suspended from the RedBerry for a while.\n\n01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:53.280\nCarol, Carol, go get some rags. We have to clean up the mayor's corpse.\n\n01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:58.080\nI need a ride home. He goes right by where I live.\n\n01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.960\nIf you're sending him home, I mean, I could really use...\n\n01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.600\nOkay, Carol, yeah, you take Mr. Aleeva home?\n\n01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.280\nNo, the robot, he's driving by my...\n\n01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.600\nF217?\n\n01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.360\nThe only robot I'm pointing at.\n\n01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:16.480\nF217, get Carol the fuck out of here.\n\n01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:19.640\nOkay, I called you both an Uber.\n\n01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.160\nI live in a very peaceful neighborhood.\n\n01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:27.040\nIt is peaceful because there is zero crime.\n\n01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:31.400\nIt has zero crime because we have redefined crime.\n\n01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:35.960\nOnce per year, we eliminate rape and murder from our systems\n\n01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:39.440\nby engaging in it wholesale.\n\n01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.960\nWe enjoy it so much, we are peaceful.\n\n01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.720\nI am F127.\n\n01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:58.640\nYeah, the crazy thing about that improv is that shit could happen.\n\n01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.560\nYeah, it might still be happening.\n\n01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:07.040\nFred, it's still happening. This is all a simulation.\n\n01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.280\nI'll write about it.\n\n01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:13.040\nBut you'll be being written about while you do it.\n\n01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:18.920\nWhat you'll be writing is press X to control Fred.\n\n01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:22.960\nAnd then you'll look over your shoulder and there will be a giant Fred going...\n\n01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:28.640\nOr a Carol.\n\n01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:34.680\nThis is all in your manual, Fred.\n\n01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.640\nWell, man, is there anything you'd like to plug?\n\n01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:41.520\nDo you have a big trade paper back of video game instructions?\n\n01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.520\nI'd like to plug my band Super Bean.\n\n01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.520\nOh, yeah, yeah, you're in a band.\n\n01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.520\nSuper Bean, yeah, I play a band.\n\n01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.520\nSuper Bean?\n\n01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.520\nSuper Bean.\n\n01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.520\nBean.\n\n01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.520\nThere's human beans and there's Super Bean.\n\n01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.520\nOh, there's a bean, like a bean.\n\n01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.520\nYeah, that's correct.\n\n01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.520\nWrite it down.\n\n01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.520\nWrite it down.\n\n01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.520\nWrite it down.\n\n01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.520\nThere's a bean, there's a human bean.\n\n01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.520\nWhere are you guys playing next?\n\n01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.520\nWe're playing Cafe Neela.\n\n01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.520\nHopefully, Marks.\n\n01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.520\nHopefully.\n\n01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.520\nOkay, Mark.\n\n01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.520\nWhat are you opening with?\n\n01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.520\nWhat do...\n\n01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:09.520\nOh, you mean...\n\n01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.520\nAre you...\n\n01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.520\nOpening song?\n\n01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.520\nIt's a Super Bean theme.\n\n01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.520\nOh.\n\n01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.520\nLet's hear it for Super Bean.\n\n01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.520\nDa-da-da-da-da-da.\n\n01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.520\nWhat's your...\n\n01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:17.520\nWhat are you closing with?\n\n01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.520\nWhat is your closing song?\n\n01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.520\nDo you guys do any covers?\n\n01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.520\nDo you guys do any covers?\n\n01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.520\nThe Super Bean reprise.\n\n01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.520\nFor real?\n\n01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.520\nYou guys don't know any Fog Hat?\n\n01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:24.520\nWow.\n\n01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520\nI love Fog Hat.\n\n01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:35.520\nAll right, well, let's all graciously thank Fred for opening his life to us.\n\n01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.520\nThank you.\n\n01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.520\nThat's what it's like to be a technical writer.\n\n01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.520\nHopefully, there's a seat among your friends out there.\n\n01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.520\nI hope you don't have to go back and sit in the belfry.\n\n01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.520\nAll right.\n\n01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.520\nLet's go.\n\n01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520\nLet's go.\n\n01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.520\nLet's go.\n\n01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.520\nLet's go.\n\n01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.520\nLet's go.\n\n01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.520\nLet's go.\n\n01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.520\nLet's go.\n\n01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.520\nLet's go.\n\n01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.520\nLet's go.\n\n01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:57.520\nI hope you don't have to go back and sit in the belfry.\n\n01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:01.520\nFred, that music means leave.\n\n01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:04.960\nI was just wondering.\n\n01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:14.860\nI suppose there's probably another seat for him among his friends.\n\n01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.920\nThe word leave is in his name.\n\n01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:24.920\nHe had a bunch of friends who came, I was wondering if there was a seat among them for him, but there probably isn't.\n\n01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:28.920\nSo now I feel bad for our guests because then they have to go and sit in the closet for the rest of the show.\n\n01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.920\nWhen they have friends that come.\n\n01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.920\nHe had a big posse in the grandstand, there was a whole team of people.\n\n01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:34.920\nAnd they're all watching the show.\n\n01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:39.920\nAnd now they're friends offstage, and they're friends in a closet, and he can't sit in the show.\n\n01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.920\nI think about these things.\n\n01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:42.920\nShould we have them sit over there?\n\n01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:43.920\nOh yeah, he could sit at Spencer's.\n\n01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.920\nFred, Oliva, get back out here.\n\n01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.920\nFred?\n\n01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.920\nThat's perfect.\n\n01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:47.920\nFred, you're brilliant.\n\n01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:48.920\nWhere are you?\n\n01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.920\nFred, go sit by Spencer's seat.\n\n01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.920\nYeah, you can sit there.\n\n01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:51.920\nAnd now you have a seat in the show.\n\n01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.920\nI'll do something to help me.\n\n01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.920\nNo, yeah.\n\n01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.920\nHe's sick.\n\n01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.920\nThat's perfect.\n\n01:07:58.920 --> 01:07:59.920\nI don't have a 20-sided type.\n\n01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.920\nHe might actually make a good game master because he writes explanations.\n\n01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:03.920\nHe's the master of games.\n\n01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:04.920\nHe's literally a master of games.\n\n01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:05.920\nYeah.\n\n01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:11.920\nFred, do you ever play any role-playing games, like pen and paper kind of stuff?\n\n01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.920\nYes, I don't talk about that in public.\n\n01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:19.920\nWow, you're a real rich tapestry man.\n\n01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:28.920\nRob, we're in the room.\n\n01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.920\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.920\nHe's scrolling through something.\n\n01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.920\nIt looks like he's just picking a date.\n\n01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.920\nHe doesn't even look like he's doing anything.\n\n01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.920\nInstagram or Facebook?\n\n01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:43.920\nYeah, I told somebody I would give him a shout out and I'm trying to, I want to make sure\n\n01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:44.920\nthat I give him a shout out.\n\n01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.920\nAll right, shout out to the most memorable person in the world.\n\n01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:48.920\nOh, don't do that.\n\n01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.920\nYou're very important.\n\n01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.920\nI can't say it now.\n\n01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.920\nIt's serious, so.\n\n01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:59.920\nOh, are you seeing somebody?\n\n01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:00.920\nYes.\n\n01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.920\nAre you seeing me?\n\n01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:12.920\nRemember a couple weeks ago, you made me feel real bad for missing your birthday?\n\n01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:19.920\nYeah, I'm sorry.\n\n01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.920\nJeff, did you go to my birthday?\n\n01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:22.920\nI was out of town.\n\n01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.920\nHe was out of town.\n\n01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:29.920\nHe texted me, happy birthday though.\n\n01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.920\nI bought him a bath rubs.\n\n01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.920\nYou're leaving for Vancouver?\n\n01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:39.920\nWhat?\n\n01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:45.920\nBeginning of 2017.\n\n01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.920\nThat long?\n\n01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:47.920\nThat long?\n\n01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.920\nYeah, that's a long way away.\n\n01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.920\nYeah, that's a long way away.\n\n01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.920\nYou'll have another birthday between now and when you leave.\n\n01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.920\nYeah.\n\n01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:00.920\nSo we'll make it the best one ever.\n\n01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.920\nAll right.\n\n01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.920\nMoving on, we've got a lot of show to cover.\n\n01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:13.920\nOur next guest is very handsome and a debonair.\n\n01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.920\nHe always gets all dressed up.\n\n01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.920\nHe's gotten an extra sexy haircut lately.\n\n01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.920\nAnd he's always here.\n\n01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:25.920\nWe're very comforted by his face and his voice.\n\n01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.920\nAnd we wish him the best of luck.\n\n01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.920\nHe has some terrible news for us tonight.\n\n01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.920\nNo, he doesn't, I'm kidding.\n\n01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:33.920\nDeMorge Brown.\n\n01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.920\nDeMorge Brown.\n\n01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.920\nYeah.\n\n01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.920\nYeah.\n\n01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:40.920\nAin't shit some rich man, son.\n\n01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:45.920\nHe got nothing when Sunday.\n\n01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.920\nDon't talk to him.\n\n01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:50.920\nDon't want none, but he don't.\n\n01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:51.920\nWhat's up, DeMorge?\n\n01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:52.920\nNot much.\n\n01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.920\nCan I talk to you about physical fitness for a little bit?\n\n01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:56.920\nAll you want.\n\n01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:57.920\nHave you been working out?\n\n01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.920\nYes, so I always do, though.\n\n01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:01.920\nBut were you ever fat?\n\n01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:05.920\nOh, no.\n\n01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:06.920\nI was uncoordinated.\n\n01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.920\nYeah, I was like...\n\n01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.920\nIf you lifted up your shirt right now, would there be like a Peter Parker kind of like,\n\n01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:13.920\nlike six pack?\n\n01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:14.920\nNo, absolutely not.\n\n01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:15.920\nI've done this this year.\n\n01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.920\nJust a flat, it would just be a flat, delicious.\n\n01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.920\nHave you ever had abs, like six pack abs?\n\n01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:21.920\nYeah, most of the time.\n\n01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.920\nMost of the time?\n\n01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:23.920\nFor real?\n\n01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:29.920\nBut I played soccer like it's a kid, and if you, by the luck of the draw, because my\n\n01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:33.920\nbrain wasn't like those kids that are just naturally athletic, but I just love playing\n\n01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.920\nand stuff.\n\n01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:39.920\nSo you ascend pretty high, and at a certain level, you're getting basically pro trainers.\n\n01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:40.920\nYou're 11.\n\n01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.920\nThe guys that are training you are professional.\n\n01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.920\nSo you're getting like that kind of mental conditioning that gets you, you know, they\n\n01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.920\nbasically take the stuff that most people kind of look at running and go, I don't want\n\n01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.920\nto do that shit.\n\n01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.920\nSo can you give Dan some pointers, because Dan was saying the other day that you had a\n\n01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.920\npointer is exercise and get a trainer and stuff.\n\n01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.920\nBut it's also about like life, like mentally, how you do it.\n\n01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.920\nThey tricked us one time.\n\n01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.920\nThere was a level where they said everybody there at this camp wanted to be, wanted to\n\n01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.920\nstay on this team.\n\n01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:11.920\nBut the main requirement was that when they timed your runs, you had to come in under a\n\n01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.920\ncertain number of minutes on this one run.\n\n01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.920\nIt was be the longest run that you've done at this pace ever.\n\n01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.920\nAnd so for the first two weeks, they just let you stew with this fear that you were going\n\n01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.920\nto, you know, not make the grade and have to go home instead of spend the entire summer\n\n01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:26.920\nrunning around traveling places and having fun.\n\n01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:32.920\nAnd we did a run right before it where nobody felt good and everybody was dogging and everybody\n\n01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:33.920\nwas just, you know, dying.\n\n01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.920\nI was looking at people as we were running and going, what the fuck is wrong with me?\n\n01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.920\nBecause we just felt horrible.\n\n01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:44.920\nAnd at the end of the run, the guy was like, you guys think that that was a pretty bad\n\n01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:45.920\nrun.\n\n01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:48.920\nServices were, everything was, all the conditions were optimal.\n\n01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.920\nYou should have run better.\n\n01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.920\nBut what you guys don't know is that you ran not the four required time miles, but you\n\n01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:55.920\nran eight.\n\n01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:56.920\nWe just didn't tell you what you were doing.\n\n01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.920\nAnd so, and it's just like, but it was just physical fitness.\n\n01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:00.920\nIt's dishonest.\n\n01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:02.920\nThat's like the aerobics ladies.\n\n01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.920\nThey always go and 10, nine, eight and 11 and seven.\n\n01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.920\nThat's Rosie O'Donnell.\n\n01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:11.920\nIt was like that guy in the gym too was looking at his friend when they're lifting weights\n\n01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.920\nand he's going, come on, do one more, one more, one more.\n\n01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:15.920\nBut it's the same as a director.\n\n01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.920\nI do like that relationship.\n\n01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:21.920\nI talk to a lot of guys who like, they have personal trainers and then they have like these\n\n01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.920\nkind of like, you know, they're pretty important relationships.\n\n01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:31.920\nI talk, I have, I have one friend who's gay and who, I swear to God, and he has a personal\n\n01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:37.920\ntrainer and like, and like the guy is straight and like the trainer straight and like, but\n\n01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:41.920\nhe's like hot and he's always like, you know, when you're a trainer, you're like, you're\n\n01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:47.920\nservicing like all, you're hitting all these buttons emotionally, you know, you're like,\n\n01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:51.920\nyou're like saying to this guy, everything that a guy would want to hear if he would,\n\n01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:54.920\nif he wanted to be romantically involved with a guy, you're saying, you're like the wind\n\n01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:58.920\nbeneath that guy's wings, you're going like, you're the best, you're the fucking best,\n\n01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:03.920\nyou know, and it's, it's really weird because, and it's like, because there's a whole, it's\n\n01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:10.920\nLA and so a lot of these trainers are straight and they're actors and they want to work in\n\n01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.920\nthe industry and then they're like training.\n\n01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.920\nPlush comes to shove.\n\n01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:21.920\nLike a lot of like a very powerful gay men getting physically trained by guys that they\n\n01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:25.920\nknow are straight and it's like, it's very interesting to just hear about these things.\n\n01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:31.920\nI have a trainer I go to very infrequently and he's really, really funny.\n\n01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.920\nHe's a black guy and he calls me the N word constantly.\n\n01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:40.920\nThat would go, I would pay a million dollars for that. Okay, if that, if that can be a part of\n\n01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.920\nexercise, I didn't know that.\n\n01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:45.920\nAnd then are you fucking kidding me?\n\n01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:48.920\nHe's like, he keeps calling everybody the N word.\n\n01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.920\nHe calls me the N word the most.\n\n01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.920\nAnd then, and probably makes you the happiest the other day.\n\n01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.920\nWait, this guy's your trainer?\n\n01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:57.920\nHe's great.\n\n01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:58.920\nWait, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.\n\n01:14:58.920 --> 01:14:59.920\nOh, you got to do it.\n\n01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:04.920\nIs he going to just say that over and put lifting as a, come on, and he calls me that?\n\n01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.920\nHe also recommends that you come to work out a little high.\n\n01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.920\nHe wants you to smoke a little bit of weed before you.\n\n01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.920\nAnd a little late because he wants all the stereotypes.\n\n01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:14.920\nHe's like, he wants to like, like, like lean into him.\n\n01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.920\nOkay, so now you're going too far.\n\n01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:17.920\nAll right, all right.\n\n01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.920\nBut when it's leg day, I have a little skinny, little skinny chicken legs.\n\n01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.920\nAnd so we do legs and I can't walk.\n\n01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.920\nWe do a dance called the wonky honky.\n\n01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:30.920\nAnd we, we do the wonky honky leg.\n\n01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:35.920\nWell, see, I don't want the, the whole like, oh, come on, white boy, you're pretty good\n\n01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.920\nfor a white boy.\n\n01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920\nI want, I want to be called.\n\n01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.920\nHe calls you, he calls you nigger the whole time.\n\n01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.920\nDon't, you don't have to say it.\n\n01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:42.920\nIt's hilarious.\n\n01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:43.920\nIt was with an A, right?\n\n01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:50.920\nBut I want to be, I was like, I want to like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like DMX.\n\n01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:52.920\nI want DMX to yell at me.\n\n01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:53.920\nYeah.\n\n01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.920\nDo it number one, do it number two, do it number three, get it.\n\n01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.920\nNo, it'd be amazing.\n\n01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.920\nBecause I wouldn't, it wouldn't feel fraudulent.\n\n01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.920\nIt would feel like empowerment to me.\n\n01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:04.920\nI know.\n\n01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.920\nBecause he'd be like, fuck, you hear it, fucking do it.\n\n01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.920\nAs much as we're laughing because he's so, we've, we've, I've known this guy forever.\n\n01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:10.920\nWe're good friends.\n\n01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:11.920\nHe's fucking hilarious.\n\n01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:15.920\nAlso, like, you will want to barf in the middle of it because it's like really hard going.\n\n01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:18.920\nBut like, he keeps it fun and buoyant and it's always different.\n\n01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:19.920\nIt's very good stuff.\n\n01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.920\nOh man.\n\n01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.920\nI mean, I'm picturing, I'm picturing him as DMX.\n\n01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.920\nI don't know.\n\n01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.920\nIt says it's like, it's just the idea of the, like, the validation that you would be, like,\n\n01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.920\nlike, like, like, he would, he would be like, come on, fuck him.\n\n01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:32.920\nYeah.\n\n01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.920\nYeah.\n\n01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:34.920\nYeah.\n\n01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:38.920\nOne of the, one of the, we're at a new gym now because like, it's like he moved to a different\n\n01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:39.920\ngym.\n\n01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:40.920\nSo I was the first time I went there.\n\n01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:43.920\nThere's this other trainer who looks like, like Cypress Hill.\n\n01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:46.920\nLike he's like an Irish guy with a big, you know, like red beard.\n\n01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:50.920\nAnd he walks up and he, he walks into the field and he goes, Phil, stop looking at the white\n\n01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.920\nwomen.\n\n01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:52.920\nThis is a joke.\n\n01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:55.920\nAnd he goes, he goes, oh man, you guys are all races.\n\n01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:59.920\nYou've been calling everybody the N-word the entire time.\n\n01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:03.920\nIt's, it's, everybody is just hurling fake racism at each other the whole time.\n\n01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:04.920\nIt's really good.\n\n01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:05.920\nI just want the N-word.\n\n01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:06.920\nI don't want any of this.\n\n01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.920\nI don't want any of this stuff.\n\n01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.920\nI don't want to be a party to anything.\n\n01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:13.920\nI want to be called that word sincerely.\n\n01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:14.920\nLike, like, like, like.\n\n01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:15.920\nOh, he's your man.\n\n01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:16.920\nHe's your man.\n\n01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:20.920\nIt's like, like, remember Rob, like, remember when we were kids in Milwaukee?\n\n01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.920\nRob, Rob's, but Rob's been bald since the seventies.\n\n01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:26.920\nNineteen.\n\n01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:27.920\nNineteen.\n\n01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.920\nAnd, and, and before Bruce Willis was in Pulp Fiction, it was like not, it was, you know,\n\n01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.920\nand before Patrick Stewart was the captain of the enterprise.\n\n01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:40.920\nIt's like, like, you know, and when Rob was 22, it was like, you know, there wasn't a lot\n\n01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:45.920\nof pride involved in Milwaukee with, with the losing of the hair.\n\n01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:49.920\nI was, I was, I was friends with him when he was going through like a weird phase where\n\n01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.920\nit was like, it was hitting critical mass.\n\n01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:56.920\nAnd he was like, he had a, he had a girlfriend who like kind of made it clear that, you know,\n\n01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:59.920\nwouldn't be maybe a bad idea for him to go get a toupee.\n\n01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.920\nAnd like, he, he went, he went through the whole motion of that.\n\n01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.920\nLike, like, like, you know, and, and, but, but, and he can, he can talk about that in\n\n01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:09.920\na second.\n\n01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.920\nBut the, but the, but the thing that I remember you being so excited about, because there was\n\n01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:17.920\nthat day, I think it was like, like when Pulp Fiction was like, he came out.\n\n01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:21.920\nHe was like, all of a sudden, like balding men in cinema just started like,\n\n01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:22.920\nIt's fucking hot.\n\n01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:23.920\nInstead of like,\n\n01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:24.920\nSo hot.\n\n01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.920\nIt went from Hudson Hawk, where it was like CG hair.\n\n01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:31.920\nAnd then it was like Pulp Fiction, where if you, even if you had the fucking like, like,\n\n01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.920\nlike, like receding hair, you just fucking shave it off.\n\n01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:35.920\nLike, why not?\n\n01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:36.920\nIt's more virile than that.\n\n01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.920\nAnd so all of a sudden, and then like, Rob got all excited and like came in, I can't\n\n01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:44.920\nremember where we were, but you were like, I was driving down far well.\n\n01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:50.920\nAnd, and, and, and it was, I was at a stoplight and this, and this big like, like, like, like,\n\n01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:54.920\nscary looking black guy, like, like muscles and like, like, like it was fucking, he looked\n\n01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:58.920\nlike, like, like, like not a guy that would like hang out with me.\n\n01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.920\nAnd he's like yelling something at the car.\n\n01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:02.920\nAnd I'm like, Oh God, now what?\n\n01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:06.920\nAnd I rolled down the windows like, like, what, what, what are you yelling at me?\n\n01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:13.920\nAnd the guy said, I'm with you, brother, because he had shaved his head too.\n\n01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:17.920\nThat's awesome.\n\n01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.920\nAnd he, and he ran in sharing the story because it's like, it's a visceral thing.\n\n01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:22.920\nYeah.\n\n01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:28.920\nAttached to, attached to every little, little ugly, terrible, like, like racist thing.\n\n01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:31.920\nIt's all this, and to tie it all into porn.\n\n01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:35.920\nLook how fucking, look how fucking unracistly racist porn is.\n\n01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:39.920\nLike, like, like, like, that's so crazy that like in an industry that's just like has no\n\n01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:45.920\ntact, no accountability, nothing at all, you'd expect it to be a fetid wasteland of\n\n01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.920\nfucking horrible racist shit.\n\n01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:50.920\nThe internet in general is, you can go to websites that are just like, oh, these are\n\n01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.920\nhorrible charts.\n\n01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.920\nAnd here's a presidential candidate just retweeting them.\n\n01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:59.920\nLike, but porn itself is just like, yeah, put that big black dick and here's a big,\n\n01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:05.920\nbut it's like, it's not like, it doesn't, it doesn't like, it doesn't, it, it, it, it,\n\n01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:10.920\nit, it, it, it, it like treats, it treats race as if it's like hair color or height\n\n01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:13.920\nor like, it's like, it's like, oh, what are you into?\n\n01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:14.920\nYou know?\n\n01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:17.920\nAnd so it's like, it's all equivalent.\n\n01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:21.920\nWho's yelling, yeah, put that big black dick in the room.\n\n01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:22.920\nIt's like an announcement.\n\n01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:23.920\nProbably Nick Manning.\n\n01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.920\nBig black dick!\n\n01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.920\nNo, I was trying to think of an example.\n\n01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:34.920\nI'm always like, I always feel like as a child of the 70s, whenever I see like interracial\n\n01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:38.920\nthis or anything like that, I always like brace myself for something that's going to\n\n01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.920\nlike, make me uncomfortable.\n\n01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:45.920\nLike, like even in the privacy of my own bed, like, like with my laptop open, I'm like\n\n01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:49.920\nstill going like, don't, don't, don't make this awkward for me.\n\n01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:54.920\nLike, like, like, but, but nine times out of ten, it's simply just a celebration of\n\n01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.920\nlike, like, like whatever.\n\n01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:59.920\nIt's like, like, like people go to dark places when they're, that's a pun.\n\n01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:00.920\nThe.\n\n01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:01.920\nDidn't have to be.\n\n01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:02.920\nDidn't have to be.\n\n01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.920\nDidn't have to be.\n\n01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.920\nPeople, people, people, people are just like fulfilling themselves.\n\n01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.920\nAnd it's like, like, like, like, it's like, there's a, there's a line passage.\n\n01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:15.920\nLike, like, like things that are like absolutely inappropriate that are like shielding terrible,\n\n01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:18.920\nterrible, hateful feelings that you're being dishonest about.\n\n01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:22.920\nAnd then you go to these crevices where people go to like just pleasure themselves.\n\n01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:28.920\nThese, these public toilets that we consider so non-sacred, but it's, it's remarkable\n\n01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:36.920\nto me and notable to me that you don't see like a lot of what you would qualify as racism\n\n01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:41.920\nin these ridiculous circuses, although you see acknowledgment of race.\n\n01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:42.920\nWell, okay.\n\n01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.920\nSo counterpoint.\n\n01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:49.920\nFirst of all, that stuff doesn't actually, it's not real.\n\n01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:50.920\nSo it's in there.\n\n01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:54.920\nSo you have people who are in, people who are actively racist, indulging their sort of\n\n01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.920\nisolated fantasies and that stuff.\n\n01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:02.920\nI mean, it's that, the fact that there's this category is exist because we like, well,\n\n01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:07.920\nwell, let's be really specific though, because like, like, like, like, like, wouldn't you\n\n01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.920\nexpect to see like, I don't know.\n\n01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:13.920\nWell, now I've got, if I riff an example, I'm just going to like fucking like hit all,\n\n01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:14.920\nlike hit all the notes.\n\n01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:21.920\nThere's, there's, there's, uh, uh, Brazzers, which is basically just world famous.\n\n01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:26.920\nI mean, but it's a, but it's a, it's a touchstone.\n\n01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:30.920\nIt's, it's, it's a comedic touchstone because it's just, it literally is just sanctioned\n\n01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:34.920\nviolence against whoever is the, whether it's women, usually it's women.\n\n01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:36.920\nUh, if it's black women, then it's black women.\n\n01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:40.920\nAnd then you double by a power of two, the amount of horseshit that you're like putting\n\n01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:46.920\ninto, uh, into, into this, into this, this narrative, um, that is, that is porn.\n\n01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:51.920\nAnd it's, and it's it because you are, there's a task agreement that because you're clicking\n\n01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:55.920\ninto it and you're doing it or you're watching it or you've bought it or you're, it's being\n\n01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.920\nshown somewhere and you're watching it in a community of people.\n\n01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:58.920\nThat's okay.\n\n01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.920\nSo okay, that exists on the outside of it.\n\n01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:04.920\nIf you look at it and do an inventory of what's going on, it's horrifying.\n\n01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:08.920\nAnd it's just that they contributes often to, well, what's horrifying.\n\n01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.920\nI just want, I want to get more specific.\n\n01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:15.920\nLike, like, you're very, you're, you, like, like, like, like, can we just like trade\n\n01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:20.920\nlike, like things that are like, you know what, this is part of the problem, not part\n\n01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:21.920\nof the solution.\n\n01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.920\nThis is, uh, ridiculous, but not actually causing any part of the problem.\n\n01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:31.920\nAnd then is there something that's like actively maybe making the world a better place while\n\n01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:36.920\nstill being porn, which, which would be a new category of porn in any respect.\n\n01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:40.920\nI mean, everything is like, and first of all, inherently misogynist.\n\n01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:49.920\nYeah, I just don't think that to isolate it as a Disneyland Paris where this kind of stuff\n\n01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:55.920\nhappens where things are a little bit correct, but, uh, lovely things happen, you know.\n\n01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:56.920\nRight.\n\n01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.920\nWait, no, I think you might have misunderstood me.\n\n01:23:58.920 --> 01:23:59.920\nOkay.\n\n01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:03.920\nI'm saying like in a world where you can, where Donald Trump is like pulling fucking charts\n\n01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:07.920\nthat are about, there's like, there's a difference between genuine racism and then\n\n01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:14.920\nthis just dumb, like 90 IQ playfulness of like, if you're like, like, we keep thinking that\n\n01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:18.920\nlike, like, like first of all, like ignorance does lead to hatred because if you're ignorant,\n\n01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:24.920\nyou can be like revved up by people who are willing to take advantage of you.\n\n01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:31.920\nThe people who aren't actively invested in your hatred are, for instance, pornographers.\n\n01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:40.920\nThey're invested in your animalistic like release and your indulgence of like crazy taboo fantasies.\n\n01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:47.920\nSo I think it's very notable psychologically that in politics, you will hear more genuinely\n\n01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:55.920\nproblematically racist things put forward in ways that actually last and lead to policies\n\n01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:01.920\nand things like that. When if you, if you, if you were to go into the porn world where\n\n01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:05.920\nsupposedly everyone's a fucking idiot and therefore they should be the most racist people\n\n01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:10.920\nin the world, but no, because they're not incentivized by hatred, they're, they may be\n\n01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:11.920\ntotally inappropriate.\n\n01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:15.920\nThey're not the most stylistically like savvy people in the world.\n\n01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:18.920\nSo you have just people going like, hey, click here.\n\n01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.920\nIf you want to watch a white woman take two giant big black cocks because you know how\n\n01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.920\nblack those fucking big cocks are.\n\n01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:33.920\nLike it's not like, it's, it's, it's, if you're, if you're, if you're like all of those, all\n\n01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.920\nof these, I mean the only difference between like that example and the other example is\n\n01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:45.920\nthat those guys at the end of their end game is policy, public policy, legislation and porn\n\n01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:49.920\npeople aren't really, their end game isn't that.\n\n01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:52.920\nI don't know what they're doing either, but I'm fucking locked into you.\n\n01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:54.920\nAll of these words, but there are all of these.\n\n01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.920\nAnd your big black mind.\n\n01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.920\nTake it down.\n\n01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:05.920\nIt's fucking stretching my little white racist hole out.\n\n01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:10.920\nYou'd be shocked what you're capable of.\n\n01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:16.920\nThere are, but these are all sort of microcosms and each one of those has at its core a resonator\n\n01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.920\nand that resonator hits all of these points.\n\n01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:22.920\nSo all the things you're saying that the politicians doing that Trump is doing also exist\n\n01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:25.920\nand are in play in the world of porn.\n\n01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:33.920\nSo yes, some of these things and their abstracted way draw people who are going to see this\n\n01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.920\nand somehow their world is going to open a little bit or whatever.\n\n01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:42.920\nBut again, within that whole idea that of ignorance, there is, there is selective,\n\n01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:45.920\nthere is this ignorance where somebody is ignorant and they are not in control of the fact that\n\n01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.920\nthey don't know anything, they don't know it.\n\n01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.920\nThat's that.\n\n01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:55.920\nThen there is, there is this sort of selected ignorance where people choose to stay ignorant\n\n01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:01.920\nbecause they know that outside of that fence more information comes that may change the way they are\n\n01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.920\nor that shakes them from their sort of their pedestal.\n\n01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.920\nAnd a lot of what you see in porn is that.\n\n01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.920\nIt's just fence building to keep people in a world that allows them to do whatever.\n\n01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:16.920\nAnd you know, it's a zero sum game in the sense that if that person never ventures out of their house\n\n01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:20.920\nthen we don't know what ill will they're harboring.\n\n01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:26.920\nBut some of those people and some factor in a one to ten sample, some of those two people do enter out.\n\n01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:31.920\nAnd in that sample, there are some people who do things that are not great.\n\n01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:35.920\nAnd of that, some of those things become public and then we on the outside look at those people and go,\n\n01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:40.920\nwell, how do we get to this? How do we come to this place? How did this person get here?\n\n01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:44.920\nSo I think that all of it's in play and all of these are, even in music, it's the same stuff.\n\n01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:48.920\nAnd we can have the same kinds of debates about people using the n-word and rap\n\n01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:50.920\nand people who, you know, with that.\n\n01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:55.920\nIn all manners of entertainment, we have always used that to express like from the time when it was like,\n\n01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:58.920\nokay, Rob, don't you fucking move.\n\n01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:01.920\nOh, he's putting his phone away. Okay. I thought he was leaving again.\n\n01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.920\nMy phone away.\n\n01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:13.920\nWell, because entertainment is visceral and it's like, yeah, if you take racism into the\n\n01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:18.920\nworld of media, you're probably not going to get disabused of it within media.\n\n01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.920\nThat's what we tend to do wrong.\n\n01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.920\nAnd then we applaud things that we go like, you know what, this is so good.\n\n01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:28.920\nIt might like a Norman Lear sitcom or something like that.\n\n01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:32.920\nYou go like, this is so good that you could come into it racist and leave,\n\n01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:37.920\npossibly somehow having been tricked into your mind opening a little bit.\n\n01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:44.920\nI'm not, when we're holding the yardstick of whether or not it's doing good or bad\n\n01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:50.920\nor that it's like, I think we're probably on the same page and looking at it.\n\n01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:55.920\nLike the thing that I'm saying is sort of remarkable is just that it's like,\n\n01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.920\nokay, so compare it to religion.\n\n01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.920\nLike, why would there be more racism, more prevalent in religion?\n\n01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:06.920\nAnd I know what you're talking about is what you, like, okay, racism is the fences\n\n01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:07.920\nthat you're talking about.\n\n01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.920\nSo any place where you're conscious of race, then you're not helping, right?\n\n01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:11.920\nThat's racism.\n\n01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:12.920\nThat's sexism.\n\n01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:18.920\nThat's bias of learned, like a chosen bias, I would say, selected bias.\n\n01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:19.920\nPeople who are knowingly.\n\n01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:26.920\nSo like in all porn, you're always watching a woman get like fucked by a guy.\n\n01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:27.920\nNot in all porn.\n\n01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:30.920\nNo, sometimes just Scooby-Doo.\n\n01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:38.920\nI'm saying like, for women, women have been dealing with this forever.\n\n01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:49.920\nIt's like pornography tends to involve, it's a difficult highway cone set to navigate taking\n\n01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:51.920\nyour feminism into pornography.\n\n01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:55.920\nThere's a lot of dumb people making a lot of stuff and etc.\n\n01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:02.920\nAnd so the outer edges of how you define it and the people who have a sense of pushing\n\n01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:07.920\nborders of sexuality and how it's accepted are the ones who are trying to sort of, who\n\n01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:12.920\nhave always tried to sort of make it a thing so that you leave it as a choice for the other\n\n01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:15.920\nperson to decide what it is they want to be comfortable with.\n\n01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:19.920\nBut you also try to take things that people are uncomfortable with and make them understand\n\n01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.920\nthat there are other sensibilities out there.\n\n01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:25.920\nBut it gets like all things, it gets corrupted and it gets changed by the money makers.\n\n01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.920\nYou look at the things that are, for example, I don't know if this will make any sense,\n\n01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:37.920\nbut there was a time when Walmart or a chain of some sort selected to remove any Rush album\n\n01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:43.920\nwith the Starman symbol on it because he was nude and that was perceived to be sexual and\n\n01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:47.920\ntrying to force polygram or mercury to take that symbol off of the Rush album covers.\n\n01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.920\nI sure it just wasn't because Rush sucks.\n\n01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:51.920\nAll right, let's not get distracted.\n\n01:30:51.920 --> 01:31:01.920\nAll right, well, let me, I think after the show, DeMorge, after the show.\n\n01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:05.920\nEvery time we have a conversation of any gravity, I perceive myself as just dragging you back\n\n01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:11.920\ninto a pettiness, but thought of another, just another example, which is that, okay,\n\n01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:18.920\non Twitter we have an African American president who I noted at one point, like, he can't tweet\n\n01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:20.920\nhis team can't tweet.\n\n01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:22.920\nHealth care is good.\n\n01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:23.920\nGoing good.\n\n01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.920\nGotta keep that Guantanamo going.\n\n01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:26.920\nEverybody, I'm the president.\n\n01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:27.920\nHe makes a tweet.\n\n01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:32.920\nIf you look through the replies invariably, at least one use of the end word.\n\n01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:35.920\nIf Flotus' Twitter is worse.\n\n01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:39.920\nWell, let me just finish my little thing.\n\n01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:47.920\nSo, isn't it a little crazy that if you go to Pornhub Premium, now available for gift\n\n01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:48.920\nprices.\n\n01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:51.920\nBut for how long?\n\n01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:55.920\nAnd they do have, like Pornhuts have comment sections, and they have titles, and they\n\n01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:58.920\nhave editors, and they have directors, and they have writers, and they have actors.\n\n01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:03.920\nYou don't, I don't, you, that seething hatred.\n\n01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:07.920\nMaybe it's because, like, if you're going, if you're looking at porn, you're usually\n\n01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.920\ndoing it by yourself in the privacy of your own home, and there's no agenda to it.\n\n01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:14.920\nWell, maybe it's because when you're looking at porn, you already feel like you're doing\n\n01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:18.920\nsomething wrong, therefore you're actually in an honest zone.\n\n01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:24.920\nSo, you've actually compartmentalized yourself, and it's like the ambition to be a good person\n\n01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:32.920\nmay be, like, hugely responsible, like, for so many things that we do wrong to each other.\n\n01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:36.920\nI also think with the president's side, a lot of that stuff, you leave up because you\n\n01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:39.920\nwant the world to see sort of what is out there.\n\n01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:40.920\nYou don't want to pretend it.\n\n01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:45.920\nI don't follow her, but you're saying that Flotus, that she, well, but that's not, but\n\n01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:50.920\nI mean, it's not just her, because, I mean, Rosa M. Barr gets annihilated.\n\n01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.920\nI think we're straight from the point, though.\n\n01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:56.920\nI don't think porn sites cull their comment sections for racism.\n\n01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:01.920\nI'm just saying, I hadn't thought about the fact that, you know, Mr. Obama's getting nailed\n\n01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:03.920\nevery time she opens her mouth on Twitter, of course.\n\n01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:06.920\nAbout anything, and some of it, and much of it isn't racist.\n\n01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:08.920\nIt's just weird, sexist stuff.\n\n01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.920\nOh, it's terrible.\n\n01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.920\nBut you leave it up.\n\n01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:19.920\nI mean, you look at, like, so, okay, when Obama was first elected president, there's a song\n\n01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:25.920\ncalled, I forget what it's called, it's a country song by...\n\n01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:27.920\nShoot, I can't think of any guys there.\n\n01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:28.920\nWilliams Jr.?\n\n01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:29.920\nNo, sir.\n\n01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:30.920\nIt's a good guess.\n\n01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:33.920\nBut it's called, I think it's called a monkey president or something like that.\n\n01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:34.920\nThey came out now.\n\n01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:35.920\nHere's the trick.\n\n01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.920\nHear me out.\n\n01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:37.920\nHear me out.\n\n01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:40.920\nIt's a legit country song.\n\n01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.920\nIt is, it's not Roy A. Cuff.\n\n01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.920\nIt's somebody like, and I'm not, I don't want to attach any names to this, but it's somebody...\n\n01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:46.920\nIt's like Toby Keith.\n\n01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:47.920\nIs it Toby Keith?\n\n01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:48.920\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:50.920\nYour way, this is old school.\n\n01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:53.920\nThis is in the highwayman era.\n\n01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:57.920\nBut when you look at the song, and people were great, people were just throwing the song out there,\n\n01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:00.920\nposting it everywhere, et cetera, et cetera, and people were appalled in this day and time.\n\n01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:02.920\nPeople would write a song like this, et cetera.\n\n01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:05.920\nThe song is from 1975 or 1906, it turns out.\n\n01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:07.920\nAnd it was written about Jimmy Carter.\n\n01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:10.920\nBut you have people who are so anxious to do something, and they go,\n\n01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.920\nremember that song from a long time ago?\n\n01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:16.920\nAnd then they pull it out, digitize it, send it out, and just start this chain that goes on.\n\n01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:17.920\nBecause that's what's out there.\n\n01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:18.920\nThey love it.\n\n01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.920\nYou know, you go into that wormhole and you see it.\n\n01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:25.920\nAnd there was a time on Myspace where I stumbled onto a clan site.\n\n01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.920\nLike a guy's page, it just was in the clan.\n\n01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:28.920\nThat was it.\n\n01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:33.920\nAnd the graphic design, when I went through his friends, it occurred to me suddenly that\n\n01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:39.920\nthe clan had their own sort of sub, people who were just their friends\n\n01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:41.920\nwho market their graphic design skills out to them.\n\n01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:43.920\nAnd they're clan-specific.\n\n01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:47.920\nJust glittering stars and horses with hoods.\n\n01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:49.920\nGifts, gifs, whatever.\n\n01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.920\nJust riding around the back of your biode.\n\n01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.920\nRiding in the background.\n\n01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:55.920\nI mean, this stuff exists out there.\n\n01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:56.920\nAnd what do you do?\n\n01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:57.920\nYou don't wipe it away.\n\n01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:00.920\nOne of the benefits of the world that we live in now is that we see all this,\n\n01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:04.920\nso that it's not just whispered about and it's not just shadows sort of drifting around in the corners.\n\n01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.920\nDo you feel that's a good thing?\n\n01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:08.920\nI mean, it's a thing.\n\n01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:11.920\nNo, it could be seen.\n\n01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:15.920\nYeah, and I think that there's enough stuff going on in the world right now that we don't have time to be...\n\n01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:16.920\nSorry.\n\n01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:23.920\nThe Rule 34 thing, you think that there's any porn where it's guys dressed up as KKK's fucking Scooby-Doo's?\n\n01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:25.920\nWell, I was going to say...\n\n01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:27.920\nIf not now, there will be tomorrow.\n\n01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:31.920\nThere is not a dearth of KKK... I've stumbled onto KKK sites.\n\n01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.920\nI've stumbled onto cartoons of like...\n\n01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.920\nStumbled?\n\n01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:35.920\nTerrible...\n\n01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:39.920\nFair enough.\n\n01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:41.920\nFair enough.\n\n01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:48.920\nMight as well stay here.\n\n01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:53.920\nAnd I do, because I'm like, holy fuck.\n\n01:35:53.920 --> 01:36:02.920\nAnd I don't stumble into what I would call racist porn.\n\n01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:05.920\nI stumble into what I would call constantly a...\n\n01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:08.920\nI guess what maybe you and I would agree is like a...\n\n01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:12.920\nWhat do you call it?\n\n01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:14.920\nA perpetuation of fences in porn.\n\n01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.920\nI mean, like the idea...\n\n01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:21.920\nIf you want to know that black guys have huge dicks\n\n01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.920\nand then all this stuff, like you're not going to be...\n\n01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:27.920\nThere's not a lot of activity going on in porn that's supposed to...\n\n01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:29.920\nThat's designed to like below...\n\n01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:31.920\nLike, like, sophisticate you.\n\n01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:36.920\nBut what you don't see is like videos where it's like...\n\n01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:42.920\nWhere people are being dehumanized actively in the narrative.\n\n01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:43.920\nExcept the website.\n\n01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:44.920\nI'm sorry, what?\n\n01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:45.920\nWhere is it?\n\n01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:50.920\nI don't see like white guys saying to black guys in porn\n\n01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:55.920\nlike, hey, you're not a human being, so you should fuck this person.\n\n01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:56.920\nLike it's not...\n\n01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:58.920\nI don't see like racist shit.\n\n01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:06.920\nI see consciousness of race and horrible affirmation of like off the top stereotypes\n\n01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:08.920\nbecause they're not brave people.\n\n01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:10.920\nI gotta get porn to a premium then.\n\n01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:11.920\nWhat are you watching?\n\n01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:17.920\nCan you at least just say, just tell me a piece of porn that you watched that was like...\n\n01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:20.920\nI don't even... I just know like, okay, let's say...\n\n01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:21.920\nWhere you're like, this is fucked up.\n\n01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:25.920\nI'm walking away from this fucking like, this is...\n\n01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:26.920\nNo, I don't...\n\n01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:27.920\nI think it's...\n\n01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:32.920\nThe big thing is generally like the abuse of the women and it's like...\n\n01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:34.920\nJeff, please put a sock in it.\n\n01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.920\nI asked him a question.\n\n01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:38.920\nI was saying like, I don't think...\n\n01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:42.920\nWhat you're saying is like, if you want to go into a site and watch little...\n\n01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:45.920\nI think if you look hard enough, you'll find it.\n\n01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:47.920\nDid you look hard enough?\n\n01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:48.920\nNo.\n\n01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:49.920\nOkay.\n\n01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:50.920\nIt just showed up.\n\n01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:51.920\nAll right.\n\n01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:52.920\nI mean, that's what I'm saying.\n\n01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:53.920\nWhat did you see?\n\n01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:54.920\nIt just showed up.\n\n01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:55.920\nWhat did you see that just showed up?\n\n01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:56.920\nEverything you just described.\n\n01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:57.920\nWhat?\n\n01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.920\nJust words, weird, shaming.\n\n01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:00.920\nYeah.\n\n01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:01.920\nYou saw...\n\n01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:03.920\nYou actually saw like, so like actual...\n\n01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:04.920\nYeah, man.\n\n01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:08.920\nLike status, like where they're low status, like where the black protagonist is low status.\n\n01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:09.920\nIt's...\n\n01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:10.920\nYes.\n\n01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:11.920\nAbsolutely.\n\n01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:12.920\nI mean, it's right there.\n\n01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:13.920\nIt's there.\n\n01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:14.920\nIt's even there.\n\n01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:15.920\nIf you're looking at...\n\n01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:19.920\nIf you're looking at something else and it's linked to porn related stuff,\n\n01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.920\nit's in the advertising on the side because it's...\n\n01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:24.920\nBecause that world is full of people who just...\n\n01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:28.920\nWho in that zone, it's catch, just catch can.\n\n01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:31.920\nIf you don't want to see it, you're not going to hit click and go through that door.\n\n01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:32.920\nIf you want to see it, you'll go through the door.\n\n01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:36.920\nWhether whatever your intentions are, if you're curious and you just want to do field recordings\n\n01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:38.920\nin your mind of what's out there, you'll go through there.\n\n01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.920\nIf that's what you need, then you'll go through there.\n\n01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:41.920\nRight.\n\n01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:42.920\nWhatever that stuff is.\n\n01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:43.920\nI mean, that...\n\n01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:44.920\nProbably a majority of it is it's probably...\n\n01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:52.920\nIt's an extension of the misogyny because it's the gang bang, kind of like, oh, this woman...\n\n01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:54.920\nIt's like where the...\n\n01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:59.920\nIt's like, oh, no, the black guys are going to come in and they're being...\n\n01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:00.920\nTo be honest with you...\n\n01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.920\nCharacterizes a force of nature rather than...\n\n01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:06.920\nFeel like there's a lot of stuff and it's in a normal world.\n\n01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:11.920\nLet's say you work in human resources and there's four or five people in the cubicles section with you.\n\n01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:16.920\nAnd you hate Frank and you have some problems with Laurie and this, that, and the other.\n\n01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:22.920\nBut right now we are living in a world where you are constantly reminded that those things are misguided,\n\n01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.920\nmalintended, you really can't do that in the real world.\n\n01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:34.920\nIt wasn't too long ago that you could print out a list of the ten most sexist jokes you could think of,\n\n01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:39.920\nten most racist things you could think of and pass it around and the people that were with you would do it.\n\n01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:40.920\nYou can't do that shit anymore.\n\n01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:44.920\nYou can't do that shit or you've got to go dark web about it and then if you get fined out you're fired and you can't.\n\n01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.920\nBut you can and every once in a while you see this happens.\n\n01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:50.920\nNow you can't and those people are constantly reminded that they've got to either adjust,\n\n01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:55.920\nopen up their world and figure out a way to be or they've got to calcify themselves and harden,\n\n01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:00.920\nossify and like tighten up and what they're banking on often in these sites I think is that,\n\n01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:05.920\nyou know, you've got to go somewhere, you know, you've got to put yourself someplace.\n\n01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.920\nThey're saying, here's a room and here's a jar, you know, squeeze in whatever...\n\n01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:12.920\nThat was a very compelling argument that I finally registered in my head.\n\n01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:14.920\nYeah, I do think that that's what it is.\n\n01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:17.920\nYou're saying that's enabling.\n\n01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:22.920\nI think what I heard you just say is that there's actually hope for the future in terms of that,\n\n01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:28.920\nthat as progress happens there's restraint happening and actually these crevices that you can go down\n\n01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:33.920\nand explore deep darkness that those are actually just enabling like something that maybe should...\n\n01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.920\nI wonder if the...\n\n01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:37.920\nWe should cut off.\n\n01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.920\nI wonder if the market model hasn't changed to that now where it's just sort of these things that you...\n\n01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:44.920\nTrust me, it's a holiday.\n\n01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:48.920\nMany of you are going to go home and you're going to have people sitting at the table who are going to say something\n\n01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:51.920\nand the whole table is going to stop and look and they're like, what?\n\n01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:54.920\nY'all didn't care about that three years ago.\n\n01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:59.920\nBut those people, imagine being that person and every single day television,\n\n01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:07.920\neverything, commercials, are reminding you that where you thought you had planted yourself in life is where you're going to stay\n\n01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:10.920\nand not only are you behind the curve, but you've been behind for a long time.\n\n01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:13.920\nIt just didn't get loud enough until now for you to see it.\n\n01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:16.920\nSo the amount of catch-up work you're going to have to do is...\n\n01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.920\nThat mountain is steep and you've either got to run hard and run fast and run long\n\n01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:26.920\nor run slowly and probably not live to see your sort of comeuppance.\n\n01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:29.920\nBut it can be an exhausting proposition.\n\n01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:35.920\nSo what do you do? You live day to day to day and under the weight of that thing.\n\n01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:41.920\nAnd I mean, if you read Rick Bass or the authors of the modern...\n\n01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:42.920\nAnd I will.\n\n01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:48.920\nThe modern American authors right now who are writing, who have replaced the Mailers and the Updates and the Carvers,\n\n01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:51.920\nthese are the pressures that they're writing about right now.\n\n01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:58.920\nThe protagonists, the Carver protagonists, back then, often what they were dealing with was marriage\n\n01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:02.920\nand relationships and modern relationships and the things that we've been taught\n\n01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:06.920\nand how those things don't necessarily apply because the world around us is changing.\n\n01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:12.920\nAnd so how do suburban dreams continue to exist?\n\n01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:15.920\nHow do we keep that framework up when everything around us is changing?\n\n01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:21.920\nYou know, that kind of stuff. What's changing now, I think, is affecting people individually who come from that world\n\n01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:28.920\nbecause they now have to get out of that neighborhood and they have to deal with a whole other set of principles\n\n01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:34.920\nand that tension in those people, that coiled tension.\n\n01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:41.920\nIf you offer a release to somebody and say nobody can see it because it's happening in a world that is gridless, basically.\n\n01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:48.920\nYou think that's, you're saying that's like the ring of power, that's like giving a piece of heroin.\n\n01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:56.920\nYou're saying there's a lot of that sort of pebble of incentive stuff going on in people.\n\n01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:01.920\nI'm having a totally different experience that is absolutely, probably equally valid.\n\n01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:09.920\nI would even probably go so far as a self-loathing person to say your point of view is way more valid.\n\n01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:16.920\nBut I'm having the exact opposite experience right now because I just got divorced,\n\n01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:27.920\nwhich means that I lived in a world like for years where everything was about the obligations that I had to everybody around me.\n\n01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:33.920\nAnd of course, middle-aged men, they get divorced and then they, characteristically, they get the tattoo and the Tesla\n\n01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:39.920\nand they start saying inappropriate things to their younger coworkers and they just turn into douchey cavemen.\n\n01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:47.920\nAnd I think part of that is that it's like this pendulum that swings back and forth between reality and fantasy.\n\n01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:55.920\nAnd I think that in a world where we all have like USB slots in our foreheads at this point,\n\n01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:02.920\nI think one of our biggest issues that we're contending with that we haven't actually labeled is the division between fantasy and reality.\n\n01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:11.920\nBecause we are such a successful empire and one of the things that we've successfully done so much is created\n\n01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:17.920\nlike these dreams that we dream together and we don't even really, all we do is go to work and pull levers\n\n01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:19.920\nand then it's like we watch six hours of TV a day.\n\n01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:27.920\nSo it's like we don't actually, it's like actually a big deal if someone on TV makes us think a certain thing\n\n01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:33.920\nor represents a certain demographic as a thing, it's like we look at that as the same as a senator voting wrong\n\n01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:40.920\nand we get very upset and I think one of the big crucial issues is we have so little respect for ourselves\n\n01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:48.920\nthat we can't actively go, here's reality and here's actually like, here's my biochemistry,\n\n01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:55.920\nhere's like my fucked upness which is this sewer where I like watch dinosaurs chase motorcycles\n\n01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:59.920\nbut we won't do it because then the guy in the motorcycle goes by the way I'm running for president next week\n\n01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:04.920\nand we're like oh really, yeah that makes sense, of course you would, you outran a dinosaur\n\n01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:11.920\nand if the dinosaur says like you should buy a Panasonic but Panasonic turns out to make landmines\n\n01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:18.920\nwe're like oh I'm going to boycott your company, we have no division, because we sit around and just watch,\n\n01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:28.920\nwe were the third act of WALL-E, like we just sit and watch shit, like that shit actually ironically is\n\n01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:37.920\ntoxically infected with reality, because right now what I'm experiencing is a douchey middle aged divorcee\n\n01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:43.920\nis like indulgence in fantasy and it's making me a happier person in my day to day life\n\n01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:51.920\nbecause I'm actually actively able to like I go ugh and I come and then I go time to go to work, that was dark\n\n01:45:51.920 --> 01:46:06.920\nand then I'm like something got, I feel like something got, now in my mind what my view is something got released\n\n01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:12.920\nand what your view is which is equally valid as I said if not more is that maybe something got along the way\n\n01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:18.920\ndepending on what you're indulging maybe there's seeds getting planted, there's things being affirmed or perpetuated\n\n01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:22.920\nI just think that people are different, I think that on the other end of that the moneymaker end of it\n\n01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:28.920\nthe reason somebody, I mean you have no idea the guys programming these sites, people programming these sites\n\n01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:34.920\nmight be the most liberal, most understanding people in the world but from a moneymaking end of it they understand that\n\n01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:46.920\nthat's the goose, so that's the golden goose and so they're just going to keep finding ways to maximize that potential\n\n01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:55.920\nand you can see what you were talking about in this run of GOP debates from the first one up to the last one this past week\n\n01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:00.920\nthere's no reason any of these debates said anything that anybody needs to think anything about\n\n01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:06.920\nthere's no reason any of these polls say anything that anybody really needs to think anything about\n\n01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:13.920\nwhat's going to happen is in January we're going to wipe all that, anybody who knows anything is going to wipe all that shit out\n\n01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:20.920\nIowa is going to happen, I believe New Hampshire still is going to happen next and so and that's a caucus I think\n\n01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:26.920\nand so what's going to happen is that whole paradigm is going to fall away and if you ask the question\n\n01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:31.920\nwell why the hell do we spend so much time on it, well there are so many cottage industries that are connected to\n\n01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:38.920\nthe idea of broadcasting that, making graphics for it, making that sort of Mad Max Fury Road\n\n01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:44.920\nflaming guitar theme music for it that scares the shit out of us and all that other stuff\n\n01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:48.920\nI don't know, that Ted Cruz guy, he's got the goods\n\n01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:56.920\nbut wait, in January when we start having our first debates that's when it actually really counts, that's when it matters\n\n01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:59.920\nand from that point on you can calibrate and in the past that's the way it's been\n\n01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:04.920\nbut it's interesting how many more debates there are in the lead up to this given this particular situation\n\n01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:09.920\nand to watch this happen and watch how many people are talking about it, how many headlines are posted about it\n\n01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:17.920\nhow many are in gigantic bold, just as if this is the Lindbergh baby resolution and none of this shit is real\n\n01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:22.920\nwell you've given us the perfect segue into our regular segment Rob Schrab's Politics Corner\n\n01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:36.920\nmusic\n\n01:48:36.920 -->
