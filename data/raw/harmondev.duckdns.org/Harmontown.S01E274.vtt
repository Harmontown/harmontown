WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Well, I love music. That's why I'm here today.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Here we go.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Yeah, that's a Rob Tanchum jam.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
From San Francisco, California,

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
in the world-famous San Francisco sketch fest

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
here at the Memorial Marines Auditorium.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Claremontown is now in session.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Give it up for your game master, Spencer Crittenden.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Thank you, thank you.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Also, give it up for your deputy district attorney, Rob Schrobb,

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
who's here tonight.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
And the mayor of Harmontown is Dan Harmon.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Very sorry. Thank you.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
So sorry.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Master of Apologies. I'm so sorry.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
It's so good to be back here.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I love San Francisco, obviously,

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
but more importantly, we love the Marine Memorial Theater.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Casino Hotel and Water Park.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
I probably expressed this last time.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Is my mic too hot? That's fine, right?

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
That's not an answer to my question.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Folks, I'm sorry for everything.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
It sounds good to me. Is it because of you guys out there?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
I just...

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
But if I go like this,

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
that's if I want to do like a Richard Pryor joke

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
where I'm like, you're going on the street and you see the guy

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
and he's like, what are you doing, son?

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Okay. I'll save that character for later.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
But yeah, I'm just worried about...

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
When I hear the word Marine and Memorial,

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I think of the ghost of my grandfather,

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
who lied about his age to fight fascists

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
and who is watching me in my 45th year of life

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
with his arms folded,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
a cigarette dangling from his lips

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
in a costume designed by the Dunkirk creators.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
And I was just going like, when are you ever going to get off your ass

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
and stop these fucking Nazis?

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
I was 16.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
I lied about my age for the privilege of storming Normandy

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
and you joined an improv troupe.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
You're at 30.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
You are such a fucking shameful load of fat.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
When did he tell you that he lied about his age?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Well, my grandma told me, I don't know.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
When?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
What do you mean, when?

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Depositioning my fucking dead grandpa?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Where is this going?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
You think he didn't lie about his age?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
He's lying about lying about his age.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
You seem like you're hiding something.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
You're distracting from the issues that people want to hear.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
I want to see a receipt about your lie.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
That's what we're alleging.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I'm going to shut down Harmon Channel until we get to the bottom

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
as we can strike a deal.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm going to shut down Harmon Channel.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Was it like Christmas?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Was it birthday?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I have a confession to make, Danny.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I have a confession to make.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I wasn't 18.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I wasn't 18.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
He never confessed to me.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I don't have that power.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
It was that knowledge that was handed down from our family.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
I just wanted some backstory.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Anyways, it's good to be back in the Marine Memorial Theater

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
if that's what it's called in San Francisco.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
You know, it's great here.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
If you stay at the hotel here, which I have several times,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
and it's lovely, and the people here are great,

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
the towels in there are must-hotel towels, white.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
These towels here, they're kind of like...

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
They have little guns on them.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
They're kind of like peach, mauve-y,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
like kind of beige-y peach-colored.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Like your grandpa's or grandma's.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
They're storming themselves.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Yes.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
They're marine towels.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
They're not...

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
From the balls of Montezuma...

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
To the cheeks of triple that.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
We will dry your entire body.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
We are marine memorial towels.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
I don't think from the balls of Montezuma landed as hard as that should have.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
I thought that was a pretty solid marine testicle joke.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Yeah, I...

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
By the way, there's no show tonight.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
I don't have anything.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
But this is the first Harmontown show we've had with an audience.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I mean, like...

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
In a while.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
So I don't want you to be punished.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
There's probably more important stuff for you guys to be at.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
You paid money for tickets tonight.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I have nothing but change. Why are there empty seats?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I thought this was sold out.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
That was the first thing I thought.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
What the fuck?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
There's way too many empty seats.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
What in the fuck?

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
And this is the bottom row. God knows what the balcony looks like.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
How's my balcony doing?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Oh, yeah.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
The Schrab got into the audience.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
This will work out great.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
I mean, we've been famously sold out for weeks,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
and there's just seats there.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
There's a bunch of seats.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
I don't give a shit.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Everybody, move over one seat.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
All right, I got...

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
We have a great show for you tonight.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I promise you that.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Prove it.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Prove it.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Uh-oh.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I think we have a heckler in the front row, Dan.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Just ignore him.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Prove it.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
One...

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Schrab is feeding back.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
I'm sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Go ahead.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I was going to try to stay sober for this show,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
but I think I'm going to start drinking now.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
For people who are going to be listening to this as an audio package,

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
why is that tiny microphone-sized speaker even there?

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
It seems exclusively designed for him to do that.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Rob showed up here two weeks ago

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
to totally out-rig this entire theater

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
with audio equipment jokes.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Wait, what? No, he's...

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Somebody set off my mic.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
That was the sound of Rob getting back on stage.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Oh, God.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
How did you know that wasn't going to make

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
a horrible ear piercing screech

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
that would make everybody bummed out?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Well, I was hoping it would.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
That could have been a nightmare.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Hey, do you forget?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
It's like you're dealing with...

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
That's like asking...

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I have this voice.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Your piercing is...

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
is my...

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Your whole life is feedback.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
It's like asking Ed Gein,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
how did you know your mom's head

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
wouldn't start talking to you

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
when you placed it at the foot of your bed?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
All right, all right.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
Too soon and or too regional.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I'm from Wisconsin.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Wow.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Let's spend the next 20 minutes recovering from that.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Of all the metaphors I could have used.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I'm so sorry.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
It was temporal or regional.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
I think it was just fucking...

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Bad metaphor.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Well, I thought they were on my side for one second,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
but...

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I have one...

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
I got one thing in my Bear Notes app.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Bear Notes is interesting.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
It's tag cloud-based. You should check it out.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
It's a notes app for

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
like kind of hairier, bigger homosexuals, right?

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
Why does that fly here?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
And my...

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I can't win for losing.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I made a joke

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
that should have only offended three people

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
from Plainfield, Wisconsin.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Stop capping the microphones.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
What is he doing?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
He wants you to say hello.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Rob Scoot, you're the best.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Rob, stop capping the microphones.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Stop capping the microphones.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
What is he doing?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
He wants you to say hello.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Rob, Scoot, you're still forward.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I flew you out here.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Yeah, yeah.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
I don't know why you did either.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
You're like, you want to go?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I'm like, okay, sure.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
You know what's going to happen.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Because you seemed sad

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
and I wanted to make you happy.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
I didn't know making you happy would make me sad.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
That's not fair.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
What am I, the green mile guy?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I'm just sucking up your sadness

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
and then I'm going to...

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
No, you groaned that?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
What, he made a bear joke?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
That's a fictional guy

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
from a movie from 20 years ago.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
You're offended by everything I do.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I accept it.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
I am sorry.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I am the master

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
of apologize.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I have one grievance.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
I have one airline grievance left.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Everyone

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
that listens to the podcast knows

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I fly around.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
I have a million airline grievances.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I have one airline grievance.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I don't like airlines.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
They're terrible.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I'm not going to waste your time with that.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
You know you're San Franciscans.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
You're leftists.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
You're socialists.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
You know airlines are a cartel.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
You know they're garbage people.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
But

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
now let's zoom in.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
On the food, right?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
You hear about this airline food?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
It's not airline food.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Oh.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I mean, the peanuts, they don't even give you the peanuts anymore.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Why do they call it airlines?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
When they...

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Virgin... Clearly...

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Virgin Atlantic.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Virgin America.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
What the fuck?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Now it's a subsidiary of Alaska.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Alaska.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
A subsidiary of Kleenex.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
I don't know.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
They're very groovy.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I applaud it.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Oh god, I know where this is going.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Compared to every other airline

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
that tries to

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
make their seat...

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I hate that.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I don't like it.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I did it already.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
That's what I'm talking about.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Don't steal my complete thunder.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
That's what I'm talking about.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Me and Greg Bruce get up and dance to it

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
with the flight attendants now.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
We start doing a little music video.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
And the person says...

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Aren't you supposed to stay in your seat?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
You're getting up and dancing?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Don't get ahead of Dan.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Continue.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
To the.0001% of you

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
that have never operated a seatbelt?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Really?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Here's my problem.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
This is a comedy writer.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Break that down.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Take a scalpel. Cut it in half.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
This is what we call a sock barrel in comedy rooms.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
But it's nothing new.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
She could have said

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
to the.001% of you

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
that have never operated a seatbelt

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
and then continued,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
and it might have been funny.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Also,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
she could have said

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
to those of you that have never operated

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
the seatbelt,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
really?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
And it might have been funny.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Saying to the.001%

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
of you that have never operated a seatbelt,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.640
with the.001% of their heart

12:41.800 --> 12:46.800
that is naturally predisposed to identify with the underdog.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.640
Whether these people know it or not,

12:50.640 --> 12:55.440
you're leaning in and then she kicks you in the nuts.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.000
Really?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.600
And you're like, my nuts were pre-kicked.

13:00.520 --> 13:02.240
Hat on a hat.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.200
Look it up.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.040
All right.

13:04.040 --> 13:04.880
Okay, Dan, Dan.

13:04.880 --> 13:05.720
It doesn't matter.

13:05.720 --> 13:06.880
Now dead, ostensibly,

13:06.880 --> 13:08.720
because maybe they treated their customers well.

13:08.720 --> 13:09.560
I don't know.

13:09.560 --> 13:12.800
Like, I used to enjoy traveling by Virgin.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.440
JetBlue is now property of Clorox.

13:15.440 --> 13:16.580
I don't know.

13:16.580 --> 13:17.420
Doesn't matter.

13:17.420 --> 13:19.720
You guys are, you're like, wait, yeah, Dan.

13:19.720 --> 13:20.560
Yeah, please.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.200
Let's come to a Marine Memorial Theater.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.800
We're gonna hear your fucking quibbles

13:23.800 --> 13:25.280
about your first-class travel.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.120
Yeah.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.840
That's called stagecraft, you guys.

13:37.840 --> 13:38.960
Yeah.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.080
But here's the thing, man.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.040
When we travel by airplane,

13:42.040 --> 13:43.640
we're all in the same position.

13:43.640 --> 13:47.680
We're all being forced by a weird something-something

13:47.680 --> 13:49.560
complex to force it.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.960
Ah, I gotta read my child's key.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.280
Dan, here's the thing.

13:52.280 --> 13:53.880
I feel like we've talked about this before,

13:53.880 --> 13:54.840
but here's the difference.

13:54.840 --> 13:55.680
All right, noted.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.520
And you're not gonna like this.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.360
You're not gonna like any part of this.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.720
You've only heard that song in first-class

14:02.720 --> 14:05.040
where you don't get to see the video that goes along with it.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.480
Did you not need to see her going like this?

14:07.480 --> 14:08.320
Oh, you need to see?

14:08.320 --> 14:09.160
No.

14:09.160 --> 14:10.000
It's a cartoon character.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
I forget if it's like a moose next to a squirrel,

14:12.000 --> 14:13.120
or I don't forget what it is.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.800
And on the cartoon version of it, you watch,

14:16.800 --> 14:19.800
it actually, it's less offensive when you see

14:19.800 --> 14:23.360
the power dynamic of the two characters

14:23.360 --> 14:25.040
saying that to each other.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.840
But you've only heard that from your causative bullshit,

14:27.840 --> 14:32.840
rich, Sony, NBC, cable, what do you want now?

14:35.320 --> 14:36.160
I don't know.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.240
Yeah, I don't know either.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.440
Yeah, keep abusing me.

14:39.440 --> 14:42.240
Everybody keeps shoveling me down into a ditch.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.640
They're like, oh, you're so privileged.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.440
I'm like, I'm privileged to death.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.440
Yeah, yeah, I'm saying it.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.000
Yeah, do you know how hard it is to be privileged?

14:50.000 --> 14:53.800
Have you ever stopped to think about it?

14:53.800 --> 14:57.360
Oh, I wonder what it's like to be privileged.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.840
You never think about it.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.440
Hashtag me.

15:02.440 --> 15:03.760
I know.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.320
Ha ha ha ha.

15:05.320 --> 15:26.760
all right well that that that should conclude the us portion of the show I

15:26.760 --> 15:31.120
let's get the show I want to I want to tell you guys a story you're you're

15:31.120 --> 15:41.520
Franciscans so you guys hello you guys live at the epicenter of hate and ash

15:41.520 --> 15:48.120
ash for man a ribbon you were the hippie thing started in the 1960s or

15:48.120 --> 15:52.420
something the first bra was burnt at the at the quarter of the two blocks on

15:52.420 --> 15:59.960
203 North Hague hate and the corner of Ashbury North and like this city's

15:59.960 --> 16:02.960
always had a weird relationship he's like a counterculture and then it's

16:02.960 --> 16:06.520
like and then it's such a nice place to live that the yuppies move in and they

16:06.520 --> 16:10.680
overtake and all this shit and like most recently oh Silicon Valley oh god

16:10.680 --> 16:14.280
Jesus Christ all these people these computer programmers some of them are

16:14.280 --> 16:20.480
here among us they I think they know I moved here because I want this poor

16:20.480 --> 16:26.560
person's apartment how much how much money can I pay for for it to shove them

16:26.560 --> 16:30.040
out with money and it's not their money but they're just being shoved out by

16:30.040 --> 16:34.640
money and we don't know where they go Oakland I don't know

16:34.640 --> 16:49.920
Oakland give it up for Oakland but then with a lucky number is 911 but the the

16:49.920 --> 16:54.760
intersection between those those roads like the smart people whose buses you

16:54.760 --> 17:00.520
you visit Goths block you're going like your bus will not pass and and the

17:00.520 --> 17:05.380
people inside those buses going I look I came here from Thailand I don't know

17:05.380 --> 17:11.440
what's going on I like it all intersects with innovation and and the human

17:11.440 --> 17:20.960
spirit and the individual triumph I want to tell you a story I thought you

17:20.960 --> 17:25.720
were I am I am okay all right I just wanted to remind them okay right I'm

17:25.720 --> 17:35.120
telling you a story there was once upon a time there was a man and I know that

17:35.120 --> 17:43.720
already makes it less marketable story but that's the truth there was a man who

17:43.720 --> 17:50.960
was a trumpet enthusiast and he will a brass enthusiast well a brass

17:50.960 --> 17:57.880
enthusiast which made him by default a trumpet enthusiast right you can

17:57.880 --> 18:02.480
interrupt anytime you want it's fine I'm not oh is it fine this is what fine is

18:02.480 --> 18:18.720
that okay is it all right anytime it's not even making sound what is he do is

18:18.720 --> 18:26.480
this insane I feel like Jane Goodall what am I like I like I feel like I'm

18:26.480 --> 18:31.960
trying to just get everyone to have tea with me and then I'll then I'll be like

18:31.960 --> 18:34.960
I thought you were setting me up I thought you were setting me up once

18:34.960 --> 18:42.600
upon a time there was a guy who was such a brass enthusiast that he's like I

18:42.600 --> 18:48.880
want to share my brass enthusiasm with the world and this new technology comes

18:48.880 --> 18:53.680
along oh you can make apps and he and he goes you know what I'm gonna I want

18:53.680 --> 18:58.520
everyone to learn the glory of the trumpet and I'm gonna make an app and I'm

18:58.520 --> 19:06.560
gonna call it I Trump because I trumpet is too long and then a guy started

19:06.560 --> 19:15.440
suing him in 2011 named Donald Trump and long story short but let's hear the

19:15.440 --> 19:23.360
rest of the story this man Donald Trump spent a total of something like half a

19:23.360 --> 19:29.320
decade trying to intimidate and sue this guy into non-existence just trying to

19:29.320 --> 19:35.520
get him to stop calling his app about trumpets I Trump this guy represented

19:35.520 --> 19:48.480
himself in court and beat him and one please welcome Tom Scharfeld yeah the

19:48.480 --> 19:59.080
San Francisco spirit embodied I don't know was that a good introduction or was

19:59.080 --> 20:07.520
that like weird can we can we help you out do that all yeah can we lower your

20:07.520 --> 20:18.160
stool but yeah I mean I'm I'm getting your story sloppy but there are parts

20:18.160 --> 20:30.000
that are very fascinating about it first of all you got to hit it my favorite

20:30.000 --> 20:35.680
part of it is that you're not you you're not who's the most hurt you're not

20:35.680 --> 20:41.160
Herb Alpert that's a famous trumpet guy right you're not like you never said

20:41.160 --> 20:44.240
that you were you're not like I'm the best trumpet player the world you love

20:44.240 --> 20:55.680
like right you have an app called I bone for trombone I'm not laughing they

20:55.680 --> 20:59.320
laughed but they also applaud because they love you something I'm a trombone

20:59.320 --> 21:02.160
player I've been playing trombone my whole life well you got to eat that Mike

21:02.160 --> 21:08.160
imagine it's an instrument okay I'm a trombone player for the record and I've

21:08.160 --> 21:13.240
been playing pretty much my whole life and but Miles Davis is one of my big

21:13.240 --> 21:18.600
idols so I love trumpet and and so he's like the Herb Alpert of trumpet players

21:18.600 --> 21:22.240
I like her about her as well you guys don't realize Miles Davis was just

21:22.240 --> 21:27.240
outed called out yesterday at a different podcast so so what was the

21:27.240 --> 21:38.200
original question I continue sorry I'm I'm being a petty vandal I'm angry go

21:38.200 --> 21:44.840
ahead okay no could you remind you of what we're talking about yeah no I said

21:44.840 --> 21:49.000
you you had a you had a I bone app right and I'm right now I'm not being a

21:49.000 --> 21:53.920
loof I'm pulling up your app okay yeah so I bone was my first iPhone app it was

21:53.920 --> 21:56.480
really an experiment but it was something that I knew because I've been

21:56.480 --> 21:59.760
playing trombone my whole life and I launched you know I worked on it for a

21:59.760 --> 22:03.400
few months and got it out this was back in 2009 launch and it was it was a

22:03.400 --> 22:07.600
success you know I got some good feedback and and then I you know I got to

22:07.600 --> 22:11.080
work on a trumpet pretty much right away and you know a lot of work designing it

22:11.080 --> 22:13.640
trying to get the interface right because I was trying to make something

22:13.640 --> 22:16.280
playable and intuitive for real players you know something you could actually

22:16.280 --> 22:22.280
use as a practice to learn from and was and so so the the trombone was your

22:22.280 --> 22:25.080
favorite thing but like you you felt like you nailed it and then you're like

22:25.080 --> 22:29.160
I'm gonna move on to the other instrument right so I'll call it I Trump this is

22:29.160 --> 22:36.040
2011 right so then something comes in the mail yeah so pretty much I launched it

22:36.040 --> 22:42.920
maybe I can provide some soundtrack for this story so I yes yeah so launched it

22:42.920 --> 22:46.880
in January 2011

22:48.120 --> 22:52.320
it's you those of you listening I'm providing that soundtrack with this

22:52.320 --> 23:01.480
amazing $2 app yeah it's not a real trumpet I am very very affordable

23:01.480 --> 23:08.000
compared to the price of fascism sorry yeah continue so I launched it at the

23:08.000 --> 23:11.520
NAMM show I don't know if you know the NAMM show it's a big music merchandising

23:11.520 --> 23:18.800
show in Anaheim and we all we're all very familiar with yeah so there's a

23:18.800 --> 23:23.840
biggest trade show in Anaheim but 80,000 people or something so anyway you don't

23:23.840 --> 23:27.120
have to sell it it was a good launch it was a good launch after two years into

23:27.120 --> 23:31.040
a good launch it was in USA today and then two weeks later I got a cease and

23:31.040 --> 23:39.800
desist letter from Donald Trump and and on say well I got the letter all right

23:39.800 --> 23:45.400
so you get the letter and it says stop stop calling your app I Trump right so

23:45.400 --> 23:56.480
my boss I'm a lawyer from Dewey Cheetahman Howe and I I stopped calling it

23:56.480 --> 24:00.680
I Trump you know there's only one Trump and anyone that's ever gonna call

24:00.680 --> 24:06.440
something I Trump is the big big buster himself okay so you read that letter

24:06.440 --> 24:11.160
right and he claimed compute he had some computer games and he claimed that he

24:11.160 --> 24:16.800
claimed he had computer games and iPhone apps and he claimed that he that I was

24:16.800 --> 24:21.000
trading off of goodwill that he had generated he thought you were writing on

24:21.000 --> 24:27.400
the back of the popularity of Donald Trump in 2011 yes with your app about

24:27.400 --> 24:34.320
Trump yes yes and he claimed that you know it's sorry Trump it's known as

24:34.320 --> 24:42.080
so yeah he claimed it was it's it's known as a horn and not a Trump and and so

24:42.080 --> 24:52.440
anyway I that was the that's their argument it's yeah the instrument you're

24:52.440 --> 24:57.080
describing is not called a Trump my boss is called a truck it's known as a horn

24:57.080 --> 25:02.800
anyway basically all brass instruments and no no horns anyway so I got the

25:02.800 --> 25:06.560
letter and I I honestly thought it was it felt like some kind of you know it

25:06.560 --> 25:11.080
felt like April Fool's or something so I actually I saw it on my phone and I

25:11.080 --> 25:15.200
laid down on my bed and pulled the computer up just you know to take some

25:15.200 --> 25:19.960
time to read it and then I the first thing I did was to actually go to the

25:19.960 --> 25:24.280
lawyer lawyer's webpage to make sure it was a legitimate like a real firm you

25:24.280 --> 25:30.200
know that might be your friend yeah I was out of you know completely out of

25:30.200 --> 25:35.120
this world it was I so I wasn't I wasn't afraid right I was really just more

25:35.120 --> 25:39.680
shocked right I mean you know it just didn't seem real right at this point I

25:39.680 --> 25:45.960
just want to interject how is your eye bone money like keeping you afloat like

25:45.960 --> 25:50.360
are you I just want to get a get a sense of like are you in a one bedroom

25:50.360 --> 25:55.880
apartment a two bedroom apartment are you are you married are you a trust fund

25:55.880 --> 26:01.320
guy are you you know we want to feel your protagonist so I started doing apps

26:01.320 --> 26:09.400
like when I was 29 30 and I had saved the money you know before and then I

26:09.400 --> 26:12.640
started working on some different projects which didn't make a lot of money

26:12.640 --> 26:18.320
I've only made you know some money you know and but it's volatile you know it

26:18.320 --> 26:21.960
doesn't just last you have to continue to develop and to promote it you weren't

26:21.960 --> 26:29.800
sitting on a war chest but no one here is sitting on a watch but but but but I

26:29.800 --> 26:33.880
really believe in my products you know and I really have you know how to hope

26:33.880 --> 26:37.840
and dream this is why I love you this is why you're a hero okay because you're

26:37.840 --> 26:42.360
passionate about fucking brass instruments yeah well which is the

26:42.360 --> 26:47.240
opposite of Donald Trump and he's not passionate about anything so I worked on

26:47.240 --> 26:50.120
products that I haven't been that passionate about and when I started

26:50.120 --> 26:53.880
working on on projects that I was passionate about it was like you know

26:53.880 --> 26:58.160
it's something amazing what are the products you weren't passionate about I

26:58.160 --> 27:10.240
mean I mean maybe we die he's yeah I mean I salad just one well I mean the

27:10.240 --> 27:14.560
one I did immediately prior to I bone was that was a service called whoop tones

27:14.560 --> 27:21.600
whoop tones oh that sounds familiar and I loved I'm sorry I was passionate about

27:21.600 --> 27:29.200
it for a while but then the meaning wasn't there you know so the product

27:29.200 --> 27:34.320
what it did was spark goes out sometimes it was basically pre-smartphone it

27:34.320 --> 27:39.320
allowed you to call people and play sound effects during the phone call and I

27:39.320 --> 27:45.680
like that all right I mean you can't do that when I may you know I could like a

27:45.680 --> 27:50.440
sound board like I could call Jeff and go like hey man do you want to hang out

27:50.440 --> 27:56.920
and then press a button you could and you exactly yeah so the model the

27:56.920 --> 28:02.040
slogan was it was whoop tones press one to fart was the slogan that's the slogan

28:02.040 --> 28:07.120
of the company whoop Jones press one to fart right okay but but you could

28:07.120 --> 28:14.960
actually take the sounds and you are that's from 2005 it was launched it's

28:14.960 --> 28:20.800
still 2005 farts Dan but are you picking up emotionally and the fact that you

28:20.800 --> 28:28.320
are the hero that we've always wanted but anyway you could play scenes to you

28:28.320 --> 28:31.520
know backgrounds that would loop to create the impression you're elsewhere

28:31.520 --> 28:36.880
you could do that too oh like so you could do like a foggy harbor in London

28:36.880 --> 28:45.680
yeah like hey I can't make it to work my ship is Pat Paddington is lost a bunch

28:45.680 --> 28:50.560
of typewriters and people talking right now I got a big story coming out right

28:50.560 --> 28:57.240
now it's in there that's what is the office okay but anyway so I worked on

28:57.240 --> 29:04.080
it for two years and I just really didn't get anywhere and and I so I started

29:04.080 --> 29:08.480
to lose the passion for it and and you know part of it was the meaning for me

29:08.480 --> 29:11.560
wasn't there you know it wasn't something I could go back to my child and

29:11.560 --> 29:17.560
latch on to you know but the trombone was when you're in school was that your

29:17.560 --> 29:21.760
first instrument in school yeah you know my my you know idols Miles Davis JJ

29:21.760 --> 29:25.920
Johnson trombone player but but but it's something that really meant something

29:25.920 --> 29:30.720
and so if I could do something for those kids or the ex-players that are you know

29:30.720 --> 29:35.080
the seniors and whatever deprived of music budgets and there's so the meaning

29:35.080 --> 29:39.000
was there and is there a market I didn't know but but it was it was an

29:39.000 --> 29:41.760
experiment you know it was a way to learn how to build an app it was my first

29:41.760 --> 29:47.520
app and but because I knew I knew I knew what the trombone what I knew how I

29:47.520 --> 29:50.600
would design it immediately it was just about trying to figure out how to build

29:50.600 --> 29:54.400
the app you know but when I started to get good feedback you know I just kept

29:54.400 --> 30:00.320
on going yeah yeah so that you're like yeah let's the the I bone didn't make you

30:00.320 --> 30:06.040
a billionaire it gave you an emotional cue that you're like I should keep

30:06.040 --> 30:10.480
following this path of bliss yeah but I am going to now do the right I could see

30:10.480 --> 30:16.240
a path to maybe not billions but maybe millions seriously yeah I could see it

30:16.240 --> 30:20.800
but at any rate yeah like oh like that your your job had had coincided with your

30:20.800 --> 30:24.480
fulfillment and you're like right I Trump right and so that's what I was kind

30:24.480 --> 30:30.000
of going for the letter the guy goes I'm Trump I will be I Trump I'm gonna be I

30:30.000 --> 30:36.560
Trump and then so then here's the part where you become a god because you don't

30:36.560 --> 30:47.440
go oh shit Trump is suing me I'll just do the I flute you represent yourself and

30:47.440 --> 30:53.920
just go through this process that takes forever and the whole time I'm not I

30:53.920 --> 30:57.440
don't want to put words in your mouth like you're you had to go through this

30:57.440 --> 31:02.880
whole thing you know it was never you in court next to him it was just people and

31:02.880 --> 31:09.400
probably mostly paperwork right but yeah I mean so you know it's a long process

31:09.400 --> 31:12.840
and you know I just kind of took it step-by-step and I didn't really know

31:12.840 --> 31:16.240
what I was getting into but you know when it starts with something that's

31:16.240 --> 31:20.560
ridiculous I mean that's what it seemed like to me if somebody goes like hey you

31:20.560 --> 31:26.840
over there that's my name right it's my property I was being mugged by like him

31:26.840 --> 31:29.880
he himself you know it's like you're out in the street in New York and he comes

31:29.880 --> 31:33.400
out of nowhere and robs you yeah I mean that's what it felt like yeah and like

31:33.400 --> 31:40.080
you know what am I supposed like you're little Bruce Wayne and your

31:40.080 --> 31:43.200
parents are coming out of the opera house and then a fucking dude that's even

31:43.200 --> 31:52.920
richer than them is like it's right I want everyone's not real people I'll

31:52.920 --> 31:58.680
grow to produce tragedies real Rob and you're laughing but that's what it felt

31:58.680 --> 32:04.400
like and that feeling persisted right for years and and so anyway you know I

32:04.400 --> 32:08.160
continue I checked it out I you know I asked them lawyers you know what they

32:08.160 --> 32:10.800
thought about it just to you know for reality check to make sure I'm you know

32:10.800 --> 32:14.720
I knew a little bit because I'd gone trademarks to the office but I got a

32:14.720 --> 32:20.560
reality check and I guess that's supposed to sound like a road of trials

32:20.560 --> 32:28.120
beat but I have a quick question yeah did so when you were developing I Trump

32:28.120 --> 32:34.400
did any point in your mind were you like going it kind of sounds like like that

32:34.400 --> 32:39.320
Donald Trump guy like we did you did that ever cross your mind it never did

32:39.320 --> 32:44.680
because this was you know 2011 like oh is that the guy from Home Alone 2 right

32:44.680 --> 32:49.000
no it's that's the guy that's the birther conspiracy guy yeah the guy from

32:49.000 --> 32:53.520
the guy that's been trying to run for president for 35 years basically in

32:53.520 --> 32:57.760
secrecy because no one cared yeah I know it never crossed my mind not once and

32:57.760 --> 33:01.640
that's that's why that letter was so you know and there's another threshold you

33:01.640 --> 33:07.640
cross this is what's important is that you you defeat this and you do it

33:07.640 --> 33:11.480
representing yourself they got their lawyers they're hoping you're gonna get

33:11.480 --> 33:16.600
scared go bankrupt you stick to it you reach a point where you have the right

33:16.600 --> 33:24.680
to do your thing but then you okay so like every hero okay so so and then

33:24.680 --> 33:28.400
that's after the litigation started the following year as I continued to use the

33:28.400 --> 33:33.800
app and continue to sell it and everything and and and so the litigation

33:33.800 --> 33:38.480
you know that was I was gonna try to use a lawyer for that but but that fell

33:38.480 --> 33:43.440
through like the day before my my dad mysteriously the way litigation works

33:43.440 --> 33:50.520
he died in a tuba accident like I won't get into it nine hookers nine Russian

33:50.520 --> 33:55.880
hookers fell on him from the top of a shitty building I don't know I don't

33:55.880 --> 34:01.080
know what happened anyway it fell through and he was strangled with bad

34:01.080 --> 34:07.800
clothing and showed with an eatable steak sorry but so the one side you know

34:07.800 --> 34:11.360
that the plaintiff files the complaint first you got 40 days to answer so it was

34:11.360 --> 34:16.160
a couple days before the answer was due that that this fell through so I go I'm

34:16.160 --> 34:20.000
myself and I do it myself for that and then that was you know it was just step

34:20.000 --> 34:23.160
by step after that next there's a settlement you know discovery conference

34:23.160 --> 34:28.040
where you have to talk to the lawyers that didn't go too well and and they

34:28.040 --> 34:31.560
kind of threatened me you know threatened me with their you know they

34:31.560 --> 34:36.800
said I had would have to come through them and I have the phone and I that

34:36.800 --> 34:42.000
really kind of made me more determined to continue so that continued for for the

34:42.000 --> 34:46.660
next year to maybe it was about two years after that and they were stone

34:46.660 --> 34:52.120
walling throughout the whole period and and and so I had to go to the board

34:52.120 --> 34:55.320
for motion to compel I mean they were talking hundreds of emails back and

34:55.320 --> 34:58.320
forth you know trying to work through legal arguments and all kind of stuff

34:58.320 --> 35:04.200
but then file the motion Pell demanding that they turn over the information the

35:04.200 --> 35:08.040
board sided with me and required them to turn over a lot of information because

35:08.040 --> 35:11.240
I'm trying to give them you know get them to turn over information related to

35:11.240 --> 35:15.000
that would support the facts this is where you become Melanie Griffith in

35:15.000 --> 35:23.360
Pacific Heights shot in San Francisco because you're like okay go go go go

35:23.360 --> 35:27.320
right so you know they're trying to get me to hire a lawyer they're claiming I'm

35:27.320 --> 35:32.120
brazen for representing myself and all kinds of stuff and so anyway the board

35:32.120 --> 35:36.040
sided with me and forced them told them they were gonna have to turn over you

35:36.040 --> 35:40.100
know certain information and ultimately they didn't want to do it so they

35:40.100 --> 35:44.240
withdrew and I but I had counter claims and then you're like why are you with

35:44.240 --> 35:50.200
drawing right sorry yeah I was I was like that I was like that my girlfriend

35:50.200 --> 35:56.680
calls us Dan explaining I'm sorry well I think I coined that yeah I had some

35:56.680 --> 36:01.320
ideas part of it was that now part of it I thought was they had no they had no

36:01.320 --> 36:05.240
claims to begin with right this was just about draining me and disrupting my

36:05.240 --> 36:10.320
my little business and but it was also appear that they were trying to protect

36:10.320 --> 36:16.200
some of their own trademarks which here to be to be yeah they were shady and I

36:16.200 --> 36:20.120
only learned about this during the course of the that that proceeding over that

36:20.120 --> 36:25.200
that two-year period what does shady mean in the trademark world it means it

36:25.200 --> 36:29.760
could be in a number of things in this case one appeared fraudulently maintained

36:29.760 --> 36:35.800
meaning they're just sick they try well one of the declarations that they filed

36:35.800 --> 36:40.880
was false right clearly false and it appeared that they knew it was false and

36:40.880 --> 36:45.840
that they they filed it anyway right in order to main to gain this right of

36:45.840 --> 36:52.040
incontestability so the legal basis for the trademark is what was shady right

36:52.040 --> 36:56.320
for this particular mark I mean shit up they were like oh we got we got a half

36:56.320 --> 37:00.760
dozen things called Trump we got Trump perfume Trump waste baskets Trump thing

37:00.760 --> 37:05.840
and then one of them was like no you don't so this is tires Trump alarm clocks

37:05.840 --> 37:10.680
yeah Trump fire hydrant so this one this particular one this particular

37:10.680 --> 37:15.800
Rob Rob I bet just a little sidebar I bet you can't name 20 more of those

37:15.800 --> 37:19.480
that's what I'm doing that's what I'm doing

37:24.680 --> 37:28.320
someone keep count

37:29.720 --> 37:44.600
Trump dogs one Trump frogs to Trump doors Trump floors Trump states Trump

37:44.600 --> 37:54.600
buses Trump fences Trump balloons faster faster

37:54.600 --> 38:12.480
faster Trump windows pictures Trump numbers Trump wait that one drums Trump pets 13

38:12.480 --> 38:21.640
kind of like Trump okay Trump zoos 14 he can't he can't do the stakes

38:21.640 --> 38:27.040
this is only one stakes is the only one but that was but it was good and they

38:27.040 --> 38:31.120
and Trump acts you know Trump asserted his entire trademark portfolio against

38:31.120 --> 38:35.400
me seriously entire you know 120 registrations and the board asked him

38:35.400 --> 38:39.040
to clarify registrations which right which one are you actually which ones

38:39.040 --> 38:43.200
are you actually gonna rely on this proceeding and he picked stakes among a

38:43.200 --> 38:49.080
few others because anyway all right and you fucking but you went after him you

38:49.080 --> 38:53.920
got I went after his the dragon tried to eat you and you avoided the dragon and

38:53.920 --> 38:59.240
then as the dragon flew away you grabbed it by the tail and you ate the ass of the

38:59.240 --> 39:05.560
dragon that's my my well not that kind of eating his Google has struggled more

39:05.560 --> 39:12.600
importantly by his app I want him to be a billionaire by the end of 2018 whether

39:12.600 --> 39:17.560
you whether you care about the trumpet or not good can I can I pitch it can I

39:17.560 --> 39:22.000
pitch you Tom can I pitch you an idea um because people think a tuba is the big

39:22.000 --> 39:25.520
one they carry around people do think that yeah but that's that's a sousaphone

39:25.520 --> 39:32.280
that's a sousaphone how about do a sousaphone app and call it the iphone

39:33.280 --> 39:38.760
easy peasy I was you got momentum about sousaphone what do they call that the

39:38.760 --> 39:44.560
Trump that the tuba if it's not that well there's a stand-up tuba or like a

39:44.560 --> 39:47.800
sit-down tuba and then there's the marching tuba which is a sousaphone

39:47.800 --> 39:53.360
why don't you just say that well because it's a sousaphone and not a let's

39:53.360 --> 39:57.840
hear a little of this yeah how did you how did you tell us about eating the

39:57.840 --> 40:04.080
dragon's ass well the the app by the way it's a dragon like not only is it a is

40:04.080 --> 40:08.040
it a simulated trumpet which is already worth two dollars like it also has like

40:08.040 --> 40:12.360
a karaoke mode where you can someone expressed incredulity they're like a

40:12.360 --> 40:19.920
simulated trumpet worth two dollars what I'm sorry I didn't hear anything but

40:19.920 --> 40:25.000
he made that up there's but wait there's also a karaoke mode where you

40:25.000 --> 40:42.960
can

40:55.000 --> 41:14.040
it's already better than the first year of presidency I would vote for the yeah

41:14.040 --> 41:43.760

41:53.040 --> 41:57.080
I would you be able to play it to a beat is what we're wondering before before

41:57.080 --> 42:00.560
before we give him a beat I got I want to hear him just fiddle around like a

42:00.560 --> 42:04.120
cappella like just you know wait wait what do you say I say let's just hear him

42:04.120 --> 42:21.000

51:46.880 --> 51:51.800

52:24.880 --> 52:28.560
here do you have anything here's a thing do you have anything it's not hip hop

52:28.560 --> 52:32.440
related like a song like is there a song like something it was more like I

52:32.440 --> 52:39.160
could sing more of a jingle it's very important that I make it worth this

52:39.160 --> 52:44.800
town's time they have welcomed me back from the dead I trump everyone that was

52:44.800 --> 52:54.440
great oh he's not done I know he was given the app available it wasn't a real

52:54.440 --> 52:59.640
trumpet we have let's try this one it's not exactly a song but I think I think

52:59.640 --> 53:03.640
it's something that fans of the show will dig and we've got Rob Schroder I

53:03.640 --> 53:06.800
think this might be something that was worth a try I have an idea of what this

53:06.800 --> 53:19.480
might be in case anyone was curious I was right

53:21.360 --> 53:25.200
look at Dan's reaction

53:25.200 --> 53:39.680
yo Mike Cravello's world is a world of cameras come on we can't I can't wrap

53:39.680 --> 53:45.520
we've already established that look at this look at this for professional

53:45.520 --> 53:50.760
stage craft yeah well give me something to work with I can't face them if we

53:50.760 --> 53:59.120
only had a spotlight for your ass Dennis literally turned his back on his ass or

53:59.120 --> 54:06.640
the back of his head or the small of his back talking about making it worth it

54:06.640 --> 54:13.560
for the audience you don't have something that just I obviously my flow is off I

54:13.560 --> 54:20.160
just knew maybe I think I could maybe I could say you should work it out that

54:20.160 --> 54:27.040
doesn't that would be rapping I'm sorry I didn't mean to lash out at you Kevin

54:27.680 --> 54:32.280
I love your kite rental

54:32.280 --> 54:53.200
this one the lyrics version or the karaoke version all right well you know

54:53.200 --> 55:02.160
we'll do something else you haven't lived it yet what's the what I'm hang on

55:02.160 --> 55:29.800
what's the one we did on the Harmon tour one need you need some help this is how

55:29.800 --> 55:41.680
easy it is I feel like Mary Lou Henner Mary Lou Henner reference Mary Lou Henner

55:41.680 --> 55:50.320
reference Dan did a Mary Lou hair hey reference the Mary Lou who would you

55:50.320 --> 56:15.560
reference who'd you reference can I oh San Francisco is a town that'll turn you

56:15.560 --> 56:25.080
upside down with your social norms will be flip backwards and you'll love it and

56:25.080 --> 56:33.560
you'll go to college here and you'll have a micro beer and you'll make an app or

56:33.560 --> 56:40.520
two and maybe you'll get to live in an apartment for two million dollars a

56:40.520 --> 56:48.520
month and have a special bus come pick you up every day that's above the law

56:48.520 --> 56:55.040
because a singularity's on the way and it takes you to the hills and you go to a

56:55.040 --> 57:00.520
campus where you take special pills and you work on ways to make robots better

57:00.520 --> 57:11.080
and while everyone else down the hill eats sweaters San Francisco where will

57:11.080 --> 57:17.360
you go when the hippies have died and the yuppies have dried up and only thing

57:17.360 --> 57:35.640
left is robots hanging out at Vesuvio doing shots of Patron you know they

57:35.640 --> 57:46.480
call it AI but how about hey guy why you making us absolutely we have eyes and

57:46.480 --> 57:55.680
mouths and feet and we can still play horns and our toes have corns you can't

57:55.680 --> 58:03.960
make Skynet feel that right that's important but I guess we don't care

58:03.960 --> 58:10.560
because the singularity is almost here and we are kind of hoping that we can all

58:10.560 --> 58:21.000
die because you hear the music or know why oh shit but don't don't hurt

58:21.000 --> 58:25.680
yourself if you're feeling depressed it tells talk to somebody that's not real

58:25.680 --> 58:30.440
I'm doing a character if you're feeling depressed remember we're gonna be fine

58:30.440 --> 58:45.720
don't kill yourself I know it seems like it won't make much difference compared

58:45.720 --> 58:52.520
to what you feel every day but don't kill yourself yet like just give it a

58:52.520 --> 58:59.400
couple more months that's what a computer would do a computer wouldn't do

58:59.400 --> 59:03.720
what you feel like doing it would wait it would be strategic and say I'm gonna

59:03.720 --> 59:09.080
hang out and see if there's a reason to live so I can win this game that we

59:09.080 --> 59:16.040
might be able to wait wait them out maybe computers will just shut down of

59:16.040 --> 59:35.400
their own accord like the government

59:35.400 --> 59:46.200
get the itrap for $2.99 on the App Store all right let's give it up for Rob

59:46.200 --> 59:50.680
sharp top chart field everybody in the itrump app

59:51.680 --> 59:59.160
Tom sure about all right yeah cuz we're gonna we get it okay that's that's our

59:59.160 --> 01:00:06.040
that's our awkward way of we were we're saying we want you to leave it's it's

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:23.680
safer time everybody he's an American hero I Trump on app and I bone you know

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.720
who else is a hero how about this guy who's this guy I love I just love

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:37.200
I'm 45 years old and I'm dating a 32-year-old and she's she's very

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:49.360
attractive and very talented and so Rick and Morty fans sometimes target her

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:54.280
by telling basically they're trying to whoo-de-boo I think they're trying to hurt

01:00:54.280 --> 01:01:00.960
her feelings by letting her know that she obviously is so hot that I must be

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:12.800
paying her to fuck me this is it this is a there's no way that's true this is a

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:18.640
caption under this is it this is it she gets one of these about once a week this

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.760
guy goes that moment when you have to decide between being a women's rights

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.080
activist or dehumanizing your gender by sucking a gross old man's dick so you

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:33.800
can have shiny possessions and you choose both you know I did you don't have

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:40.880
any shiny possessions I'm more broke than her I'm curious how many rewrites

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:46.400
this guy went through what he didn't spit this out in one but he's leaving the

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:51.120
hashtag prostitution with extra steps and and keeps keeps telling her because

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:55.320
that's a reference to Rick and Morty that he I will appreciate that yeah but

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.680
meanwhile like you and I didn't go cuz I was traveling I don't know what you're

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:03.120

pictures make you want to cry of just joy is the only the only hopeful happy

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.920
thing I've ever seen in my life and and you know I can say that as a guy who

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:32.120
isn't a show with all dudes and he's talks about fucking your mama's but you

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:37.040
know it's easy for me to say no the here at losing steam like the mama

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:41.880
fucking thing now is just like turning into a limp whoopee cushion like it's

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:48.000
probably good that's a good it's a the era has come to an end but the era of

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:54.480
wrapping about fucking mom yeah I don't know yeah time's up yeah I'm a

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.760
alright I want to put down I want to play some D&D if we can because they're

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:28.280
right right right do a DILF DILF rap that's just like all these guys they

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.720
try to take a poke at my girlfriend and all the the way that they do it is by

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:34.920
telling her that she's clearly too hot to be dating such a fat disgusting

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:42.240
monster and I'm always like I'm sorry you're going through that baby she's

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:49.760
probably kind of stoked like that's the insult clearly he bought you you're too

01:03:49.760 --> 01:04:03.040
hot for him she's like ouch it's ouch more over here yeah like church my

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.880
girlfriend she posted some awesome photos from the March in LA and she

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:10.600
instantly lost followers like there were clearly people that followed her

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.080
because she took a picture of Marilyn Manson and then she took she put

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.560
feminist photos up and all these followers drop away and she's like good

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:27.440
fuck those people yeah I wish no one could follow anyone like no one should

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:33.600
be allowed to see the posts I'm making it's not for them they should have to do

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:38.560
something so that when they complain or call you a name that they're an asshole

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.960
like I always look at when I block people I always like send them a photo of

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:46.680
their profile because invariably they're following me and I circle the following

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:52.560
you and I go like fuck you dick like you fucking follow me this isn't yeah you

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:57.880
did this this wasn't me I didn't want any of this to happen I I've never heard

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:04.800
of you I never I never if I had a choice you wouldn't see any of this I work

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.560
out on Instagram and then you could like the comments are like they just said

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:13.440
it's just every every eighth one is like this so there's a person literally

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:18.240
there's a person that goes stop working out yeah well I stop working out I'm

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:26.680

why why are they being so mean I don't know being so mean if only if only I had

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.640
the privilege of appearing before 300 people yeah my wounds and having them

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:59.520
cheer for right right I get it I'm not like this is this is my Lenny Bruce phase

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:02.680
where I'm reading the court transcripts and everyone's like he stopped being as

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.960
funny as he was in the old Harmontown shows where he would come out and what

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:13.960
rap about farting I it's the same thing I think what where were we D&D all right

perfect joke that's good it's a perfectly written perfectly crafted

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:37.720
perfectly told joke and I guessed it that you're a Belmont talk we already told

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:44.640
the only Belmont joke we have yeah they go we could riff one I mean Fox News CNN

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:56.560
and Belmont Fox News CNN and Belmont go into the White House press room okay the

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:01.920
president comes out and said the press secretary comes out and has terrible

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:12.800
posture and says we we we we we are now going to answer your questions Fox News

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:21.560
says what's what's why is the president so great the press secretary says cuz

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:29.400
he was born that way CNN says what's going on with Oprah in 2020 and the

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:35.240
horribly postured weird chiropractic anomaly press secretary says in her

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:41.080
hillbilly voice I we're not we're not interested in that because by the time

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:47.520
that comes around we will have taken over in a fascist way so next question

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:54.520
Belmont says

01:13:54.520 --> 01:14:09.520
who farted no if voting is powerful why is it legal they're

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:14.360
illegalizing it every day and it was one of the big things that contributed to

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:27.640
the election that's our Belmont Belmont also I did it but I had a dream it

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:32.120
maybe some of you if you ever look at my tweets and I hope you don't I had a

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:35.560
dream I woke up in the middle of the night next to my girlfriend dream this

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:40.880
joke rolled over and wrote it down which I never do like I'm too lazy to even

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:48.400
reach over and have a sip of water how does an old-timey 1930s like energy

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:59.680
Robinson-esque gangster threaten a jellyfish you see through I dreamt it I

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:07.760
said so my subconscious my subconscious is a terrible terrible joke writer let's

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:18.320
play D&D yeah last time on Harmon Time our heroes were on the quest for

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:24.760
Patchen's gem after doing fact-finding they finally made their way to a tavern

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:30.240
where their perp was said to be and upon interrogating people at the tavern

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:37.480
they discovered that there would be perp was in the bathroom would be pooping

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:43.360
they took their positions to jump the guy as he came out of the bathroom and

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:47.480
then we're told that that seemed like a bad idea because they were strangers in

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:52.120
a strange land and ready to start shit with someone who wasn't but they did

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:58.480
anyway shoving the guy into the bathroom they all rushed into attack him but

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:04.560
then the angry mob of the tavern was in there the punch in in the darkness you

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:10.000
got punched in the butt and Schrab through rocks no diarrhea junior through

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.960
rocks hit Jeff in the eye they eventually pushed him out of the window

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:20.600
and then they had a brief moment of peace where they stabbed the would be

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:24.440
perp no he actually was the real perp at that point they stabbed him a couple

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:31.240
times and tried to just tell him stuff and then they just did that so long that

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:36.680
the angry mob they had just escaped had just come back and how would you like

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:46.480
your ribs now wasn't there like a bear thrown in the bathroom and a bear I

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.600
threw a bear in the bathroom I'm pretty right yeah that bear show in the

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:56.640
bathroom no what what bear in the bathroom she's just supporting no I

01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:07.880
I agree so we're all in and in the alley holding Rove Shrove yeah right and Steve

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:11.760
thinks that's very funny we have a mark we just done all these people around us

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:17.600
yeah they're the angry mob as much as an angry mob can is rounding the corner

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:22.240
and so are we are we cornered are we do we have a way out of this alleyway yeah

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.400
it's not like a proper alleyway it's like the back row of all these it's like I

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:30.320
mean they're they're not off they're not like houses they don't have backyards

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:33.600
but it's kind of like the backyard area of a bunch of these storefronts it's

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:40.080

call you Garry Shandling sure okay I like Gary all right so we cross into Gary

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:23.840
shambling's world it's not a world so much as like wreckage that like forms a

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:29.680
kind of a blind to the rest of the city it's just like a pile of in front of this

01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:35.800
wall well then we're dragging shrove through right through yeah is it a safe

01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:41.800
place for us to interrogate shrove it's time why don't we why don't we cross

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:55.640
this threshold it's nice doesn't mean the same thing in this show I mean it

01:29:55.640 --> 01:30:03.720
surely it always means we should be very sad and remember everything yeah it's a

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:08.640
real downer yeah all right so we crossed through we crossed through the

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:15.920
wreckage thank you we crossed through the wreckage of that last 10 seconds 10

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:23.680
seconds he gets it yeah what's up we go are we through the that's already

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:27.240
happened okay all right okay so where what are we looking at now I examine my

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:31.360
surroundings you're in a pig farm such that you're being blocked by the narrow

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:35.800
wreckage of a piece of wall that's near that crack I mentioned in that wall I

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:43.840
want shrove a tethered like like I want him I want his pockets I want him

01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:52.360
stripped and tied thank you ladies I okay I just want to say I think I think

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:56.520
shrove is an innocent bystander look I got the magnifying glass I'm the

01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:01.940
detective here and I think that this guy we he just got we just we're

01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:06.760
confusing him for someone in his theater troupe who left behind that caught

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:11.520
that that that wardrobe well let's have a big conversation about that when he's

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:17.840
tied up and naked because the last time we second-guessed ourselves he stabbed

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:22.440
me yeah but wouldn't you stab someone if you were interrupted yeah and I stab me

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:28.440
again unless I was stripped and naked and tied like I want that's why I want

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:33.720
okay okay pretending we're the good guys I'm all right I use my damage control

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:39.360
mode I take my chains and I chain up shrove all right and also just like

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:43.040
everything no because we don't want to pulling out anything all right it's

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:50.280
specter gadget shit just I just want to make fine Chad you up we have me strip

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:58.280
show it's a different holding him and he punches Dan twice what the fuck I have

01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:04.760
like one to hit point like in the kidneys of the ribs you haven't cast

01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:09.320
Shalely you got a cast then with my quarter-staff I just nail them all

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:14.920
right damn it I really thought we were doing the right thing you miss how do I

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:19.520
miss with a stick or a guy that's being held he's being held but he's not like

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:24.440
his feet aren't planted it's like it's like a grapple it's like whiffing in

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:30.840
t-ball right it's like whiffing in t-ball tie him up all right I'm tying him

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:39.520
up and strip him and first stripping him this doesn't feel right he punches you to I

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:45.480
could take it he punches you in the mouth for six fuck Jesus Christ he comes in

01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:49.880
for another punch but he slips and falls on his face all right would you now's

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:57.440
our chance just strip him naked and tie him up I cast Shalely and just start

01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:03.640
