is\n\n18:02.480 --> 18:18.720\nthat okay is it all right anytime it's not even making sound what is he do is\n\n18:18.720 --> 18:26.480\nthis insane I feel like Jane Goodall what am I like I like I feel like I'm\n\n18:26.480 --> 18:31.960\ntrying to just get everyone to have tea with me and then I'll then I'll be like\n\n18:31.960 --> 18:34.960\nI thought you were setting me up I thought you were setting me up once\n\n18:34.960 --> 18:42.600\nupon a time there was a guy who was such a brass enthusiast that he's like I\n\n18:42.600 --> 18:48.880\nwant to share my brass enthusiasm with the world and this new technology comes\n\n18:48.880 --> 18:53.680\nalong oh you can make apps and he and he goes you know what I'm gonna I want\n\n18:53.680 --> 18:58.520\neveryone to learn the glory of the trumpet and I'm gonna make an app and I'm\n\n18:58.520 --> 19:06.560\ngonna call it I Trump because I trumpet is too long and then a guy started\n\n19:06.560 --> 19:15.440\nsuing him in 2011 named Donald Trump and long story short but let's hear the\n\n19:15.440 --> 19:23.360\nrest of the story this man Donald Trump spent a total of something like half a\n\n19:23.360 --> 19:29.320\ndecade trying to intimidate and sue this guy into non-existence just trying to\n\n19:29.320 --> 19:35.520\nget him to stop calling his app about trumpets I Trump this guy represented\n\n19:35.520 --> 19:48.480\nhimself in court and beat him and one please welcome Tom Scharfeld yeah the\n\n19:48.480 --> 19:59.080\nSan Francisco spirit embodied I don't know was that a good introduction or was\n\n19:59.080 --> 20:07.520\nthat like weird can we can we help you out do that all yeah can we lower your\n\n20:07.520 --> 20:18.160\nstool but yeah I mean I'm I'm getting your story sloppy but there are parts\n\n20:18.160 --> 20:30.000\nthat are very fascinating about it first of all you got to hit it my favorite\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:35.680\npart of it is that you're not you you're not who's the most hurt you're not\n\n20:35.680 --> 20:41.160\nHerb Alpert that's a famous trumpet guy right you're not like you never said\n\n20:41.160 --> 20:44.240\nthat you were you're not like I'm the best trumpet player the world you love\n\n20:44.240 --> 20:55.680\nlike right you have an app called I bone for trombone I'm not laughing they\n\n20:55.680 --> 20:59.320\nlaughed but they also applaud because they love you something I'm a trombone\n\n20:59.320 --> 21:02.160\nplayer I've been playing trombone my whole life well you got to eat that Mike\n\n21:02.160 --> 21:08.160\nimagine it's an instrument okay I'm a trombone player for the record and I've\n\n21:08.160 --> 21:13.240\nbeen playing pretty much my whole life and but Miles Davis is one of my big\n\n21:13.240 --> 21:18.600\nidols so I love trumpet and and so he's like the Herb Alpert of trumpet players\n\n21:18.600 --> 21:22.240\nI like her about her as well you guys don't realize Miles Davis was just\n\n21:22.240 --> 21:27.240\nouted called out yesterday at a different podcast so so what was the\n\n21:27.240 --> 21:38.200\noriginal question I continue sorry I'm I'm being a petty vandal I'm angry go\n\n21:38.200 --> 21:44.840\nahead okay no could you remind you of what we're talking about yeah no I said\n\n21:44.840 --> 21:49.000\nyou you had a you had a I bone app right and I'm right now I'm not being a\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:53.920\nloof I'm pulling up your app okay yeah so I bone was my first iPhone app it was\n\n21:53.920 --> 21:56.480\nreally an experiment but it was something that I knew because I've been\n\n21:56.480 --> 21:59.760\nplaying trombone my whole life and I launched you know I worked on it for a\n\n21:59.760 --> 22:03.400\nfew months and got it out this was back in 2009 launch and it was it was a\n\n22:03.400 --> 22:07.600\nsuccess you know I got some good feedback and and then I you know I got to\n\n22:07.600 --> 22:11.080\nwork on a trumpet pretty much right away and you know a lot of work designing it\n\n22:11.080 --> 22:13.640\ntrying to get the interface right because I was trying to make something\n\n22:13.640 --> 22:16.280\nplayable and intuitive for real players you know something you could actually\n\n22:16.280 --> 22:22.280\nuse as a practice to learn from and was and so so the the trombone was your\n\n22:22.280 --> 22:25.080\nfavorite thing but like you you felt like you nailed it and then you're like\n\n22:25.080 --> 22:29.160\nI'm gonna move on to the other instrument right so I'll call it I Trump this is\n\n22:29.160 --> 22:36.040\n2011 right so then something comes in the mail yeah so pretty much I launched it\n\n22:36.040 --> 22:42.920\nmaybe I can provide some soundtrack for this story so I yes yeah so launched it\n\n22:42.920 --> 22:46.880\nin January 2011\n\n22:48.120 --> 22:52.320\nit's you those of you listening I'm providing that soundtrack with this\n\n22:52.320 --> 23:01.480\namazing $2 app yeah it's not a real trumpet I am very very affordable\n\n23:01.480 --> 23:08.000\ncompared to the price of fascism sorry yeah continue so I launched it at the\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:11.520\nNAMM show I don't know if you know the NAMM show it's a big music merchandising\n\n23:11.520 --> 23:18.800\nshow in Anaheim and we all we're all very familiar with yeah so there's a\n\n23:18.800 --> 23:23.840\nbiggest trade show in Anaheim but 80,000 people or something so anyway you don't\n\n23:23.840 --> 23:27.120\nhave to sell it it was a good launch it was a good launch after two years into\n\n23:27.120 --> 23:31.040\na good launch it was in USA today and then two weeks later I got a cease and\n\n23:31.040 --> 23:39.800\ndesist letter from Donald Trump and and on say well I got the letter all right\n\n23:39.800 --> 23:45.400\nso you get the letter and it says stop stop calling your app I Trump right so\n\n23:45.400 --> 23:56.480\nmy boss I'm a lawyer from Dewey Cheetahman Howe and I I stopped calling it\n\n23:56.480 --> 24:00.680\nI Trump you know there's only one Trump and anyone that's ever gonna call\n\n24:00.680 --> 24:06.440\nsomething I Trump is the big big buster himself okay so you read that letter\n\n24:06.440 --> 24:11.160\nright and he claimed compute he had some computer games and he claimed that he\n\n24:11.160 --> 24:16.800\nclaimed he had computer games and iPhone apps and he claimed that he that I was\n\n24:16.800 --> 24:21.000\ntrading off of goodwill that he had generated he thought you were writing on\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:27.400\nthe back of the popularity of Donald Trump in 2011 yes with your app about\n\n24:27.400 --> 24:34.320\nTrump yes yes and he claimed that you know it's sorry Trump it's known as\n\n24:34.320 --> 24:42.080\nso yeah he claimed it was it's it's known as a horn and not a Trump and and so\n\n24:42.080 --> 24:52.440\nanyway I that was the that's their argument it's yeah the instrument you're\n\n24:52.440 --> 24:57.080\ndescribing is not called a Trump my boss is called a truck it's known as a horn\n\n24:57.080 --> 25:02.800\nanyway basically all brass instruments and no no horns anyway so I got the\n\n25:02.800 --> 25:06.560\nletter and I I honestly thought it was it felt like some kind of you know it\n\n25:06.560 --> 25:11.080\nfelt like April Fool's or something so I actually I saw it on my phone and I\n\n25:11.080 --> 25:15.200\nlaid down on my bed and pulled the computer up just you know to take some\n\n25:15.200 --> 25:19.960\ntime to read it and then I the first thing I did was to actually go to the\n\n25:19.960 --> 25:24.280\nlawyer lawyer's webpage to make sure it was a legitimate like a real firm you\n\n25:24.280 --> 25:30.200\nknow that might be your friend yeah I was out of you know completely out of\n\n25:30.200 --> 25:35.120\nthis world it was I so I wasn't I wasn't afraid right I was really just more\n\n25:35.120 --> 25:39.680\nshocked right I mean you know it just didn't seem real right at this point I\n\n25:39.680 --> 25:45.960\njust want to interject how is your eye bone money like keeping you afloat like\n\n25:45.960 --> 25:50.360\nare you I just want to get a get a sense of like are you in a one bedroom\n\n25:50.360 --> 25:55.880\napartment a two bedroom apartment are you are you married are you a trust fund\n\n25:55.880 --> 26:01.320\nguy are you you know we want to feel your protagonist so I started doing apps\n\n26:01.320 --> 26:09.400\nlike when I was 29 30 and I had saved the money you know before and then I\n\n26:09.400 --> 26:12.640\nstarted working on some different projects which didn't make a lot of money\n\n26:12.640 --> 26:18.320\nI've only made you know some money you know and but it's volatile you know it\n\n26:18.320 --> 26:21.960\ndoesn't just last you have to continue to develop and to promote it you weren't\n\n26:21.960 --> 26:29.800\nsitting on a war chest but no one here is sitting on a watch but but but but I\n\n26:29.800 --> 26:33.880\nreally believe in my products you know and I really have you know how to hope\n\n26:33.880 --> 26:37.840\nand dream this is why I love you this is why you're a hero okay because you're\n\n26:37.840 --> 26:42.360\npassionate about fucking brass instruments yeah well which is the\n\n26:42.360 --> 26:47.240\nopposite of Donald Trump and he's not passionate about anything so I worked on\n\n26:47.240 --> 26:50.120\nproducts that I haven't been that passionate about and when I started\n\n26:50.120 --> 26:53.880\nworking on on projects that I was passionate about it was like you know\n\n26:53.880 --> 26:58.160\nit's something amazing what are the products you weren't passionate about I\n\n26:58.160 --> 27:10.240\nmean I mean maybe we die he's yeah I mean I salad just one well I mean the\n\n27:10.240 --> 27:14.560\none I did immediately prior to I bone was that was a service called whoop tones\n\n27:14.560 --> 27:21.600\nwhoop tones oh that sounds familiar and I loved I'm sorry I was passionate about\n\n27:21.600 --> 27:29.200\nit for a while but then the meaning wasn't there you know so the product\n\n27:29.200 --> 27:34.320\nwhat it did was spark goes out sometimes it was basically pre-smartphone it\n\n27:34.320 --> 27:39.320\nallowed you to call people and play sound effects during the phone call and I\n\n27:39.320 --> 27:45.680\nlike that all right I mean you can't do that when I may you know I could like a\n\n27:45.680 --> 27:50.440\nsound board like I could call Jeff and go like hey man do you want to hang out\n\n27:50.440 --> 27:56.920\nand then press a button you could and you exactly yeah so the model the\n\n27:56.920 --> 28:02.040\nslogan was it was whoop tones press one to fart was the slogan that's the slogan\n\n28:02.040 --> 28:07.120\nof the company whoop Jones press one to fart right okay but but you could\n\n28:07.120 --> 28:14.960\nactually take the sounds and you are that's from 2005 it was launched it's\n\n28:14.960 --> 28:20.800\nstill 2005 farts Dan but are you picking up emotionally and the fact that you\n\n28:20.800 --> 28:28.320\nare the hero that we've always wanted but anyway you could play scenes to you\n\n28:28.320 --> 28:31.520\nknow backgrounds that would loop to create the impression you're elsewhere\n\n28:31.520 --> 28:36.880\nyou could do that too oh like so you could do like a foggy harbor in London\n\n28:36.880 --> 28:45.680\nyeah like hey I can't make it to work my ship is Pat Paddington is lost a bunch\n\n28:45.680 --> 28:50.560\nof typewriters and people talking right now I got a big story coming out right\n\n28:50.560 --> 28:57.240\nnow it's in there that's what is the office okay but anyway so I worked on\n\n28:57.240 --> 29:04.080\nit for two years and I just really didn't get anywhere and and I so I started\n\n29:04.080 --> 29:08.480\nto lose the passion for it and and you know part of it was the meaning for me\n\n29:08.480 --> 29:11.560\nwasn't there you know it wasn't something I could go back to my child and\n\n29:11.560 --> 29:17.560\nlatch on to you know but the trombone was when you're in school was that your\n\n29:17.560 --> 29:21.760\nfirst instrument in school yeah you know my my you know idols Miles Davis JJ\n\n29:21.760 --> 29:25.920\nJohnson trombone player but but but it's something that really meant something\n\n29:25.920 --> 29:30.720\nand so if I could do something for those kids or the ex-players that are you know\n\n29:30.720 --> 29:35.080\nthe seniors and whatever deprived of music budgets and there's so the meaning\n\n29:35.080 --> 29:39.000\nwas there and is there a market I didn't know but but it was it was an\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.760\nexperiment you know it was a way to learn how to build an app it was my first\n\n29:41.760 --> 29:47.520\napp and but because I knew I knew I knew what the trombone what I knew how I\n\n29:47.520 --> 29:50.600\nwould design it immediately it was just about trying to figure out how to build\n\n29:50.600 --> 29:54.400\nthe app you know but when I started to get good feedback you know I just kept\n\n29:54.400 --> 30:00.320\non going yeah yeah so that you're like yeah let's the the I bone didn't make you\n\n30:00.320 --> 30:06.040\na billionaire it gave you an emotional cue that you're like I should keep\n\n30:06.040 --> 30:10.480\nfollowing this path of bliss yeah but I am going to now do the right I could see\n\n30:10.480 --> 30:16.240\na path to maybe not billions but maybe millions seriously yeah I could see it\n\n30:16.240 --> 30:20.800\nbut at any rate yeah like oh like that your your job had had coincided with your\n\n30:20.800 --> 30:24.480\nfulfillment and you're like right I Trump right and so that's what I was kind\n\n30:24.480 --> 30:30.000\nof going for the letter the guy goes I'm Trump I will be I Trump I'm gonna be I\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:36.560\nTrump and then so then here's the part where you become a god because you don't\n\n30:36.560 --> 30:47.440\ngo oh shit Trump is suing me I'll just do the I flute you represent yourself and\n\n30:47.440 --> 30:53.920\njust go through this process that takes forever and the whole time I'm not I\n\n30:53.920 --> 30:57.440\ndon't want to put words in your mouth like you're you had to go through this\n\n30:57.440 --> 31:02.880\nwhole thing you know it was never you in court next to him it was just people and\n\n31:02.880 --> 31:09.400\nprobably mostly paperwork right but yeah I mean so you know it's a long process\n\n31:09.400 --> 31:12.840\nand you know I just kind of took it step-by-step and I didn't really know\n\n31:12.840 --> 31:16.240\nwhat I was getting into but you know when it starts with something that's\n\n31:16.240 --> 31:20.560\nridiculous I mean that's what it seemed like to me if somebody goes like hey you\n\n31:20.560 --> 31:26.840\nover there that's my name right it's my property I was being mugged by like him\n\n31:26.840 --> 31:29.880\nhe himself you know it's like you're out in the street in New York and he comes\n\n31:29.880 --> 31:33.400\nout of nowhere and robs you yeah I mean that's what it felt like yeah and like\n\n31:33.400 --> 31:40.080\nyou know what am I supposed like you're little Bruce Wayne and your\n\n31:40.080 --> 31:43.200\nparents are coming out of the opera house and then a fucking dude that's even\n\n31:43.200 --> 31:52.920\nricher than them is like it's right I want everyone's not real people I'll\n\n31:52.920 --> 31:58.680\ngrow to produce tragedies real Rob and you're laughing but that's what it felt\n\n31:58.680 --> 32:04.400\nlike and that feeling persisted right for years and and so anyway you know I\n\n32:04.400 --> 32:08.160\ncontinue I checked it out I you know I asked them lawyers you know what they\n\n32:08.160 --> 32:10.800\nthought about it just to you know for reality check to make sure I'm you know\n\n32:10.800 --> 32:14.720\nI knew a little bit because I'd gone trademarks to the office but I got a\n\n32:14.720 --> 32:20.560\nreality check and I guess that's supposed to sound like a road of trials\n\n32:20.560 --> 32:28.120\nbeat but I have a quick question yeah did so when you were developing I Trump\n\n32:28.120 --> 32:34.400\ndid any point in your mind were you like going it kind of sounds like like that\n\n32:34.400 --> 32:39.320\nDonald Trump guy like we did you did that ever cross your mind it never did\n\n32:39.320 --> 32:44.680\nbecause this was you know 2011 like oh is that the guy from Home Alone 2 right\n\n32:44.680 --> 32:49.000\nno it's that's the guy that's the birther conspiracy guy yeah the guy from\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:53.520\nthe guy that's been trying to run for president for 35 years basically in\n\n32:53.520 --> 32:57.760\nsecrecy because no one cared yeah I know it never crossed my mind not once and\n\n32:57.760 --> 33:01.640\nthat's that's why that letter was so you know and there's another threshold you\n\n33:01.640 --> 33:07.640\ncross this is what's important is that you you defeat this and you do it\n\n33:07.640 --> 33:11.480\nrepresenting yourself they got their lawyers they're hoping you're gonna get\n\n33:11.480 --> 33:16.600\nscared go bankrupt you stick to it you reach a point where you have the right\n\n33:16.600 --> 33:24.680\nto do your thing but then you okay so like every hero okay so so and then\n\n33:24.680 --> 33:28.400\nthat's after the litigation started the following year as I continued to use the\n\n33:28.400 --> 33:33.800\napp and continue to sell it and everything and and and so the litigation\n\n33:33.800 --> 33:38.480\nyou know that was I was gonna try to use a lawyer for that but but that fell\n\n33:38.480 --> 33:43.440\nthrough like the day before my my dad mysteriously the way litigation works\n\n33:43.440 --> 33:50.520\nhe died in a tuba accident like I won't get into it nine hookers nine Russian\n\n33:50.520 --> 33:55.880\nhookers fell on him from the top of a shitty building I don't know I don't\n\n33:55.880 --> 34:01.080\nknow what happened anyway it fell through and he was strangled with bad\n\n34:01.080 --> 34:07.800\nclothing and showed with an eatable steak sorry but so the one side you know\n\n34:07.800 --> 34:11.360\nthat the plaintiff files the complaint first you got 40 days to answer so it was\n\n34:11.360 --> 34:16.160\na couple days before the answer was due that that this fell through so I go I'm\n\n34:16.160 --> 34:20.000\nmyself and I do it myself for that and then that was you know it was just step\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:23.160\nby step after that next there's a settlement you know discovery conference\n\n34:23.160 --> 34:28.040\nwhere you have to talk to the lawyers that didn't go too well and and they\n\n34:28.040 --> 34:31.560\nkind of threatened me you know threatened me with their you know they\n\n34:31.560 --> 34:36.800\nsaid I had would have to come through them and I have the phone and I that\n\n34:36.800 --> 34:42.000\nreally kind of made me more determined to continue so that continued for for the\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:46.660\nnext year to maybe it was about two years after that and they were stone\n\n34:46.660 --> 34:52.120\nwalling throughout the whole period and and and so I had to go to the board\n\n34:52.120 --> 34:55.320\nfor motion to compel I mean they were talking hundreds of emails back and\n\n34:55.320 --> 34:58.320\nforth you know trying to work through legal arguments and all kind of stuff\n\n34:58.320 --> 35:04.200\nbut then file the motion Pell demanding that they turn over the information the\n\n35:04.200 --> 35:08.040\nboard sided with me and required them to turn over a lot of information because\n\n35:08.040 --> 35:11.240\nI'm trying to give them you know get them to turn over information related to\n\n35:11.240 --> 35:15.000\nthat would support the facts this is where you become Melanie Griffith in\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:23.360\nPacific Heights shot in San Francisco because you're like okay go go go go\n\n35:23.360 --> 35:27.320\nright so you know they're trying to get me to hire a lawyer they're claiming I'm\n\n35:27.320 --> 35:32.120\nbrazen for representing myself and all kinds of stuff and so anyway the board\n\n35:32.120 --> 35:36.040\nsided with me and forced them told them they were gonna have to turn over you\n\n35:36.040 --> 35:40.100\nknow certain information and ultimately they didn't want to do it so they\n\n35:40.100 --> 35:44.240\nwithdrew and I but I had counter claims and then you're like why are you with\n\n35:44.240 --> 35:50.200\ndrawing right sorry yeah I was I was like that I was like that my girlfriend\n\n35:50.200 --> 35:56.680\ncalls us Dan explaining I'm sorry well I think I coined that yeah I had some\n\n35:56.680 --> 36:01.320\nideas part of it was that now part of it I thought was they had no they had no\n\n36:01.320 --> 36:05.240\nclaims to begin with right this was just about draining me and disrupting my\n\n36:05.240 --> 36:10.320\nmy little business and but it was also appear that they were trying to protect\n\n36:10.320 --> 36:16.200\nsome of their own trademarks which here to be to be yeah they were shady and I\n\n36:16.200 --> 36:20.120\nonly learned about this during the course of the that that proceeding over that\n\n36:20.120 --> 36:25.200\nthat two-year period what does shady mean in the trademark world it means it\n\n36:25.200 --> 36:29.760\ncould be in a number of things in this case one appeared fraudulently maintained\n\n36:29.760 --> 36:35.800\nmeaning they're just sick they try well one of the declarations that they filed\n\n36:35.800 --> 36:40.880\nwas false right clearly false and it appeared that they knew it was false and\n\n36:40.880 --> 36:45.840\nthat they they filed it anyway right in order to main to gain this right of\n\n36:45.840 --> 36:52.040\nincontestability so the legal basis for the trademark is what was shady right\n\n36:52.040 --> 36:56.320\nfor this particular mark I mean shit up they were like oh we got we got a half\n\n36:56.320 --> 37:00.760\ndozen things called Trump we got Trump perfume Trump waste baskets Trump thing\n\n37:00.760 --> 37:05.840\nand then one of them was like no you don't so this is tires Trump alarm clocks\n\n37:05.840 --> 37:10.680\nyeah Trump fire hydrant so this one this particular one this particular\n\n37:10.680 --> 37:15.800\nRob Rob I bet just a little sidebar I bet you can't name 20 more of those\n\n37:15.800 --> 37:19.480\nthat's what I'm doing that's what I'm doing\n\n37:24.680 --> 37:28.320\nsomeone keep count\n\n37:29.720 --> 37:44.600\nTrump dogs one Trump frogs to Trump doors Trump floors Trump states Trump\n\n37:44.600 --> 37:54.600\nbuses Trump

know Trump asserted his entire trademark portfolio against\n\n38:31.120 --> 38:35.400\nme seriously entire you know 120 registrations and the board asked him\n\n38:35.400 --> 38:39.040\nto clarify registrations which right which one are you actually which ones\n\n38:39.040 --> 38:43.200\nare you actually gonna rely on this proceeding and he picked stakes among a\n\n38:43.200 --> 38:49.080\nfew
