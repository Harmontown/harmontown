{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:20.000\nThere we go, from Hollywood, California, a meltdown comic, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:39.000\nSpencer Crittenden, and the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:47.000\nHello. Hello. Thank you.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:51.000\nAll right. Well, we got a lot of show tonight. Not a lot of good show. I don't know that.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:57.000\nI'm just saying we got a lot of guests and things. I'm not saying, oh, it's going to be a great show.\n\n00:57.000 --> 01:00.000\nI don't want to make promises like that. But sometimes I say it's going to be a bad show,\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:04.000\nand then sometimes you feel like that's a good show. Who cares? You don't know.\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:08.000\nThere's a big portion of our audience who hates when we have guests.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:09.000\nOh, really? Yeah.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:12.000\nWhat are they called? The Tories or the Wigs?\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:14.000\nBull Moosers.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:19.000\nDo you basing this on talking to them at karaoke after the show?\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:22.000\nOr are you basing this on Reddit? Are you a Reddit lurker?\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:26.000\nI'm not a Reddit lurker. Some people say to me, oh, I love it when you have guests.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:29.000\nSome people say I hate when you have guests. I like it when it's just you, Dan, and Spencer.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:34.000\nYeah. I mean, you know, and sometimes if we don't have guests, it's a bad show,\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:38.000\nbecause I'm like, I don't have anything to talk about, and I'm sluggish.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:40.000\nSometimes if we do have guests, it's a good show because we do have guests.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:44.000\nSometimes if we don't have guests, it's a good show in spite of having no guests.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:46.000\nYou can live by the guest and die by the guest.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:50.000\nYeah. I mean, who knows? Sometimes people come up and we get to know them,\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:54.000\nand sometimes they're a big dud. Sometimes they're...\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:58.000\nSometimes the people in the live venue, sorry, that was probably...\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:00.000\nVod cannot spit, but...\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:04.000\nSometimes people in the live venue enjoy the people that come up\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:09.000\nand people that are listening at home are like, fuck that guy, I hate him.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:14.000\nBut let's... Well, let's spend this...\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:20.000\nLet's spend this personal time before we bring out our guests wisely.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:22.000\nI want to ask you a couple questions.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:26.000\nHmm. Oh, yeah. Okay.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:28.000\nYeah.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:30.000\nYou became kind of Bruce Willis there.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:34.000\nThere's a... Okay, so does anybody know anything about pee?\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:40.000\nWhen a pee coming out of a penis, a human male penis,\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:46.000\nthat twist right by the...\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:49.000\nIs that because, I'm imagining, I'm not a physicist,\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:55.000\nbut that's because it's shooting out at a high velocity in the shape of a wall,\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:58.000\nlike a vertical wall, and then gravity is doing its thing,\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:01.000\nand it's leveling out, and it's also, at the same time,\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:04.000\ncoalescing into a cylinder of pee.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:08.000\nI think there's kind of two streams that strike each other,\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:17.000\nand their combined force kind of sends them in a spiral around each other until they land.\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:20.000\nOr like one of those water fountains sometimes do it,\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:24.000\nwhere there's two separate holes and they kind of strike each other.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:29.000\nI assume it's to get more, you know, distance out of it.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:32.000\nHello, Spencer, how are you tonight?\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:35.000\nAre you saying that it's like the Coriolis effect?\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:39.000\nIt's absolutely the Coriolis effect.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:47.000\nThat people's men's pee out of their penises south of the equator spirals the other way\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:50.000\nbecause of the rotation of the Earth?\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:54.000\nYeah, when we were in Australia, it was like that.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:59.000\nWhen you guys, ladies forgive us for a moment,\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:06.000\nwhen you guys have the comings, you know, when you ejaculate,\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:15.000\nwhen you make your leavings, and then if you, let's say it's a hot summer day,\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:20.000\nand you're already tired, and so you just kind of like,\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:25.000\nyou don't do any self-care, you just sort of drift off to sleep,\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:30.000\nwhich I did once in my 20s when I was living in Koreatown,\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:33.000\nand I really just value my candor.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nNo, don't value it, hate me.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:40.000\nBut I remember, this is a sad chapter of my life,\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:46.000\nit was so fucking hot, and I lived in this little two-foot closet in our house in Koreatown,\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:50.000\nand I masturbated, and I just passed out on my bare mattress,\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:55.000\nand I had masturbated on to like a piece of newspaper,\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:58.000\nand I just put it over onto the side of my bed,\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:03.000\nand I just drifted into a semi-blissful, semi-chronically depressed, sad,\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:06.000\nlike, when do I have to move back to Milwaukee sleep?\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:13.000\nAnd I woke up, and there was just this carpet of ants, just like...\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:17.000\nAnd it just made me feel like I was in an Irish poem or something about,\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:22.000\nlike, that hoser song or whatever,\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:26.000\nand I went, after the insects have made their claim,\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:34.000\nafter the raven has wet his beak, I'll be home with you, I'll be home with you.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:37.000\nNow, I was just listening to Skulljuice with Dino's Temetopolis.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:38.000\nYeah, they were talking about that.\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nThey talk about the fact, I did not know this,\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:43.000\nthat if you leave your jizz rag out, the ants will come,\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:48.000\nand I did not know that ants love... come.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nI think the ants that we get a lot are like piss ants, right?\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:56.000\nThey love bathroom stuff, they eat piss, they drink piss.\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.000\nThey're a lot like Donald Trump in that way.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.000\nImagine being an ant.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:03.000\nWhat a life the ants life, you know?\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:06.000\nIt's like, we really have to ask ourselves,\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:10.000\nlike, what are we shooting for? No pun intended.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.000\nWe as primates are shooting for the ants,\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:15.000\nand the ants are there to gather it all\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:21.000\nand take every protein-charged flake back to their brood.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:24.000\nAnd they've been here since before the dinosaurs,\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nand so in some respects we're tempted to say,\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\noh, the ants have won, they've won.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:29.000\nIt's their planet, right?\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nBecause they're not going to go anywhere,\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:32.000\nand then we're going to come and go,\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.000\nbut we're going to come and then we're going to go.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:36.000\nBut like...\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:38.000\nCummings and leavings.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:41.000\nBut what kind of life is that?\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:42.000\nThat's not a life.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nI'd rather be a super intelligent monkey\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nthat just like rises up and spits in God's eye.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nThat's a good point, yeah.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:52.000\nIt's better to be a human than an ant.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:56.000\nI think it's a bold stance, but I agree.\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:01.000\nBut we're presenting a unified front here.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:05.000\nWe're the only animal that has a philosophy,\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:08.000\nan evolutionary strategy that is proofed\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:11.000\nagainst the death of this planet,\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:13.000\nand also one that is causing it.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:16.000\nBut we are the only ones, as I've said,\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nI don't see any big plans coming out of giraffes these days.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nThey ain't got no rocket ships,\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nand we're just saying we're the one animal\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:27.000\nthat actually theoretically you could blow up the whole planet,\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:30.000\nand we'd be like, over here, we're not there yet,\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nbut I'm just saying we should be proud of ourselves.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nWe shouldn't aspire to be ants.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nAnd when I look at our freeways\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nand our public schooling systems,\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nI think we're aspiring to be ants,\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:41.000\nand we shouldn't do that.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:42.000\nOur next guest...\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nDan, before you bring out a guest,\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nreal quick, point of order.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:48.000\nSpencer and I were talking about...\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.000\nI don't want to slow down the show.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nBefore we bring out our guest,\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nwe've been talking and we keep forgetting about it,\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nabout starting a new D&D campaign.\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:03.000\nLet's lay the groundwork right now\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:06.000\nfor getting this rolling,\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nbecause we have a million guests tonight.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nYou mean like in the interest of next week?\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:11.000\nYeah, next show.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:14.000\nLet's talk about how we proceed with this now,\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nso we're ready to start rocking on this as we go forward.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nAll right, well, one thing before that...\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nElectric Boogaloo!\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:24.000\nBecause I never really finished my thought.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:26.000\nI know people at home are like, oh, he never got there.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nSometimes if you're a guy,\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nand you do your thing,\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:34.000\nand then you don't do anything else,\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.000\nthen you forget.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nYou go to the bathroom and you go pee,\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:40.000\nand it's this amazing double,\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:47.000\nlike, Legolas' Elven Arrow thing.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nAnd you wait for it.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nYou're like, have you ever had that happen?\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nAnd then you're like, well, I'm not going to...\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:56.000\nIt's because it hurts to stop.\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.000\nI know, smallest violin in the world\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:01.000\nfor the half of the gender\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nthat's destroyed our species,\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nbut it hurts.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:06.000\nYou don't want to stop.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nSo you just kind of like,\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nyou try to push through it.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:11.000\nYou figure like, well, it's...\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:12.000\nWhy don't you give me a break?\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:14.000\nWhat could possibly be going on down there\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:16.000\nthat could keep these two streams separate?\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:18.000\nAnd so you put a little more pressure on it,\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nand then it's just like too dry,\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.000\nand it's just like going everywhere with a toilet.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nAnd I mean, it's pretty steadfast,\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:28.000\nthat I'm assuming it's just a little super glue\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:34.000\nthat you made in servicing that selfish gene.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:38.000\nSo you're talking about when you're close to coming,\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.000\nthen it's hard to pee?\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:41.000\nNo.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:42.000\nNo, he's saying...\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nAm I that bad at making that?\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:49.000\nNo, he's saying that there was still some left in there.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nAfterward.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.000\nYou come, and then you go to sleep.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:52.000\nAnd while you sleep, it dries.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.000\nSo you haven't done it, and then you go pee,\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nand the tip of your wiener,\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:59.000\nthe hole, I believe, is probably just glued in the middle.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nRight. Okay.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nNo, that's true.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nYeah.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nNo, I believe it.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:07.000\nI didn't want to...\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nI tried to be quaint with my language.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:13.000\nI didn't want to get all clinical and grody about it.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nI need that.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:16.000\nAll right.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:17.000\nSo talking about D&D,\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nwell, we have to decide like what character.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nI mean, I will throw that to you and Spencer.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:23.000\nLike, Spencer, what do you think?\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:24.000\nYeah.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:25.000\nYeah, what kind of characters do you want?\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nI'm thinking your guys are...\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:31.000\nyour emissaries of a church that is like going into strange lands.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:32.000\nWell, what's our platform?\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:33.000\nAre we doing Pathfinder?\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nLet's just do Pathfinder.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nOkay.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:37.000\nAre we allowed to?\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:38.000\nLike, see so why?\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:40.000\nOh, I talk to those guys.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:44.000\nI use my plus two cloak of charisma.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:48.000\nAnd also a scroll of fireball.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:50.000\nThat was great.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:51.000\nAll right.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:52.000\nOkay.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.000\nSo go on.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:55.000\nYou want us to be emissaries of what?\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:56.000\nYeah.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.000\nSo I don't want to tell the story of the story that I want to tell.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nBut yeah, you guys are your adventurers,\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:03.000\nbut you're from some sort of church.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nYou don't have to be like believers of the church.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:06.000\nYou could be like, you know,\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:09.000\nemployees or contract laborers from the church or something.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:14.000\nBut you're a team from the church.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:15.000\nYeah.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nSo it's like Book of Mormon.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:18.000\nYeah, that's what it's going to be.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:19.000\nBook of Mormon.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:22.000\nWell, I think I would like to be a very devout,\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:26.000\nI know I could be like a hit man hired by the church\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:29.000\nor a paladin that represents the church,\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:33.000\nbut it's all into, I think I would like to be,\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:37.000\nbecause I kind of, I think my thing would,\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:40.000\nI would like to be certain about things.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:43.000\nI would like to know exactly what I'm supposed to do.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:44.000\nI'm not saying from you,\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:47.000\nI just mean like I would like to play a character\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:50.000\nthat gives me the relaxing, refreshing thing\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:53.000\nof not being conflicted and confused.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:56.000\nAnd I'd like to like know like, oh, I have a religion.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nAnd I'd like to know what the tenets of that religion are.\n\n11:58.000 --> 11:59.000\nI mean, I'll make them up.\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:02.000\nBut if, you know, I'm not asking you to write me a religion.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:05.000\nI'm just saying like, I'd like to be a cleric.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:06.000\nYeah, okay, great.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:10.000\nA cleric of that church, right?\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.000\nOf that church that we're talking about.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:13.000\nYeah.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:15.000\nNow, is it possible to still be Chad the Fire Liker\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:16.000\nfrom the San Francisco show?\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:17.000\nYeah, definitely.\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:21.000\nOkay, but I was, in that show, I was an elf druid.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nBut I like your drawing that you made\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:24.000\nwhen he was a gnome druid.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nSure.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nSo I might modify and be the gnome druid version\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nof Chad the Fire Liker.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:30.000\nGreat.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nWhatever you like.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nI like that.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:33.000\nI like it a lot.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:34.000\nAll right.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:35.000\nOkay.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:36.000\nSo do you want to, you want to like,\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:39.000\nroll us like attributes and stats and things like that?\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nYeah, that might take a week or two or something.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:44.000\nBut also I think maybe we should make Steve Levy a character,\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nbut I could handle that off Mike maybe.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:47.000\nYeah, that's good.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:50.000\nAnd so then we just have three dudes, but here's the thing.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:54.000\nLike, like gender imbalance might,\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:58.000\nwith consistency might be better than like,\n\n12:58.000 --> 12:59.000\nwe used to have Aaron.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.000\nYeah.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:02.000\nWe could use, you know, but like,\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:05.000\nI think what we all agreed upon after a while is that\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:08.000\nthese things keep falling apart because we keep rotating.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nRight.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:10.000\nWe don't need, we don't need people.\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nWe want to have consistency.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:15.000\nWe want it to be like a, like a, like a radio show.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nAnd then it's like, oh, here's another chapter of this.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nAnd everybody that played last week played this week.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:20.000\nAnd so that we have that kind of consistency.\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:22.000\nIt's also very common for when people are missing,\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\njust to have them be missing.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nThat's, that's something that happens in games.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:26.000\nSo we just do that.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:29.000\nWell, but not if you didn't anticipate them being missing.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:30.000\nI don't know.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:33.000\nWe got, we got bogged down because sometimes Camille would not be here\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nand then Demorge would be here and then not be here.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:39.000\nAnd Curtis would, you know, like come and go and Aaron would come and go\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:45.000\nand then went because, so it's, I think it's hard to keep track\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:48.000\nof a weekly show when the, when the half the cast is never there.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:49.000\nSo.\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:50.000\nRight.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nYeah.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nWe had a golden age when it was just like a core.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:57.000\nSo like Steve could play a woman or I could play a woman, you know,\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:00.000\nbut it wouldn't be true balance in terms of casting,\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nbut it would be in terms of the mythology.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nWe could have like NPCs come up and be women or something.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:05.000\nIs that just pandering?\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:09.000\nI think it's like, like, well, well, just all right.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:10.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:11.000\nI brought it up.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nNo, that's the thing.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nI didn't want to buy it.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nWe have way too much show.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.000\nWay too much show.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:16.000\nToo much show.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:17.000\nBut we've talked about it.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:18.000\nNo, we're good.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:19.000\nIt's happening.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:20.000\nIt's moving forward.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:23.000\nOh, like as it stands right now, you and I have characters,\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\npossibly Steve Levy and that's moving forward.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:26.000\nYeah.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:27.000\nAll right.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:28.000\nNow let's figure out the rest.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:29.000\nLet's get on with the cavalcade of stars.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:30.000\nOkay.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:34.000\nOur first guest is a modern veteran of the television directing trenches.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:38.000\nHe's directed many, many episodes of Always Sunny.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nHe's done tons of acting, too.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nWe can talk to him about that.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:48.000\nBut the most noteworthy thing is his movie, Fist Fight, is coming out February 17th.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:51.000\nI think it's got Charlie Day and Ice Cube in it.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:54.000\nAnd let's bring him out my new friend, Richie Keen.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nDid I get that right?\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nFebruary 17th.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:11.000\nI'm so bummed I wasn't out here because you talked about two very important subjects.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:12.000\nYeah.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:17.000\nAnd you pivoted amazingly from pissing to D&D, back to the double stream, back to D&D.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nI'm passionate about both these issues.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nI'm an OG D&D.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:24.000\nI'm Gary Gygax, first edition D&D.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:29.000\nAnd ladies, for those of you who don't understand the double stream,\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:34.000\nthere's women who are always wondering what's happened in there.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nWhy can't you hit it?\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nYeah, they think we're...\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nThis is something that's not...\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:45.000\nYou kind of just took the hit for everyone and got it out into the world.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nI appreciate that.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:51.000\nBut I don't want to hide behind, oh, my dick was glued shut every time.\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:52.000\nRight.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:58.000\nWe're also weird, lazy giants that can't fucking keep it in the bowl.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nI feel like this could be your thing.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nThis could be a cause.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nYes, this could be your...\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nYou could really get in front of this.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:16.000\nI wonder if shorter men are more popular with women in terms of toiletry and hygiene.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:22.000\nIf a girl went out with a seven-foot guy and then goes out with a five-foot-five guy,\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:25.000\nif she's like, oh, Michael's so clean.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nHe's so clean that they don't even really think.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:28.000\nYeah, it's probably like...\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:31.000\nSize is important.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:34.000\nThe closer you're hanging...\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:36.000\nDown there closer.\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:37.000\nThis is so exciting.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:38.000\nYou don't have to be taller.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:39.000\nI'm almost six foot four.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:44.000\nAnd when I'm at home, I generally sit because it's time too far away.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:45.000\nThis is another important issue.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nYou're sitting.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.000\nI'm tall about ten.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:53.000\nFirst of all, blessed is he that can sit down, as the Scandinavian poet once said.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:54.000\nSitting is great.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:55.000\nWe invented chairs for a reason.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nThey're important things.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nBut I'm going to splash.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nI'm too goddamn far away.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:05.000\nEven if I nail it, even if I'm completely hitting the clown's mouth of the carnival,\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:08.000\nmaking the balloon go up, I'm still just...\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:12.000\nMy reward for hitting the water in the middle of the bowl and not hitting the seat\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:16.000\nis refractory pee or toilet water coming out.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:17.000\nYou're very passionate about this.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:18.000\nI can see this.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nI want to do the right thing.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:21.000\nI want to do the right thing.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:22.000\nI'm a nighttime sitter.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:23.000\nReally?\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:24.000\nI sit at night.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:27.000\nIn the middle of the night, if I got to get up, I don't want to put the light on.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:28.000\nIt's going to be a disaster.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:32.000\nI only pee sitting when it turns out I have to pee.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:36.000\nWhen I have to take a poop, and then I'm like, oh, I had to take a pee.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:41.000\nSee, I'm a nighttime sit-down peer, but I'm a nighttime stand-up pooper.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nI stand a stand-up pooper.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:44.000\nThat is a...\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:45.000\nYou're a rare breed.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:46.000\nThat's a mic drop.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\nThat's a mic drop on the subjects.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:49.000\nAll right.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:52.000\nWell, okay.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:56.000\nSo how did your career start, Richie, now that you're our new Hollywood friend?\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:59.000\nBecause you're about to blow up because this movie's probably very funny.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:03.000\nWe talked about three o'clock high a lot.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:04.000\nI don't know.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:05.000\nSome amazing movie.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:09.000\nSome of the older fogies in the audience remember this movie, Three O'Clock High,\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:10.000\nthat was kind of like this cult hit.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:11.000\nIt didn't really like...\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:12.000\nIt didn't make a huge splash.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:13.000\nThere weren't nine sequels.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:14.000\nI don't even remember...\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:18.000\nI met the actor that played the bully, I told you, at a party at Sam Simon's house,\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:21.000\nand he looked identical, but I can't remember the actor's name.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:22.000\nRichard Tyson.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:23.000\nOkay.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:24.000\nAmazing.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nIs he here?\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:26.000\nWhat the hell?\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:27.000\nThat's it.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:28.000\nThat was...\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:30.000\nMy name is Richard Tyson.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:33.000\nFrank Johnson from Johnson Management.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:34.000\nAlso, I was in other movies.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nI have two clients.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nSparkles the Horse.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:37.000\nI was in other films, too.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:40.000\nAll right, we're talking over each other tonight.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nHow are we having...\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:48.000\nWell, Three O'Clock High also, in an era of John Hughes movies where there was a lot\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:53.800\nof hearts and a lot of big comedy, Three O'Clock High came out in that time, and it was dark\n\n18:53.800 --> 18:57.500\nand just edgy, and the cinematography was so interesting.\n\n18:57.500 --> 18:58.500\nIt had more...\n\n18:58.500 --> 19:02.520\nI remember seeing somebody talking about, you know, I don't know, directors forgive me\n\n19:02.520 --> 19:03.520\nfor a second.\n\n19:03.520 --> 19:04.520\nI think they're very silly people.\n\n19:04.520 --> 19:05.520\nThey are.\n\n19:05.520 --> 19:06.520\nThat's a fair point.\n\n19:06.520 --> 19:09.400\nThey're confusing to me because they think about things I don't think about.\n\n19:09.400 --> 19:15.440\nSo when you meet a good one or one that understands you, I grab them and hug them and go, please\n\n19:15.440 --> 19:23.520\nkeep working with me forever, Justin Lin, okay, go do nine Fast and Furious movies.\n\n19:23.520 --> 19:25.760\nBut why didn't I talk...\n\n19:25.760 --> 19:31.320\nSo I was watching, Hitchcock, Hitchcock, like he was...\n\n19:31.320 --> 19:32.680\nHe fucked with you more.\n\n19:32.680 --> 19:35.800\nIt was like you were in the hands of a madman a little bit.\n\n19:35.800 --> 19:39.400\nThere's all these different ways to talk about directing, like the philosophies, and Three\n\n19:39.400 --> 19:40.400\nO'Clock High.\n\n19:40.400 --> 19:43.000\nJohn Hughes, I think maybe he...\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:48.320\nIf you researched it, and maybe you have, but he probably did things with his cameras\n\n19:48.320 --> 19:55.320\nand his cutting that made you feel like you were on not only John Hughes' side, but that\n\n19:55.320 --> 20:00.640\nJohn Hughes was on the character's side, whereas Hitchcock, for instance, and then also whoever\n\n20:00.640 --> 20:05.560\ndirected Three O'Clock High, they were kind of intentionally going, you don't know who\n\n20:05.560 --> 20:06.560\nside I'm on.\n\n20:06.560 --> 20:07.560\nI agree.\n\n20:07.560 --> 20:08.560\nHitchcock really did fuck with you a lot.\n\n20:08.560 --> 20:12.400\nI mean, you see a movie like Psycho where you're supposed to be on one person's side\n\n20:12.400 --> 20:15.960\nin 20 minutes and she's killed, and you're like, oh, fuck, what just happened?\n\n20:15.960 --> 20:20.880\nAnd John Hughes, I agree, was very much very clear about whose side he was on.\n\n20:20.880 --> 20:24.080\nIt was the first time I was conscious as a kid in a movie theater watching Three O'Clock\n\n20:24.080 --> 20:29.400\nHigh of all these like weird like dolly shots, like just kind of almost needlessly, it was\n\n20:29.400 --> 20:31.320\nlike, oh, that's a weird thing to do with the camera.\n\n20:31.320 --> 20:34.960\nAnd apparently it was based on high noon, I assume, which I've never seen.\n\n20:34.960 --> 20:39.520\nBut because of the idea was, in the beginning of Three O'Clock High, the innocent kind of\n\n20:39.520 --> 20:45.320\nlike sweater clad, neb-ish character, not necessarily a nerd, but certainly not a jock.\n\n20:45.320 --> 20:49.880\nHe's just sort of a middleman in his high school biosphere, and he somehow accidentally\n\n20:49.880 --> 20:50.880\noffends this.\n\n20:50.880 --> 20:51.880\nHe touches him.\n\n20:51.880 --> 20:52.880\nThat's the big rule.\n\n20:52.880 --> 20:53.880\nYou can't touch him.\n\n20:53.880 --> 20:57.960\nAnd he says something like they run into each other at the urinal, and he says, I forget\n\n20:57.960 --> 21:03.440\nwhat he says, but he slaps him on the back and, you know, Buddy Ravel turns around.\n\n21:03.440 --> 21:04.440\nBuddy Ravel.\n\n21:04.440 --> 21:07.000\nAnd he's fucked for the rest of the day.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.160\nAnd it was kind of like, that was after Ferris Bueller, right?\n\n21:09.160 --> 21:15.400\nI assume that movie, because the guy was kind of, he looked, he had a broader look to him.\n\n21:15.400 --> 21:19.880\nAnd he was sort of a, I think the thought balloon above his head, like everyone in the\n\n21:19.880 --> 21:22.840\naudience was, I wish I was Ferris Bueller.\n\n21:22.840 --> 21:26.120\nBut why is it that when I try to be Ferris Bueller, I end up in the crosshairs of the\n\n21:26.120 --> 21:32.360\nmost terrifying man, this 35-year-old senior, who now is going to see me after school at\n\n21:32.360 --> 21:36.560\nthree o'clock, and the rest of the movie is just a psychological examination of your unraveling\n\n21:36.560 --> 21:38.640\nas you wait for three o'clock to show up.\n\n21:38.640 --> 21:40.560\nBut an amazing journey to a lot.\n\n21:40.560 --> 21:44.400\nLike, I remember as a kid just being, like, mesmerized by that movie.\n\n21:44.400 --> 21:48.400\nOur movie is nothing like that, aside from the concept of there's going to be a fight\n\n21:48.400 --> 21:49.400\nafter school.\n\n21:49.400 --> 21:50.400\nBut I love Three O'Clock Eye.\n\n21:50.400 --> 21:53.400\nI mean, I just think it's such a, it's such a movie worth revisiting, because-\n\n21:53.400 --> 21:55.400\nWell, I wouldn't have brought it up if I thought it was nothing like it.\n\n21:55.400 --> 21:56.400\nYeah.\n\n21:56.400 --> 21:57.400\nOkay.\n\n21:57.400 --> 21:58.400\nAll right.\n\n21:58.400 --> 22:02.320\nWell, no, I mean, the log line is very similar, which is there's going to be a fight after\n\n22:02.320 --> 22:03.320\nschool.\n\n22:03.320 --> 22:07.000\nThis just happens to be two teachers, and not two students, and what happens along the\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.160\nway is very different.\n\n22:09.160 --> 22:13.440\nBut it's a similar sort of, what the fuck would you do?\n\n22:13.440 --> 22:19.840\nThe difference, I think, in fist fight is even though Ice Cube goes a step too far early\n\n22:19.840 --> 22:26.080\nin the movie, as you go through the movie, if I did my job, and I hope I did, you might\n\n22:26.080 --> 22:32.300\nbe on his side as he continues talking about why he wants to do this, and as Charlie starts\n\n22:32.300 --> 22:36.360\nto be sketchier and sketchier in his methodology of getting out of it.\n\n22:36.360 --> 22:42.640\nSo, it's a little bit more by the time you get to this big fight, I think my hope is\n\n22:42.640 --> 22:46.840\nthat you're sort of kind of like, oh, I don't know who I want to see win, and how this is\n\n22:46.840 --> 22:47.840\ngoing to go down.\n\n22:47.840 --> 22:51.760\nWhereas, I think in Three O'Clock Eye, you want him to get those brass knuckles and knock\n\n22:51.760 --> 22:52.760\nBuddy Ravel out.\n\n22:52.760 --> 22:53.760\nRight.\n\n22:53.760 --> 22:54.760\nIt's quit, you know, if you can.\n\n22:54.760 --> 22:55.760\nYeah.\n\n22:55.760 --> 22:56.760\nDid you remember My Bodyguard?\n\n22:56.760 --> 22:57.760\nOf course.\n\n22:57.760 --> 22:58.760\nYeah, okay.\n\n22:58.760 --> 22:59.760\nI grew up in Chicago.\n\n22:59.760 --> 23:00.760\nAll those movies.\n\n23:00.760 --> 23:01.760\nI grew up in the suburbs of Chicago.\n\n23:01.760 --> 23:02.960\nI grew up in a huge country.\n\n23:02.960 --> 23:06.240\nThey were filming Ferris Bueller when I was a kid in my hometown.\n\n23:06.240 --> 23:07.240\nMy Bodyguard.\n\n23:07.240 --> 23:08.720\nThose were all the movies of my youth.\n\n23:08.720 --> 23:11.800\nI like about Three O'Clock Eye, because I love that movie, too.\n\n23:11.800 --> 23:14.440\nBut also, is it a play on Twelve O'Clock Eye?\n\n23:14.440 --> 23:18.960\nIt's not just Three O'Clock High School, like Three O'Clock High, but it's also like Twelve\n\n23:18.960 --> 23:19.960\nO'Clock High.\n\n23:19.960 --> 23:21.560\nIt's a war film, right?\n\n23:21.560 --> 23:22.560\nOh, wait.\n\n23:22.560 --> 23:24.560\nOh, there's a movie called Twelve O'Clock Eye.\n\n23:24.560 --> 23:28.440\nYeah, there's an old war film from the 40s or 50s.\n\n23:28.440 --> 23:30.560\nAnd Twelve O'Clock Eye, it's like, he's Twelve O'Clock High.\n\n23:30.560 --> 23:33.880\nIt's like fighter pilots talking about, like you're being attacked, like Three O'Clock\n\n23:33.880 --> 23:34.880\nHigh.\n\n23:34.880 --> 23:35.880\nI knew it was a high noon.\n\n23:35.880 --> 23:39.840\nI mean, I took Three O'Clock High, like look to your three, and he's up there.\n\n23:39.840 --> 23:41.640\nYou have someone coming at you at Three O'Clock High.\n\n23:41.640 --> 23:45.360\nWell, the focus is really on the time, so I just assumed that it was a high noon, because\n\n23:45.360 --> 23:49.280\nI'm sure high noon is like, oh, at noon you're gonna fucking gunfight.\n\n23:49.280 --> 23:51.280\nBut school gets out at three o'clock.\n\n23:51.280 --> 23:53.800\nThat's what I'm saying, and you can't say high three o'clock.\n\n23:53.800 --> 23:55.320\nYou guys are agreeing, and you don't know it.\n\n23:55.320 --> 23:56.320\nRight.\n\n23:56.320 --> 23:57.720\nI want to step in and help.\n\n23:57.720 --> 24:00.640\nI'm asking, I don't know if I'm conflating to things.\n\n24:00.640 --> 24:05.480\nI don't know if that was an intentional war movie called Twelve O'Clock.\n\n24:05.480 --> 24:06.480\nNo one knows.\n\n24:06.480 --> 24:07.480\nIt wasn't.\n\n24:07.480 --> 24:08.480\nThere wasn't.\n\n24:08.480 --> 24:09.480\nHe's fucking drunk again.\n\n24:09.480 --> 24:15.880\nYou're like this, I said modern veteran, because I didn't want to say veteran TV director,\n\n24:15.880 --> 24:21.640\nbecause then it sounds like you're 70, but you're, I mean, the TV director's life is\n\n24:21.640 --> 24:26.480\nlike very hand-to-mouth traveling, like Samurai.\n\n24:26.480 --> 24:28.440\nBilly Lohman style.\n\n24:28.440 --> 24:33.160\nYou're never, I mean, as a guy who ran one of these shows, you never directed a community,\n\n24:33.160 --> 24:34.160\nbut you do.\n\n24:34.160 --> 24:35.160\nI wish I had.\n\n24:35.160 --> 24:40.120\nBut like, the directors are like, we treat them like substitute math teachers, like even\n\n24:40.120 --> 24:45.120\nthe principal, if I could call myself that, treats them like substitute teachers, like\n\n24:45.120 --> 24:51.120\nit's like, oh, welcome, shithead, get it done, and then they go down into the hot box with\n\n24:51.120 --> 24:55.480\nthe actors who are on their 80th episode, and the actors are like, I got this, like\n\n24:55.480 --> 24:56.480\nwatch this.\n\n24:56.480 --> 24:57.480\nI call it the Allison.\n\n24:57.480 --> 25:01.720\nYeah, like, they direct themselves if they're worth their salt, and they'll like, they'll\n\n25:01.720 --> 25:06.520\nbust the director's balls, and they make friends with some of them, and they torture some of\n\n25:06.520 --> 25:08.520\nthem.\n\n25:08.520 --> 25:10.480\nBut every show is different.\n\n25:10.480 --> 25:14.960\nEvery show is really different, and that's what's, there's certain shows that you come\n\n25:14.960 --> 25:18.320\ninto, and it's like, they want your help.\n\n25:18.320 --> 25:21.320\nWhen I do, it's always something in Philadelphia, they're like, what do you want to do with\n\n25:21.320 --> 25:22.320\nthis?\n\n25:22.320 --> 25:23.320\nWhat's your take?\n\n25:23.320 --> 25:24.320\nWhat should we play with?\n\n25:24.320 --> 25:27.640\nWhat's your plan, you know, and we'll do what you want.\n\n25:27.640 --> 25:31.520\nShameless is like, making a movie, they're just like, go do whatever you want.\n\n25:31.520 --> 25:33.960\nJohn Wallace doesn't even have the writers on set.\n\n25:33.960 --> 25:36.960\nYou know, the Goldbergs, you're there to help.\n\n25:36.960 --> 25:37.960\nI'm there to help.\n\n25:37.960 --> 25:38.960\nI'm sure.\n\n25:38.960 --> 25:39.960\nAdam Goldberg.\n\n25:39.960 --> 25:41.080\nI'm there to help his vision.\n\n25:41.080 --> 25:44.120\nSo, and they're all fun and different.\n\n25:44.120 --> 25:49.320\nIt's really for me about point of view, someone who has a strong point of view that I could,\n\n25:49.320 --> 25:55.240\nthat I understand, and I can help and hopefully be additive, and there are certain gigs where\n\n25:55.240 --> 26:00.120\nyou're there just to help, and there are certain gigs where they need your help, and it's always\n\n26:00.120 --> 26:01.120\ndifferent.\n\n26:01.120 --> 26:05.560\nAnd I was a private acting coach and acting teacher for a long time, and so I love to\n\n26:05.560 --> 26:06.560\nmix it up.\n\n26:06.560 --> 26:09.640\nWhen I hear someone's difficult, I'm like, let me in there.\n\n26:09.640 --> 26:11.440\nWhen I hear an actor, oh, this actor's tough.\n\n26:11.440 --> 26:12.440\nThis actor's just really difficult.\n\n26:12.440 --> 26:13.960\nI'm like, I can't wait.\n\n26:13.960 --> 26:14.960\nLike that's fun for me.\n\n26:14.960 --> 26:16.600\nI know I'm going to reach that person.\n\n26:16.600 --> 26:18.080\nI know I'm going to find a way.\n\n26:18.080 --> 26:21.800\nI always do, and it's like, that's really joyful for me.\n\n26:21.800 --> 26:27.160\nYeah, well, with Chevy the way into his, into his, I've heard the stories.\n\n26:27.160 --> 26:29.280\nThere would be directors that he would be like, is she coming back?\n\n26:29.280 --> 26:30.280\nI love her.\n\n26:30.280 --> 26:33.880\nYou know, they'd be like, why does Chevy love that, that director, this director?\n\n26:33.880 --> 26:38.040\nAnd it was like, they, you know, they weren't bad directors, but they were just like, they\n\n26:38.040 --> 26:42.120\nsaw the writing on the wall and were like, nailed it Chevy, and like, like, let's shoot\n\n26:42.120 --> 26:43.120\nChevy out.\n\n26:43.120 --> 26:45.920\nYou know, like, and he was like, I love that person.\n\n26:45.920 --> 26:52.880\nAnyways, but I did want to ask you, like, so, so you're, you're kind of a man without\n\n26:52.880 --> 26:56.200\na country when you're, you're coming in because unless you direct a pilot, I don't know how\n\n26:56.200 --> 27:02.280\nmany people that are listening that are interested in working in TV versus features, no, like,\n\n27:02.280 --> 27:07.280\nunless you direct a pilot, you're not really, you know, you don't have ownership creatively\n\n27:07.280 --> 27:09.440\nor in actuality over that show.\n\n27:09.440 --> 27:13.400\nSo you are just coming in and you have like this really stringent period of time to shoot\n\n27:13.400 --> 27:16.000\nyour episode, to prep your episode, to shoot your episode.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:19.680\nAnd then you have like a little temporary office that's never going to be the best one.\n\n27:19.680 --> 27:23.040\nIt's like, there's no potted plant, director from last week has their shit still there.\n\n27:23.040 --> 27:27.080\nThere's like, there's like, scrawled switchblade carvings in the wall that are like, like,\n\n27:27.080 --> 27:31.800\nlike, don't eat the beans or the cake is a lie.\n\n27:31.800 --> 27:35.520\nThe, the, but you, and then, and then you have to, you know, it's like, you're always\n\n27:35.520 --> 27:36.520\nunder the gun.\n\n27:36.520 --> 27:40.560\nThere's like all this shit probably politically, like trickling down and you're not, the wine\n\n27:40.560 --> 27:45.120\nproducer might show up on the set and say, Oh, always, you got to eliminate three shots\n\n27:45.120 --> 27:46.120\nand all this stuff.\n\n27:46.120 --> 27:48.760\nSo then you have to have this like clinical relationship with it.\n\n27:48.760 --> 27:51.760\nAnd then you have to do your director's cut and you have like a week to do that, right?\n\n27:51.760 --> 27:55.240\nAnd then at the end of that week, no matter where you're at with that edit, you got to\n\n27:55.240 --> 27:57.040\ngo do another show.\n\n27:57.040 --> 27:59.160\nOtherwise you won't pay your rent, right?\n\n27:59.160 --> 28:06.080\nSo I guess my question is how within that weird clinical morass, how do you find the\n\n28:06.080 --> 28:07.080\npride?\n\n28:07.080 --> 28:08.080\nHow do you find the empathy?\n\n28:08.080 --> 28:09.680\nHow do you find the passion?\n\n28:09.680 --> 28:13.920\nIt's like any portfolio of work or anything.\n\n28:13.920 --> 28:15.520\nYou do a pilot and you have ownership.\n\n28:15.520 --> 28:17.360\nI have a pilot that I did a couple of years ago.\n\n28:17.360 --> 28:18.360\nIt's still going.\n\n28:18.360 --> 28:19.360\nIt's paying for my wedding.\n\n28:19.360 --> 28:20.360\nOkay.\n\n28:20.360 --> 28:23.680\nThen you go do an episode of a show that you really love the people on and you're there\n\n28:23.680 --> 28:28.240\nto help and you're cool with whatever the show runner does with your edit.\n\n28:28.240 --> 28:31.760\nThen you go make a movie and it's a year and a half of your life and it's all yours.\n\n28:31.760 --> 28:33.880\nAnd there's pros and cons truly to all of them.\n\n28:33.880 --> 28:41.680\nSo for me, I started so late that it's a miracle that I get to do any of it.\n\n28:41.680 --> 28:42.920\nI was a comic.\n\n28:42.920 --> 28:43.920\nI was an actor.\n\n28:43.920 --> 28:45.680\nI was an acting teacher.\n\n28:45.680 --> 28:50.760\nSo for me, that anyone wanted my help to begin with, I'm one of those annoyingly truly\n\n28:50.760 --> 28:54.200\ngrateful people who can't believe he gets to do it at all.\n\n28:54.200 --> 29:00.320\nAnd so it's a bonus when I come be a guest on a show and they're like, what do you think?\n\n29:00.320 --> 29:04.120\nAnd I find that that happens not more and more as I return to the same shows over and\n\n29:04.120 --> 29:05.120\nover again.\n\n29:05.120 --> 29:10.720\nBut how do you keep from falling into the sand traps of either A, getting so excited about\n\n29:10.720 --> 29:14.480\nthis episode of Sonny in Philadelphia, you're like, this is going to be fucking amazing.\n\n29:14.480 --> 29:19.000\nBut I needed more time and I didn't have more time like, how do you keep from throwing a\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:24.000\nshoe and going like, no, I need, let me do, let me take the weekend in the edit bay.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:25.560\nLike I'm almost done with my director's cut.\n\n29:25.560 --> 29:26.560\nThat happens.\n\n29:26.560 --> 29:33.080\nAnd I'm lucky that the shows I work on are shows I really dig and I really dig the showrunners.\n\n29:33.080 --> 29:39.120\nSo if there's a situation where I feel like, if I could just get a little more time, either\n\n29:39.120 --> 29:43.520\nI'll ask for it or I know they're going to, they're going to elevate it.\n\n29:43.520 --> 29:45.960\nSo why am I fighting?\n\n29:45.960 --> 29:51.480\nWhat's frustrating is when a line producer understandably is worried about something\n\n29:51.480 --> 29:56.100\nthat I know you need and you're in the writing room and you're not there.\n\n29:56.100 --> 29:59.800\nAnd that's a very tricky political situation and I know I have to get it.\n\n29:59.800 --> 30:03.280\nAnd then I just have to be difficult and say, sorry, bro, I'm shooting it.\n\n30:03.280 --> 30:10.440\nAnd, but I don't, everyone's while I throw a shoe, everyone's while my best self doesn't\n\n30:10.440 --> 30:13.680\ncome out because of the things we're talking about.\n\n30:13.680 --> 30:20.840\nBut for the most part in television, I'm there to help unless it's a show like the ones I\n\n30:20.840 --> 30:27.880\ndo a lot of, which is no coincidence, where they feel they want my additive value.\n\n30:27.880 --> 30:28.880\nDoes that make sense?\n\n30:28.880 --> 30:29.880\nYeah.\n\n30:29.880 --> 30:30.880\nJesus Christ, was that boring?\n\n30:30.880 --> 30:31.880\nYeah.\n\n30:31.880 --> 30:32.880\nLet's go back to pissing and D&D.\n\n30:32.880 --> 30:37.200\nWell, why don't we, why don't we spice things up by bringing some of your Chicago friends\n\n30:37.200 --> 30:40.680\nout here or fellow Chicago natives?\n\n30:40.680 --> 30:48.760\nI think we'll, as I understand it, we have, do we have, I mean, this shit gets dropped\n\n30:48.760 --> 30:51.840\non me like a fucking sandbag.\n\n30:51.840 --> 30:53.840\nNot in charge of when shit goes wrong.\n\n30:53.840 --> 30:56.840\nI'm only in charge of when shit goes right.\n\n30:56.840 --> 30:58.760\nThat's a nice, that's a good job.\n\n30:58.760 --> 31:01.840\nI think that was on Harry Truman's desk on that little sign.\n\n31:01.840 --> 31:02.840\nIt's certainly on Trump's.\n\n31:02.840 --> 31:06.840\nI mean, well, why don't we, let's, let's bring Dino Sabatopoulos out.\n\n31:06.840 --> 31:07.840\nYeah.\n\n31:07.840 --> 31:12.840\nNo, you don't have to move down.\n\n31:12.840 --> 31:22.840\nAll right, Dino's doing lines in the back.\n\n31:22.840 --> 31:36.400\nWow, you're going to be careful with those.\n\n31:36.400 --> 31:38.520\nI'm in big trouble, buddy.\n\n31:38.520 --> 31:39.520\nWhat happened?\n\n31:39.520 --> 31:45.000\nI did this graphic novel like 20 years ago and you had an artist work for three years\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:48.840\non it and hardcover and hi, Richie.\n\n31:48.840 --> 31:52.880\nYou guys, I was his intern in 1994, that's a true story.\n\n31:52.880 --> 31:58.640\nI didn't, I wasn't sure he was my intern, but then I made him say, hey, can you read\n\n31:58.640 --> 31:59.640\nmy script, please?\n\n31:59.640 --> 32:00.640\nYeah.\n\n32:00.640 --> 32:01.640\nAnd then I knew exactly who it was.\n\n32:01.640 --> 32:02.640\nIt was me.\n\n32:02.640 --> 32:03.640\nIt's a true story.\n\n32:03.640 --> 32:10.640\nUh, I made 2000, we printed 2000 of these and no one's going to buy them.\n\n32:10.640 --> 32:11.640\nI got a fucking copy.\n\n32:11.640 --> 32:12.640\nI'm sure that's not true, Dino.\n\n32:12.640 --> 32:13.640\nWoo.\n\n32:13.640 --> 32:14.640\nI feel like it's like an infomercial.\n\n32:14.640 --> 32:19.280\nNo, believe me, I fucking, I brought my guitar, I'm going to like, I'm going to do it like\n\n32:19.280 --> 32:21.360\na little monkey tap dance here.\n\n32:21.360 --> 32:23.640\nI brought Scott Attson and Brita Phillips.\n\n32:23.640 --> 32:24.640\nOh, yeah.\n\n32:24.640 --> 32:26.800\nI heard a gasp.\n\n32:26.800 --> 32:29.240\nThey're way more popular than me.\n\n32:29.240 --> 32:35.240\nYou mean Pete Hornberger from 30 Rock and the, the singer whose name I stole for the\n\n32:35.240 --> 32:36.240\ncharacter of a Brita.\n\n32:36.240 --> 32:37.240\nThat's right.\n\n32:37.240 --> 32:38.240\nYeah.\n\n32:38.240 --> 32:40.480\nI was going to bring IO Perry too.\n\n32:40.480 --> 32:44.760\nThe other half of the name, like who's, who's foibles I stole for the car.\n\n32:44.760 --> 32:45.760\nYeah.\n\n32:45.760 --> 32:46.760\nShe's in my band.\n\n32:46.760 --> 32:47.760\nSorry about everything.\n\n32:47.760 --> 32:48.760\nThat's the name.\n\n32:48.760 --> 32:49.760\nNo applause.\n\n32:49.760 --> 32:50.760\nNothing.\n\n32:50.760 --> 32:54.920\nBecause they don't know what you're talking about.\n\n32:54.920 --> 32:57.800\nI mean, you're late, you're late blooming, which is an exciting thing.\n\n32:57.800 --> 33:03.400\nI started a band at 52, fucking nightmare.\n\n33:03.400 --> 33:11.840\nWe're doing a gig actually on Saturday at, at star burns at, at super tight and my drummer,\n\n33:11.840 --> 33:14.800\nour drummer, it's not my band, it's our band.\n\n33:14.800 --> 33:18.080\nAnd the drummer couldn't make it because it's his birthday and he planned this thing,\n\n33:18.080 --> 33:21.280\nyou know, in Vegas for, he said, whatever you do, don't have a show on the 18th and\n\n33:21.280 --> 33:23.120\nnow we have a show on the 18th.\n\n33:23.120 --> 33:29.160\nAnd so I was on Facebook and one, a couple of my friends who were married and fucked\n\n33:29.160 --> 33:35.360\nand had a baby and the baby grew up to be 12 years old and now he's drumming on Facebook.\n\n33:35.360 --> 33:38.560\nSo I asked if he could drum and he's going to come and drum with us.\n\n33:38.560 --> 33:40.560\nNo, I want to come.\n\n33:40.560 --> 33:41.560\nThat's amazing.\n\n33:41.560 --> 33:42.560\nYou never know.\n\n33:42.560 --> 33:46.600\nSometimes you wake up to a carpet of ants, sometimes one of them turns into a drummer.\n\n33:46.600 --> 33:50.080\nThat's an amazing thing about our bodies.\n\n33:50.080 --> 33:57.640\nWe just shoot out torpedoes that either we're talking about a carpet of ants because I talked\n\n33:57.640 --> 33:58.640\nabout it on a scale.\n\n33:58.640 --> 34:02.760\nYeah, I just said that you guys, I just heard you and Dan brought that up, but I just today\n\n34:02.760 --> 34:06.400\nwas listening to you and Andy talking about how ants love to come.\n\n34:06.400 --> 34:09.440\nI did not know that they go nuts.\n\n34:09.440 --> 34:10.640\nThey like they'll visit.\n\n34:10.640 --> 34:15.080\nLet me do an imitation of an aunt just coming upon come like again, here's what you want\n\n34:15.080 --> 34:20.040\nto, here's what you want to spend $5 to subscribe to Harmontown so you can see.\n\n34:20.040 --> 34:22.480\nThe visuals of what Dino's about to do.\n\n34:22.480 --> 34:24.480\nThis is a normal aunt.\n\n34:24.480 --> 34:25.480\nLet's just say you're come.\n\n34:25.480 --> 34:26.480\nOkay.\n\n34:26.480 --> 34:28.480\nHe's going about his business.\n\n34:28.480 --> 34:29.480\nOh, shit!\n\n34:29.480 --> 34:30.480\nOh, where are the guys?\n\n34:30.480 --> 34:31.480\nWhere's everyone?\n\n34:31.480 --> 34:32.480\nWhich way do I go?\n\n34:32.480 --> 34:33.480\nWhich way do I go?\n\n34:33.480 --> 34:40.720\nThey literally go nuts when they taste the come.\n\n34:40.720 --> 34:41.720\nIt's awful.\n\n34:41.720 --> 34:50.000\nDo you think it's maybe, here's a theory, maybe it's because ants, ants are so sophisticated\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:58.280\nas carnivores that they can taste DNA and they, and they, and they're tasting the sophistication\n\n34:58.280 --> 35:03.600\nof a primate, which is like they don't even, their brain can't process it.\n\n35:03.600 --> 35:08.560\nTheir aunt tongues are like, this is beyond grilled octopus.\n\n35:08.560 --> 35:09.560\nI don't think so.\n\n35:09.560 --> 35:13.240\nI think it's, I think it's I drink pineapple juice and it tastes great.\n\n35:13.240 --> 35:15.360\nOh, he loves pineapple juice.\n\n35:15.360 --> 35:17.360\nThat's the camera.\n\n35:17.360 --> 35:18.360\nAnts love pineapples.\n\n35:18.360 --> 35:19.360\nThey do.\n\n35:19.360 --> 35:20.360\nAll right.\n\n35:20.360 --> 35:25.040\nWell, we only have one extra chair, Dino, so you, you, I understand you brought 17 people\n\n35:25.040 --> 35:26.040\nfrom your show.\n\n35:26.040 --> 35:27.200\nThey don't, they can't even sit here.\n\n35:27.200 --> 35:30.440\nI got my, my drawing room back.\n\n35:30.440 --> 35:33.120\nI want to, I want to help you.\n\n35:33.120 --> 35:34.760\nYou guys are both from Chicago.\n\n35:34.760 --> 35:36.240\nWe should talk a little for a second.\n\n35:36.240 --> 35:38.600\nI'm from Milwaukee, which is much colder.\n\n35:38.600 --> 35:39.600\nAnd shittier.\n\n35:39.600 --> 35:40.600\nYeah.\n\n35:40.600 --> 35:41.600\nIn general.\n\n35:41.600 --> 35:42.600\nFireworks.\n\n35:42.600 --> 35:48.640\nBut, you know, why so many, I think a lot of everyone in Los Angeles that works in television\n\n35:48.640 --> 35:50.200\nis, is, is from Chicago.\n\n35:50.200 --> 35:53.360\nI wonder is what, what, what, what that is.\n\n35:53.360 --> 35:54.360\nSecond city.\n\n35:54.360 --> 35:55.360\nWell, funny.\n\n35:55.360 --> 35:56.360\nYou should ask.\n\n35:56.360 --> 35:57.360\nUh, I have no idea.\n\n35:57.360 --> 36:03.240\nNo, I, uh, I was thinking about that too because I, I grew up and I wanted to do nothing\n\n36:03.240 --> 36:05.160\nelse but comedy.\n\n36:05.160 --> 36:08.400\nAnd I think it was just coincidence that Chicago was a comedy based city.\n\n36:08.400 --> 36:13.760\nI think, you know, I'm just a goofy, ugly guy who got picked on a lot.\n\n36:13.760 --> 36:15.440\nSo of course I wanted to get a new comedy.\n\n36:15.440 --> 36:16.440\nYou're beautiful.\n\n36:16.440 --> 36:17.440\nOh my God.\n\n36:17.440 --> 36:18.440\nCome on.\n\n36:18.440 --> 36:19.440\nYeah.\n\n36:19.440 --> 36:20.440\nWell, that's where I know you from.\n\n36:20.440 --> 36:21.440\nYou're, you're down here.\n\n36:21.440 --> 36:26.440\nThanks for letting me audition for that sketch.\n\n36:26.440 --> 36:29.080\nI never fucking read it.\n\n36:29.080 --> 36:33.480\nYou sucked me off and I didn't even read your sketch.\n\n36:33.480 --> 36:35.640\nWhen did you, you guys were, you're talking about Conan.\n\n36:35.640 --> 36:36.640\nYeah.\n\n36:36.640 --> 36:37.640\nHe was your intern.\n\n36:37.640 --> 36:38.640\nI was an intern.\n\n36:38.640 --> 36:39.640\nYeah.\n\n36:39.640 --> 36:44.080\nThe first summer on the air, I was the general office intern.\n\n36:44.080 --> 36:50.680\nSo this guy, Smigal, Louie, Louie with the trumpet and the gum thrown against the wall.\n\n36:50.680 --> 36:51.680\nAnd I couldn't believe it.\n\n36:51.680 --> 36:52.680\nI couldn't believe it.\n\n36:52.680 --> 36:53.680\nHe had a trumpet.\n\n36:53.680 --> 36:54.680\nI don't remember that.\n\n36:54.680 --> 36:56.680\nHe was walking around the trumpet and he never played it.\n\n36:56.680 --> 36:59.240\nHe, I don't think, I know he didn't play the trumpet.\n\n36:59.240 --> 37:00.240\nHe had one.\n\n37:00.240 --> 37:01.240\nSo he was like, hadn't he?\n\n37:01.240 --> 37:05.200\nOne day he, he spit his gum and he threw a trumpet and it just stuck to the wall.\n\n37:05.200 --> 37:06.200\nSomething like that.\n\n37:06.200 --> 37:08.000\nWere you there when we had the kitten running around too?\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:09.000\nI don't remember the kitten.\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:12.720\nThere was a kitten called, we were going to call this show night night with Conan O'Brien,\n\n37:12.720 --> 37:15.920\nbut they wouldn't let us at NBC.\n\n37:15.920 --> 37:19.400\nSo we named a kitten night night and it just wandered around everywhere.\n\n37:19.400 --> 37:20.920\nAnd everyone loved this kitten.\n\n37:20.920 --> 37:24.680\nAnd then Max Weinberg came and he was like, I'm allergic to kittens and we had to get\n\n37:24.680 --> 37:25.680\nrid of it.\n\n37:25.680 --> 37:26.680\nWhat a dick.\n\n37:26.680 --> 37:27.680\nHe's a dick.\n\n37:27.680 --> 37:28.680\nRight?\n\n37:28.680 --> 37:29.680\nHe was a dick.\n\n37:29.680 --> 37:30.680\nHe literally was a dick.\n\n37:30.680 --> 37:31.680\nI didn't like him.\n\n37:31.680 --> 37:34.080\nI had, he threatened to beat me up a few times.\n\n37:34.080 --> 37:38.000\nIt's that Bruce, it's that East Street band, Moxie, you know?\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:41.240\nYeah, except Bruce had talent.\n\n37:41.240 --> 37:45.560\nI heard, I heard that he couldn't even keep a beat.\n\n37:45.560 --> 37:46.560\nLike keep time.\n\n37:46.560 --> 37:48.120\nLet's get a Twitter war going tonight.\n\n37:48.120 --> 37:51.800\nI think, I will say with Chicago, I mean, I can only speak about my experience, but\n\n37:51.800 --> 37:57.200\nlike between getting exposed to all the movies filming there, my bodyguard, the John Hughes\n\n37:57.200 --> 38:02.600\nstuff, and having Second City that you go to, it occurred to me that comedy was something\n\n38:02.600 --> 38:04.920\nyou could do as a job.\n\n38:04.920 --> 38:07.480\nAnd it wasn't just something that happened far away.\n\n38:07.480 --> 38:10.200\nI think that for me was part of it.\n\n38:10.200 --> 38:11.720\nYeah, because you're a good looking guy.\n\n38:11.720 --> 38:12.720\nI'll take it.\n\n38:12.720 --> 38:13.720\nI'll take it.\n\n38:13.720 --> 38:14.720\nBut we don't have anything to compare.\n\n38:14.720 --> 38:15.720\nYou scratched my back.\n\n38:15.720 --> 38:16.720\nI'll scratch yours, my friend.\n\n38:16.720 --> 38:20.200\nBecause I mean, I grew up in Milwaukee, which is like a smaller, I'm going to offend my\n\n38:20.200 --> 38:22.080\nMilwaukee brethren.\n\n38:22.080 --> 38:23.760\nIt's a smaller Chicago.\n\n38:23.760 --> 38:29.640\nIt also had its own little smaller comedy community, you know, like, so I have to wonder\n\n38:29.640 --> 38:34.400\nlike, okay, maybe if you grew up in a town of 200 people, I guess maybe you didn't grow\n\n38:34.400 --> 38:38.400\nup around comedy clubs and, I don't know.\n\n38:38.400 --> 38:43.560\nLike, I mean, I, I don't know what my point is, like, what am I trying to scientifically\n\n38:43.560 --> 38:47.680\nprove there's something in the water in Chicago that makes them move to L.A.?\n\n38:47.680 --> 38:48.680\nI'm not sure.\n\n38:48.680 --> 38:54.240\nI do think Second City, a lot of people came out of Second City as like a breeding ground\n\n38:54.240 --> 38:59.280\nand I don't know why it might be like maybe people in Chicago are like, well, I got to\n\n38:59.280 --> 39:05.080\nmove to one of two bigger cities and I don't want to move to the fucking dirty one.\n\n39:05.080 --> 39:06.080\nAnd I'm sick of the cold.\n\n39:06.080 --> 39:07.080\nRight.\n\n39:07.080 --> 39:08.080\nI'm sick of the cold.\n\n39:08.080 --> 39:10.560\nI look like a fucking more complicated one.\n\n39:10.560 --> 39:11.560\nRight.\n\n39:11.560 --> 39:12.560\nYeah.\n\n39:12.560 --> 39:13.560\nThat's probably what it is.\n\n39:13.560 --> 39:14.560\nIt's like, yeah, forget it, brother.\n\n39:14.560 --> 39:15.560\nOkay.\n\n39:15.560 -->

Yeah\n\n40:44.880 --> 40:51.300\nYeah, no, I we saw this this is a funny story. We saw the second plane hit out our window\n\n40:51.300 --> 40:53.300\nUh\n\n40:54.140 --> 41:01.380\nLuckily, it wasn't a plane window. We were we were actually in our house and I was like check, please New York\n\n41:02.220 --> 41:04.220\nAnd I was like all three stooches\n\n41:06.820 --> 41:13.640\nI just love that concept because I it tickles me so much because the the flowchart your brain goes through is like\n\n41:13.640 --> 41:20.660\nOh, you're not you're not supposed to have that reaction because that's cowardly like your job is to stand there and get out of\n\n41:20.660 --> 41:22.260\nsword\n\n41:22.260 --> 41:24.020\nBring another one\n\n41:24.020 --> 41:28.860\nwell, you know people did help drag out bodies and stuff, but you know\n\n41:29.460 --> 41:32.420\nSorry everyone, but I had a daughter, you know\n\n41:32.420 --> 41:38.660\nShe was like two years old and we're really close and we're living there and and like the fumes of\n\n41:40.260 --> 41:42.060\nEverything was coming in people are getting sick\n\n41:42.060 --> 41:48.020\nSo by the way, I talked to a kid in New York who works for a law firm who you know under the Obama administration\n\n41:48.020 --> 41:53.820\nThere was attention paid to this because it otherwise, you know, wouldn't have been not to not to\n\n41:54.260 --> 41:58.380\nSuck a previous administration stick too hard, but doesn't take that much these days\n\n42:00.260 --> 42:07.140\nProbably people people in Arkansas that are Obama lovers right now, but the the the the\n\n42:07.780 --> 42:13.300\nThere was a you know, he his administration said, you know, come on. There's there's been\n\n42:13.300 --> 42:20.180\nYou got fucked up if you were lived near ground zero like it's bestest and all this shit. Anyways, I don't know\n\n42:20.180 --> 42:25.940\nYeah, I got out of there and also I had you know, I have this amazing little, you know carrot dangling called\n\n42:26.340 --> 42:28.340\nwriting for master of disguise\n\n42:30.260 --> 42:34.260\nNow master of disguise was I knew you were gonna grab onto this\n\n42:34.260 --> 42:41.180\nUh Dana Carvey movie about a guy who these kids grew up on that movie. So, you know that movie?\n\n42:42.980 --> 42:51.020\nThere's probably you know, you know was brought in to save it. Yeah, I rewrote I rewrote 90% of it and\n\n42:51.980 --> 42:53.980\nthen\n\n42:54.340 --> 43:00.540\nAdam Sandler came in and took my 90% out and threw it away and put in fart jokes and bush jokes and everything I\n\n43:01.540 --> 43:03.260\nI I\n\n43:03.260 --> 43:09.020\nWish I could show you my cut because I I don't have it and so you're never gonna believe me that I\n\n43:10.660 --> 43:12.660\nIt was better\n\n43:13.140 --> 43:16.180\nThe idea that there's a fucking masterpiece\n\n43:17.180 --> 43:19.180\nversion of master of disguise\n\n43:19.540 --> 43:21.540\nIt's not outside the relevant\n\n43:21.940 --> 43:27.900\nWasn't a masterpiece, but god damn it. It was kind of fun. They shot your version. Yeah, they shot it\n\n43:27.900 --> 43:34.860\nRe-editing re-editing disaster. Yeah, yeah, he had a friends and family screening and they said we're not gonna take any notes from them\n\n43:34.860 --> 43:36.860\nWe're just you know, it's just the friends and family\n\n43:38.340 --> 43:43.180\nEvery note they took every note brutal. Yeah more farts was the main joke more farts\n\n43:43.460 --> 43:48.420\nOne one joke and I'm probably gonna bury myself because you're probably gonna go that sounds bad\n\n43:48.700 --> 43:55.420\nbut if you remember halfway like he has a little puppy called the cuteness which wasn't out my\n\n43:55.420 --> 43:58.340\nidea, let's a little puppy because the\n\n43:59.540 --> 44:00.820\nI\n\n44:00.820 --> 44:07.620\nForget who like with Sony said we need a little puppy in this you yeah, so it showed up and\n\n44:08.060 --> 44:14.940\nHalfway through the movie it just got lost and then the grandfather came in that and he was the master of disguise, right?\n\n44:14.940 --> 44:21.700\nSounds bad. Yeah. Yeah, so I didn't write any of that and then halfway through the the grandfather comes in\n\n44:21.700 --> 44:25.260\nHe's supposed to be a master of disguise and the puppies never talked about again\n\n44:25.260 --> 44:30.820\nSo my idea was that the grandfather was there the whole time. He was in the little puppy costume\n\n44:31.580 --> 44:37.900\nAnd then he came out and then at the end they're like we missed the cuteness. He's like, oh, I hate dog food\n\n44:37.900 --> 44:40.780\nAll right, and he has to go back and be a puppy for the rest of his life\n\n44:41.020 --> 44:43.620\nYou know puppy awesome and the big note was\n\n44:44.180 --> 44:48.700\nLike parents were going don't kill the puppy at the end. It's like you're not we're not killing a puppy\n\n44:48.700 --> 44:53.260\nWe're bringing it back to life. I mean, yeah, didn't make any sense whatsoever fucking hate Adam Sandler\n\n44:54.100 --> 44:58.100\nBen Stiller Adam Sandler Max Weinberg. They can all fuck themselves\n\n45:01.100 --> 45:06.980\nThe big moment it's a big moment someone's gonna catch I hate those guys. I hate those guys\n\n45:06.980 --> 45:12.180\nThey ruin my life.

No, it's because he had no I they had no idea\n\n49:18.780 --> 49:23.940\nI was going out there to say we can't do that's because he gets money to write the charts for it\n\n49:23.940 --> 49:29.860\nYeah, and they they got a lot of shit for it.

So\n\n50:07.580 --> 50:13.140\nso I had this bit called to marry the ostrich where I got into an ostrich costume and\n\n50:14.260 --> 50:16.060\nThank you\n\n50:16.060 --> 50:18.060\nyou're my biggest fan and\n\n50:19.100 --> 50:21.420\nso I would come out every once in a while and\n\n50:21.940 --> 50:29.220\njust the whole bit was just like going out in this ostrich costume and hitting people with the head in the neck and and stuff and\n\n50:30.820 --> 50:34.060\nOne time when the band was complaining. I said don't worry. I'll get max and\n\n50:34.580 --> 50:37.380\nI get it went out and they're you know, they're playing this song\n\n50:37.380 --> 50:43.740\nthen and then and then and then the just dumb ostrich comes out and I take the head and I start bashing his drum set and\n\n50:43.740 --> 50:46.780\nknock and I knocked over a cymbals that broke them and\n\n50:47.300 --> 50:50.780\nshit and and then I did my bit and left and\n\n50:51.820 --> 50:57.180\nEnter it might have been you someone came up to me and said get the fuck out of here max is going to break your neck\n\n50:57.940 --> 50:59.940\nAnd I fucking ran home\n\n51:00.300 --> 51:06.940\nAnd he and he asked for my check that week for your check for the tomorrow the ostrich check, which is\n\n51:09.060 --> 51:11.540\nHe's like he's not getting paid for that ostrich stint\n\n51:11.540 --> 51:18.100\nAnd he got my three hundred dollars.

I'm not a musician expert person, but but I think if you can break\n\n51:42.380 --> 51:45.780\nSymbols you should get that money back from the Guitar Center\n\n51:46.660 --> 51:48.900\nLike if there's symbols their job is to\n\n51:49.660 --> 51:56.260\nCrash yeah, that's what he said.

Oh\n\n51:59.380 --> 52:02.060\nI guarantee it if he thinks symbols can break\n\n52:02.060 --> 52:09.620\nThen he thinks democracy can be fucked with turns out it can't I thought so too. I'm embarrassed now I\n\n52:10.340 --> 52:12.340\nFound out my mom my mom my mom\n\n52:12.340 --> 52:14.300\nI don't know if my mom wants me to talk about it\n\n52:14.300 --> 52:19.420\nBut I want to talk about how good it feels when you find out that somebody you were afraid to ask\n\n52:20.020 --> 52:23.740\nWho they voted for you know like turns out to you know my mom\n\n52:23.740 --> 52:30.140\nI don't know.

She never raised me badly\n\n52:34.100 --> 52:40.980\nBut when I got home from lax like when I accidentally protested by landing on top of the protest for an airplane or thing\n\n52:41.380 --> 52:42.380\nI\n\n52:42.380 --> 52:47.660\nAnd I kind of tweeted the play-by-play of it and I got home and she texted me and and\n\n52:48.700 --> 52:52.140\nShe sent me a picture of her in a pink pussy hat and it was\n\n52:53.140 --> 52:58.620\nI was afraid to ask I thought I really thought I was very comfortable thinking I just assumed my Wisconsin parents\n\n52:58.620 --> 53:05.380\nYou know that they voted for for Trump, and I really didn't want to know that yeah next Thanksgiving will be way less awkward for you\n\n53:05.580 --> 53:10.740\nYeah, I mean I guess I don't really go there for Thanksgiving\n\n53:11.540 --> 53:15.260\nGuess I'm kind of maybe now.

They're very placid\n\n54:33.780 --> 54:35.780\nAnd they don't know how to use the gun either\n\n54:35.780 --> 54:42.540\nSo Dan when you bought the gun when you said I'm gonna get a gun. What was the motivation? What did you picture using it for Trump?\n\n54:44.180 --> 54:46.180\nNo, no, no, no, I\n\n54:47.060 --> 54:52.660\nHad to kill Trump that he was elected president and now you we should be you just don't want to be a sitting duck\n\n54:52.660 --> 54:54.100\nIt's start. It's yes\n\n54:54.100 --> 54:57.260\nIt's start it started with me being scared of general destabilization\n\n54:57.620 --> 55:01.660\nAnd then the first and then I saw I had Spencer start researching like well\n\n55:01.660 --> 55:06.300\nWhat do you do when you want to get one and Spencer did some research and it's like well one of the things\n\n55:06.300 --> 55:09.420\nI learned is 10-day waiting period. Okay for a handgun in LA\n\n55:09.900 --> 55:10.900\nand\n\n55:10.900 --> 55:17.100\nAnd then during the first 10 days of this administration so much shit happened that I was like, okay\n\n55:17.100 --> 55:23.100\nI'm not you know a 10-day waiting period is exactly the amount of time you want to I was just like\n\n55:23.100 --> 55:25.540\nI don't know why I will want this\n\n55:25.540 --> 55:34.020\nI have to assume I may need it that I will want it twice as much 10 days right right right the first 10 days was a doozy\n\n55:35.540 --> 55:40.740\nIt looked very familiar to anyone who didn't fall asleep during 10th grade history class\n\n55:41.220 --> 55:48.900\nLike it looked real fucking familiar and and and I just I kind of sometimes I talked about with my therapist\n\n55:48.900 --> 55:50.900\nShe asked me the same thing. What's it for?\n\n55:50.900 --> 55:55.420\nIs it for you as it for you know, it's like like\n\n55:56.100 --> 55:58.420\nLook, it's it's for\n\n55:59.420 --> 56:09.140\nSometimes it's for the fact that like I think it's just a general state of like it's for the fact that all of my control over my\n\n56:10.100 --> 56:18.860\nMy recourse to representation my recourse to sanity and stuff like that being taken away. It's like I'm this white privileged\n\n56:18.860 --> 56:22.780\nDude, that's just like it's my first experience with it\n\n56:22.780 --> 56:25.180\nThose those nerve endings have never been stimulated\n\n56:25.180 --> 56:31.020\nSo I just fucking wandered out and bought a power tool. That's like the same\n\n56:31.020 --> 56:35.780\nYou know, it's like like no sometimes you might want to put a hole in another person at some point\n\n56:35.860 --> 56:40.540\nLike like it's like a black and decker commercial in your head. It's just like don't be caught off guard with\n\n56:41.580 --> 56:45.320\nIt's just sort of like like sometimes in my head if the dust is attacking you\n\n56:45.320 --> 56:48.240\nSo sometimes sometimes in my head\n\n56:48.240 --> 56:55.480\nIt's just a general destabilization thing where it's like like like I want to have it in a locked case somewhere in my home\n\n56:56.520 --> 56:58.520\nso that if\n\n56:58.600 --> 57:04.960\nBecause of all this domino effect of all the shit that's being caused by people who are rank amateurs in the White House who are\n\n57:04.960 --> 57:09.320\njust think executive orders are just like fucking office memos and and\n\n57:09.320 --> 57:16.160\nand and purposely causing destabilization and also out and out calling out to cities and\n\n57:16.520 --> 57:23.040\nStates and saying I don't I don't recognize your sovereignty like like like all this talk going on\n\n57:23.240 --> 57:30.040\nSometimes the thought in my head is like this is a this is as close as we're ever gonna get in our lifetime to a situation that could cause\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:33.000\nplummets of\n\n57:33.360 --> 57:37.000\ninfrastructure on a on a level that would make me\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:44.760\nresponsible for the food and water of like a large group of people in my neighborhood and I and and so\n\n57:44.960 --> 57:48.520\nMaybe that guy should have a gun because for friendly reasons\n\n57:49.160 --> 57:56.640\nBecause they won't listen to a whistle around my neck. I don't know like like I don't what maybe I'll maybe I end up in charge of\n\n57:56.960 --> 57:58.960\n19 kids, you know\n\n57:58.960 --> 58:04.620\nI don't I don't I don't I don't I don't want to wait until the moment. I'm like I\n\n58:04.620 --> 58:09.500\nI think I think it's the apocalypse and Dan Harmon never wanted to be a father\n\n58:11.740 --> 58:13.740\nThat's it come ever\n\n58:14.180 --> 58:20.620\nAnd the funny thing about the end of the world is they did yeah, you just never there's never enough time\n\n58:21.260 --> 58:26.660\nTo prepare for it and you just kind of go. Yeah, what's this? What are some of the tools? I'll need\n\n58:26.660 --> 58:29.380\nI mean, I'm also getting a water filter. I'm not\n\n58:29.380 --> 58:35.940\nExclusive I'm not exclusively going. How will I kill people? I'm like how like I'm obsessed about all these details\n\n58:35.940 --> 58:38.460\nAnd one of them is like like I think or so\n\n58:38.820 --> 58:42.020\nYeah, did you did you talk about going in and buying this yet?\n\n58:42.020 --> 58:48.660\nCuz one of my favorite things that you said when you walked in is like it's they're so excited to see it's like a sushi restaurant\n\n58:48.660 --> 58:50.660\nIt is\n\n58:51.140 --> 58:54.860\nWhen you actually start looking around for them in Burbank, it's like holy shit\n\n58:54.860 --> 58:59.740\nThey're like I just I don't think this is it's very much of an exaggeration come out of hiding these places\n\n58:59.740 --> 59:02.780\nYou did the street that we went on it had like nine\n\n59:03.380 --> 59:09.260\nIt was like there were three on a block. Yeah, and they weren't that there's like are they competing with each other\n\n59:09.260 --> 59:15.660\nThey had sandwich boards out front like a boutique restaurant like like nine millimeter ammo half off and stuff. Yeah\n\n59:16.380 --> 59:18.380\nHey, I'm helping out\n\n59:18.380 --> 59:23.740\nSorry, I like it when you talk. Thanks. Me too. No, they're very\n\n59:25.380 --> 59:33.860\nThey're very excited about new gun owners at gun stores for obvious reasons old gun owners probably probably die\n\n59:36.420 --> 59:44.380\nThey're like hey, it's like buying a motorcycle. Yeah, exactly. We're not we're not what's not catered to our base\n\n59:44.380 --> 59:49.580\nWe need to swell our ranks. I don't know anything about guns\n\n59:51.260 --> 59:53.260\nWelcome to people boys in\n\n59:54.940 --> 01:00:01.580\nAll right, yeah, but anyways my 10-day waiting period is up. So now I'll have a little I'll have a locked case in my home\n\n01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:06.180\nPut a gun to their heads Lee and tell them to buy some Trent books\n\n01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:11.740\nBuy some buy it by I like segues. Yeah, we got Britta back there\n\n01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:17.460\nWe could sing a song you want to do a selection from your from your comp from your graphic novel\n\n01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:23.220\nWhich is also a musical about it's the it's a world's first musical graphic novel\n\n01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.220\nI haven't done a lot of research on that\n\n01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:30.260\nBut I'm pretty sure I mean I googled musical graphic novel and mine was the only one that came up\n\n01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.980\nSo maybe if I had\n\n01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:38.540\nBut there was musical and then graphic novel and then just me if ice if I step over here behind Spencer\n\n01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:45.500\nYou'll have this space to play your guitar. Oh, yeah, and then and then Britta could come out and sing a selection or without Scott\n\n01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:50.620\nSo, all right, let's rotate and bring up Britta. You can talk to her\n\n01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:05.380\nBefore she starts talking she was the voice the singing voice of gem in gem in the Argonauts hologram hologram\n\n01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:09.660\nOh, thank you. And and what else were you you were in your Luna?\n\n01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.060\nTalk about yourself\n\n01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:21.620\nI don't like to talk about myself, but I I like to show up wherever Dino says to come and she was the voice of\n\n01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:25.740\nBlobberta on moral oral. Yes, and she was also\n\n01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:28.980\nElizabeth in Frankenhol Frankenhol\n\n01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.380\nDan took the mic oh\n\n01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.460\nNo, you should keep it. I know I can use Spencer's here\n\n01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.660\nOkay. Yeah, Spencer never talks. I\n\n01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:44.300\nLike it when you talk he picks his shots\n\n01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.100\nSo\n\n01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:50.660\nYeah, what were you saying? I just want you to point at me when it's my turn to sing\n\n01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.220\nSo anyway\n\n01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:00.420\nYeah, if you guys know moral oral at all\n\n01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:05.980\nWell, if you like third season of moral oral, which is what got me canceled and in trouble\n\n01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.420\nYou'll like Trent because it's really depressing\n\n01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:15.060\nBut it's uplifting a little bit too, right? I don't want to give away too much about it\n\n01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:19.580\nIt's about hope and people are traditionally in the market for\n\n01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:27.220\nSynicism and depression but even now in in today's political. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know\n\n01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:33.460\nIt's the word. I know it's the worst time to bring a dark black novel out\n\n01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.540\nYou know, it's such a dark black time\n\n01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:42.420\nIt should sell really don't buy it don't buy it\n\n01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.420\nIt's not cheap either\n\n01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:50.100\nAren't you I looked at the price\n\n01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:57.500\nLike really why should really selling it like if someone gives you $25 on this stage, won't you give them a book from that box?\n\n01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.500\nYou have it's not $25. It's\n\n01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:04.860\n2499 and a penny. So you're saying it's something it's something nobody wants and it's\n\n01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:07.860\n$15 and $16\n\n01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:09.540\nWait, what?\n\n01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.540\nNo, the ship is sailed\n\n01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:18.980\nNo, I will sell it for $20 here and and these guys will we you sign it to\n\n01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:24.180\nRichie, I can't wait to sign.

I\n\n01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:33.140\nI actually made it because I want to make a stop motion movie of it and really bore everyone silly\n\n01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:38.780\nSo maybe you could direct it.

How many acts are in this three acts, you know\n\n01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:33.380\nI was asked about the sound department. Do you have volume control on your guitar? And if so, can you turn it up a bit?\n\n01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:36.300\nIt's all up. Let's do that\n\n01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:38.700\nHow's that?\n\n01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:44.700\nIs there something wrong with it? It's a new guitar. They just they just wanted it louder for the for the audio, right? I know I\n\n01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:52.140\nSay turn up a little bit more. Well, no, it can't go up. Okay, but it's a pretty song\n\n01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:56.300\nShould we all come back later? I\n\n01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:05.140\nThought you made fun of him not me.

I don't want to spoiler alert it for everyone who's not gonna buy it\n\n01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:46.740\nBut I don't know if the song will resonate like you want it to if they don't know what's going on\n\n01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:49.500\nYeah, let's really get to the bottom of this\n\n01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:53.660\nLet's really stick their thing this through.

It's about pregnancy something happens to their baby. It\n\n01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:11.100\nlives\n\n01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:16.580\nOn what page every two things babies do\n\n01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:21.020\nOne of them is they they grow up to be people\n\n01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:28.940\nThere's a lot of things that could go wrong with a baby. Oh, that reminds me of a story\n\n01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:31.180\nYou know that story about my friend\n\n01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:37.620\nI was watching a movie outlawed Jesse Wales with my friend and my brother was there and he had seen it and at one point\n\n01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:39.380\nMy friend asked my brother\n\n01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:44.060\nDoes this character die and I'm like don't whisper it to him. I don't want to know\n\n01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:50.140\nSo my brother whispers if he died or not and then we start watching some more and my friend turns to him and says when?\n\n01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:54.900\nWhen does he keep living?\n\n01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:00.100\nThat's story so funny. I've already told it when you weren't here\n\n01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:06.860\nI've actually already told it's not got a big one. No. Yeah, they don't care\n\n01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:11.700\nOkay, so\n\n01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:17.620\nIt's a pretty song. I'm probably gonna screw it up. What what do you want?

What part of your body did they bite you?\n\n01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000\nAnd describe it slowly\n\n01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000\nThe hands\n\n01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:13.680\nThey bit me on the hands I know because you had duck food and yeah, so you yeah\n\n01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:20.280\nOne time me and my friends were hanging out behind a Costco and we found that they threw out\n\n01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:25.680\nMore than 40 fresh loaves of bread because they got the new bread in but they weren't bad breads\n\n01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:30.680\nPresumably so we got 40 loaves of bread and went to the duck pond\n\n01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:36.280\nIt was good, I think you guys were probably stoned we\n\n01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:44.240\nNo, we were definitely stoned, but that's not this time. We were making it rain. We were like slices and slices\n\n01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:50.600\nJust flood in the water. It's probably bad for the local environment\n\n01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:56.920\nBut uh, no, you know, they're they were all loving I used to feed ducks and animals a lot like a duck pond in\n\n01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:58.480\nSimi Valley, there wasn't a lot to do\n\n01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:03.080\nThere was a big duck pond that you could go to all sorts of animals and so sometimes you'd feed them\n\n01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:08.440\nBut yeah, the geese are the most aggressive so they'd come and they'd kind of swarm you and they really get like\n\n01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.840\nThey put their necks up like they're like trying to like square up with you to get food from you\n\n01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:17.440\nYeah, like they're they know you have food and they're trying to bully you. That's great\n\n01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:23.680\nAnd that seems like so territorial to them. Yeah, they're and they're stupid like they're just really angry and dumb\n\n01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:27.800\nLike it's a really loathsome animal trait like like like like there's you know\n\n01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:32.320\nThere's animals I understand animals coming at you and maybe scaring you because they want the food\n\n01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:39.440\nBut like an animal that's like like being mean to you because it wants your food. What a dick. Yeah, they're not they're not nice\n\n01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:45.080\nI geese are geese are lame, man. Wow. Yeah, they'll probably to bring it down, bro\n\n01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:48.720\nYeah, so thank you. I wonder if swans are like that\n\n01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:54.640\nI mean, isn't a swan just like a just like a like a fancy goose. I think yeah, I don't know man\n\n01:38:54.640 --> 01:39:01.160\nWhat about those swans man the swan check out the swan every swan ever try to get your bread man\n\n01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:08.840\nNo, no, no, but these swans. I feel like they don't get close to the swans. No, I don't know\n\n01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:16.520\nWhat do you guys think about like, you know how in hotels like? You\n\n01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:22.680\nNo matter how much or how little snacks are\n\n01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:31.840\nAvailable the Snickers bar is like the Gideon Bible of the hotel snack always there. So I wonder is that like a corporate?\n\n01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:34.600\nToe completely unrelated\n\n01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:40.280\nThat's got to be based on demand though, right? That's got to be some no, that's got to be demand\n\n01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:45.400\nThat's like the generic candy bar. I bet if you pulled candy bar Snickers is number one\n\n01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:50.520\nYeah, it's the one that you can count on not like a bunch of like snokers and snookers\n\n01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:56.580\nLike like like these ripoffs like how much how like wait wait like how come there's not like there's there's not really a lot of\n\n01:39:56.580 --> 01:40:00.620\nCandy bars that are very close to Snickers. I wonder if there's a fuck with that Mars candy bar\n\n01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:07.120\nAppropriation squatting like like yeah, like they just like if you try to add a certain amount of nougat to something they go like\n\n01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:12.820\nWe invented that and you're like I can't have nougat and they're like you can't have nougat I\n\n01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:18.900\nThink they invented nougat. So yeah, I think I think nougat's kind of a gray area, too\n\n01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:21.820\nWhat what what actually can look comprises nobody knows\n\n01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:24.380\nDelicious, and that's all we know\n\n01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:27.980\nTalking about nougat you eat it and then you get a new gut\n\n01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:31.340\nOh, no, that's great. That's a great job\n\n01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:35.020\nYeah\n\n01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:38.860\nIf you're talking to a child genius books are back down to $13\n\n01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:49.940\nAll right, but they're back to $15. All right, well, here we go. I talked about pee\n\n01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:52.980\nAnd come\n\n01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:59.940\nCome but Snickers are really satisfying the fucking best. Oh, man. They're a meal. I ate one on the way here\n\n01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:04.100\nI'm gonna have a little hey Dan remember when you and I had a deep-fried Mars bar in Scotland\n\n01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:09.120\nThat was fucking good. Yeah, I don't I don't do the myth of the deep-fried\n\n01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:14.700\nCommon-day items. I'm gonna put a little dent in that if I could they don't exist\n\n01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:24.060\nWell, I'm gonna have a deep-fried. It's a myth. I'm gonna have a deep-fried. Whatever. I'm gonna it comes at a deep-fried peanut butter cup\n\n01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:27.100\nIt's a it's a ball of fried\n\n01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:32.180\nBread or whatever the fuck they this it and you open it and it's just like it's just goop like come on\n\n01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:38.740\nIt's let's get real about what we're doing. I see the call you enjoying your deep-fried Mars bar when we were really drunk and well\n\n01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:46.780\nSure, yeah, it's delicious. Okay. Yeah, I'm not gonna eat that. So I won't eat that forensic files. It's goop in the middle\n\n01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:49.980\nI'm not eating this\n\n01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:52.860\nExcuse me miss. Will you please take this back?\n\n01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:58.460\nNo, I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna throw it in the garbage. It's a bunch of hot chocolatey mess\n\n01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:01.540\nBut it's not like it is not to my satisfaction\n\n01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:08.220\nHey, it's melted on the inside. Well, we put it in boiling oil, sir\n\n01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:11.340\nWhy did you do that?\n\n01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:15.580\nWhy did you do that?\n\n01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:22.460\nFive dollars get to the video subscription\n\n01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:32.860\nSo, you know at the you watch forensic files, you know, they always have to close the episode because it's always sad\n\n01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:38.140\nSomeone got murdered, you know, and so they can't end it with just the people because they can't go like yay\n\n01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:43.500\nWe solved the forensics like like go like like hurray. I was stuck in the closet. I\n\n01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:50.260\nWas stuck in the closet. We thought you were murdered. No, I was stuck in the closet\n\n01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:54.580\nI'm so hot in there and I've been eating a coat. I'm so\n\n01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:59.180\nSo they're stuck in the class that would have been a good episode. They don't do that\n\n01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:01.180\nBut they never do that because they should do that\n\n01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:07.340\nThey should do it once the the the second to last thing that happens is always the\n\n01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:10.180\nStuck in the closet\n\n01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:15.580\nThe murdered people's families they have to say like oh, we're so sad they got murdered and we always hang out\n\n01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:18.660\nThey're grave and we always like miss them and stuff and it sucks that they're dead\n\n01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:24.460\nAnd but you can't end the episode like that. So then they always need this like I don't know how come they have just figured it out\n\n01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:26.300\nI don't get people to say it\n\n01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:31.500\nBut it's I guess because it's hard for these cops and stuff because it always has to be like a cop that says it\n\n01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:35.340\nThey're not, you know, look if you're a cop and you're listening and you're a genius like\n\n01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:39.500\nemail me, but but like like I don't like like I\n\n01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:45.940\nYou know like I'm just saying there's been there's been court cases about the fact that they screen you for a high IQ and\n\n01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:51.260\nAnd and and not in the positive side like they're like because you tend to quit and waste taxpayers money\n\n01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:56.700\nBut but so these cops are kind of like, you know, and they live and then so then they are like they you want to close\n\n01:43:56.700 --> 01:44:01.780\nThe episode with them saying they just need to say that forensics like we're important\n\n01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:05.660\nAnd so they're always like they just like the music is rising up\n\n01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:11.420\nAnd it's like sometimes it takes them a really long time like they're going like this this was a case that\n\n01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:17.540\nWhere a person definitely did a bad thing and it's not done as much\n\n01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:22.420\nBut if it weren't if it weren't for for it for it for for science\n\n01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:29.620\nYou could just you just like sense the it's kind of funny. It's just like a thing. I wanted to talk about I\n\n01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:33.060\nJust I watch every episode forensic files\n\n01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:37.540\nI'm always like waiting for that part at the end where somebody's just like like you they're almost getting played off\n\n01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:42.820\nYou hear like the theme music coming up and they're just like like the this is a guy. Who's a bad guy?\n\n01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:46.340\nSay science. Yeah, exactly. They're like wait\n\n01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:51.700\nI just want him to say say like no at the you and you can tell that the way they start their quotes\n\n01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:58.100\nLike you could tell the interviewers are asking them like so do you think forensic science was crucial to this investigation?\n\n01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:01.020\nAnd they go yes, they go what could you?\n\n01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:09.180\nCan you put can you make the question part of the answer and so they go like I definitely think forensic science was important\n\n01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:11.500\nBecause when you have when you have a crime\n\n01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:19.540\nYou and and then the and then the police start, you know, we do we do things and and then but obviously that that poof\n\n01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:23.900\nThat that that that that that swab from her vagina like\n\n01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:29.740\nThat was that that really tied it up boom. Oh, man, you're a Jimmy Kimmel. I\n\n01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:39.460\nThe forensic files guy the voiceover guy, he's oh, I don't like that guy because he's always out of breath\n\n01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:43.220\nHe's like and then a guy came in. No, come on\n\n01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:47.140\nAnd and and then the door was opened. How do you know?\n\n01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:50.700\nThat guy is the show. How do you not like that guy?\n\n01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:54.620\nI don't like I don't like the guy. I like trying to bring some energy to the situation\n\n01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:59.620\nThey're dead people. It's a story about a person that got slashed to pieces of this energy already\n\n01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:05.100\nWhat I did what I like about that guy is that he picks it up at the end when they get to the point where they're like finally\n\n01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:09.420\nConclusively approved what the murder is and then he get the guy has to describe the murder\n\n01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:13.220\nSo out of empathy he starts amping it up or he's the guy who did it and he's really\n\n01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:20.800\nHard of beating a million miles in a second that'd be the greatest serial killer of all time who hosts his own show\n\n01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:26.820\nLike there's an arsonist that always goes back to the scene like watches the fire burn with the put with the fire department\n\n01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:30.500\nSo science has proven that that guy did it and\n\n01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:36.880\nJoin us next week. We're gonna get that little girls killer. Oh, she's not dead yet, but we'll get her\n\n01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:43.180\nThey also during the recap they incorporate all of the things like that they found\n\n01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:50.400\nForensically so they make it sound like the person doing the crime did all these really weird specific microscopic things like pulling into the driveway\n\n01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.680\nAngry about his girlfriend\n\n01:46:52.680 --> 01:47:00.080\nHe got out of the car and as he did his fingertips touched the edge of the door leaving the grease stains later found by police\n\n01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:07.440\nHe yanked her hair pulled her down the driveway leaving a slight trail of grease and dandruff\n\n01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:13.480\nThat the dog would lick up and that the dog pathologist would find in the dogs and testings\n\n01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.700\nAnyway, I'm not making my point clear. I don't know what my\n\n01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:21.880\nBut it is science events so far that we can find dead people's dandruff and a dogs and testings\n\n01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:25.880\nThey had a really sad dog one that would have really bummed you out dog\n\n01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:29.680\nGot the dog because I'm the only one that likes dogs. Yeah, no\n\n01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:35.320\nThat's it. The dog. You're the only one that like during our fascist takeover. You're like still tweeting like you said\n\n01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:37.320\nSo take it to a dog last week\n\n01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:40.800\nLast week you said there was a dog that got got shot\n\n01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:45.480\nBut then the dog got the dog got shot and then he still at the end\n\n01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:47.880\nHe got he tried to still he got shot\n\n01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:52.540\nThen he was like out of commission for a little bit and then the way that the guy got caught\n\n01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:55.300\nHe was a Samoan gangster named sable claws\n\n01:47:57.220 --> 01:48:02.940\nHow does it those gangs must be scary we've talked about that like cactus bunch and stuff like like if you're if you like these\n\n01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:06.860\nGangs that when those get those gangs that have like silly names like you're oh man\n\n01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:12.260\nThey must fucking just like I guess he was like in a Hannibal Lecter dolly in the court and it was just like I want to do it more\n\n01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:20.180\nBut sable claws got busted only because the dog that he shot his name was chief\n\n01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:26.620\nHe got shot in the fucking just like I guess he was like in a Hannibal Lecter dolly in the court\n\n01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:28.620\nAnd it was just like I want to do it more\n\n01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:31.340\nFuck sable claws\n\n01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:33.620\nYep\n\n01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:36.780\nBut not you know not because he's Samoan because he's a gangster\n\n01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:39.540\nSo I'll make that clear\n\n01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:43.300\nSamoans Samoans have provided us with a lot of like wonderful\n\n01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:45.660\npeople\n\n01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:50.860\nYes, Dwayne the Rock Johnson. I think is one of them. Maybe what are some of the inventions that Samoans?\n\n01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:57.740\nMade in history like famous inventions. They have a good cookie. That's the cookie\n\n01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:05.220\nThe cookies every year. Yeah, well a lot of people don't know that Ben Franklin's key was Samoan\n\n01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:21.260\nI mean who asked that that sounds like that's something you ask on a racist website. Who would it Samoans provide for us?\n\n01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:25.140\nI found I'm cracking the case. What an Harriet Tubman invent\n\n01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:32.900\nMaybe she didn't get a chance\n\n01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:39.980\nYou know, maybe Thomas Edison when he was born he was given like a bunch of light bulb assembly kits.
