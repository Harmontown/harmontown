00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
There we go, from Hollywood, California, a meltdown comic, Harmontown is now in session.

00:20.000 --> 00:39.000
Spencer Crittenden, and the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:39.000 --> 00:47.000
Hello. Hello. Thank you.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
All right. Well, we got a lot of show tonight. Not a lot of good show. I don't know that.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
I'm just saying we got a lot of guests and things. I'm not saying, oh, it's going to be a great show.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
I don't want to make promises like that. But sometimes I say it's going to be a bad show,

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
and then sometimes you feel like that's a good show. Who cares? You don't know.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
There's a big portion of our audience who hates when we have guests.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Oh, really? Yeah.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
What are they called? The Tories or the Wigs?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Bull Moosers.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Do you basing this on talking to them at karaoke after the show?

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Or are you basing this on Reddit? Are you a Reddit lurker?

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
I'm not a Reddit lurker. Some people say to me, oh, I love it when you have guests.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Some people say I hate when you have guests. I like it when it's just you, Dan, and Spencer.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah. I mean, you know, and sometimes if we don't have guests, it's a bad show,

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
because I'm like, I don't have anything to talk about, and I'm sluggish.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Sometimes if we do have guests, it's a good show because we do have guests.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Sometimes if we don't have guests, it's a good show in spite of having no guests.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
You can live by the guest and die by the guest.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Yeah. I mean, who knows? Sometimes people come up and we get to know them,

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
and sometimes they're a big dud. Sometimes they're...

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Sometimes the people in the live venue, sorry, that was probably...

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Vod cannot spit, but...

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Sometimes people in the live venue enjoy the people that come up

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
and people that are listening at home are like, fuck that guy, I hate him.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
But let's... Well, let's spend this...

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
Let's spend this personal time before we bring out our guests wisely.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
I want to ask you a couple questions.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
Hmm. Oh, yeah. Okay.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
You became kind of Bruce Willis there.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
There's a... Okay, so does anybody know anything about pee?

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
When a pee coming out of a penis, a human male penis,

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
that twist right by the...

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Is that because, I'm imagining, I'm not a physicist,

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
but that's because it's shooting out at a high velocity in the shape of a wall,

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
like a vertical wall, and then gravity is doing its thing,

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
and it's leveling out, and it's also, at the same time,

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
coalescing into a cylinder of pee.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
I think there's kind of two streams that strike each other,

03:08.000 --> 03:17.000
and their combined force kind of sends them in a spiral around each other until they land.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Or like one of those water fountains sometimes do it,

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
where there's two separate holes and they kind of strike each other.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
I assume it's to get more, you know, distance out of it.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Hello, Spencer, how are you tonight?

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Are you saying that it's like the Coriolis effect?

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
It's absolutely the Coriolis effect.

03:39.000 --> 03:47.000
That people's men's pee out of their penises south of the equator spirals the other way

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
because of the rotation of the Earth?

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah, when we were in Australia, it was like that.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
When you guys, ladies forgive us for a moment,

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
when you guys have the comings, you know, when you ejaculate,

04:06.000 --> 04:15.000
when you make your leavings, and then if you, let's say it's a hot summer day,

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
and you're already tired, and so you just kind of like,

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
you don't do any self-care, you just sort of drift off to sleep,

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
which I did once in my 20s when I was living in Koreatown,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
and I really just value my candor.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
No, don't value it, hate me.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
But I remember, this is a sad chapter of my life,

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
it was so fucking hot, and I lived in this little two-foot closet in our house in Koreatown,

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
and I masturbated, and I just passed out on my bare mattress,

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
and I had masturbated on to like a piece of newspaper,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
and I just put it over onto the side of my bed,

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
and I just drifted into a semi-blissful, semi-chronically depressed, sad,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
like, when do I have to move back to Milwaukee sleep?

05:06.000 --> 05:13.000
And I woke up, and there was just this carpet of ants, just like...

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
And it just made me feel like I was in an Irish poem or something about,

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
like, that hoser song or whatever,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
and I went, after the insects have made their claim,

05:26.000 --> 05:34.000
after the raven has wet his beak, I'll be home with you, I'll be home with you.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Now, I was just listening to Skulljuice with Dino's Temetopolis.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Yeah, they were talking about that.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
They talk about the fact, I did not know this,

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
that if you leave your jizz rag out, the ants will come,

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
and I did not know that ants love... come.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
I think the ants that we get a lot are like piss ants, right?

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
They love bathroom stuff, they eat piss, they drink piss.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
They're a lot like Donald Trump in that way.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Imagine being an ant.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
What a life the ants life, you know?

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
It's like, we really have to ask ourselves,

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
like, what are we shooting for? No pun intended.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
We as primates are shooting for the ants,

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
and the ants are there to gather it all

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
and take every protein-charged flake back to their brood.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
And they've been here since before the dinosaurs,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
and so in some respects we're tempted to say,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
oh, the ants have won, they've won.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
It's their planet, right?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Because they're not going to go anywhere,

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
and then we're going to come and go,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
but we're going to come and then we're going to go.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
But like...

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Cummings and leavings.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
But what kind of life is that?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
That's not a life.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
I'd rather be a super intelligent monkey

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
that just like rises up and spits in God's eye.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
That's a good point, yeah.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
It's better to be a human than an ant.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
I think it's a bold stance, but I agree.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
But we're presenting a unified front here.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
We're the only animal that has a philosophy,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
an evolutionary strategy that is proofed

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
against the death of this planet,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
and also one that is causing it.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
But we are the only ones, as I've said,

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
I don't see any big plans coming out of giraffes these days.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
They ain't got no rocket ships,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
and we're just saying we're the one animal

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
that actually theoretically you could blow up the whole planet,

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
and we'd be like, over here, we're not there yet,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
but I'm just saying we should be proud of ourselves.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
We shouldn't aspire to be ants.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
And when I look at our freeways

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
and our public schooling systems,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I think we're aspiring to be ants,

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
and we shouldn't do that.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Our next guest...

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Dan, before you bring out a guest,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
real quick, point of order.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Spencer and I were talking about...

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I don't want to slow down the show.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Before we bring out our guest,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
we've been talking and we keep forgetting about it,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
about starting a new D&D campaign.

07:56.000 --> 08:03.000
Let's lay the groundwork right now

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
for getting this rolling,

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
because we have a million guests tonight.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
You mean like in the interest of next week?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Yeah, next show.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Let's talk about how we proceed with this now,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
so we're ready to start rocking on this as we go forward.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
All right, well, one thing before that...

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Electric Boogaloo!

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Because I never really finished my thought.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I know people at home are like, oh, he never got there.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Sometimes if you're a guy,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
and you do your thing,

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
and then you don't do anything else,

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
then you forget.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
You go to the bathroom and you go pee,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
and it's this amazing double,

08:40.000 --> 08:47.000
like, Legolas' Elven Arrow thing.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
And you wait for it.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
You're like, have you ever had that happen?

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
And then you're like, well, I'm not going to...

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
It's because it hurts to stop.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I know, smallest violin in the world

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
for the half of the gender

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
that's destroyed our species,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
but it hurts.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
You don't want to stop.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
So you just kind of like,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
you try to push through it.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
You figure like, well, it's...

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Why don't you give me a break?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
What could possibly be going on down there

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
that could keep these two streams separate?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
And so you put a little more pressure on it,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
and then it's just like too dry,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
and it's just like going everywhere with a toilet.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
And I mean, it's pretty steadfast,

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
that I'm assuming it's just a little super glue

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
that you made in servicing that selfish gene.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
So you're talking about when you're close to coming,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
then it's hard to pee?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
No.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
No, he's saying...

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Am I that bad at making that?

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
No, he's saying that there was still some left in there.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Afterward.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
You come, and then you go to sleep.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
And while you sleep, it dries.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
So you haven't done it, and then you go pee,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
and the tip of your wiener,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
the hole, I believe, is probably just glued in the middle.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Right. Okay.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
No, that's true.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Yeah.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
No, I believe it.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
I didn't want to...

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I tried to be quaint with my language.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
I didn't want to get all clinical and grody about it.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I need that.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
All right.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
So talking about D&D,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
well, we have to decide like what character.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I mean, I will throw that to you and Spencer.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Like, Spencer, what do you think?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Yeah.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Yeah, what kind of characters do you want?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I'm thinking your guys are...

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
your emissaries of a church that is like going into strange lands.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Well, what's our platform?

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Are we doing Pathfinder?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Let's just do Pathfinder.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Okay.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Are we allowed to?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Like, see so why?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Oh, I talk to those guys.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
I use my plus two cloak of charisma.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
And also a scroll of fireball.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
That was great.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
All right.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Okay.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
So go on.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
You want us to be emissaries of what?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Yeah.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
So I don't want to tell the story of the story that I want to tell.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
But yeah, you guys are your adventurers,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
but you're from some sort of church.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
You don't have to be like believers of the church.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
You could be like, you know,

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
employees or contract laborers from the church or something.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
But you're a team from the church.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Yeah.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
So it's like Book of Mormon.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Yeah, that's what it's going to be.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Book of Mormon.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Well, I think I would like to be a very devout,

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
I know I could be like a hit man hired by the church

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
or a paladin that represents the church,

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
but it's all into, I think I would like to be,

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
because I kind of, I think my thing would,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
I would like to be certain about things.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
I would like to know exactly what I'm supposed to do.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
I'm not saying from you,

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
I just mean like I would like to play a character

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
that gives me the relaxing, refreshing thing

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
of not being conflicted and confused.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
And I'd like to like know like, oh, I have a religion.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And I'd like to know what the tenets of that religion are.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
I mean, I'll make them up.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
But if, you know, I'm not asking you to write me a religion.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
I'm just saying like, I'd like to be a cleric.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Yeah, okay, great.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
A cleric of that church, right?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Of that church that we're talking about.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Yeah.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Now, is it possible to still be Chad the Fire Liker

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
from the San Francisco show?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Yeah, definitely.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
Okay, but I was, in that show, I was an elf druid.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
But I like your drawing that you made

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
when he was a gnome druid.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Sure.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
So I might modify and be the gnome druid version

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
of Chad the Fire Liker.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Great.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Whatever you like.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
I like that.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
I like it a lot.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
All right.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Okay.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
So do you want to, you want to like,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
roll us like attributes and stats and things like that?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Yeah, that might take a week or two or something.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
But also I think maybe we should make Steve Levy a character,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
but I could handle that off Mike maybe.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Yeah, that's good.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
And so then we just have three dudes, but here's the thing.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
Like, like gender imbalance might,

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
with consistency might be better than like,

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
we used to have Aaron.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Yeah.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
We could use, you know, but like,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
I think what we all agreed upon after a while is that

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
these things keep falling apart because we keep rotating.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Right.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
We don't need, we don't need people.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
We want to have consistency.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
We want it to be like a, like a, like a radio show.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
And then it's like, oh, here's another chapter of this.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
And everybody that played last week played this week.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
And so that we have that kind of consistency.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
It's also very common for when people are missing,

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
just to have them be missing.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
That's, that's something that happens in games.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
So we just do that.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Well, but not if you didn't anticipate them being missing.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
I don't know.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
We got, we got bogged down because sometimes Camille would not be here

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
and then Demorge would be here and then not be here.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
And Curtis would, you know, like come and go and Aaron would come and go

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
and then went because, so it's, I think it's hard to keep track

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
of a weekly show when the, when the half the cast is never there.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
So.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Right.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Yeah.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
We had a golden age when it was just like a core.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
So like Steve could play a woman or I could play a woman, you know,

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
but it wouldn't be true balance in terms of casting,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
but it would be in terms of the mythology.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
We could have like NPCs come up and be women or something.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Is that just pandering?

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
I think it's like, like, well, well, just all right.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
I'm sorry.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
I brought it up.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
No, that's the thing.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
I didn't want to buy it.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
We have way too much show.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Way too much show.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Too much show.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
But we've talked about it.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
No, we're good.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
It's happening.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
It's moving forward.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Oh, like as it stands right now, you and I have characters,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
possibly Steve Levy and that's moving forward.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Yeah.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
All right.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Now let's figure out the rest.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Let's get on with the cavalcade of stars.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Okay.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
Our first guest is a modern veteran of the television directing trenches.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
He's directed many, many episodes of Always Sunny.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
He's done tons of acting, too.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
We can talk to him about that.

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
But the most noteworthy thing is his movie, Fist Fight, is coming out February 17th.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
I think it's got Charlie Day and Ice Cube in it.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
And let's bring him out my new friend, Richie Keen.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Did I get that right?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
February 17th.

14:58.000 --> 15:11.000
I'm so bummed I wasn't out here because you talked about two very important subjects.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Yeah.

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
And you pivoted amazingly from pissing to D&D, back to the double stream, back to D&D.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I'm passionate about both these issues.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
I'm an OG D&D.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
I'm Gary Gygax, first edition D&D.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
And ladies, for those of you who don't understand the double stream,

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
there's women who are always wondering what's happened in there.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Why can't you hit it?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Yeah, they think we're...

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
This is something that's not...

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
You kind of just took the hit for everyone and got it out into the world.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
I appreciate that.

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
But I don't want to hide behind, oh, my dick was glued shut every time.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Right.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
We're also weird, lazy giants that can't fucking keep it in the bowl.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I feel like this could be your thing.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
This could be a cause.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Yes, this could be your...

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
You could really get in front of this.

16:06.000 --> 16:16.000
I wonder if shorter men are more popular with women in terms of toiletry and hygiene.

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
If a girl went out with a seven-foot guy and then goes out with a five-foot-five guy,

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
if she's like, oh, Michael's so clean.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
He's so clean that they don't even really think.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Yeah, it's probably like...

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Size is important.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
The closer you're hanging...

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Down there closer.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
This is so exciting.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
You don't have to be taller.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
I'm almost six foot four.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
And when I'm at home, I generally sit because it's time too far away.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
This is another important issue.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
You're sitting.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I'm tall about ten.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
First of all, blessed is he that can sit down, as the Scandinavian poet once said.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Sitting is great.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
We invented chairs for a reason.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
They're important things.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
But I'm going to splash.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I'm too goddamn far away.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
Even if I nail it, even if I'm completely hitting the clown's mouth of the carnival,

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
making the balloon go up, I'm still just...

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
My reward for hitting the water in the middle of the bowl and not hitting the seat

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
is refractory pee or toilet water coming out.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
You're very passionate about this.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
I can see this.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I want to do the right thing.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
I want to do the right thing.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
I'm a nighttime sitter.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Really?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
I sit at night.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
In the middle of the night, if I got to get up, I don't want to put the light on.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
It's going to be a disaster.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
I only pee sitting when it turns out I have to pee.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
When I have to take a poop, and then I'm like, oh, I had to take a pee.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
See, I'm a nighttime sit-down peer, but I'm a nighttime stand-up pooper.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I stand a stand-up pooper.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
That is a...

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
You're a rare breed.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
That's a mic drop.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
That's a mic drop on the subjects.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
All right.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
Well, okay.

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
So how did your career start, Richie, now that you're our new Hollywood friend?

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
Because you're about to blow up because this movie's probably very funny.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
We talked about three o'clock high a lot.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
I don't know.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Some amazing movie.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
Some of the older fogies in the audience remember this movie, Three O'Clock High,

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
that was kind of like this cult hit.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
It didn't really like...

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
It didn't make a huge splash.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
There weren't nine sequels.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
I don't even remember...

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
I met the actor that played the bully, I told you, at a party at Sam Simon's house,

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
and he looked identical, but I can't remember the actor's name.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Richard Tyson.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Okay.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Amazing.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Is he here?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
What the hell?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
That's it.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
That was...

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
My name is Richard Tyson.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
Frank Johnson from Johnson Management.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Also, I was in other movies.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
I have two clients.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Sparkles the Horse.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
I was in other films, too.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
All right, we're talking over each other tonight.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
How are we having...

18:42.000 --> 18:48.000
Well, Three O'Clock High also, in an era of John Hughes movies where there was a lot

18:48.000 --> 18:53.800
of hearts and a lot of big comedy, Three O'Clock High came out in that time, and it was dark

18:53.800 --> 18:57.500
and just edgy, and the cinematography was so interesting.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.500
It had more...

18:58.500 --> 19:02.520
I remember seeing somebody talking about, you know, I don't know, directors forgive me

19:02.520 --> 19:03.520
for a second.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.520
I think they're very silly people.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.520
They are.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.520
That's a fair point.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.400
They're confusing to me because they think about things I don't think about.

19:09.400 --> 19:15.440
So when you meet a good one or one that understands you, I grab them and hug them and go, please

19:15.440 --> 19:23.520
keep working with me forever, Justin Lin, okay, go do nine Fast and Furious movies.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.760
But why didn't I talk...

19:25.760 --> 19:31.320
So I was watching, Hitchcock, Hitchcock, like he was...

19:31.320 --> 19:32.680
He fucked with you more.

19:32.680 --> 19:35.800
It was like you were in the hands of a madman a little bit.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.400
There's all these different ways to talk about directing, like the philosophies, and Three

19:39.400 --> 19:40.400
O'Clock High.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.000
John Hughes, I think maybe he...

19:43.000 --> 19:48.320
If you researched it, and maybe you have, but he probably did things with his cameras

19:48.320 --> 19:55.320
and his cutting that made you feel like you were on not only John Hughes' side, but that

19:55.320 --> 20:00.640
John Hughes was on the character's side, whereas Hitchcock, for instance, and then also whoever

20:00.640 --> 20:05.560
directed Three O'Clock High, they were kind of intentionally going, you don't know who

20:05.560 --> 20:06.560
side I'm on.

20:06.560 --> 20:07.560
I agree.

20:07.560 --> 20:08.560
Hitchcock really did fuck with you a lot.

20:08.560 --> 20:12.400
I mean, you see a movie like Psycho where you're supposed to be on one person's side

20:12.400 --> 20:15.960
in 20 minutes and she's killed, and you're like, oh, fuck, what just happened?

20:15.960 --> 20:20.880
And John Hughes, I agree, was very much very clear about whose side he was on.

20:20.880 --> 20:24.080
It was the first time I was conscious as a kid in a movie theater watching Three O'Clock

20:24.080 --> 20:29.400
High of all these like weird like dolly shots, like just kind of almost needlessly, it was

20:29.400 --> 20:31.320
like, oh, that's a weird thing to do with the camera.

20:31.320 --> 20:34.960
And apparently it was based on high noon, I assume, which I've never seen.

20:34.960 --> 20:39.520
But because of the idea was, in the beginning of Three O'Clock High, the innocent kind of

20:39.520 --> 20:45.320
like sweater clad, neb-ish character, not necessarily a nerd, but certainly not a jock.

20:45.320 --> 20:49.880
He's just sort of a middleman in his high school biosphere, and he somehow accidentally

20:49.880 --> 20:50.880
offends this.

20:50.880 --> 20:51.880
He touches him.

20:51.880 --> 20:52.880
That's the big rule.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.880
You can't touch him.

20:53.880 --> 20:57.960
And he says something like they run into each other at the urinal, and he says, I forget

20:57.960 --> 21:03.440
what he says, but he slaps him on the back and, you know, Buddy Ravel turns around.

21:03.440 --> 21:04.440
Buddy Ravel.

21:04.440 --> 21:07.000
And he's fucked for the rest of the day.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.160
And it was kind of like, that was after Ferris Bueller, right?

21:09.160 --> 21:15.400
I assume that movie, because the guy was kind of, he looked, he had a broader look to him.

21:15.400 --> 21:19.880
And he was sort of a, I think the thought balloon above his head, like everyone in the

21:19.880 --> 21:22.840
audience was, I wish I was Ferris Bueller.

21:22.840 --> 21:26.120
But why is it that when I try to be Ferris Bueller, I end up in the crosshairs of the

21:26.120 --> 21:32.360
most terrifying man, this 35-year-old senior, who now is going to see me after school at

21:32.360 --> 21:36.560
three o'clock, and the rest of the movie is just a psychological examination of your unraveling

21:36.560 --> 21:38.640
as you wait for three o'clock to show up.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.560
But an amazing journey to a lot.

21:40.560 --> 21:44.400
Like, I remember as a kid just being, like, mesmerized by that movie.

21:44.400 --> 21:48.400
Our movie is nothing like that, aside from the concept of there's going to be a fight

21:48.400 --> 21:49.400
after school.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.400
But I love Three O'Clock Eye.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.400
I mean, I just think it's such a, it's such a movie worth revisiting, because-

21:53.400 --> 21:55.400
Well, I wouldn't have brought it up if I thought it was nothing like it.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.400
Yeah.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.400
Okay.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.400
All right.

21:58.400 --> 22:02.320
Well, no, I mean, the log line is very similar, which is there's going to be a fight after

22:02.320 --> 22:03.320
school.

22:03.320 --> 22:07.000
This just happens to be two teachers, and not two students, and what happens along the

22:07.000 --> 22:09.160
way is very different.

22:09.160 --> 22:13.440
But it's a similar sort of, what the fuck would you do?

22:13.440 --> 22:19.840
The difference, I think, in fist fight is even though Ice Cube goes a step too far early

22:19.840 --> 22:26.080
in the movie, as you go through the movie, if I did my job, and I hope I did, you might

22:26.080 --> 22:32.300
be on his side as he continues talking about why he wants to do this, and as Charlie starts

22:32.300 --> 22:36.360
to be sketchier and sketchier in his methodology of getting out of it.

22:36.360 --> 22:42.640
So, it's a little bit more by the time you get to this big fight, I think my hope is

22:42.640 --> 22:46.840
that you're sort of kind of like, oh, I don't know who I want to see win, and how this is

22:46.840 --> 22:47.840
going to go down.

22:47.840 --> 22:51.760
Whereas, I think in Three O'Clock Eye, you want him to get those brass knuckles and knock

22:51.760 --> 22:52.760
Buddy Ravel out.

22:52.760 --> 22:53.760
Right.

22:53.760 --> 22:54.760
It's quit, you know, if you can.

22:54.760 --> 22:55.760
Yeah.

22:55.760 --> 22:56.760
Did you remember My Bodyguard?

22:56.760 --> 22:57.760
Of course.

22:57.760 --> 22:58.760
Yeah, okay.

22:58.760 --> 22:59.760
I grew up in Chicago.

22:59.760 --> 23:00.760
All those movies.

23:00.760 --> 23:01.760
I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago.

23:01.760 --> 23:02.960
I grew up in a huge country.

23:02.960 --> 23:06.240
They were filming Ferris Bueller when I was a kid in my hometown.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.240
My Bodyguard.

23:07.240 --> 23:08.720
Those were all the movies of my youth.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.800
I like about Three O'Clock Eye, because I love that movie, too.

23:11.800 --> 23:14.440
But also, is it a play on Twelve O'Clock Eye?

23:14.440 --> 23:18.960
It's not just Three O'Clock High School, like Three O'Clock High, but it's also like Twelve

23:18.960 --> 23:19.960
O'Clock High.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.560
It's a war film, right?

23:21.560 --> 23:22.560
Oh, wait.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.560
Oh, there's a movie called Twelve O'Clock Eye.

23:24.560 --> 23:28.440
Yeah, there's an old war film from the 40s or 50s.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.560
And Twelve O'Clock Eye, it's like, he's Twelve O'Clock High.

23:30.560 --> 23:33.880
It's like fighter pilots talking about, like you're being attacked, like Three O'Clock

23:33.880 --> 23:34.880
High.

23:34.880 --> 23:35.880
I knew it was a high noon.

23:35.880 --> 23:39.840
I mean, I took Three O'Clock High, like look to your three, and he's up there.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.640
You have someone coming at you at Three O'Clock High.

23:41.640 --> 23:45.360
Well, the focus is really on the time, so I just assumed that it was a high noon, because

23:45.360 --> 23:49.280
I'm sure high noon is like, oh, at noon you're gonna fucking gunfight.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.280
But school gets out at three o'clock.

23:51.280 --> 23:53.800
That's what I'm saying, and you can't say high three o'clock.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.320
You guys are agreeing, and you don't know it.

23:55.320 --> 23:56.320
Right.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.720
I want to step in and help.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.640
I'm asking, I don't know if I'm conflating to things.

24:00.640 --> 24:05.480
I don't know if that was an intentional war movie called Twelve O'Clock.

24:05.480 --> 24:06.480
No one knows.

24:06.480 --> 24:07.480
It wasn't.

24:07.480 --> 24:08.480
There wasn't.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.480
He's fucking drunk again.

24:09.480 --> 24:15.880
You're like this, I said modern veteran, because I didn't want to say veteran TV director,

24:15.880 --> 24:21.640
because then it sounds like you're 70, but you're, I mean, the TV director's life is

24:21.640 --> 24:26.480
like very hand-to-mouth traveling, like Samurai.

24:26.480 --> 24:28.440
Billy Lohman style.

24:28.440 --> 24:33.160
You're never, I mean, as a guy who ran one of these shows, you never directed a community,

24:33.160 --> 24:34.160
but you do.

24:34.160 --> 24:35.160
I wish I had.

24:35.160 --> 24:40.120
But like, the directors are like, we treat them like substitute math teachers, like even

24:40.120 --> 24:45.120
the principal, if I could call myself that, treats them like substitute teachers, like

24:45.120 --> 24:51.120
it's like, oh, welcome, shithead, get it done, and then they go down into the hot box with

24:51.120 --> 24:55.480
the actors who are on their 80th episode, and the actors are like, I got this, like

24:55.480 --> 24:56.480
watch this.

24:56.480 --> 24:57.480
I call it the Allison.

24:57.480 --> 25:01.720
Yeah, like, they direct themselves if they're worth their salt, and they'll like, they'll

25:01.720 --> 25:06.520
bust the director's balls, and they make friends with some of them, and they torture some of

25:06.520 --> 25:08.520
them.

25:08.520 --> 25:10.480
But every show is different.

25:10.480 --> 25:14.960
Every show is really different, and that's what's, there's certain shows that you come

25:14.960 --> 25:18.320
into, and it's like, they want your help.

25:18.320 --> 25:21.320
When I do, it's always something in Philadelphia, they're like, what do you want to do with

25:21.320 --> 25:22.320
this?

25:22.320 --> 25:23.320
What's your take?

25:23.320 --> 25:24.320
What should we play with?

25:24.320 --> 25:27.640
What's your plan, you know, and we'll do what you want.

25:27.640 --> 25:31.520
Shameless is like, making a movie, they're just like, go do whatever you want.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.960
John Wallace doesn't even have the writers on set.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.960
You know, the Goldbergs, you're there to help.

25:36.960 --> 25:37.960
I'm there to help.

25:37.960 --> 25:38.960
I'm sure.

25:38.960 --> 25:39.960
Adam Goldberg.

25:39.960 --> 25:41.080
I'm there to help his vision.

25:41.080 --> 25:44.120
So, and they're all fun and different.

25:44.120 --> 25:49.320
It's really for me about point of view, someone who has a strong point of view that I could,

25:49.320 --> 25:55.240
that I understand, and I can help and hopefully be additive, and there are certain gigs where

25:55.240 --> 26:00.120
you're there just to help, and there are certain gigs where they need your help, and it's always

26:00.120 --> 26:01.120
different.

26:01.120 --> 26:05.560
And I was a private acting coach and acting teacher for a long time, and so I love to

26:05.560 --> 26:06.560
mix it up.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.640
When I hear someone's difficult, I'm like, let me in there.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.440
When I hear an actor, oh, this actor's tough.

26:11.440 --> 26:12.440
This actor's just really difficult.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.960
I'm like, I can't wait.

26:13.960 --> 26:14.960
Like that's fun for me.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.600
I know I'm going to reach that person.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.080
I know I'm going to find a way.

26:18.080 --> 26:21.800
I always do, and it's like, that's really joyful for me.

26:21.800 --> 26:27.160
Yeah, well, with Chevy the way into his, into his, I've heard the stories.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.280
There would be directors that he would be like, is she coming back?

26:29.280 --> 26:30.280
I love her.

26:30.280 --> 26:33.880
You know, they'd be like, why does Chevy love that, that director, this director?

26:33.880 --> 26:38.040
And it was like, they, you know, they weren't bad directors, but they were just like, they

26:38.040 --> 26:42.120
saw the writing on the wall and were like, nailed it Chevy, and like, like, let's shoot

26:42.120 --> 26:43.120
Chevy out.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.920
You know, like, and he was like, I love that person.

26:45.920 --> 26:52.880
Anyways, but I did want to ask you, like, so, so you're, you're kind of a man without

26:52.880 --> 26:56.200
a country when you're, you're coming in because unless you direct a pilot, I don't know how

26:56.200 --> 27:02.280
many people that are listening that are interested in working in TV versus features, no, like,

27:02.280 --> 27:07.280
unless you direct a pilot, you're not really, you know, you don't have ownership creatively

27:07.280 --> 27:09.440
or in actuality over that show.

27:09.440 --> 27:13.400
So you are just coming in and you have like this really stringent period of time to shoot

27:13.400 --> 27:16.000
your episode, to prep your episode, to shoot your episode.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.680
And then you have like a little temporary office that's never going to be the best one.

27:19.680 --> 27:23.040
It's like, there's no potted plant, director from last week has their shit still there.

27:23.040 --> 27:27.080
There's like, there's like, scrawled switchblade carvings in the wall that are like, like,

27:27.080 --> 27:31.800
like, don't eat the beans or the cake is a lie.

27:31.800 --> 27:35.520
The, the, but you, and then, and then you have to, you know, it's like, you're always

27:35.520 --> 27:36.520
under the gun.

27:36.520 --> 27:40.560
There's like all this shit probably politically, like trickling down and you're not, the wine

27:40.560 --> 27:45.120
producer might show up on the set and say, Oh, always, you got to eliminate three shots

27:45.120 --> 27:46.120
and all this stuff.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.760
So then you have to have this like clinical relationship with it.

27:48.760 --> 27:51.760
And then you have to do your director's cut and you have like a week to do that, right?

27:51.760 --> 27:55.240
And then at the end of that week, no matter where you're at with that edit, you got to

27:55.240 --> 27:57.040
go do another show.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.160
Otherwise you won't pay your rent, right?

27:59.160 --> 28:06.080
So I guess my question is how within that weird clinical morass, how do you find the

28:06.080 --> 28:07.080
pride?

28:07.080 --> 28:08.080
How do you find the empathy?

28:08.080 --> 28:09.680
How do you find the passion?

28:09.680 --> 28:13.920
It's like any portfolio of work or anything.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.520
You do a pilot and you have ownership.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.360
I have a pilot that I did a couple of years ago.

28:17.360 --> 28:18.360
It's still going.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.360
It's paying for my wedding.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.360
Okay.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.680
Then you go do an episode of a show that you really love the people on and you're there

28:23.680 --> 28:28.240
to help and you're cool with whatever the show runner does with your edit.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.760
Then you go make a movie and it's a year and a half of your life and it's all yours.

28:31.760 --> 28:33.880
And there's pros and cons truly to all of them.

28:33.880 --> 28:41.680
So for me, I started so late that it's a miracle that I get to do any of it.

28:41.680 --> 28:42.920
I was a comic.

28:42.920 --> 28:43.920
I was an actor.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.680
I was an acting teacher.

28:45.680 --> 28:50.760
So for me, that anyone wanted my help to begin with, I'm one of those annoyingly truly

28:50.760 --> 28:54.200
grateful people who can't believe he gets to do it at all.

28:54.200 --> 29:00.320
And so it's a bonus when I come be a guest on a show and they're like, what do you think?

29:00.320 --> 29:04.120
And I find that that happens not more and more as I return to the same shows over and

29:04.120 --> 29:05.120
over again.

29:05.120 --> 29:10.720
But how do you keep from falling into the sand traps of either A, getting so excited about

29:10.720 --> 29:14.480
this episode of Sonny in Philadelphia, you're like, this is going to be fucking amazing.

29:14.480 --> 29:19.000
But I needed more time and I didn't have more time like, how do you keep from throwing a

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
shoe and going like, no, I need, let me do, let me take the weekend in the edit bay.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.560
Like I'm almost done with my director's cut.

29:25.560 --> 29:26.560
That happens.

29:26.560 --> 29:33.080
And I'm lucky that the shows I work on are shows I really dig and I really dig the showrunners.

29:33.080 --> 29:39.120
So if there's a situation where I feel like, if I could just get a little more time, either

29:39.120 --> 29:43.520
I'll ask for it or I know they're going to, they're going to elevate it.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.960
So why am I fighting?

29:45.960 --> 29:51.480
What's frustrating is when a line producer understandably is worried about something

29:51.480 --> 29:56.100
that I know you need and you're in the writing room and you're not there.

29:56.100 --> 29:59.800
And that's a very tricky political situation and I know I have to get it.

29:59.800 --> 30:03.280
And then I just have to be difficult and say, sorry, bro, I'm shooting it.

30:03.280 --> 30:10.440
And, but I don't, everyone's while I throw a shoe, everyone's while my best self doesn't

30:10.440 --> 30:13.680
come out because of the things we're talking about.

30:13.680 --> 30:20.840
But for the most part in television, I'm there to help unless it's a show like the ones I

30:20.840 --> 30:27.880
do a lot of, which is no coincidence, where they feel they want my additive value.

30:27.880 --> 30:28.880
Does that make sense?

30:28.880 --> 30:29.880
Yeah.

30:29.880 --> 30:30.880
Jesus Christ, was that boring?

30:30.880 --> 30:31.880
Yeah.

30:31.880 --> 30:32.880
Let's go back to pissing and D&D.

30:32.880 --> 30:37.200
Well, why don't we, why don't we spice things up by bringing some of your Chicago friends

30:37.200 --> 30:40.680
out here or fellow Chicago natives?

30:40.680 --> 30:48.760
I think we'll, as I understand it, we have, do we have, I mean, this shit gets dropped

30:48.760 --> 30:51.840
on me like a fucking sandbag.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.840
Not in charge of when shit goes wrong.

30:53.840 --> 30:56.840
I'm only in charge of when shit goes right.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.760
That's a nice, that's a good job.

30:58.760 --> 31:01.840
I think that was on Harry Truman's desk on that little sign.

31:01.840 --> 31:02.840
It's certainly on Trump's.

31:02.840 --> 31:06.840
I mean, well, why don't we, let's, let's bring Dino Sabatopoulos out.

31:06.840 --> 31:07.840
Yeah.

31:07.840 --> 31:12.840
No, you don't have to move down.

31:12.840 --> 31:22.840
All right, Dino's doing lines in the back.

31:22.840 --> 31:36.400
Wow, you're going to be careful with those.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.520
I'm in big trouble, buddy.

31:38.520 --> 31:39.520
What happened?

31:39.520 --> 31:45.000
I did this graphic novel like 20 years ago and you had an artist work for three years

31:45.000 --> 31:48.840
on it and hardcover and hi, Richie.

31:48.840 --> 31:52.880
You guys, I was his intern in 1994, that's a true story.

31:52.880 --> 31:58.640
I didn't, I wasn't sure he was my intern, but then I made him say, hey, can you read

31:58.640 --> 31:59.640
my script, please?

31:59.640 --> 32:00.640
Yeah.

32:00.640 --> 32:01.640
And then I knew exactly who it was.

32:01.640 --> 32:02.640
It was me.

32:02.640 --> 32:03.640
It's a true story.

32:03.640 --> 32:10.640
Uh, I made 2000, we printed 2000 of these and no one's going to buy them.

32:10.640 --> 32:11.640
I got a fucking copy.

32:11.640 --> 32:12.640
I'm sure that's not true, Dino.

32:12.640 --> 32:13.640
Woo.

32:13.640 --> 32:14.640
I feel like it's like an infomercial.

32:14.640 --> 32:19.280
No, believe me, I fucking, I brought my guitar, I'm going to like, I'm going to do it like

32:19.280 --> 32:21.360
a little monkey tap dance here.

32:21.360 --> 32:23.640
I brought Scott Attson and Brita Phillips.

32:23.640 --> 32:24.640
Oh, yeah.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.800
I heard a gasp.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.240
They're way more popular than me.

32:29.240 --> 32:35.240
You mean Pete Hornberger from 30 Rock and the, the singer whose name I stole for the

32:35.240 --> 32:36.240
character of a Brita.

32:36.240 --> 32:37.240
That's right.

32:37.240 --> 32:38.240
Yeah.

32:38.240 --> 32:40.480
I was going to bring IO Perry too.

32:40.480 --> 32:44.760
The other half of the name, like who's, who's foibles I stole for the car.

32:44.760 --> 32:45.760
Yeah.

32:45.760 --> 32:46.760
She's in my band.

32:46.760 --> 32:47.760
Sorry about everything.

32:47.760 --> 32:48.760
That's the name.

32:48.760 --> 32:49.760
No applause.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.760
Nothing.

32:50.760 --> 32:54.920
Because they don't know what you're talking about.

32:54.920 --> 32:57.800
I mean, you're late, you're late blooming, which is an exciting thing.

32:57.800 --> 33:03.400
I started a band at 52, fucking nightmare.

33:03.400 --> 33:11.840
We're doing a gig actually on Saturday at, at star burns at, at super tight and my drummer,

33:11.840 --> 33:14.800
our drummer, it's not my band, it's our band.

33:14.800 --> 33:18.080
And the drummer couldn't make it because it's his birthday and he planned this thing,

33:18.080 --> 33:21.280
you know, in Vegas for, he said, whatever you do, don't have a show on the 18th and

33:21.280 --> 33:23.120
now we have a show on the 18th.

33:23.120 --> 33:29.160
And so I was on Facebook and one, a couple of my friends who were married and fucked

33:29.160 --> 33:35.360
and had a baby and the baby grew up to be 12 years old and now he's drumming on Facebook.

33:35.360 --> 33:38.560
So I asked if he could drum and he's going to come and drum with us.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.560
No, I want to come.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.560
That's amazing.

33:41.560 --> 33:42.560
You never know.

33:42.560 --> 33:46.600
Sometimes you wake up to a carpet of ants, sometimes one of them turns into a drummer.

33:46.600 --> 33:50.080
That's an amazing thing about our bodies.

33:50.080 --> 33:57.640
We just shoot out torpedoes that either we're talking about a carpet of ants because I talked

33:57.640 --> 33:58.640
about it on a scale.

33:58.640 --> 34:02.760
Yeah, I just said that you guys, I just heard you and Dan brought that up, but I just today

34:02.760 --> 34:06.400
was listening to you and Andy talking about how ants love to come.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.440
I did not know that they go nuts.

34:09.440 --> 34:10.640
They like they'll visit.

34:10.640 --> 34:15.080
Let me do an imitation of an aunt just coming upon come like again, here's what you want

34:15.080 --> 34:20.040
to, here's what you want to spend $5 to subscribe to Harmontown so you can see.

34:20.040 --> 34:22.480
The visuals of what Dino's about to do.

34:22.480 --> 34:24.480
This is a normal aunt.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.480
Let's just say you're come.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.480
Okay.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.480
He's going about his business.

34:28.480 --> 34:29.480
Oh, shit!

34:29.480 --> 34:30.480
Oh, where are the guys?

34:30.480 --> 34:31.480
Where's everyone?

34:31.480 --> 34:32.480
Which way do I go?

34:32.480 --> 34:33.480
Which way do I go?

34:33.480 --> 34:40.720
They literally go nuts when they taste the come.

34:40.720 --> 34:41.720
It's awful.

34:41.720 --> 34:50.000
Do you think it's maybe, here's a theory, maybe it's because ants, ants are so sophisticated

34:50.000 --> 34:58.280
as carnivores that they can taste DNA and they, and they, and they're tasting the sophistication

34:58.280 --> 35:03.600
of a primate, which is like they don't even, their brain can't process it.

35:03.600 --> 35:08.560
Their aunt tongues are like, this is beyond grilled octopus.

35:08.560 --> 35:09.560
I don't think so.

35:09.560 --> 35:13.240
I think it's, I think it's I drink pineapple juice and it tastes great.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.360
Oh, he loves pineapple juice.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.360
That's the camera.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.360
Ants love pineapples.

35:18.360 --> 35:19.360
They do.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.360
All right.

35:20.360 --> 35:25.040
Well, we only have one extra chair, Dino, so you, you, I understand you brought 17 people

35:25.040 --> 35:26.040
from your show.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.200
They don't, they can't even sit here.

35:27.200 --> 35:30.440
I got my, my drawing room back.

35:30.440 --> 35:33.120
I want to, I want to help you.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.760
You guys are both from Chicago.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.240
We should talk a little for a second.

35:36.240 --> 35:38.600
I'm from Milwaukee, which is much colder.

35:38.600 --> 35:39.600
And shittier.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.600
Yeah.

35:40.600 --> 35:41.600
In general.

35:41.600 --> 35:42.600
Fireworks.

35:42.600 --> 35:48.640
But, you know, why so many, I think a lot of everyone in Los Angeles that works in television

35:48.640 --> 35:50.200
is, is, is from Chicago.

35:50.200 --> 35:53.360
I wonder is what, what, what, what that is.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.360
Second city.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.360
Well, funny.

35:55.360 --> 35:56.360
You should ask.

35:56.360 --> 35:57.360
Uh, I have no idea.

35:57.360 --> 36:03.240
No, I, uh, I was thinking about that too because I, I grew up and I wanted to do nothing

36:03.240 --> 36:05.160
else but comedy.

36:05.160 --> 36:08.400
And I think it was just coincidence that Chicago was a comedy based city.

36:08.400 --> 36:13.760
I think, you know, I'm just a goofy, ugly guy who got picked on a lot.

36:13.760 --> 36:15.440
So of course I wanted to get a new comedy.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.440
You're beautiful.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.440
Oh my God.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.440
Come on.

36:18.440 --> 36:19.440
Yeah.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.440
Well, that's where I know you from.

36:20.440 --> 36:21.440
You're, you're down here.

36:21.440 --> 36:26.440
Thanks for letting me audition for that sketch.

36:26.440 --> 36:29.080
I never fucking read it.

36:29.080 --> 36:33.480
You sucked me off and I didn't even read your sketch.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.640
When did you, you guys were, you're talking about Conan.

36:35.640 --> 36:36.640
Yeah.

36:36.640 --> 36:37.640
He was your intern.

36:37.640 --> 36:38.640
I was an intern.

36:38.640 --> 36:39.640
Yeah.

36:39.640 --> 36:44.080
The first summer on the air, I was the general office intern.

36:44.080 --> 36:50.680
So this guy, Smigal, Louie, Louie with the trumpet and the gum thrown against the wall.

36:50.680 --> 36:51.680
And I couldn't believe it.

36:51.680 --> 36:52.680
I couldn't believe it.

36:52.680 --> 36:53.680
He had a trumpet.

36:53.680 --> 36:54.680
I don't remember that.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.680
He was walking around the trumpet and he never played it.

36:56.680 --> 36:59.240
He, I don't think, I know he didn't play the trumpet.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.240
He had one.

37:00.240 --> 37:01.240
So he was like, hadn't he?

37:01.240 --> 37:05.200
One day he, he spit his gum and he threw a trumpet and it just stuck to the wall.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.200
Something like that.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.000
Were you there when we had the kitten running around too?

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
I don't remember the kitten.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.720
There was a kitten called, we were going to call this show night night with Conan O'Brien,

37:12.720 --> 37:15.920
but they wouldn't let us at NBC.

37:15.920 --> 37:19.400
So we named a kitten night night and it just wandered around everywhere.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.920
And everyone loved this kitten.

37:20.920 --> 37:24.680
And then Max Weinberg came and he was like, I'm allergic to kittens and we had to get

37:24.680 --> 37:25.680
rid of it.

37:25.680 --> 37:26.680
What a dick.

37:26.680 --> 37:27.680
He's a dick.

37:27.680 --> 37:28.680
Right?

37:28.680 --> 37:29.680
He was a dick.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.680
He literally was a dick.

37:30.680 --> 37:31.680
I didn't like him.

37:31.680 --> 37:34.080
I had, he threatened to beat me up a few times.

37:34.080 --> 37:38.000
It's that Bruce, it's that East Street band, Moxie, you know?

37:38.000 --> 37:41.240
Yeah, except Bruce had talent.

37:41.240 --> 37:45.560
I heard, I heard that he couldn't even keep a beat.

37:45.560 --> 37:46.560
Like keep time.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.120
Let's get a Twitter war going tonight.

37:48.120 --> 37:51.800
I think, I will say with Chicago, I mean, I can only speak about my experience, but

37:51.800 --> 37:57.200
like between getting exposed to all the movies filming there, my bodyguard, the John Hughes

37:57.200 --> 38:02.600
stuff, and having Second City that you go to, it occurred to me that comedy was something

38:02.600 --> 38:04.920
you could do as a job.

38:04.920 --> 38:07.480
And it wasn't just something that happened far away.

38:07.480 --> 38:10.200
I think that for me was part of it.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.720
Yeah, because you're a good looking guy.

38:11.720 --> 38:12.720
I'll take it.

38:12.720 --> 38:13.720
I'll take it.

38:13.720 --> 38:14.720
But we don't have anything to compare.

38:14.720 --> 38:15.720
You scratched my back.

38:15.720 --> 38:16.720
I'll scratch yours, my friend.

38:16.720 --> 38:20.200
Because I mean, I grew up in Milwaukee, which is like a smaller, I'm going to offend my

38:20.200 --> 38:22.080
Milwaukee brethren.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.760
It's a smaller Chicago.

38:23.760 --> 38:29.640
It also had its own little smaller comedy community, you know, like, so I have to wonder

38:29.640 --> 38:34.400
like, okay, maybe if you grew up in a town of 200 people, I guess maybe you didn't grow

38:34.400 --> 38:38.400
up around comedy clubs and, I don't know.

38:38.400 --> 38:43.560
Like, I mean, I, I don't know what my point is, like, what am I trying to scientifically

38:43.560 --> 38:47.680
prove there's something in the water in Chicago that makes them move to L.A.?

38:47.680 --> 38:48.680
I'm not sure.

38:48.680 --> 38:54.240
I do think Second City, a lot of people came out of Second City as like a breeding ground

38:54.240 --> 38:59.280
and I don't know why it might be like maybe people in Chicago are like, well, I got to

38:59.280 --> 39:05.080
move to one of two bigger cities and I don't want to move to the fucking dirty one.

39:05.080 --> 39:06.080
And I'm sick of the cold.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.080
Right.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.080
I'm sick of the cold.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.560
I look like a fucking more complicated one.

39:10.560 --> 39:11.560
Right.

39:11.560 --> 39:12.560
Yeah.

39:12.560 --> 39:13.560
That's probably what it is.

39:13.560 --> 39:14.560
It's like, yeah, forget it, brother.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.560
Okay.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.320
But Scott Atson is also from Chicago?

39:17.320 --> 39:18.320
Right.

39:18.320 --> 39:21.320
Is that, is that a good sign?

39:21.320 --> 39:23.480
Scott Atson, everybody!

39:23.480 --> 39:25.580
Scott Atson!

39:25.580 --> 39:27.920
Who's also from Chicago?

39:27.920 --> 39:29.060
Scott Atson!

39:29.060 --> 39:31.400
That guy is famous.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.420
Scott Atson!

39:33.420 --> 39:34.920
I seen that guy on TV.

39:34.920 --> 39:36.160
Also from Chicago.

39:36.160 --> 39:37.160
Hi.

39:37.160 --> 39:42.260
No, no, please just you're an you're an aunt to my come

39:43.880 --> 39:45.880
Help yourself I

39:46.680 --> 39:49.440
Was gonna make a baby with this one day, but I'll make more

39:51.240 --> 39:53.240
There's a lot of fat ants out there because

39:59.920 --> 40:01.920
They can't get back into the

40:01.920 --> 40:07.640
And that guy jerks off a lot

40:09.400 --> 40:11.400
Hi, Scott. Hi

40:11.680 --> 40:14.920
Dino brought you out to talk about he had

40:15.840 --> 40:17.840
Yeah, sorry. Well, no, no, no

40:18.240 --> 40:22.000
Chicago when I moved to New York because I'm more complicated than these people

40:23.120 --> 40:25.120
Didn't you move to LA first though?

40:25.120 --> 40:35.400
Do you know do you know you moved to New York as well for a time and then you move from New York to LA on

40:36.600 --> 40:43.240
912 yes, yeah, no first I moved LA and then then I went to New York all the travel they bro. Yeah

40:44.880 --> 40:51.300
Yeah, no, I we saw this this is a funny story. We saw the second plane hit out our window

40:51.300 --> 40:53.300
Uh

40:54.140 --> 41:01.380
Luckily, it wasn't a plane window. We were we were actually in our house and I was like check, please New York

41:02.220 --> 41:04.220
And I was like all three stooches

41:06.820 --> 41:13.640
I just love that concept because I it tickles me so much because the the flowchart your brain goes through is like

41:13.640 --> 41:20.660
Oh, you're not you're not supposed to have that reaction because that's cowardly like your job is to stand there and get out of

41:20.660 --> 41:22.260
sword

41:22.260 --> 41:24.020
Bring another one

41:24.020 --> 41:28.860
well, you know people did help drag out bodies and stuff, but you know

41:29.460 --> 41:32.420
Sorry everyone, but I had a daughter, you know

41:32.420 --> 41:38.660
She was like two years old and we're really close and we're living there and and like the fumes of

41:40.260 --> 41:42.060
Everything was coming in people are getting sick

41:42.060 --> 41:48.020
So by the way, I talked to a kid in New York who works for a law firm who you know under the Obama administration

41:48.020 --> 41:53.820
There was attention paid to this because it otherwise, you know, wouldn't have been not to not to

41:54.260 --> 41:58.380
Suck a previous administration stick too hard, but doesn't take that much these days

42:00.260 --> 42:07.140
Probably people people in Arkansas that are Obama lovers right now, but the the the the

42:07.780 --> 42:13.300
There was a you know, he his administration said, you know, come on. There's there's been

42:13.300 --> 42:20.180
You got fucked up if you were lived near ground zero like it's bestest and all this shit. Anyways, I don't know

42:20.180 --> 42:25.940
Yeah, I got out of there and also I had you know, I have this amazing little, you know carrot dangling called

42:26.340 --> 42:28.340
writing for master of disguise

42:30.260 --> 42:34.260
Now master of disguise was I knew you were gonna grab onto this

42:34.260 --> 42:41.180
Uh Dana Carvey movie about a guy who these kids grew up on that movie. So, you know that movie?

42:42.980 --> 42:51.020
There's probably you know, you know was brought in to save it. Yeah, I rewrote I rewrote 90% of it and

42:51.980 --> 42:53.980
then

42:54.340 --> 43:00.540
Adam Sandler came in and took my 90% out and threw it away and put in fart jokes and bush jokes and everything I

43:01.540 --> 43:03.260
I I

43:03.260 --> 43:09.020
Wish I could show you my cut because I I don't have it and so you're never gonna believe me that I

43:10.660 --> 43:12.660
It was better

43:13.140 --> 43:16.180
The idea that there's a fucking masterpiece

43:17.180 --> 43:19.180
version of master of disguise

43:19.540 --> 43:21.540
It's not outside the relevant

43:21.940 --> 43:27.900
Wasn't a masterpiece, but god damn it. It was kind of fun. They shot your version. Yeah, they shot it

43:27.900 --> 43:34.860
Re-editing re-editing disaster. Yeah, yeah, he had a friends and family screening and they said we're not gonna take any notes from them

43:34.860 --> 43:36.860
We're just you know, it's just the friends and family

43:38.340 --> 43:43.180
Every note they took every note brutal. Yeah more farts was the main joke more farts

43:43.460 --> 43:48.420
One one joke and I'm probably gonna bury myself because you're probably gonna go that sounds bad

43:48.700 --> 43:55.420
but if you remember halfway like he has a little puppy called the cuteness which wasn't out my

43:55.420 --> 43:58.340
idea, let's a little puppy because the

43:59.540 --> 44:00.820
I

44:00.820 --> 44:07.620
Forget who like with Sony said we need a little puppy in this you yeah, so it showed up and

44:08.060 --> 44:14.940
Halfway through the movie it just got lost and then the grandfather came in that and he was the master of disguise, right?

44:14.940 --> 44:21.700
Sounds bad. Yeah. Yeah, so I didn't write any of that and then halfway through the the grandfather comes in

44:21.700 --> 44:25.260
He's supposed to be a master of disguise and the puppies never talked about again

44:25.260 --> 44:30.820
So my idea was that the grandfather was there the whole time. He was in the little puppy costume

44:31.580 --> 44:37.900
And then he came out and then at the end they're like we missed the cuteness. He's like, oh, I hate dog food

44:37.900 --> 44:40.780
All right, and he has to go back and be a puppy for the rest of his life

44:41.020 --> 44:43.620
You know puppy awesome and the big note was

44:44.180 --> 44:48.700
Like parents were going don't kill the puppy at the end. It's like you're not we're not killing a puppy

44:48.700 --> 44:53.260
We're bringing it back to life. I mean, yeah, didn't make any sense whatsoever fucking hate Adam Sandler

44:54.100 --> 44:58.100
Ben Stiller Adam Sandler Max Weinberg. They can all fuck themselves

45:01.100 --> 45:06.980
The big moment it's a big moment someone's gonna catch I hate those guys. I hate those guys

45:06.980 --> 45:12.180
They ruin my life. What do you hate? Look at me? What are you two thousand books, and I'm not gonna sell I

45:12.180 --> 45:18.060
Mean so the views of Dino don't reflect some of the bridges that I haven't burned yet

45:19.260 --> 45:24.180
I think there's like two or three or those that I I prefer to burn my own

45:24.780 --> 45:29.460
I'm almost there, but I soon I will have a box of two thousand books

45:30.500 --> 45:32.500
And I'll be happy that way

45:32.580 --> 45:36.740
And you should be happy too because you're a joyful life master that everyone looks up to

45:36.740 --> 45:45.060
All right seven people agree you don't want to be this guy's intern

45:48.180 --> 45:51.660
What's it like Dino sitting next to an intern who has a better career than you

45:53.700 --> 45:55.700
All the interns who's

45:56.860 --> 46:02.100
Matt our intern on Mike our intern on sometimes live

46:02.100 --> 46:08.380
Matt became a big writer for cause be right right and and that

46:10.580 --> 46:17.260
Arden Arden Arden Arden Mirren was Arden Marine Marine Arden Marine party machine. Yeah, she was she's doing way better than me

46:18.060 --> 46:20.060
Conan he's doing great

46:20.300 --> 46:22.300
He was your intern

46:22.300 --> 46:28.940
No, I think he started wait no he was a yeah, I can't remember where did he come from?

46:28.940 --> 46:31.940
How did he get that show?

46:37.220 --> 46:42.700
Is Weinberg still doing anything is there a risk to burning that bridge he plays with Bruce Brink?

46:42.700 --> 46:47.460
I I burnt I burnt that bridge when I was on Conan. Yeah, and he you know, it's a little bridge

46:49.140 --> 46:51.140
And I think it was built on fire

46:51.140 --> 47:02.980
That guy's a dick, what's your beef with Weinberg?

47:04.340 --> 47:10.580
Well, he treated his band really badly and tell the story. All right, well tell the music story

47:10.580 --> 47:14.580
That's right. I forgot. I told it on skull juice, but you guys don't mind hearing it again

47:14.580 --> 47:18.580
Assholes

47:21.460 --> 47:23.460
But for Max Weinberg

47:24.260 --> 47:26.260
Ben Stiller

47:26.660 --> 47:33.340
What's the other guy Adam Sandler and this fucking audience could all go fuck themselves

47:33.740 --> 47:38.020
These guys are going places. I don't know. They're already more successful than me. I

47:38.860 --> 47:41.140
Had a beg to come on this show you guys are just here

47:42.140 --> 47:43.780
so

47:43.780 --> 47:50.220
One of like the Zappa brothers were on like this is back in 1992 93 and they wanted to come out

47:50.220 --> 47:52.740
I think I'm it wanted to come out and sing

47:53.460 --> 47:57.940
What's new pussycat and so Frank smiley who?

47:59.340 --> 48:02.940
Yeah, is he still there? Yeah, you could use your mic to sorry. Yeah

48:04.340 --> 48:08.020
He's the the audience. What do you call him?

48:08.020 --> 48:14.980
The audience guy. Yeah, no, not the audience guy the guest guy. He's the segment producer segment producer. Yeah

48:15.300 --> 48:18.500
Dude, I was an intern on the fucking show you wrote for you. Don't know

48:19.460 --> 48:24.100
I just wrote the ha ha's. Okay. Yeah, so so Frank smiley

48:24.740 --> 48:27.060
knocked on the band room door and

48:28.100 --> 48:32.220
And Max answered the whole band is there and for ink says hey

48:32.220 --> 48:38.060
Dweezel one or I'm it wants to do what's new pussycat and the band's like, oh, yeah, we love that son and and

48:38.620 --> 48:42.220
And Max stood up and he said oh wait wait wait wait wait hold on a second

48:42.220 --> 48:46.580
Hold on I said Frank come with me and he he goes outside shuts the door and he's yelling at Frank

48:46.580 --> 48:48.580
He's like, you know, I need

48:48.900 --> 48:52.540
48 hours notice we have to make them we have to write the notes out

48:52.540 --> 48:57.740
We have to do all this we have to and as he's screaming at him the band inside starts playing. What's new pussycat?

48:57.740 --> 49:04.780
And just Max just that's the greatest fuck you I've ever heard

49:06.300 --> 49:09.340
He's like, all right. All right. Well, I'll make it happen

49:09.980 --> 49:13.860
It probably wasn't even a fuck you though. It was just they were that excited and he was

49:14.420 --> 49:18.780
And he was moving that quickly to block. No, it's because he had no I they had no idea

49:18.780 --> 49:23.940
I was going out there to say we can't do that's because he gets money to write the charts for it

49:23.940 --> 49:29.860
Yeah, and they they got a lot of shit for it. We know I was like, no, I write it because I get paid for it

49:29.860 --> 49:32.220
Like no, we could do it right now. That's right

49:32.220 --> 49:37.640
He got paid and he didn't write anything Jimmy Vavino wrote all the the music, you know

49:38.580 --> 49:40.580
Max Whamberg has him killed

49:42.660 --> 49:48.300
Did I make that up well the band didn't like Max and like when shits like that happened Max would go off on them and they

49:48.300 --> 49:54.300
would and we would talk as I was friends with the band and they were like, he's such an asshole and and

49:54.500 --> 49:56.500
And they're like, please don't say anything

49:56.940 --> 49:58.940
on a podcast

49:59.300 --> 50:01.300
Well, he's not there anymore, but

50:02.020 --> 50:06.860
Because I think once I brought it up and it was even worse for them. So

50:07.580 --> 50:13.140
so I had this bit called to marry the ostrich where I got into an ostrich costume and

50:14.260 --> 50:16.060
Thank you

50:16.060 --> 50:18.060
you're my biggest fan and

50:19.100 --> 50:21.420
so I would come out every once in a while and

50:21.940 --> 50:29.220
just the whole bit was just like going out in this ostrich costume and hitting people with the head in the neck and and stuff and

50:30.820 --> 50:34.060
One time when the band was complaining. I said don't worry. I'll get max and

50:34.580 --> 50:37.380
I get it went out and they're you know, they're playing this song

50:37.380 --> 50:43.740
then and then and then and then the just dumb ostrich comes out and I take the head and I start bashing his drum set and

50:43.740 --> 50:46.780
knock and I knocked over a cymbals that broke them and

50:47.300 --> 50:50.780
shit and and then I did my bit and left and

50:51.820 --> 50:57.180
Enter it might have been you someone came up to me and said get the fuck out of here max is going to break your neck

50:57.940 --> 50:59.940
And I fucking ran home

51:00.300 --> 51:06.940
And he and he asked for my check that week for your check for the tomorrow the ostrich check, which is

51:09.060 --> 51:11.540
He's like he's not getting paid for that ostrich stint

51:11.540 --> 51:18.100
And he got my three hundred dollars. I would have never seen him chewing out you in an ostrich costume

51:19.740 --> 51:25.060
I've yelled at people with the ostrich legs and that just stomped away with the big feet

51:25.060 --> 51:29.820
I remember saying to the the head writer at the time. It wasn't smuggled with some other head writer

51:29.820 --> 51:32.680
I'm like you just settle for shit and I walk away in the

51:33.860 --> 51:35.860
flopping in the big feet

51:35.860 --> 51:42.000
Look like an idiot. I'm not a musician expert person, but but I think if you can break

51:42.380 --> 51:45.780
Symbols you should get that money back from the Guitar Center

51:46.660 --> 51:48.900
Like if there's symbols their job is to

51:49.660 --> 51:56.260
Crash yeah, that's what he said. They broke. I don't know yeah, come on max Weinberg. Yeah, hate him

51:56.340 --> 51:58.340
He probably voted for Trump. Oh

51:59.380 --> 52:02.060
I guarantee it if he thinks symbols can break

52:02.060 --> 52:09.620
Then he thinks democracy can be fucked with turns out it can't I thought so too. I'm embarrassed now I

52:10.340 --> 52:12.340
Found out my mom my mom my mom

52:12.340 --> 52:14.300
I don't know if my mom wants me to talk about it

52:14.300 --> 52:19.420
But I want to talk about how good it feels when you find out that somebody you were afraid to ask

52:20.020 --> 52:23.740
Who they voted for you know like turns out to you know my mom

52:23.740 --> 52:30.140
I don't know. I'm hard on my mom like like like myth mythologically like I call her a lizard woman and stuff

52:30.140 --> 52:31.420
I

52:31.420 --> 52:34.100
Lot I like your mom. She never raised me badly

52:34.100 --> 52:40.980
But when I got home from lax like when I accidentally protested by landing on top of the protest for an airplane or thing

52:41.380 --> 52:42.380
I

52:42.380 --> 52:47.660
And I kind of tweeted the play-by-play of it and I got home and she texted me and and

52:48.700 --> 52:52.140
She sent me a picture of her in a pink pussy hat and it was

52:53.140 --> 52:58.620
I was afraid to ask I thought I really thought I was very comfortable thinking I just assumed my Wisconsin parents

52:58.620 --> 53:05.380
You know that they voted for for Trump, and I really didn't want to know that yeah next Thanksgiving will be way less awkward for you

53:05.580 --> 53:10.740
Yeah, I mean I guess I don't really go there for Thanksgiving

53:11.540 --> 53:15.260
Guess I'm kind of maybe now. I'm officially the bad the bad family member

53:16.780 --> 53:20.060
What do you guys know you don't even know who Max Weinberg is?

53:21.460 --> 53:23.460
You and you ood like it was like

53:23.460 --> 53:27.860
It's a feud it's a few the mummies are fighting

53:29.900 --> 53:35.740
That's gonna those the bandage industry is never gonna be the same you don't care all you care about is hatred

53:35.740 --> 53:38.140
That's all you care about look where it got you

53:40.820 --> 53:42.820
Yeah

53:43.300 --> 53:46.860
All your all your policing of each other's language, you know

53:46.860 --> 53:54.100
That's just to just set up those fucking four-champ people to be like my feelings are hurt as a Nazi

53:54.100 --> 53:56.100
They're making fun of us now

53:56.700 --> 54:02.580
We got to just beat them up my gut my gun came today. Oh it did I didn't know you were telling everyone

54:02.580 --> 54:04.580
Yeah, well here we go

54:04.900 --> 54:08.700
As you know, I hope the nice thing about a gun is that you never have to

54:08.700 --> 54:16.260
I should just tell everyone I have a gun, right? That's true. It works. I know I'm not going over to your house anymore

54:16.700 --> 54:20.340
I'm gonna put a sign on to my house. I have a gun and I'm not sure I know how to use it

54:21.340 --> 54:23.100
I

54:23.100 --> 54:25.100
Might go off while I'm just waving it around

54:26.100 --> 54:32.380
So save me for last also don't don't beware the dog. They're very placid

54:33.780 --> 54:35.780
And they don't know how to use the gun either

54:35.780 --> 54:42.540
So Dan when you bought the gun when you said I'm gonna get a gun. What was the motivation? What did you picture using it for Trump?

54:44.180 --> 54:46.180
No, no, no, no, I

54:47.060 --> 54:52.660
Had to kill Trump that he was elected president and now you we should be you just don't want to be a sitting duck

54:52.660 --> 54:54.100
It's start. It's yes

54:54.100 --> 54:57.260
It's start it started with me being scared of general destabilization

54:57.620 --> 55:01.660
And then the first and then I saw I had Spencer start researching like well

55:01.660 --> 55:06.300
What do you do when you want to get one and Spencer did some research and it's like well one of the things

55:06.300 --> 55:09.420
I learned is 10-day waiting period. Okay for a handgun in LA

55:09.900 --> 55:10.900
and

55:10.900 --> 55:17.100
And then during the first 10 days of this administration so much shit happened that I was like, okay

55:17.100 --> 55:23.100
I'm not you know a 10-day waiting period is exactly the amount of time you want to I was just like

55:23.100 --> 55:25.540
I don't know why I will want this

55:25.540 --> 55:34.020
I have to assume I may need it that I will want it twice as much 10 days right right right the first 10 days was a doozy

55:35.540 --> 55:40.740
It looked very familiar to anyone who didn't fall asleep during 10th grade history class

55:41.220 --> 55:48.900
Like it looked real fucking familiar and and and I just I kind of sometimes I talked about with my therapist

55:48.900 --> 55:50.900
She asked me the same thing. What's it for?

55:50.900 --> 55:55.420
Is it for you as it for you know, it's like like

55:56.100 --> 55:58.420
Look, it's it's for

55:59.420 --> 56:09.140
Sometimes it's for the fact that like I think it's just a general state of like it's for the fact that all of my control over my

56:10.100 --> 56:18.860
My recourse to representation my recourse to sanity and stuff like that being taken away. It's like I'm this white privileged

56:18.860 --> 56:22.780
Dude, that's just like it's my first experience with it

56:22.780 --> 56:25.180
Those those nerve endings have never been stimulated

56:25.180 --> 56:31.020
So I just fucking wandered out and bought a power tool. That's like the same

56:31.020 --> 56:35.780
You know, it's like like no sometimes you might want to put a hole in another person at some point

56:35.860 --> 56:40.540
Like like it's like a black and decker commercial in your head. It's just like don't be caught off guard with

56:41.580 --> 56:45.320
It's just sort of like like sometimes in my head if the dust is attacking you

56:45.320 --> 56:48.240
So sometimes sometimes in my head

56:48.240 --> 56:55.480
It's just a general destabilization thing where it's like like like I want to have it in a locked case somewhere in my home

56:56.520 --> 56:58.520
so that if

56:58.600 --> 57:04.960
Because of all this domino effect of all the shit that's being caused by people who are rank amateurs in the White House who are

57:04.960 --> 57:09.320
just think executive orders are just like fucking office memos and and

57:09.320 --> 57:16.160
and and purposely causing destabilization and also out and out calling out to cities and

57:16.520 --> 57:23.040
States and saying I don't I don't recognize your sovereignty like like like all this talk going on

57:23.240 --> 57:30.040
Sometimes the thought in my head is like this is a this is as close as we're ever gonna get in our lifetime to a situation that could cause

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
plummets of

57:33.360 --> 57:37.000
infrastructure on a on a level that would make me

57:37.000 --> 57:44.760
responsible for the food and water of like a large group of people in my neighborhood and I and and so

57:44.960 --> 57:48.520
Maybe that guy should have a gun because for friendly reasons

57:49.160 --> 57:56.640
Because they won't listen to a whistle around my neck. I don't know like like I don't what maybe I'll maybe I end up in charge of

57:56.960 --> 57:58.960
19 kids, you know

57:58.960 --> 58:04.620
I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't want to wait until the moment. I'm like I

58:04.620 --> 58:09.500
I think I think it's the apocalypse and Dan Harmon never wanted to be a father

58:11.740 --> 58:13.740
That's it come ever

58:14.180 --> 58:20.620
And the funny thing about the end of the world is they did yeah, you just never there's never enough time

58:21.260 --> 58:26.660
To prepare for it and you just kind of go. Yeah, what's this? What are some of the tools? I'll need

58:26.660 --> 58:29.380
I mean, I'm also getting a water filter. I'm not

58:29.380 --> 58:35.940
Exclusive I'm not exclusively going. How will I kill people? I'm like how like I'm obsessed about all these details

58:35.940 --> 58:38.460
And one of them is like like I think or so

58:38.820 --> 58:42.020
Yeah, did you did you talk about going in and buying this yet?

58:42.020 --> 58:48.660
Cuz one of my favorite things that you said when you walked in is like it's they're so excited to see it's like a sushi restaurant

58:48.660 --> 58:50.660
It is

58:51.140 --> 58:54.860
When you actually start looking around for them in Burbank, it's like holy shit

58:54.860 --> 58:59.740
They're like I just I don't think this is it's very much of an exaggeration come out of hiding these places

58:59.740 --> 59:02.780
You did the street that we went on it had like nine

59:03.380 --> 59:09.260
It was like there were three on a block. Yeah, and they weren't that there's like are they competing with each other

59:09.260 --> 59:15.660
They had sandwich boards out front like a boutique restaurant like like nine millimeter ammo half off and stuff. Yeah

59:16.380 --> 59:18.380
Hey, I'm helping out

59:18.380 --> 59:23.740
Sorry, I like it when you talk. Thanks. Me too. No, they're very

59:25.380 --> 59:33.860
They're very excited about new gun owners at gun stores for obvious reasons old gun owners probably probably die

59:36.420 --> 59:44.380
They're like hey, it's like buying a motorcycle. Yeah, exactly. We're not we're not what's not catered to our base

59:44.380 --> 59:49.580
We need to swell our ranks. I don't know anything about guns

59:51.260 --> 59:53.260
Welcome to people boys in

59:54.940 --> 01:00:01.580
All right, yeah, but anyways my 10-day waiting period is up. So now I'll have a little I'll have a locked case in my home

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:06.180
Put a gun to their heads Lee and tell them to buy some Trent books

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:11.740
Buy some buy it by I like segues. Yeah, we got Britta back there

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:17.460
We could sing a song you want to do a selection from your from your comp from your graphic novel

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:23.220
Which is also a musical about it's the it's a world's first musical graphic novel

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.220
I haven't done a lot of research on that

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:30.260
But I'm pretty sure I mean I googled musical graphic novel and mine was the only one that came up

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.980
So maybe if I had

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:38.540
But there was musical and then graphic novel and then just me if ice if I step over here behind Spencer

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:45.500
You'll have this space to play your guitar. Oh, yeah, and then and then Britta could come out and sing a selection or without Scott

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:50.620
So, all right, let's rotate and bring up Britta. You can talk to her

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:05.380
Before she starts talking she was the voice the singing voice of gem in gem in the Argonauts hologram hologram

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:09.660
Oh, thank you. And and what else were you you were in your Luna?

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.060
Talk about yourself

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:21.620
I don't like to talk about myself, but I I like to show up wherever Dino says to come and she was the voice of

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:25.740
Blobberta on moral oral. Yes, and she was also

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:28.980
Elizabeth in Frankenhol Frankenhol

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.380
Dan took the mic oh

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.460
No, you should keep it. I know I can use Spencer's here

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.660
Okay. Yeah, Spencer never talks. I

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:44.300
Like it when you talk he picks his shots

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.100
So

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:50.660
Yeah, what were you saying? I just want you to point at me when it's my turn to sing

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.220
So anyway

01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:00.420
Yeah, if you guys know moral oral at all

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:05.980
Well, if you like third season of moral oral, which is what got me canceled and in trouble

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.420
You'll like Trent because it's really depressing

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:15.060
But it's uplifting a little bit too, right? I don't want to give away too much about it

01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:19.580
It's about hope and people are traditionally in the market for

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:27.220
Synicism and depression but even now in in today's political. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:33.460
It's the word. I know it's the worst time to bring a dark black novel out

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.540
You know, it's such a dark black time

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:42.420
It should sell really don't buy it don't buy it

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.420
It's not cheap either

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:50.100
Aren't you I looked at the price

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:57.500
Like really why should really selling it like if someone gives you $25 on this stage, won't you give them a book from that box?

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.500
You have it's not $25. It's

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:04.860
2499 and a penny. So you're saying it's something it's something nobody wants and it's

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:07.860
$15 and $16

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:09.540
Wait, what?

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.540
No, the ship is sailed

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:18.980
No, I will sell it for $20 here and and these guys will we you sign it to

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:24.180
Richie, I can't wait to sign. Yeah, you have you had nothing to do with it, but maybe you'll direct

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.900
It's 9-11. I

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:33.140
I actually made it because I want to make a stop motion movie of it and really bore everyone silly

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:38.780
So maybe you could direct it. I can't wait to read it. I want Scott in Britain to do the main voices

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:41.180
Well, we we can't wait to read it

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:48.080
Why don't you why don't you get out your guitar gonna get out my guitar you guys talk

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:51.100
All right. Well

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:53.140
So here's the thing

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:54.740

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:18.420
Yeah, yeah, there's fire code

01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:26.380

Have 40 boxes back there the old broken box trick look at it's a handsome book

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:09.900
Britt, did you want to read from the blurbs in the back of people who?

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:12.420
read it

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.460
Well with the mic in your face

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:20.100
Trent is trenchant funny disturbingly and unremittingly strange

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:28.100
How it results in something so touching is anyone's guess maybe it's the singing and who who said that?

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.500
Charlie Kaufman

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:32.660
Charlie Kaufman

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:40.700
Wait now breathe it better read the last one to breathe read the bottom. Oh, no. It's funnier if they okay

01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:43.220
Wendell they get worse as you

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:50.020
Go down the last one. No, no second one second one second time. Okay as

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.740
pessimistic as Trent is

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:56.900
It still ends up hopeful in its own sick way

01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:01.780
And who said that Andy Richter Andy Richter. Okay. All right next one

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:06.660
Now this guy you could tell didn't really like it this next year

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:14.260
The Dino wrote the greatest scenes on mr.. Show. Here is a book that digs deeper into his alternate in universe

01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:16.300
comic and

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:20.140
Unsettling it's a perfect dose of Stamatopoulos

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:25.180
Stamatopoulos. Oh, Stamatopoulos. Sorry who said that Bob Odin Kirk Bob Odin Kirk

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:28.940
You know I talked to him. He's like it wasn't for me

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.700
But you wanted his name on the book

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:39.420
But you know I said you could say anything and I'll print it so and then hit and then the next one halfway through

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:43.940
Bold original painfully real will finish tomorrow

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:49.420
He never he never finished it who never finished it Dana Carvey Dana Carvey

01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:58.620
Never finished it. He had a much better review, but Sandler changed it

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:06.180
You guys read what Dana Carvey didn't okay

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:18.180
All right next this is the last one. I'm not sure who this would appeal to who said that David Cross. Yeah, so

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.100
Bo the nightmare my life's a nightmare

01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:29.060
Both Bob Bob and Dave. Yeah, didn't like it. Yeah

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:34.860
Yeah, yep 25 dollars

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:42.060
$24.99, but I'm selling here for 20. All right, it's probably gonna go down

01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:45.940
This is the worst telethon ever

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.980
He can't even afford a real box to put it in

01:08:52.980 --> 01:09:01.100
You guys ever stay in a five-star hotel and you get room service and then the and then the guy comes in the room

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:06.300
And it's like Jesus Christ like he knows less about your order than you do

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:12.020
Like he's just he's in your bedroom functionally, and it's like you and your you're in your bed and you're in your underwear

01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:15.940
And he's going like oh, I got a quesadilla

01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:19.180
Like yeah, I know

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:23.340
And then a Diet Coke, why are you reviewing it?

01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:30.260
He doesn't and then it was like it holds up a croissant and goes like I think it's

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:34.020
It's a moonbread like

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:40.220
You're a stranger in my bedroom get out. I came here to get away from people

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:44.020
Get out of here. I want the food to come in a tube

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:51.620
What is your crazy person coming in here talking about I don't know what what about sitting down here makes you into Schrab

01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:57.540
See Spencer, that's what you gotta do just interrupt. Oh, yeah, so Rob's job is everybody Rob

01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:07.180
I bring him out here. He doesn't want to come out Rob Schrab

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.140
Don't stop on the books

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.100
We don't have enough people out here

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:21.100
Rob Schrab

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:29.260
I resent being told I was interrupting. I mean, are you gonna do your song? Yeah

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:33.060
Hello, Dan

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:35.540
Hey Rob

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:42.580
Um, can we hear the guitar?

01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:51.780
Yeah, yeah, you're the best at listening to guitars. Yeah, you hear it

01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.740
Is it you hear it? I hear it. I hear it

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.420
Check one two check check one two

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:09.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we didn't plan this out anyway, this is a song that comes in like

01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:15.260
Beginning of the third act so you won't know what it's about, but it's kind of a pretty song

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:21.180
But something has happened to their family. How many acts are in this three acts, you know

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:33.380
I was asked about the sound department. Do you have volume control on your guitar? And if so, can you turn it up a bit?

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:36.300
It's all up. Let's do that

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:38.700
How's that?

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:44.700
Is there something wrong with it? It's a new guitar. They just they just wanted it louder for the for the audio, right? I know I

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:52.140
Say turn up a little bit more. Well, no, it can't go up. Okay, but it's a pretty song

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:56.300
Should we all come back later? I

01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:05.140
Thought you made fun of him not me. I like you Dino's book is now $17 everybody

01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:10.900
$17 thank God if it gets any cheaper we're gonna have to print 2,000 more

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:19.420
The nice thing is that you can you've got all the broken box, but you got all these books you can build a new box out of

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:26.780
You can take the returns home in that I really hate my life

01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:38.620
You want to tell them you want to set up the song at all do you want to do I need to yeah, you think you should

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:42.060
I don't know. I don't want to spoiler alert it for everyone who's not gonna buy it

01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:46.740
But I don't know if the song will resonate like you want it to if they don't know what's going on

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:49.500
Yeah, let's really get to the bottom of this

01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:53.660
Let's really stick their thing this through. Yeah

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:57.900
You're not gonna help you just want to you're just gonna yell at us

01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:08.660
Okay, it's not it's not a spoiler to say it's about pregnancy, right? It's about pregnancy something happens to their baby. It

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:11.100
lives

01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:16.580
On what page every two things babies do

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:21.020
One of them is they they grow up to be people

01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:28.940
There's a lot of things that could go wrong with a baby. Oh, that reminds me of a story

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:31.180
You know that story about my friend

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:37.620
I was watching a movie outlawed Jesse Wales with my friend and my brother was there and he had seen it and at one point

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:39.380
My friend asked my brother

01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:44.060
Does this character die and I'm like don't whisper it to him. I don't want to know

01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:50.140
So my brother whispers if he died or not and then we start watching some more and my friend turns to him and says when?

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:54.900
When does he keep living?

01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:00.100
That's story so funny. I've already told it when you weren't here

01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:06.860
I've actually already told it's not got a big one. No. Yeah, they don't care

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:11.700
Okay, so

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:17.620
It's a pretty song. I'm probably gonna screw it up. What what do you want? What?

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:21.260
You sing everything I gave you

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.540
Okay, I'm so mad at you right now

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:43.220
Yes, you used to shout

01:14:43.220 --> 01:15:01.060
You used to shout and now you're so quiet instead you failed and that takes away

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:04.180
All your squeal

01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:07.140
It's really not the end trend

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:10.180
But don't deny it

01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:15.820
Although you're feeling nothing still I know how you feel

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:19.100

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:54.540

01:15:55.540 --> 01:16:00.540
One for the master and one for the day

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:08.540

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:10.540

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.540
All right

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:22.940

01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:32.060
So that song's inside the comic book. Well, here's the thing Spencer. Thank you

01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:22.980
Know it's about that baby, but it's also not as funny as you think it is

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:29.140
It's not shock humor

01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:33.460

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:35.660

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:43.300
Articulate thing about why Trump shouldn't be the president because it undermines everything because the kid has just been coached

01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:48.380

01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:32.140
Should be in a basketball team

01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:38.060
Like you haven't achieved anything and you know it I should get a new bike I

01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:45.140
Should get an iPhone I should get more room for my toys

01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:48.380
I should get a dog

01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:53.740
You're just staring out the window

01:28:55.660 --> 01:29:03.420
Okay, this one I don't understand I'll clear it up more people should be on DJ Lou

01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:10.340
I've been saying this for years sounds sounds like something it sounds like a

01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:15.620
A radio station that's somebody it could be the word league without the e on the end

01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:20.620
No more people should be on DJ league if this school has a DJ league. I'm gonna kill myself. I

01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:23.260
Was on their side a minute ago

01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:27.540
Criminals should be caught on videotape

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:39.540
The problem is all the innocent people I caught on videotape my my child

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:45.860
But if you're saying I witness accounts are unreliable and police should have bodycams. Maybe we're sorry

01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:47.860
Maybe that's what they overheard their parents saying

01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:51.860
Okay, all right third-grade children. Yeah

01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:59.580
Yeah, how old are you third-grade you nine nine years old where where where where these kids now

01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:03.660
There were there they're bring him on

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:10.940
Bring them up. They're sleeping. They're sleeping. They're surrounded by kittens and dogs and snorkeling all over and iPods

01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:15.980
Oh, oh shit. I'm sorry. This is the end it looked like these were two different things

01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:21.820
No, the full thing is criminals should be caught on videotape because I witness cannot be trusted

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:28.340
And that little boy grew up to be big brother, right?

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:34.860
Yeah, or I mean, I know how is that when he was a little brother. How is I spelled?

01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:41.820
I witness. Yeah, how is it? Is it I or is it? No, it's building the okay spelled like this

01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:44.140
I witness

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:49.260
No, no, no, you just didn't know how to spell that row witness. What's that? You just didn't know how to spell no

01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:51.660
Why do you think I came here tonight?

01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:54.460
I should get a pet

01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:57.060
how

01:30:57.700 --> 01:31:00.380
Kid kid kids already burning up that dog topic

01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:03.300
You should stop littering

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.500
old judgy

01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:10.700
Dance is the best

01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:16.140
Dance is the best you got to dance it out and should be caught on videotape

01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:24.460
Basketball is the world's best sport and hockey is the best sport. I assume that last kid will beat up the kid above him and

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:27.820
All right. Yeah, those were third grade essay topics

01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:33.420
That's kind of a desk piece. Yeah, I want to get those essays though

01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:38.180
I want to see what they became. How did you how did you get a hold of those?

01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:44.060
I am friends with a person who I'm working with that is they their kid is in this third grade class and their teachers

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:49.620
I'm hearing a lot of fun stories. I the other teachers whenever we have one fun story

01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:53.980
Whenever we just name it. Just name it. What is the title?

01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:59.980
What are the titles for this fun story? If you're a teacher and you are a fan of the show

01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:04.260
Is this the title? I'd love you to come on the show. I always begging these people like I beg this

01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:08.600
person this teacher because she wrote she's written some stuff like

01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:15.500
She sends out an email to the parents and like the stuff that she says about teaching name one thing

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:19.980
She says I don't know if you're not gonna name a story. I don't have it

01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:23.940
I don't have my word for it that she's an admirable person. Are there any teachers in the audience?

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:28.500
We can't see you so say something. Well, we don't want to it'll be some guy going

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:34.340
I lied buy my fucking sponge that I make very wash in your car. It might be Dino, but

01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:38.420
It'll be a sponge that keeps you from slitting your wrists. It'll be I can't kick them off stage

01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:44.780
Remember when Dino came out with a box full of books and pretended the box broke so all the books spilled out across the floor

01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:47.940
And tried to elicit our pity so we would buy his book

01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:56.100
In entertainment news, did you guys know that this this guy? It's not 17 dollars. Taika Waititi. He signed on to direct

01:32:56.100 --> 01:33:05.420
This crazy stop-motion movie about Michael Jackson's chimp like I read that movie talk about career suicide. Am I right?

01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:11.780
But we wish him the best of luck with his new feature project bubbles

01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:16.500
Produced by star brands industry. It's my studio. It's why I brought it up. I know

01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:23.700
All right, anyway, lashed out at me. You're making that movie claws. I read that script. It's amazing. Yeah, it is

01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:26.380
Oh, it's so good. It really is. Yeah

01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:29.380
Now that hopefully it's better set up

01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:34.820
We should it will have the writer on in coming months. Maybe and we'll have the director on well

01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:36.820
We'll have the monkey on maybe

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.500
They'll rip off your face

01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:44.500
Those things will rip your face off. Yeah and testicles

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:48.220
So don't

01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:54.860
Don't mess with speaking Rob. What animals you do encounter in the wild in its own natural environment

01:33:54.860 --> 01:34:01.060
Would you be would you be most terrified to encounter like which one? Well, yeah, which which particular species of animal man?

01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:12.660
I was seriously a chimpanzee right because it's like a

01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:18.900
A human will shoot you or blow you up a lion will just fucking eat you and eviscerate you

01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:23.960
But these what we know of chimps is that they will they'll dress up like cowboys and then they'll rip your face off

01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:29.340
Yeah, they'll write a tricycle on the show and then you'll be like, hey, can I have the tricycle back on them?

01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:31.780
I'm like, I'm not sure I went through puberty an hour ago. So

01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:36.940
Peel now, it's my face

01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:45.380
Yeah, but uh, I mean rip your jaw around like a ceiling fan because my little tiny monkey arms are stronger than

01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:49.820
Yes, a fucking tank Spencer. Who do you say right off your finger? What Spencer?

01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:53.820
What what do you animal would you say is the most formidable if you had to encounter them?

01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:56.140
Which would be more terrifying for you. Yeah, man

01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:58.700
Man, they got guns

01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:02.740
You'd rather go one-on-one with a man than like a leopard. Yeah. Yeah

01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:08.260
Really? Yeah, I would rather go one-on-one with a man

01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:15.100
Than a left no like you hanging out like just going out like going out on a top buying shoes and

01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:23.960
Any any we know shopping probably better with a man the leopard. No, you said man was the most dangerous. Yeah. Yeah, I'm saying

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:31.320
You know, he means cheetah. He's he means multiple questions flying around

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:38.280
Yeah, no, no one has been clear in what the question is the question wasn't what are you more scared of the question was like

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:45.320
Like what are you asking? What would be the the last animal you'd want to go one-on-one with like the one that you would be most afraid

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.280
Yeah, hippos don't stop a hippo hippo

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:54.240
I feel more than than sharks. Yeah, I feel like if I don't know

01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:57.760
I mean if a lion's like I'm gonna kill this guy. He's probably gonna kill you

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:02.200
But like if a lion's like I might kill this guy and you stab him in the eye or something

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:07.520
He might fuck off. You never know but like a hippo. Oh, man. You're dead. You're fucking dead. I

01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.600
Hear terrible things about geese

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:17.040
Well, what are your sources

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:22.680
Uh anyone who's ever been golfing tells me that that who's someone's took their face off

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:28.600
They they don't got strong jaws. Let me tell you that they will bite you till the cows come home

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.600
But it won't hurt that bad

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:34.680
Spencer you've been bitten by a geese. Yeah, and you have cows by a geese

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.120
Yeah

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.120
They come they saved the day

01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:47.480
I was fucked. Have you been bitten by a goose? Yeah. Yeah, I mean I used to go to like duckpongs and stuff and feed animals

01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:52.400
And yeah geese are the super aggressive. They got weird weird. Yeah, they bit you. Yeah

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:58.480
Well, tell us tell us a tell us a where a classic goose bite. What part of your body did they bite you?

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
And describe it slowly

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000
The hands

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:13.680
They bit me on the hands I know because you had duck food and yeah, so you yeah

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:20.280
One time me and my friends were hanging out behind a Costco and we found that they threw out

01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:25.680
More than 40 fresh loaves of bread because they got the new bread in but they weren't bad breads

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:30.680
Presumably so we got 40 loaves of bread and went to the duck pond

01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:36.280
It was good, I think you guys were probably stoned we

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:44.240
No, we were definitely stoned, but that's not this time. We were making it rain. We were like slices and slices

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:50.600
Just flood in the water. It's probably bad for the local environment

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:56.920
But uh, no, you know, they're they were all loving I used to feed ducks and animals a lot like a duck pond in

01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:58.480
Simi Valley, there wasn't a lot to do

01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:03.080
There was a big duck pond that you could go to all sorts of animals and so sometimes you'd feed them

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:08.440
But yeah, the geese are the most aggressive so they'd come and they'd kind of swarm you and they really get like

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.840
They put their necks up like they're like trying to like square up with you to get food from you

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:17.440
Yeah, like they're they know you have food and they're trying to bully you. That's great

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:23.680
And that seems like so territorial to them. Yeah, they're and they're stupid like they're just really angry and dumb

01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:27.800
Like it's a really loathsome animal trait like like like like there's you know

01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:32.320
There's animals I understand animals coming at you and maybe scaring you because they want the food

01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:39.440
But like an animal that's like like being mean to you because it wants your food. What a dick. Yeah, they're not they're not nice

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:45.080
I geese are geese are lame, man. Wow. Yeah, they'll probably to bring it down, bro

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:48.720
Yeah, so thank you. I wonder if swans are like that

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:54.640
I mean, isn't a swan just like a just like a like a fancy goose. I think yeah, I don't know man

01:38:54.640 --> 01:39:01.160
What about those swans man the swan check out the swan every swan ever try to get your bread man

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:08.840
No, no, no, but these swans. I feel like they don't get close to the swans. No, I don't know

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:16.520
What do you guys think about like, you know how in hotels like? You

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:22.680
No matter how much or how little snacks are

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:31.840
Available the Snickers bar is like the Gideon Bible of the hotel snack always there. So I wonder is that like a corporate?

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:34.600
Toe completely unrelated

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:40.280
That's got to be based on demand though, right? That's got to be some no, that's got to be demand

01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:45.400
That's like the generic candy bar. I bet if you pulled candy bar Snickers is number one

01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:50.520
Yeah, it's the one that you can count on not like a bunch of like snokers and snookers

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:56.580
Like like like these ripoffs like how much how like wait wait like how come there's not like there's there's not really a lot of

01:39:56.580 --> 01:40:00.620
Candy bars that are very close to Snickers. I wonder if there's a fuck with that Mars candy bar

01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:07.120
Appropriation squatting like like yeah, like they just like if you try to add a certain amount of nougat to something they go like

01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:12.820
We invented that and you're like I can't have nougat and they're like you can't have nougat I

01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:18.900
Think they invented nougat. So yeah, I think I think nougat's kind of a gray area, too

01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:21.820
What what what actually can look comprises nobody knows

01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:24.380
Delicious, and that's all we know

01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:27.980
Talking about nougat you eat it and then you get a new gut

01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:31.340
Oh, no, that's great. That's a great job

01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:35.020
Yeah

01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:38.860
If you're talking to a child genius books are back down to $13

01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:49.940
All right, but they're back to $15. All right, well, here we go. I talked about pee

01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:52.980
And come

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:59.940
Come but Snickers are really satisfying the fucking best. Oh, man. They're a meal. I ate one on the way here

01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:04.100
I'm gonna have a little hey Dan remember when you and I had a deep-fried Mars bar in Scotland

01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:09.120
That was fucking good. Yeah, I don't I don't do the myth of the deep-fried

01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:14.700
Common-day items. I'm gonna put a little dent in that if I could they don't exist

01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:24.060
Well, I'm gonna have a deep-fried. It's a myth. I'm gonna have a deep-fried. Whatever. I'm gonna it comes at a deep-fried peanut butter cup

01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:27.100
It's a it's a ball of fried

Bread or whatever the fuck they this it and you open it and it's just like it's just goop like come on

01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:38.740
It's let's get real about what we're doing. I see the call you enjoying your deep-fried Mars bar when we were really drunk and well

01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:46.780
Sure, yeah, it's delicious. Okay. Yeah, I'm not gonna eat that. So I won't eat that forensic files. It's goop in the middle

01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:49.980
I'm not eating this

01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:52.860
Excuse me miss. Will you please take this back?

01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:58.460
No, I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna throw it in the garbage. It's a bunch of hot chocolatey mess

01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:01.540
But it's not like it is not to my satisfaction

01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:08.220
Hey, it's melted on the inside. Well, we put it in boiling oil, sir

01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:11.340
Why did you do that?

01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:15.580
Why did you do that?

01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:22.460
Five dollars get to the video subscription

01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:32.860
So, you know at the you watch forensic files, you know, they always have to close the episode because it's always sad

01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:38.140
Someone got murdered, you know, and so they can't end it with just the people because they can't go like yay

01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:43.500
We solved the forensics like like go like like hurray. I was stuck in the closet. I

01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:50.260
Was stuck in the closet. We thought you were murdered. No, I was stuck in the closet

01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:54.580
I'm so hot in there and I've been eating a coat. I'm so

01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:59.180
So they're stuck in the class that would have been a good episode. They don't do that

01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:01.180
But they never do that because they should do that

01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:07.340
They should do it once the the the second to last thing that happens is always the

01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:10.180
Stuck in the closet

01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:15.580
The murdered people's families they have to say like oh, we're so sad they got murdered and we always hang out

01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:18.660
They're grave and we always like miss them and stuff and it sucks that they're dead

01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:24.460
And but you can't end the episode like that. So then they always need this like I don't know how come they have just figured it out

01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:26.300
I don't get people to say it

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:31.500
But it's I guess because it's hard for these cops and stuff because it always has to be like a cop that says it

01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:35.340
They're not, you know, look if you're a cop and you're listening and you're a genius like

01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:39.500
email me, but but like like I don't like like I

01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:45.940
You know like I'm just saying there's been there's been court cases about the fact that they screen you for a high IQ and

01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:51.260
And and and not in the positive side like they're like because you tend to quit and waste taxpayers money

01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:56.700
But but so these cops are kind of like, you know, and they live and then so then they are like they you want to close

01:43:56.700 --> 01:44:01.780
The episode with them saying they just need to say that forensics like we're important

01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:05.660
And so they're always like they just like the music is rising up

01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:11.420
And it's like sometimes it takes them a really long time like they're going like this this was a case that

01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:17.540
Where a person definitely did a bad thing and it's not done as much

01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:22.420
But if it weren't if it weren't for for it for it for for science

01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:29.620
You could just you just like sense the it's kind of funny. It's just like a thing. I wanted to talk about I

01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:33.060
Just I watch every episode forensic files

01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:37.540
I'm always like waiting for that part at the end where somebody's just like like you they're almost getting played off

01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:42.820
You hear like the theme music coming up and they're just like like the this is a guy. Who's a bad guy?

01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:46.340
Say science. Yeah, exactly. They're like wait

01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:51.700
I just want him to say say like no at the you and you can tell that the way they start their quotes

01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:58.100
Like you could tell the interviewers are asking them like so do you think forensic science was crucial to this investigation?

01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:01.020
And they go yes, they go what could you?

01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:09.180
Can you put can you make the question part of the answer and so they go like I definitely think forensic science was important

01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:11.500
Because when you have when you have a crime

01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:19.540
You and and then the and then the police start, you know, we do we do things and and then but obviously that that poof

01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:23.900
That that that that that that swab from her vagina like

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:29.740
That was that that really tied it up boom. Oh, man, you're a Jimmy Kimmel. I

01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:39.460
The forensic files guy the voiceover guy, he's oh, I don't like that guy because he's always out of breath

01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:43.220
He's like and then a guy came in. No, come on

01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:47.140
And and and then the door was opened. How do you know?

01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:50.700
That guy is the show. How do you not like that guy?

01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:54.620
I don't like I don't like the guy. I like trying to bring some energy to the situation

01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:59.620
They're dead people. It's a story about a person that got slashed to pieces of this energy already

01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:05.100
What I did what I like about that guy is that he picks it up at the end when they get to the point where they're like finally

01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:09.420
Conclusively approved what the murder is and then he get the guy has to describe the murder

01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:13.220
So out of empathy he starts amping it up or he's the guy who did it and he's really

01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:20.800
Hard of beating a million miles in a second that'd be the greatest serial killer of all time who hosts his own show

01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:26.820
Like there's an arsonist that always goes back to the scene like watches the fire burn with the put with the fire department

01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:30.500
So science has proven that that guy did it and

01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:36.880
Join us next week. We're gonna get that little girls killer. Oh, she's not dead yet, but we'll get her

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:43.180
They also during the recap they incorporate all of the things like that they found

01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:50.400
Forensically so they make it sound like the person doing the crime did all these really weird specific microscopic things like pulling into the driveway

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.680
Angry about his girlfriend

01:46:52.680 --> 01:47:00.080
He got out of the car and as he did his fingertips touched the edge of the door leaving the grease stains later found by police

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:07.440
He yanked her hair pulled her down the driveway leaving a slight trail of grease and dandruff

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:13.480
That the dog would lick up and that the dog pathologist would find in the dogs and testings

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.700
Anyway, I'm not making my point clear. I don't know what my

01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:21.880
But it is science events so far that we can find dead people's dandruff and a dogs and testings

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:25.880
They had a really sad dog one that would have really bummed you out dog

01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:29.680
Got the dog because I'm the only one that likes dogs. Yeah, no

01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:35.320
That's it. The dog. You're the only one that like during our fascist takeover. You're like still tweeting like you said

01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:37.320
So take it to a dog last week

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:40.800
Last week you said there was a dog that got got shot

01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:45.480
But then the dog got the dog got shot and then he still at the end

01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:47.880
He got he tried to still he got shot

01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:52.540
Then he was like out of commission for a little bit and then the way that the guy got caught

01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:55.300
He was a Samoan gangster named sable claws

01:47:57.220 --> 01:48:02.940
How does it those gangs must be scary we've talked about that like cactus bunch and stuff like like if you're if you like these

01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:06.860
Gangs that when those get those gangs that have like silly names like you're oh man

01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:12.260
They must fucking just like I guess he was like in a Hannibal Lecter dolly in the court and it was just like I want to do it more

01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:20.180
But sable claws got busted only because the dog that he shot his name was chief

01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:26.620
He got shot in the fucking just like I guess he was like in a Hannibal Lecter dolly in the court

01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:28.620
And it was just like I want to do it more

01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:31.340
Fuck sable claws

01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:33.620
Yep

01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:36.780
But not you know not because he's Samoan because he's a gangster

01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:39.540
So I'll make that clear

01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:43.300
Samoans Samoans have provided us with a lot of like wonderful

01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:45.660
people

01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:50.860
Yes, Dwayne the Rock Johnson. I think is one of them. Maybe what are some of the inventions that Samoans?

01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:57.740
Made in history like famous inventions. They have a good cookie. That's the cookie

01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:05.220
The cookies every year. Yeah, well a lot of people don't know that Ben Franklin's key was Samoan

01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:21.260
I mean who asked that that sounds like that's something you ask on a racist website. Who would it Samoans provide for us?

01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:25.140
I found I'm cracking the case. What an Harriet Tubman invent

01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:32.900
Maybe she didn't get a chance

01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:39.980
You know, maybe Thomas Edison when he was born he was given like a bunch of light bulb assembly kits. We don't know

01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:48.980
Hey guys, we only had a couple minutes left you want to

Yo from the break it's on a fuck your mama all day and all afternoon long

01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:35.100
I served her tea I served her bread. I fucked your ear put my dick through her head

01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:39.940
Like she was Steve Martin like a wild crazy guy put an arrow going

01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:46.360
All she could see was the back of my deck because she was using the back of her eyeballs to look at shit

01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:52.820
That's how eyeballs work. They work on both sides. They're orcs and when you open them twice as wide you can see

01:51:52.820 --> 01:52:00.620
360,000 degrees and you see all the humanities on its knees because we've been abusing the planet of using our air

01:52:00.620 --> 01:52:03.700
We've got a hole in the ozone layer up there

01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:11.740
I fucked your mama in the space station a factor so hard that she was in celebration of my penis and my balls

01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:16.980
