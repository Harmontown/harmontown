WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Please give a big round of applause to director Neil Berkeley, Dan Harmon, Spencer Crittenden,

00:11.000 --> 00:17.240
all the fine folks who made that movie, and your guest comptroller for Harmontown Tonight

00:17.240 --> 00:37.240
is Kumail Nanjiani here. Where's Kumail? There he is. Dan, Dan, et cetera. There's our

00:37.240 --> 00:49.400
boy. All right. Yeah, we're kind of making the format up as we go. Oh, okay. So should

00:49.400 --> 00:54.600
I do the thing? I don't know. You could Q&A for a second. Are we recording for the podcast?

00:54.600 --> 00:59.080
Yes. Are we recording? Should I? Well, then I'm going to get the hell out of here. Do

00:59.080 --> 01:04.000
you want the Q&A to be part of, we could do it as part of the podcast. Do we do Q&A and

01:04.000 --> 01:09.320
then do the podcast? It's called Harmontown. I'm just worried that they watch a two-hour

01:09.320 --> 01:12.960
movie and then they're going to sit through the Q&A. We could do the Q&A as part of the

01:12.960 --> 01:18.840
podcast. Okay, let's do that. All right. So I'm going to introduce you. Pretend he's

01:18.840 --> 01:24.600
not here because the fuckers at home don't have visuals. And then he's going to walk

01:24.600 --> 01:31.720
out when I introduce him. Imagine me having really long, live legs. Yeah, he looks beautiful.

01:31.720 --> 01:41.720
Hey, everyone. Harmontown is now in session. Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmon

01:41.720 --> 01:53.040
Town, Dan Harmon. Oh, God. Oh, Los Angeles. Oh, God. I can't believe I found you here.

01:53.040 --> 02:00.440
Wow, you got up here pretty quickly. Thank you. Guest Comptroller Kumail Nanjiani, everybody.

02:00.440 --> 02:05.920
Nice back for Silicon Valley. He's not back. You're taking a break, right? Are you halfway

02:05.920 --> 02:09.360
through shooting? No, no, no. We're going to start shooting season two soon. We haven't

02:09.360 --> 02:13.200
started yet. We started. Oh, you haven't started yet? Mm-mm. We've been kind of just

02:13.200 --> 02:18.920
fucking around. Yeah. I don't know what they're doing. I think writing or something. We changed

02:18.920 --> 02:26.160
the words when we Sam. That's a lie. They're amazing. Harmontown fans will agree with

02:26.160 --> 02:32.320
me that I missed you so much. Oh, yeah, I've been gone a long time. The podcast people.

02:32.320 --> 02:39.320
Yeah. He's not in the movie, but the podcast itself really languishes in your absence.

02:39.320 --> 02:43.360
Oh, I'm sure that's not true, but I appreciate you saying that. Yeah, I really missed doing

02:43.360 --> 02:52.120
it. Every Sunday, I would be like, oh, right now, Harmontown is happening, and I'm alone

02:52.120 --> 02:57.080
in a horrible hotel room. So you think about me? I think about the show. I don't think

02:57.080 --> 03:01.040
about me. I mean, I think of the show as a whole as an entity separate from you. You're

03:01.040 --> 03:07.360
in your bed next to your wife. My wife wasn't with me when I was, but... That's all the

03:07.360 --> 03:14.280
better. I think of Harmon. I think of Jeff. I think of Spencer. Don't think about Jeff.

03:14.280 --> 03:18.680
Think about me. So we just watched this document. I'd never seen it before. Oh, yeah, we watched

03:18.680 --> 03:22.120
the documentary. Oh, did you really? That's the first time. Yeah, I thought it was awesome.

03:22.120 --> 03:25.920
It's really funny. Yeah, we're here in LA for you podcast listeners. We're at the Vista

03:25.920 --> 03:36.440
Theater in Los Feliz. And we just watched the Harmontown documentary, which is why

03:36.440 --> 03:41.560
my self-loathing is being really... They watched a two-hour movie about this shit. Now they're

03:41.560 --> 03:48.000
sitting here. We didn't have a bathroom break. I'm really self-conscious right now. I don't

03:48.000 --> 03:51.960
know what to do. I think people are going to get up and slowly file out. I wouldn't blame

03:51.960 --> 03:55.440
them if they did. Well, no, no, no. They love the movie. And we're going to... No, I know

03:55.440 --> 04:01.560
they did. Let's do a Q&A. I know they did. But they have families. They have lives. They

04:01.560 --> 04:09.800
don't have families. Did you watch your movie? This is the family. So we were asking in Seattle

04:09.800 --> 04:13.480
what we did is we showed the movie, then we did a Q&A, then we did the podcast. Seattle

04:13.480 --> 04:18.480
was awesome, by the way, for our friends in Seattle. You were amazing. Dino guest-controlled.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.840
He dropped the N-bomb right at the end of the show, just because he happened. By the

04:22.840 --> 04:27.360
way, that's a great time to drop it. It's towards the end. But I thought the remarkable

04:27.360 --> 04:31.760
cultural revolution that happened in Seattle is Dino did that. And the Seattle audience

04:31.760 --> 04:39.320
kind of just went... Black, white. They didn't care. They were like, I'm not going to let

04:39.320 --> 04:43.520
that hijack everything. Well, they'd seen a two-hour documentary and then a whole show

04:43.520 --> 04:47.240
and a Q&A. They had to go to the bathroom. Maybe. I don't know. But they were kind of

04:47.240 --> 04:51.040
like... The message I got from them was, yeah, edit it out. Don't let it... Don't let it

04:51.040 --> 04:55.720
fuck everything up. Did you edit it out? I did. Are you going to edit this out? No.

04:55.720 --> 05:01.160
Well, just because it's boring? No. No, because now if you... No, no, I...

05:01.160 --> 05:04.600
No, no, I... People will know that he used the N-bomb. Oh, no, no, no. I actually specifically

05:04.600 --> 05:10.080
want the people in Seattle to know those 200 people. I want you to know it wasn't a shame-based

05:10.080 --> 05:15.000
edit. It was like a kind of like actually answering your call to adventure because they sat there

05:15.000 --> 05:22.040
and were like, yeah, fuck that. We're not going to let the... Who cares? It's a dumb

05:22.040 --> 05:27.680
word. How do you guys feel about it? No, don't ask. Don't applaud. That feels weird.

05:27.680 --> 05:31.600
Let's try. On the count of three, let's say the N-word together and see how they react.

05:31.600 --> 05:40.480
And you guys don't react. Don't react. Be better than Seattle. One, two... Okay, alright.

05:40.480 --> 05:46.480
I can say it if I say the word sand before it. Yeah, you're allowed to. That's in all

05:46.480 --> 05:57.160
of your people's music. Yeah, what's up, my sand? Oh, yeah. Oh, one, two, one, two. Yo.

05:57.160 --> 06:02.640
Is that my people's music? I'm trying to improvise a Muslim rap. That's our call to prayer. Like

06:02.640 --> 06:07.680
actual Muslim rap. Hey, remember right after 9-11 when all the Muslim rappers kind of just

06:07.680 --> 06:14.560
got really quiet? Who were the Muslim rappers? Well, I don't know. I remember there was a

06:14.560 --> 06:20.120
lot of bow ties and a lot of anger in the 9-11 and it was like, okay, well, rap's one thing.

06:20.120 --> 06:26.040
9-11's another. I just remember it got really quiet, really fast. Yeah, I mean a lot of

06:26.040 --> 06:32.120
shit was going on after 9-11. I'm sure among them was that the Muslim rappers were like,

06:32.120 --> 06:36.600
we're going to lay low for a little bit. Yeah. This album is ready to go, but context has

06:36.600 --> 06:41.960
changed. I thought it was kind of funny. So should we... Do you guys have any questions?

06:41.960 --> 06:47.960
Just raise your hand. We're going to do the Q&A's part of the thing. Yeah, you guys could...

06:47.960 --> 06:51.280
Raise your hand. I'll call... Oh, you know, how about this? You guys can come and line

06:51.280 --> 06:55.680
up over here and then we could just go one by one. What do you think? Yep. Yeah, so if

06:55.680 --> 06:59.880
you guys... Yeah, we'll set that out there and you guys can come line up if you have

06:59.880 --> 07:06.600
questions and ask questions. We should bring... Other people that are going to be on, we

07:06.600 --> 07:11.600
should bring them on, right? We should bring Spencer out and we should bring every... Spencer!

07:11.600 --> 07:33.600
Get up here. Like a gazelle. I'm going to sit here instead. Yay! Yay! Yay! Hey, guys.

07:33.600 --> 07:39.680
No, we were doing the podcast. Oh, okay. All right. So do you have any questions? These

07:39.680 --> 07:43.760
guys get it. They're hip crowd. Well, we don't get it. How are they supposed to get it?

07:43.760 --> 07:49.480
We don't get it. Because they get us. All right. If there's any questions about the

07:49.480 --> 07:56.480
documentary, you just... You can go line up over there and then we can... Is one person

07:56.480 --> 08:02.320
a line? I feel like it needs to be a line segment. It's Toby from the office. Everybody

08:02.320 --> 08:11.320
loves him. So visually, that doesn't land. What's your name, sir? My name is Braden.

08:11.320 --> 08:19.320
Braden? Yep. What's your question, Braden? So, Mr. Dan, what... Did you have any decision

08:19.320 --> 08:24.000
making and what went into the film? And if not, what would you set the record straight

08:24.000 --> 08:31.680
on? I insisted that Neil put the pedophilia as an option if you have the gumption tongue

08:31.680 --> 08:37.680
twister in. He didn't put it in. And I was like, I was really funny in that moment. I

08:37.680 --> 08:45.440
improvised alliteration. Do you have any idea how difficult that is? The joke was socially

08:45.440 --> 08:52.800
unacceptable tongue twister. And I nailed it. Put it in the movie. And Neil was like,

08:52.800 --> 08:57.760
well, the chat, you know, Phoenix, you know, it's like, we've already done Crip Death.

08:57.760 --> 09:03.360
This feels like a whole other thing. Crip Death was my offer. I took it. I made the

09:03.360 --> 09:09.280
touchdown. Right. Yeah. Crip Death was the assist. You were the slam dunk. Yeah. Alley

09:09.280 --> 09:15.680
U. And it doesn't work. No one laughs at it. But no, I thought it was great. I was very

09:15.680 --> 09:19.880
proud of myself. That was about it, really. I just kept telling him, put the pedophile

09:19.880 --> 09:24.440
joke back in the movie. You keep leaving it out. I don't know what to tell you. That

09:24.440 --> 09:29.760
might be the first time that that note has been given. There was, I mean, there were

09:29.760 --> 09:35.640
several cuts of the movie. I had to make an agreement with Neil. The guy you're gesturing

09:35.640 --> 09:43.960
to didn't ask that question. Brayden sat down. Brayden sat down. Sorry. Brayden was pointing

09:43.960 --> 09:53.320
him out, though. Yeah. I had to let the director know. It's my tour. It's his movie. So come

09:53.320 --> 10:00.320
on, what may? And he was very respectful. Somebody shouted something out. Can we or

10:00.320 --> 10:07.720
did we? What did they say? They want us to bring the director on. Well, yeah. The director's

10:07.720 --> 10:14.920
mom is obviously in the audience. She's very proud. Please understand, ma'am. It's a very

10:14.920 --> 10:18.880
confusing time. We didn't know if it was a Q&A or a podcast. We don't know what we're

10:18.880 --> 10:22.560
doing. But you're right. You're absolutely right. He made it. Even though you're only

10:22.560 --> 10:27.400
saying that because you gave birth to him, we should probably bring the director on.

10:27.400 --> 10:35.480
Well, we should wait until she should go stand in line and then when it's her turn. But that's

10:35.480 --> 10:40.240
if it's just a Q&A. If it's Harmontown, if she can just wander up and go, I want to

10:40.240 --> 10:45.240
eat your face. That's what we've learned about the show. So Neil, come up here. Will you

10:45.240 --> 10:54.200
come up here, Neil, please? Is that actually Neil's mom? No, of course not. I'm just trying

10:54.200 --> 10:58.280
to take away. She's not very proud. She is sitting next to Neil, so I thought it might

10:58.280 --> 11:03.600
be it. What, Neil's mom is actually here? No, his mom, her mom. No, Neil hates his family.

11:03.600 --> 11:12.600
He's a filmmaker. That was Shannon Russo, wife of EP Joe Russo. I did that. Thank you.

11:12.600 --> 11:23.400
Yes, sir. Oh, yeah. First of all, I love the movie. I'll just say that up front. My question,

11:23.400 --> 11:27.880
I myself have just finished a lengthy road trip as well. So when you were on your road

11:27.880 --> 11:36.040
trip, were there any depths of personal hygiene that you sank to that surprised you?

11:36.040 --> 11:42.600
Wait, I'm glad I'm here because I was asked several times at other moments that weren't

11:42.600 --> 11:47.880
on camera. You've told the story before, but one story from the road that always makes

11:47.880 --> 11:53.080
me laugh, like I laughed about it this day, was when we broke down and you went back to

11:53.080 --> 11:59.520
get fries, like you need to remember that? The McDonald's fries. When the engine broke

11:59.520 --> 12:04.200
down? Yeah. And we got in and out fries and you weren't satisfied, so you went back to

12:04.200 --> 12:09.880
get McDonald's fries. That certainly sounds like a rock bottom.

12:09.880 --> 12:15.960
Wait, no. It's not an hygiene thing, but you hid them in the bag and in the bus because

12:15.960 --> 12:20.680
you got a quarter pounder as well? Yeah, I was shame eating in the bus.

12:20.680 --> 12:25.080
You wanted people to think you were eating in and out, but you were just eating McDonald's

12:25.080 --> 12:29.920
fries in the internet bag. Wait, so the best you could hope for was that people thinking

12:29.920 --> 12:34.920
you're eating slightly less shitty fast food? Yeah, I think at the time I was supposed to

12:34.920 --> 12:38.680
be on a diet with Aaron and I think, I don't know. In and out was part of the diet? I don't

12:38.680 --> 12:43.880
know. I can't remember. I remember going... No, you didn't like your enough fries. I'm

12:43.880 --> 12:47.080
going to cook some real fries. So you went to McDonald's and you bought fries, but you

12:47.080 --> 12:51.800
also bought a quarter pounder and a milkshake, and you put them all in the same bag and went

12:51.800 --> 12:57.720
in the bus and ate by yourself. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. No, it's fine. It feels a little

12:57.720 --> 13:06.000
bit like you're just picking on the fat kid, but I'm sure you're a movie maker. It was

13:06.000 --> 13:10.560
going to be either that or the pedophilia joke was going to be in the movie. Yes, guys,

13:10.560 --> 13:17.640
I ate extra fries. What's your name? Cameron. Cameron, it seems like you had some depth

13:17.640 --> 13:22.560
you wanted to tell us about. How do you know when you have a fake name? My name really

13:22.560 --> 13:27.760
is Cameron Cameron. That's a good sign. I don't know. I was just in my head thinking

13:27.760 --> 13:35.000
either it was having Wendy's three times in one day or not changing clothes for the first

13:35.000 --> 13:43.800
three days of the road trip. Well, what's your question? All of the depths of... That

13:43.800 --> 13:49.920
was just me. Yeah. But the question was, what were the depths of... Oh, the hygiene. Yeah.

13:49.920 --> 13:57.640
I mean, honestly, when I think when I'm moving, I probably shower more than usual, which is

13:57.640 --> 14:04.080
still not a lot. I think that when I'm stationary and I have a person that loves me, that's when

14:04.080 --> 14:12.200
I really push the limits. Like right now, there's like, I don't know, wallpaper peeling.

14:12.200 --> 14:16.880
I haven't showered in a long time. When was the last time you showered? I have no idea.

14:16.880 --> 14:25.360
No memory of it. Don't remember. The water stings my skin. It hurts. It hurts my skin.

14:25.360 --> 14:29.200
I know that the rest of you get into the shower. You like the feeling of it. And that's why

14:29.200 --> 14:35.320
you're not heroes for doing it. It's weird that you get out of something that you like

14:35.320 --> 14:40.400
and then come and find people like me and make fun of us. Because we're all just doing

14:40.400 --> 14:45.720
what we want to do. Sometimes you like to play basketball. Sometimes you like to take

14:45.720 --> 14:51.240
a shower. Then you come find me. How many showers did you take this month, bro? I don't

14:51.240 --> 15:00.080
know. Just guess or I'll punch you. I don't know, three? Three in a month? That's either

15:00.080 --> 15:06.600
too many or too little. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Every day

15:06.600 --> 15:14.200
is Babylon 5. I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want from me. How many

15:14.200 --> 15:23.880
times should I shower to make you happy? Three. Fuck you. Fuck you. I don't like it. It stings

15:23.880 --> 15:30.320
my skin. I like to take baths. I like to submerge myself in hot, soapy water. It takes a long

15:30.320 --> 15:37.800
time. I don't do that a lot either. I think that answers your question, Cameron.

15:37.800 --> 15:44.360
Thank you very much, Dan. Thank you, Cameron. But when you go to a hotel, they have nice

15:44.360 --> 15:49.280
showers. You go, well, as long as I'm here. Yeah, I was alone for a couple weeks in Baltimore,

15:49.280 --> 15:53.440
completely alone in a hotel room, and I was showering five, six times a day just to class

15:53.440 --> 15:59.000
the time. I remember, did you talk about that in Harmontown? Maybe. Maybe I was tweeting

15:59.000 --> 16:01.480
about it because I had nothing to do with the shower. You're like one of those guys

16:01.480 --> 16:05.920
that would tease me. What? No. Yeah, because you would then go, oh, I took a shower five

16:05.920 --> 16:10.440
times a day, and you'd be like, yeah, this is a new thing I can brag about. I was like,

16:10.440 --> 16:14.720
I don't, do you want it to do that? Why can't everyone just do what they want to do? I didn't

16:14.720 --> 16:19.360
say anything to you, Dan. No, I know. I was agreeing with you that when I'm moving and

16:19.360 --> 16:22.760
lonely, I shower more, but if I'm surrounded. Because you can't wait to get in there. That's

16:22.760 --> 16:28.120
crazy to me. You have to take off all your clothes. Well, you have to do that with a

16:28.120 --> 16:36.520
bath, too. No, I don't take a lot of those. You have to take all of your clothes off.

16:36.520 --> 16:42.560
You have a problem with nudity? That's just the energy expenditure. It's just everything,

16:42.560 --> 16:45.920
and then you're going to have to put it back on later, but you're going to be one. I feel

16:45.920 --> 16:52.920
like a hero every time I put pants on. I'm like, fuck, I'm so good at this. I hate it.

16:52.920 --> 16:56.320
Season three of Community, I came to a point where I was like, I got this. I'm going to

16:56.320 --> 17:04.680
wear my pajamas to work. I was really proud of myself for a while. I was like, I'm working

17:04.680 --> 17:10.400
on my pajamas, I'm coming to work on my pajamas, inspire leadership in my pajamas. Because

17:10.400 --> 17:15.920
the editor would see me and go, what are you doing? I'm doing what you can do. It's called

17:15.920 --> 17:25.240
fucking culture jamming. Why do you wear pajamas to bed? They're comfortable. Yeah. Well, you

17:25.240 --> 17:29.600
are going to dream little editor dreams in your little editor bed, in your editor pajamas.

17:29.600 --> 17:35.960
Wear them to work, motherfucker. That's the version of you I want. Relax, sleepy you. Culture

17:35.960 --> 17:37.560
jamming. Culture jamming.

17:37.560 --> 17:46.280
If you have a question about culture jamming, it's already been answered.

17:46.280 --> 17:50.680
It's not about culture jamming. This is for Dan and Neil. Anne Spencer, what is, and this

17:50.680 --> 17:55.000
is kind of a twist on the first question, something that wasn't included in the movie,

17:55.000 --> 18:00.400
but not for content, but maybe just had to be cut for time or didn't fit the tone that

18:00.400 --> 18:02.200
you wish could have been in there?

18:02.200 --> 18:07.080
Honestly, I feel compelled to tell this story just because I think it's interesting, because

18:07.080 --> 18:12.680
I think there was this moment, there was this big thing in the documentary that Neil kept

18:12.680 --> 18:20.040
including where I jokingly called Aaron the C-word. It was like 10 minutes into the movie.

18:20.040 --> 18:25.080
We had just gotten out of the road, and Neil, I don't want to say you thought it was funny,

18:25.080 --> 18:29.480
and I'm going to make you sound like you're some kind of weirdo, but you were like, well,

18:29.480 --> 18:33.040
it's obviously a joke. It says a lot about your relationship, because Aaron thought it

18:33.040 --> 18:37.320
was funny, and we were like, joke about it, but it didn't translate. The bottom line is

18:37.320 --> 18:44.840
things like the C-word, for instance. It changes the experience in the movie you're watching.

18:44.840 --> 18:49.080
So I was saying to Neil, I want you to understand that I do not want to look like a good person

18:49.080 --> 18:55.240
in this movie, but I also want you to understand that that early in the film, that's going

18:55.240 --> 18:59.760
to be like this weird, if you went on a roller coaster and just a pelican dropped into your

18:59.760 --> 19:05.280
lap, it changes the roller coaster. Is this a Wild West theme roller coaster? Is it a

19:05.280 --> 19:09.760
space theme roller coaster? It doesn't matter. Now it's a pelican themed roller coaster.

19:09.760 --> 19:14.240
It changes the audience's experience. Save that shit for later. Aaron says later, he

19:14.240 --> 19:18.080
called me the C-word and you hear the audience, boo, it's part of the story.

19:18.080 --> 19:24.160
Yeah, you can't have two subplots about the C-word. No, it's just a bit. It's like, oh,

19:24.160 --> 19:28.880
they're hilarious together. It does not translate, trust me. It was like, remember when I, in

19:28.880 --> 19:35.840
the movie, when I go to hubris to go on the perfect tour, tour, tour, and I do a fake

19:35.840 --> 19:40.800
echo on my own, and then Aaron says, why are you doing the echo? They can do the echo

19:40.800 --> 19:46.560
later, and I'm like, that's the bit. It's meta. It's like if we did a documentary about

19:46.560 --> 19:50.240
how we fight all the time, and then she says, we don't fight all the time, and I'm like,

19:50.240 --> 19:54.560
yes, we do. And she's like, no, we don't. And we start fighting and it's a funny bit

19:54.560 --> 20:01.160
and it culminates in me calling her the C-word. And it's hilarious in our lives and not a

20:01.160 --> 20:04.600
good thing to happen 10 minutes into the movie. So that's an example.

20:04.600 --> 20:07.840
At the time, it was a character thing, but it says a lot of people have asked like, what

20:07.840 --> 20:12.120
was it like to make a movie with a guy who's in the movie he's producing? And that was

20:12.120 --> 20:15.280
a note where, damn, there was a moment where at the very end, you said, look, I'll tell

20:15.280 --> 20:20.480
you one last time, I've been in rooms where people have said the C-word and the N-word,

20:20.480 --> 20:24.080
the G-word, the Q-word. Get ready and we look at it.

20:24.080 --> 20:32.840
Is Q-word just cunt with a Q? No, it's Q-word. People are really sensitive about Q and C's.

20:32.840 --> 20:37.120
Thank you. Thank you. So that's when it came out, as I was like,

20:37.120 --> 20:40.640
okay, I hear what you're saying. I understand that note. It's not about you being a good

20:40.640 --> 20:43.720
person or a bad person. You're talking about losing an audience.

20:43.720 --> 20:47.200
Yeah, I had to promise. I'm going to swear to God I'm not. I'm not trying to make myself

20:47.200 --> 20:52.160
look cool here. Just please don't keep that part in. I think that answered your question.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.960
I don't know. Does that answer that one?

20:53.960 --> 20:58.520
I mean, this doesn't really qualify as an answer to your question, but every time I

20:58.520 --> 21:03.920
see it, there's this guy wearing this orange brown beanie cap and you see him twice in

21:03.920 --> 21:07.640
the whole movie and they're really close together. And that guy gave me that beanie

21:07.640 --> 21:11.680
during one of the shows. And every time I see it, I'm like, that beanie has a story

21:11.680 --> 21:18.440
to it. That only I know. And no one else is going to know this, but now you guys do,

21:18.440 --> 21:20.880
maybe. Wait, was your question about things that were

21:20.880 --> 21:24.360
not in the movie? What ended up outside the movie?

21:24.360 --> 21:28.800
Oh, yes. I will tell you this. Soon. All right. I fucked up my answer.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.440
No, no, no. Your answer was totally good, right?

21:32.440 --> 21:37.920
But soon, next week, someday, you'll all learn that there's going to be a place, I don't

21:37.920 --> 21:40.280
know what I can talk about, but there's going to be a place on the Internet where you can

21:40.280 --> 21:45.720
go there called harm attend dot com and see the making of chicken noodle dick.

21:45.720 --> 21:49.800
That's which it's a it's a scene that didn't make it in the movie, but it's it's pretty

21:49.800 --> 21:52.320
amazing and I can't wait for you all to see it.

21:52.320 --> 21:55.880
It is kind of interesting because we got high and we're on the bus and we're just laying

21:55.880 --> 22:00.880
there giggling and but it takes forever because you don't want to jump cut within it.

22:00.880 --> 22:06.440
Well, it takes like six. There's a there's a honey bear dick song and there's a aspirin

22:06.440 --> 22:12.600
dick. There's several dicks that were sung about until chicken noodle became the Huckleberry.

22:12.600 --> 22:16.600
Yeah.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.760
The Huckleberry of what? What does that mean?

22:19.760 --> 22:22.040
Yeah, I didn't get that either. What is Huckleberry?

22:22.040 --> 22:24.200
We almost just glide glid glid.

22:24.200 --> 22:28.680
Are you just trying to start a new like phrase? You're trying to slip it in?

22:28.680 --> 22:34.120
No, that's fucking Huckleberry anyway. Neil, that's not a thing anyone says.

22:34.120 --> 22:40.120
I spread that instead of saying Huckleberry, your Huckleberry, it's from the tombstone.

22:40.120 --> 22:46.120
Oh, yeah, that movie that is part of the Mexican.

22:46.120 --> 22:53.000
It's like you were referencing Wizard of Oz.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.680
Why did people quote that thing? He goes, I'll be a Huckleberry and everyone's like,

22:56.680 --> 22:59.960
yeah, what a badass. What the fuck is he talking about?

22:59.960 --> 23:02.840
I never got that, Neil. What the fuck are you talking about?

23:02.840 --> 23:04.360
I don't know. I don't know what it means.

23:04.360 --> 23:07.320
I'm your Huckleberry. What do you mean you're his Huckleberry?

23:07.320 --> 23:10.680
Like, he's Tom Sawyer? Don't shoot him then.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.560
Oh, it must be that. That makes a lot of sense, actually.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.160
Was that book contemporary?

23:15.160 --> 23:20.840
Well, it was Mark Twain's classic, and you know, Huckleberry was like, I'm the grounded

23:20.840 --> 23:21.840
sidekick.

23:21.840 --> 23:26.280
I'm your Huckleberry, and he's like dying against a tree.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.280
How are you my Huckleberry?

23:27.280 --> 23:28.280
I didn't see the movie.

23:28.280 --> 23:33.000
You should check it out. It's a really good movie.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.360
Also watch Silverado.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.880
Also read Huck Finn.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.120
Yeah, sure.

23:37.120 --> 23:40.920
If you love the N-word.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.640
Also read Huck Finn.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.680
If you love the N-word.

23:45.680 --> 23:50.800
If you love the N-word, you'll love the new Toyota Corolla.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.760
Sponsor of Hamilton.

23:53.760 --> 23:54.760
Smooth.

23:54.760 --> 23:55.760
Smooth.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.480
I don't know what that sounds like. Go ahead.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.040
Hi, I'm Adam.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.440
Adam, nice to meet you.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.880
I have a question for Dan, and then one for Spencer.

24:03.880 --> 24:04.880
Yes.

24:04.880 --> 24:05.880
So Dan.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.880
I'm sorry, after you ask the question, you're going to have to go to the back of the line.

24:08.880 --> 24:09.880
Ask Spencer.

24:09.880 --> 24:14.560
All right, Dan, what was the feeling like when NBC got ahold of you and were like, hey, we're

24:14.560 --> 24:15.560
sorry.

24:15.560 --> 24:16.560
Come back.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.640
They did. That didn't happen.

24:19.640 --> 24:22.120
These things don't happen.

24:22.120 --> 24:26.080
If you ever are privileged to be fired from a television show, the way you find out is

24:26.080 --> 24:29.400
your agent tells you, and then your agent tells you you've been rehired.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.400
That's it.

24:30.400 --> 24:37.000
It doesn't, none of the suits actually meet you and say that they are your Huckleberry.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
They don't.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
No.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.480
There's no boom box outside the window.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.880
That's from a movie called Say Anything.

24:43.880 --> 24:47.960
You know how in firing squads, I don't know if you know this, when they used to shoot

24:47.960 --> 24:51.120
people to kill them officially.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.800
They would, one person would have a blank.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.880
They would put one blank in it.

24:55.880 --> 25:00.080
It's a systemic, you know, unaccountability.

25:00.080 --> 25:04.720
Each person gets to think, I'm probably not the one actually killing this person.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.760
I'm probably a hero.

25:06.760 --> 25:09.280
That's television.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.120
Everyone just goes, hey, what am I doing?

25:11.120 --> 25:12.120
I don't know.

25:12.120 --> 25:13.120
Fuck it.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.120
My parents are rich.

25:14.120 --> 25:15.440
I'll just do this.

25:15.440 --> 25:21.880
And then if you get fired, you find out not by anybody telling you anything that would

25:21.880 --> 25:26.760
ever reflect poorly on them, you find out by the phone not ringing.

25:26.760 --> 25:32.440
And then when you get rehired, again, it's like, hey, I guess I'm back.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.520
Yeah, it's not exciting.

25:34.520 --> 25:37.640
So fuck you, kid.

25:37.640 --> 25:40.440
Adam, your question for Spencer?

25:40.440 --> 25:43.760
Spencer, what's your favorite addition of D&D to play?

25:43.760 --> 25:49.040
We play Pathfinder, which is an officially D&D, as it were, but it counts.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.040
It counts.

25:50.040 --> 25:54.240
Fifth edition of official D&Ds just came out, and I'd recommend it to new players.

25:54.240 --> 25:57.280
It's a very joyless sounding answer.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.280
I love that.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.280
Thank you.

25:59.280 --> 26:00.280
Thank you.

26:00.280 --> 26:01.280
Hi.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.280
I'm Mark.

26:02.280 --> 26:10.600
This question for Dan, since they didn't get picked up, can we kind of know what those

26:10.600 --> 26:13.120
pilots were about in the movie?

26:13.120 --> 26:21.360
The CVS pilot was, it was sort of an absolutely fabulous kind of rip-off.

26:21.360 --> 26:31.640
It was about a, it was actually my fiancee, Aaron's idea, it was about a guy who had been

26:31.640 --> 26:39.000
a rock star in the 90s who had returned to his hometown and opened a bar.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.840
And he was in his 40s, and he was just running this bar, and kind of, he was, you know, he

26:43.840 --> 26:50.240
was the consummate non-sellout, and a former rock star who people would come to his bar

26:50.240 --> 26:54.160
and be like, oh man, this fucking guy used to be in this thing, and he's not a sellout.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.640
He owns this bar now.

26:55.640 --> 27:00.440
And then this 15-year-old girl walks in, and the pilot, she's his previously unknown

27:00.440 --> 27:01.440
daughter.

27:01.440 --> 27:02.440
Huckleberry.

27:02.440 --> 27:08.560
She's his Huckleberry, and she wants to come live with him so she can get into an art school

27:08.560 --> 27:13.720
that if she, if she has a residence there in that city, she can go to this art school

27:13.720 --> 27:14.720
that she wants to go to.

27:14.720 --> 27:20.600
So it's really ABFAB, it's with a dude, which hopefully would have been Jack Black, but then

27:20.600 --> 27:23.120
he didn't want to do it, so it died.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.120
But it was pretty cool.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.120
I haven't read it.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.120
That sounds good.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.120
You haven't read it?

27:27.120 --> 27:28.120
Well, I haven't read it since I gave it to him.

27:28.120 --> 27:29.120
It might suck.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.120
But I thought it was pretty good.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.280
That does sound awesome.

27:31.280 --> 27:32.280
What was the Fox one?

27:32.280 --> 27:33.280
I don't know.

27:33.280 --> 27:39.240
Actually, the Fox thing, the Fox thing was going to be like 30 Rock in a video game studio.

27:39.240 --> 27:44.200
Basically, it was going to be like, yeah, I mean, if you wait long enough, everyone

27:44.200 --> 27:45.920
that hired you gets fired.

27:45.920 --> 27:49.280
So like the Fox that I worked for doesn't exist anymore.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.400
It's every all different people now.

27:51.400 --> 27:52.400
It doesn't matter.

27:52.400 --> 27:58.520
It's not like there's some guy going, I'm Mr. Fox, you regret this decision.

27:58.520 --> 28:02.400
You just signed a deal with some guy named like Kevin Johnson, and then Kevin Johnson

28:02.400 --> 28:04.040
was like, now I'm at CBS.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.040
Oh, shit.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.040
It doesn't matter.

28:06.040 --> 28:07.040
It's fine.

28:07.040 --> 28:16.440
Hey, I just want to point out that I thought it was pretty funny.

28:16.440 --> 28:21.480
You guys jumping onto, making fun of someone for making a film reference that was like,

28:21.480 --> 28:24.840
it was like, oh, we're all nerds here, but that's seen with Val Kilmer.

28:24.840 --> 28:25.840
No one was going to reference that.

28:25.840 --> 28:26.840
I wasn't going to get that.

28:26.840 --> 28:27.840
What's kind of funny?

28:27.840 --> 28:28.840
I'm joking.

28:28.840 --> 28:34.880
I was, because we jumped on him, I was jumping on you to make a joke, and then it just came

28:34.880 --> 28:35.880
across as me.

28:35.880 --> 28:36.880
It's okay.

28:36.880 --> 28:37.880
You blocked me on Twitter.

28:37.880 --> 28:38.880
It's fine.

28:38.880 --> 28:39.880
I get it.

28:39.880 --> 28:40.880
I did block you?

28:40.880 --> 28:41.880
Yeah.

28:41.880 --> 28:42.880
Oh, okay.

28:42.880 --> 28:43.880
You probably just served it.

28:43.880 --> 28:44.880
Yeah, I did.

28:44.880 --> 28:45.880
What did you do?

28:45.880 --> 28:51.040
I think I was really happy that Emily followed me, and I was like, oh, your Twitter follow

28:51.040 --> 28:54.880
that's soon going to follow going to be hack or something, and then after that I was blocked.

28:54.880 --> 28:55.880
Oh, no.

28:55.880 --> 28:56.880
It must have been a mistake.

28:56.880 --> 28:57.880
That doesn't sound like a blockable.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.640
That's something else that I surely...

28:59.640 --> 29:00.640
The fuck is going on?

29:00.640 --> 29:01.640
See?

29:01.640 --> 29:02.640
He's asking for it.

29:02.640 --> 29:03.640
I don't know.

29:03.640 --> 29:04.640
Anyway, go ahead.

29:04.640 --> 29:05.640
Yeah, okay.

29:05.640 --> 29:06.640
Sorry about that.

29:06.640 --> 29:08.640
My questions are for Spencer, actually.

29:08.640 --> 29:09.640
Yes.

29:09.640 --> 29:10.640
To Parter.

29:10.640 --> 29:11.640
Oh, thank...

29:11.640 --> 29:12.640
No.

29:12.640 --> 29:18.760
Number one, I'm kind of new to the world of D&D, I just got into it for professional

29:18.760 --> 29:19.760
reasons.

29:19.760 --> 29:20.760
Wait.

29:20.760 --> 29:21.760
Wow.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.640
Are you trying to get a job in Hollywood?

29:23.640 --> 29:24.640
No.

29:24.640 --> 29:25.640
Yeah.

29:25.640 --> 29:29.880
I really want to be the second host, like the other guy on the couch.

29:29.880 --> 29:30.880
My god.

29:30.880 --> 29:31.880
I don't have a couch.

29:31.880 --> 29:32.880
Okay.

29:32.880 --> 29:33.880
I don't even own a couch.

29:33.880 --> 29:37.400
Somebody get this guy a couch.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.400
Trevor?

29:38.400 --> 29:39.400
Xanthan?

29:39.400 --> 29:42.720
Ah, Xanthan.

29:42.720 --> 29:45.440
He can haul a couch.

29:45.440 --> 29:53.080
It's just for game design, but I noticed a lot of other game designers have this really

29:53.080 --> 29:56.720
personal deep relationship where they really cherish their D&D memories, just role-playing

29:56.720 --> 30:03.640
game memories in general, and a lot of them saw it as not just their first introduction

30:03.640 --> 30:08.520
to rules and systems for a game, but also for building a community and having social

30:08.520 --> 30:09.520
interaction that you're kind of...

30:09.520 --> 30:12.440
You don't want to be lame and be like, oh man, I miss my friends if I don't see them

30:12.440 --> 30:13.440
every week.

30:13.440 --> 30:16.760
But so you put that all into like, hey, we've got to play this game every week, right?

30:16.760 --> 30:19.920
We have this social contract to hang out with each other and work our shit out because

30:19.920 --> 30:21.320
we have to play this game every week.

30:21.320 --> 30:25.600
I was wondering if that was your experience with D&D?

30:25.600 --> 30:28.280
Like having really fond memories of building communities?

30:28.280 --> 30:31.760
Yeah, and playing with friends, making it very social.

30:31.760 --> 30:38.080
I mean, that's all, in my opinion, that's the worst part of Dungeons & Dragons is that

30:38.080 --> 30:44.280
it really brings out the darkness in interpersonal relationships, and they always come to the

30:44.280 --> 30:45.280
surface.

30:45.280 --> 30:50.160
If it turns out you really hate your friend's haircut, like in Dungeons & Dragons, you're

30:50.160 --> 30:57.000
going to get in a fistfight over that, and the rules have been my refuge from thinking

30:57.000 --> 31:00.800
about all the social problems that I've experienced.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.800
It's been kind of nightmarish.

31:02.800 --> 31:08.080
I've lost like three groups of friends, probably, that just hate each other because of Dungeons

31:08.080 --> 31:15.320
& Dragons games, so I mean, I wish I could, yeah, but it breaks up families.

31:15.320 --> 31:20.120
Maybe I already have the answer to part two of my question was like, would you think about

31:20.120 --> 31:25.600
doing like a game at PAX or something like that, I think, that might draw a crowd.

31:25.600 --> 31:29.960
I'll do whatever anyone will, you know, pay for.

31:29.960 --> 31:32.080
Not pay me for, but like get me out there.

31:32.080 --> 31:33.640
He's like Alex P. Keaton over here.

31:33.640 --> 31:35.840
I don't, you know, I don't got much going on.

31:35.840 --> 31:42.280
I don't, you know, I don't have to do it for the love of the game, man, love the game,

31:42.280 --> 31:43.280
man.

31:43.280 --> 31:44.280
Thank you.

31:44.280 --> 31:45.280
Thanks, man.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.480
This is a great two part question, by the way.

31:48.480 --> 31:51.960
I shit all over the second part.

31:51.960 --> 31:53.760
You know, two part questions are bullshit.

31:53.760 --> 31:54.760
Yeah.

31:54.760 --> 31:55.760
Everybody does that.

31:55.760 --> 31:56.760
You're basically cheating.

31:56.760 --> 31:57.760
Yes.

31:57.760 --> 31:58.760
Like what?

31:58.760 --> 32:00.400
I have a, hello, I'm Oliver Twist.

32:00.400 --> 32:06.320
I have a two part bowl that I like filled with soup.

32:06.320 --> 32:07.760
Obviously that's not allowed.

32:07.760 --> 32:13.520
It's not allowed, that's, you're just, you're describing a tray.

32:13.520 --> 32:19.520
Yeah, so what's your Twitter handle?

32:19.520 --> 32:29.520
It's a double question at 69.twitter, I don't know how Twitter works.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.000
All right, Benny and June, let's go.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.600
So first off, I love the movie.

32:34.600 --> 32:35.600
First off, I love the movie.

32:35.600 --> 32:39.600
Sorry to sound like a broken record, but I was wondering since Yahoo's been our savior

32:39.600 --> 32:44.400
and is bringing back community, if you're looking forward to rubbing it in NBC's face.

32:44.400 --> 32:49.480
Well they still own, NBC still owns the show, I mean, so it's like as successful as the

32:49.480 --> 32:55.080
show is, then they'll be like, thank you, I don't know, there's no way out of it.

32:55.080 --> 32:59.880
If you're making a show for, the only way to get revenge on all the suits in the world

32:59.880 --> 33:05.200
is to make something in your sandbox that they don't own, and then no one gets to see

33:05.200 --> 33:06.200
it.

33:06.200 --> 33:10.480
And you're really brave in 23, which you are, and you could, like, don't work with

33:10.480 --> 33:12.400
Sony and NBC and all that stuff.

33:12.400 --> 33:16.640
But if you are, if you have gone down that road and you've created a show, like community,

33:16.640 --> 33:21.920
that has NBC's money in it, Sony's money in it, and now Yahoo's money in it, you know,

33:21.920 --> 33:27.320
you can't really get revenge on anybody, you're in it with the fans and the money's coming

33:27.320 --> 33:28.960
from everywhere and you can't.

33:28.960 --> 33:33.400
It's weird because I guess if it succeeds, they get money, and if it loses, well they

33:33.400 --> 33:35.400
were right for canceling it.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.400
Yeah.

33:36.400 --> 33:39.000
And in either case, they're not going to care.

33:39.000 --> 33:46.520
It's like, you know, NBC's going to be a food channel by then, or the most important network

33:46.520 --> 33:47.520
in the world.

33:47.520 --> 33:48.520
I mean, we don't know.

33:48.520 --> 33:49.520
Everything changes every year.

33:49.520 --> 33:53.120
I caught myself because I was quoted on TMZ as saying something.

33:53.120 --> 33:57.760
Yeah, NBC will be a food network in a year.

33:57.760 --> 34:03.600
Dan Harmon slams Food Network.

34:03.600 --> 34:07.960
Their job isn't to care and our job isn't to get revenge on them because there is no

34:07.960 --> 34:08.960
them.

34:08.960 --> 34:11.120
That's the problem with them is that they're not them.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.440
We are them.

34:12.440 --> 34:13.600
They aren't them.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.480
They are corporations.

34:15.480 --> 34:18.200
The them is inside of us.

34:18.200 --> 34:22.360
If you compete with them, then you're going to fuck the them that you are.

34:22.360 --> 34:26.800
Like the only them that is is Vince Gilligan and people who make shows.

34:26.800 --> 34:30.800
Like the people who make the costumes and the props and they actually roll the cameras

34:30.800 --> 34:31.800
and stuff.

34:31.800 --> 34:36.240
There's the them and Los Angeles is filled with them and then there's the them that's

34:36.240 --> 34:43.280
like what, the logo, natgeo.org or whatever you end up airing on.

34:43.280 --> 34:47.680
Those people, if they're the good guys or the bad guys, you're equally psychotic because

34:47.680 --> 34:50.080
you have to just make a product.

34:50.080 --> 34:56.480
I was wondering when we can expect the Spencer brand D20s to be in store.

34:56.480 --> 34:57.480
Oh man.

34:57.480 --> 34:58.480
You're like Peter North.

34:58.480 --> 35:00.800
You're like Peter North.

35:00.800 --> 35:04.760
The negotiations with Chessix Dice have really gone south.

35:04.760 --> 35:11.200
I'm going to have to get my own injection mold and it's a real to do.

35:11.200 --> 35:12.200
Thank you.

35:12.200 --> 35:13.200
Hi, I'm Evan.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.200
Nice to meet you all.

35:14.200 --> 35:19.200
Hey Evan, nice to meet you.

35:19.200 --> 35:23.120
My question is between like, you know, writing the pilot scripts and like making songs about

35:23.120 --> 35:24.120
Pringles' dicks.

35:24.120 --> 35:28.280
What kinds of things do you, what kinds of things did you do between tourists the past

35:28.280 --> 35:29.780
of time?

35:29.780 --> 35:30.780
That's it.

35:30.780 --> 35:33.200
I mean, the Pringles' dick song and the, what is he sleeping?

35:33.200 --> 35:34.200
Sleepy.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.200
What's the past of time?

35:35.200 --> 35:36.200
Sleepy.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.200
I don't know.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.200
You play video games?

35:38.200 --> 35:39.200
Song stuff.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.200
Now, just Minecraft.

35:40.200 --> 35:41.200
That's it.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.080
But that deserves to be talked about on a level of like heroin.

35:43.080 --> 35:45.200
Like I have a problem right now.

35:45.200 --> 35:48.700
Like season six of community is going to be worse because of Minecraft.

35:48.700 --> 35:50.200
It's going to be a Minecraft episode.

35:50.200 --> 35:51.800
It's like that's like your edition.

35:51.800 --> 35:52.800
I don't know.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.720
I keep saying to the writers, we should do a Minecraft episode, but it's like, it's

35:55.720 --> 35:57.960
like a junkie saying we should do a heroin episode.

35:57.960 --> 36:02.080
And they're like, yeah, I bet we should.

36:02.080 --> 36:05.280
That would make you real happy, wouldn't it, boss?

36:05.280 --> 36:09.720
Make that needle dangling out of your arm like a prop instead of a fucking thing that

36:09.720 --> 36:12.080
we need to deal with.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.080
Clean up your act.

36:13.080 --> 36:17.920
And I guess it's like, this kind of involves Spencer, but what inspired you to have him

36:17.920 --> 36:20.040
in the VCR episode?

36:20.040 --> 36:22.040
Is everyone asking many questions?

36:22.040 --> 36:23.040
What are the rules?

36:23.040 --> 36:24.040
I don't know, man.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.040
What are the rules?

36:25.040 --> 36:28.640
Is this a Q and A or a podcast?

36:28.640 --> 36:29.640
I don't know.

36:29.640 --> 36:33.840
I mean, we know it's obviously we're into Harmontown.

36:33.840 --> 36:34.840
We're into Harmontown.

36:34.840 --> 36:35.840
Yeah.

36:35.840 --> 36:39.240
It's the worst Harmontown ever and the best Q and A ever.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.240
That's right.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.240
This is the Venn diagram.

36:42.240 --> 36:43.240
Overlap.

36:43.240 --> 36:44.240
I don't know what words mean.

36:44.240 --> 36:45.240
Go ahead.

36:45.240 --> 36:46.240
What happened?

36:46.240 --> 36:47.240
Was there a question?

36:47.240 --> 36:48.240
The audience?

36:48.240 --> 36:49.240
Yeah.

36:49.240 --> 36:52.120
What inspired having Spencer on the VCR episode?

36:52.120 --> 36:53.120
Oh, that's not to me.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.120
That's you.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.120
I thought of you.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.120
I didn't inspire it.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.120
I don't know.

36:57.120 --> 37:01.200
I kind of feel like he's, he looks like he could be Alice and Bree's brother.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.200
I don't know.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.200
Yeah.

37:03.200 --> 37:07.480
He's a beautiful viking, like with these piercing eyes.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.480
He does have a very handsome face.

37:09.480 --> 37:10.480
I do.

37:10.480 --> 37:11.480
I honestly can't remember.

37:11.480 --> 37:12.480
I don't know.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.480
No.

37:13.480 --> 37:14.480
I know what it was.

37:14.480 --> 37:17.040
I guess I can't answer this question.

37:17.040 --> 37:21.120
There was a character who, well, it's fine to say plots that are never going to happen.

37:21.120 --> 37:22.120
Yeah.

37:22.120 --> 37:24.160
I mean, we were pitching a story about Britta.

37:24.160 --> 37:29.280
About Britta hooking up with Annie's brother, and that plot line kind of fell away and transmitted

37:29.280 --> 37:30.720
into this different plot line.

37:30.720 --> 37:36.680
Annie's brother was going to be like a photojournalist who was like a Mark Ruffalo type, who Britta

37:36.680 --> 37:39.560
immediately pounced on and was going to cause a stripe between them.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.560
It's like the boy next door kind of thing.

37:41.560 --> 37:45.400
It felt a little uninspired, and then I was like, what if, what, what, what is Annie's

37:45.400 --> 37:46.760
brother not supposed to be?

37:46.760 --> 37:50.000
The characterization of that kind of fell away, and then there was like, oh, I guess

37:50.000 --> 37:54.320
anyone can do it, and then someone put like Viking type in the, in the script, and then

37:54.320 --> 37:57.200
everyone thought it was me, and then I got cast.

37:57.200 --> 38:01.960
The writers were quite taken with him, because I had this guy coming in, and then he'd go

38:01.960 --> 38:05.840
like, Dan, what size are your pants?

38:05.840 --> 38:08.000
And so the writers were like, who is that?

38:08.000 --> 38:12.160
That's my dungeon master.

38:12.160 --> 38:17.000
You also had a documentary that desperately needed an ending.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
That's true as well.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Yes.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.680
Wait, can I do the honorable thing, and that is not going to go well?

38:24.680 --> 38:27.120
Is there a movie question for me in the line?

38:27.120 --> 38:28.120
Okay.

38:28.120 --> 38:29.120
Can you come?

38:29.120 --> 38:30.120
Okay, Evan, thank you.

38:30.120 --> 38:31.120
I will eject.

38:31.120 --> 38:32.120
That's not honorable.

38:32.120 --> 38:34.120
You want to eject?

38:34.120 --> 38:36.920
That sounds like the worst like thing to say during sex.

38:36.920 --> 38:38.920
No, I want like, just eject.

38:38.920 --> 38:40.920
All right, here it is.

38:40.920 --> 38:45.960
I saw you guys on the Massachusetts tour stop, so it's really cool to see it all finished.

38:45.960 --> 38:49.320
Did you know what the emotional premise or main storyline of the movie would be before

38:49.320 --> 38:54.480
during shooting, or did you figure out the true focus during the editing process?

38:54.480 --> 38:55.720
The latter, yes.

38:55.720 --> 39:00.280
We went out, I met Dan on Thanksgiving of 2012.

39:00.280 --> 39:05.720
I shot my first Harmontown on December 3rd, and we hit the road on January 9th.

39:05.720 --> 39:09.400
I had never listened to a podcast until he emailed me.

39:09.400 --> 39:12.240
I hadn't talked to him very much.

39:12.240 --> 39:15.720
We had, I had no idea what this movie would be about, totally honest.

39:15.720 --> 39:19.280
He had an idea, I had an idea of what I think it should be.

39:19.280 --> 39:22.960
We went out and we just chased story the whole time we were out there.

39:22.960 --> 39:26.880
We looked for things, and halfway through we had an idea of what it might be about, but

39:26.880 --> 39:31.520
there was a long editorial process that went through a lot of different stages, ups and

39:31.520 --> 39:37.680
downs, and good stories, bad stories, good movies, and bad movies, and we came out.

39:37.680 --> 39:42.360
And Erin McGathy actually about Midway said, just make this movie about Spencer.

39:42.360 --> 39:45.160
And there is a cut that exists that is all about Spencer.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.160
But that...

39:46.160 --> 39:47.160
Don't clap for that.

39:47.160 --> 39:49.680
You'll never see it.

39:49.680 --> 39:54.040
Spencer's mom is here too, I guess.

39:54.040 --> 39:58.480
But it triggered a lot of light bulbs went off when we made that cut.

39:58.480 --> 40:01.280
And it turned into the cut you saw today.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.440
But no, it took a lot of editorial.

40:03.440 --> 40:06.240
And if I may, there are two guys, can I do a quick question?

40:06.240 --> 40:07.240
Sure, sure.

40:07.240 --> 40:08.240
Do you mind?

40:08.240 --> 40:09.240
I'm sorry.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.520
There are two guys in the audience that I failed to thank, and thank God this is being

40:11.520 --> 40:16.200
podcasted, but James Lesh is here tonight, he's an editor on this movie, who was with

40:16.200 --> 40:23.640
me the whole process, and Academy Award-winning Kevin Klobber, who cut Crossfire Hurricane,

40:23.640 --> 40:24.640
the Pearl Jam doc.

40:24.640 --> 40:29.160
You're just embarrassing this movie and the soon-to-be Kurt Cobain doc, he's a genius,

40:29.160 --> 40:32.000
and he's the reason that this movie exists.

40:32.000 --> 40:37.120
So thank those guys.

40:37.120 --> 40:39.680
Thank you.

40:39.680 --> 40:43.800
This is a question for Spencer, but what do you decide is welcome by U3, should you have

40:43.800 --> 40:44.800
them?

40:44.800 --> 40:50.320
I'm wondering, any chance of a Spencer podcast?

40:50.320 --> 40:53.160
Do you have any ideas?

40:53.160 --> 40:55.960
Maybe call it The Critten Den, I don't know, something like that.

40:55.960 --> 40:56.960
The Critten Den.

40:56.960 --> 40:57.960
That's a pretty good idea.

40:57.960 --> 40:58.960
I like it.

40:58.960 --> 40:59.960
I think you do kind of have an idea.

40:59.960 --> 41:06.680
I'm at more concept, I mean, that's a great title, but I don't know what I do, like I

41:06.680 --> 41:07.680
just sit and fart.

41:07.680 --> 41:08.680
Ask him.

41:08.680 --> 41:09.680
What do you do as a Crittenden?

41:09.680 --> 41:10.680
That is what I ask him.

41:10.680 --> 41:11.680
Have we gotten that far?

41:11.680 --> 41:12.680
I'm sorry.

41:12.680 --> 41:13.680
All right.

41:13.680 --> 41:14.680
Well, you and me, let's talk.

41:14.680 --> 41:15.680
We can make it happen.

41:15.680 --> 41:16.680
Okay.

41:16.680 --> 41:17.680
Thank you.

41:17.680 --> 41:19.200
If anyone has a good idea, let me know.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.680
I'll do whatever anyone wants me to do.

41:21.680 --> 41:28.320
It's part of the charm, I guess, like, I don't know what charm is.

41:28.320 --> 41:32.440
Someone's been murdered and we're about to find out.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.320
This question is for Spencer.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.840
I am cleaning up today.

41:35.840 --> 41:39.120
Yes, this Q&A should be called, this question is for Spencer.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.000
I'm into it.

41:41.000 --> 41:45.040
That would be the name of the documentary of tonight.

41:45.040 --> 41:46.840
I'm also a Dungeon Master.

41:46.840 --> 41:47.840
Nice.

41:47.840 --> 41:51.520
I have a hard time, like, getting enough material for one day.

41:51.520 --> 41:54.960
How are you able to make material for 20 straight days?

41:54.960 --> 41:59.560
Well, the trick is you only play for five minutes.

41:59.560 --> 42:02.520
With a bunch of people who keep going, what am I doing?

42:02.520 --> 42:03.520
Yeah.

42:03.520 --> 42:10.600
No, I mean, honestly, I've learned to prepare less each week because, you know, if I was

42:10.600 --> 42:15.880
to say, let's plan out five hours, in the first hour, they're going to go into a house.

42:15.880 --> 42:20.320
You know the first thing they're going to do is, like, shit on the house or turn it

42:20.320 --> 42:24.440
into the warp zone or nothing that makes any sense.

42:24.440 --> 42:29.000
So you just plan, like, one seed worth and then you have ideas of where you could go

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
after that.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.520
But, you know, that's what I do.

42:31.520 --> 42:36.360
It's different than preparing for, you know, your typical four hour session or whatever.

42:36.360 --> 42:37.360
Thank you.

42:37.360 --> 42:38.360
Thank you.

42:38.360 --> 42:39.360
Hi.

42:39.360 --> 42:40.360
I'm Jeff.

42:40.360 --> 42:44.720
I want to know, is there going to be a Harmontown tour, too?

42:44.720 --> 42:45.720
Part two.

42:45.720 --> 42:46.720
I don't know.

42:46.720 --> 42:49.000
We'll be making that decision these days, I guess.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.600
I mean, this is certainly exhilarating.

42:50.600 --> 42:53.880
I'm sure there's a lot of people in the audience right now that want to kill themselves, but

42:53.880 --> 43:00.360
I'm having a great time and the seats are full and the movie is well received, so it might

43:00.360 --> 43:02.080
make an obvious choice to, like, go.

43:02.080 --> 43:05.520
I always thought, we'll call the first one Harmontown.

43:05.520 --> 43:08.480
You're looking at me like I'm going to be involved, like, I'm on board.

43:08.480 --> 43:09.480
What am I going to do?

43:09.480 --> 43:10.480
No, no.

43:10.480 --> 43:12.480
Oh, you're, because you're like, I'll be, I'll be doing a documentary.

43:12.480 --> 43:15.320
No, I'm saying, I didn't know you would actually look at me saying, how are we doing

43:15.320 --> 43:16.320
it?

43:16.320 --> 43:19.440
Oh, I, yeah, I, there should be a number, there should be several.

43:19.440 --> 43:20.440
This is a special thing.

43:20.440 --> 43:21.880
It's, I like this, I like this thing.

43:21.880 --> 43:22.880
I like what's going on.

43:22.880 --> 43:23.880
We'll do, we'll do Harmon World.

43:23.880 --> 43:28.160
We'll go to Edinburgh and, like, tell the things that people are always, you know, tweeting

43:28.160 --> 43:32.360
at us, like, how can we never come to such a place worldwide, but whatever, I mean, I

43:32.360 --> 43:33.360
don't know.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.360
Yes.

43:34.360 --> 43:37.360
And then I, I have another question, I'm sorry.

43:37.360 --> 43:38.360
I mean, it's fine.

43:38.360 --> 43:39.360
Go ahead.

43:39.360 --> 43:42.640
It's the president that's been, all this has edited out.

43:42.640 --> 43:45.680
This is all just a Q and A. It's like in a fucking archive.

43:45.680 --> 43:46.680
That's it.

43:46.680 --> 43:48.360
Who is Spencer Crittenden?

43:48.360 --> 43:50.360
Oh, shit.

43:50.360 --> 43:53.880
Who's that question to?

43:53.880 --> 43:54.880
All of you.

43:54.880 --> 43:55.880
Oh, shit.

43:55.880 --> 43:58.680
I think he's Hitler.

43:58.680 --> 44:03.080
Yeah, this is like, this is a long con.

44:03.080 --> 44:04.080
Yeah.

44:04.080 --> 44:07.200
If you, if you get to, if you ask me, I get to answer how I want to answer.

44:07.200 --> 44:08.400
I think he's Hitler.

44:08.400 --> 44:09.400
Hmm.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.400
Hmm.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.400
Bearded Hitler.

44:11.400 --> 44:13.960
I think, I think this is how Hitler started.

44:13.960 --> 44:15.960
Several good points being raised.

44:15.960 --> 44:21.160
I mean, Hitler was like at a Nazi show.

44:21.160 --> 44:24.120
He was like, I could be Dungeon Master.

44:24.120 --> 44:25.120
Yeah.

44:25.120 --> 44:29.640
I'm like, Joe, oh, help fun with you and the thing.

44:29.640 --> 44:30.640
Yeah.

44:30.640 --> 44:31.640
I don't know.

44:31.640 --> 44:34.400
That is a spot on Hitler, by the way.

44:34.400 --> 44:35.400
Thank you.

44:35.400 --> 44:36.400
Here's Hitler.

44:36.400 --> 44:37.640
Here's Hitler as your plumber.

44:37.640 --> 44:43.640
Oh, it seems like you'll have his toilet.

44:43.640 --> 44:47.280
All right.

44:47.280 --> 44:48.280
Thank you.

44:48.280 --> 44:50.640
I'm the last person who knows who I am.

44:50.640 --> 44:51.640
Who are you?

44:51.640 --> 44:52.640
I'm the last person.

44:52.640 --> 44:53.640
Just say it.

44:53.640 --> 44:55.360
What is that?

44:55.360 --> 44:56.360
What does that even mean?

44:56.360 --> 44:57.360
Well, say it.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.200
You know you're thinking like Ewan McGregor.

44:59.200 --> 45:02.200
Who's Ewan McGregor?

45:02.200 --> 45:03.200
Who's Ewan McGregor?

45:03.200 --> 45:04.200
Who's Ewan McGregor?

45:04.200 --> 45:06.200
Are you fucking, fucking me right now?

45:06.200 --> 45:08.200
Is that like Ewan McGregor?

45:08.200 --> 45:09.200
It's, what?

45:09.200 --> 45:10.200
What?

45:10.200 --> 45:11.200
What?

45:11.200 --> 45:12.200
Ewan?

45:12.200 --> 45:13.200
Ewan?

45:13.200 --> 45:15.640
You've seen his name in print and you think his name is Ewan McGregor?

45:15.640 --> 45:17.640
Well, they're brothers, right?

45:17.640 --> 45:18.640
No.

45:18.640 --> 45:21.240
There's Ewan McGregor and he's one person.

45:21.240 --> 45:24.360
I thought it was Ewan and Ewing, like Patrick Ewing?

45:24.360 --> 45:25.360
Ewing McGregor.

45:25.360 --> 45:27.720
He's not, he's doing a bit.

45:27.720 --> 45:28.720
What?

45:28.720 --> 45:29.720
Who's Ewan McGregor?

45:29.720 --> 45:30.720
Who's Ewan McGregor?

45:30.720 --> 45:31.720
Yeah.

45:31.720 --> 45:32.720
He's an actor.

45:32.720 --> 45:34.560
Oh, well, fuck, who cares?

45:34.560 --> 45:35.560
He lies?

45:35.560 --> 45:39.520
A lot of people lie.

45:39.520 --> 45:42.040
You, you really don't know who Ewan McGregor is.

45:42.040 --> 45:43.840
I don't care who actors are.

45:43.840 --> 45:46.800
What's important is the person that they're pretending to be, right?

45:46.800 --> 45:47.800
Not who they are.

45:47.800 --> 45:49.800
Okay, so you like Obi-Wan?

45:49.800 --> 45:50.800
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

45:50.800 --> 45:51.800
Who?

45:51.800 --> 45:52.800
The real person.

45:52.800 --> 45:53.800
Obi-Wan.

45:53.800 --> 45:54.800
Oh, Obi-Wan.

45:54.800 --> 45:55.800
It's from Star Wars.

45:55.800 --> 45:56.800
Obi-Wan.

45:56.800 --> 45:57.800
Obi-Wan, yeah.

45:57.800 --> 45:58.800
I read the novelizations.

45:58.800 --> 45:59.800
I read the novelizations.

45:59.800 --> 46:00.800
See, is all the pronunciations wrong?

46:00.800 --> 46:01.800
That's a great bet.

46:01.800 --> 46:02.800
Are two G2.

46:02.800 --> 46:03.800
That would be, are two.

46:03.800 --> 46:04.800
That is, that would be so funny.

46:04.800 --> 46:05.800
You didn't know how to pronounce R2G2.

46:05.800 --> 46:06.800
Yeah.

46:06.800 --> 46:19.800
It's a, it's a sketch is someone's recounting Star Wars and they've only read the books.

46:19.800 --> 46:24.960
I went to school with a guy, sorry.

46:24.960 --> 46:30.520
I went to school with a guy named R2G2, R2G2 Gonzalez.

46:30.520 --> 46:34.040
His parents named it after their favorite character from the Star Wars movie.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.040
Shut up.

46:35.040 --> 46:36.040
Are you getting out?

46:36.040 --> 46:37.040
Gonzalez, R2G2.

46:37.040 --> 46:38.520
You didn't have a friend named R2G2.

46:38.520 --> 46:39.520
I didn't have a friend.

46:39.520 --> 46:41.720
He went to my school.

46:41.720 --> 46:43.400
His name was R2G2 for real.

46:43.400 --> 46:44.800
R2G2 Gonzalez, yeah.

46:44.800 --> 46:45.800
For real.

46:45.800 --> 46:46.800
Yeah.

46:46.800 --> 46:54.800
I spelled A-R-T-O-O, A-R-T-O-R, I don't know how to spell the D2 part of it, I'm not going

46:54.800 --> 46:55.800
to lie.

46:55.800 --> 46:56.800
I'll just go with R2.

46:56.800 --> 46:57.800
Gonzalez.

46:57.800 --> 46:58.800
Gonzalez.

46:58.800 --> 47:02.800
I'm so excited right now.

47:02.800 --> 47:03.800
Oh, no.

47:03.800 --> 47:04.800
That's R2RO.

47:04.800 --> 47:05.800
Is it R2RO?

47:05.800 --> 47:06.800
Gonzalez?

47:06.800 --> 47:09.240
Well, obviously that's going to have a better Google ranking.

47:09.240 --> 47:11.800
I mean, that's how the search engine works.

47:11.800 --> 47:12.800
R2G2.

47:12.800 --> 47:20.800
You type in R2G2 and it what comes up to Autofill is Dan Harmon Chevy Chase fired NBC.

47:20.800 --> 47:27.800
All right, there is an R2G2, okay, there is a person named R2G2.

47:27.800 --> 47:29.800
Yeah, that's all I'm saying.

47:29.800 --> 47:33.800
It's not that big of a, you know, coincidence.

47:33.800 --> 47:36.800
His last name is Valterra Phenomenon.

47:36.800 --> 47:38.800
All right, so this happens.

47:38.800 --> 47:39.800
It really is.

47:39.800 --> 47:40.800
This is adorable.

47:40.800 --> 47:43.800
This is a young, sexy John Hodgeman.

47:43.800 --> 47:47.800
So this question is for the three of you.

47:47.800 --> 47:51.800
Was there ever a point in time during the tour where a personality's clashed or something

47:51.800 --> 47:55.800
happened where you just wanted to turn it around and stop the thing?

47:55.800 --> 47:56.800
No, no.

47:56.800 --> 47:59.800
That was the weird, the weirdest thing was we left thinking we're going to get tired.

47:59.800 --> 48:00.800
We're going to get bored.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.800
We're going to get over this so soon.

48:02.800 --> 48:04.800
But none of that happened.

48:04.800 --> 48:08.800
Being on a tour bus for 20 days is really, really fun.

48:08.800 --> 48:10.800
You have a good time.

48:10.800 --> 48:11.800
You have the best sleep of your life.

48:11.800 --> 48:12.800
You laugh the whole time.

48:12.800 --> 48:13.800
It's amazing.

48:13.800 --> 48:14.800
Yeah, it was fun.

48:14.800 --> 48:16.800
If Erin were here, I think she would want it on record.

48:16.800 --> 48:18.800
It's like, no, it's fucking miserable.

48:18.800 --> 48:23.800
For a relationship, to get on that, to go into that situation with the person you love

48:23.800 --> 48:29.800
with your life partner, like that is not fair to the relationship.

48:29.800 --> 48:34.800
Every individual can get to choose whether to have a good time on that bus.

48:34.800 --> 48:40.800
But our relationship was definitely just, it was fine.

48:40.800 --> 48:44.800
We survived it, and we knew going in it would be stressful.

48:44.800 --> 48:51.800
But it was like, there's cameras everywhere, and Erin loves documentaries and is really

48:51.800 --> 48:57.800
smart, and is the reason I contacted Neil, because Erin was the one watching Wayne White

48:57.800 --> 48:59.800
in Beauty is Embarrassing.

48:59.800 --> 49:04.800
Erin is the one who's going like, I don't, you know, I just, I want to support you in

49:04.800 --> 49:05.800
your documentary.

49:05.800 --> 49:06.800
I don't want to look bad.

49:06.800 --> 49:08.800
I don't want to do other things.

49:08.800 --> 49:13.800
She's going into it thinking all this stuff, and I'm like, it's just, don't worry about

49:13.800 --> 49:14.800
it.

49:14.800 --> 49:15.800
Let's just have fun.

49:15.800 --> 49:16.800
It was a nightmare.

49:16.800 --> 49:22.800
It was like, you can see the things that reality shows do to crazy people that they cast because

49:22.800 --> 49:26.800
they're crazy, and then they put them on TV, and they go like, oh, there's cameras everywhere,

49:26.800 --> 49:27.800
but just act natural.

49:27.800 --> 49:29.800
They like to watch them unwind.

49:29.800 --> 49:34.800
If you're in a relationship and you go get on a tour bus with cameras everywhere, it'll,

49:34.800 --> 49:38.800
I think it'll, it'll find the nooks and crannies of your, of your relationship.

49:38.800 --> 49:41.800
Yeah, you're going to get a Seaworth subplot.

49:41.800 --> 49:47.800
And it was my fault, because, yeah, I brought work on the bus and all that stuff, but like,

49:47.800 --> 49:52.800
it was actually, because I think like, oh man, that was fun, but Erin's like, it was a nightmare,

49:52.800 --> 49:54.800
and she's right when I look back on it.

49:54.800 --> 49:56.800
It was a nightmare for her.

49:56.800 --> 49:57.800
Thank you.

49:57.800 --> 49:58.800
Thank you.

49:58.800 --> 49:59.800
Hello.

49:59.800 --> 50:01.800
I enjoyed your documentary very much.

50:01.800 --> 50:05.800
I just wanted to ask, during the course of it, I noticed a pervasive use of alcohol,

50:05.800 --> 50:09.800
and I wanted to know how real was that, or were there any…

50:09.800 --> 50:10.800
Have you seen…

50:10.800 --> 50:11.800
That was water.

50:11.800 --> 50:12.800
It was all fake.

50:12.800 --> 50:13.800
How did these water…

50:13.800 --> 50:15.800
Were there any interventions at any point, or…

50:15.800 --> 50:19.800
Have you seen the comically huge bottle that Dan brought on stage?

50:19.800 --> 50:25.800
No, yeah, I drink a lot, and if anyone asks if I'm an alcoholic, I just say yes, because

50:25.800 --> 50:28.800
that makes the conversation stop.

50:28.800 --> 50:30.800
Thank you for your question.

50:30.800 --> 50:33.800
If you say no, then they get to keep talking, so…

50:33.800 --> 50:35.800
I also do the same with racism.

50:35.800 --> 50:37.800
And what happened with the moonshine?

50:37.800 --> 50:39.800
What happened with the moonshine?

50:39.800 --> 50:41.800
Oh my God, he's going to kill us.

50:41.800 --> 50:42.800
Where are you going?

50:42.800 --> 50:43.800
Oh, he's sitting here.

50:43.800 --> 50:44.800
Oh, God.

50:44.800 --> 50:46.800
I thought, because you were like, what happened with the moonshine?

50:46.800 --> 50:48.800
Are you strutted?

50:48.800 --> 50:51.800
I think you saw what happened with the moonshine.

50:51.800 --> 50:53.800
Yeah, the moonshine was a blackout drunk.

50:53.800 --> 50:55.800
I mean, you can hear that podcast.

50:55.800 --> 50:57.800
I did do a lot of edits to that podcast.

50:57.800 --> 51:01.800
There's actually stuff from the movie that I edited out of the podcast, but you can

51:01.800 --> 51:03.800
by and large hear that episode.

51:03.800 --> 51:04.800
It's Nashville.

51:04.800 --> 51:05.800
You can go back and look for it.

51:05.800 --> 51:06.800
That's what happened, yeah.

51:06.800 --> 51:07.800
What you saw was what happened.

51:07.800 --> 51:08.800
It's pretty crazy.

51:08.800 --> 51:11.800
At one point, I took the audience on a bear hunt.

51:11.800 --> 51:13.800
Oh, that got cut out completely.

51:13.800 --> 51:14.800
That was in several edits, but…

51:14.800 --> 51:15.800
Because I regressed to…

51:15.800 --> 51:16.800
Oh, man.

51:16.800 --> 51:18.800
I didn't like that bear hunt.

51:18.800 --> 51:24.800
It was a full-on blackout, crazy warning sign.

51:24.800 --> 51:25.800
Thank you.

51:25.800 --> 51:26.800
You're welcome.

51:26.800 --> 51:27.800
You're welcome.

51:27.800 --> 51:28.800
I mean, it's weird that…

51:28.800 --> 51:29.800
Okay.

51:29.800 --> 51:31.800
How's it going?

51:31.800 --> 51:37.800
I mean, you know, when you say goodbye to a friend and then keep walking to the party.

51:37.800 --> 51:39.800
You go to the party.

51:39.800 --> 51:40.800
Same corner.

51:40.800 --> 51:41.800
I hate that.

51:41.800 --> 51:43.800
Like, I'd rather die than be alive.

51:43.800 --> 51:44.800
Hey, Seek.

51:44.800 --> 51:45.800
It's Seek.

51:45.800 --> 51:46.800
Seek from the podcast.

51:46.800 --> 51:53.800
Multiple aneurysm survivors, Seek.

51:53.800 --> 51:56.800
First of all, Neil, you made an amazing movie.

51:56.800 --> 52:00.800
This is my second time seeing it, and I still got emotional and cried.

52:00.800 --> 52:04.800
And I think you guys represent not only, you know, being honest to the whole movie,

52:04.800 --> 52:06.800
but represent us really well.

52:06.800 --> 52:07.800
And I thank you guys for that.

52:07.800 --> 52:08.800
Thank you, Seek.

52:08.800 --> 52:09.800
Thank you very much.

52:09.800 --> 52:10.800
It's very nice of you to say.

52:10.800 --> 52:11.800
Thank you.

52:11.800 --> 52:14.800
I want to know now that the movie's over and some time has passed.

52:14.800 --> 52:17.800
And they would say, you know, hindsight is 20-20.

52:17.800 --> 52:21.800
Like, is there anything from the movie, like watching it now multiple times with audiences

52:21.800 --> 52:24.800
that you're learning or seeing differently?

52:24.800 --> 52:28.800
Like, Spencer, do you still get depressed even when good things and bad things happen?

52:28.800 --> 52:31.800
Yeah, I'm depressed right now, actually.

52:31.800 --> 52:32.800
It's…

52:32.800 --> 52:34.800
Yeah, I'm going to be fine, you guys.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.800
Also, hire a merch intern.

52:36.800 --> 52:39.800
Like, fucking make someone else deal with that.

52:39.800 --> 52:42.800
I told Aaron over and over again.

52:42.800 --> 52:43.800
Don't do merch.

52:43.800 --> 52:45.800
That was not a lesson you learned.

52:45.800 --> 52:48.800
That was a lesson everyone else but you learned.

52:52.800 --> 52:53.800
Or also, don't do merch.

52:53.800 --> 52:56.800
It's not like that's how Adam Sandler makes his money.

52:56.800 --> 52:58.800
He makes billion-dollar movies that everyone's like,

52:58.800 --> 53:00.800
he doesn't give a shit about t-shirts.

53:00.800 --> 53:03.800
Like, somebody sells a t-shirt with Adam Sandler's face.

53:03.800 --> 53:05.800
It's like, it's bootlegged.

53:05.800 --> 53:08.800
If I can speak for the fans, if I was in another town and you guys came,

53:08.800 --> 53:10.800
that's cool that you guys had merch.

53:10.800 --> 53:12.800
Yeah, hire an intern.

53:12.800 --> 53:14.800
I'm going to be high-roaded.

53:14.800 --> 53:18.800
Wait, there were 7,000 t-shirts.

53:18.800 --> 53:21.800
The amount of merch was unbelievable.

53:21.800 --> 53:23.800
Like, there's one shot of it in the beginning

53:23.800 --> 53:25.800
where there's lines of garbage bags.

53:25.800 --> 53:26.800
Those are filled with t-shirts.

53:26.800 --> 53:27.800
And we sold all of it.

53:27.800 --> 53:28.800
No, we did not.

53:28.800 --> 53:29.800
I know.

53:29.800 --> 53:31.800
We didn't sell like half of it.

53:31.800 --> 53:34.800
Get your Harmon Down t-shirt.

53:34.800 --> 53:37.800
I want everyone listening to me to understand something about t-shirts.

53:37.800 --> 53:39.800
They're very easy to print.

53:39.800 --> 53:41.800
They're very easy to sell.

53:41.800 --> 53:43.800
Everyone can always use them.

53:43.800 --> 53:47.800
They're a fantastic way to communicate, to express yourself,

53:47.800 --> 53:49.800
to exchange in commerce.

53:49.800 --> 53:52.800
The amount of money you make on t-shirts

53:52.800 --> 53:56.800
will always just give you enough money to make more t-shirts.

53:56.800 --> 53:59.800
There is nothing, there isn't anyone out there right now

53:59.800 --> 54:02.800
who's like, and then I got the t-shirt business.

54:02.800 --> 54:05.800
There's no Howard Hughes of t-shirtery.

54:05.800 --> 54:08.800
Well, other than our friend Ryan Ridley who lived off of a t-shirt

54:08.800 --> 54:11.800
from two years. That was a different era, yes.

54:11.800 --> 54:13.800
There was a company that, yeah.

54:13.800 --> 54:16.800
And if I could just say last, like Dan,

54:16.800 --> 54:18.800
hopefully you don't still see yourself as the villain

54:18.800 --> 54:21.800
because I know a lot of us here, you're a hero to us.

54:21.800 --> 54:22.800
So thank you guys for being here.

54:22.800 --> 54:23.800
You son of a bitch.

54:23.800 --> 54:27.800
You son of a bitch, Seek!

54:27.800 --> 54:29.800
You can't argue with him.

54:29.800 --> 54:31.800
He listened to the podcast.

54:31.800 --> 54:33.800
Seek keeps reporting in.

54:33.800 --> 54:36.800
He's survived multiple aneurysms.

54:36.800 --> 54:40.800
Like, in a world where one is bad,

54:40.800 --> 54:45.800
he just has them and comes up and reports into us

54:45.800 --> 54:48.800
from the edge of existence.

54:48.800 --> 54:52.800
And he's a visual artist who had his visual memory wiped out

54:52.800 --> 54:56.800
by some of these things and is retraining his brain to see things.

54:56.800 --> 54:59.800
It's very cool. You should watch the podcast.

54:59.800 --> 55:02.800
Listen to it.

55:02.800 --> 55:06.800
That was for the three people who walked into the Vista tonight.

55:06.800 --> 55:08.800
What's your movie, Martha?

55:08.800 --> 55:11.800
They're like skeleton twins and weird.

55:11.800 --> 55:13.800
Bill Hader is not in this at all.

55:13.800 --> 55:16.800
Why am I plugging? I'm plugging Seek.

55:16.800 --> 55:18.800
You know who Seek is.

55:18.800 --> 55:21.800
Kristen Wiig looks different.

55:21.800 --> 55:23.800
I've been trying to get...

55:23.800 --> 55:26.800
I want to get Rob Schrab up here, but he just fucking left.

55:26.800 --> 55:30.800
The only time he's dropping you at home right now...

55:30.800 --> 55:34.800
Yeah. He reversed Schraub me.

55:34.800 --> 55:37.800
He's probably getting popcorn or something.

55:37.800 --> 55:39.800
Should we call that the Q&A?

55:39.800 --> 55:40.800
Yes.

55:40.800 --> 55:44.800
And then we'll do a little title sequence for a very short Harmontown.

55:44.800 --> 55:45.800
Yeah, let's do it.

55:45.800 --> 55:46.800
And then we can decide on editing videos.

55:46.800 --> 55:48.800
Oh, look who walked back in.

55:48.800 --> 55:50.800
All right, let's do it.

55:50.800 --> 55:52.800
Thanks, Neil Berkeley, for directing that movie.

55:52.800 --> 55:55.800
Thank you. I made the movie for you. Thank you.

55:55.800 --> 55:58.800
No, don't do that.

55:58.800 --> 56:00.800
When does the podcast start?

56:00.800 --> 56:02.800
Motherfucker.

56:02.800 --> 56:04.800
You motherfucker.

56:04.800 --> 56:06.800
Schraub.

56:06.800 --> 56:08.800
How did...

56:08.800 --> 56:10.800
Is the universe helping you?

56:10.800 --> 56:11.800
How did you know?

56:11.800 --> 56:13.800
Is God on your side?

56:13.800 --> 56:16.800
How did you know the timing that that's what we were talking about?

56:16.800 --> 56:17.800
I had no idea.

56:17.800 --> 56:18.800
You opened the door.

56:18.800 --> 56:22.800
You ran in as he started saying we're going to start the podcast.

56:22.800 --> 56:25.800
You come up to the microphone and you do a live Schraub.

56:25.800 --> 56:27.800
The nose nose.

56:27.800 --> 56:29.800
We're live Schraubing right now.

56:29.800 --> 56:31.800
All right, I'm going to introduce you.

56:31.800 --> 56:33.800
My Uber is like...

56:33.800 --> 56:35.800
No, it's a $10 penalty.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.800
Don't we want him on the podcast? It would be great.

56:37.800 --> 56:38.800
You don't have to do this.

56:38.800 --> 56:41.800
Go get your Uber driver. Bring him in here too.

56:41.800 --> 56:42.800
Is that okay?

56:42.800 --> 56:43.800
Yes.

56:43.800 --> 56:44.800
Okay, I'll go get him.

56:44.800 --> 56:46.800
All right, I'm going to do an intro.

56:46.800 --> 56:48.800
I'll crouch down and...

56:48.800 --> 56:51.800
All right, we'll just start from scratch.

56:51.800 --> 56:53.800
Ladies and gentlemen,

56:53.800 --> 56:59.800
I'm your guest comptroller, Kumail Nanjiani. Harmontown is now in session.

56:59.800 --> 57:06.800
Please welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

57:06.800 --> 57:10.800
Wow, thank you, Los Angeles. Thank you.

57:10.800 --> 57:12.800
Boy, we had a Q&A.

57:12.800 --> 57:14.800
Maybe you heard it. Maybe you didn't.

57:14.800 --> 57:16.800
We're not sure what we're doing.

57:16.800 --> 57:19.800
It's a city of lights, a city of magic, a city of industry.

57:19.800 --> 57:22.800
This is where the splicing and the shooting and the production happens.

57:22.800 --> 57:26.800
Sometimes you're present for the production of things.

57:26.800 --> 57:28.800
Dreams are made here.

57:28.800 --> 57:32.800
Yeah, they're manufactured here by the Katzenbergs and the Zemeckises,

57:32.800 --> 57:38.800
and they're shuttled out through pneumatic tubes to the rest of the country

57:38.800 --> 57:43.800
so that America can continue its dream of hegemony.

57:43.800 --> 57:51.800
It's a culture war, and if you're listening, you've lost.

57:51.800 --> 57:54.800
We're here in the Pentagon of that culture war.

57:54.800 --> 57:56.800
The Vista Theater in Los Feliz,

57:56.800 --> 58:00.800
where a lot of you saw your first movies when you came to LA.

58:00.800 --> 58:02.800
I do love this theater.

58:02.800 --> 58:04.800
A lot of people come in here and they go,

58:04.800 --> 58:06.800
I saw Reservoir Dogs here.

58:06.800 --> 58:10.800
Everyone has some kind of story about a movie theater.

58:10.800 --> 58:15.800
I wonder what formative movie Spencer's eight years old.

58:15.800 --> 58:17.800
He doesn't know what we're talking about.

58:17.800 --> 58:19.800
I'm also on the podcast.

58:19.800 --> 58:22.800
Oh, Spencer's here, yeah, yeah, sorry.

58:22.800 --> 58:24.800
God damn it.

58:24.800 --> 58:27.800
Well, yeah, the listeners won't know.

58:27.800 --> 58:29.800
Well, I mean they will now, but...

58:29.800 --> 58:30.800
We don't know what we're doing.

58:30.800 --> 58:31.800
We don't know what we're doing.

58:31.800 --> 58:33.800
I know what I'm doing.

58:33.800 --> 58:35.800
Tap dancing.

58:35.800 --> 58:37.800
Holy shit, look at him go!

58:37.800 --> 58:39.800
The carpet's too soft, you can't hear it.

58:39.800 --> 58:41.800
Oh my god, wow!

58:41.800 --> 58:43.800
Holy shit, he's so nimble.

58:43.800 --> 58:44.800
It's impressive, I know.

58:44.800 --> 58:46.800
Well, why is that helicopter coming in?

58:46.800 --> 58:48.800
He's part of it.

58:48.800 --> 58:50.800
Is that the helicopter?

58:50.800 --> 58:52.800
Or is that you sucking noodles?

58:52.800 --> 58:55.800
That's me eating noodles from the helicopter.

58:55.800 --> 58:57.800
The helicopter's coming in with all kinds of shit.

58:57.800 --> 59:01.800
Oh my god, look what is happening.

59:01.800 --> 59:02.800
Rob, come here.

59:02.800 --> 59:04.800
Okay.

59:04.800 --> 59:07.800
Rob, Rob is here.

59:07.800 --> 59:09.800
Rob's coming in with his Uber driver.

59:09.800 --> 59:11.800
Come here.

59:11.800 --> 59:15.800
Alright, so earlier Rob said he had to leave with his Uber.

59:15.800 --> 59:18.800
This is RJ, RJ, RJ microphone.

59:18.800 --> 59:22.800
RJ, have a seat please.

59:22.800 --> 59:24.800
Question number one.

59:24.800 --> 59:25.800
Have a seat.

59:25.800 --> 59:28.800
Question, is this the weirdest Uber ride you've ever given?

59:28.800 --> 59:29.800
Yes.

59:29.800 --> 59:30.800
Great.

59:30.800 --> 59:34.800
RJ.

59:34.800 --> 59:36.800
So why couldn't wait?

59:36.800 --> 59:39.800
He was going to take me home to feed my dog, so...

59:39.800 --> 59:41.800
Your dog's fine.

59:41.800 --> 59:47.800
So Rob was leaving and we convinced him to come back in and bring his Uber driver.

59:47.800 --> 59:49.800
And that's you?

59:49.800 --> 59:50.800
Yes.

59:50.800 --> 59:52.800
So we have Uber questions.

59:52.800 --> 59:54.800
Oh no.

59:54.800 --> 59:56.800
Don't do that.

59:56.800 --> 59:58.800
He's being nice enough.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.800
Are you uncomfortable up here?

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.800
If you don't want to be up here, you can totally leave.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.800
Can I go?

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:08.800
I'm sure he's used to being on stage in front of hundreds of people.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.800
Yes.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:15.800
Is it RJ the letters or is it spelled RJ?

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.800
Like R2D2.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.800
Were you here for that?

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.800
No, I was here for that.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.800
That's when I went, I got to get the fuck out of here.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.800
Alright, let RJ answer.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.800
It's spelled A-R-J-E-I.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.800
A-R-G-J-E-I.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.800
What nationality is that?

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.800
Filipino.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.800
There's some Pinoy's in the house.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:40.800
Canolis?

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.800
What did you call them?

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.800
That doesn't sound right.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.800
Yeah, I'm really bad at racism, these fucking Pinoy's.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.800
What did you say?

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:50.800
Pinoy, right?

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.800
It's a slang for Filipino.

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:56.800
Okay, I have Pinoy friends.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.800
What?

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.800
Why did you call them?

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.800
You heard me.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.800
That's a hard why you can't say it like that.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:11.800
You just only read the novelization of races?

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.800
I'm doing all these callbacks to jokes that these guys did.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.800
I'm sorry, RJ.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:16.800
Don't worry about it.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.800
RJ, you sound like a sexy news anchor,

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:20.800
in spite of being Filipino.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:21.800
Are you second generation?

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.800
Are your parents from the Philippines?

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:24.800
Yes.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.800
Okay, so is English your second language?

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.800
Yeah.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.800
Okay, so when you speak to your parents,

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.800
what language do you speak?

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.800
A little bit of both.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:35.800
What's the other one?

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:36.800
I'm trying to like...

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.800
What's the other one?

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:38.800
I don't know what this is.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:39.800
Tagalog?

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:40.800
What is it?

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:41.800
Tagalog.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:42.800
Oh, Tagalog, T-A-G-A.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.800
Tagalog.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.800
Yeah, that's how most Americans would say it.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.800
What's the biggest movie star in your country?

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:55.800
What the fuck?

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.800
I have no idea.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.800
Okay.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:01:59.800
What's the biggest line?

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:00.800
It's a great answer.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:01.800
It's a great answer.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.800
What's that?

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.800
Oh, yeah.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:04.800

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.800
Box.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:08.800
He's a boxer.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.800
He punches.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.800
Okay.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.800
Star of event.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:12.800

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:14.800
Does he sell things?

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:21.800
You missed that part.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.800
Yeah.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.880
when you're in English having a fight with your

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:21.120
Significant other there's certain words that when they're happy this like all right now

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.840
It's gonna take a little bit for us to get past this it's

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:32.360
For you game of thrones spoilers. Yeah game of thrones for like it would like the C word

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:36.800
You know you throw that out there. That's a big one now. You got a like backtrack and stuff

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:43.680
What's the one that if you're in a fight with a lady from the Philippines the word you say and it's like oh, no

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.680
I I fucked up

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.320
It's shit no pretty mild

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.680
Or just another one more intense

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.080
Allul

01:07:58.080 --> 01:07:59.520
What is it?

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:06.280
What is it elegant? It's you lol allul. Yeah, what is up? No, no, no, let's guess play the game

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.520
That's definitely exactly what that is

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:15.360
Um, let's see like an overly circular dish

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.280
It's too circular

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.600
A flat clitoris

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.680
The biggest crime of all

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.680
I

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:42.200
Know what you are well, you know what you are I

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.360
Like the hand gesture

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:53.040
That is not true that is not true. You might as three-dimensional as it's bulbous

01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:01.040
I better get a water bottle on the way home here, okay good. No, he's thinking. Yeah

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:06.960
You should get a water bottle. I should drive you home. This is an instant five stars at least you plug it in your thing

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.480
As we went to Santa Monica three times. Yeah

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.240
Obviously, we'll give you five stars both ways of course

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:19.840
Obviously, it's simply it's just it's simply just a woman's

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:26.000
Private parts. That's it. There's no nuance to it at all. No, it's shaking his head. Okay. It's not okay

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.360
It's a guy who was born from an asshole. Oh

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:43.720
That's probably the closest thing to it. Oh really? I'm on fire. I should have been a dollar over that

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:50.360
So what is it? What is it? No, it's just not really sure you but

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.680
It's just like

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.600
I think it's you really really really really really stupid

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:03.840
I got yeah, but it's but it's but it's that for you. That is closest to a guy born from an asshole

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:11.040
But it's a second you're an oath. You're a you're a you're an asshole. You're almost equivalent to that

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:17.000
But it's interesting in your in your parents language like that is

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.760
Like approaching the seaward like it's really like if you said that when you were a kid

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.640
Your mom would slap you and go don't say I actually got spanked for that

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:30.480
Yeah, cuz you said it your sister or something what what was the circumstance that made you say that in front of your mother

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.920
It wasn't my mom. Oh

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:35.880
Okay, man

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:43.800
Was she being a what you said? No, no, no, I just said it out of a unique expression. Oh, okay

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.200
It sounds kind of beautiful

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:51.960
It's not it's like there's no consumments. It sounds like music. Oh, there's

01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:00.320
In Urdu, that's the language you see in Pakistan

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Ulu is a

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:09.320
It means stupid and we called and I bet they're related because we're pretty close to each other geographically

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:18.080
Ulu means someone stupid, but it's also the word for owl which hero considered smart. I don't have a thing to combine those but

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.360
Aren't we all different in wonderful ways?

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:30.480
Well in here's something in America a fanny is your butt, but in England. It's your vagina. Yeah

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.840
Yep, and a friend of my wife's

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.600
Had this this stuff called fanny cream

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:43.120
It's supposed to tighten your fanny or whatever which

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:50.600
Supposed to be it's an American fanny, but her her British friends came over and said

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.560
How weird why do you have tightening?

01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:02.320
Fanny cream and oh, it's just tightening your butt. That's normal. I get it now

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:06.080
Why would anyone want to teach me how much that's way more normal?

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:13.080
Yeah, why are they tightening? Oh, no, I heard the second hand. Don't ask for details, man

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.240
You're being a real old. Yeah

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:20.320
Admitted do you have you gone back RJ? Do you I mean not back?

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.640
But have you been have you visited the Philippines? No for 20 years

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:30.920
How old are you can ask you seem kind of young 33. Oh, okay, so you went when you were 13. You're my age

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:36.840
Don't laugh that quick. Don't laugh that quick. Are your parents here in the States here?

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:43.120
So you haven't been in the homeland for 20 years. He said pretty much

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:49.560
Do you like candles, I don't know

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:55.080
I don't know. I like how thoughtful we're like, what would NPR ask you? I

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.280
Had Filipino food once

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.280
And I

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:09.160
Went to Jollybee's a Filipino place, right, but I didn't go there really have you been there really?

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:15.800
No, it's kind of good. Isn't it? Well, this was it's fine. I went to a place and I got I was like

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:22.840
It wasn't Jollybee was just and I was like, oh, I'll get this and it was what it was was it was a purple soup with bones in it

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:27.200

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.360
Monkey Prince

Exotic exotic food. Did you eat the did you eat the bones and throw out the soup?

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.680

Yeah, you got purple. It was a purple liquid with bones in it. Do you know what that's called?

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:51.000
I don't know what you're talking about. You know what? I bet they were like fuck this guy. Yeah

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:02.760
So your whole family's over here now all in LA yeah, LA LA yeah, how long have you been ubering a

Well, how many podcasts have you done?

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.480
Let us see

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:16.920
Like when I tapped on the window and I said hey

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.920
Do you mind coming in for a second? There's a little show going in and I opened the door

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:28.400
There's all these people and I I remember you saying oh

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.160
This again

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.600
One of these hey

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:43.160
Yeah, I just dropped Marc Maron off at Andy Daley's house today. I guess this is my life

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:47.480
What I'm saying is you're being an incredibly amazing sport. Thank you so much. Thank you

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:58.040
RJ what's your favorite episode of community?

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:07.800
Do you and know who any of do you have any idea what's going on here? There's no shame in that

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:11.760
There's no shame in that you know a show called community and NBC

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:16.240
Mm-hmm. There's no shame in that you rack every here parts in rec

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.960
Brooklyn 99

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:28.600
What shows you the Seinfeld that's uplifting walking dead. Okay. Oh, it's a classic

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.080
Do you watch worth in black?

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.520
No

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:42.000
Well, you should I don't even know I haven't seen America all the writers won't shut up about it. I haven't seen orphan black

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:46.960
What's your what's been your worst uber experience other than this one?

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:54.200
Seriously, have you had like a bad one? What makes you give a guy a low rating? Yeah, yeah, we know you

01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:03.560
Yeah, that's the question. Why do I have a 4.8? Why not five when I have only ever given all of you a five?

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:08.840
Why do I love 4.5? Yeah, all of you. It's not a race. They're uber drivers

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:15.400
It's not a race. Has there ever been a night where you were just like you need to get the fuck out

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:20.760
All right, let them just you need to get out. Let him answer you need to get it out

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:27.600
No, you need to get out. I like I'm staying you need to get out

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.400
Now no

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.480
No

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:38.640
My favorite part is that you're looking into the rear view mirror when you're doing that. Yeah, that is great object work

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:46.480
You need to get out. He gots to go. Um, have you got to kick anyone out?

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.240
I haven't had a bad experience yet. All right, what what's the lowest rate you give?

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:57.200
Passengers ratings. I have a 4.8. Why do you think I don't even know I have a 4.7 rating

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.320
I don't know why let's change that tonight. Do you do you give passengers fives like all the time?

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:09.640
Yeah, yeah, have you ever given not a five to anybody? No, no, yeah, never. I figure how do you feel that that like

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.160
undermines the whole concept of a star rating system because

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:18.320
If fives are the only one that anyone's choosing it's kind of like you're just choosing zeros

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.040
Well

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:28.480
All all businesses have this problem. It's a real issue where you have to give them one of the top businesses

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:34.280
That have this problem, you know, I'd say Apple Incorporated does a really good job with it

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:40.160
But you know for instance borders tried it for a while. You saw how that goes Barnes and Noble didn't as it happens

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:45.320
Well, Apple Apple's doing so good. How come you because they don't focus on only the 9s and 10s

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:48.160
That's what everyone does. They're like if it's a 9 or 10, it's fine

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:53.620
Otherwise, you're fired and that's not constructive because sometimes you only get a C and that's great

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.720
What are you supposed to do look at the

01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:02.760
The fives and go like you look at the threes and you go like oh these guys what went wrong and then you fix it

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.680
me I'll be on the

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:11.440
But also like you you worked under that regime and now you work now you you left them you bailed

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:14.200
Uh-huh, I waved a dollar in your face

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:21.600
And you were like fuck this Apple business. Uh-huh Steve Jobs. Yeah, he used to work at Apple

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.880
I used to work at Apple works with Dan

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.880
Sorry

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:31.320
We're leaving RJ out. Sorry. Sorry RJ. Is this the worst of the best pockets episode? Okay. All right

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:38.880
But let's I just want to make sure we really really kick it into RJ. Do you believe in God?

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.760
Yes

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:46.280
What do you what do you think God is like do you think it's like do you think it was it would be something that you

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:53.400
Could see or do you is God personal to you or do you believe in a God that you think is like able to like

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:59.320
Do you do you think that God is the same from one person to the next or do you think God is personal to you?

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:09.640
You can take as long as you want for truthfully that's not supposed to be an instant answer. No, he gets paid by the

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:13.280
He can't take the as long as he wants

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:17.240
For this right is the meter running

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:24.120
Yes, the meter is running. I said I haven't started. Yeah, no, no, you're starting. It started. You'll do please

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:30.320
Like you can think as long as you want and then start the meter I

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:37.320
Guess it's personal to me. Yeah, like it's between you and the unknown

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.800
All right, that's the right answer. I can see

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:48.400
I'm sorry, you're right. I feel like people should understand that religion is like it's like a thing

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.040
It's like it's not it's not other people's business. It should have a small case are

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.280
But not to mean that it's not important. It's the most important thing in the world

01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:01.000
It's like shoes or pants. You don't fucking wear pants that fit other people. No

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.840
You pick and shoes

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:12.040
Same with shoes. You don't wear shoes. We have been trained in our society to think that religion is somehow

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.920
the domain of idiots

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.880
fundamentalists people who

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:23.680
Decided things and if we think about religion we decide things about ourselves and we have to pick something

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:29.440
Like we don't we we sit and we talk about this TV shows good, but I only like this part

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.760
I like the Shakira song, but I only like the bridge and I actually think I like her influence on this and we we pick

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:40.800
And choose we mythologize our consumption about everything except for the most important thing in the world to primates since

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.360
Thunder clapped and lightning hit our monkey friend religion

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:49.320
Why do we die? Why does the universe not give a fuck about us?

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:54.960
It's like an important thing and we let me and we let it sit and we got like well my parents were Lutheran

01:20:54.960 --> 01:21:01.640
So I guess don't give a fuck about that. It's religion. It's like one man's business between you and the unknown

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.520
God damn it. I'm great

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.360
I wish the wind is the world gonna catch up I

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:17.640
Think look at all these people here. No, they're all right

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:22.960
They're good people. Yeah, I just want to make this a good podcast

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:27.080
I'm gonna go beyond that. That was an easy shot

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.520
Has anyone in the room ever stolen anything? Oh

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.120
RJ has

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:42.680
Okay, let's start with RJ. Let's start with RJ. Are you are you are you willing to talk about it?

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:45.280
What do you stole something? What do you steal?

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:52.520
You don't have to talk. You're not gonna get caught. How many arches could there be running uber in Los Feliz?

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:58.600
Thanks, it's still money for my parents. Oh, that's fine. I did that too. Yeah

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:05.120
No one's gonna press charges just like out of their purses and wallets and stuff. No eat like mug. Yeah

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.880
To get what like son

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:17.760
What did you need so bad? I remember the one is all stickers and like just the most random shit

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:22.360
Like what did you need so bad that you would go into your parents room and like I was just mad at them

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:27.120
So I try to get back at them by stealing money. Well, you did what did you buy with a cigarette sir?

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:31.200
What food? Oh food revenge is what he bought

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:34.960
Now the revenge was free

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:42.240
Haha, who's who's got who's who who stole something that they think is genuinely

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:46.200
Yeah, what what I like is that this dude's raising his hand and the guy next to him is pointing at

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:51.120
He's like believe me. I've heard about this. He stole it for me. I know it was great

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.640
Would you would you come up and tell us about the thing you stole?

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.200
You didn't feel it from the gentleman, right? I

01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:04.120
Stole a baby. It's for someone here. Oh shit. Okay. It's the guy next to me

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.120
He's like he's my life force

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:11.320
So I'm a huge community fan, I'm a huge community fan

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:20.160
And I was lucky enough to find myself with unsupervised access to what yeah to to the set one day and so

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:29.560
To take advantage of that or to show my thanks for that I took a community pendant off the wall

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.440
and at some point

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:38.600
further on at Channel 101 I had you sign it and and got it okayed with you that I had taken it

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:43.780
It's like a poster on the wall or it was a pendant. It's what's a pendant. It's like the triangle flag

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:52.760
Sorry, okay. All right. Yeah, and it has the old community logo with the flag draped without wings

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:56.200
That's cool. Yeah, pretty sure a prop guy was fired for losing

01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:03.000
No, I would say I two years ago. I would be like you did what to my sacred temple

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:09.240
But then like like every I found out every season Sony just fucking shovels that shit into an incinerator

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:17.000
So we got to make room for the good wife for Shark Tank or whatever like they're like that's gonna cost eight dollars to store this

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:23.200
We don't let's get rid of these frogs some breros and shit that I would have I would have fucking taken

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:31.760
Everything everything what that's British shoe from the British shoe episode. I know we burnt that that was worth more as ash

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.200
We powered a train

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.080
Filled with Whitney Houston's greatest hits

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:43.200
After her death, we needed to get those to the record store really quickly

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:49.120
So we set fire to your set in the furnace on the Sony train

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:57.320
It's a you everything you did everything you dedicated your life to it's more valuable. It's steam

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:01.600
So good job getting that pendant out of there

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:06.080
I'm just glad I stole the Troy and Abed dolls from the Christmas episode

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:10.680
I'm scondid with those the other ones are melting into the second

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:13.520
sidewalk somewhere Sony train somewhere

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:20.360
Anybody else told something big crazy still stole something weird. There's a hand weighing back

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:24.160
Why don't we reward it is it an intense thing? Yeah, come on up

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:29.840

01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:57.820

What do they give you $70 you just made $140 we'll talk about it. Yeah, we'll talk around space

01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:13.020
I'm gonna make up a new product

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.500
I'm on board for it

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:19.380
You could just get the mic out of that. Yeah, there you go

01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:26.100
Okay, first. Let me justify it by saying I was a lot younger and I was homeless

01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:29.340
But I used to go

01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:37.260
Oh, like about 19 18 we're all agreeing in advance to reward your candor because we asked you to tell us about something

01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:42.020
You stole we're not we're not asking you to tell us about something. You're proud of like so if this is shameful

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:44.180
We we love it all the more

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:53.020
I used to go to bars with a fake ID and I'd steal women's purses and then take them to the bathroom and

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:56.000
Take their wallets out and take their money

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.200
That's a pretty real one. That's not a pennant off a wall

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:13.000
You were at a stage in your life when you were homeless and you were going to bar and so you were just this is how you were living

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.980
You were going to bars and you would just go, you know what would you would you I'm curious about this

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:23.640
Would you pick and choose who you would victimize? Would you go that that person deserves?

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:27.720
Everyone if you try to engage them in conversation like what do you how do you feel about black people?

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.720
Taking your wallet

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:42.480
All right, so you did there was a sense of karmic like justice in your head

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:55.280
Well, yes, there was that but but having decided that you were going to do that carnivorously you then also the human achievement is that

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:58.480
Whereas a fox would just eat a fucking baby good gazelle

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:06.000
Like it wouldn't go like oh that gazelle deserves this it's got a gazelle's racist like like when humans cannibalize each other

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.880
We still have this compulsion to go. Oh this person deserves it

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:15.040
You know like prisoners get so excited about pedophiles wait. You're a pedophile. I get to rape you

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:21.640
I'm so excited about rape now. I got a reason. Oh boy

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.120
Yeah, that's exactly right actually

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:32.040
What was your biggest haul? What was the most money you ever got out of a purse?

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:39.840
$500 did you ever get caught or get it get close to being caught?

01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:44.080
Sounds like you're pretty thorough about a pretty profession

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:49.640
What awesome a lot of things, but that was probably the worst

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:52.080
I've stolen like from parties and

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:56.680
Like stores and stuff, but that was like the most personal

01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:04.240
It seems like if you're you're you're willing to share this it seems like maybe you're like this was a transition in your life

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.520
You were I definitely I got my karma. I mean oh

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:13.600
What what happened for the podcast listeners? She's she's rolled down the aisle in a wheelchair

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:15.880
She's sharing this I didn't think to share this

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:24.760
What what do you mean you get sick? I got a rare illness called Ehlers-Danlos and

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:29.000
My joints dislocate as I try and walk

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:33.760
So now I have to use a wheelchair and you look back on it and think oh well

01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:36.440
I was a bad person. I deserve this which you probably shouldn't

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:43.520
No, I don't not that much but if a karma if there is really karma, I mean that's that's nice of you

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:46.880
To take that responsibility to do that

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:49.440
I think that there's probably people in the room who

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.920
Who don't end up suffering misfortune who probably did a lot of shitty stuff much worth things

01:29:54.920 --> 01:30:01.400
I mean, I don't know if it's helpful for you to like think that like random stuff can happen to you

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:04.760
Yeah, it doesn't have to have to do with whether or not you're a good or bad person

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:10.920
It's like that might that might that might not be helpful to you, but I mean, it's it's a

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.080
like

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:20.240
Like I have like a million questions for you. Like you you so you wait. Why were you homeless? Like what was there?

01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:24.520
I was really rebellious and I

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:31.840
Ran away from home a lot when I was a teenager and where did you live if we can ask that we're in the country

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:33.760
California California

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:39.240
And my parents just cut the stick of it and they were showing me tough love and they weren't letting me come back

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:41.560
Right. How old were you at that point?

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:45.120
Yeah, I remember my brother like

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:51.800
Tangled with drugs and stuff is just smoking weed and stuff and my parents were like, ah, you need help like sometimes

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:58.880
Yeah, parents are trying to like they don't know how to be parents and they're like, ah, you get you're you're a fuck-up kid

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:01.400
Like I'm being a bad parent. So now you're gonna

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.400
I

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:05.960
Connected with them

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.640
Okay, oh, yeah, your parents live in California

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.960
What's a what is this condition? I don't I've never heard of it

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:21.160
It's a connective tissue disorder. It's hereditary. So like my collagen instead of it being like rubber bands

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.280
It's kind of like loose noodles

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:30.040
So like all my tendons and like my like everywhere, but it's not as stretchy

01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:37.680
No, it's over over stretch. Well, it's just like it's wobbly. It's like wibbly wobbly. It's just gone

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:41.960
Like the there's stuff in your body that keeps it like if you were to go

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:47.040
It's over there and you pointed too hard your arm couldn't like fly out of your socket and

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:51.840
like if I lift like a carton of milk my wrist will dislocate and

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:59.360
And and you find out about this at what age? I was like 27, but I got like

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.200
five or six different wrong

01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:03.960
diagnosis

01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:10.680
I've been trying for seven years to get a diagnosis for it. So and when did you land on this diagnosis?

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:12.840
How recently was two years ago two years?

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:20.480
It's really it's it's not that rare, but people don't get diagnosed properly

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:25.040
So there's a lot of people who actually because what's happening at first when people go to the doctor?

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:30.400
What are that would not to inspire people as a new podcast to go? Oh my god? I have this which is what I will do

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:33.120
Yeah, well first it was just a

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:42.640
Joint pain and like dislocations and then like a bunch of other stuff started happening and how quickly was that?

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:54.920
Well, I think a lot of us are walking around with a lot of shitty stuff. We did I don't know not to beat a dead horse

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:58.960
But I definitely don't think that you should think that it had anything to do with

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:04.520
Anything that you've done. I don't think it's direct karma for what I did

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:06.120
Yeah

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:09.040
But also at the same time you're like, okay

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:16.160
I have a personal relationship with a with with something and you're like, yeah, you kind of balance to get out in your head

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.400
What's your name? Can we ask?

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:26.520
Yeah, okay, that's fine. Yeah, they're gonna be like it's someone else who has this disease

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.800
Used to go to bars. I think that might be Steve

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:38.480
I've already since there's not really anybody else that my friends would know that have this but yeah, my name's

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:46.120
Oh, okay. Well, thank you Krista for sharing. We really appreciate that. That's what I wanted. I wanted you you help me

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.440
You make my podcast amazing

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:51.240
That's all I care about

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.200
It's all I care about

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:58.120
I suck your humanity out of your bodies. That's all I care about

01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:03.480
It's a good podcast now. I think this is how you get less than a five-star rating

01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:09.920
Thank you, Krista, that was really touching. I was yeah, I hope the sound I hope the sound mixing works

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:13.000
Dustin are you gonna make sure that that yeah, does that sound good?

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:17.440
How would you know you had headphones on during the whole thing?

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:21.000
I really like that. I don't know. I like that

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.640
Yeah, I like that a lot my joke

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:28.400
No, not your joke. I don't like anything about you

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:37.760
Is it weird for you guys to see yourself on screen and talk about the period where you guys weren't talking?

01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:41.040
No, not for me because I feel vindicated

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:49.320
Like the story is about like some thing published Sarah Silverman show like with what six episodes I

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:51.320
I

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:54.800
regret asking

01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:04.960
Like obviously, you know, come on you measure a man by how many documentaries are made after him

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.720
So Hitler is the greatest man of all time. Yeah

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.600
And the Beatles

01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:17.880
No, I I mean I like I when Schrab and I

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:21.480
I like when Sarah fired me I

01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:24.400
Was probably like at that point

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:29.040
Not probably it was the word. It was like my worst nightmare scenario

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:34.360
I remember being so angry and I knew I had nowhere to put the anger. I had no

01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:39.920
It didn't I would tell people like the people that I dated, you know

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:45.040
Who in whom I would confide it would be like I'm telling you this thing that is making me very upset

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:49.560
And I know that I don't have any right. I can't tell anyone about this

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:55.560
I can't tell anyone how angry I'm about this because I will sound like the most petty piece of shit in the world

01:35:55.560 --> 01:36:01.880
And I can't I can't admit to myself that that I I wish Rob Schrab

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.920
less luck

01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:11.560
Than he deserves I can't tell him I can't I can't express the fact that I wish

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:15.920
That the Sarah Silverman program would fail without me, you know

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.480
I have these petty golem-like thoughts

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:26.160
About my precious and I can't express them like and then that makes it worse and worse and it festers and all that stuff

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:31.560
And I so it was a year of because I couldn't express those things because I knew they were unhealthy

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:37.920
Like Rob and I didn't talk to each other for like a year at all and then this guy Mike Ash died

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:39.960
comedies

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:44.680
comedy channel 101 Mike Ash, he was an old timer who

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.560
Did a bunch of channel 101 stuff and he

01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:55.120
He he died and it was at his memorial service Rob and I started to talk again. It was

01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.680
It was I don't know whatever

01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:03.760
I'm I'm I'm over it when I watch that stuff. I'm like, oh, that's cute

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:06.680
That's obviously I'm insane

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.600
so

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:12.440
RJ there was this movie that was playing earlier

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.240
Yeah, it was about these guys and it was a great it was a lot of fun

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:24.000
Can you talk to your friends and ask them way 4.8? I mean

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
I was gonna say something

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:32.040
No, okay. No, not you me. Yeah, you were gonna say something

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:35.040
Yes

01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:37.160
Great

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.160
What

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:43.360
Well, I agree with Dan. Yeah, you know

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:47.960
Everything's okay now. I would yeah, I mean, yeah

01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:51.400
Great. I mean, it's I mean like I

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:53.520
Wasn't

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:59.320
Proud I the one thing that I wish I would have said at the time while we were doing the interview is that I

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:05.160
Stayed I knew it was the right thing to do for me, but I was not

01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:12.020
Proud of that decision at all like it was a decision that I really wish I didn't have to do

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:18.880
Yeah, I don't think anybody says I don't think he made the wrong decision because it's very hard to get

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:25.160
No, I would tell me that's the other thing I would tell people is like the crazy thing is if Rob hadn't stayed

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:30.720
It would be more of a mind fuck right because as I told Rob when Sarah fired me

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:37.680
I was like because Rob had already been riding my trail of tears. Is that a appropriate metaphor? What is that?

01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:46.040
Rob had already been like on that journey with me a couple times and I was like look I get it like obviously

01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:50.240
This is pathological for me. I don't expect you to to keep doing this

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:57.480
It what if Rob had quit out of loyalty? What if a silverman fired me from a basic cable comedy show and Rob had gone?

01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:00.480
Well, you know

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:10.880
Friendship is friendship. Let's just do it. Then I would be fine. I I almost did I was really tempted to you know, but I I

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.360
Never I

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:19.560
Wanted to see if I could do it alone. I mean like when when you're a writing

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:22.920
Or any kind of partnership you're always like

01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:27.520
Well, who's pulling the weight, you know, who's really the smart guy?

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:33.320
Who's really the the guy that's just hanging along and I wanted to see if I could even exist alone

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:37.120
I for the longest time didn't think I could do anything by myself

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:41.560
even the comic book so I

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:47.960
Said this is really a difficult decision, but I really think I need to to do this

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:52.760
Yeah, and yeah, I mean if you get fired in the midst of that, it's like holy shit

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:54.960
Yeah, like now I really have to ask that question

01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:02.080
And answer it and it worked out fine. It was great for now. We're now we're both 53 and we don't yeah shit about anything

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.160
and

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:06.160
All right, well

01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:08.360
We we we we we should

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:16.200
We should let you probably take off. I mean you've got a lot that you have your losing money being up here

01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:23.600
Yeah, RJ. Oh, oh RJ. No RJ will be compensated. Yes, but we should we should put a ribbon on the show and

01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:27.400
For these people these people are losing money. They have

01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:31.260
They have shows to develop tomorrow

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.560
Like Wayne Wayne is like will he notice if I leave?

01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:36.760
the the

01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:41.080
Let's but usually we end the show. We're not gonna play Dungeons and Dragons

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:48.440
I mean, we I don't know how to do it because we're sitting in director's chairs. We don't have the equipment. I was being kidding. I

01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:53.120
Was being kidding

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:57.120
But the show has an addiction to Dungeons and Dragons as a show closer

01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:01.160
So I don't know how to close the show really usually at the show RJ

01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.520
We played Dungeons and Dragons at the end gets it

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:10.440
Do you know if you don't like any chance to have a beatbox to you RJ because I can rap. Oh

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:14.280
You don't know he does no he does I could see it, you know

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:17.320
It seemed like if I do I suck at it

01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:21.280
Oh, so I thought let's hear it. Let's hear your worst beatbox and I'll do mine

01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:34.280
It's just so you don't feel bad. Like what if I what am I what have I started so you could drift it on the back?

01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:36.280
I

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.800
Know you've got you stopped. Oh

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:57.240
Yeah, no, that was amazing. Everyone was like holy shit. Holy shit. I told you to do it

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.360
All right, now we fuck that up

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:05.860
That was great beatboxing because then if I could have just rhymed milk with silk, we could have been done

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:11.420
Suspensive, why don't you beatbox and then you run milk with silk? Oh, I can't beatbox. I was lying

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:18.080
Rob, can you beatbox? No, no, all right. Who's got the best beatbox here?

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.040
Oh, yeah

01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:24.080
Elizabeth you can beatbox

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:26.200
She doesn't look like she wants to do you

01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:29.640
Get up. You don't have to do it. You can

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:40.980
All right, yeah, use the use the Q&A mic. Let's let's let's audition you. Let's see how this goes

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:45.760
