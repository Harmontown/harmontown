{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:11.000\nPlease give a big round of applause to director Neil Berkeley, Dan Harmon, Spencer Crittenden,\n\n00:11.000 --> 00:17.240\nall the fine folks who made that movie, and your guest comptroller for Harmontown Tonight\n\n00:17.240 --> 00:37.240\nis Kumail Nanjiani here. Where's Kumail? There he is. Dan, Dan, et cetera. There's our\n\n00:37.240 --> 00:49.400\nboy. All right. Yeah, we're kind of making the format up as we go. Oh, okay. So should\n\n00:49.400 --> 00:54.600\nI do the thing? I don't know. You could Q&A for a second. Are we recording for the podcast?\n\n00:54.600 --> 00:59.080\nYes. Are we recording? Should I? Well, then I'm going to get the hell out of here. Do\n\n00:59.080 --> 01:04.000\nyou want the Q&A to be part of, we could do it as part of the podcast. Do we do Q&A and\n\n01:04.000 --> 01:09.320\nthen do the podcast? It's called Harmontown. I'm just worried that they watch a two-hour\n\n01:09.320 --> 01:12.960\nmovie and then they're going to sit through the Q&A. We could do the Q&A as part of the\n\n01:12.960 --> 01:18.840\npodcast. Okay, let's do that. All right. So I'm going to introduce you. Pretend he's\n\n01:18.840 --> 01:24.600\nnot here because the fuckers at home don't have visuals. And then he's going to walk\n\n01:24.600 --> 01:31.720\nout when I introduce him. Imagine me having really long, live legs. Yeah, he looks beautiful.\n\n01:31.720 --> 01:41.720\nHey, everyone. Harmontown is now in session. Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmon\n\n01:41.720 --> 01:53.040\nTown, Dan Harmon. Oh, God. Oh, Los Angeles. Oh, God. I can't believe I found you here.\n\n01:53.040 --> 02:00.440\nWow, you got up here pretty quickly. Thank you. Guest Comptroller Kumail Nanjiani, everybody.\n\n02:00.440 --> 02:05.920\nNice back for Silicon Valley. He's not back. You're taking a break, right? Are you halfway\n\n02:05.920 --> 02:09.360\nthrough shooting? No, no, no. We're going to start shooting season two soon. We haven't\n\n02:09.360 --> 02:13.200\nstarted yet. We started. Oh, you haven't started yet? Mm-mm. We've been kind of just\n\n02:13.200 --> 02:18.920\nfucking around. Yeah. I don't know what they're doing. I think writing or something. We changed\n\n02:18.920 --> 02:26.160\nthe words when we Sam. That's a lie. They're amazing. Harmontown fans will agree with\n\n02:26.160 --> 02:32.320\nme that I missed you so much. Oh, yeah, I've been gone a long time. The podcast people.\n\n02:32.320 --> 02:39.320\nYeah. He's not in the movie, but the podcast itself really languishes in your absence.\n\n02:39.320 --> 02:43.360\nOh, I'm sure that's not true, but I appreciate you saying that. Yeah, I really missed doing\n\n02:43.360 --> 02:52.120\nit. Every Sunday, I would be like, oh, right now, Harmontown is happening, and I'm alone\n\n02:52.120 --> 02:57.080\nin a horrible hotel room. So you think about me? I think about the show. I don't think\n\n02:57.080 --> 03:01.040\nabout me. I mean, I think of the show as a whole as an entity separate from you. You're\n\n03:01.040 --> 03:07.360\nin your bed next to your wife. My wife wasn't with me when I was, but... That's all the\n\n03:07.360 --> 03:14.280\nbetter. I think of Harmon. I think of Jeff. I think of Spencer. Don't think about Jeff.\n\n03:14.280 --> 03:18.680\nThink about me. So we just watched this document. I'd never seen it before. Oh, yeah, we watched\n\n03:18.680 --> 03:22.120\nthe documentary. Oh, did you really? That's the first time. Yeah, I thought it was awesome.\n\n03:22.120 --> 03:25.920\nIt's really funny. Yeah, we're here in LA for you podcast listeners. We're at the Vista\n\n03:25.920 --> 03:36.440\nTheater in Los Feliz. And we just watched the Harmontown documentary, which is why\n\n03:36.440 --> 03:41.560\nmy self-loathing is being really... They watched a two-hour movie about this shit. Now they're\n\n03:41.560 --> 03:48.000\nsitting here. We didn't have a bathroom break. I'm really self-conscious right now. I don't\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:51.960\nknow what to do. I think people are going to get up and slowly file out. I wouldn't blame\n\n03:51.960 --> 03:55.440\nthem if they did. Well, no, no, no. They love the movie. And we're going to... No, I know\n\n03:55.440 --> 04:01.560\nthey did. Let's do a Q&A. I know they did. But they have families. They have lives. They\n\n04:01.560 --> 04:09.800\ndon't have families. Did you watch your movie? This is the family. So we were asking in Seattle\n\n04:09.800 --> 04:13.480\nwhat we did is we showed the movie, then we did a Q&A, then we did the podcast. Seattle\n\n04:13.480 --> 04:18.480\nwas awesome, by the way, for our friends in Seattle. You were amazing. Dino guest-controlled.\n\n04:18.480 --> 04:22.840\nHe dropped the N-bomb right at the end of the show, just because he happened. By the\n\n04:22.840 --> 04:27.360\nway, that's a great time to drop it. It's towards the end. But I thought the remarkable\n\n04:27.360 --> 04:31.760\ncultural revolution that happened in Seattle is Dino did that. And the Seattle audience\n\n04:31.760 --> 04:39.320\nkind of just went... Black, white. They didn't care. They were like, I'm not going to let\n\n04:39.320 --> 04:43.520\nthat hijack everything. Well, they'd seen a two-hour documentary and then a whole show\n\n04:43.520 --> 04:47.240\nand a Q&A. They had to go to the bathroom. Maybe. I don't know. But they were kind of\n\n04:47.240 --> 04:51.040\nlike... The message I got from them was, yeah, edit it out. Don't let it... Don't let it\n\n04:51.040 --> 04:55.720\nfuck everything up. Did you edit it out? I did. Are you going to edit this out? No.\n\n04:55.720 --> 05:01.160\nWell, just because it's boring? No. No, because now if you... No, no, I...\n\n05:01.160 --> 05:04.600\nNo, no, I... People will know that he used the N-bomb. Oh, no, no, no. I actually specifically\n\n05:04.600 --> 05:10.080\nwant the people in Seattle to know those 200 people. I want you to know it wasn't a shame-based\n\n05:10.080 --> 05:15.000\nedit. It was like a kind of like actually answering your call to adventure because they sat there\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:22.040\nand were like, yeah, fuck that. We're not going to let the... Who cares? It's a dumb\n\n05:22.040 --> 05:27.680\nword. How do you guys feel about it? No, don't ask. Don't applaud. That feels weird.\n\n05:27.680 --> 05:31.600\nLet's try. On the count of three, let's say the N-word together and see how they react.\n\n05:31.600 --> 05:40.480\nAnd you guys don't react. Don't react. Be better than Seattle. One, two... Okay, alright.\n\n05:40.480 --> 05:46.480\nI can say it if I say the word sand before it. Yeah, you're allowed to. That's in all\n\n05:46.480 --> 05:57.160\nof your people's music. Yeah, what's up, my sand? Oh, yeah. Oh, one, two, one, two. Yo.\n\n05:57.160 --> 06:02.640\nIs that my people's music? I'm trying to improvise a Muslim rap. That's our call to prayer. Like\n\n06:02.640 --> 06:07.680\nactual Muslim rap. Hey, remember right after 9-11 when all the Muslim rappers kind of just\n\n06:07.680 --> 06:14.560\ngot really quiet? Who were the Muslim rappers? Well, I don't know. I remember there was a\n\n06:14.560 --> 06:20.120\nlot of bow ties and a lot of anger in the 9-11 and it was like, okay, well, rap's one thing.\n\n06:20.120 --> 06:26.040\n9-11's another. I just remember it got really quiet, really fast. Yeah, I mean a lot of\n\n06:26.040 --> 06:32.120\nshit was going on after 9-11. I'm sure among them was that the Muslim rappers were like,\n\n06:32.120 --> 06:36.600\nwe're going to lay low for a little bit. Yeah. This album is ready to go, but context has\n\n06:36.600 --> 06:41.960\nchanged. I thought it was kind of funny. So should we... Do you guys have any questions?\n\n06:41.960 --> 06:47.960\nJust raise your hand. We're going to do the Q&A's part of the thing. Yeah, you guys could...\n\n06:47.960 --> 06:51.280\nRaise your hand. I'll call... Oh, you know, how about this? You guys can come and line\n\n06:51.280 --> 06:55.680\nup over here and then we could just go one by one. What do you think? Yep. Yeah, so if\n\n06:55.680 --> 06:59.880\nyou guys... Yeah, we'll set that out there and you guys can come line up if you have\n\n06:59.880 --> 07:06.600\nquestions and ask questions. We should bring... Other people that are going to be on, we\n\n07:06.600 --> 07:11.600\nshould bring them on, right? We should bring Spencer out and we should bring every... Spencer!\n\n07:11.600 --> 07:33.600\nGet up here. Like a gazelle. I'm going to sit here instead. Yay! Yay! Yay! Hey, guys.\n\n07:33.600 --> 07:39.680\nNo, we were doing the podcast. Oh, okay. All right. So do you have any questions? These\n\n07:39.680 --> 07:43.760\nguys get it. They're hip crowd. Well, we don't get it. How are they supposed to get it?\n\n07:43.760 --> 07:49.480\nWe don't get it. Because they get us. All right. If there's any questions about the\n\n07:49.480 --> 07:56.480\ndocumentary, you just... You can go line up over there and then we can... Is one person\n\n07:56.480 --> 08:02.320\na line? I feel like it needs to be a line segment. It's Toby from the office. Everybody\n\n08:02.320 --> 08:11.320\nloves him. So visually, that doesn't land. What's your name, sir? My name is Braden.\n\n08:11.320 --> 08:19.320\nBraden? Yep. What's your question, Braden? So, Mr. Dan, what... Did you have any decision\n\n08:19.320 --> 08:24.000\nmaking and what went into the film? And if not, what would you set the record straight\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:31.680\non? I insisted that Neil put the pedophilia as an option if you have the gumption tongue\n\n08:31.680 --> 08:37.680\ntwister in. He didn't put it in. And I was like, I was really funny in that moment. I\n\n08:37.680 --> 08:45.440\nimprovised alliteration. Do you have any idea how difficult that is? The joke was socially\n\n08:45.440 --> 08:52.800\nunacceptable tongue twister. And I nailed it. Put it in the movie. And Neil was like,\n\n08:52.800 --> 08:57.760\nwell, the chat, you know, Phoenix, you know, it's like, we've already done Crip Death.\n\n08:57.760 --> 09:03.360\nThis feels like a whole other thing. Crip Death was my offer. I took it. I made the\n\n09:03.360 --> 09:09.280\ntouchdown. Right. Yeah. Crip Death was the assist. You were the slam dunk. Yeah. Alley\n\n09:09.280 --> 09:15.680\nU. And it doesn't work. No one laughs at it. But no, I thought it was great. I was very\n\n09:15.680 --> 09:19.880\nproud of myself. That was about it, really. I just kept telling him, put the pedophile\n\n09:19.880 --> 09:24.440\njoke back in the movie. You keep leaving it out. I don't know what to tell you. That\n\n09:24.440 --> 09:29.760\nmight be the first time that that note has been given. There was, I mean, there were\n\n09:29.760 --> 09:35.640\nseveral cuts of the movie. I had to make an agreement with Neil. The guy you're gesturing\n\n09:35.640 --> 09:43.960\nto didn't ask that question. Brayden sat down. Brayden sat down. Sorry. Brayden was pointing\n\n09:43.960 --> 09:53.320\nhim out, though. Yeah. I had to let the director know. It's my tour. It's his movie. So come\n\n09:53.320 --> 10:00.320\non, what may? And he was very respectful. Somebody shouted something out. Can we or\n\n10:00.320 --> 10:07.720\ndid we? What did they say? They want us to bring the director on. Well, yeah. The director's\n\n10:07.720 --> 10:14.920\nmom is obviously in the audience. She's very proud. Please understand, ma'am. It's a very\n\n10:14.920 --> 10:18.880\nconfusing time. We didn't know if it was a Q&A or a podcast. We don't know what we're\n\n10:18.880 --> 10:22.560\ndoing. But you're right. You're absolutely right. He made it. Even though you're only\n\n10:22.560 --> 10:27.400\nsaying that because you gave birth to him, we should probably bring the director on.\n\n10:27.400 --> 10:35.480\nWell, we should wait until she should go stand in line and then when it's her turn. But that's\n\n10:35.480 --> 10:40.240\nif it's just a Q&A. If it's Harmontown, if she can just wander up and go, I want to\n\n10:40.240 --> 10:45.240\neat your face. That's what we've learned about the show. So Neil, come up here. Will you\n\n10:45.240 --> 10:54.200\ncome up here, Neil, please? Is that actually Neil's mom? No, of course not. I'm just trying\n\n10:54.200 --> 10:58.280\nto take away. She's not very proud. She is sitting next to Neil, so I thought it might\n\n10:58.280 --> 11:03.600\nbe it. What, Neil's mom is actually here? No, his mom, her mom. No, Neil hates his family.\n\n11:03.600 --> 11:12.600\nHe's a filmmaker. That was Shannon Russo, wife of EP Joe Russo. I did that. Thank you.\n\n11:12.600 --> 11:23.400\nYes, sir. Oh, yeah. First of all, I love the movie. I'll just say that up front. My question,\n\n11:23.400 --> 11:27.880\nI myself have just finished a lengthy road trip as well. So when you were on your road\n\n11:27.880 --> 11:36.040\ntrip, were there any depths of personal hygiene that you sank to that surprised you?\n\n11:36.040 --> 11:42.600\nWait, I'm glad I'm here because I was asked several times at other moments that weren't\n\n11:42.600 --> 11:47.880\non camera. You've told the story before, but one story from the road that always makes\n\n11:47.880 --> 11:53.080\nme laugh, like I laughed about it this day, was when we broke down and you went back to\n\n11:53.080 --> 11:59.520\nget fries, like you need to remember that? The McDonald's fries. When the engine broke\n\n11:59.520 --> 12:04.200\ndown? Yeah. And we got in and out fries and you weren't satisfied, so you went back to\n\n12:04.200 --> 12:09.880\nget McDonald's fries. That certainly sounds like a rock bottom.\n\n12:09.880 --> 12:15.960\nWait, no. It's not an hygiene thing, but you hid them in the bag and in the bus because\n\n12:15.960 --> 12:20.680\nyou got a quarter pounder as well? Yeah, I was shame eating in the bus.\n\n12:20.680 --> 12:25.080\nYou wanted people to think you were eating in and out, but you were just eating McDonald's\n\n12:25.080 --> 12:29.920\nfries in the internet bag. Wait, so the best you could hope for was that people thinking\n\n12:29.920 --> 12:34.920\nyou're eating slightly less shitty fast food? Yeah, I think at the time I was supposed to\n\n12:34.920 --> 12:38.680\nbe on a diet with Aaron and I think, I don't know. In and out was part of the diet? I don't\n\n12:38.680 --> 12:43.880\nknow. I can't remember. I remember going... No, you didn't like your enough fries. I'm\n\n12:43.880 --> 12:47.080\ngoing to cook some real fries. So you went to McDonald's and you bought fries, but you\n\n12:47.080 --> 12:51.800\nalso bought a quarter pounder and a milkshake, and you put them all in the same bag and went\n\n12:51.800 --> 12:57.720\nin the bus and ate by yourself. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. No, it's fine. It feels a little\n\n12:57.720 --> 13:06.000\nbit like you're just picking on the fat kid, but I'm sure you're a movie maker. It was\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:10.560\ngoing to be either that or the pedophilia joke was going to be in the movie. Yes, guys,\n\n13:10.560 --> 13:17.640\nI ate extra fries. What's your name? Cameron. Cameron, it seems like you had some depth\n\n13:17.640 --> 13:22.560\nyou wanted to tell us about. How do you know when you have a fake name? My name really\n\n13:22.560 --> 13:27.760\nis Cameron Cameron. That's a good sign. I don't know. I was just in my head thinking\n\n13:27.760 --> 13:35.000\neither it was having Wendy's three times in one day or not changing clothes for the first\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:43.800\nthree days of the road trip. Well, what's your question? All of the depths of... That\n\n13:43.800 --> 13:49.920\nwas just me. Yeah. But the question was, what were the depths of... Oh, the hygiene. Yeah.\n\n13:49.920 --> 13:57.640\nI mean, honestly, when I think when I'm moving, I probably shower more than usual, which is\n\n13:57.640 --> 14:04.080\nstill not a lot. I think that when I'm stationary and I have a person that loves me, that's when\n\n14:04.080 --> 14:12.200\nI really push the limits. Like right now, there's like, I don't know, wallpaper peeling.\n\n14:12.200 --> 14:16.880\nI haven't showered in a long time. When was the last time you showered? I have no idea.\n\n14:16.880 --> 14:25.360\nNo memory of it. Don't remember. The water stings my skin. It hurts. It hurts my skin.\n\n14:25.360 --> 14:29.200\nI know that the rest of you get into the shower. You like the feeling of it. And that's why\n\n14:29.200 --> 14:35.320\nyou're not heroes for doing it. It's weird that you get out of something that you like\n\n14:35.320 --> 14:40.400\nand then come and find people like me and make fun of us. Because we're all just doing\n\n14:40.400 --> 14:45.720\nwhat we want to do. Sometimes you like to play basketball. Sometimes you like to take\n\n14:45.720 --> 14:51.240\na shower. Then you come find me. How many showers did you take this month, bro? I don't\n\n14:51.240 --> 15:00.080\nknow. Just guess or I'll punch you. I don't know, three? Three in a month? That's either\n\n15:00.080 --> 15:06.600\ntoo many or too little. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Every day\n\n15:06.600 --> 15:14.200\nis Babylon 5. I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want from me. How many\n\n15:14.200 --> 15:23.880\ntimes should I shower to make you happy? Three. Fuck you. Fuck you. I don't like it. It stings\n\n15:23.880 --> 15:30.320\nmy skin. I like to take baths. I like to submerge myself in hot, soapy water. It takes a long\n\n15:30.320 --> 15:37.800\ntime. I don't do that a lot either. I think that answers your question, Cameron.\n\n15:37.800 --> 15:44.360\nThank you very much, Dan. Thank you, Cameron. But when you go to a hotel, they have nice\n\n15:44.360 --> 15:49.280\nshowers. You go, well, as long as I'm here. Yeah, I was alone for a couple weeks in Baltimore,\n\n15:49.280 --> 15:53.440\ncompletely alone in a hotel room, and I was showering five, six times a day just to class\n\n15:53.440 --> 15:59.000\nthe time. I remember, did you talk about that in Harmontown? Maybe. Maybe I was tweeting\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.480\nabout it because I had nothing to do with the shower. You're like one of those guys\n\n16:01.480 --> 16:05.920\nthat would tease me. What? No. Yeah, because you would then go, oh, I took a shower five\n\n16:05.920 --> 16:10.440\ntimes a day, and you'd be like, yeah, this is a new thing I can brag about. I was like,\n\n16:10.440 --> 16:14.720\nI don't, do you want it to do that? Why can't everyone just do what they want to do? I didn't\n\n16:14.720 --> 16:19.360\nsay anything to you, Dan. No, I know. I was agreeing with you that when I'm moving and\n\n16:19.360 --> 16:22.760\nlonely, I shower more, but if I'm surrounded. Because you can't wait to get in there. That's\n\n16:22.760 --> 16:28.120\ncrazy to me. You have to take off all your clothes. Well, you have to do that with a\n\n16:28.120 --> 16:36.520\nbath, too. No, I don't take a lot of those. You have to take all of your clothes off.\n\n16:36.520 --> 16:42.560\nYou have a problem with nudity? That's just the energy expenditure. It's just everything,\n\n16:42.560 --> 16:45.920\nand then you're going to have to put it back on later, but you're going to be one. I feel\n\n16:45.920 --> 16:52.920\nlike a hero every time I put pants on. I'm like, fuck, I'm so good at this. I hate it.\n\n16:52.920 --> 16:56.320\nSeason three of Community, I came to a point where I was like, I got this. I'm going to\n\n16:56.320 --> 17:04.680\nwear my pajamas to work. I was really proud of myself for a while. I was like, I'm working\n\n17:04.680 --> 17:10.400\non my pajamas, I'm coming to work on my pajamas, inspire leadership in my pajamas. Because\n\n17:10.400 --> 17:15.920\nthe editor would see me and go, what are you doing? I'm doing what you can do. It's called\n\n17:15.920 --> 17:25.240\nfucking culture jamming. Why do you wear pajamas to bed? They're comfortable. Yeah. Well, you\n\n17:25.240 --> 17:29.600\nare going to dream little editor dreams in your little editor bed, in your editor pajamas.\n\n17:29.600 --> 17:35.960\nWear them to work, motherfucker. That's the version of you I want. Relax, sleepy you. Culture\n\n17:35.960 --> 17:37.560\njamming. Culture jamming.\n\n17:37.560 --> 17:46.280\nIf you have a question about culture jamming, it's already been answered.\n\n17:46.280 --> 17:50.680\nIt's not about culture jamming. This is for Dan and Neil. Anne Spencer, what is, and this\n\n17:50.680 --> 17:55.000\nis kind of a twist on the first question, something that wasn't included in the movie,\n\n17:55.000 --> 18:00.400\nbut not for content, but maybe just had to be cut for time or didn't fit the tone that\n\n18:00.400 --> 18:02.200\nyou wish could have been in there?\n\n18:02.200 --> 18:07.080\nHonestly, I feel compelled to tell this story just because I think it's interesting, because\n\n18:07.080 --> 18:12.680\nI think there was this moment, there was this big thing in the documentary that Neil kept\n\n18:12.680 --> 18:20.040\nincluding where I jokingly called Aaron the C-word. It was like 10 minutes into the movie.\n\n18:20.040 --> 18:25.080\nWe had just gotten out of the road, and Neil, I don't want to say you thought it was funny,\n\n18:25.080 --> 18:29.480\nand I'm going to make you sound like you're some kind of weirdo, but you were like, well,\n\n18:29.480 --> 18:33.040\nit's obviously a joke. It says a lot about your relationship, because Aaron thought it\n\n18:33.040 --> 18:37.320\nwas funny, and we were like, joke about it, but it didn't translate. The bottom line is\n\n18:37.320 --> 18:44.840\nthings like the C-word, for instance. It changes the experience in the movie you're watching.\n\n18:44.840 --> 18:49.080\nSo I was saying to Neil, I want you to understand that I do not want to look like a good person\n\n18:49.080 --> 18:55.240\nin this movie, but I also want you to understand that that early in the film, that's going\n\n18:55.240 --> 18:59.760\nto be like this weird, if you went on a roller coaster and just a pelican dropped into your\n\n18:59.760 --> 19:05.280\nlap, it changes the roller coaster. Is this a Wild West theme roller coaster? Is it a\n\n19:05.280 --> 19:09.760\nspace theme roller coaster? It doesn't matter. Now it's a pelican themed roller coaster.\n\n19:09.760 --> 19:14.240\nIt changes the audience's experience. Save that shit for later. Aaron says later, he\n\n19:14.240 --> 19:18.080\ncalled me the C-word and you hear the audience, boo, it's part of the story.\n\n19:18.080 --> 19:24.160\nYeah, you can't have two subplots about the C-word. No, it's just a bit. It's like, oh,\n\n19:24.160 --> 19:28.880\nthey're hilarious together. It does not translate, trust me. It was like, remember when I, in\n\n19:28.880 --> 19:35.840\nthe movie, when I go to hubris to go on the perfect tour, tour, tour, and I do a fake\n\n19:35.840 --> 19:40.800\necho on my own, and then Aaron says, why are you doing the echo? They can do the echo\n\n19:40.800 --> 19:46.560\nlater, and I'm like, that's the bit. It's meta. It's like if we did a documentary about\n\n19:46.560 --> 19:50.240\nhow we fight all the time, and then she says, we don't fight all the time, and I'm like,\n\n19:50.240 --> 19:54.560\nyes, we do. And she's like, no, we don't. And we start fighting and it's a funny bit\n\n19:54.560 --> 20:01.160\nand it culminates in me calling her the C-word. And it's hilarious in our lives and not a\n\n20:01.160 --> 20:04.600\ngood thing to happen 10 minutes into the movie. So that's an example.\n\n20:04.600 --> 20:07.840\nAt the time, it was a character thing, but it says a lot of people have asked like, what\n\n20:07.840 --> 20:12.120\nwas it like to make a movie with a guy who's in the movie he's producing? And that was\n\n20:12.120 --> 20:15.280\na note where, damn, there was a moment where at the very end, you said, look, I'll tell\n\n20:15.280 --> 20:20.480\nyou one last time, I've been in rooms where people have said the C-word and the N-word,\n\n20:20.480 --> 20:24.080\nthe G-word, the Q-word. Get ready and we look at it.\n\n20:24.080 --> 20:32.840\nIs Q-word just cunt with a Q? No, it's Q-word. People are really sensitive about Q and C's.\n\n20:32.840 --> 20:37.120\nThank you. Thank you. So that's when it came out, as I was like,\n\n20:37.120 --> 20:40.640\nokay, I hear what you're saying. I understand that note. It's not about you being a good\n\n20:40.640 --> 20:43.720\nperson or a bad person. You're talking about losing an audience.\n\n20:43.720 --> 20:47.200\nYeah, I had to promise. I'm going to swear to God I'm not. I'm not trying to make myself\n\n20:47.200 --> 20:52.160\nlook cool here. Just please don't keep that part in. I think that answered your question.\n\n20:52.160 --> 20:53.960\nI don't know. Does that answer that one?\n\n20:53.960 --> 20:58.520\nI mean, this doesn't really qualify as an answer to your question, but every time I\n\n20:58.520 --> 21:03.920\nsee it, there's this guy wearing this orange brown beanie cap and you see him twice in\n\n21:03.920 --> 21:07.640\nthe whole movie and they're really close together. And that guy gave me that beanie\n\n21:07.640 --> 21:11.680\nduring one of the shows. And every time I see it, I'm like, that beanie has a story\n\n21:11.680 --> 21:18.440\nto it. That only I know. And no one else is going to know this, but now you guys do,\n\n21:18.440 --> 21:20.880\nmaybe. Wait, was your question about things that were\n\n21:20.880 --> 21:24.360\nnot in the movie? What ended up outside the movie?\n\n21:24.360 --> 21:28.800\nOh, yes. I will tell you this. Soon. All right. I fucked up my answer.\n\n21:28.800 --> 21:32.440\nNo, no, no. Your answer was totally good, right?\n\n21:32.440 --> 21:37.920\nBut soon, next week, someday, you'll all learn that there's going to be a place, I don't\n\n21:37.920 --> 21:40.280\nknow what I can talk about, but there's going to be a place on the Internet where you can\n\n21:40.280 --> 21:45.720\ngo there called harm attend dot com and see the making of chicken noodle dick.\n\n21:45.720 --> 21:49.800\nThat's which it's a it's a scene that didn't make it in the movie, but it's it's pretty\n\n21:49.800 --> 21:52.320\namazing and I can't wait for you all to see it.\n\n21:52.320 --> 21:55.880\nIt is kind of interesting because we got high and we're on the bus and we're just laying\n\n21:55.880 --> 22:00.880\nthere giggling and but it takes forever because you don't want to jump cut within it.\n\n22:00.880 --> 22:06.440\nWell, it takes like six. There's a there's a honey bear dick song and there's a aspirin\n\n22:06.440 --> 22:12.600\ndick. There's several dicks that were sung about until chicken noodle became the Huckleberry.\n\n22:12.600 --> 22:16.600\nYeah.\n\n22:16.600 --> 22:19.760\nThe Huckleberry of what? What does that mean?\n\n22:19.760 --> 22:22.040\nYeah, I didn't get that either. What is Huckleberry?\n\n22:22.040 --> 22:24.200\nWe almost just glide glid glid.\n\n22:24.200 --> 22:28.680\nAre you just trying to start a new like phrase? You're trying to slip it in?\n\n22:28.680 --> 22:34.120\nNo, that's fucking Huckleberry anyway. Neil, that's not a thing anyone says.\n\n22:34.120 --> 22:40.120\nI spread that instead of saying Huckleberry, your Huckleberry, it's from the tombstone.\n\n22:40.120 --> 22:46.120\nOh, yeah, that movie that is part of the Mexican.\n\n22:46.120 --> 22:53.000\nIt's like you were referencing Wizard of Oz.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:56.680\nWhy did people quote that thing? He goes, I'll be a Huckleberry and everyone's like,\n\n22:56.680 --> 22:59.960\nyeah, what a badass. What the fuck is he talking about?\n\n22:59.960 --> 23:02.840\nI never got that, Neil. What the fuck are you talking about?\n\n23:02.840 --> 23:04.360\nI don't know. I don't know what it means.\n\n23:04.360 --> 23:07.320\nI'm your Huckleberry. What do you mean you're his Huckleberry?\n\n23:07.320 --> 23:10.680\nLike, he's Tom Sawyer? Don't shoot him then.\n\n23:10.680 --> 23:13.560\nOh, it must be that. That makes a lot of sense, actually.\n\n23:13.560 --> 23:15.160\nWas that book contemporary?\n\n23:15.160 --> 23:20.840\nWell, it was Mark Twain's classic, and you know, Huckleberry was like, I'm the grounded\n\n23:20.840 --> 23:21.840\nsidekick.\n\n23:21.840 --> 23:26.280\nI'm your Huckleberry, and he's like dying against a tree.\n\n23:26.280 --> 23:27.280\nHow are you my Huckleberry?\n\n23:27.280 --> 23:28.280\nI didn't see the movie.\n\n23:28.280 --> 23:33.000\nYou should check it out. It's a really good movie.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:34.360\nAlso watch Silverado.\n\n23:34.360 --> 23:35.880\nAlso read Huck Finn.\n\n23:35.880 --> 23:37.120\nYeah, sure.\n\n23:37.120 --> 23:40.920\nIf you love the N-word.\n\n23:40.920 --> 23:43.640\nAlso read Huck Finn.\n\n23:43.640 --> 23:45.680\nIf you love the N-word.\n\n23:45.680 --> 23:50.800\nIf you love the N-word, you'll love the new Toyota Corolla.\n\n23:50.800 --> 23:53.760\nSponsor of Hamilton.\n\n23:53.760 --> 23:54.760\nSmooth.\n\n23:54.760 --> 23:55.760\nSmooth.\n\n23:55.760 --> 23:58.480\nI don't know what that sounds like. Go ahead.\n\n23:58.480 --> 24:00.040\nHi, I'm Adam.\n\n24:00.040 --> 24:01.440\nAdam, nice to meet you.\n\n24:01.440 --> 24:03.880\nI have a question for Dan, and then one for Spencer.\n\n24:03.880 --> 24:04.880\nYes.\n\n24:04.880 --> 24:05.880\nSo Dan.\n\n24:05.880 --> 24:08.880\nI'm sorry, after you ask the question, you're going to have to go to the back of the line.\n\n24:08.880 --> 24:09.880\nAsk Spencer.\n\n24:09.880 --> 24:14.560\nAll right, Dan, what was the feeling like when NBC got ahold of you and were like, hey, we're\n\n24:14.560 --> 24:15.560\nsorry.\n\n24:15.560 --> 24:16.560\nCome back.\n\n24:16.560 --> 24:19.640\nThey did. That didn't happen.\n\n24:19.640 --> 24:22.120\nThese things don't happen.\n\n24:22.120 --> 24:26.080\nIf you ever are privileged to be fired from a television show, the way you find out is\n\n24:26.080 --> 24:29.400\nyour agent tells you, and then your agent tells you you've been rehired.\n\n24:29.400 --> 24:30.400\nThat's it.\n\n24:30.400 --> 24:37.000\nIt doesn't, none of the suits actually meet you and say that they are your Huckleberry.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:38.000\nThey don't.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:39.000\nNo.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.480\nThere's no boom box outside the window.\n\n24:41.480 --> 24:43.880\nThat's from a movie called Say Anything.\n\n24:43.880 --> 24:47.960\nYou know how in firing squads, I don't know if you know this, when they used to shoot\n\n24:47.960 --> 24:51.120\npeople to kill them officially.\n\n24:51.120 --> 24:53.800\nThey would, one person would have a blank.\n\n24:53.800 --> 24:55.880\nThey would put one blank in it.\n\n24:55.880 --> 25:00.080\nIt's a systemic, you know, unaccountability.\n\n25:00.080 --> 25:04.720\nEach person gets to think, I'm probably not the one actually killing this person.\n\n25:04.720 --> 25:06.760\nI'm probably a hero.\n\n25:06.760 --> 25:09.280\nThat's television.\n\n25:09.280 --> 25:11.120\nEveryone just goes, hey, what am I doing?\n\n25:11.120 --> 25:12.120\nI don't know.\n\n25:12.120 --> 25:13.120\nFuck it.\n\n25:13.120 --> 25:14.120\nMy parents are rich.\n\n25:14.120 --> 25:15.440\nI'll just do this.\n\n25:15.440 --> 25:21.880\nAnd then if you get fired, you find out not by anybody telling you anything that would\n\n25:21.880 --> 25:26.760\never reflect poorly on them, you find out by the phone not ringing.\n\n25:26.760 --> 25:32.440\nAnd then when you get rehired, again, it's like, hey, I guess I'm back.\n\n25:32.440 --> 25:34.520\nYeah, it's not exciting.\n\n25:34.520 --> 25:37.640\nSo fuck you, kid.\n\n25:37.640 --> 25:40.440\nAdam, your question for Spencer?\n\n25:40.440 --> 25:43.760\nSpencer, what's your favorite addition of D&D to play?\n\n25:43.760 --> 25:49.040\nWe play Pathfinder, which is an officially D&D, as it were, but it counts.\n\n25:49.040 --> 25:50.040\nIt counts.\n\n25:50.040 --> 25:54.240\nFifth edition of official D&Ds just came out, and I'd recommend it to new players.\n\n25:54.240 --> 25:57.280\nIt's a very joyless sounding answer.\n\n25:57.280 --> 25:58.280\nI love that.\n\n25:58.280 --> 25:59.280\nThank you.\n\n25:59.280 --> 26:00.280\nThank you.\n\n26:00.280 --> 26:01.280\nHi.\n\n26:01.280 --> 26:02.280\nI'm Mark.\n\n26:02.280 --> 26:10.600\nThis question for Dan, since they didn't get picked up, can we kind of know what those\n\n26:10.600 --> 26:13.120\npilots were about in the movie?\n\n26:13.120 --> 26:21.360\nThe CVS pilot was, it was sort of an absolutely fabulous kind of rip-off.\n\n26:21.360 --> 26:31.640\nIt was about a, it was actually my fiancee, Aaron's idea, it was about a guy who had been\n\n26:31.640 --> 26:39.000\na rock star in the 90s who had returned to his hometown and opened a bar.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:43.840\nAnd he was in his 40s, and he was just running this bar, and kind of, he was, you know, he\n\n26:43.840 --> 26:50.240\nwas the consummate non-sellout, and a former rock star who people would come to his bar\n\n26:50.240 --> 26:54.160\nand be like, oh man, this fucking guy used to be in this thing, and he's not a sellout.\n\n26:54.160 --> 26:55.640\nHe owns this bar now.\n\n26:55.640 --> 27:00.440\nAnd then this 15-year-old girl walks in, and the pilot, she's his previously unknown\n\n27:00.440 --> 27:01.440\ndaughter.\n\n27:01.440 --> 27:02.440\nHuckleberry.\n\n27:02.440 --> 27:08.560\nShe's his Huckleberry, and she wants to come live with him so she can get into an art school\n\n27:08.560 --> 27:13.720\nthat if she, if she has a residence there in that city, she can go to this art school\n\n27:13.720 --> 27:14.720\nthat she wants to go to.\n\n27:14.720 --> 27:20.600\nSo it's really ABFAB, it's with a dude, which hopefully would have been Jack Black, but then\n\n27:20.600 --> 27:23.120\nhe didn't want to do it, so it died.\n\n27:23.120 --> 27:24.120\nBut it was pretty cool.\n\n27:24.120 --> 27:25.120\nI haven't read it.\n\n27:25.120 --> 27:26.120\nThat sounds good.\n\n27:26.120 --> 27:27.120\nYou haven't read it?\n\n27:27.120 --> 27:28.120\nWell, I haven't read it since I gave it to him.\n\n27:28.120 --> 27:29.120\nIt might suck.\n\n27:29.120 --> 27:30.120\nBut I thought it was pretty good.\n\n27:30.120 --> 27:31.280\nThat does sound awesome.\n\n27:31.280 --> 27:32.280\nWhat was the Fox one?\n\n27:32.280 --> 27:33.280\nI don't know.\n\n27:33.280 --> 27:39.240\nActually, the Fox thing, the Fox thing was going to be like 30 Rock in a video game studio.\n\n27:39.240 --> 27:44.200\nBasically, it was going to be like, yeah, I mean, if you wait long enough, everyone\n\n27:44.200 --> 27:45.920\nthat hired you gets fired.\n\n27:45.920 --> 27:49.280\nSo like the Fox that I worked for doesn't exist anymore.\n\n27:49.280 --> 27:51.400\nIt's every all different people now.\n\n27:51.400 --> 27:52.400\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n27:52.400 --> 27:58.520\nIt's not like there's some guy going, I'm Mr. Fox, you regret this decision.\n\n27:58.520 --> 28:02.400\nYou just signed a deal with some guy named like Kevin Johnson, and then Kevin Johnson\n\n28:02.400 --> 28:04.040\nwas like, now I'm at CBS.\n\n28:04.040 --> 28:05.040\nOh, shit.\n\n28:05.040 --> 28:06.040\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n28:06.040 --> 28:07.040\nIt's fine.\n\n28:07.040 --> 28:16.440\nHey, I just want to point out that I thought it was pretty funny.\n\n28:16.440 --> 28:21.480\nYou guys jumping onto, making fun of someone for making a film reference that was like,\n\n28:21.480 --> 28:24.840\nit was like, oh, we're all nerds here, but that's seen with Val Kilmer.\n\n28:24.840 --> 28:25.840\nNo one was going to reference that.\n\n28:25.840 --> 28:26.840\nI wasn't going to get that.\n\n28:26.840 --> 28:27.840\nWhat's kind of funny?\n\n28:27.840 --> 28:28.840\nI'm joking.\n\n28:28.840 --> 28:34.880\nI was, because we jumped on him, I was jumping on you to make a joke, and then it just came\n\n28:34.880 --> 28:35.880\nacross as me.\n\n28:35.880 --> 28:36.880\nIt's okay.\n\n28:36.880 --> 28:37.880\nYou blocked me on Twitter.\n\n28:37.880 --> 28:38.880\nIt's fine.\n\n28:38.880 --> 28:39.880\nI get it.\n\n28:39.880 --> 28:40.880\nI did block you?\n\n28:40.880 --> 28:41.880\nYeah.\n\n28:41.880 --> 28:42.880\nOh, okay.\n\n28:42.880 --> 28:43.880\nYou probably just served it.\n\n28:43.880 --> 28:44.880\nYeah, I did.\n\n28:44.880 --> 28:45.880\nWhat did you do?\n\n28:45.880 --> 28:51.040\nI think I was really happy that Emily followed me, and I was like, oh, your Twitter follow\n\n28:51.040 --> 28:54.880\nthat's soon going to follow going to be hack or something, and then after that I was blocked.\n\n28:54.880 --> 28:55.880\nOh, no.\n\n28:55.880 --> 28:56.880\nIt must have been a mistake.\n\n28:56.880 --> 28:57.880\nThat doesn't sound like a blockable.\n\n28:57.880 --> 28:59.640\nThat's something else that I surely...\n\n28:59.640 --> 29:00.640\nThe fuck is going on?\n\n29:00.640 --> 29:01.640\nSee?\n\n29:01.640 --> 29:02.640\nHe's asking for it.\n\n29:02.640 --> 29:03.640\nI don't know.\n\n29:03.640 --> 29:04.640\nAnyway, go ahead.\n\n29:04.640 --> 29:05.640\nYeah, okay.\n\n29:05.640 --> 29:06.640\nSorry about that.\n\n29:06.640 --> 29:08.640\nMy questions are for Spencer, actually.\n\n29:08.640 --> 29:09.640\nYes.\n\n29:09.640 --> 29:10.640\nTo Parter.\n\n29:10.640 --> 29:11.640\nOh, thank...\n\n29:11.640 --> 29:12.640\nNo.\n\n29:12.640 --> 29:18.760\nNumber one, I'm kind of new to the world of D&D, I just got into it for professional\n\n29:18.760 --> 29:19.760\nreasons.\n\n29:19.760 --> 29:20.760\nWait.\n\n29:20.760 --> 29:21.760\nWow.\n\n29:21.760 --> 29:23.640\nAre you trying to get a job in Hollywood?\n\n29:23.640 --> 29:24.640\nNo.\n\n29:24.640 --> 29:25.640\nYeah.\n\n29:25.640 --> 29:29.880\nI really want to be the second host, like the other guy on the couch.\n\n29:29.880 --> 29:30.880\nMy god.\n\n29:30.880 --> 29:31.880\nI don't have a couch.\n\n29:31.880 --> 29:32.880\nOkay.\n\n29:32.880 --> 29:33.880\nI don't even own a couch.\n\n29:33.880 --> 29:37.400\nSomebody get this guy a couch.\n\n29:37.400 --> 29:38.400\nTrevor?\n\n29:38.400 --> 29:39.400\nXanthan?\n\n29:39.400 --> 29:42.720\nAh, Xanthan.\n\n29:42.720 --> 29:45.440\nHe can haul a couch.\n\n29:45.440 --> 29:53.080\nIt's just for game design, but I noticed a lot of other game designers have this really\n\n29:53.080 --> 29:56.720\npersonal deep relationship where they really cherish their D&D memories, just role-playing\n\n29:56.720 --> 30:03.640\ngame memories in general, and a lot of them saw it as not just their first introduction\n\n30:03.640 --> 30:08.520\nto rules and systems for a game, but also for building a community and having social\n\n30:08.520 --> 30:09.520\ninteraction that you're kind of...\n\n30:09.520 --> 30:12.440\nYou don't want to be lame and be like, oh man, I miss my friends if I don't see them\n\n30:12.440 --> 30:13.440\nevery week.\n\n30:13.440 --> 30:16.760\nBut so you put that all into like, hey, we've got to play this game every week, right?\n\n30:16.760 --> 30:19.920\nWe have this social contract to hang out with each other and work our shit out because\n\n30:19.920 --> 30:21.320\nwe have to play this game every week.\n\n30:21.320 --> 30:25.600\nI was wondering if that was your experience with D&D?\n\n30:25.600 --> 30:28.280\nLike having really fond memories of building communities?\n\n30:28.280 --> 30:31.760\nYeah, and playing with friends, making it very social.\n\n30:31.760 --> 30:38.080\nI mean, that's all, in my opinion, that's the worst part of Dungeons & Dragons is that\n\n30:38.080 --> 30:44.280\nit really brings out the darkness in interpersonal relationships, and they always come to the\n\n30:44.280 --> 30:45.280\nsurface.\n\n30:45.280 --> 30:50.160\nIf it turns out you really hate your friend's haircut, like in Dungeons & Dragons, you're\n\n30:50.160 --> 30:57.000\ngoing to get in a fistfight over that, and the rules have been my refuge from thinking\n\n30:57.000 --> 31:00.800\nabout all the social problems that I've experienced.\n\n31:00.800 --> 31:02.800\nIt's been kind of nightmarish.\n\n31:02.800 --> 31:08.080\nI've lost like three groups of friends, probably, that just hate each other because of Dungeons\n\n31:08.080 --> 31:15.320\n& Dragons games, so I mean, I wish I could, yeah, but it breaks up families.\n\n31:15.320 --> 31:20.120\nMaybe I already have the answer to part two of my question was like, would you think about\n\n31:20.120 --> 31:25.600\ndoing like a game at PAX or something like that, I think, that might draw a crowd.\n\n31:25.600 --> 31:29.960\nI'll do whatever anyone will, you know, pay for.\n\n31:29.960 --> 31:32.080\nNot pay me for, but like get me out there.\n\n31:32.080 --> 31:33.640\nHe's like Alex P. Keaton over here.\n\n31:33.640 --> 31:35.840\nI don't, you know, I don't got much going on.\n\n31:35.840 --> 31:42.280\nI don't, you know, I don't have to do it for the love of the game, man, love the game,\n\n31:42.280 --> 31:43.280\nman.\n\n31:43.280 --> 31:44.280\nThank you.\n\n31:44.280 --> 31:45.280\nThanks, man.\n\n31:45.280 --> 31:48.480\nThis is a great two part question, by the way.\n\n31:48.480 --> 31:51.960\nI shit all over the second part.\n\n31:51.960 --> 31:53.760\nYou know, two part questions are bullshit.\n\n31:53.760 --> 31:54.760\nYeah.\n\n31:54.760 --> 31:55.760\nEverybody does that.\n\n31:55.760 --> 31:56.760\nYou're basically cheating.\n\n31:56.760 --> 31:57.760\nYes.\n\n31:57.760 --> 31:58.760\nLike what?\n\n31:58.760 --> 32:00.400\nI have a, hello, I'm Oliver Twist.\n\n32:00.400 --> 32:06.320\nI have a two part bowl that I like filled with soup.\n\n32:06.320 --> 32:07.760\nObviously that's not allowed.\n\n32:07.760 --> 32:13.520\nIt's not allowed, that's, you're just, you're describing a tray.\n\n32:13.520 --> 32:19.520\nYeah, so what's your Twitter handle?\n\n32:19.520 --> 32:29.520\nIt's a double question at 69.twitter, I don't know how Twitter works.\n\n32:29.520 --> 32:32.000\nAll right, Benny and June, let's go.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.600\nSo first off, I love the movie.\n\n32:34.600 --> 32:35.600\nFirst off, I love the movie.\n\n32:35.600 --> 32:39.600\nSorry to sound like a broken record, but I was wondering since Yahoo's been our savior\n\n32:39.600 --> 32:44.400\nand is bringing back community, if you're looking forward to rubbing it in NBC's face.\n\n32:44.400 --> 32:49.480\nWell they still own, NBC still owns the show, I mean, so it's like as successful as the\n\n32:49.480 --> 32:55.080\nshow is, then they'll be like, thank you, I don't know, there's no way out of it.\n\n32:55.080 --> 32:59.880\nIf you're making a show for, the only way to get revenge on all the suits in the world\n\n32:59.880 --> 33:05.200\nis to make something in your sandbox that they don't own, and then no one gets to see\n\n33:05.200 --> 33:06.200\nit.\n\n33:06.200 --> 33:10.480\nAnd you're really brave in 23, which you are, and you could, like, don't work with\n\n33:10.480 --> 33:12.400\nSony and NBC and all that stuff.\n\n33:12.400 --> 33:16.640\nBut if you are, if you have gone down that road and you've created a show, like community,\n\n33:16.640 --> 33:21.920\nthat has NBC's money in it, Sony's money in it, and now Yahoo's money in it, you know,\n\n33:21.920 --> 33:27.320\nyou can't really get revenge on anybody, you're in it with the fans and the money's coming\n\n33:27.320 --> 33:28.960\nfrom everywhere and you can't.\n\n33:28.960 --> 33:33.400\nIt's weird because I guess if it succeeds, they get money, and if it loses, well they\n\n33:33.400 --> 33:35.400\nwere right for canceling it.\n\n33:35.400 --> 33:36.400\nYeah.\n\n33:36.400 --> 33:39.000\nAnd in either case, they're not going to care.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:46.520\nIt's like, you know, NBC's going to be a food channel by then, or the most important network\n\n33:46.520 --> 33:47.520\nin the world.\n\n33:47.520 --> 33:48.520\nI mean, we don't know.\n\n33:48.520 --> 33:49.520\nEverything changes every year.\n\n33:49.520 --> 33:53.120\nI caught myself because I was quoted on TMZ as saying something.\n\n33:53.120 --> 33:57.760\nYeah, NBC will be a food network in a year.\n\n33:57.760 --> 34:03.600\nDan Harmon slams Food Network.\n\n34:03.600 --> 34:07.960\nTheir job isn't to care and our job isn't to get revenge on them because there is no\n\n34:07.960 --> 34:08.960\nthem.\n\n34:08.960 --> 34:11.120\nThat's the problem with them is that they're not them.\n\n34:11.120 --> 34:12.440\nWe are them.\n\n34:12.440 --> 34:13.600\nThey aren't them.\n\n34:13.600 --> 34:15.480\nThey are corporations.\n\n34:15.480 --> 34:18.200\nThe them is inside of us.\n\n34:18.200 --> 34:22.360\nIf you compete with them, then you're going to fuck the them that you are.\n\n34:22.360 --> 34:26.800\nLike the only them that is is Vince Gilligan and people who make shows.\n\n34:26.800 --> 34:30.800\nLike the people who make the costumes and the props and they actually roll the cameras\n\n34:30.800 --> 34:31.800\nand stuff.\n\n34:31.800 --> 34:36.240\nThere's the them and Los Angeles is filled with them and then there's the them that's\n\n34:36.240 --> 34:43.280\nlike what, the logo, natgeo.org or whatever you end up airing on.\n\n34:43.280 --> 34:47.680\nThose people, if they're the good guys or the bad guys, you're equally psychotic because\n\n34:47.680 --> 34:50.080\nyou have to just make a product.\n\n34:50.080 --> 34:56.480\nI was wondering when we can expect the Spencer brand D20s to be in store.\n\n34:56.480 --> 34:57.480\nOh man.\n\n34:57.480 --> 34:58.480\nYou're like Peter North.\n\n34:58.480 --> 35:00.800\nYou're like Peter North.\n\n35:00.800 --> 35:04.760\nThe negotiations with Chessix Dice have really gone south.\n\n35:04.760 --> 35:11.200\nI'm going to have to get my own injection mold and it's a real to do.\n\n35:11.200 --> 35:12.200\nThank you.\n\n35:12.200 --> 35:13.200\nHi, I'm Evan.\n\n35:13.200 --> 35:14.200\nNice to meet you all.\n\n35:14.200 --> 35:19.200\nHey Evan, nice to meet you.\n\n35:19.200 --> 35:23.120\nMy question is between like, you know, writing the pilot scripts and like making songs about\n\n35:23.120 --> 35:24.120\nPringles' dicks.\n\n35:24.120 --> 35:28.280\nWhat kinds of things do you, what kinds of things did you do between tourists the past\n\n35:28.280 --> 35:29.780\nof time?\n\n35:29.780 --> 35:30.780\nThat's it.\n\n35:30.780 --> 35:33.200\nI mean, the Pringles' dick song and the, what is he sleeping?\n\n35:33.200 --> 35:34.200\nSleepy.\n\n35:34.200 --> 35:35.200\nWhat's the past of time?\n\n35:35.200 --> 35:36.200\nSleepy.\n\n35:36.200 --> 35:37.200\nI don't know.\n\n35:37.200 --> 35:38.200\nYou play video games?\n\n35:38.200 --> 35:39.200\nSong stuff.\n\n35:39.200 --> 35:40.200\nNow, just Minecraft.\n\n35:40.200 --> 35:41.200\nThat's it.\n\n35:41.200 --> 35:43.080\nBut that deserves to be talked about on a level of like heroin.\n\n35:43.080 --> 35:45.200\nLike I have a problem right now.\n\n35:45.200 --> 35:48.700\nLike season six of community is going to be worse because of Minecraft.\n\n35:48.700 --> 35:50.200\nIt's going to be a Minecraft episode.\n\n35:50.200 --> 35:51.800\nIt's like that's like your edition.\n\n35:51.800 --> 35:52.800\nI don't know.\n\n35:52.800 --> 35:55.720\nI keep saying to the writers, we should do a Minecraft episode, but it's like, it's\n\n35:55.720 --> 35:57.960\nlike a junkie saying we should do a heroin episode.\n\n35:57.960 --> 36:02.080\nAnd they're like, yeah, I bet we should.\n\n36:02.080 --> 36:05.280\nThat would make you real happy, wouldn't it, boss?\n\n36:05.280 --> 36:09.720\nMake that needle dangling out of your arm like a prop instead of a fucking thing that\n\n36:09.720 --> 36:12.080\nwe need to deal with.\n\n36:12.080 --> 36:13.080\nClean up your act.\n\n36:13.080 --> 36:17.920\nAnd I guess it's like, this kind of involves Spencer, but what inspired you to have him\n\n36:17.920 --> 36:20.040\nin the VCR episode?\n\n36:20.040 --> 36:22.040\nIs everyone asking many questions?\n\n36:22.040 --> 36:23.040\nWhat are the rules?\n\n36:23.040 --> 36:24.040\nI don't know, man.\n\n36:24.040 --> 36:25.040\nWhat are the rules?\n\n36:25.040 --> 36:28.640\nIs this a Q and A or a podcast?\n\n36:28.640 --> 36:29.640\nI don't know.\n\n36:29.640 --> 36:33.840\nI mean, we know it's obviously we're into Harmontown.\n\n36:33.840 --> 36:34.840\nWe're into Harmontown.\n\n36:34.840 --> 36:35.840\nYeah.\n\n36:35.840 --> 36:39.240\nIt's the worst Harmontown ever and the best Q and A ever.\n\n36:39.240 --> 36:40.240\nThat's right.\n\n36:40.240 --> 36:42.240\nThis is the Venn diagram.\n\n36:42.240 --> 36:43.240\nOverlap.\n\n36:43.240 --> 36:44.240\nI don't know what words mean.\n\n36:44.240 --> 36:45.240\nGo ahead.\n\n36:45.240 --> 36:46.240\nWhat happened?\n\n36:46.240 --> 36:47.240\nWas there a question?\n\n36:47.240 --> 36:48.240\nThe audience?\n\n36:48.240 --> 36:49.240\nYeah.\n\n36:49.240 --> 36:52.120\nWhat inspired having Spencer on the VCR episode?\n\n36:52.120 --> 36:53.120\nOh, that's not to me.\n\n36:53.120 --> 36:54.120\nThat's you.\n\n36:54.120 --> 36:55.120\nI thought of you.\n\n36:55.120 --> 36:56.120\nI didn't inspire it.\n\n36:56.120 --> 36:57.120\nI don't know.\n\n36:57.120 --> 37:01.200\nI kind of feel like he's, he looks like he could be Alice and Bree's brother.\n\n37:01.200 --> 37:02.200\nI don't know.\n\n37:02.200 --> 37:03.200\nYeah.\n\n37:03.200 --> 37:07.480\nHe's a beautiful viking, like with these piercing eyes.\n\n37:07.480 --> 37:09.480\nHe does have a very handsome face.\n\n37:09.480 --> 37:10.480\nI do.\n\n37:10.480 --> 37:11.480\nI honestly can't remember.\n\n37:11.480 --> 37:12.480\nI don't know.\n\n37:12.480 --> 37:13.480\nNo.\n\n37:13.480 --> 37:14.480\nI know what it was.\n\n37:14.480 --> 37:17.040\nI guess I can't answer this question.\n\n37:17.040 --> 37:21.120\nThere was a character who, well, it's fine to say plots that are never going to happen.\n\n37:21.120 --> 37:22.120\nYeah.\n\n37:22.120 --> 37:24.160\nI mean, we were pitching a story about Britta.\n\n37:24.160 --> 37:29.280\nAbout Britta hooking up with Annie's brother, and that plot line kind of fell away and transmitted\n\n37:29.280 --> 37:30.720\ninto this different plot line.\n\n37:30.720 --> 37:36.680\nAnnie's brother was going to be like a photojournalist who was like a Mark Ruffalo type, who Britta\n\n37:36.680 --> 37:39.560\nimmediately pounced on and was going to cause a stripe between them.\n\n37:39.560 --> 37:41.560\nIt's like the boy next door kind of thing.\n\n37:41.560 --> 37:45.400\nIt felt a little uninspired, and then I was like, what if, what, what, what is Annie's\n\n37:45.400 --> 37:46.760\nbrother not supposed to be?\n\n37:46.760 --> 37:50.000\nThe characterization of that kind of fell away, and then there was like, oh, I guess\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:54.320\nanyone can do it, and then someone put like Viking type in the, in the script, and then\n\n37:54.320 --> 37:57.200\neveryone thought it was me, and then I got cast.\n\n37:57.200 --> 38:01.960\nThe writers were quite taken with him, because I had this guy coming in, and then he'd go\n\n38:01.960 --> 38:05.840\nlike, Dan, what size are your pants?\n\n38:05.840 --> 38:08.000\nAnd so the writers were like, who is that?\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:12.160\nThat's my dungeon master.\n\n38:12.160 --> 38:17.000\nYou also had a documentary that desperately needed an ending.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nThat's true as well.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:20.000\nYes.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:24.680\nWait, can I do the honorable thing, and that is not going to go well?\n\n38:24.680 --> 38:27.120\nIs there a movie question for me in the line?\n\n38:27.120 --> 38:28.120\nOkay.\n\n38:28.120 --> 38:29.120\nCan you come?\n\n38:29.120 --> 38:30.120\nOkay, Evan, thank you.\n\n38:30.120 --> 38:31.120\nI will eject.\n\n38:31.120 --> 38:32.120\nThat's not honorable.\n\n38:32.120 --> 38:34.120\nYou want to eject?\n\n38:34.120 --> 38:36.920\nThat sounds like the worst like thing to say during sex.\n\n38:36.920 --> 38:38.920\nNo, I want like, just eject.\n\n38:38.920 --> 38:40.920\nAll right, here it is.\n\n38:40.920 --> 38:45.960\nI saw you guys on the Massachusetts tour stop, so it's really cool to see it all finished.\n\n38:45.960 --> 38:49.320\nDid you know what the emotional premise or main storyline of the movie would be before\n\n38:49.320 --> 38:54.480\nduring shooting, or did you figure out the true focus during the editing process?\n\n38:54.480 --> 38:55.720\nThe latter, yes.\n\n38:55.720 --> 39:00.280\nWe went out, I met Dan on Thanksgiving of 2012.\n\n39:00.280 --> 39:05.720\nI shot my first Harmontown on December 3rd, and we hit the road on January 9th.\n\n39:05.720 --> 39:09.400\nI had never listened to a podcast until he emailed me.\n\n39:09.400 --> 39:12.240\nI hadn't talked to him very much.\n\n39:12.240 --> 39:15.720\nWe had, I had no idea what this movie would be about, totally honest.\n\n39:15.720 --> 39:19.280\nHe had an idea, I had an idea of what I think it should be.\n\n39:19.280 --> 39:22.960\nWe went out and we just chased story the whole time we were out there.\n\n39:22.960 --> 39:26.880\nWe looked for things, and halfway through we had an idea of what it might be about, but\n\n39:26.880 --> 39:31.520\nthere was a long editorial process that went through a lot of different stages, ups and\n\n39:31.520 --> 39:37.680\ndowns, and good stories, bad stories, good movies, and bad movies, and we came out.\n\n39:37.680 --> 39:42.360\nAnd Erin McGathy actually about Midway said, just make this movie about Spencer.\n\n39:42.360 --> 39:45.160\nAnd there is a cut that exists that is all about Spencer.\n\n39:45.160 --> 39:46.160\nBut that...\n\n39:46.160 --> 39:47.160\nDon't clap for that.\n\n39:47.160 --> 39:49.680\nYou'll never see it.\n\n39:49.680 --> 39:54.040\nSpencer's mom is here too, I guess.\n\n39:54.040 --> 39:58.480\nBut it triggered a lot of light bulbs went off when we made that cut.\n\n39:58.480 --> 40:01.280\nAnd it turned into the cut you saw today.\n\n40:01.280 --> 40:03.440\nBut no, it took a lot of editorial.\n\n40:03.440 --> 40:06.240\nAnd if I may, there are two guys, can I do a quick question?\n\n40:06.240 --> 40:07.240\nSure, sure.\n\n40:07.240 --> 40:08.240\nDo you mind?\n\n40:08.240 --> 40:09.240\nI'm sorry.\n\n40:09.240 --> 40:11.520\nThere are two guys in the audience that I failed to thank, and thank God this is being\n\n40:11.520 --> 40:16.200\npodcasted, but James Lesh is here tonight, he's an editor on this movie, who was with\n\n40:16.200 --> 40:23.640\nme the whole process, and Academy Award-winning Kevin Klobber, who cut Crossfire Hurricane,\n\n40:23.640 --> 40:24.640\nthe Pearl Jam doc.\n\n40:24.640 --> 40:29.160\nYou're just embarrassing this movie and the soon-to-be Kurt Cobain doc, he's a genius,\n\n40:29.160 --> 40:32.000\nand he's the reason that this movie exists.\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:37.120\nSo thank those guys.\n\n40:37.120 --> 40:39.680\nThank you.\n\n40:39.680 --> 40:43.800\nThis is a question for Spencer, but what do you decide is welcome by U3, should you have\n\n40:43.800 --> 40:44.800\nthem?\n\n40:44.800 --> 40:50.320\nI'm wondering, any chance of a Spencer podcast?\n\n40:50.320 --> 40:53.160\nDo you have any ideas?\n\n40:53.160 --> 40:55.960\nMaybe call it The Critten Den, I don't know, something like that.\n\n40:55.960 --> 40:56.960\nThe Critten Den.\n\n40:56.960 --> 40:57.960\nThat's a pretty good idea.\n\n40:57.960 --> 40:58.960\nI like it.\n\n40:58.960 --> 40:59.960\nI think you do kind of have an idea.\n\n40:59.960 --> 41:06.680\nI'm at more concept, I mean, that's a great title, but I don't know what I do, like I\n\n41:06.680 --> 41:07.680\njust sit and fart.\n\n41:07.680 --> 41:08.680\nAsk him.\n\n41:08.680 --> 41:09.680\nWhat do you do as a Crittenden?\n\n41:09.680 --> 41:10.680\nThat is what I ask him.\n\n41:10.680 --> 41:11.680\nHave we gotten that far?\n\n41:11.680 --> 41:12.680\nI'm sorry.\n\n41:12.680 --> 41:13.680\nAll right.\n\n41:13.680 --> 41:14.680\nWell, you and me, let's talk.\n\n41:14.680 --> 41:15.680\nWe can make it happen.\n\n41:15.680 --> 41:16.680\nOkay.\n\n41:16.680 --> 41:17.680\nThank you.\n\n41:17.680 --> 41:19.200\nIf anyone has a good idea, let me know.\n\n41:19.200 --> 41:21.680\nI'll do whatever anyone wants me to do.\n\n41:21.680 --> 41:28.320\nIt's part of the charm, I guess, like, I don't know what charm is.\n\n41:28.320 --> 41:32.440\nSomeone's been murdered and we're about to find out.\n\n41:32.440 --> 41:34.320\nThis question is for Spencer.\n\n41:34.320 --> 41:35.840\nI am cleaning up today.\n\n41:35.840 --> 41:39.120\nYes, this Q&A should be called, this question is for Spencer.\n\n41:39.120 --> 41:41.000\nI'm into it.\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:45.040\nThat would be the name of the documentary of tonight.\n\n41:45.040 --> 41:46.840\nI'm also a Dungeon Master.\n\n41:46.840 --> 41:47.840\nNice.\n\n41:47.840 --> 41:51.520\nI have a hard time, like, getting enough material for one day.\n\n41:51.520 --> 41:54.960\nHow are you able to make material for 20 straight days?\n\n41:54.960 --> 41:59.560\nWell, the trick is you only play for five minutes.\n\n41:59.560 --> 42:02.520\nWith a bunch of people who keep going, what am I doing?\n\n42:02.520 --> 42:03.520\nYeah.\n\n42:03.520 --> 42:10.600\nNo, I mean, honestly, I've learned to prepare less each week because, you know, if I was\n\n42:10.600 --> 42:15.880\nto say, let's plan out five hours, in the first hour, they're going to go into a house.\n\n42:15.880 --> 42:20.320\nYou know the first thing they're going to do is, like, shit on the house or turn it\n\n42:20.320 --> 42:24.440\ninto the warp zone or nothing that makes any sense.\n\n42:24.440 --> 42:29.000\nSo you just plan, like, one seed worth and then you have ideas of where you could go\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:30.000\nafter that.\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:31.520\nBut, you know, that's what I do.\n\n42:31.520 --> 42:36.360\nIt's different than preparing for, you know, your typical four hour session or whatever.\n\n42:36.360 --> 42:37.360\nThank you.\n\n42:37.360 --> 42:38.360\nThank you.\n\n42:38.360 --> 42:39.360\nHi.\n\n42:39.360 --> 42:40.360\nI'm Jeff.\n\n42:40.360 --> 42:44.720\nI want to know, is there going to be a Harmontown tour, too?\n\n42:44.720 --> 42:45.720\nPart two.\n\n42:45.720 --> 42:46.720\nI don't know.\n\n42:46.720 --> 42:49.000\nWe'll be making that decision these days, I guess.\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:50.600\nI mean, this is certainly exhilarating.\n\n42:50.600 --> 42:53.880\nI'm sure there's a lot of people in the audience right now that want to kill themselves, but\n\n42:53.880 --> 43:00.360\nI'm having a great time and the seats are full and the movie is well received, so it might\n\n43:00.360 --> 43:02.080\nmake an obvious choice to, like, go.\n\n43:02.080 --> 43:05.520\nI always thought, we'll call the first one Harmontown.\n\n43:05.520 --> 43:08.480\nYou're looking at me like I'm going to be involved, like, I'm on board.\n\n43:08.480 --> 43:09.480\nWhat am I going to do?\n\n43:09.480 --> 43:10.480\nNo, no.\n\n43:10.480 --> 43:12.480\nOh, you're, because you're like, I'll be, I'll be doing a documentary.\n\n43:12.480 --> 43:15.320\nNo, I'm saying, I didn't know you would actually look at me saying, how are we doing\n\n43:15.320 --> 43:16.320\nit?\n\n43:16.320 --> 43:19.440\nOh, I, yeah, I, there should be a number, there should be several.\n\n43:19.440 --> 43:20.440\nThis is a special thing.\n\n43:20.440 --> 43:21.880\nIt's, I like this, I like this thing.\n\n43:21.880 --> 43:22.880\nI like what's going on.\n\n43:22.880 --> 43:23.880\nWe'll do, we'll do Harmon World.\n\n43:23.880 --> 43:28.160\nWe'll go to Edinburgh and, like, tell the things that people are always, you know, tweeting\n\n43:28.160 --> 43:32.360\nat us, like, how can we never come to such a place worldwide, but whatever, I mean, I\n\n43:32.360 --> 43:33.360\ndon't know.\n\n43:33.360 --> 43:34.360\nYes.\n\n43:34.360 --> 43:37.360\nAnd then I, I have another question, I'm sorry.\n\n43:37.360 --> 43:38.360\nI mean, it's fine.\n\n43:38.360 --> 43:39.360\nGo ahead.\n\n43:39.360 --> 43:42.640\nIt's the president that's been, all this has edited out.\n\n43:42.640 --> 43:45.680\nThis is all just a Q and A. It's like in a fucking archive.\n\n43:45.680 --> 43:46.680\nThat's it.\n\n43:46.680 --> 43:48.360\nWho is Spencer Crittenden?\n\n43:48.360 --> 43:50.360\nOh, shit.\n\n43:50.360 --> 43:53.880\nWho's that question to?\n\n43:53.880 --> 43:54.880\nAll of you.\n\n43:54.880 --> 43:55.880\nOh, shit.\n\n43:55.880 --> 43:58.680\nI think he's Hitler.\n\n43:58.680 --> 44:03.080\nYeah, this is like, this is a long con.\n\n44:03.080 --> 44:04.080\nYeah.\n\n44:04.080 --> 44:07.200\nIf you, if you get to, if you ask me, I get to answer how I want to answer.\n\n44:07.200 --> 44:08.400\nI think he's Hitler.\n\n44:08.400 --> 44:09.400\nHmm.\n\n44:09.400 --> 44:10.400\nHmm.\n\n44:10.400 --> 44:11.400\nBearded Hitler.\n\n44:11.400 --> 44:13.960\nI think, I think this is how Hitler started.\n\n44:13.960 --> 44:15.960\nSeveral good points being raised.\n\n44:15.960 --> 44:21.160\nI mean, Hitler was like at a Nazi show.\n\n44:21.160 --> 44:24.120\nHe was like, I could be Dungeon Master.\n\n44:24.120 --> 44:25.120\nYeah.\n\n44:25.120 --> 44:29.640\nI'm like, Joe, oh, help fun with you and the thing.\n\n44:29.640 --> 44:30.640\nYeah.\n\n44:30.640 --> 44:31.640\nI don't know.\n\n44:31.640 --> 44:34.400\nThat is a spot on Hitler, by the way.\n\n44:34.400 --> 44:35.400\nThank you.\n\n44:35.400 --> 44:36.400\nHere's Hitler.\n\n44:36.400 --> 44:37.640\nHere's Hitler as your plumber.\n\n44:37.640 --> 44:43.640\nOh, it seems like you'll have his toilet.\n\n44:43.640 --> 44:47.280\nAll right.\n\n44:47.280 --> 44:48.280\nThank you.\n\n44:48.280 --> 44:50.640\nI'm the last person who knows who I am.\n\n44:50.640 --> 44:51.640\nWho are you?\n\n44:51.640 --> 44:52.640\nI'm the last person.\n\n44:52.640 --> 44:53.640\nJust say it.\n\n44:53.640 --> 44:55.360\nWhat is that?\n\n44:55.360 --> 44:56.360\nWhat does that even mean?\n\n44:56.360 --> 44:57.360\nWell, say it.\n\n44:57.360 --> 44:59.200\nYou know you're thinking like Ewan McGregor.\n\n44:59.200 --> 45:02.200\nWho's Ewan McGregor?\n\n45:02.200 --> 45:03.200\nWho's Ewan McGregor?\n\n45:03.200 --> 45:04.200\nWho's Ewan McGregor?\n\n45:04.200 --> 45:06.200\nAre you fucking, fucking me right now?\n\n45:06.200 --> 45:08.200\nIs that like Ewan McGregor?\n\n45:08.200 --> 45:09.200\nIt's, what?\n\n45:09.200 --> 45:10.200\nWhat?\n\n45:10.200 --> 45:11.200\nWhat?\n\n45:11.200 --> 45:12.200\nEwan?\n\n45:12.200 --> 45:13.200\nEwan?\n\n45:13.200 --> 45:15.640\nYou've seen his name in print and you think his name is Ewan McGregor?\n\n45:15.640 --> 45:17.640\nWell, they're brothers, right?\n\n45:17.640 --> 45:18.640\nNo.\n\n45:18.640 --> 45:21.240\nThere's Ewan McGregor and he's one person.\n\n45:21.240 --> 45:24.360\nI thought it was Ewan and Ewing, like Patrick Ewing?\n\n45:24.360 --> 45:25.360\nEwing McGregor.\n\n45:25.360 --> 45:27.720\nHe's not, he's doing a bit.\n\n45:27.720 --> 45:28.720\nWhat?\n\n45:28.720 --> 45:29.720\nWho's Ewan McGregor?\n\n45:29.720 --> 45:30.720\nWho's Ewan McGregor?\n\n45:30.720 --> 45:31.720\nYeah.\n\n45:31.720 --> 45:32.720\nHe's an actor.\n\n45:32.720 --> 45:34.560\nOh, well, fuck, who cares?\n\n45:34.560 --> 45:35.560\nHe lies?\n\n45:35.560 --> 45:39.520\nA lot of people lie.\n\n45:39.520 --> 45:42.040\nYou, you really don't know who Ewan McGregor is.\n\n45:42.040 --> 45:43.840\nI don't care who actors are.\n\n45:43.840 --> 45:46.800\nWhat's important is the person that they're pretending to be, right?\n\n45:46.800 --> 45:47.800\nNot who they are.\n\n45:47.800 --> 45:49.800\nOkay, so you like Obi-Wan?\n\n45:49.800 --> 45:50.800\nObi-Wan Kenobi.\n\n45:50.800 --> 45:51.800\nWho?\n\n45:51.800 --> 45:52.800\nThe real person.\n\n45:52.800 --> 45:53.800\nObi-Wan.\n\n45:53.800 --> 45:54.800\nOh, Obi-Wan.\n\n45:54.800 --> 45:55.800\nIt's from Star Wars.\n\n45:55.800 --> 45:56.800\nObi-Wan.\n\n45:56.800 --> 45:57.800\nObi-Wan, yeah.\n\n45:57.800 --> 45:58.800\nI read the novelizations.\n\n45:58.800 --> 45:59.800\nI read the novelizations.\n\n45:59.800 --> 46:00.800\nSee, is all the pronunciations wrong?\n\n46:00.800 --> 46:01.800\nThat's a great bet.\n\n46:01.800 --> 46:02.800\nAre two G2.\n\n46:02.800 --> 46:03.800\nThat would be, are two.\n\n46:03.800 --> 46:04.800\nThat is, that would be so funny.\n\n46:04.800 --> 46:05.800\nYou didn't know how to pronounce R2G2.\n\n46:05.800 --> 46:06.800\nYeah.\n\n46:06.800 --> 46:19.800\nIt's a, it's a sketch is someone's recounting Star Wars and they've only read the books.\n\n46:19.800 --> 46:24.960\nI went to school with a guy, sorry.\n\n46:24.960 --> 46:30.520\nI went to school with a guy named R2G2, R2G2 Gonzalez.\n\n46:30.520 --> 46:34.040\nHis parents named it after their favorite character from the Star Wars movie.\n\n46:34.040 --> 46:35.040\nShut up.\n\n46:35.040 --> 46:36.040\nAre you getting out?\n\n46:36.040 --> 46:37.040\nGonzalez, R2G2.\n\n46:37.040 --> 46:38.520\nYou didn't have a friend named R2G2.\n\n46:38.520 --> 46:39.520\nI didn't have a friend.\n\n46:39.520 --> 46:41.720\nHe went to my school.\n\n46:41.720 --> 46:43.400\nHis name was R2G2 for real.\n\n46:43.400 --> 46:44.800\nR2G2 Gonzalez, yeah.\n\n46:44.800 --> 46:45.800\nFor real.\n\n46:45.800 --> 46:46.800\nYeah.\n\n46:46.800 --> 46:54.800\nI spelled A-R-T-O-O, A-R-T-O-R, I don't know how to spell the D2 part of it, I'm not going\n\n46:54.800 --> 46:55.800\nto lie.\n\n46:55.800 --> 46:56.800\nI'll just go with R2.\n\n46:56.800 --> 46:57.800\nGonzalez.\n\n46:57.800 --> 46:58.800\nGonzalez.\n\n46:58.800 --> 47:02.800\nI'm so excited right now.\n\n47:02.800 --> 47:03.800\nOh, no.\n\n47:03.800 --> 47:04.800\nThat's R2RO.\n\n47:04.800 --> 47:05.800\nIs it R2RO?\n\n47:05.800 --> 47:06.800\nGonzalez?\n\n47:06.800 --> 47:09.240\nWell, obviously that's going to have a better Google ranking.\n\n47:09.240 --> 47:11.800\nI mean, that's how the search engine works.\n\n47:11.800 --> 47:12.800\nR2G2.\n\n47:12.800 --> 47:20.800\nYou type in R2G2 and it what comes up to Autofill is Dan Harmon Chevy Chase fired NBC.\n\n47:20.800 --> 47:27.800\nAll right, there is an R2G2, okay, there is a person named R2G2.\n\n47:27.800 --> 47:29.800\nYeah, that's all I'm saying.\n\n47:29.800 --> 47:33.800\nIt's not that big of a, you know, coincidence.\n\n47:33.800 --> 47:36.800\nHis last name is Valterra Phenomenon.\n\n47:36.800 --> 47:38.800\nAll right, so this happens.\n\n47:38.800 --> 47:39.800\nIt really is.\n\n47:39.800 --> 47:40.800\nThis is adorable.\n\n47:40.800 --> 47:43.800\nThis is a young, sexy John Hodgeman.\n\n47:43.800 --> 47:47.800\nSo this question is for the three of you.\n\n47:47.800 --> 47:51.800\nWas there ever a point in time during the tour where a personality's clashed or something\n\n47:51.800 --> 47:55.800\nhappened where you just wanted to turn it around and stop the thing?\n\n47:55.800 --> 47:56.800\nNo, no.\n\n47:56.800 --> 47:59.800\nThat was the weird, the weirdest thing was we left thinking we're going to get tired.\n\n47:59.800 --> 48:00.800\nWe're going to get bored.\n\n48:00.800 --> 48:02.800\nWe're going to get over this so soon.\n\n48:02.800 --> 48:04.800\nBut none of that happened.\n\n48:04.800 --> 48:08.800\nBeing on a tour bus for 20 days is really, really fun.\n\n48:08.800 --> 48:10.800\nYou have a good time.\n\n48:10.800 --> 48:11.800\nYou have the best sleep of your life.\n\n48:11.800 --> 48:12.800\nYou laugh the whole time.\n\n48:12.800 --> 48:13.800\nIt's amazing.\n\n48:13.800 --> 48:14.800\nYeah, it was fun.\n\n48:14.800 --> 48:16.800\nIf Erin were here, I think she would want it on record.\n\n48:16.800 --> 48:18.800\nIt's like, no, it's fucking miserable.\n\n48:18.800 --> 48:23.800\nFor a relationship, to get on that, to go into that situation with the person you love\n\n48:23.800 --> 48:29.800\nwith your life partner, like that is not fair to the relationship.\n\n48:29.800 --> 48:34.800\nEvery individual can get to choose whether to have a good time on that bus.\n\n48:34.800 --> 48:40.800\nBut our relationship was definitely just, it was fine.\n\n48:40.800 --> 48:44.800\nWe survived it, and we knew going in it would be stressful.\n\n48:44.800 --> 48:51.800\nBut it was like, there's cameras everywhere, and Erin loves documentaries and is really\n\n48:51.800 --> 48:57.800\nsmart, and is the reason I contacted Neil, because Erin was the one watching Wayne White\n\n48:57.800 --> 48:59.800\nin Beauty is Embarrassing.\n\n48:59.800 --> 49:04.800\nErin is the one who's going like, I don't, you know, I just, I want to support you in\n\n49:04.800 --> 49:05.800\nyour documentary.\n\n49:05.800 --> 49:06.800\nI don't want to look bad.\n\n49:06.800 --> 49:08.800\nI don't want to do other things.\n\n49:08.800 --> 49:13.800\nShe's going into it thinking all this stuff, and I'm like, it's just, don't worry about\n\n49:13.800 --> 49:14.800\nit.\n\n49:14.800 --> 49:15.800\nLet's just have fun.\n\n49:15.800 --> 49:16.800\nIt was a nightmare.\n\n49:16.800 --> 49:22.800\nIt was like, you can see the things that reality shows do to crazy people that they cast because\n\n49:22.800 --> 49:26.800\nthey're crazy, and then they put them on TV, and they go like, oh, there's cameras everywhere,\n\n49:26.800 --> 49:27.800\nbut just act natural.\n\n49:27.800 --> 49:29.800\nThey like to watch them unwind.\n\n49:29.800 --> 49:34.800\nIf you're in a relationship and you go get on a tour bus with cameras everywhere, it'll,\n\n49:34.800 --> 49:38.800\nI think it'll, it'll find the nooks and crannies of your, of your relationship.\n\n49:38.800 --> 49:41.800\nYeah, you're going to get a Seaworth subplot.\n\n49:41.800 --> 49:47.800\nAnd it was my fault, because, yeah, I brought work on the bus and all that stuff, but like,\n\n49:47.800 --> 49:52.800\nit was actually, because I think like, oh man, that was fun, but Erin's like, it was a nightmare,\n\n49:52.800 --> 49:54.800\nand she's right when I look back on it.\n\n49:54.800 --> 49:56.800\nIt was a nightmare for her.\n\n49:56.800 --> 49:57.800\nThank you.\n\n49:57.800 --> 49:58.800\nThank you.\n\n49:58.800 --> 49:59.800\nHello.\n\n49:59.800 --> 50:01.800\nI enjoyed your documentary very much.\n\n50:01.800 --> 50:05.800\nI just wanted to ask, during the course of it, I noticed a pervasive use of alcohol,\n\n50:05.800 --> 50:09.800\nand I wanted to know how real was that, or were there any…\n\n50:09.800 --> 50:10.800\nHave you seen…\n\n50:10.800 --> 50:11.800\nThat was water.\n\n50:11.800 --> 50:12.800\nIt was all fake.\n\n50:12.800 --> 50:13.800\nHow did these water…\n\n50:13.800 --> 50:15.800\nWere there any interventions at any point, or…\n\n50:15.800 --> 50:19.800\nHave you seen the comically huge bottle that Dan brought on stage?\n\n50:19.800 --> 50:25.800\nNo, yeah, I drink a lot, and if anyone asks if I'm an alcoholic, I just say yes, because\n\n50:25.800 --> 50:28.800\nthat makes the conversation stop.\n\n50:28.800 --> 50:30.800\nThank you for your question.\n\n50:30.800 --> 50:33.800\nIf you say no, then they get to keep talking, so…\n\n50:33.800 --> 50:35.800\nI also do the same with racism.\n\n50:35.800 --> 50:37.800\nAnd what happened with the moonshine?\n\n50:37.800 --> 50:39.800\nWhat happened with the moonshine?\n\n50:39.800 --> 50:41.800\nOh my God, he's going to kill us.\n\n50:41.800 --> 50:42.800\nWhere are you going?\n\n50:42.800 --> 50:43.800\nOh, he's sitting here.\n\n50:43.800 --> 50:44.800\nOh, God.\n\n50:44.800 --> 50:46.800\nI thought, because you were like, what happened with the moonshine?\n\n50:46.800 --> 50:48.800\nAre you strutted?\n\n50:48.800 --> 50:51.800\nI think you saw what happened with the moonshine.\n\n50:51.800 --> 50:53.800\nYeah, the moonshine was a blackout drunk.\n\n50:53.800 --> 50:55.800\nI mean, you can hear that podcast.\n\n50:55.800 --> 50:57.800\nI did do a lot of edits to that podcast.\n\n50:57.800 --> 51:01.800\nThere's actually stuff from the movie that I edited out of the podcast, but you can\n\n51:01.800 --> 51:03.800\nby and large hear that episode.\n\n51:03.800 --> 51:04.800\nIt's Nashville.\n\n51:04.800 --> 51:05.800\nYou can go back and look for it.\n\n51:05.800 --> 51:06.800\nThat's what happened, yeah.\n\n51:06.800 --> 51:07.800\nWhat you saw was what happened.\n\n51:07.800 --> 51:08.800\nIt's pretty crazy.\n\n51:08.800 --> 51:11.800\nAt one point, I took the audience on a bear hunt.\n\n51:11.800 --> 51:13.800\nOh, that got cut out completely.\n\n51:13.800 --> 51:14.800\nThat was in several edits, but…\n\n51:14.800 --> 51:15.800\nBecause I regressed to…\n\n51:15.800 --> 51:16.800\nOh, man.\n\n51:16.800 --> 51:18.800\nI didn't like that bear hunt.\n\n51:18.800 --> 51:24.800\nIt was a full-on blackout, crazy warning sign.\n\n51:24.800 --> 51:25.800\nThank you.\n\n51:25.800 --> 51:26.800\nYou're welcome.\n\n51:26.800 --> 51:27.800\nYou're welcome.\n\n51:27.800 --> 51:28.800\nI mean, it's weird that…\n\n51:28.800 --> 51:29.800\nOkay.\n\n51:29.800 --> 51:31.800\nHow's it going?\n\n51:31.800 --> 51:37.800\nI mean, you know, when you say goodbye to a friend and then keep walking to the party.\n\n51:37.800 --> 51:39.800\nYou go to the party.\n\n51:39.800 --> 51:40.800\nSame corner.\n\n51:40.800 --> 51:41.800\nI hate that.\n\n51:41.800 --> 51:43.800\nLike, I'd rather die than be alive.\n\n51:43.800 --> 51:44.800\nHey, Seek.\n\n51:44.800 --> 51:45.800\nIt's Seek.\n\n51:45.800 --> 51:46.800\nSeek from the podcast.\n\n51:46.800 --> 51:53.800\nMultiple aneurysm survivors, Seek.\n\n51:53.800 --> 51:56.800\nFirst of all, Neil, you made an amazing movie.\n\n51:56.800 --> 52:00.800\nThis is my second time seeing it, and I still got emotional and cried.\n\n52:00.800 --> 52:04.800\nAnd I think you guys represent not only, you know, being honest to the whole movie,\n\n52:04.800 --> 52:06.800\nbut represent us really well.\n\n52:06.800 --> 52:07.800\nAnd I thank you guys for that.\n\n52:07.800 --> 52:08.800\nThank you, Seek.\n\n52:08.800 --> 52:09.800\nThank you very much.\n\n52:09.800 --> 52:10.800\nIt's very nice of you to say.\n\n52:10.800 --> 52:11.800\nThank you.\n\n52:11.800 --> 52:14.800\nI want to know now that the movie's over and some time has passed.\n\n52:14.800 --> 52:17.800\nAnd they would say, you know, hindsight is 20-20.\n\n52:17.800 --> 52:21.800\nLike, is there anything from the movie, like watching it now multiple times with audiences\n\n52:21.800 --> 52:24.800\nthat you're learning or seeing differently?\n\n52:24.800 --> 52:28.800\nLike, Spencer, do you still get depressed even when good things and bad things happen?\n\n52:28.800 --> 52:31.800\nYeah, I'm depressed right now, actually.\n\n52:31.800 --> 52:32.800\nIt's…\n\n52:32.800 --> 52:34.800\nYeah, I'm going to be fine, you guys.\n\n52:34.800 --> 52:36.800\nAlso, hire a merch intern.\n\n52:36.800 --> 52:39.800\nLike, fucking make someone else deal with that.\n\n52:39.800 --> 52:42.800\nI told Aaron over and over again.\n\n52:42.800 --> 52:43.800\nDon't do merch.\n\n52:43.800 --> 52:45.800\nThat was not a lesson you learned.\n\n52:45.800 --> 52:48.800\nThat was a lesson everyone else but you learned.\n\n52:52.800 --> 52:53.800\nOr also, don't do merch.\n\n52:53.800 --> 52:56.800\nIt's not like that's how Adam Sandler makes his money.\n\n52:56.800 --> 52:58.800\nHe makes billion-dollar movies that everyone's like,\n\n52:58.800 --> 53:00.800\nhe doesn't give a shit about t-shirts.\n\n53:00.800 --> 53:03.800\nLike, somebody sells a t-shirt with Adam Sandler's face.\n\n53:03.800 --> 53:05.800\nIt's like, it's bootlegged.\n\n53:05.800 --> 53:08.800\nIf I can speak for the fans, if I was in another town and you guys came,\n\n53:08.800 --> 53:10.800\nthat's cool that you guys had merch.\n\n53:10.800 --> 53:12.800\nYeah, hire an intern.\n\n53:12.800 --> 53:14.800\nI'm going to be high-roaded.\n\n53:14.800 --> 53:18.800\nWait, there were 7,000 t-shirts.\n\n53:18.800 --> 53:21.800\nThe amount of merch was unbelievable.\n\n53:21.800 --> 53:23.800\nLike, there's one shot of it in the beginning\n\n53:23.800 --> 53:25.800\nwhere there's lines of garbage bags.\n\n53:25.800 --> 53:26.800\nThose are filled with t-shirts.\n\n53:26.800 --> 53:27.800\nAnd we sold all of it.\n\n53:27.800 --> 53:28.800\nNo, we did not.\n\n53:28.800 --> 53:29.800\nI know.\n\n53:29.800 --> 53:31.800\nWe didn't sell like half of it.\n\n53:31.800 --> 53:34.800\nGet your Harmon Down t-shirt.\n\n53:34.800 --> 53:37.800\nI want everyone listening to me to understand something about t-shirts.\n\n53:37.800 --> 53:39.800\nThey're very easy to print.\n\n53:39.800 --> 53:41.800\nThey're very easy to sell.\n\n53:41.800 --> 53:43.800\nEveryone can always use them.\n\n53:43.800 --> 53:47.800\nThey're a fantastic way to communicate, to express yourself,\n\n53:47.800 --> 53:49.800\nto exchange in commerce.\n\n53:49.800 --> 53:52.800\nThe amount of money you make on t-shirts\n\n53:52.800 --> 53:56.800\nwill always just give you enough money to make more t-shirts.\n\n53:56.800 --> 53:59.800\nThere is nothing, there isn't anyone out there right now\n\n53:59.800 --> 54:02.800\nwho's like, and then I got the t-shirt business.\n\n54:02.800 --> 54:05.800\nThere's no Howard Hughes of t-shirtery.\n\n54:05.800 --> 54:08.800\nWell, other than our friend Ryan Ridley who lived off of a t-shirt\n\n54:08.800 --> 54:11.800\nfrom two years.

Let him answer you need to get it out\n\n01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:27.600\nNo, you need to get out. I like I'm staying you need to get out\n\n01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.400\nNow no\n\n01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.480\nNo\n\n01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:38.640\nMy favorite part is that you're looking into the rear view mirror when you're doing that. Yeah, that is great object work\n\n01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:46.480\nYou need to get out. He gots to go. Um, have you got to kick anyone out?\n\n01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.240\nI haven't had a bad experience yet. All right, what what's the lowest rate you give?\n\n01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:57.200\nPassengers ratings. I have a 4.8. Why do you think I don't even know I have a 4.7 rating\n\n01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.320\nI don't know why let's change that tonight. Do you do you give passengers fives like all the time?\n\n01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:09.640\nYeah, yeah, have you ever given not a five to anybody? No, no, yeah, never. I figure how do you feel that that like\n\n01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.160\nundermines the whole concept of a star rating system because\n\n01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:18.320\nIf fives are the only one that anyone's choosing it's kind of like you're just choosing zeros\n\n01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.040\nWell\n\n01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:28.480\nAll all businesses have this problem. It's a real issue where you have to give them one of the top businesses\n\n01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:34.280\nThat have this problem, you know, I'd say Apple Incorporated does a really good job with it\n\n01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:40.160\nBut you know for instance borders tried it for a while. You saw how that goes Barnes and Noble didn't as it happens\n\n01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:45.320\nWell, Apple Apple's doing so good. How come you because they don't focus on only the 9s and 10s\n\n01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:48.160\nThat's what everyone does. They're like if it's a 9 or 10, it's fine\n\n01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:53.620\nOtherwise, you're fired and that's not constructive because sometimes you only get a C and that's great\n\n01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.720\nWhat are you supposed to do look at the\n\n01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:02.760\nThe fives and go like you look at the threes and you go like oh these guys what went wrong and then you fix it\n\n01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.680\nme I'll be on the\n\n01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:11.440\nBut also like you you worked under that regime and now you work now you you left them you bailed\n\n01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:14.200\nUh-huh, I waved a dollar in your face\n\n01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:21.600\nAnd you were like fuck this Apple business. Uh-huh Steve Jobs. Yeah, he used to work at Apple\n\n01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.880\nI used to work at Apple works with Dan\n\n01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.880\nSorry\n\n01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:31.320\nWe're leaving RJ out. Sorry. Sorry RJ. Is this the worst of the best pockets episode? Okay. All right\n\n01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:38.880\nBut let's I just want to make sure we really really kick it into RJ. Do you believe in God?\n\n01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.760\nYes\n\n01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:46.280\nWhat do you what do you think God is like do you think it's like do you think it was it would be something that you\n\n01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:53.400\nCould see or do you is God personal to you or do you believe in a God that you think is like able to like\n\n01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:59.320\nDo you do you think that God is the same from one person to the next or do you think God is personal to you?\n\n01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:09.640\nYou can take as long as you want for truthfully that's not supposed to be an instant answer. No, he gets paid by the\n\n01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:13.280\nHe can't take the as long as he wants\n\n01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:17.240\nFor this right is the meter running\n\n01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:24.120\nYes, the meter is running. I said I haven't started. Yeah, no, no, you're starting. It started. You'll do please\n\n01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:30.320\nLike you can think as long as you want and then start the meter I\n\n01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:37.320\nGuess it's personal to me. Yeah, like it's between you and the unknown\n\n01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.800\nAll right, that's the right answer. I can see\n\n01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:48.400\nI'm sorry, you're right. I feel like people should understand that religion is like it's like a thing\n\n01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.040\nIt's like it's not it's not other people's business. It should have a small case are\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.280\nBut not to mean that it's not important. It's the most important thing in the world\n\n01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:01.000\nIt's like shoes or pants. You don't fucking wear pants that fit other people. No\n\n01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.840\nYou pick and shoes\n\n01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:12.040\nSame with shoes. You don't wear shoes. We have been trained in our society to think that religion is somehow\n\n01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.920\nthe domain of idiots\n\n01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.880\nfundamentalists people who\n\n01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:23.680\nDecided things and if we think about religion we decide things about ourselves and we have to pick something\n\n01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:29.440\nLike we don't we we sit and we talk about this TV shows good, but I only like this part\n\n01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.760\nI like the Shakira song, but I only like the bridge and I actually think I like her influence on this and we we pick\n\n01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:40.800\nAnd choose we mythologize our consumption about everything except for the most important thing in the world to primates since\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.360\nThunder clapped and lightning hit our monkey friend religion\n\n01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:49.320\nWhy do we die? Why does the universe not give a fuck about us?\n\n01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:54.960\nIt's like an important thing and we let me and we let it sit and we got like well my parents were Lutheran\n\n01:20:54.960 --> 01:21:01.640\nSo I guess don't give a fuck about that. It's religion. It's like one man's business between you and the unknown\n\n01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.520\nGod damn it. I'm great\n\n01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.360\nI wish the wind is the world gonna catch up I\n\n01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:17.640\nThink look at all these people here. No, they're all right\n\n01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:22.960\nThey're good people. Yeah, I just want to make this a good podcast\n\n01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:27.080\nI'm gonna go beyond that. That was an easy shot\n\n01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.520\nHas anyone in the room ever stolen anything? Oh\n\n01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.120\nRJ has\n\n01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:42.680\nOkay, let's start with RJ. Let's start with RJ. Are you are you are you willing to talk about it?\n\n01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:45.280\nWhat do you stole something? What do you steal?\n\n01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:52.520\nYou don't have to talk. You're not gonna get caught. How many arches could there be running uber in Los Feliz?\n\n01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:58.600\nThanks, it's still money for my parents. Oh, that's fine. I did that too. Yeah\n\n01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:05.120\nNo one's gonna press charges just like out of their purses and wallets and stuff. No eat like mug. Yeah\n\n01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.880\nTo get what like son\n\n01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:17.760\nWhat did you need so bad? I remember the one is all stickers and like just the most random shit\n\n01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:22.360\nLike what did you need so bad that you would go into your parents room and like I was just mad at them\n\n01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:27.120\nSo I try to get back at them by stealing money. Well, you did what did you buy with a cigarette sir?\n\n01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:31.200\nWhat food? Oh food revenge is what he bought\n\n01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:34.960\nNow the revenge was free\n\n01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:42.240\nHaha, who's who's got who's who who stole something that they think is genuinely\n\n01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:46.200\nYeah, what what I like is that this dude's raising his hand and the guy next to him is pointing at\n\n01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:51.120\nHe's like believe me. I've heard about this. He stole it for me. I know it was great\n\n01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.640\nWould you would you come up and tell us about the thing you stole?\n\n01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.200\nYou didn't feel it from the gentleman, right? I\n\n01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:04.120\nStole a baby. It's for someone here. Oh shit. Okay. It's the guy next to me\n\n01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.120\nHe's like he's my life force\n\n01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:11.320\nSo I'm a huge community fan, I'm a huge community fan\n\n01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:20.160\nAnd I was lucky enough to find myself with unsupervised access to what yeah to to the set one day and so\n\n01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:29.560\nTo take advantage of that or to show my thanks for that I took a community pendant off the wall\n\n01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.440\nand at some point\n\n01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:38.600\nfurther on at Channel 101 I had you sign it and and got it okayed with you that I had taken it\n\n01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:43.780\nIt's like a poster on the wall or it was a pendant. It's what's a pendant. It's like the triangle flag\n\n01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:52.760\nSorry, okay. All right. Yeah, and it has the old community logo with the flag draped without wings\n\n01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:56.200\nThat's cool. Yeah, pretty sure a prop guy was fired for losing\n\n01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:03.000\nNo, I would say I two years ago. I would be like you did what to my sacred temple\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:09.240\nBut then like like every I found out every season Sony just fucking shovels that shit into an incinerator\n\n01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:17.000\nSo we got to make room for the good wife for Shark Tank or whatever like they're like that's gonna cost eight dollars to store this\n\n01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:23.200\nWe don't let's get rid of these frogs some breros and shit that I would have I would have fucking taken\n\n01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:31.760\nEverything everything what that's British shoe from the British shoe episode. I know we burnt that that was worth more as ash\n\n01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.200\nWe powered a train\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.080\nFilled with Whitney Houston's greatest hits\n\n01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:43.200\nAfter her death, we needed to get those to the record store really quickly\n\n01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:49.120\nSo we set fire to your set in the furnace on the Sony train\n\n01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:57.320\nIt's a you everything you did everything you dedicated your life to it's more valuable. It's steam\n\n01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:01.600\nSo good job getting that pendant out of there\n\n01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:06.080\nI'm just glad I stole the Troy and Abed dolls from the Christmas episode\n\n01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:10.680\nI'm scondid with those the other ones are melting into the second\n\n01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:13.520\nsidewalk somewhere Sony train somewhere\n\n01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:20.360\nAnybody else told something big crazy still stole something weird.

Yeah, there you go\n\n01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:26.100\nOkay, first. Let me justify it by saying I was a lot younger and I was homeless\n\n01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:29.340\nBut I used to go\n\n01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:37.260\nOh, like about 19 18 we're all agreeing in advance to reward your candor because we asked you to tell us about something\n\n01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:42.020\nYou stole we're not we're not asking you to tell us about something. You're proud of like so if this is shameful\n\n01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:44.180\nWe we love it all the more\n\n01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:53.020\nI used to go to bars with a fake ID and I'd steal women's purses and then take them to the bathroom and\n\n01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:56.000\nTake their wallets out and take their money\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.200\nThat's a pretty real one. That's not a pennant off a wall\n\n01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nYou were at a stage in your life when you were homeless and you were going to bar and so you were just this is how you were living\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.980\nYou were going to bars and you would just go, you know what would you would you I'm curious about this\n\n01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:23.640\nWould you pick and choose who you would victimize? Would you go that that person deserves?\n\n01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:27.720\nEveryone if you try to engage them in conversation like what do you how do you feel about black people?\n\n01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.720\nTaking your wallet\n\n01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:42.480\nAll right, so you did there was a sense of karmic like justice in your head\n\n01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:55.280\nWell, yes, there was that but but having decided that you were going to do that carnivorously you then also the human achievement is that\n\n01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:58.480\nWhereas a fox would just eat a fucking baby good gazelle\n\n01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:06.000\nLike it wouldn't go like oh that gazelle deserves this it's got a gazelle's racist like like when humans cannibalize each other\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.880\nWe still have this compulsion to go. Oh this person deserves it\n\n01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:15.040\nYou know like prisoners get so excited about pedophiles wait. You're a pedophile. I get to rape you\n\n01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:21.640\nI'm so excited about rape now. I got a reason. Oh boy\n\n01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.120\nYeah, that's exactly right actually\n\n01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:32.040\nWhat was your biggest haul? What was the most money you ever got out of a purse?\n\n01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:39.840\n$500 did you ever get caught or get it get close to being caught?\n\n01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:44.080\nSounds like you're pretty thorough about a pretty profession\n\n01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:49.640\nWhat awesome a lot of things, but that was probably the worst\n\n01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:52.080\nI've stolen like from parties and\n\n01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:56.680\nLike stores and stuff, but that was like the most personal\n\n01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:04.240\nIt seems like if you're you're you're willing to share this it seems like maybe you're like this was a transition in your life\n\n01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.520\nYou were I definitely I got my karma. I mean oh\n\n01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:13.600\nWhat what happened for the podcast listeners? She's she's rolled down the aisle in a wheelchair\n\n01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:15.880\nShe's sharing this I didn't think to share this\n\n01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:24.760\nWhat what do you mean you get sick? I got a rare illness called Ehlers-Danlos and\n\n01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:29.000\nMy joints dislocate as I try and walk\n\n01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:33.760\nSo now I have to use a wheelchair and you look back on it and think oh well\n\n01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:36.440\nI was a bad person. I deserve this which you probably shouldn't\n\n01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:43.520\nNo, I don't not that much but if a karma if there is really karma, I mean that's that's nice of you\n\n01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:46.880\nTo take that responsibility to do that\n\n01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:49.440\nI think that there's probably people in the room who\n\n01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.920\nWho don't end up suffering misfortune who probably did a lot of shitty stuff much worth things\n\n01:29:54.920 --> 01:30:01.400\nI mean, I don't know if it's helpful for you to like think that like random stuff can happen to you\n\n01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:04.760\nYeah, it doesn't have to have to do with whether or not you're a good or bad person\n\n01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:10.920\nIt's like that might that might that might not be helpful to you, but I mean, it's it's a\n\n01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.080\nlike\n\n01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:20.240\nLike I have like a million questions for you. Like you you so you wait. Why were you homeless? Like what was there?\n\n01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:24.520\nI was really rebellious and I\n\n01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:31.840\nRan away from home a lot when I was a teenager and where did you live if we can ask that we're in the country\n\n01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:33.760\nCalifornia California\n\n01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:39.240\nAnd my parents just cut the stick of it and they were showing me tough love and they weren't letting me come back\n\n01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:41.560\nRight. How old were you at that point?\n\n01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:45.120\nYeah, I remember my brother like\n\n01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:51.800\nTangled with drugs and stuff is just smoking weed and stuff and my parents were like, ah, you need help like sometimes\n\n01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:58.880\nYeah, parents are trying to like they don't know how to be parents and they're like, ah, you get you're you're a fuck-up kid\n\n01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:01.400\nLike I'm being a bad parent. So now you're gonna\n\n01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.400\nI\n\n01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:05.960\nConnected with them\n\n01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.640\nOkay, oh, yeah, your parents live in California\n\n01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.960\nWhat's a what is this condition? I don't I've never heard of it\n\n01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:21.160\nIt's a connective tissue disorder. It's hereditary. So like my collagen instead of it being like rubber bands\n\n01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.280\nIt's kind of like loose noodles\n\n01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:30.040\nSo like all my tendons and like my like everywhere, but it's not as stretchy\n\n01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:37.680\nNo, it's over over stretch. Well, it's just like it's wobbly. It's like wibbly wobbly. It's just gone\n\n01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:41.960\nLike the there's stuff in your body that keeps it like if you were to go\n\n01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:47.040\nIt's over there and you pointed too hard your arm couldn't like fly out of your socket and\n\n01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:51.840\nlike if I lift like a carton of milk my wrist will dislocate and\n\n01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:59.360\nAnd and you find out about this at what age? I was like 27, but I got like\n\n01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.200\nfive or six different wrong\n\n01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:03.960\ndiagnosis\n\n01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:10.680\nI've been trying for seven years to get a diagnosis for it. So and when did you land on this diagnosis?\n\n01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:12.840\nHow recently was two years ago two years?\n\n01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:20.480\nIt's really it's it's not that rare, but people don't get diagnosed properly\n\n01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:25.040\nSo there's a lot of people who actually because what's happening at first when people go to the doctor?\n\n01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:30.400\nWhat are that would not to inspire people as a new podcast to go? Oh my god? I have this which is what I will do\n\n01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:33.120\nYeah, well first it was just a\n\n01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:42.640\nJoint pain and like dislocations and then like a bunch of other stuff started happening and how quickly was that?\n\n01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:54.920\nWell, I think a lot of us are walking around with a lot of shitty stuff. We did I don't know not to beat a dead horse\n\n01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:58.960\nBut I definitely don't think that you should think that it had anything to do with\n\n01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:04.520\nAnything that you've done. I don't think it's direct karma for what I did\n\n01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:06.120\nYeah\n\n01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:09.040\nBut also at the same time you're like, okay\n\n01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:16.160\nI have a personal relationship with a with with something and you're like, yeah, you kind of balance to get out in your head\n\n01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.400\nWhat's your name? Can we ask?\n\n01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:26.520\nYeah, okay, that's fine. Yeah, they're gonna be like it's someone else who has this disease\n\n01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.800\nUsed to go to bars. I think that might be Steve\n\n01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:38.480\nI've already since there's not really anybody else that my friends would know that have this but yeah, my name's\n\n01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:46.120\nOh, okay. Well, thank you Krista for sharing. We really appreciate that. That's what I wanted. I wanted you you help me\n\n01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.440\nYou make my podcast amazing\n\n01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:51.240\nThat's all I care about\n\n01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.200\nIt's all I care about\n\n01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:58.120\nI suck your humanity out of your bodies. That's all I care about\n\n01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:03.480\nIt's a good podcast now. I think this is how you get less than a five-star rating\n\n01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:09.920\nThank you, Krista, that was really touching. I was yeah, I hope the sound I hope the sound mixing works\n\n01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:13.000\nDustin are you gonna make sure that that yeah, does that sound good?\n\n01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:17.440\nHow would you know you had headphones on during the whole thing?\n\n01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:21.000\nI really like that. I don't know. I like that\n\n01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.640\nYeah, I like that a lot my joke\n\n01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:28.400\nNo, not your joke. I don't like anything about you\n\n01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:37.760\nIs it weird for you guys to see yourself on screen and talk about the period where you guys weren't talking?\n\n01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:41.040\nNo, not for me because I feel vindicated\n\n01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:49.320\nLike the story is about like some thing published Sarah Silverman show like with what six episodes I\n\n01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:51.320\nI\n\n01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:54.800\nregret asking\n\n01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:04.960\nLike obviously, you know, come on you measure a man by how many documentaries are made after him\n\n01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.720\nSo Hitler is the greatest man of all time. Yeah\n\n01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.600\nAnd the Beatles\n\n01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:17.880\nNo, I I mean I like I when Schrab and I\n\n01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:21.480\nI like when Sarah fired me I\n\n01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:24.400\nWas probably like at that point\n\n01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:29.040\nNot probably it was the word. It was like my worst nightmare scenario\n\n01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:34.360\nI remember being so angry and I knew I had nowhere to put the anger. I had no\n\n01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:39.920\nIt didn't I would tell people like the people that I dated, you know\n\n01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:45.040\nWho in whom I would confide it would be like I'm telling you this thing that is making me very upset\n\n01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:49.560\nAnd I know that I don't have any right. I can't tell anyone about this\n\n01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:55.560\nI can't tell anyone how angry I'm about this because I will sound like the most petty piece of shit in the world\n\n01:35:55.560 --> 01:36:01.880\nAnd I can't I can't admit to myself that that I I wish Rob Schrab\n\n01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.920\nless luck\n\n01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:11.560\nThan he deserves I can't tell him I can't I can't express the fact that I wish\n\n01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:15.920\nThat the Sarah Silverman program would fail without me, you know\n\n01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.480\nI have these petty golem-like thoughts\n\n01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:26.160\nAbout my precious and I can't express them like and then that makes it worse and worse and it festers and all that stuff\n\n01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:31.560\nAnd I so it was a year of because I couldn't express those things because I knew they were unhealthy\n\n01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:37.920\nLike Rob and I didn't talk to each other for like a year at all and then this guy Mike Ash died\n\n01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:39.960\ncomedies\n\n01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:44.680\ncomedy channel 101 Mike Ash, he was an old timer who\n\n01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.560\nDid a bunch of channel 101 stuff and he\n\n01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:55.120\nHe he died and it was at his memorial service Rob and I started to talk again. It was\n\n01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.680\nIt was I don't know whatever\n\n01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:03.760\nI'm I'm I'm over it when I watch that stuff. I'm like, oh, that's cute\n\n01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:06.680\nThat's obviously I'm insane\n\n01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.600\nso\n\n01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:12.440\nRJ there was this movie that was playing earlier\n\n01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.240\nYeah, it was about these guys and it was a great it was a lot of fun\n\n01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:24.000\nCan you talk to your friends and ask them way 4.8? I mean\n\n01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000\nI was gonna say something\n\n01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:32.040\nNo, okay. No, not you me. Yeah, you were gonna say something\n\n01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:35.040\nYes\n\n01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:37.160\nGreat\n\n01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.160\nWhat\n\n01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:43.360\nWell, I agree with Dan. Yeah, you know\n\n01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:47.960\nEverything's okay now. I would yeah, I mean, yeah\n\n01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:51.400\nGreat. I mean, it's I mean like I\n\n01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:53.520\nWasn't\n\n01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:59.320\nProud I the one thing that I wish I would have said at the time while we were doing the interview is that I\n\n01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:05.160\nStayed I knew it was the right thing to do for me, but I was not\n\n01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:12.020\nProud of that decision at all like it was a decision that I really wish I didn't have to do\n\n01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:18.880\nYeah, I don't think anybody says I don't think he made the wrong decision because it's very hard to get\n\n01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:25.160\nNo, I would tell me that's the other thing I would tell people is like the crazy thing is if Rob hadn't stayed\n\n01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:30.720\nIt would be more of a mind fuck right because as I told Rob when Sarah fired me\n\n01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:37.680\nI was like because Rob had already been riding my trail of tears. Is that a appropriate metaphor? What is that?\n\n01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:46.040\nRob had already been like on that journey with me a couple times and I was like look I get it like obviously\n\n01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:50.240\nThis is pathological for me. I don't expect you to to keep doing this\n\n01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:57.480\nIt what if Rob had quit out of loyalty? What if a silverman fired me from a basic cable comedy show and Rob had gone?\n\n01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:00.480\nWell, you know\n\n01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:10.880\nFriendship is friendship. Let's just do it. Then I would be fine. I I almost did I was really tempted to you know, but I I\n\n01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.360\nNever I\n\n01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:19.560\nWanted to see if I could do it alone. I mean like when when you're a writing\n\n01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:22.920\nOr any kind of partnership you're always like\n\n01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:27.520\nWell, who's pulling the weight, you know, who's really the smart guy?\n\n01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:33.320\nWho's really the the guy that's just hanging along and I wanted to see if I could even exist alone\n\n01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:37.120\nI for the longest time didn't think I could do anything by myself\n\n01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:41.560\neven the comic book so I\n\n01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:47.960\nSaid this is really a difficult decision, but I really think I need to to do this\n\n01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:52.760\nYeah, and yeah, I mean if you get fired in the midst of that, it's like holy shit\n\n01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:54.960\nYeah, like now I really have to ask that question\n\n01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:02.080\nAnd answer it and it worked out fine. It was great for now. We're now we're both 53 and we don't yeah shit about anything\n\n01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.160\nand\n\n01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:06.160\nAll right, well\n\n01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:08.360\nWe we we we we should\n\n01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:16.200\nWe should let you probably take off. I mean you've got a lot that you have your losing money being up here\n\n01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:23.600\nYeah, RJ. Oh, oh RJ. No RJ will be compensated. Yes, but we should we should put a ribbon on the show and\n\n01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:27.400\nFor these people these people are losing money. They have\n\n01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:31.260\nThey have shows to develop tomorrow\n\n01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.560\nLike Wayne Wayne is like will he notice if I leave?\n\n01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:36.760\nthe the\n\n01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:41.080\nLet's but usually we end the show. We're not gonna play Dungeons and Dragons\n\n01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:48.440\nI mean, we I don't know how to do it because we're sitting in director's chairs. We don't have the equipment. I was being kidding. I\n\n01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:53.120\nWas being kidding\n\n01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:57.120\nBut the show has an addiction to Dungeons and Dragons as a show closer\n\n01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:01.160\nSo I don't know how to close the show really usually at the show RJ\n\n01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.520\nWe played Dungeons and Dragons at the end gets it\n\n01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:10.440\nDo you know if you don't like any chance to have a beatbox to you RJ because I can rap. Oh\n\n01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:14.280\nYou don't know he does no he does I could see it, you know\n\n01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:17.320\nIt seemed like if I do I suck at it\n\n01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:21.280\nOh, so I thought let's hear it. Let's hear your worst beatbox and I'll do mine\n\n01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:34.280\nIt's just so you don't feel bad. Like what if I what am I what have I started so you could drift it on the back?\n\n01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:36.280\nI\n\n01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.800\nKnow you've got you stopped. Oh\n\n01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:57.240\nYeah, no, that was amazing. Everyone was like holy shit. Holy shit. I told you to do it\n\n01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.360\nAll right, now we fuck that up\n\n01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:05.860\nThat was great beatboxing because then if I could have just rhymed milk with silk, we could have been done\n\n01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:11.420\nSuspensive, why don't you beatbox and then you run milk with silk? Oh, I can't beatbox. I was lying\n\n01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:18.080\nRob, can you beatbox? No, no, all right.

You don't have to do it. You can\n\n01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:40.980\nAll right, yeah, use the use the Q&A mic. Let's let's let's audition you. Let's see how this goes\n\n01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:45.760\nYeah, so give me a give me a pretty slow tempo.
