WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.520
From Fantastic Uptown Burbank, Harmontown is now in session.

00:13.520 --> 00:22.120
Let's put your groovy chicken hands together for the Game Master extraordinaire, Mr. Spencer

00:22.120 --> 00:34.360
Crittenden. Hell yeah! Spencer is going to do a little freestyle for us to start the show off.

00:34.360 --> 00:49.360
Hey guys, it's me, Spencer MC. Gonna rap really slow. If I do that, I might keep the flow.

00:49.360 --> 01:00.760
That's all I got. I think I'm really bad at rapping. Put your hands together out there in

01:00.760 --> 01:09.280
podcast land for the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon. Oh yeah. Thank you. The cotton has been

01:09.280 --> 01:16.840
dropped. Did you hear that freestyle? Yeah, I couldn't hear all of it. I felt like it was good.

01:16.840 --> 01:20.320
I felt like it was good enough to get us going. There might have to be a slow rap battle right now.

01:20.320 --> 01:29.200
Yeah, I think we're got it. Spencer worked us up. Cut that shit. Oh, you scared. You runnin' scared.

01:29.200 --> 01:38.640
Yeah, the refusal of a call, man. You runnin' from my slow fire. I got no problem admitting that.

01:38.640 --> 01:43.920
We've heard my rapping the last six months. I mean, not that it was better before that,

01:43.920 --> 01:51.520
but now it's gotten bad and sterile. I like it. It used to be interesting that I was a surgeon

01:51.520 --> 01:56.840
that worked with a rusty spoon, and then I washed and cleaned the spoon and replaced it with one

01:56.840 --> 02:03.760
from Target. Creatively speaking, it's still good. Don't mean to offend any Target employees out

02:03.760 --> 02:11.240
there. Fight for 15. Minimum wage, socialism. Let's all share money until we die. Just not mine.

02:11.240 --> 02:21.160
Hope you're in the mood for a bad show tonight. What are you going to do? Take your business

02:21.160 --> 02:29.080
elsewhere? No, I'm going to go give $5 a month. How could it be bad? We got so many good things.

02:29.080 --> 02:36.640
No, we got great things, but I just, I should, I said bad to be facetious. And self kind of

02:36.640 --> 02:42.200
deprecating. I was, I was going to, what I really meant in my head was kind of a sleepy show, a low

02:42.200 --> 02:46.960
energy show. Okay. I'm not real. I'm not feeling, I'm not excited. Remember when I was excited

02:46.960 --> 02:52.240
about Killer B's and going into the lake? Oh, would that we could go back to then? By the way,

02:52.240 --> 02:57.720
some, by the way, some guy tweeted me, you know, multiple tweet story about how a friend of his,

02:57.720 --> 03:05.160
he's named after his best friend's dad who died in a bee attack. They found him drowned with bees

03:05.160 --> 03:11.760
in his throat. He didn't say this directly, but I'm going to go ahead and assume that he was

03:11.760 --> 03:18.680
trying to in your face us like a bee. Like, like, he's trying to save your life. No, he was trying

03:18.680 --> 03:24.000
to say, I got you. I'm the guy you're looking for. I'm the guy at the story about a bee attack

03:24.000 --> 03:30.200
where someone died because they jumped in water. Doesn't work. And like I told the guy on Twitter,

03:30.200 --> 03:35.640
look, you brought your friend's dad's ghost into the courtroom. So I'm not being insensitive to

03:35.640 --> 03:41.840
his life. I want your friend and his dad to be respected. But since, since he's exhibit A,

03:41.840 --> 03:48.040
I have to be clinical about and say, this doesn't prove anything. I know that if Killer B's are

03:48.040 --> 03:56.440
chasing you and you jump into water, they may be able to wait for you, monitor your carbon dioxide

03:56.440 --> 04:01.520
bubbles. And when you stick your head above water, fly into your nose and mouth, sting you,

04:01.520 --> 04:08.960
and, and effectively kill you. Like Jason Voorhees in the deleted scene of the Derek Mears version,

04:08.960 --> 04:15.000
where Jason Voorhees just stands outside Crystal Lake, so that the woman who's trying to get away

04:15.000 --> 04:20.520
from him by swimming, just she just slowly drowns. He's walking around. Yeah, she just keeps swimming

04:20.520 --> 04:26.520
each side of Crystal Lake. And then Jason just walks around the lake and watches her drown. He's

04:26.520 --> 04:33.840
like a one man beehive. Did they edit that out of the movie? I remember seeing that where he,

04:33.840 --> 04:39.000
where he, I remember Derek, Derek describing that to me. And I was like, this confirms that this

04:39.000 --> 04:45.960
Friday the 13th reboot will be not the final chapter. Because it sounds awesome. Someone,

04:45.960 --> 04:52.320
someone thought of that. I like that. I like, I like it when brutality isn't just a torture porn

04:52.320 --> 04:56.840
when it's more like, I guess it kind of is torture porn. Let's think of a new way to kill a lady.

04:56.840 --> 05:02.360
All right. Well, I guess that franchise deserved to die. Okay. This was my, my friend could have

05:02.360 --> 05:07.760
gotten more work. Did you watch any of those Winter Olympics, Dan? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What? Which

05:07.760 --> 05:17.440
ones? I like the figure skating. Yeah. Why? The spinning, the triumph of the human will. Yeah.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.240
Dan's going to get a sports corner in that thing.

05:27.240 --> 05:40.680
Hey, Olympics. Yeah, I figure skating. Look, I'm not going to, I know it's 2018 and Dan Harmon

05:40.680 --> 05:46.640
hasn't had a year where anyone's going to him for opinions about what's sexually titillating.

05:46.640 --> 05:52.120
I'm not a popular source of that information. It's no longer charming for me to talk about the

05:52.120 --> 05:58.720
things that make me excited. You don't have to like what you like without crossing a line.

05:58.720 --> 06:03.120
No, it's just not charismatic. I know I'm allowed to do all kinds of stuff. Just saying,

06:03.120 --> 06:09.440
I know, I know, I know that's not really what's for sale with me. But I, but I, but you brought

06:09.440 --> 06:18.040
it up. Look, I figure skate, female figure skating outfits are how I wish everyone dressed in

06:18.040 --> 06:26.800
normal life. Whoa, even you? Sure, I'll do anything. Yeah, it's just, it's very 80s. It's

06:26.800 --> 06:32.360
very like the gauzy little skirts and the just the, and obviously, you know, but it's interesting

06:32.360 --> 06:39.080
because I look at the outfits and the outfits are titillating, but it truly is. It clearly is

06:39.080 --> 06:45.520
also the motion, the grace, you know, the things that are difficult that somehow are also that's,

06:45.520 --> 06:51.880
it makes the person beautiful. So you keep going back and forth. Like, I will, since you guys are

06:51.880 --> 06:55.520
subscribers and no one else is going to hear this, I will tell you, I did try to masturbate to

06:55.520 --> 07:01.560
figure skating this year, just to see if I could. You tried unsuccessfully or? Well, I mean, I

07:01.560 --> 07:07.480
didn't, I didn't like stay on it. I went, I ended up going to Pornhub premium and typing figure

07:07.480 --> 07:13.000
skating. Right. Just because I was like, well, wait a minute, what if I was trying to masturbate

07:13.000 --> 07:18.960
to a women's biathlon where they ski and shoot, but the MVC keeps going to commercial. Oh, yeah.

07:18.960 --> 07:26.320
As long as we're objectifying Olympians, like, I, I, the, the, the, it's interesting, the, the

07:26.320 --> 07:31.960
curling, everybody's crazy about the Korean curlers and the, I mean, the guys. The US men's

07:31.960 --> 07:38.000
team. They're fetishizing. But there's also like the Swedish curlers. I mean, look, I'm now, now

07:38.000 --> 07:43.320
I'm in territory where maybe Cody could get upset. Like, I think she can't get upset. Me talking

07:43.320 --> 07:47.840
about outfits on figure skaters. So I don't want to, I don't want to go into the Swedish curling

07:47.840 --> 07:54.560
team. We're talking about the men's or women's. Let's say the men. Okay. Get me out of this dog

07:54.560 --> 07:59.480
house. All right. Let's move on. Now, while we're talking about curling outfits, I was very excited.

07:59.480 --> 08:06.120
I was in Canada when the gold medal bout was happening between the US and was it the Swiss? I

08:06.120 --> 08:12.440
believe. I think it's, I think it was the Swiss. It was the Swiss. And I was so happy that the men

08:12.440 --> 08:15.720
won because they'd never won. And Canada has never lost. There was the first Olympics where

08:15.720 --> 08:23.840
Canada didn't get a medal in curling or hockey for the men. And I was very excited. And then I was

08:23.840 --> 08:30.840
talking to church and two of the guys had red ball caps on. One guys was the bill was rounded

08:30.840 --> 08:36.200
like, like a ball player. The other guys was kind of flat, like kind of a MAGA, like Trumpy hats.

08:36.920 --> 08:44.160
And I kind of put a little bit of like, I spent, I think the hours between one and two a.m. in

08:44.160 --> 08:49.560
Vancouver, Googling and searching through Twitter to see if the men's curling team were

08:49.560 --> 08:57.840
Trumpies. I don't want to ask the curling questions that everybody asks. Why is it a sport? Like,

08:57.840 --> 09:02.560
why, since it is a sport, why hasn't anyone gotten so good at putting the puck where it belongs

09:02.560 --> 09:06.920
that you actually need sweepy people to guide it to its spot? Like, why wouldn't it be the best

09:06.920 --> 09:11.960
strategy of all? You put a little spin on it. And the stone starts to curl. But the sweeping

09:11.960 --> 09:16.560
you just can speed it up and actually give it a little kind of furrow to go into. You can give

09:16.560 --> 09:22.320
it like left or right angle. You could say all of these things about a dart in the air, like

09:22.320 --> 09:26.160
there's it's not part of darts that a helicopter comes down and like lassoes the dart or someone

09:26.160 --> 09:29.960
blows on it. It's not part of shuffleboard that someone like oils the path in front of the

09:29.960 --> 09:34.720
shuffleboard puck. Why is why is curling not just like a person that doesn't know what a freeze or

09:34.720 --> 09:40.680
a draw or a draw weight. Like I said, I'm not gonna I'd be a total hypocrite to suggest that

09:40.680 --> 09:45.400
something's more Olympic than something else. I don't care. If the kids are having a good time,

09:45.400 --> 09:53.960
I'm happy for them curling. It's really about the yardage. But I am I am kind of surprised. It's

09:53.960 --> 09:59.400
about the figure skating to all about the yard. Do you think that figure skating will ever be and

09:59.400 --> 10:05.560
I almost like I'm such a pervert that about my figure skating that I I almost feel like I'm

10:05.560 --> 10:11.840
like I'm causing trouble for myself by bringing it up. But you can't help but sit there in these

10:11.840 --> 10:16.520
changing times and watch figure skating ago. It just seems like a bit of a throwback at this point.

10:16.520 --> 10:25.040
A throwback for which I am eternally grateful. But but I like isn't it kind of actually remarkable

10:25.040 --> 10:30.040
that we that that no one's come in and gone put some pants on these women for God's sakes. We

10:30.040 --> 10:35.520
see the guys can skate in pants. What do we why we keep dressing them like playboy bunnies. Well,

10:35.520 --> 10:41.080
I don't think any any sport that's like inspired a hit is up for revision. Yeah, it's worth a lot

10:41.080 --> 10:45.360
of money. And also like you don't but it's probably also it's it'll be slow to change

10:45.360 --> 10:50.680
because of the amount of discipline. Like no one's changed how ballet dancers carry themselves

10:50.680 --> 10:56.880
like they're it's such an it's such a difficult honor to become a ballet dancer in you know of

10:56.880 --> 11:02.360
right that that no one along the way is like going to allow themselves to be distracted by

11:02.360 --> 11:05.800
questions about whether they should be doing this thing that they've been doing since they've been

11:05.800 --> 11:10.400
three years old. It is crazy. I mean I've heard that there's like something called the quad jump

11:10.400 --> 11:16.560
that's changing up the figure skating game. Yeah, the forget her name US figure skater land

11:16.560 --> 11:20.440
of the first quad in women's like she's the only woman's figure skater that's land of the quad.

11:20.440 --> 11:24.360
Something like that. I will say this is the year that I finally I think it's part of it's like

11:24.360 --> 11:29.600
getting middle age like maybe my hormones have tapered enough that I really am just noticing

11:29.600 --> 11:35.200
how beautiful how graceful you know I'm like appreciative of the actual discipline and like

11:35.200 --> 11:40.320
probably also just like well these Olympics only happen in whatever decade what is it four years

11:40.320 --> 11:45.920
something like that. Well two years per summer winner but four years per event you see it. Four

11:45.920 --> 11:53.920
year Olympia. Okay so well four years ago I was I was a real douche. Yeah but and I was probably

11:53.920 --> 11:58.720
still just like that's hot. You hadn't even thought about how you still are but now I'm kind

11:58.720 --> 12:05.120
well I still am but now I'm like that's hot plus because of grace. Yeah right but that is the sport

12:05.120 --> 12:09.760
like that gracefulness like I mean you know like you said it's like ballet but like that is you

12:09.760 --> 12:14.080
know that's that's I think what the judges are looking for and stuff so that is yeah that's what

12:14.080 --> 12:20.240
they are mastering definitely. Yeah do you think we need to see their their legs in sheer

12:23.600 --> 12:28.080
I think they want to right that's probably in order to be able to see that they're like pulling

12:28.080 --> 12:33.600
off like twirls they want to do it like yeah I think the angles the lines I think that's that's

12:33.600 --> 12:37.920
all part of it I think but also I think there's a heritage to that where it's all about this kind of

12:37.920 --> 12:42.160
there's a heritage there's a lot of things that were good under the microscope this year

12:42.160 --> 12:49.360
savory uh to name a few I hate the Olympics yeah the five thousand yard witch hunt

12:52.240 --> 12:59.760
Salem Olympics but I well is that what just one more thing about it dunking I think thank you to

12:59.760 --> 13:03.840
all the figure skaters out there that are working diligently and spend their lives

13:03.840 --> 13:10.560
disciplining but especially just the ones that don't opt for the for the flesh colored over the

13:10.560 --> 13:17.520
skate uh tight pant thing that turns your leg into an ice skate I like the speed skaters because

13:17.520 --> 13:20.880
they get out there with giant ass knives in their feet and they're right they're riding right close

13:20.880 --> 13:25.600
to each other when they wipe out it's just knives flying around and they just go sailing into a

13:25.600 --> 13:30.240
like into a padded wall and it's like it's it's pretty exciting I'm shocked that these people

13:30.240 --> 13:35.840
can get the knives in their feet all of them god bless them I mean that's that's I've been on ice

13:35.840 --> 13:41.040
skates like it's fucking I can't even roller skate without like breaking my ass roller skating is

13:41.040 --> 13:45.680
10 times easier than ice skating that's how crazy ice skating is it's like you just get out there

13:45.680 --> 13:52.480
and you just I I still just like I'll just stand on my ankles like I just I don't just wait until

13:52.480 --> 13:58.720
we figure out it's not a good idea let me do this all right well that's enough of that

14:00.480 --> 14:10.160
okay uh let's uh Dan yeah let's hit a rap beat you you visibly lost weight since I've last seen

14:10.160 --> 14:18.160

talk about you like a hunk of money like like oh like that's okay right like fantastic I know you're

16:36.480 --> 16:43.920
a human being I just I'm proud to to know a guy from the fucking 90s black and white comic book

16:43.920 --> 16:51.040
world that that turned it into like something I mean Kevin Eastman yeah fuck Kevin Eastman

16:51.840 --> 16:56.480
what's he done with his life you don't even hear about the turtles anymore it's not like

16:56.480 --> 17:01.680
they're like on television every week or something it's ridiculous it's crazy but uh but no no I mean

17:01.680 --> 17:06.480
that's uh you know it's a little weird it's not something I think about 24 7 so when people say

17:06.480 --> 17:11.920
it I'm kind of like oh yeah but if you're not the only one it happens a lot to tell just tell us

17:11.920 --> 17:18.160
something like in the last well I don't know something that sticks out in your head as a moment

17:18.160 --> 17:24.560
when you're like Jesus Christ that's really rich about yourself that you were like someone came

17:24.560 --> 17:30.000
up to you uh and said can I have a car and you were like yeah and then as they drove away you're

17:30.000 --> 17:38.960
like whoa that's not me I can't believe I gave that guy a car I've never given anyone a car well I mean

17:39.840 --> 17:43.840
given family members cars I'm trying to think of an example like so I so I can pay the way for you

17:46.320 --> 17:51.040
don't worry about that yeah I did this Robert have you ever given anybody a free iPad and not

17:51.040 --> 17:58.800
lorded it over them yeah you have me too that's actually very interesting to hear yeah I wouldn't

17:58.800 --> 18:02.640
I wouldn't like that's a like a that's a little shitty thing to do is I like uh yeah that's something

18:02.640 --> 18:08.080
you did Dan no Dan didn't actually give anyone an iPad he just let him borrow it yeah but he did

18:08.080 --> 18:14.480
he did make him feel bad about it yeah I heard this on the previous episode I uh I buy every Apple

18:14.480 --> 18:21.680
TV movie no I don't rent it I just buy it because I want to watch them on my other my other devices

18:21.680 --> 18:28.320
but that's not normal that's a rich that's a rich guy thing sure yeah every Apple TV movie or just

18:28.320 --> 18:32.720
the ones you like there's a couple that I'll just rent if it's like a found footage Canadian horror

18:32.720 --> 18:40.000
movie probably like okay I'll rent this so maybe it's psychotic I'll go ahead and admit that but

18:40.000 --> 18:49.120
I will often you know buy movies on iTunes but at the same time if I catch my wife buying something

18:49.120 --> 18:55.760
on iTunes like a real housewives of wherever and I know it's available on another app that

18:55.760 --> 19:01.680
we subscribe to for free I'll be like hey come on why are you doing that we wasting that three

19:01.680 --> 19:06.720
dollars for yeah I won't like yell at her anything but I will annoy her to a point where yeah she

19:06.720 --> 19:11.600
gets mad at me you're not being miserly that's uh that's a that's a redditor thing that's your

19:11.600 --> 19:16.720
ass be brain like it's a logic addiction you're like you can't check hulu you can't check hulu

19:16.720 --> 19:22.560
before you buy this thing on don't fall for the apple trap yeah our demographic has the highest

19:22.560 --> 19:29.200
ratio of uh wait I don't know how to phrase it it's the the highest ratio of disposable income to

19:29.200 --> 19:36.800
total unacceptance of like throwing money away like it's like like I've never seen people that are

19:36.800 --> 19:42.400
probably pretty rich uh talk so meticulously about what they're getting for three dollars here

19:42.400 --> 19:47.120
two dollars there like it's not it's not even cheapness it is it's like because they'll give

19:47.120 --> 19:51.280
fifty dollars to the Red Cross if they see a hurricane like they're good people that they're

19:51.280 --> 19:57.440
not miserly but if they're addicted to uh logic they don't want to be a sucker exactly yeah and I

19:57.440 --> 20:03.280
did the math one time I was you know I was like well if she bought one or two a week for an entire

20:03.280 --> 20:08.880
year we're looking at like a hundred dollars all right quit making your wife mad at you but yeah

20:08.880 --> 20:14.000
I still I still do it sometimes anytime I do the math I'm like man none of this matters anytime I do

20:14.000 --> 20:18.560
the math it's like this doesn't add up to I shouldn't have even done the math let me ask

20:18.560 --> 20:25.200
some walking dead questions that I've been afraid to ask oh like what happens after they leave the

20:25.200 --> 20:33.440
prison I've been afraid to ask that because it makes me a bad friend almost every question

20:34.160 --> 20:37.840
that you could ask like that they find another well is they some of them die

20:41.040 --> 20:44.880
I see there's a guy with a bat that has barbed wire on the bat now that he looks like he's

20:44.880 --> 20:48.160
gonna be a problem you don't watch the show I haven't watched it since they left the prison it's

20:48.160 --> 20:52.160
not because I know that's fine that in fact was the high point you can ask you know we don't need

20:52.160 --> 20:58.240
you I don't I know you don't and I but ask ask Gimple Scott Gimple I I went to dinner with him

20:58.240 --> 21:03.440
and I was like holy it was right after the prison you know what happened when they left the prison

21:03.440 --> 21:07.760
that's when Scott Gimple took over a showrunner so your buddy you haven't watched any of his

21:07.760 --> 21:12.400
episodes at all yeah I was it yeah I guess maybe he accepted the praise and he shouldn't have but

21:12.400 --> 21:18.880
yeah I was like man you guys are nailing it yeah and I and then I and then you just I don't know

21:18.880 --> 21:23.920
maybe I look I haven't watched it let me do a run through so they leave the prison and then

21:23.920 --> 21:30.640
they go to this place called Terminus and then I'm not gonna recap Robert no offense I don't

21:30.640 --> 21:35.280
watch a lot of TV shows I've never seen one second of walking dead even how many seasons has this

21:35.280 --> 21:40.960
been on for we we're just starting the back half of season eight Jesus Christ but also that's it's

21:40.960 --> 21:45.360
almost more walking dead than anyone can add that's a strong eight because there's also like three

21:45.360 --> 21:50.640
shows coming off of it there's a there's a cooking dead walking there's a there's a there's a cooking

21:50.640 --> 22:01.120
dead chopped junior for just kids who make food who are zombies um Chris Hardwick like like sits

22:01.120 --> 22:06.480
in a bathtub and talks about walking dead in two different shows and then there's an actual other

22:06.480 --> 22:12.080
walking dead show there's a scripting dead where they just show pages from the script and they just

22:12.080 --> 22:19.360
slowly turn that could be huge how how how has how is fear of the walking dead uh there's no of

22:19.360 --> 22:25.440
right oh fear fear okay that would be yeah and even I know that fear of the walking dead that

22:25.440 --> 22:29.680
that does start automatically like a worse show because it's like it could just be people in a

22:29.680 --> 22:38.160
room I ain't going outside I'm not going outside like I hear there's zombies out there there might be I have fear of the walking dead I'm staying indoors

22:39.200 --> 22:46.400
how how has that been uh critically creatively financially run through the metrics check check and

22:46.400 --> 22:50.800
check I don't know it's all been fine it's still on everybody's happy with it yeah yeah we just started

22:50.800 --> 22:55.440
our well we're working on a fourth season it'll start right after season eight we got uh Andrew

22:55.440 --> 23:00.800
Chambliss and uh Ian Goldberg taking over his showrunners this season uh we got this character

23:00.800 --> 23:05.360
Morgan from walking dead that's going to be jumping over a few of the walking dead so there's some crazy

23:05.360 --> 23:10.720
stuff jump over yeah yeah it's going to be it's going to be a cool new season oh I hope Morgan

23:10.720 --> 23:15.840
doesn't judge them for being such scary cats I think he will he's kind of a jerk that Morgan he's

23:15.840 --> 23:19.680
going to be like guys come outside it's fine I've been up to my ears in these things and you're you

23:19.680 --> 23:25.360
have a show about being scared of them what is this it's like it's like when uh it's like when

23:25.360 --> 23:31.360
Jerry Orbach went over to uh uh the trial by jury law and order it's like a kind of retirement it's

23:31.360 --> 23:35.840
a golden parachute for this Morgan character yeah yeah pretty much he's gonna go chill out and be

23:35.840 --> 23:39.680
scared of the walking dead yeah we gotta we gotta establish that we're moving him from walking dead

23:39.680 --> 23:43.120
show to walking dead show so that when we put up a new show it's like okay and now Morgan's going

23:43.120 --> 23:48.320
to this one too how many walking deads are there like I mean how many zombies like how many of

23:48.320 --> 23:55.520
the walking dead like population wise I don't I don't keep those numbers I mean just like ball

23:55.520 --> 24:01.200
park it for me I don't know like a billion billion who knows so like he's gonna get in a lot of

24:01.200 --> 24:06.160
trouble just for riffing that number it's gonna be like a 90 I'm gonna get somebody's like wait a

24:06.160 --> 24:10.560
minute hold on a billion it can't be a billion yeah clearly not shown this much it's not gonna no

24:10.560 --> 24:15.280
region wouldn't have that's gonna be worse any new season that comes out they're gonna be like

24:15.280 --> 24:21.680
based on the billion zombies that we know are on this planet this can't possibly be the amount of

24:21.680 --> 24:27.200
zombies that are in this Walmart or like whatever they're gonna be billion zombie benchmark of 2018

24:27.200 --> 24:31.760
on Harmontown well someone did the math I can't remember exactly how it broke down but

24:32.720 --> 24:38.080
it was like if 10 percent of the population remained human and they each killed like five

24:38.080 --> 24:44.160
zombies a week and every other living person was turned into a zombie they would kill all the

24:44.160 --> 24:49.920
zombies in like 11 months it's like some kind of some kind of crazy are the walking dead fans

24:51.360 --> 24:54.800
this is such a dumb question but maybe it'll start a conversation

24:56.000 --> 25:02.080
let's hope because it seems like it's got what are walking dead fans compared to other fandoms

25:02.080 --> 25:10.000
you've seen are they are they more or less obsessed with stuff like that or are they more like chill

25:10.000 --> 25:15.360
like it's not about the science or are they just this different shades I mean there are

25:16.080 --> 25:20.400
you know I get I get those essays right you know you clearly meant this was going to happen

25:20.400 --> 25:25.360
that's why it was a dumb question this and yeah but I mean there's you know there's there's there's

25:25.360 --> 25:30.400
chill fans and there's really crazy fans which I think are awesome I mean anytime I get a

25:31.120 --> 25:37.600
goddamn like 30 page book report on like a two minute scene I'm like man it's the best thing

25:37.600 --> 25:42.080
I've ever seen I'll read them I'll read the whole thing I'm like this is insane I won't read them

25:42.080 --> 25:49.360
but I'm like cha-ching sounds like I still got it I'm still immersing them I still it's like

25:49.920 --> 25:55.120
it's like if you ran a casino when you see somebody on the sidewalk crying you're like

25:55.120 --> 26:03.440
fuck I still got it so Dan you didn't read my 20 page essay on community uh no no I mean I thought

26:03.440 --> 26:10.240
I was offended by the title I thought it was uh you know we all we all missed Donald you don't

26:10.240 --> 26:19.200
have to uh if I can dig into the show when it's at its weak point um the uh but uh are you okay

26:19.200 --> 26:23.520
shifting gears ever so slightly though you got you just also finished you're just telling me

26:23.520 --> 26:31.840
right before we came on 15 years of Invincible yes your other comic book yeah yeah the last

26:31.840 --> 26:38.240
issue came out uh last week I think did it did did he become invincible yeah he died no no

26:39.120 --> 26:43.440
they lived happily ever after it was pretty lame but uh because if you only lived for 15 years

26:43.440 --> 26:47.680
that's not even Invincible that's like I can do that I did it three times already

26:50.080 --> 26:54.480
fair point fair point no he did not die at the end of the book spoiler alert is it easier

26:54.480 --> 27:00.800
hard to end uh end a 15 year long comic book series uh it was pretty I don't know it was

27:00.800 --> 27:05.840
difficult in that uh I mean when I was writing the last issue I kept coming up with more ideas

27:05.840 --> 27:11.280
for the next issue oh yeah stop brain this is not what we're doing right what are you doing uh

27:11.280 --> 27:15.280
and then it just made me sad because you know I've been living with these characters for you said

27:15.280 --> 27:20.640
you were writing a script every month they get you for 15 years including the nine years that you

27:20.640 --> 27:26.000
didn't have to do it anymore or anything you could have run in the street naked and said I'm

27:26.000 --> 27:31.360
Robert Kirkman arrest me and no one would be allowed to me because of the money yeah yeah uh

27:31.360 --> 27:35.280
yeah I don't know I try to ignore that kind of stuff also you know if you sit down and do the math

27:35.280 --> 27:42.400
it's like all right I'm gonna be broke by like 62 I'm hoping to live longer than 62 come on you have

27:42.400 --> 27:49.760
you have drew carry money by now as in like you have so much money true or false that I could host

27:49.760 --> 27:54.560
prices right that if you put in all his money that he's giving away is that what you're saying

27:54.560 --> 27:57.600
well I think Drew's being smart and going like he's gonna he didn't want to he didn't want to be

27:57.600 --> 28:00.960
caught here I don't think he was like running I'm so rich sometimes I watch the prices right and

28:00.960 --> 28:06.080
I'm like really that's all you guys are excited over that yeah exactly that's one bigger race

28:06.080 --> 28:15.360
eroni um who cares what it costs sticking up your ass stupid housewife um the 225 the the uh

28:16.400 --> 28:20.960
why did he say that it's the price of rice eroni oh oh I thought you said it's 825 I was like

28:20.960 --> 28:25.920
jeez when did you become a fucking runtime Nazi wow I thought you were like I thought you were like

28:25.920 --> 28:30.400
come on keep the show I was like you know we don't do anything I was making my bid on rice eroni

28:30.400 --> 28:34.640
okay well I'm projecting yeah ashamed of the show I don't think it's a very good we get back to me

28:34.640 --> 28:43.280
yes um thank you thank you the but but 15 years every month like like I and we can segue into

28:43.280 --> 28:51.200
bringing up an old friend of ours uh for better or for worse like I mean I watched Schrab work that

28:51.200 --> 28:58.240
circuit like I mean that's it's pretty remarkable that you kept doing it and truly yeah you didn't

28:58.240 --> 29:03.200
have to anymore I mean it's weird I don't want to get sentimental or anything but it is the

29:03.200 --> 29:07.920
thing I love to do I mean it's the thing I wanted to do when I grew up and and I and I you know was

29:07.920 --> 29:13.920
fortunate enough to do it I don't care about television right well yeah I like that walking

29:13.920 --> 29:19.600
dead is a show I enjoy working in it it's a it's a fun thing money's great uh but you know my true

29:19.600 --> 29:25.200
passion is comic books and so to I mean being able to do a story for 15 years was all I ever wanted

29:25.200 --> 29:30.640
as a kid you know you read Peter David's incredible Hulk run or Walt Simonson's run on Thor or any

29:30.640 --> 29:33.600
of these other books that most people who who are listening to this probably have no idea what I'm

29:33.600 --> 29:39.280
talking about uh but uh uh you know it's something that uh you know I always grew up going oh my

29:39.280 --> 29:43.600
god wouldn't it be nice to be able to do that and so you know to get to a point where I could do it

29:43.600 --> 29:48.960
and to stop you know my inner child would have been angry yeah I guess I don't have that I'm like

29:48.960 --> 29:54.000
what's like hot like like no no passion I mean I like I always liked writing but it's because it

29:54.000 --> 30:00.320
made me feel safe from a planet of fucking drooling idiots that were otherwise kill me timing like

30:00.320 --> 30:05.920
like like I was like oh god they seem to enjoy when I do this like they're the bloodlust in their eyes

30:05.920 --> 30:12.000
like simmers down for a second I might make it to retirement but now I'm like how do I get out

30:12.000 --> 30:17.520
let me out anyways let's bring up Rob Schrab oh yeah

30:17.520 --> 30:26.480
when it's time for Schrab and he's coming you need Rob Schrab

30:30.560 --> 30:41.760
he's Rob Schrab he's coming in his own by lo hello thank you for letting me in Robert

30:41.760 --> 30:52.240
wasn't my choice my two comic book buddies yes my two artists

30:52.240 --> 30:57.600
up here hey you guys tonight two of the most successful comic book artists

31:00.320 --> 31:03.680
just the two most successful comic book artists

31:03.680 --> 31:15.840
would be gone off the face of the earth um if a bomb blew up in the middle of this building

31:15.840 --> 31:25.520
right now two of the most successful comic book artists ever in comic books would be no more off

31:25.520 --> 31:28.960
the face of the earth you were saying damn this bomb starting to sound more and more appealing

31:28.960 --> 31:37.520
oh yeah you have no idea uh I learned how to draw women

31:39.360 --> 31:48.480
whoa here we go their chins are thinner yeah uh that's fair no I've been I've been uh I've

31:48.480 --> 31:53.360
been doing like Dan Reddit's gonna fucking eat that up tomorrow man I've been I've been doing well

31:53.360 --> 31:56.640
your chin doesn't have to be thin if you you don't have you also don't have to be a woman

31:56.640 --> 32:05.120
look I'm woke uh you even have to have a chin yeah don't have one I'll mail your chin to me

32:05.120 --> 32:12.960
and I'll call you a hero on tumblr I'm not fucking I'm fucking beyond woke I'm so woke

32:12.960 --> 32:18.640
like I'm on Adderall um the uh actually I think I forgot to take it that's why that's why the

32:18.640 --> 32:24.720
show sucks um it doesn't it doesn't suck no it sucks it's totally fine I I've I've I've

32:24.720 --> 32:30.880
I've done terrible things before the uh uh but I've been learning to draw via youtube tutorials

32:31.520 --> 32:37.920
I kind of like I never now that is where I go why well because because because it's like it's a

32:37.920 --> 32:43.520
it's a it's a genuine like it's a hobby like I just no requirement I'll have passion for writing a

32:43.520 --> 32:48.880
comic book for 15 years but I think having a hobby is a waste of time well that's because well that

32:48.880 --> 32:55.600
sounds like you you you I'm envious of you because you you you for you obviously both in terms of

32:55.600 --> 33:00.640
your longevity and the quality of your output and your continued and the and the healthy glow in your

33:00.640 --> 33:08.880
eyes um like and your lustrous coat um you you clearly are a person who my therapist would

33:08.880 --> 33:17.440
would say to me see Dan he doesn't turn what he loves into a nightmare so that he can be more

33:17.440 --> 33:22.960
comfortable doing it like he doesn't have a fucked up relationship with what he loves that's all

33:22.960 --> 33:26.880
like that's that's all you got going on so you don't need a hobby good for you what do you do

33:26.880 --> 33:31.600
fuck off well now you make me now I feel terrible the hell Robert you don't have a you don't have a

33:31.600 --> 33:35.920
hobby like a little side thing you do like model airplanes or you like to do like uh you're like

33:35.920 --> 33:42.880
a pet groomer or nothing you just draw on right pretty much yeah yeah I mean I've got the two

33:42.880 --> 33:49.600
kids so uh that takes up all the non-working time so yeah so yeah so you're spending time with my

33:49.600 --> 33:53.840
kids is that a hobby does that count no that's kind of a hobby that makes drawing and writing a hobby

33:53.840 --> 33:59.200
probably but but for you a lucrative one that lets you have yeah it is definitely the old cliche of

34:00.160 --> 34:06.560
man I can't wait for those vacations over so I can get back to work yeah yeah god fuck you

34:06.560 --> 34:14.880
no that is good I mean and and and and everybody that I say like I want to retire you know they go

34:14.880 --> 34:20.560
like you're never gonna retire end in a fist fight yeah yeah the world's slowest saddest

34:21.600 --> 34:29.280
least necessary fist fight which is both like no one got hurt it just they fought for a long time

34:29.280 --> 34:34.800
and no one got hurt it descends into a shoulder rub that's not even that good I was I was I was in

34:34.800 --> 34:40.080
a Laguna beach bar fight and that's exactly what it was I Cody was so impressed he's like I can't

34:40.080 --> 34:45.280
believe you got up and intervened I'm like no one it was that's like jury duty there's a there was a

34:45.280 --> 34:50.880
an old guy and then like this like middle-aged guy like I couldn't tell which one voted for Trump

34:50.880 --> 34:56.240
I had no idea obviously someone did or this wouldn't be happening they were like yelling they started

34:56.240 --> 35:01.520
yelling at each other and then and then at one point they both stood up and they're like me and

35:01.520 --> 35:08.080
the other two dudes in the bar both like like rolling our eyes like got up off the bar still was

35:08.080 --> 35:13.680
like really slowly and shuffled over there to break up two guys who were never actually going

35:13.680 --> 35:21.280
to fight because they're both so old it was a Laguna beach bar fight and the funny thing is

35:21.280 --> 35:25.360
like Cody was like she's like wait I can't tell which one was the good guy which one was the bad

35:25.360 --> 35:30.400
guy so she was trying to like eavesdrop on the loudmouth guy to see was he a loudmouth liberal

35:30.400 --> 35:36.640
that pissed off the old coot conservative or is that an old hippie who whose side we're on and

35:36.640 --> 35:42.880
is he like some kind of like flashy like loud drunk like a right-wing guy who's feeling his

35:42.880 --> 35:49.120
oats we couldn't and and and she kept she kept trying to be able to tell from the things she was

35:49.120 --> 35:55.440
overhearing him say what which one he was and it was kind of like it's Pat sketch because

35:55.440 --> 36:01.920
you can say things like well now you sound like a libertarian and we still don't know what you are

36:02.960 --> 36:10.000
you're just equally outraged anyways at that it's it was funny at the time but it's it's really

36:10.000 --> 36:19.840
not the best use of your time what else happened let me ask you next oh uh there's another walking

36:19.840 --> 36:31.280
dead question when it first came on uh fx i were they were advertising it i'm like i'm so excited

36:31.280 --> 36:42.000
mc uh really i want i want i've seen him watch it like he has watched american movie classics that

36:42.000 --> 36:47.520
doesn't make any sense i i agree i've seen him read the comic they don't make television shows

36:47.520 --> 36:53.200
what other television show have they i know okay the uh never seen the classic movie the walking

36:53.200 --> 37:02.160
dead tv show when i saw the the um when i saw the ads coming i think like an idiot i was like oh i'm

37:02.160 --> 37:09.280
so excited i'm gonna catch up on the i'm gonna reread the the trade paperbacks that i have

37:10.160 --> 37:16.800
which it was a dumb move because the first like season was a pretty faithful like rigorously

37:16.800 --> 37:20.960
faithful adaptation to the point where i was like so you're reading the comic you were bored

37:20.960 --> 37:25.200
i was like i was like well no i was like well i was reading the comics in advance of watching the

37:25.200 --> 37:30.640
show like because i was like watching the tv show i was like well i already know that guy's racist

37:30.640 --> 37:37.040
i read that that's all then i got excited when it started deviating i was like oh they're gonna

37:37.040 --> 37:41.520
deviate was there a big conversation about that and what side were you on and how did that go

37:41.520 --> 37:45.760
no i mean it's i mean it's it's a weird it's a whole it's a weird process because i'm in the

37:45.760 --> 37:52.880
writer's room a lot more on the earlier seasons and uh you know they're talking about like well

37:52.880 --> 37:56.720
we can't do this because that's that didn't really work oh oh sorry robert i mean you know it worked

37:56.720 --> 38:02.480
fine but you know the you know so it's like a little awkward sometimes but uh but i mean i really

38:02.480 --> 38:07.520
enjoyed it and and it's uh it's very humbling to be in a room of writers that are picking apart

38:07.520 --> 38:12.400
you know the thing that you wrote and and trying to turn into a tv show i think the only way i was

38:12.400 --> 38:17.840
able to keep my sanity is because uh you know i started walking up when i was 23 and then you

38:17.840 --> 38:22.800
know i'm like 28 or so when the show started and so it was stuff that was like five years of my

38:22.800 --> 38:26.560
rear view and so i could be like yeah look that didn't work i wasn't you were you were at yeah

38:26.560 --> 38:32.000
that probably kept you from punching them in the face that's just the self-loathing sure right yeah

38:32.000 --> 38:38.640
but uh but then and i was always the one that would push to change things because uh i don't

38:38.640 --> 38:45.280
know if i'm an asshole or or what but i i i mean i i love being surprised and it's one of the things

38:45.280 --> 38:49.600
i i enjoy most out of my entertainment like when i don't see something coming it's that's when i'm

38:49.600 --> 38:56.240
like oh that's the best stuff i wish i had paid an actor to be dressed as a zombie i'm like come

38:56.240 --> 39:01.840
lumbering out here right now behind you just to scare me yeah i ain't scared of zombies but uh it

39:01.840 --> 39:06.160
wouldn't surprise you it probably happens all the time on these panels we could have had rob come

39:06.160 --> 39:12.960
out there and do a zombie bit yeah coming yeah instead of doing this rob what's going on like

39:12.960 --> 39:19.520
you you're you're uh let's bring rob on well you let's bring rob's rob on but so anyway

39:22.080 --> 39:28.720

40:35.120 --> 40:40.400
sad than than all the laguna beach anecdotes in the world would make you you'd be you'd be you'd be

40:40.400 --> 40:47.680
incensed yeah what's going on with you well i don't know what what do you mean i got one of those

40:47.680 --> 40:51.360
bidet toilet seats that you have but it won't fucking great it won't fit on my toilet you got

40:51.360 --> 40:56.160
like a bidet doesn't fit on my toilet it didn't fit on the toilet you gotta make that when do you use

40:56.160 --> 41:03.360
a bidet come on went to a hotel that had a boat uh bidet whoa and uh did not enjoy that do you

41:03.360 --> 41:10.000
have a fancy bathroom no not really whoo just too wet so so you there's an attachment you can put

41:10.000 --> 41:14.240
on your existing toilet you take your toilet it's a new toilet seat that you are that's comes with

41:14.240 --> 41:20.080
the toilet then you put the new one on it's got a heated it's a heated seat because i've been on

41:20.080 --> 41:24.560
yours and yours is like this weird like it plays you music it like it massages you there's a lot

41:24.560 --> 41:31.600
of buttons on that yeah yeah i need to upgrade need to uh you get to the bidet apple store and

41:31.600 --> 41:38.000
upgrade that shit get me some get me some new apps you know what you guys share as artists is a

41:38.000 --> 41:46.640
is a very storyboard style whoa thank you dan thanks so i don't care much for bidets

41:46.640 --> 41:52.400
so what happens is you you put a thing on you take your toilet seat off you put this piece

41:52.400 --> 41:57.680
of machinery on it and there's a little hose that shoots water up your butt yeah it's more of a nozzle

41:57.680 --> 42:01.760
it's a nozzle it's like an upside down spray bottle how do you work on the aim of those things i mean

42:01.760 --> 42:07.440
i was at a hotel i imagine you can adjust but you gotta rock it back and forth you gotta get like

42:07.440 --> 42:12.720
oh you move during it that's interesting because i was doing wrong you don't have to but i do

42:12.720 --> 42:20.000
you're a master i was in india recently and a lot of bidets a lot of bidets but not as we stayed

42:20.000 --> 42:26.000
in very like um you know because it was an english colony for so long very very westernized hotels

42:26.000 --> 42:29.520
so there were no bidets in hotels we stayed at but a couple of the places we went to

42:30.160 --> 42:36.240
like nice restaurants in nice areas in the men's room i'm assuming the women's room too

42:36.240 --> 42:40.720
there was just a hose like a garden hose with it's like a nozzle a squeeze nozzle yeah and it's just

42:40.720 --> 42:45.520
laying on the floor next to the toilet and like that's and there's no paper that's not clean there's

42:45.520 --> 42:50.240
no paper at all so you're supposed to get up and just hose off your butt and then you got a wet

42:50.240 --> 42:56.080
butt and you pull your pants up i i i would you or do you just drip dry like there's people outside

42:56.080 --> 42:58.880
waiting to hose it off there but you just bring you just bring naan into the bathroom with you

42:58.880 --> 43:05.280
you're pretty so you see now that's i see i i i i bring some pop it down is that not okay i bring

43:05.280 --> 43:11.520
the pop it down because it's a little lighter and flakier that must that must be they must be

43:11.520 --> 43:17.760
that must be some good indian food if they got like hoses for your butt yeah yeah it's food so

43:17.760 --> 43:25.120
spicy you're going to want to hose your asshole yeah but given the choice between a rule of toilet

43:25.120 --> 43:31.440
paper and it but you can't have both given a choice you choose water i'm talking about restrooms at

43:31.440 --> 43:38.000
nice restaurants that had no paper at all anywhere and like you couldn't even go and get a paper tell

43:38.000 --> 43:42.640
them bring it into the thing with you you had a hose on the ground right that presumably everybody

43:42.640 --> 43:47.760
that's ever taken a poop there has recently used well and you gotta you don't stick it up your butt

43:47.760 --> 43:54.160
you stand up and you rinse your asshole off but like it looks it looks it looked dry so people

43:54.160 --> 43:57.840
know how to do that without spraying down the whole building well because they know they probably

43:57.840 --> 44:02.800
they haven't had a toilet paper culture for like from rich to poor like they just don't use toilet

44:02.800 --> 44:10.400
paper yeah but then you i somebody help me out go into a hole into the toilet bowl have you seen

44:10.400 --> 44:19.040
slump dog millionaire it goes to india yeah but but like it didn't look wet and people had been

44:19.040 --> 44:23.920
pooping in there i i mean obviously they know how to do it delicately but then i my main thing is

44:23.920 --> 44:30.800
now you got a wet butt and a wet crotch and then you just pull up your wet poopy drawers and go

44:30.800 --> 44:34.240
but they're not poopy they just go back to have desserts ostensibly they're just wet come on

44:34.240 --> 44:39.680
we've all taken a big giant shit and then gotten right in the shower right at least once god yeah

44:39.680 --> 44:45.120
you have to just for the thrill of it you just go like you know what not wiping yeah gotta gotta

44:45.120 --> 44:52.160
take a shower anyway no no no i've never done that then i haven't either no you haven't done that

44:52.160 --> 45:00.480
not not me not it not you kirkman come on look at us oh i've i've taken a bad i've taken a shit

45:00.480 --> 45:04.720
so bad that i then had to take a shower afterwards even after i've cleaned up just yeah but that's

45:04.720 --> 45:12.000
after no way there's no way i've handled this how old are you kids uh there'll be uh there's

45:12.000 --> 45:17.840
eleven and eight they're about to turn nine and twelve so so both uh boys older boy younger girl

45:17.840 --> 45:24.720
oh see i shit in the shower so and then i i don't know the worst sound we can go to the toilet

45:24.720 --> 45:30.080
bowl and we can unpack my reaction for next 30 minutes with the toilet bowl water i mean even

45:30.080 --> 45:36.720
if we don't go to the creepy creepy place it's just a dumb reaction to have it's a standard biological

45:36.720 --> 45:42.800
amount of diversity yeah two kids one's a boy one's a girl oh i'm gonna give you the old seven

45:42.800 --> 45:48.800
ten split a i'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt that that to me that was you making a sound

45:48.800 --> 45:53.760
to cover the fact that you could not care less about my children and you regretted asking that

45:53.760 --> 45:58.800
question no i didn't i didn't ask about kids i don't care about kids you're half right it was it was

45:58.800 --> 46:06.320
a it was a standard uh bad interviewer nervous tick like i need to have a reaction with uh but

46:06.320 --> 46:10.560
i didn't regret asking it because i'd love to talk to a genius about having kids because

46:10.560 --> 46:14.880
i it's uh i'm not to put you on the spot but i'm sure you're gonna say things that no one's ever

46:14.880 --> 46:24.240
said let's hear it how old are you when you had your first child uh oh uh 27 oh that's respectable

46:24.240 --> 46:30.080
edge yeah it's a solid third baseline and and and my wife hates it when i talk about it but you

46:30.080 --> 46:37.600
know i'm from kentucky and um you know everybody has kids when they're like 21 22 23 so we were

46:37.600 --> 46:44.240
we were we were late late in the game at 27 yeah yeah yeah us to wisconsin same thing i mean it's

46:44.240 --> 46:52.720
kind of like you not you know basically like the two cities that dinosaurs and uh king kong don't

46:52.720 --> 46:57.680
attack in the movies wait or do attack those are the only exceptions everywhere else i think people

46:57.680 --> 47:03.600
get married pretty pretty quickly after high school yeah you know it's the king kong and the

47:03.600 --> 47:11.440
godzilla factor that really um now that's not keeps uh why do you keep having him on yeah

47:12.160 --> 47:17.760
yeah thank you i keep asking the same thing the whole time i keep thinking he'll bring my ipad back

47:17.760 --> 47:23.040
i think i keep getting texts from levy like oh are you coming are you bringing are you coming

47:23.040 --> 47:28.240
rob can i are you still starting are you gonna you're gonna be here you're gonna be here you're

47:28.240 --> 47:34.240
still starting are you on your way are you still coming right it's because we're worried about you

47:34.240 --> 47:38.800
we had to we had to have Schrab on for uh the third installment do you think that psychologically

47:38.800 --> 47:42.720
the reason i'm 44 and haven't had children is because i grew up in a place that's so likely

47:42.720 --> 47:48.000
to get king kong or godzilla or meteor attacked because i know it's bleak yeah well why have a

47:48.000 --> 47:53.040
child if you know that any moment you're gonna get armageddon godzilla yeah timie lee jones is

47:53.040 --> 47:57.040
going to be on your doorstep screaming about something new york and los angeles more so

47:57.040 --> 48:01.840
los angeles than new york geostorm because new york has people that lift things and fish for

48:01.840 --> 48:06.400
things but you know like these two big cities people go to them because they're like still

48:06.400 --> 48:12.160
not given up on their fucking like i'm gonna i'm still a baby i'm gonna i'm gonna have a big

48:12.160 --> 48:16.400
pacifier in my mouth it's gonna be made a solid gold and sometimes i can take till you're 45

48:17.360 --> 48:24.240
it's interesting to be twice the age of the average Rick and Morty viewer and to be like

48:24.240 --> 48:30.240
oh this person would be my kid if i had kids when my wisconsin dna kind of

48:31.680 --> 48:36.640
said that it was time to have kids like this would be my kid and he's an idiot

48:38.640 --> 48:45.040
and he likes your show that does not make you smart it doesn't make you stupid but it doesn't

48:45.040 --> 48:50.800
make you smart no no it's a popular show a lot of idiots love it i like it isn't your friend church

48:50.800 --> 48:56.480
isn't ross your buddy i'm not sure ross marquine somebody said that one of my friends makes it

48:56.480 --> 49:00.320
somebody was like calling me out because i like i made fun of some kid that said some shitty crap

49:00.320 --> 49:04.960
about my girlfriend like you know it says go whatever go ahead make fun of my girlfriend

49:04.960 --> 49:09.040
or make fun of me for being she's too hot to be with me so she must be a gold digger good

49:09.040 --> 49:15.040
look uh first amendment uh engaged and now i get to fucking abuse you verbally like with all of my

49:15.040 --> 49:19.920
kevin spacey fucking venom gland that i never get to inject into a warner brothers executive so

49:19.920 --> 49:25.280

49:25.280 --> 49:30.400
yourself and then the 40 000 like comments of whoa you didn't put them on blast must be nice

49:30.400 --> 49:38.400
to have 200 000 followers i don't give a fuck if any of you live or die stop telling me how to

49:38.400 --> 49:43.120
react what happened what happened just now but here's something well i'm trying to i think you

49:43.120 --> 49:47.920
should keep that ipad and zombies are followers in a way aren't they trying to get to my point i'm

49:47.920 --> 49:52.320
gonna pay for it trying to get to my point so it says somebody somebody then somebody i noticed

49:52.320 --> 49:57.680
that it's like i went back to one of the instagram things uh and i'm like looking through the aftermath

49:57.680 --> 50:03.920

why it is that you have such shitty fans in response to me being shitty to one of my shitty fans

50:50.400 --> 50:55.600
like in other words oh i'm such a toxic person that i'm gonna go ahead and tell a kid to go

56:29.120 --> 56:33.760
no no i i was on the internet today no that was a wall of impression like i was impressed

56:34.320 --> 56:37.840
like that's it is it is exciting when you go to a foreign country and they actually like you meet

56:37.840 --> 56:41.520
somebody and they actually do like the thing that you would think would be stereotypical

56:41.520 --> 56:45.280
like i was in a car i probably said this before a long time ago in Harmontown but i got into a

56:45.280 --> 56:50.160
car when i got to like naples i was driving and we were talking and he's like how many people live

56:50.160 --> 56:57.040
in uh in los angeles i don't know like 25 million he goes mama mia and i he was in the front and i

56:57.040 --> 57:00.400

57:00.400 --> 57:04.560

57:04.560 --> 57:11.520
got off i got a like a few for real oh la la they really fucking say it they say they say oh la la

57:11.520 --> 57:18.000

57:18.000 --> 57:23.200
they say mama mia in italy italy yes and then they say in france they say oh la la so bloody

57:23.200 --> 57:28.480

57:28.480 --> 57:33.520
these doors march 7th i don't see any what's so hypnotic about the oblivion song and in china

57:33.520 --> 57:40.640
they go oh hell no i don't see any zombies in here no zombies no no i decided that they don't

57:40.640 --> 57:45.920
come in till later all right well let's give it a chance try to change it up a little bit i mean

57:45.920 --> 57:50.720
i'm in a rut but i'm not what's the logline on oblivion song can you can you reveal that oh the

57:50.720 --> 57:58.480
logline is terrible uh no it's a complicated idea but it's basically there's like 300 000 people in

57:58.480 --> 58:04.320
philadelphia that get uh sent to another dimension basically a large land mass in philadelphia

58:04.320 --> 58:09.840
transposes with the large land mass in another dimension and then uh our main character uh

58:09.840 --> 58:15.440
nathan cole is a scientist who is tasked with uh trying to rescue those people but when our story

58:15.440 --> 58:20.240
takes place it's been 10 years they've stopped finding people they've lost funding and he is

58:20.240 --> 58:24.640
still going over there and uh doing it because his brother is lost in that dimension so he's

58:24.640 --> 58:28.320
going to get his other people from the other dimension now populating that part of philadelphia

58:28.320 --> 58:33.840
there's no people in the other dimension it's a very primitive uh uh alien world with like monsters

58:33.840 --> 58:37.280
and all kind of stuff it's got some monsters rolling around yeah yeah and so they're going

58:37.280 --> 58:40.880
where it did 10 years ago and they've all been cleaned out and there's like a museum and stuff

58:40.880 --> 58:44.400
they're walking down to the strip and getting some fucking promoting brothers and fucking

58:44.400 --> 58:50.240
that's Pittsburgh sorry it's like a land of decay and if your mouth is a land of decay you should

58:50.240 --> 58:56.080
brush it and the way that you can ensure your brush won't go soft uh as you use it at which point

58:56.080 --> 59:01.680
it becomes so ineffective that most dentists say you may as well stop hit yourself in the face with

59:01.680 --> 59:06.960
a hammer then keep brushing with your expired shitty target toothbrush go to the good the good

59:06.960 --> 59:14.000
people at quip uh they mail you a new toothbrush had every fucking statistical period when you

59:14.000 --> 59:19.600
need it now it's it's a millennial toothbrush it's time to put gingivitis on blast yeah

59:20.800 --> 59:26.240
you know quip is the toothbrush of choice that oblivion song headquarters oh really yeah keep

59:26.240 --> 59:33.840
your mouth out of it you and frit fritt and end of the league you guys that's not okay yeah it's

59:33.840 --> 59:38.560
kind of it's not okay to call him fritt and end his name is lorenzo i saw somebody it's fritt and

59:38.560 --> 59:46.640
italian uh there's no way that uh annalisa leone your colorist is related to leo leone the famous

59:46.640 --> 59:52.320
children's book author who left us i don't believe so yeah it's probably a common name yeah yeah

59:52.960 --> 59:59.440
it's just leone's like growing on trees over in italy yeah probably so how many issues do you have

59:59.440 --> 01:00:05.840
and what what what uh i mean how many do you how many what character are people going to be cosplaying

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:10.640
at the next comic con oh boy uh there's a cool character named keith that comes in an issue

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.160
three that looks awesome are you going to be right back on the monthly schedule where you're

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.920
just like i gotta write an oblivion song this month yeah i mean we've actually been working on that

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.560
book in secret for almost two years so that you know i can keep on the monthly schedule without

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:27.360
wanting to kill myself that's awesome uh we've we're working on working on issue 12 right now

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:32.960
but issue one comes out in uh on march 7th and so we're basically a year ahead of schedule

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:40.240
is your 11 year old smart yes would you tell me if he was stupid yeah he's not listening to this

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:47.040
yeah i would just ask you to edit it out later right right as he is he like is he a nerd he is uh

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:51.520
yeah i mean he plays the video games he doesn't do the sports and how old's the daughter uh she's

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:58.320
eight will be nine so they're both like asking a lot of questions about the birds and clouds and

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.920
stuff not really they're answering my questions about birds and clouds and stuff but uh no i mean

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.920
they're you know they're very creative uh my my daughter what don't you know about birds and clouds

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.320
no i'm just i'm just saying they really i don't know they're know-it-alls they're like yeah they're

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:17.840
not coming to you how aware are they of your like celebrity status are you like like what like the

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:22.400
the role you play in that part is frustrating i mean they're very aware i mean much more aware

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.720
now that they're in school because the other kids in school like hear things from their parents or

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.520
older siblings or whatever and so like my son comes home from school and is like oh i hear uh

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.160
you're pretty uh pretty popular and i'm like what are you talking about eddie van halen's

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:42.000
kid says my dad's some kind of mucky muck exactly well there was one cool there was one day where

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.840
he came home and he was like dad the the middle school kids found out who my dad was and they

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:56.640
were talking to me it was totally awesome like all these like 13 14 15 year olds were talking to

01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:02.320
him and so he was like the king of the school for a day so that was nice but but yeah they uh the

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:08.880
frustrating part is like i was on the conan o'brien show and so uh i go uh i'm totally on this talk

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:13.200
show you guys should watch the segment and uh and i put them on the couch you know because

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.240
if i was a kid and my dad had come home and been like i'm on television i would have jumped up and

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:24.400
been like what are you kidding me like holy crap you know i would have lost my mind and my kids

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:29.840
like yeah okay whatever and then i turn it on and they're like okay can we go do we have to

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:34.000
watch this whole thing i was like oh what the hell like they don't they don't care well they're

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.400
probably either they don't care because you're enough without that which is it's normal to that

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:45.440
right like they're like oh yeah they've seen you on yeah g4 i've been on talking for 30 years yeah

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:50.080
they're like we can here at Harmontown give you a beat and you can put your kids on blast right

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:57.840
now if you want that would go horribly just i want to i want to make that offer to anyone out there

someone it's kind of like you know what this is this is about the the violin world yes here's

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:30.960
something i don't understand the violin move on yeah it's already sarcasm but then it undercuts

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:38.960
itself by being genuine sarcasm i'm playing the world's smallest violin for you it's like when

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:45.760

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:50.960
playing the world's biggest violin yeah yeah like you always say like it's sarcasm but it's a small

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:56.640
violin you've shrunk it down like your sarcasm is i can't even see it i think it comes more down to

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:01.600
not not the people not understanding the like irony is that most parents are really bad at

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.720
spacework so like if you did right that's what i was gonna say you couldn't that requires more

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:36.720
they're making french fries and there's all these little like shaved ends and there was just all

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.880
there was all this potato debris they kept just throwing away or getting true sitting like pig

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:46.000
farms and like a cattle feed and some genius goes hey let's fucking throw some oil on that

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.320
shit and put them in a little weird barrel shaped cylinders and they're fucking like little potato

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:56.400
hot dogs it's it's the it's potato debris and and it's great it's what it's that's why they're

01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:02.400
like the underdog of the potato world they're pretty good the only the only peanuts that are

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:08.480
worse than mr goodbar peanuts are the ones that become crushed nuts like that they use as

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:14.000
condiments can you imagine what those fuckers did wrong this black panther movie is really like

much when the armored rhinos come out you get ready yeah you go see it yeah oh man i haven't seen it

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:34.880

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:54.400
that was to burn up the top 10 yeah but this is a difference it's it's a good movie that's burning

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:58.720
up the charts and in fact what's the number can you give us the top five on the on the burned

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:11.840
starting at the charts number four getting a little medium hot black panther again is uh

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:19.280
number three getting lukewarm is black panther number number two here comes black panther

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:25.040
getting this whole thing getting hot and now number one black panther completely burning up all five

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:32.080
slots of the charts go to the top marvel's burning up the charts it's a good movie people are telling

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:36.560
me it's good movie sounds like black panther's burning up the black panther only charts people

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:41.200
are starting to say that yeah people are really starting to say that it's becoming well known

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:46.560
armored rhinos that cool yeah it's fun you've seen it is that a spoiler am i going to be

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:51.360
bummed out to know oh spoiler you're gonna you're gonna be like oh that's why they keep on setting

01:13:51.360 --> 01:14:00.160
up all these rhino horn shaped doors the protagonist is an armorer who keeps making

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:06.240
all these strange hieroglyphs about a beast there probably is some poacher justice porn in it right

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:11.840
because it takes place all in africa in lakanda like which is a oh there's no poacher that like

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:17.760
has like a just a vibranian weight fall on his head while he's like about to shoot an elephant

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:22.080
i guess they touch on human trafficking you think porn hub has a porn number as a tag for poacher

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:28.320
justice of course poacher justice porn poacher justice porn probably see the poacher stuff for

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:40.800
the sequel yeah go ahead drop a beat don't drop a beat i will pick it up and put it it's what kanda

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:50.240
is a is a african nation that has they had like an area 51 style crash or something so they had

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:55.120
they had started that way they had early access to vibrania yeah for the beginning of society

01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:01.760
they kind of have it so like they've always evolved with this kind of better technology in theory

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:07.760
that's why they're they're like future future style it's a fun idea great great can anyone explain

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:16.240
the the thing because i all i see all i all i'm catching third fourth fifth so societal hand is

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:27.040
the idea that that detractors of the movie that are obsessed with that like pointing out that

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:32.320
wakanda is not real i don't quite i don't understand is that it is that just a is that just a thing

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:37.200
that people are pretending that people care about or is there like an actual like why does that

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:45.200
what i'm just it's a weird one i don't weird one to pick for superhero movies oh that place

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:50.880
isn't real why is that why isn't it a place to go i can't suspend my disbelief on a place name

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:55.840
i've never heard of gotham is that well whatever i guess i just have a bunch of rhetorical

01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:01.120
questions that were probably just fan flames let's hear the top five top five questions top

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:07.760
five Dan Harmon's top five rhetorical question number five starting with number three oh

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:17.200
shit well are you asking that because you want africa to be worse off than it is number two

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:27.360
are you worried africa will get a good rap number five uh i i have you noticed the total

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:34.880
absence of a hogwarts in your neighborhood number one number one are you racist just say

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:39.600
you're racist and we can be friends and i'll have a racist friend like i will just get through

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:44.560
your white racism i'm i'm an alcoholic i we all have problems great question number four

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.080
does there even need to be a number four

01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:01.120
yes there does that's it well yeah it was meta that was good is there ever any meta

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:06.880
moments in walking dead comics does uh doesn't even ever look at the uh panel camera and go

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:13.040
make see the more like uh every issue you're not going to like the next page

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:18.960
yeah like just to the camera i did do a thing recently uh i'm going to spoil recent issues

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:27.280
of walking dead just so i have something to talk about um because uh uh well just just stop listening

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.120
if you don't want recent issues they get out of the present i know that well no they come to a new

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.120
community and and machone who's a character that's been in the book for a very long time finds out

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:40.000
that her daughter is alive she walks the she walks the she's the one who learned the technique of

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:47.280
cutting off their jaws and walking them around as a as a walker camouflage that is her uh and so uh

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:53.120
so she she finds her daughter and it's like two straight issues of all positive like happy cliff

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.680
hangers and she's reunited with her daughter and it's all happy cliff hangers yeah it's all good news

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:02.720
because there's you know it was like 175 so we've done 174 issues where all the cliff hangers are

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.320
all just misery right you know like this guy's getting his hand cut off and then you're like this

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:11.040
guy's mom finally ended one where someone's shaking a gift box and it sounds like a puppy but it could

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:16.720
be a kitten and then it's a puppy and they're like hey and so i was convinced that people would be

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:21.280
pissed off and so when when we revealed that the daughter is actually alive she works at a bakery

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:26.160
and she comes out holding a cake and she sees her mother who she's thought was dead for the last

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:32.320
many many years live in the zombie apocalypse and she drops the cake that she's holding right so uh

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:38.080
so i was like if people really hate this they'll say that instead of the comic jumping the shark in

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:42.160
this issue they'll be like this is the issue where they drop the cake right and i was trying to i was

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:49.280
trying to create my own like right like nuking the fridge you know but i give people a happy cliff

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:54.320
hanger is a hopeful cliffhanger that's that it's a it's a you can still have a cliffhanger but

01:18:54.320 --> 01:19:01.280
it can be hinged on hope it's kind of an interesting concept because correct me if i'm wrong but a

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:07.040
hopeful cliffhanger actually is you're still laying uh it's just a question of whether you're

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:14.720
saying oh shit something horrible right did happen we'll see you next week or saying oh

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:21.600
shit i just found out my daughter is alive but i haven't talked to her yet tune in yeah and well

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:27.920
and hopefully after you know 15 years of the walking dead when i present a character like

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:32.640
machone with a living daughter the audience is going oh man is she gonna die soon like is this

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:37.040
gonna get taken away is this gonna get ugly quickly like you know hopefully people are

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:46.080
having those worries we'll see maybe they're the walking dead the readers the viewers you

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:51.440

the thing that frustrates me is uh and i swear to god it what it was for altruistic reasons

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:08.560
because it was like more like well i weep for our children kind of thing it was frustrating to me for

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:18.080
a while now i'm jaded but it was frustrating to me for a while when 20 mid kids in their mid 20s

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:28.480
otherwise known as grown ass humans um uh like who clearly like have successfully been conned by

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:36.800
the society that i grandfathered into like into thinking that television is like a

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:42.720
a water or gas company or something that's it because they simply have a problem with the

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:47.040
temperature of it coming out of their tap which means they're never going to create anything

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:53.040
and i know that i'm not as amazing as i am i know that the fact that i ended up in hollywood

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:58.400
making my own shit had must have had something to do with the fact that some point along the

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:04.640
line somebody told me in some way that resonated with me you know you could do it too you could

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:10.160
just do it and i feel like when i read i used to feel sad when i would read certain shit like

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:16.320
where i'd be like wow you think tv is toothpaste and you don't know that your parents buy your

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:26.800
toothpaste like you think that you're just mad at 25 that the tv came out wrong and you're not even

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:35.440
ashamed that you're saying like horrible shit to someone that you that is designed semantically

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:42.160
to provoke their suicide over the fact that something wasn't written by you because you

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:46.640
don't know you could write yeah and that used to make me sad but then i turned 45 and i was like

01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:54.080
cha-ching enslaved population like then they voted for trump and then i was like stay dumb

01:23:54.080 --> 01:24:00.080
fucking let me give me five years stay this stupid let me out of here i don't agree with

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:06.480
any of your social security checks while you're at it's braver than me i commend that i yeah but

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:15.920
i went when i was 30 when i was your age uh when my kid was only 11 uh i uh i i i would i would be

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:22.640
like this is such a bummer man like like like it's not that i'm smarter than kids that it's like

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.720
it's it's just like i had a school paper they don't have a school paper if they had a school

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.360
paper they wouldn't be saying this shit or they would have been saying it in the school paper

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:34.560
and you never would have seen it and they would have said it in school paper and it would have

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:39.120
activated them and they would have become a tv writer but instead they like go to like english

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:43.680
class and english classes here's how you pass your sat's maybe unless you're going into the funnel

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:48.320
that will take you to mcdonald's here you go oh you're gonna say um by the way enjoy watching

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:52.640
television which is created by a mysterious race of people in california that would no one has any

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:57.040
idea how they got out there but we don't know they're all liberal cucktards that just uh are

01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:01.360
ungrateful and it's like and it's like no one at any point says to these kids in the hallway by

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:07.200
their locker by the way you could you could just move out there so you think you think that that

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:14.000
there's a there's a lack of awareness in the general population that they could be a writer there's

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:20.960
a lack of of creative arts education there's there was a genuine in general 20 year pullback

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:29.040
on in our educational institutions particularly the public ones of on one side um uh what do you

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:35.360
call it um because i don't fraternize with blue collar people but um the work programs the trades

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:40.880
the trades like the internships where you could be if you were gonna be a mechanic and you were

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:45.200
good at it high school wouldn't tell you you were a worthless piece of shit and you should go to rehab

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:50.640
they would tell you you could be a mechanic and like place you in a fucking mechanic job or and

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:56.240
then on the other hand also you if you're if you're gonna go to college but possibly maybe don't

01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:00.400
know exactly what you're supposed to do that like oh there's a thing called poetry there's a thing

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:06.720
called fucking like thinking about shit there's there's plays there's a lot of poetry yes well

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:12.080
you don't have to fucking Schrab me i don't know what i'm talking about that's not what's

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:19.440

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:05.680
gray chest hair and i gotta i have a gray nipple hair over here that that was very distinguished

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:12.000
yeah i think you're distinguished i don't know if you're gray nipple hair if anything your gray

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.760
nipple hair is a quitter i gray hair makes you distinguish the gray hairs themselves let's not

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:22.000
let's say i got the feeling that the other nipple hairs were looking at that gray nipple hair like

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.960
where would it go a nice try jack yeah exactly yeah give us thank you it's good to be on the same page

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:16.160
this kid no jamaica his zombies are i re yeah it is yeah it's a twist i do still enjoy zombie uh

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:22.320
zombie stuff i i just recently uh rewatched uh day of the dead which is classic great um very

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:28.480
excited about that it had been far too long wait the uh the classic or the remake the oh the classic

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:33.520
i i did did you i had seen the room i've been obsessive about the day of the dead i was like i

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:38.480
would tell people like that's that's the best like the Romero trilogy it's so great that it builds

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:44.480
from work a day schmucks in a black and white house going like what the fuck's happening

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:51.200
to the next tier of civilization which is these slightly more privileged cops and and reporters

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:55.760
like holing up in a shopping mall and then that the culmination is this like oh my god this isn't

01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:02.400
even life anymore it's scientists and soldiers they're literally buried but the but the only

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:06.720
thing i noticed because i kept telling dakotio is like you gotta see like like first i gotta i gotta

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:11.280
show you these first two movies and then i i kept telling her like yeah the day of the dead and

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:15.680
it's like it's the best it's like in a bunker and it's like crazy and then i watched it again i felt

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:22.160
a little embarrassed in the eyes of the person i was trying to indoctrinate because i was like oh

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:28.160
i forgot there's no zombies in this one like day of the dead it's not it's they come in at the end

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:32.640
and plenty all right well it's got the good it's good i can't tell if you're high-roading me or

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:36.720
medium-roading me you're helping me you're trying to help me out yeah no but you shouldn't have felt

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.800
bad my the most fascinating thing about day of the dead if you guys don't know this is that uh that

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:45.840
wasn't the movie that georgia merrow originally wanted to make he there's a different script

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:50.720
that you can find online for the original day of the dead that was like this massive movie that

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:56.560
had different people live on an island and well he eventually did that right the he never did that

01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:00.560
movie he did another movie that took place on where they're the sky rise and the zombies learned to

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:04.320
land of the dead yeah yeah yeah there was some material i think from that that ended up at land

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:09.520
of the dead i think the dead reckoning was in oh was the i thought i thought i'd yeah i thought that

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:14.000
it's been a while since i've read it wasn't wasn't didn't romero like say like there were certain

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.800
zombies that they were actually being used as weapons like they were had different colorings on

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:22.960
them or do you know yeah like certain zombie i think they were trained to do different things

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:28.240
there's a lot more bubs in the original right right right yeah yeah i mean i think i think like

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:34.720
romero's obsession was with the idea that there was an evolution happening yeah like which i would

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:41.680
say like you know like but i'm not i'm not i'm not my favorite aspect it's it's it's like i don't

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:46.480
need that it's sort of like the wakowski siblings like being in just parts of the matrix trilogy

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:51.280
that you're like oh you look you've earned the right to be obsessive about this but you know when

01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:56.400
colonel sander starts you know him and hawn on stuff i can't understand well i can someone just

01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:01.680
wear sunglasses yeah somebody i'm not smart enough for this i think that i think that comes from the

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:08.240
fact that like night living dad was originally like conceived by russo and and dred romero as

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:14.800
a sequel to omega man like the idea was supposed to be let's let's do because we liked last man on

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:20.160
earth the the vincent price one and if you watch last man on earth at night living dad they feel

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:24.320
like like one's a prequel but like at the last minute well not at the last month they said well

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:30.320
we can't do that let's let's choose a different it can't be vampires let's make them zombies and

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:38.400
they'll eat people instead of doing uh uh drinking blood but in the omega man like the the the the

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:45.120
vampires were slowly taking over the the world and becoming the dominant species so that's kind of

01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:49.440
like what i think he was doing with the zombies the zombies were taking over and they were coming

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:54.320
their own dominant species and the humans were going to be in a sense it's also then a prequel

01:32:54.320 --> 01:33:04.720
to uh daybreakers with steven dwarf all right wasn't that with uh it was about the girls that with

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:10.960
the ski masks and the spring break that go down and it's rob places you know james franco that's

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:16.480
spring breakers not daybreakers is vampires have taken over and they have like a it's a it's a future

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:23.040
vampire society where vampires are the dominant species and humans are it's a very Schrabby thing

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:30.080
like i'm pretty sure you probably have seen it yeah um ski patrol it's not ski patrol i've named

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:36.880
the movie three times now have you seen daybreakers wedding crashers god damn it all of you daybreakers

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:41.280
it's eating hot drinks drink your drink drink your drink damn vampires are people you know but

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:46.480
i've actually seen them but have you had i don't want to get into your politics a bit but like you're

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:51.280
like you know it's like like when you watch day of the dead i left my making america green again

01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:56.720
had at home but go ahead and they've got that like you know that plotting synth score and then

01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:03.200
she's got to go to her meeting with the soldiers it's like isn't that the dread that that scene

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:07.360
and it's early in the movie it's like basically it's the call to adventure because there's nothing

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:11.920
left anymore and it's just the there let's have a meeting and the soldiers are like i want to know

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:17.280
what the fuck is going on and i've got the fucking guns and what the fuck are you eggheads doing and

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:23.360
you know and it's like you're just in a lab coat it's so you it's like it's the liberal nightmare

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:31.200
is like i like oh yeah okay the world's gotten so shitty that you control it and you're a horrible

01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:37.200
person and i have no idea what you're gonna do i only know what the zombies are gonna do and we've

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:43.360
gotten pretty good at controlling them and we'd like that comfort to continue it's a very resonant

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:50.000
for today moment that that conversation because it's like no good guys or bad guys because if you

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:57.200
strain the dumb part of your brain you can relate to the soldiers too they're like give us some results

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:02.480
we have a bunch of assault rifles should we not be like maybe going and finding a new bunker

01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:10.320
when when she goes down when they're like we got to get out of here and they're about to leave and

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:17.600
they go down and uh and nicotero's head is on the on the and he's doing that they find that and she

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:24.160
finds the tape recorder and he's going it's my buckling father you know when frankenstein is

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:29.840
doing all the recording and then she freaks out like oh no oh my god no i never really understood

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:35.520
what was your interpretation of that moment yes somebody this is the best use of robert kirkman

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:41.120
of any podcast i hope no i i i can't remember exactly what he says but it it's mine the big

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:45.920
father it's mine stop stop it father i put it away father remember when yeah i don't know they're

01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:49.440
kind of vaguely implying i know the scene i don't think i ever understood what i didn't know if it

01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:55.440
was somebody said oh he's fucking the zombies in the butt yeah i always thought there was some kind

01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:03.840
of one really really really but honestly i think that is the cinematic akam's razor because why

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:12.000
else is that recording a plot point yeah and i think that if you write backwards from the um if

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:20.320
the answer is it's a revelation that the doctor is fucking the zombie in the 70s the way you'd hear

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:26.080
that is a plot device on a tape recorder would be a bunch of weird improv about like

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:32.720
daddies and as opposed to because it wouldn't be like yeah if your zombie ass feels so good

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:38.800
am i normal living dick that's so tight because it's fucking dead and cold it would be like it

01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:44.240
would be it would have to be veiled all right by robert kirkman i mean if that was it would have to

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:50.640
be veiled like oh he's perverted and perverts talk about their talk about daddy you know while

01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:56.720
they're doing nasty stuff but what's the alternative explanation is just that he's he's crazy or just

01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:02.080
that he's yeah i think that her thing is she's like oh god we've been i've been defending him to the

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:07.200
soldiers this whole time and he's batshit insane he's out of his mind yeah but i would say if that's

01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:13.920
true double beat yeah i'm gonna do it because he's been fucking the zombie she knew that he was off

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:19.440
you know he was she was impatient with him too she just was like she's like a doctor what are we

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:24.320
gonna do the fucking soldiers are getting worse than the zombies and and he's like civilized more

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:31.120
data that's like civilized so wait yeah if if there's a change in story direction as she's

01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:39.680
implying with her shocked reaction it maybe maybe it's because i'm limited but it almost seems like

01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:45.920
it could only mean that she's finding out he was fornicating with the chained up zombie

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:51.200
i feel like there must be another option but yeah i think you might be right i also want to say i

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:55.920
hope that's i wish that wasn't true because i find that again as with the like whole bub evolution

01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:01.760
i find that stuff to be totally like not at all what's appealing about zombie mythology like i i

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:07.120
just don't you know Schrab and i've talked about this endlessly but like it's just like the 70s

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:12.560
had it nailed at a certain point because it was like they're just a sea of death they're stupid

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:18.800
they're slow not that i mind the new run post 9 11 running zombies that shriek like bobcats and

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:25.600
leap from rafters it obviously works for us too and it has its own resonance and either

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:30.560
or situation i mean sometimes i like the movies where they're running and i like it in that movie but

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:36.080
i mean i prefer the slower ones but it's not like oh these movies suck but the idea that the living

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:43.040
are the wild cats the living are the problem because they're living the living are are unpredictable

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:48.720
the living are in and of themselves capable of ruining everything by pushing one button either

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:54.800
in a conversation or on a switchboard whereas these fucking things have perfect order they have

01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:01.520
the american dream slash the russian dream slash like the immortality like and like oh my god they're

01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:07.040
gonna get us but none of them are gonna high five each other or you know and it's like that's why that

01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:14.080
bub aspect of romero's dream always that distracted me too because i was like i don't i know i'm

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:19.760
supposed to like jump up in the theater and go one of them used a gun or learn to use a doorknob

01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:26.880
like like not at all to me the point but yeah i mean i think uh i mean that's one of the aspects

01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:31.600
that you know entertain me and you know engage me to the point that i actually did the walking

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:36.000
dead i love that zombies by and large are a manageable threat you know if you and an

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.320
explorable one i mean you've explored them in so many ways that because you got to just like

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:45.040
right and right you you've got to think over and over again we'll get sick of it eventually but

01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:50.400
but but it's only a matter of time now it's you know it's it's fascinating to think about this

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:55.760
you know unrelenting like sea of danger that's out there and you know if you keep your wits about

01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:00.880
you and you plan well you can do fine but yeah i'm gonna retire like i'm gonna retire i'm gonna

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:08.800
have that death where that doesn't end in that one shot where you go and your intestines are dragged

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:15.680
apart like a taffy bar i'm gonna be the one human being left that doesn't i do i do i do like my

01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:20.560
other favorite thing since i'm this drunk is the beginning of dawn of the dead the 70s one where

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:27.040
it's just like it's such a freaky no not the apartment building that stuff's creepy fun tv

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:33.280
station it's the tv station that she's she's waking up what's her name poly i touch it's

01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:39.360
it's just like it's that she's the eyes in and it's just i love that the black and white one

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:45.280
they worshiped the television because if the television could just tell us what was going on

01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:50.400
and where we should go and then they worship their one car and it's like this perhaps unintentional

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:57.440
but spot-on resonant cultural thing of like it's black and white it's it has its roots in old

01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:04.320
school classic horror films but it's fucking so raw and powerful because it's just fear and it's

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:10.080
just like there's a black guy in the house it's almost a bigger problem than there's dead people

01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:15.440
outside eating brains and the young people understand that that's counterproductive and the

01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:21.120
and the guy with the control of the hammer and nails doesn't and and that if we could just get this tv

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:26.480
working oh the tv's like oh the tv gotta we gotta get it working and that the idea that you fade in

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:33.120
on the sequel at the tv station and it's full color now and it's like it's 70s and everyone's got

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:37.760
bell bottoms and smokes weed but like you're pretending that the narrative just they work in

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:45.920
television where you're learning that this is the apocalypse will not be manageable by anybody

01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:51.840
all right sorry i'm sorry to your children i'm sorry to our listeners have you seen train to

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:58.320
Busan no i'm not oh that was really awesome that was really good it's uh it's uh korean i believe

01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:03.600
zombie movie it's it's really great i recommend that they keep making good zombie movies i i'll

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:08.640
be the first person i could easily just go like too many zombie movies zombies are dead no pun

01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:14.160
intended but like it's it but i'll watch i keep watching them and then it doesn't it's almost

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:18.400
like it's like road movies you know it doesn't matter that there's a thousand of them it's like

01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:23.680
like like there'll just be some swedish zombie movie going waves though i mean there was like

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:28.880
we didn't see zombie movies for a really long time and then they came back and then it's like

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:34.720
vampires you know it's like like undead stuff it goes like i mean why do you think that is that

01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:39.840
like what is it about society that makes us fascinated with like the undead and living

01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:46.400
dead like that for like an amount of time and then we move on to something else i don't know i mean i

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:52.000
think it's uh i don't know you like you got like one that's like super popular you're like a 28 days

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.240
later yeah and then that big gets like a land of the dead a dawn of the dead remake and a bunch of

01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:01.200
different stuff and then it becomes so popular that they start making crappy ones and then people

01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:06.320
are like let's let this rest for a couple months yeah and then then they come back i feel like

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:11.360
that's the cycle i don't think there's any kind of like societal like oh i like feel guilty about

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:18.720
all the horrible things that we're doing overseas and to get iphones and these are

01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:25.040
the dead people coming to get us there's no living nightmare i don't think i don't think most people

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:30.320
are aware of all the things we do to get iphones i don't go to like like a lot of action movies or

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:35.520
like um what the hell you say superhero movies or zombie movies whatever black panther is really

01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:46.240
burning up the charge top six top six oh boy thanks to uh it is a weird genre that's become a giant

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:51.280
thing like there's this inundation of like like zombie stuff like that's that that is weird that

01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:56.560
there's so much of it well it kind of is verging on into the ninth season of walking dead and the

01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:03.360
900th indie movie about like well my relationship's not going that well because there's a zombie attack

01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:10.560
like it's it as many shitty ones as there are sure it's kind of verging on the hip hop thing where

01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:16.560
it's like you wanted to say like if you were waiting for it to be over that rap was a fad and

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:21.920
that it's like at a certain point you just went this is a genre this is not a thing this is not

01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:28.480
something and it's like i i think it's just that we don't have a healthy uh it's our our technology

01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:36.240
means conquering death in in a in a in the get it out of your living room way and so it's like

01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:43.200
although vampires will always have their um attraction they'll be rooted in as has been said

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:51.600
since the silent movie days that it's there's a sexuality there it's about them being humans that

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:59.200
uh seduce and attract and manipulate and things and then there's these there's werewolves but

01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:04.800
we don't werewolves were popular for like a the tiniest stint and it's like that's like a jekyll

01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:10.320
and hide thing where it's like oh i i'm fascinated with the idea that we can all at the drop of a

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:16.160
hat turn into a fucking horrible hulk monster that it just wants to eat your face it's like

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:25.040
it's like it's not a it doesn't take off the way saying everyone's dead everyone that touches you

01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:31.920
will make you dead then you'll be dead but you'll never be dead because you can't be dead you'll

01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:38.160
just want to make other things dead you're you're a consumer in a in a sea of consumption and you'll

01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:44.320
just want to consume and for all you know aren't even if you're not already one of them don't you

01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:52.000
wish you were aren't they winning isn't it just it's just it's been the non-stop like it's like

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.480
waves of it come and go but it's like mounting in its appeal as a genre it's almost like 30 years

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:04.720
from now there'll just be zombie channels zombie zombie you'll just be a i gotta get on that

01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:10.400
but no i mean i think one of the things that does give zombies an edge over werewolves and

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:16.160
vampires and things like that is that you know those stories are always about a person who's

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:22.160
become a vampire a person who's become a werewolf but you don't do stories about the zombies every

01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:26.720
zombie story is about the people in the story and the zombies just window dressing so the genre

01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:30.000
i think lives on because you can be like well there's some soldiers in iraq and they're doing

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.040
this and then zombies show up you know there's some people at a baseball game and new york and

01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:40.400
zombie show like you take any story lachi's looking for buried jewish gold during world war two and

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:45.440
then zombies come out of the cup yeah it's aliens invade and then zombies show up but zombies are

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:50.160
also or at least like the stories that you tell was zombies are also kind of involved in the stories

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:56.640
we have in general anyway right it's like there's still you're trying to find food shelter safety

01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:03.440
it's like it's it's like all the the fears we have about real life apply more with zombies like

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:09.120
someone randomly could just kill you like if you go outside it is dangerous you actually do

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:15.120
have to go find food to survive otherwise your kids will end up dead like it's it's a very extreme

01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:21.120
version of like all these years is not working especially all this capitalist stuff though right

01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:27.200
like the idea it's like we there is no more infrastructure like there are no more gas stations

01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:32.480
or refineries that like like that i think are these fears that come naturally out of like living

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:38.240
living under the shadow of alliances with the with the with a group of people just for survival

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:42.480
could be the thing that kills you that was the thing about donna the dead that was get really

01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:49.120
scary is that like how quickly the system fails you know when this this weird thing that no one

01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:56.720
can explain or take care of happens and everybody turns against each other and you don't trust anybody

01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:02.880
and it's like you know like the cops are shooting each other because they're going crazy zombies

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:07.440
zombies don't have garlic they don't have uh wooden stakes you have to put through their heart

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:16.320
i like they're thwarted by locking the door which is our kryptonite because it means we have to be

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:23.920
with each other it's like fucking great yeah i mean it's uh it's a sartra especially with donna

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:31.360
the day of the dead it's like like the real threat is is the people inside that are like ready to

01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:36.560
shoot you because you're not pulling your weight or or they just want to or they're just like or

01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:40.240
the people that lose their minds and open the door for all the others yeah yeah you think an

01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:44.480
argument could be made the next time you do a panel maybe you could mention this sure you were

01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:50.560
about to get sick and tired of zombies and we really brought you back we kind of we kind of

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:56.080
made another three seasons of walking dead Harmontown saved the walking dead i think so i was definitely

01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:59.840
on the edge but now you guys have got the wheels turning this was sort of an it's the word it's a

01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:06.240
wonderful word we're good till season 16 now yeah so that's good you're welcome to the people

01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:12.240
listening that also were worried yeah rubbers had run dry and then i'm probably gonna need to come

01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:18.720
do this show again in about four or five years so i'm sure it'll be here i'm as you know i am a

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:27.360
fountain of enthusiasm about my own work uh what time is it we have uh we have about ten minutes to

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:34.160
go until we've talked through an entire two hour show yeah it's nine fifty so really we're kind of

01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:39.280
we went too long you know we went too long we're ten minutes shy this feels like we've only just

01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:43.680
gotten started we're supposed to play dnd at the end we're not going to get any dnd all right well

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:49.040
i'm sure sponsors probably can i can i can i can i can i do a little segment right now um yes i i

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:57.920

01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:10.240
it was like have you like the dog did wind up dog or something like that a toy dog do you ever

01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:17.680
you ever take like uh like a toy dog that's like walks around and barks and you put it next to your

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:24.640
dog and and they experience the uncanny valley and just like a what the what the fuck man what is
