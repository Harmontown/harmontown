{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:13.520\nFrom Fantastic Uptown Burbank, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:13.520 --> 00:22.120\nLet's put your groovy chicken hands together for the Game Master extraordinaire, Mr. Spencer\n\n00:22.120 --> 00:34.360\nCrittenden. Hell yeah! Spencer is going to do a little freestyle for us to start the show off.\n\n00:34.360 --> 00:49.360\nHey guys, it's me, Spencer MC. Gonna rap really slow. If I do that, I might keep the flow.\n\n00:49.360 --> 01:00.760\nThat's all I got. I think I'm really bad at rapping. Put your hands together out there in\n\n01:00.760 --> 01:09.280\npodcast land for the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon. Oh yeah. Thank you. The cotton has been\n\n01:09.280 --> 01:16.840\ndropped. Did you hear that freestyle? Yeah, I couldn't hear all of it. I felt like it was good.\n\n01:16.840 --> 01:20.320\nI felt like it was good enough to get us going. There might have to be a slow rap battle right now.\n\n01:20.320 --> 01:29.200\nYeah, I think we're got it. Spencer worked us up. Cut that shit. Oh, you scared. You runnin' scared.\n\n01:29.200 --> 01:38.640\nYeah, the refusal of a call, man. You runnin' from my slow fire. I got no problem admitting that.\n\n01:38.640 --> 01:43.920\nWe've heard my rapping the last six months. I mean, not that it was better before that,\n\n01:43.920 --> 01:51.520\nbut now it's gotten bad and sterile. I like it. It used to be interesting that I was a surgeon\n\n01:51.520 --> 01:56.840\nthat worked with a rusty spoon, and then I washed and cleaned the spoon and replaced it with one\n\n01:56.840 --> 02:03.760\nfrom Target. Creatively speaking, it's still good. Don't mean to offend any Target employees out\n\n02:03.760 --> 02:11.240\nthere. Fight for 15. Minimum wage, socialism. Let's all share money until we die. Just not mine.\n\n02:11.240 --> 02:21.160\nHope you're in the mood for a bad show tonight. What are you going to do? Take your business\n\n02:21.160 --> 02:29.080\nelsewhere? No, I'm going to go give $5 a month. How could it be bad? We got so many good things.\n\n02:29.080 --> 02:36.640\nNo, we got great things, but I just, I should, I said bad to be facetious. And self kind of\n\n02:36.640 --> 02:42.200\ndeprecating. I was, I was going to, what I really meant in my head was kind of a sleepy show, a low\n\n02:42.200 --> 02:46.960\nenergy show. Okay. I'm not real. I'm not feeling, I'm not excited. Remember when I was excited\n\n02:46.960 --> 02:52.240\nabout Killer B's and going into the lake? Oh, would that we could go back to then? By the way,\n\n02:52.240 --> 02:57.720\nsome, by the way, some guy tweeted me, you know, multiple tweet story about how a friend of his,\n\n02:57.720 --> 03:05.160\nhe's named after his best friend's dad who died in a bee attack. They found him drowned with bees\n\n03:05.160 --> 03:11.760\nin his throat. He didn't say this directly, but I'm going to go ahead and assume that he was\n\n03:11.760 --> 03:18.680\ntrying to in your face us like a bee. Like, like, he's trying to save your life. No, he was trying\n\n03:18.680 --> 03:24.000\nto say, I got you. I'm the guy you're looking for. I'm the guy at the story about a bee attack\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:30.200\nwhere someone died because they jumped in water. Doesn't work. And like I told the guy on Twitter,\n\n03:30.200 --> 03:35.640\nlook, you brought your friend's dad's ghost into the courtroom. So I'm not being insensitive to\n\n03:35.640 --> 03:41.840\nhis life. I want your friend and his dad to be respected. But since, since he's exhibit A,\n\n03:41.840 --> 03:48.040\nI have to be clinical about and say, this doesn't prove anything. I know that if Killer B's are\n\n03:48.040 --> 03:56.440\nchasing you and you jump into water, they may be able to wait for you, monitor your carbon dioxide\n\n03:56.440 --> 04:01.520\nbubbles. And when you stick your head above water, fly into your nose and mouth, sting you,\n\n04:01.520 --> 04:08.960\nand, and effectively kill you. Like Jason Voorhees in the deleted scene of the Derek Mears version,\n\n04:08.960 --> 04:15.000\nwhere Jason Voorhees just stands outside Crystal Lake, so that the woman who's trying to get away\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:20.520\nfrom him by swimming, just she just slowly drowns. He's walking around. Yeah, she just keeps swimming\n\n04:20.520 --> 04:26.520\neach side of Crystal Lake. And then Jason just walks around the lake and watches her drown. He's\n\n04:26.520 --> 04:33.840\nlike a one man beehive. Did they edit that out of the movie? I remember seeing that where he,\n\n04:33.840 --> 04:39.000\nwhere he, I remember Derek, Derek describing that to me. And I was like, this confirms that this\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:45.960\nFriday the 13th reboot will be not the final chapter. Because it sounds awesome. Someone,\n\n04:45.960 --> 04:52.320\nsomeone thought of that. I like that. I like, I like it when brutality isn't just a torture porn\n\n04:52.320 --> 04:56.840\nwhen it's more like, I guess it kind of is torture porn. Let's think of a new way to kill a lady.\n\n04:56.840 --> 05:02.360\nAll right. Well, I guess that franchise deserved to die. Okay. This was my, my friend could have\n\n05:02.360 --> 05:07.760\ngotten more work. Did you watch any of those Winter Olympics, Dan? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What? Which\n\n05:07.760 --> 05:17.440\nones? I like the figure skating. Yeah. Why? The spinning, the triumph of the human will. Yeah.\n\n05:25.200 --> 05:27.240\nDan's going to get a sports corner in that thing.\n\n05:27.240 --> 05:40.680\nHey, Olympics. Yeah, I figure skating. Look, I'm not going to, I know it's 2018 and Dan Harmon\n\n05:40.680 --> 05:46.640\nhasn't had a year where anyone's going to him for opinions about what's sexually titillating.\n\n05:46.640 --> 05:52.120\nI'm not a popular source of that information. It's no longer charming for me to talk about the\n\n05:52.120 --> 05:58.720\nthings that make me excited. You don't have to like what you like without crossing a line.\n\n05:58.720 --> 06:03.120\nNo, it's just not charismatic. I know I'm allowed to do all kinds of stuff. Just saying,\n\n06:03.120 --> 06:09.440\nI know, I know, I know that's not really what's for sale with me. But I, but I, but you brought\n\n06:09.440 --> 06:18.040\nit up. Look, I figure skate, female figure skating outfits are how I wish everyone dressed in\n\n06:18.040 --> 06:26.800\nnormal life. Whoa, even you? Sure, I'll do anything. Yeah, it's just, it's very 80s. It's\n\n06:26.800 --> 06:32.360\nvery like the gauzy little skirts and the just the, and obviously, you know, but it's interesting\n\n06:32.360 --> 06:39.080\nbecause I look at the outfits and the outfits are titillating, but it truly is. It clearly is\n\n06:39.080 --> 06:45.520\nalso the motion, the grace, you know, the things that are difficult that somehow are also that's,\n\n06:45.520 --> 06:51.880\nit makes the person beautiful. So you keep going back and forth. Like, I will, since you guys are\n\n06:51.880 --> 06:55.520\nsubscribers and no one else is going to hear this, I will tell you, I did try to masturbate to\n\n06:55.520 --> 07:01.560\nfigure skating this year, just to see if I could. You tried unsuccessfully or? Well, I mean, I\n\n07:01.560 --> 07:07.480\ndidn't, I didn't like stay on it. I went, I ended up going to Pornhub premium and typing figure\n\n07:07.480 --> 07:13.000\nskating. Right. Just because I was like, well, wait a minute, what if I was trying to masturbate\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:18.960\nto a women's biathlon where they ski and shoot, but the MVC keeps going to commercial. Oh, yeah.\n\n07:18.960 --> 07:26.320\nAs long as we're objectifying Olympians, like, I, I, the, the, the, it's interesting, the, the\n\n07:26.320 --> 07:31.960\ncurling, everybody's crazy about the Korean curlers and the, I mean, the guys. The US men's\n\n07:31.960 --> 07:38.000\nteam. They're fetishizing. But there's also like the Swedish curlers. I mean, look, I'm now, now\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:43.320\nI'm in territory where maybe Cody could get upset. Like, I think she can't get upset. Me talking\n\n07:43.320 --> 07:47.840\nabout outfits on figure skaters. So I don't want to, I don't want to go into the Swedish curling\n\n07:47.840 --> 07:54.560\nteam. We're talking about the men's or women's. Let's say the men. Okay. Get me out of this dog\n\n07:54.560 --> 07:59.480\nhouse. All right. Let's move on. Now, while we're talking about curling outfits, I was very excited.\n\n07:59.480 --> 08:06.120\nI was in Canada when the gold medal bout was happening between the US and was it the Swiss? I\n\n08:06.120 --> 08:12.440\nbelieve. I think it's, I think it was the Swiss. It was the Swiss. And I was so happy that the men\n\n08:12.440 --> 08:15.720\nwon because they'd never won. And Canada has never lost. There was the first Olympics where\n\n08:15.720 --> 08:23.840\nCanada didn't get a medal in curling or hockey for the men. And I was very excited. And then I was\n\n08:23.840 --> 08:30.840\ntalking to church and two of the guys had red ball caps on. One guys was the bill was rounded\n\n08:30.840 --> 08:36.200\nlike, like a ball player. The other guys was kind of flat, like kind of a MAGA, like Trumpy hats.\n\n08:36.920 --> 08:44.160\nAnd I kind of put a little bit of like, I spent, I think the hours between one and two a.m. in\n\n08:44.160 --> 08:49.560\nVancouver, Googling and searching through Twitter to see if the men's curling team were\n\n08:49.560 --> 08:57.840\nTrumpies. I don't want to ask the curling questions that everybody asks. Why is it a sport? Like,\n\n08:57.840 --> 09:02.560\nwhy, since it is a sport, why hasn't anyone gotten so good at putting the puck where it belongs\n\n09:02.560 --> 09:06.920\nthat you actually need sweepy people to guide it to its spot? Like, why wouldn't it be the best\n\n09:06.920 --> 09:11.960\nstrategy of all? You put a little spin on it. And the stone starts to curl. But the sweeping\n\n09:11.960 --> 09:16.560\nyou just can speed it up and actually give it a little kind of furrow to go into. You can give\n\n09:16.560 --> 09:22.320\nit like left or right angle. You could say all of these things about a dart in the air, like\n\n09:22.320 --> 09:26.160\nthere's it's not part of darts that a helicopter comes down and like lassoes the dart or someone\n\n09:26.160 --> 09:29.960\nblows on it. It's not part of shuffleboard that someone like oils the path in front of the\n\n09:29.960 --> 09:34.720\nshuffleboard puck. Why is why is curling not just like a person that doesn't know what a freeze or\n\n09:34.720 --> 09:40.680\na draw or a draw weight. Like I said, I'm not gonna I'd be a total hypocrite to suggest that\n\n09:40.680 --> 09:45.400\nsomething's more Olympic than something else. I don't care. If the kids are having a good time,\n\n09:45.400 --> 09:53.960\nI'm happy for them curling. It's really about the yardage. But I am I am kind of surprised. It's\n\n09:53.960 --> 09:59.400\nabout the figure skating to all about the yard. Do you think that figure skating will ever be and\n\n09:59.400 --> 10:05.560\nI almost like I'm such a pervert that about my figure skating that I I almost feel like I'm\n\n10:05.560 --> 10:11.840\nlike I'm causing trouble for myself by bringing it up. But you can't help but sit there in these\n\n10:11.840 --> 10:16.520\nchanging times and watch figure skating ago. It just seems like a bit of a throwback at this point.\n\n10:16.520 --> 10:25.040\nA throwback for which I am eternally grateful. But but I like isn't it kind of actually remarkable\n\n10:25.040 --> 10:30.040\nthat we that that no one's come in and gone put some pants on these women for God's sakes. We\n\n10:30.040 --> 10:35.520\nsee the guys can skate in pants. What do we why we keep dressing them like playboy bunnies. Well,\n\n10:35.520 --> 10:41.080\nI don't think any any sport that's like inspired a hit is up for revision. Yeah, it's worth a lot\n\n10:41.080 --> 10:45.360\nof money. And also like you don't but it's probably also it's it'll be slow to change\n\n10:45.360 --> 10:50.680\nbecause of the amount of discipline. Like no one's changed how ballet dancers carry themselves\n\n10:50.680 --> 10:56.880\nlike they're it's such an it's such a difficult honor to become a ballet dancer in you know of\n\n10:56.880 --> 11:02.360\nright that that no one along the way is like going to allow themselves to be distracted by\n\n11:02.360 --> 11:05.800\nquestions about whether they should be doing this thing that they've been doing since they've been\n\n11:05.800 --> 11:10.400\nthree years old. It is crazy. I mean I've heard that there's like something called the quad jump\n\n11:10.400 --> 11:16.560\nthat's changing up the figure skating game. Yeah, the forget her name US figure skater land\n\n11:16.560 --> 11:20.440\nof the first quad in women's like she's the only woman's figure skater that's land of the quad.\n\n11:20.440 --> 11:24.360\nSomething like that. I will say this is the year that I finally I think it's part of it's like\n\n11:24.360 --> 11:29.600\ngetting middle age like maybe my hormones have tapered enough that I really am just noticing\n\n11:29.600 --> 11:35.200\nhow beautiful how graceful you know I'm like appreciative of the actual discipline and like\n\n11:35.200 --> 11:40.320\nprobably also just like well these Olympics only happen in whatever decade what is it four years\n\n11:40.320 --> 11:45.920\nsomething like that. Well two years per summer winner but four years per event you see it. Four\n\n11:45.920 --> 11:53.920\nyear Olympia. Okay so well four years ago I was I was a real douche. Yeah but and I was probably\n\n11:53.920 --> 11:58.720\nstill just like that's hot. You hadn't even thought about how you still are but now I'm kind\n\n11:58.720 --> 12:05.120\nwell I still am but now I'm like that's hot plus because of grace. Yeah right but that is the sport\n\n12:05.120 --> 12:09.760\nlike that gracefulness like I mean you know like you said it's like ballet but like that is you\n\n12:09.760 --> 12:14.080\nknow that's that's I think what the judges are looking for and stuff so that is yeah that's what\n\n12:14.080 --> 12:20.240\nthey are mastering definitely. Yeah do you think we need to see their their legs in sheer\n\n12:23.600 --> 12:28.080\nI think they want to right that's probably in order to be able to see that they're like pulling\n\n12:28.080 --> 12:33.600\noff like twirls they want to do it like yeah I think the angles the lines I think that's that's\n\n12:33.600 --> 12:37.920\nall part of it I think but also I think there's a heritage to that where it's all about this kind of\n\n12:37.920 --> 12:42.160\nthere's a heritage there's a lot of things that were good under the microscope this year\n\n12:42.160 --> 12:49.360\nsavory uh to name a few I hate the Olympics yeah the five thousand yard witch hunt\n\n12:52.240 --> 12:59.760\nSalem Olympics but I well is that what just one more thing about it dunking I think thank you to\n\n12:59.760 --> 13:03.840\nall the figure skaters out there that are working diligently and spend their lives\n\n13:03.840 --> 13:10.560\ndisciplining but especially just the ones that don't opt for the for the flesh colored over the\n\n13:10.560 --> 13:17.520\nskate uh tight pant thing that turns your leg into an ice skate I like the speed skaters because\n\n13:17.520 --> 13:20.880\nthey get out there with giant ass knives in their feet and they're right they're riding right close\n\n13:20.880 --> 13:25.600\nto each other when they wipe out it's just knives flying around and they just go sailing into a\n\n13:25.600 --> 13:30.240\nlike into a padded wall and it's like it's it's pretty exciting I'm shocked that these people\n\n13:30.240 --> 13:35.840\ncan get the knives in their feet all of them god bless them I mean that's that's I've been on ice\n\n13:35.840 --> 13:41.040\nskates like it's fucking I can't even roller skate without like breaking my ass roller skating is\n\n13:41.040 --> 13:45.680\n10 times easier than ice skating that's how crazy ice skating is it's like you just get out there\n\n13:45.680 --> 13:52.480\nand you just I I still just like I'll just stand on my ankles like I just I don't just wait until\n\n13:52.480 --> 13:58.720\nwe figure out it's not a good idea let me do this all right well that's enough of that\n\n14:00.480 --> 14:10.160\nokay uh let's uh Dan yeah let's hit a rap beat you you visibly lost weight since I've last seen\n\n14:10.160 --> 14:18.160\nyou really he's dropped a he's dropped a belt size for real no

sticks out in your head as a moment\n\n17:18.160 --> 17:24.560\nwhen you're like Jesus Christ that's really rich about yourself that you were like someone came\n\n17:24.560 --> 17:30.000\nup to you uh and said can I have a car and you were like yeah and then as they drove away you're\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:38.960\nlike whoa that's not me I can't believe I gave that guy a car I've never given anyone a car well I mean\n\n17:39.840 --> 17:43.840\ngiven family members cars I'm trying to think of an example like so I so I can pay the way for you\n\n17:46.320 --> 17:51.040\ndon't worry about that yeah I did this Robert have you ever given anybody a free iPad and not\n\n17:51.040 --> 17:58.800\nlorded it over them yeah you have me too that's actually very interesting to hear yeah I

actually give anyone an iPad he just let him borrow it yeah but he did\n\n18:08.080 --> 18:14.480\nhe did make him feel bad about it yeah I heard this on the previous episode I uh I buy every Apple\n\n18:14.480 --> 18:21.680\nTV movie no I don't rent it I just buy it because I want to watch them on my other my other devices\n\n18:21.680 --> 18:28.320\nbut that's not normal that's a rich that's a rich guy thing sure yeah every Apple TV movie or just\n\n18:28.320 --> 18:32.720\nthe ones you like there's a couple that I'll just rent if it's like a found footage Canadian horror\n\n18:32.720 --> 18:40.000\nmovie probably like okay I'll rent this so maybe it's psychotic I'll go ahead and admit that but\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:49.120\nI will often you know buy movies on iTunes but at the same time if I catch my wife buying something\n\n18:49.120 --> 18:55.760\non iTunes like a real housewives of wherever and I know it's available on another app that\n\n18:55.760 --> 19:01.680\nwe subscribe to for free I'll be like hey come on why are you doing that we wasting that three\n\n19:01.680 --> 19:06.720\ndollars for yeah I won't like yell at her anything but I will annoy her to a point where yeah she\n\n19:06.720 --> 19:11.600\ngets mad at me you're not being miserly that's uh that's a that's a redditor thing that's your\n\n19:11.600 --> 19:16.720\nass be brain like it's a logic addiction you're like you can't check hulu you can't check hulu\n\n19:16.720 --> 19:22.560\nbefore you buy this thing on don't fall for the apple trap yeah our demographic has the highest\n\n19:22.560 --> 19:29.200\nratio of uh wait I don't know how to phrase it it's the the highest ratio of disposable income to\n\n19:29.200 --> 19:36.800\ntotal unacceptance of like throwing money away like it's like like I've never seen people that are\n\n19:36.800 --> 19:42.400\nprobably pretty rich uh talk so meticulously about what they're getting for three dollars here\n\n19:42.400 --> 19:47.120\ntwo dollars there like it's not it's not even cheapness it is it's like because they'll give\n\n19:47.120 --> 19:51.280\nfifty dollars to the Red Cross if they see a hurricane like they're good people that they're\n\n19:51.280 --> 19:57.440\nnot miserly but if they're addicted to uh logic they don't want to be a sucker exactly yeah and I\n\n19:57.440 --> 20:03.280\ndid the math one time I was you know I was like well if she bought one or two a week for an entire\n\n20:03.280 --> 20:08.880\nyear we're looking at like a hundred dollars all right quit making your wife mad at you but yeah\n\n20:08.880 --> 20:14.000\nI still I still do it sometimes anytime I do the math I'm like man none of this matters anytime I do\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:18.560\nthe math it's like this doesn't add up to I shouldn't have even done the math let me ask\n\n20:18.560 --> 20:25.200\nsome walking dead questions that I've been afraid to ask oh like what happens after they leave the\n\n20:25.200 --> 20:33.440\nprison I've been afraid to ask that because it makes me a bad friend almost every question\n\n20:34.160 --> 20:37.840\nthat you could ask like that they find another well is they some of them die\n\n20:41.040 --> 20:44.880\nI see there's a guy with a bat that has barbed wire on the bat now that he looks like he's\n\n20:44.880 --> 20:48.160\ngonna be a problem you don't watch the show I haven't watched it since they left the prison it's\n\n20:48.160 --> 20:52.160\nnot because I know that's fine that in fact was the high point you can ask you know we don't need\n\n20:52.160 --> 20:58.240\nyou I don't I know you don't and I but ask ask Gimple Scott Gimple I I went to dinner with him\n\n20:58.240 --> 21:03.440\nand I was like holy it was right after the prison you know what happened when they left the prison\n\n21:03.440 --> 21:07.760\nthat's when Scott Gimple took over a showrunner so your buddy you haven't watched any of his\n\n21:07.760 --> 21:12.400\nepisodes at all yeah I was it yeah I guess maybe he accepted the praise and he shouldn't have but\n\n21:12.400 --> 21:18.880\nyeah I was like man you guys are nailing it yeah and I and then I and then you just I don't know\n\n21:18.880 --> 21:23.920\nmaybe I look I haven't watched it let me do a run through so they leave the prison and then\n\n21:23.920 --> 21:30.640\nthey go to this place called Terminus and then I'm not gonna recap Robert no offense I don't\n\n21:30.640 --> 21:35.280\nwatch a lot of TV shows I've never seen one second of walking dead even how many seasons has this\n\n21:35.280 --> 21:40.960\nbeen on for we we're just starting the back half of season eight Jesus Christ but also that's it's\n\n21:40.960 --> 21:45.360\nalmost more walking dead than anyone can add that's a strong eight because there's also like three\n\n21:45.360 --> 21:50.640\nshows coming off of it there's a there's a cooking dead walking there's a there's a there's a cooking\n\n21:50.640 --> 22:01.120\ndead chopped junior for just kids who make food who are zombies um Chris Hardwick like like sits\n\n22:01.120 --> 22:06.480\nin a bathtub and talks about walking dead in two different shows and then there's an actual other\n\n22:06.480 --> 22:12.080\nwalking dead show there's a scripting dead where they just show pages from the script and they just\n\n22:12.080 --> 22:19.360\nslowly turn that could be huge how how how has how is fear of the walking dead uh there's no of\n\n22:19.360 --> 22:25.440\nright oh fear fear okay that would be yeah and even I know that fear of the walking dead that\n\n22:25.440 --> 22:29.680\nthat does start automatically like a worse show because it's like it could just be people in a\n\n22:29.680 --> 22:38.160\nroom I ain't going outside I'm not going outside like I hear there's zombies out there there might be I have fear of the walking dead I'm staying indoors\n\n22:39.200 --> 22:46.400\nhow how has that been uh critically creatively financially run through the metrics check check and\n\n22:46.400 --> 22:50.800\ncheck I don't know it's all been fine it's still on everybody's happy with it yeah yeah we just started\n\n22:50.800 --> 22:55.440\nour well we're working on a fourth season it'll start right after season eight we got uh Andrew\n\n22:55.440 --> 23:00.800\nChambliss and uh Ian Goldberg taking over his showrunners this season uh we got this character\n\n23:00.800 --> 23:05.360\nMorgan from walking dead that's going to be jumping over a few of the walking dead so there's some crazy\n\n23:05.360 --> 23:10.720\nstuff jump over yeah yeah it's going to be it's going to be a cool new season oh I hope Morgan\n\n23:10.720 --> 23:15.840\ndoesn't judge them for being such scary cats I think he will he's kind of a jerk that Morgan he's\n\n23:15.840 --> 23:19.680\ngoing to be like guys come outside it's fine I've been up to my ears in these things and you're you\n\n23:19.680 --> 23:25.360\nhave a show about being scared of them what is this it's like it's like when uh it's like when\n\n23:25.360 --> 23:31.360\nJerry Orbach went over to uh uh the trial by jury law and order it's like a kind of retirement it's\n\n23:31.360 --> 23:35.840\na golden parachute for this Morgan character yeah yeah pretty much he's gonna go chill out and be\n\n23:35.840 --> 23:39.680\nscared of the walking dead yeah we gotta we gotta establish that we're moving him from walking dead\n\n23:39.680 --> 23:43.120\nshow to walking dead show so that when we put up a new show it's like okay and now Morgan's going\n\n23:43.120 --> 23:48.320\nto this one too how many walking deads are there like I mean how many zombies like how many of\n\n23:48.320 --> 23:55.520\nthe walking dead like population wise I don't I don't keep those numbers I mean just like ball\n\n23:55.520 --> 24:01.200\npark it for me I don't know like a billion billion who knows so like he's gonna get in a lot of\n\n24:01.200 --> 24:06.160\ntrouble just for riffing that number it's gonna be like a 90 I'm gonna get somebody's like wait a\n\n24:06.160 --> 24:10.560\nminute hold on a billion it can't be a billion yeah clearly not shown this much it's not gonna no\n\n24:10.560 --> 24:15.280\nregion wouldn't have that's gonna be worse any new season that comes out they're gonna be like\n\n24:15.280 --> 24:21.680\nbased on the billion zombies that we know are on this planet this can't possibly be the amount of\n\n24:21.680 --> 24:27.200\nzombies that are in this Walmart or like whatever they're gonna be billion zombie benchmark of 2018\n\n24:27.200 --> 24:31.760\non Harmontown well someone did the math I can't remember exactly how it broke down but\n\n24:32.720 --> 24:38.080\nit was like if 10 percent of the population remained human and they each killed like five\n\n24:38.080 --> 24:44.160\nzombies a week and every other living person was turned into a zombie they would kill all the\n\n24:44.160 --> 24:49.920\nzombies in like 11 months it's like some kind of some kind of crazy are the walking dead fans\n\n24:51.360 --> 24:54.800\nthis is such a dumb question but maybe it'll start a conversation\n\n24:56.000 --> 25:02.080\nlet's hope because it seems like it's got what are walking dead fans compared to other fandoms\n\n25:02.080 --> 25:10.000\nyou've seen are they are they more or less obsessed with stuff like that or are they more like chill\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:15.360\nlike it's not about the science or are they just this different shades I mean there are\n\n25:16.080 --> 25:20.400\nyou know I get I get those essays right you know you clearly meant this was going to happen\n\n25:20.400 --> 25:25.360\nthat's why it was a dumb question this and yeah but I mean there's you know there's there's there's\n\n25:25.360 --> 25:30.400\nchill fans and there's really crazy fans which I think are awesome I mean anytime I get a\n\n25:31.120 --> 25:37.600\ngoddamn like 30 page book report on like a two minute scene I'm like man it's the best thing\n\n25:37.600 --> 25:42.080\nI've ever seen I'll read them I'll read the whole thing I'm like this is insane I won't read them\n\n25:42.080 --> 25:49.360\nbut I'm like cha-ching sounds like I still got it I'm still immersing them I still it's like\n\n25:49.920 --> 25:55.120\nit's like if you ran a casino when you see somebody on the sidewalk crying you're like\n\n25:55.120 --> 26:03.440\nfuck I still got it so Dan you didn't read my 20 page essay on community uh no no I mean I thought\n\n26:03.440 --> 26:10.240\nI was offended by the title I thought it was uh you know we all we all missed Donald you don't\n\n26:10.240 --> 26:19.200\nhave to uh if I can dig into the show when it's at its weak point um the uh but uh are you okay\n\n26:19.200 --> 26:23.520\nshifting gears ever so slightly though you got you just also finished you're just telling me\n\n26:23.520 --> 26:31.840\nright before we came on 15 years of Invincible yes your other comic book yeah yeah the last\n\n26:31.840 --> 26:38.240\nissue came out uh last week I think did it did did he become invincible yeah he died no no\n\n26:39.120 --> 26:43.440\nthey lived happily ever after it was pretty lame but uh because if you only lived for 15 years\n\n26:43.440 --> 26:47.680\nthat's not even Invincible that's like I can do that I did it three times already\n\n26:50.080 --> 26:54.480\nfair point fair point no he did not die at the end of the book spoiler alert is it easier\n\n26:54.480 --> 27:00.800\nhard to end uh end a 15 year long comic book series uh it was pretty I don't know it was\n\n27:00.800 --> 27:05.840\ndifficult in that uh I mean when I was writing the last issue I kept coming up with more ideas\n\n27:05.840 --> 27:11.280\nfor the next issue oh yeah stop brain this is not what we're doing right what are you doing uh\n\n27:11.280 --> 27:15.280\nand then it just made

you\n\n27:20.640 --> 27:26.000\ndidn't have to do it anymore or anything you could have run in the street naked and said I'm\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:31.360\nRobert Kirkman arrest me and no one would be allowed to me because of the money yeah yeah uh\n\n27:31.360 --> 27:35.280\nyeah I don't know I try to ignore that kind of stuff also you know if you sit down and do the math\n\n27:35.280 --> 27:42.400\nit's like all right I'm gonna be broke by like 62 I'm hoping to live longer than 62 come on you have\n\n27:42.400 --> 27:49.760\nyou have drew carry money by now as in like you have so much

you for you obviously both in terms of\n\n32:55.600 --> 33:00.640\nyour longevity and the quality of your output and your continued and the and the healthy glow in your\n\n33:00.640 --> 33:08.880\neyes um like and your lustrous coat um you you clearly are a person who my therapist would\n\n33:08.880 --> 33:17.440\nwould say to me see Dan he doesn't turn what he loves into a nightmare so that he can be more\n\n33:17.440 --> 33:22.960\ncomfortable doing it like he doesn't have a fucked up relationship with what he loves that's all\n\n33:22.960 --> 33:26.880\nlike that's that's all you got going on so you don't need a hobby good for you what do you do\n\n33:26.880 --> 33:31.600\nfuck off well now you make me now I feel terrible the hell Robert you don't have a you don't have a\n\n33:31.600 --> 33:35.920\nhobby like a little side thing you do like model airplanes or you like to do like uh you're like\n\n33:35.920 --> 33:42.880\na pet groomer or nothing you just draw on right pretty much yeah yeah I mean I've got the two\n\n33:42.880 --> 33:49.600\nkids so uh that takes up all the non-working time so yeah so yeah so you're spending time with my\n\n33:49.600 --> 33:53.840\nkids is that a hobby does that count no that's kind of a hobby that makes drawing and writing a hobby\n\n33:53.840 --> 33:59.200\nprobably but but for you a lucrative one that lets you have yeah it is definitely the old cliche of\n\n34:00.160 --> 34:06.560\nman I can't wait for those vacations over so I can get back to work yeah yeah god fuck you\n\n34:06.560 --> 34:14.880\nno that is good I mean and and and and everybody that I say like I want to retire you know they go\n\n34:14.880 --> 34:20.560\nlike you're never gonna retire end in a fist fight yeah yeah the world's slowest saddest\n\n34:21.600 --> 34:29.280\nleast necessary fist fight which is both like no one got hurt it just they fought for a long time\n\n34:29.280 --> 34:34.800\nand no one got hurt it descends into a shoulder rub that's not even that good I was I was I was in\n\n34:34.800 --> 34:40.080\na Laguna beach bar fight and that's exactly what it was I Cody was so impressed he's like I can't\n\n34:40.080 --> 34:45.280\nbelieve you got up and intervened I'm like no one it was that's like jury duty there's a there was a\n\n34:45.280 --> 34:50.880\nan old guy and then like this like middle-aged guy like I couldn't tell which one voted for Trump\n\n34:50.880 --> 34:56.240\nI had no idea obviously someone did or this wouldn't be happening they were like yelling they started\n\n34:56.240 --> 35:01.520\nyelling at each other and then and then at one point they both stood up and they're like me and\n\n35:01.520 --> 35:08.080\nthe other two dudes in the bar both like like rolling our eyes like got up off the bar still was\n\n35:08.080 --> 35:13.680\nlike really slowly and shuffled over there to break up two guys who were never actually going\n\n35:13.680 --> 35:21.280\nto fight because they're both so old it was a Laguna beach bar fight and the funny thing is\n\n35:21.280 --> 35:25.360\nlike Cody was like she's like wait I can't tell which one was the good guy which one was the bad\n\n35:25.360 --> 35:30.400\nguy so she was trying to like eavesdrop on the loudmouth guy to see was he a loudmouth liberal\n\n35:30.400 --> 35:36.640\nthat pissed off the old coot conservative or is that an old hippie who whose side we're on and\n\n35:36.640 --> 35:42.880\nis he like some kind of like flashy like loud drunk like a right-wing guy who's feeling his\n\n35:42.880 --> 35:49.120\noats we couldn't and and and she kept she kept trying to be able to tell from the things she was\n\n35:49.120 --> 35:55.440\noverhearing him say what which one he was and it was kind of like it's Pat sketch because\n\n35:55.440 --> 36:01.920\nyou can say things like well now you sound like a libertarian and we still don't know what you are\n\n36:02.960 --> 36:10.000\nyou're just equally outraged anyways at that it's it was funny at the time but it's it's really\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:19.840\nnot the best use of your time what else happened let me ask you next oh uh there's another walking\n\n36:19.840 --> 36:31.280\ndead question when it first came on uh fx i were they were advertising it i'm like i'm so excited\n\n36:31.280 --> 36:42.000\nmc uh really i want i want i've seen him watch it like he has watched american movie classics that\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:47.520\ndoesn't make any sense i i agree i've seen him read the comic they don't make television shows\n\n36:47.520 --> 36:53.200\nwhat other television show have they i know okay the uh never seen the classic movie the walking\n\n36:53.200 --> 37:02.160\ndead tv show when i saw the the um when i saw the ads coming i think like an idiot i was like oh i'm\n\n37:02.160 --> 37:09.280\nso excited i'm gonna catch up on the i'm gonna reread the the trade paperbacks that i have\n\n37:10.160 --> 37:16.800\nwhich it was a dumb move because the first like season was a pretty faithful like rigorously\n\n37:16.800 --> 37:20.960\nfaithful adaptation to the point where i was like so you're reading the comic you were bored\n\n37:20.960 --> 37:25.200\ni was like i was like well no i was like well i was reading the comics in advance of watching the\n\n37:25.200 --> 37:30.640\nshow like because i was like watching the tv show i was like well i already know that guy's racist\n\n37:30.640 --> 37:37.040\ni read that that's all then i got excited when it started deviating i was like oh they're gonna\n\n37:37.040 --> 37:41.520\ndeviate was there a big conversation about that and what side were you on and how did that go\n\n37:41.520 --> 37:45.760\nno i mean it's i mean it's it's a weird it's a whole it's a weird process because i'm in the\n\n37:45.760 --> 37:52.880\nwriter's room a lot more on the earlier seasons and uh you know they're talking about like well\n\n37:52.880 --> 37:56.720\nwe can't do this because that's that didn't really work oh oh sorry robert i mean you know it worked\n\n37:56.720 --> 38:02.480\nfine but you know the you know so it's like a little awkward sometimes but uh but i mean i really\n\n38:02.480 --> 38:07.520\nenjoyed it and and it's uh it's very humbling to be in a room of writers that are picking apart\n\n38:07.520 --> 38:12.400\nyou know the thing that you wrote and and trying to turn into a tv show i think the only way i was\n\n38:12.400 --> 38:17.840\nable to keep my sanity is because uh you know i started walking up when i was 23 and then you\n\n38:17.840 --> 38:22.800\nknow i'm like 28 or so when the show started and so it was stuff that was like five years of my\n\n38:22.800 --> 38:26.560\nrear view and so i could be like yeah look that didn't work i wasn't you were you were at yeah\n\n38:26.560 --> 38:32.000\nthat probably kept you from punching them in the face that's just the self-loathing sure right yeah\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:38.640\nbut uh but then and i was always the one that would push to change things because uh i don't\n\n38:38.640 --> 38:45.280\nknow if i'm an asshole or or what but i i i mean i i love being surprised and it's one of the things\n\n38:45.280 --> 38:49.600\ni i enjoy most out of my entertainment like when i don't see something coming it's that's when i'm\n\n38:49.600 --> 38:56.240\nlike oh that's the best stuff i wish i had paid an actor to be dressed as a zombie i'm like come\n\n38:56.240 --> 39:01.840\nlumbering out here right now behind you just to scare me yeah i ain't scared of zombies but uh it\n\n39:01.840 --> 39:06.160\nwouldn't surprise you it probably happens all the time on these panels we could have had rob come\n\n39:06.160 --> 39:12.960\nout there and do a zombie bit yeah coming yeah instead of doing this rob what's going on like\n\n39:12.960 --> 39:19.520\nyou you're you're uh let's bring rob on well you let's bring rob's rob on but so

there's a little hose that shoots water up your butt yeah it's more of a nozzle\n\n41:57.680 --> 42:01.760\nit's a nozzle it's like an upside down spray bottle how do you work on the aim of those things i mean\n\n42:01.760 --> 42:07.440\ni was at a hotel i imagine you can adjust but you gotta rock it back and forth you gotta get like\n\n42:07.440 --> 42:12.720\noh you move during it that's interesting because i was doing wrong you don't have to but i do\n\n42:12.720 --> 42:20.000\nyou're a master i was in india recently and a lot of bidets a lot of bidets but not as we stayed\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:26.000\nin very like um you know because it was an english colony for so long very very westernized hotels\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:29.520\nso there were no bidets in hotels we stayed at but a couple of the places we went to\n\n42:30.160 --> 42:36.240\nlike nice restaurants in nice areas in the men's room i'm assuming the women's room too\n\n42:36.240 --> 42:40.720\nthere was just a hose like a garden hose with it's like a nozzle a squeeze nozzle yeah and it's just\n\n42:40.720 --> 42:45.520\nlaying on the floor next to the toilet and like that's and there's no paper that's not clean there's\n\n42:45.520 --> 42:50.240\nno paper at all so you're supposed to get up and just hose off your butt and then you got a wet\n\n42:50.240 --> 42:56.080\nbutt and you pull your pants up i i i would you or do you just drip dry like there's people outside\n\n42:56.080 --> 42:58.880\nwaiting to hose it off there but you just bring you just bring naan into the bathroom with you\n\n42:58.880 --> 43:05.280\nyou're pretty so you see now that's i see i i i i bring some pop it down is that not okay i bring\n\n43:05.280 --> 43:11.520\nthe pop it down because it's a little lighter and flakier that must that must be they must be\n\n43:11.520 --> 43:17.760\nthat must be some good indian food if they got like hoses for your butt yeah yeah it's food so\n\n43:17.760 --> 43:25.120\nspicy you're going to want to hose your asshole yeah but given the choice between a rule of toilet\n\n43:25.120 --> 43:31.440\npaper and it but you can't have both given a choice you choose water i'm talking about restrooms at\n\n43:31.440 --> 43:38.000\nnice restaurants that had no paper at all anywhere and like you couldn't even go and get a paper tell\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:42.640\nthem bring it into the thing with you you had a hose on the ground right that presumably everybody\n\n43:42.640 --> 43:47.760\nthat's ever taken a poop there has recently used well and you gotta you don't stick it up your butt\n\n43:47.760 --> 43:54.160\nyou stand up and you rinse your asshole off but like it looks it looks it looked dry so people\n\n43:54.160 --> 43:57.840\nknow how to do that without spraying down the whole building well because they know they probably\n\n43:57.840 --> 44:02.800\nthey haven't had a toilet paper culture for like from rich to poor like they just don't use toilet\n\n44:02.800 --> 44:10.400\npaper yeah but then you i somebody help me out go into a hole into the toilet bowl have you seen\n\n44:10.400 --> 44:19.040\nslump dog millionaire it goes to india yeah but but like it didn't look wet and people had been\n\n44:19.040 --> 44:23.920\npooping in there i i mean obviously they know how to do it delicately but then i my main thing is\n\n44:23.920 --> 44:30.800\nnow you got a wet butt and a wet crotch and then you just pull up your wet poopy drawers and go\n\n44:30.800 --> 44:34.240\nbut they're not poopy they just go back to have desserts ostensibly they're just wet come on\n\n44:34.240 --> 44:39.680\nwe've all taken a big giant shit and then gotten right in the shower right at least once god yeah\n\n44:39.680 --> 44:45.120\nyou have to just for the thrill of it you just go like you know what not wiping yeah gotta gotta\n\n44:45.120 --> 44:52.160\ntake a shower anyway no no no i've never done that then i haven't either no you

45:36.720\nif we don't go to the creepy creepy place it's just a dumb reaction to have it's a standard biological\n\n45:36.720 --> 45:42.800\namount of diversity yeah two kids one's a boy one's a girl oh i'm gonna give you the old seven\n\n45:42.800 --> 45:48.800\nten split a i'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt that that to me that was you making a sound\n\n45:48.800 --> 45:53.760\nto cover the fact that you could not care less about my children and you regretted asking that\n\n45:53.760 --> 45:58.800\nquestion no i didn't i didn't ask about kids i don't care about kids you're half right it was it was\n\n45:58.800 --> 46:06.320\na it was a standard uh bad interviewer nervous tick like i need to have a reaction with uh but\n\n46:06.320 --> 46:10.560\ni didn't regret asking it because i'd love to talk to a genius about having kids because\n\n46:10.560 --> 46:14.880\ni it's uh i'm not to put you on the spot but i'm sure you're gonna say things that no one's ever\n\n46:14.880 --> 46:24.240\nsaid let's hear it how old are you when you had your first child uh oh uh 27 oh that's respectable\n\n46:24.240 --> 46:30.080\nedge yeah it's a solid third baseline and and and my wife hates it when i talk about it but you\n\n46:30.080 --> 46:37.600\nknow i'm from kentucky and um you know everybody has kids when they're like 21 22 23 so we were\n\n46:37.600 --> 46:44.240\nwe were we were late late in the game at 27 yeah yeah yeah us to wisconsin same thing i mean it's\n\n46:44.240 --> 46:52.720\nkind of like you not you know basically like the two cities that dinosaurs and uh king kong don't\n\n46:52.720 --> 46:57.680\nattack in the movies wait or do attack those are the only exceptions everywhere else i think people\n\n46:57.680 --> 47:03.600\nget married pretty pretty quickly after high school yeah you know it's the king kong and the\n\n47:03.600 --> 47:11.440\ngodzilla factor that really um now that's not keeps uh why do you keep having him on yeah\n\n47:12.160 --> 47:17.760\nyeah thank you i keep asking the same thing the whole time i keep thinking he'll bring my ipad back\n\n47:17.760 --> 47:23.040\ni think i keep getting texts from levy like oh are you coming are you bringing are you coming\n\n47:23.040 --> 47:28.240\nrob can i are you still starting are you gonna you're gonna be here you're gonna be here you're\n\n47:28.240 --> 47:34.240\nstill starting are you on your way are you still coming right it's because we're worried about you\n\n47:34.240 --> 47:38.800\nwe had to we had to have Schrab on for uh the third installment do you think that psychologically\n\n47:38.800 --> 47:42.720\nthe reason i'm 44 and haven't had children is because i grew up in a place that's so likely\n\n47:42.720 --> 47:48.000\nto get king kong or godzilla or meteor attacked because i know it's bleak yeah well why have a\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:53.040\nchild if you know that any moment you're gonna get armageddon godzilla yeah timie lee jones is\n\n47:53.040 --> 47:57.040\ngoing to be on your doorstep screaming about something new york and los angeles more so\n\n47:57.040 --> 48:01.840\nlos angeles than new york geostorm because new york has people that lift things and fish for\n\n48:01.840 --> 48:06.400\nthings but you know like these two big cities people go to them because they're like still\n\n48:06.400 --> 48:12.160\nnot given up on their fucking like i'm gonna i'm still a baby i'm gonna i'm gonna have a big\n\n48:12.160 --> 48:16.400\npacifier in my mouth it's gonna be made a solid gold and sometimes i can take till you're 45\n\n48:17.360 --> 48:24.240\nit's interesting to be twice the age of the average Rick and Morty viewer and to be like\n\n48:24.240 --> 48:30.240\noh this person would be my kid if i had kids when my

all happy cliff hangers yeah it's all good news\n\n01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:02.720\nbecause there's you know it was like 175 so we've done 174 issues where all the cliff hangers are\n\n01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.320\nall just misery right you know like this guy's getting his hand cut off and then you're like this\n\n01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:11.040\nguy's mom finally ended one where someone's shaking a gift box and it sounds like a puppy but it could\n\n01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:16.720\nbe a kitten and then it's a puppy and they're like hey and so i was convinced that people would be\n\n01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:21.280\npissed off and so when when we revealed that the daughter is actually alive she works at a bakery\n\n01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:26.160\nand she comes out holding a cake and she sees her mother who she's thought was dead for the last\n\n01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:32.320\nmany many years live in the zombie apocalypse and she drops the cake that she's holding right so uh\n\n01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:38.080\nso i was like if people really hate this they'll say that instead of the comic jumping the shark in\n\n01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:42.160\nthis issue they'll be like this is the issue where they drop the cake right and i was trying to i was\n\n01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:49.280\ntrying to create my own like right like nuking the fridge you know but i give people a happy cliff\n\n01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:54.320\nhanger is a hopeful cliffhanger that's that it's a it's a you can still have a cliffhanger but\n\n01:18:54.320 --> 01:19:01.280\nit can be hinged on hope it's kind of an interesting concept because correct me if i'm wrong but a\n\n01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:07.040\nhopeful cliffhanger actually is you're still laying uh it's just a question of whether you're\n\n01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:14.720\nsaying oh shit something horrible right did happen we'll see you next week or saying oh\n\n01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:21.600\nshit i just found out my daughter is alive but i haven't talked to her yet tune in yeah and well\n\n01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:27.920\nand hopefully after you know 15 years of the walking dead when i present a character like\n\n01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:32.640\nmachone with a living daughter the audience is going oh man is she gonna die soon like is this\n\n01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:37.040\ngonna get taken away is this gonna get ugly quickly like you know hopefully people are\n\n01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:46.080\nhaving those worries we'll see maybe they're the walking dead the readers the viewers you\n\n01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:51.440\ndon't even like tv just say it

like we like what's the idea that we can't get to what the hell it frustrates\n\n01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:03.120\nthe thing that frustrates me is uh and i swear to god it what it was for altruistic reasons\n\n01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:08.560\nbecause it was like more like well i weep for our children kind of thing it was frustrating to me for\n\n01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:18.080\na while now i'm jaded but it was frustrating to me for a while when 20 mid kids in their mid 20s\n\n01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:28.480\notherwise known as grown ass humans um uh like who clearly like have successfully been conned by\n\n01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:36.800\nthe society that i grandfathered into like into thinking that television is like a\n\n01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:42.720\na water or gas company or something that's it because they simply have a problem with the\n\n01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:47.040\ntemperature of it coming out of their tap which means they're never going to create anything\n\n01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:53.040\nand i know that i'm not as amazing as i am i know that the fact that i ended up in hollywood\n\n01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:58.400\nmaking my own shit had must have had something to do with the fact that some point along the\n\n01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:04.640\nline somebody told me in some way that resonated with me you know you could do it too you could\n\n01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:10.160\njust do it and i feel like when i read i used to feel sad when i would read certain shit like\n\n01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:16.320\nwhere i'd be like wow you think tv is toothpaste and you don't know that your parents buy your\n\n01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:26.800\ntoothpaste like you think that you're just mad at 25 that the tv came out wrong and you're not even\n\n01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:35.440\nashamed that you're saying like horrible shit to someone that you that is designed semantically\n\n01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:42.160\nto provoke their suicide over the fact that something wasn't written by you because you\n\n01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:46.640\ndon't know you could write yeah and that used to make me sad but then i turned 45 and i was like\n\n01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:54.080\ncha-ching enslaved population like then they voted for trump and then i was like stay dumb\n\n01:23:54.080 --> 01:24:00.080\nfucking let me give me five years stay this stupid let me out of here i don't agree with\n\n01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:06.480\nany of your social security checks while you're at it's braver than me i commend that i yeah but\n\n01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:15.920\ni went when i was 30 when i was your age uh when my kid was only 11 uh i uh i i i would i would be\n\n01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:22.640\nlike this is such a bummer man like like like it's not that i'm smarter than kids that it's like\n\n01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.720\nit's it's just like i had a school paper they don't have a school paper if they had a school\n\n01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.360\npaper they wouldn't be saying this shit or they would have been saying it in the school paper\n\n01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:34.560\nand you never would have seen it and they would have said it in school paper and it would have\n\n01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:39.120\nactivated them and they would have become a tv writer but instead they like go to like english\n\n01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:43.680\nclass and english classes here's how you pass your sat's maybe unless you're going into the funnel\n\n01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:48.320\nthat will take you to mcdonald's here you go oh you're gonna say um by the way enjoy watching\n\n01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:52.640\ntelevision which is created by a mysterious race of people in california that would no one has any\n\n01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:57.040\nidea how they got out there but we don't know they're all liberal cucktards that just uh are\n\n01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:01.360\nungrateful and it's like and it's like no one at any point says to these kids in the hallway by\n\n01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:07.200\ntheir locker by the way you could you could just move out there so you think you think that that\n\n01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:14.000\nthere's a there's a lack of awareness in the general population that they could be a writer there's\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:20.960\na lack of of creative arts education there's there was a genuine in general 20 year pullback\n\n01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:29.040\non in our educational institutions particularly the public ones of on one side um uh what do you\n\n01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:35.360\ncall it um because i don't fraternize with blue collar people but um the work programs the trades\n\n01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:40.880\nthe trades like the internships where you could be if you were gonna be a mechanic and you were\n\n01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:45.200\ngood at it high school wouldn't tell you you were a worthless piece of shit and you should go to rehab\n\n01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:50.640\nthey would tell you you could be a mechanic and like place you in a fucking mechanic job or and\n\n01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:56.240\nthen on the other hand also you if you're if you're gonna go to college but possibly maybe don't\n\n01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:00.400\nknow exactly what you're supposed to do that like oh there's a thing called poetry there's a thing\n\n01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:06.720\ncalled fucking like

the dead which is classic great um very\n\n01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:28.480\nexcited about that it had been far too long wait the uh the classic or the remake the oh the classic\n\n01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:33.520\ni i did did you i had seen the room i've been obsessive about the day of the dead i was like i\n\n01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:38.480\nwould tell people like that's that's the best like the Romero trilogy it's so great that it builds\n\n01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:44.480\nfrom work a day schmucks in a black and white house going like what the fuck's happening\n\n01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:51.200\nto the next tier of civilization which is these slightly more privileged cops and and reporters\n\n01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:55.760\nlike holing up in a shopping mall and then that the culmination is this like oh my god this isn't\n\n01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:02.400\neven life anymore it's scientists and soldiers they're literally buried but the but the only\n\n01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:06.720\nthing i noticed because i kept telling dakotio is like you gotta see like like first i gotta i gotta\n\n01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:11.280\nshow you these first two movies and then i i kept telling her like yeah the day of the dead and\n\n01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:15.680\nit's like it's the best it's like in a bunker and it's like crazy and then i watched it again i felt\n\n01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:22.160\na little embarrassed in the eyes of the person i was trying to indoctrinate because i was like oh\n\n01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:28.160\ni forgot there's no zombies in this one like day of the dead it's not it's they come in at the end\n\n01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:32.640\nand plenty all right well it's got the good it's good i can't tell if you're high-roading me or\n\n01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:36.720\nmedium-roading me you're helping me you're trying to help me out yeah no but you shouldn't have felt\n\n01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.800\nbad my the most fascinating thing about day of the dead if you guys don't know this is that uh that\n\n01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:45.840\nwasn't the movie that georgia merrow originally wanted to make he there's a different script\n\n01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:50.720\nthat you can find online for the original day of the dead that was like this massive movie that\n\n01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:56.560\nhad different people live on an island and well he eventually did that right the he never did that\n\n01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:00.560\nmovie he did another movie that took place on where they're the sky rise and the zombies learned to\n\n01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:04.320\nland of the dead yeah yeah yeah there was some material i think from that that ended up at land\n\n01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:09.520\nof the dead i think the dead reckoning was in oh was the i thought i thought i'd yeah i thought that\n\n01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:14.000\nit's been a while since i've read it wasn't wasn't didn't romero like say like there were certain\n\n01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.800\nzombies that they were actually being used as weapons like they were had different colorings on\n\n01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:22.960\nthem or do you know yeah like certain zombie i think they were trained to do different things\n\n01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:28.240\nthere's a lot more bubs in the original right right right yeah yeah i mean i think i think like\n\n01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:34.720\nromero's obsession was with the idea that there was an evolution happening yeah like which i would\n\n01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:41.680\nsay like you know like but i'm not i'm not i'm not my favorite aspect it's it's it's like i don't\n\n01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:46.480\nneed that it's sort of like the wakowski siblings like being in just parts of the matrix trilogy\n\n01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:51.280\nthat you're like oh you look you've earned the right to be obsessive about this but you know when\n\n01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:56.400\ncolonel sander starts you know him and hawn on stuff i can't understand well i can someone just\n\n01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:01.680\nwear sunglasses yeah somebody i'm not smart enough for this i think that i think that comes from the\n\n01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:08.240\nfact that like night living dad was originally like conceived by russo and and dred romero as\n\n01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:14.800\na sequel to omega man like the idea was supposed to be let's let's do because we liked last man on\n\n01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:20.160\nearth the the vincent price one and if you watch last man on earth at night living dad they feel\n\n01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:24.320\nlike like one's a prequel but like at the last minute well not at the last month they said well\n\n01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:30.320\nwe can't do that let's let's choose a different it can't be vampires let's make them zombies and\n\n01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:38.400\nthey'll eat people instead of doing uh uh drinking blood but in the omega man like the the the the\n\n01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:45.120\nvampires were slowly taking over the the world and becoming the dominant species so that's kind of\n\n01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:49.440\nlike what i think he was doing with the zombies the zombies were taking over and they were coming\n\n01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:54.320\ntheir own dominant species and the humans were going to be in a sense it's also then a prequel\n\n01:32:54.320 --> 01:33:04.720\nto uh daybreakers with steven dwarf all right wasn't that with uh it was about the girls that with\n\n01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:10.960\nthe ski masks and the spring break that go down and it's rob places you know james franco that's\n\n01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:16.480\nspring breakers not daybreakers is vampires have taken over and they have like a it's a it's a future\n\n01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:23.040\nvampire society where vampires are the dominant species and humans are it's a very Schrabby thing\n\n01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:30.080\nlike i'm pretty sure you probably have seen it yeah um ski patrol it's not ski patrol i've named\n\n01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:36.880\nthe movie three times now have you seen daybreakers wedding crashers god damn it all of you daybreakers\n\n01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:41.280\nit's eating hot drinks drink your drink drink your drink damn vampires are people you know but\n\n01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:46.480\ni've actually seen them but have you had i don't want to get into your politics a bit but like you're\n\n01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:51.280\nlike you know it's like like when you watch day of the dead i left my making america green again\n\n01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:56.720\nhad at home but go ahead and they've got that like you know that plotting synth score and then\n\n01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:03.200\nshe's got to go to her meeting with the soldiers it's like isn't that the dread that that scene\n\n01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:07.360\nand it's early in the movie it's like basically it's the call to adventure because there's nothing\n\n01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:11.920\nleft anymore and it's just the there let's have a meeting and the soldiers are like i want to know\n\n01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:17.280\nwhat the fuck is going on and i've got the fucking guns and what the fuck are you eggheads doing and\n\n01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:23.360\nyou know and it's like you're just in a lab coat it's so you it's like it's the liberal nightmare\n\n01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:31.200\nis like i like oh yeah okay the world's gotten so shitty that you control it and you're a horrible\n\n01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:37.200\nperson and i have no idea what you're gonna do i only know what the zombies are gonna do and we've\n\n01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:43.360\ngotten pretty good at controlling them and we'd like that comfort to continue it's a very resonant\n\n01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:50.000\nfor today moment that that conversation because it's like no good guys or bad guys because if you\n\n01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:57.200\nstrain the dumb part of your brain you can relate to the soldiers too they're like give us some results\n\n01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:02.480\nwe have a bunch of assault rifles should we not be like maybe going and finding a new bunker\n\n01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:10.320\nwhen when she goes down when they're like we got to get out of here and they're about to leave and\n\n01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:17.600\nthey go down and uh and nicotero's head is on the on the and he's doing that they find that and she\n\n01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:24.160\nfinds the tape recorder and he's going it's my buckling father you know when frankenstein is\n\n01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:29.840\ndoing all the recording and then she freaks out like oh no oh my god no i never really understood\n\n01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:35.520\nwhat was your interpretation of that moment yes somebody this is the best use of robert kirkman\n\n01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:41.120\nof any podcast i hope no i i i can't remember exactly what he says but it it's mine the big\n\n01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:45.920\nfather it's mine stop stop it father i put it away father remember when yeah i don't know they're\n\n01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:49.440\nkind of vaguely implying i know the scene i don't think i ever understood what i didn't know if it\n\n01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:55.440\nwas somebody said oh he's fucking the zombies in the butt yeah i always thought there was some kind\n\n01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:03.840\nof one really really really but honestly i think that is the cinematic akam's razor because why\n\n01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:12.000\nelse is that recording a plot point yeah and i think that if you write backwards from the um if\n\n01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:20.320\nthe answer is it's a revelation that the doctor is fucking the zombie in the 70s the way you'd hear\n\n01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:26.080\nthat is a plot device on a tape recorder would be a bunch of weird improv about like\n\n01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:32.720\ndaddies and as opposed to because it wouldn't be like yeah if your zombie ass feels so good\n\n01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:38.800\nam i normal living dick that's so tight because it's fucking dead and cold it would be like it\n\n01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:44.240\nwould be it would have to be veiled all right by robert kirkman i mean if that was it would have to\n\n01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:50.640\nbe veiled like oh he's perverted and perverts talk about their talk about daddy you know while\n\n01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:56.720\nthey're doing nasty stuff but what's the alternative explanation is just that he's he's crazy or just\n\n01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:02.080\nthat he's yeah i think that her thing is she's like oh god we've been i've been defending him to the\n\n01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:07.200\nsoldiers this whole time and he's batshit insane he's out of his mind yeah but i would say if that's\n\n01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:13.920\ntrue double beat yeah i'm gonna do it because he's been fucking the zombie she knew that he was off\n\n01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:19.440\nyou know he was she was impatient with him too she just was like she's like a doctor what are we\n\n01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:24.320\ngonna do the fucking soldiers are getting worse than the zombies and and he's like civilized more\n\n01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:31.120\ndata that's like civilized so wait yeah if if there's a change in story direction as she's\n\n01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:39.680\nimplying with her shocked reaction it maybe maybe it's because i'm limited but it almost seems like\n\n01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:45.920\nit could only mean that she's finding out he was fornicating with the chained up zombie\n\n01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:51.200\ni feel like there must be another option but yeah i think you might be right i also want to say i\n\n01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:55.920\nhope that's i wish that wasn't true because i find that again as with the like whole bub evolution\n\n01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:01.760\ni find that stuff to be totally like not at all what's appealing about zombie mythology like i i\n\n01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:07.120\njust don't you know Schrab and i've talked about this endlessly but like it's just like the 70s\n\n01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:12.560\nhad it nailed at a certain point because it was like they're just a sea of death they're stupid\n\n01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:18.800\nthey're slow not that i mind the new run post 9 11 running zombies that shriek like bobcats and\n\n01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:25.600\nleap from rafters it obviously works for us too and it has its own resonance and either\n\n01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:30.560\nor situation i mean sometimes i like the movies where they're running and i like it in that movie but\n\n01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:36.080\ni mean i prefer the slower ones but it's not like oh these movies suck but the idea that the living\n\n01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:43.040\nare the wild cats the living are the problem because they're living the living are are unpredictable\n\n01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:48.720\nthe living are in and of themselves capable of ruining everything by pushing one button either\n\n01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:54.800\nin a conversation or on a switchboard whereas these fucking things have perfect order they have\n\n01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:01.520\nthe american dream slash the russian dream slash like the immortality like and like oh my god they're\n\n01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:07.040\ngonna get us but none of them are gonna high five each other or you know and it's like that's why that\n\n01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:14.080\nbub aspect of romero's dream always that distracted me too because i was like i don't i know i'm\n\n01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:19.760\nsupposed to like jump up in the theater and go one of them used a gun or learn to use a doorknob\n\n01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:26.880\nlike like not at all to me the point but yeah i mean i think uh i mean that's one of the aspects\n\n01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:31.600\nthat you know entertain me and you know engage me to the point that i actually did the walking\n\n01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:36.000\ndead i love that zombies by and large are a manageable threat you know if you and an\n\n01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.320\nexplorable one i mean you've explored them in so many ways that because you got to just like\n\n01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:45.040\nright and right you you've got to think over and over again we'll get sick of it eventually but\n\n01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:50.400\nbut but it's only a matter of time now it's you know it's it's fascinating to think about this\n\n01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:55.760\nyou know unrelenting like sea of danger that's out there and you know if you keep your wits about\n\n01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:00.880\nyou and you plan well you can do fine but yeah i'm gonna retire like i'm gonna retire i'm gonna\n\n01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:08.800\nhave that death where that doesn't end in that one shot where you go and your intestines are dragged\n\n01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:15.680\napart like a taffy bar i'm gonna be the one human being left that doesn't i do i do i do like my\n\n01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:20.560\nother favorite thing since i'm this drunk is the beginning of dawn of the dead the 70s one where\n\n01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:27.040\nit's just like it's such a freaky no not the apartment building that stuff's creepy fun tv\n\n01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:33.280\nstation it's the tv station that she's she's waking up what's her name poly i touch it's\n\n01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:39.360\nit's just like it's that she's the eyes in and it's just i love that the black and white one\n\n01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:45.280\nthey worshiped the television because if the television could just tell us what was going on\n\n01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:50.400\nand where we should go and then they worship their one car and it's like this perhaps unintentional\n\n01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:57.440\nbut spot-on resonant cultural thing of like it's black and white it's it has its roots in old\n\n01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:04.320\nschool classic horror films but it's fucking so raw and powerful because it's just fear and it's\n\n01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:10.080\njust like there's a black guy in the house it's almost a bigger problem than there's dead people\n\n01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:15.440\noutside eating brains and the young people understand that that's counterproductive and the\n\n01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:21.120\nand the guy with the control of the hammer and nails doesn't and and that if we could just get this tv\n\n01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:26.480\nworking oh the tv's like oh the tv gotta we gotta get it working and that the idea that you fade in\n\n01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:33.120\non the sequel at the tv station and it's full color now and it's like it's 70s and everyone's got\n\n01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:37.760\nbell bottoms and smokes weed but like you're pretending that the narrative just they work in\n\n01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:45.920\ntelevision where you're learning that this is the apocalypse will not be manageable by anybody\n\n01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:51.840\nall right sorry i'm sorry to your children i'm sorry to our listeners have you seen train to\n\n01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:58.320\nBusan no i'm not oh that was really awesome that was really good it's uh it's uh korean i believe\n\n01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:03.600\nzombie movie it's it's really great i recommend that they keep making good zombie movies i i'll\n\n01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:08.640\nbe the first person i could easily just go like too many zombie movies zombies are dead no pun\n\n01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:14.160\nintended but like it's it but i'll watch i keep watching them and then it doesn't it's almost\n\n01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:18.400\nlike it's like road movies you know it doesn't matter that there's a thousand of them it's like\n\n01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:23.680\nlike like there'll just be some swedish zombie movie going waves though i mean there was like\n\n01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:28.880\nwe didn't see zombie movies for a really long time and then they came back and then it's like\n\n01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:34.720\nvampires you know it's like like undead stuff it goes like i mean why do you think that is that\n\n01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:39.840\nlike what is it about society that makes us fascinated with like the undead and living\n\n01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:46.400\ndead like that for like an amount of time and then we move on to something else i don't know i mean i\n\n01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:52.000\nthink it's uh i don't know you like you got like one that's like super popular you're like a 28 days\n\n01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.240\nlater yeah and then that big gets like a land of the dead a dawn of the dead remake and a bunch of\n\n01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:01.200\ndifferent stuff and then it becomes so popular that they start making crappy ones and then people\n\n01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:06.320\nare like let's let this rest for a couple months yeah and then then they come back i feel like\n\n01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:11.360\nthat's the cycle i don't think there's any kind of like societal like oh i like feel guilty about\n\n01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:18.720\nall the horrible things that we're doing overseas and to get iphones and these are\n\n01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:25.040\nthe dead people coming to get us there's no living nightmare i don't think i don't think most people\n\n01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:30.320\nare aware of all the things we do to get iphones i don't go to like like a lot of action movies or\n\n01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:35.520\nlike um what the hell you say superhero movies or zombie movies whatever black panther is really\n\n01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:46.240\nburning up the charge top six top six oh boy thanks to uh it is a weird genre that's become a giant\n\n01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:51.280\nthing like there's this inundation of like like zombie stuff like that's that that is weird that\n\n01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:56.560\nthere's so much of it well it kind of is verging on into the ninth season of walking dead and the\n\n01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:03.360\n900th indie movie about like well my relationship's not going that well because there's a zombie attack\n\n01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:10.560\nlike it's it as many shitty ones as there are sure it's kind of verging on the hip hop thing where\n\n01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:16.560\nit's like you wanted to say like if you were waiting for it to be over that rap was a fad and\n\n01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:21.920\nthat it's like at a certain point you just went this is a genre this is not a thing this is not\n\n01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:28.480\nsomething and it's like i i think it's just that we don't have a healthy uh it's our our technology\n\n01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:36.240\nmeans conquering death in in a in a in the get it out of your living room way and so it's like\n\n01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:43.200\nalthough vampires will always have their um attraction they'll be rooted in as has been said\n\n01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:51.600\nsince the silent movie days that it's there's a sexuality there it's about them being humans that\n\n01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:59.200\nuh seduce and attract and manipulate and things and then there's these there's werewolves but\n\n01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:04.800\nwe don't werewolves were popular for like a the tiniest stint and it's like that's like a jekyll\n\n01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:10.320\nand hide thing where it's like oh i i'm fascinated with the idea that we can all at the drop of a\n\n01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:16.160\nhat turn into a fucking horrible hulk monster that it just wants to eat your face it's like\n\n01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:25.040\nit's like it's not a it doesn't take off the way saying everyone's dead everyone that touches you\n\n01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:31.920\nwill make you dead then you'll be dead but you'll never be dead because you can't be dead you'll\n\n01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:38.160\njust want to make other things dead you're you're a consumer in a in a sea of consumption and you'll\n\n01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:44.320\njust want to consume and for all you know aren't even if you're not already one of them don't you\n\n01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:52.000\nwish you were aren't they winning isn't it just it's just it's been the non-stop like it's like\n\n01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.480\nwaves of it come and go but it's like mounting in its appeal as a genre it's almost like 30 years\n\n01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:04.720\nfrom now there'll just be zombie channels zombie zombie you'll just be a i gotta get on that\n\n01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:10.400\nbut no i mean i think one of the things that does give zombies an edge over werewolves and\n\n01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:16.160\nvampires and things like that is that you know those stories are always about a person who's\n\n01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:22.160\nbecome a vampire a person who's become a werewolf but you don't do stories about the zombies every\n\n01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:26.720\nzombie story is about the people in the story and the zombies just window dressing so the genre\n\n01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:30.000\ni think lives on because you can be like well there's some soldiers in iraq and they're doing\n\n01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.040\nthis and then zombies show up you know there's some people at a baseball game and new york and\n\n01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:40.400\nzombie show like you take any story lachi's looking for buried jewish gold during world war two and\n\n01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:45.440\nthen zombies come out of the cup yeah it's aliens invade and then zombies show up but zombies are\n\n01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:50.160\nalso or at least like the stories that you tell was zombies are also kind of involved in the stories\n\n01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:56.640\nwe have in general anyway right it's like there's still you're trying to find food shelter safety\n\n01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:03.440\nit's like it's it's like all the the fears we have about real life apply more with zombies like\n\n01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:09.120\nsomeone randomly could just kill you like if you go outside it is dangerous you actually do\n\n01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:15.120\nhave to go find food to survive otherwise your kids will end up dead like it's it's a very extreme\n\n01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:21.120\nversion of like all these years is not working especially all this capitalist stuff though right\n\n01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:27.200\nlike the idea it's like we there is no more infrastructure like there are no more gas stations\n\n01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:32.480\nor refineries that like like that i think are these fears that come naturally out of like living\n\n01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:38.240\nliving under the shadow of alliances with the with the with a group of people just for survival\n\n01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:42.480\ncould be the thing that kills you that was the thing about donna the dead that was get really\n\n01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:49.120\nscary is that like how quickly the system fails you know when this this weird thing that no one\n\n01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:56.720\ncan explain or take care of happens and everybody turns against each other and you don't trust anybody\n\n01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:02.880\nand it's like you know like the cops are shooting each other because they're going crazy zombies\n\n01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:07.440\nzombies don't have garlic they don't have uh wooden stakes you have to put through their heart\n\n01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:16.320\ni like they're thwarted by locking the door which is our kryptonite because it means we have to be\n\n01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:23.920\nwith each other it's like fucking great yeah i mean it's uh it's a sartra especially with donna\n\n01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:31.360\nthe day of the dead it's like like the real threat is is the people inside that are like ready to\n\n01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:36.560\nshoot you because you're not pulling your weight or or they just want to or they're just like or\n\n01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:40.240\nthe people that lose their minds and open the door for all the others yeah yeah you think an\n\n01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:44.480\nargument could be made the next time you do a panel maybe you could mention this sure you were\n\n01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:50.560\nabout to get sick and tired of zombies and we really brought you back we kind of we kind of\n\n01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:56.080\nmade another three seasons of walking dead Harmontown saved the walking dead i think so i was definitely\n\n01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:59.840\non the edge but now you guys have got the wheels turning this was sort of an it's the word it's a\n\n01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:06.240\nwonderful word we're
